<text>Baroness Bertha Sophie Felicitas von Suttner (; ; 9 June 184321 June 1914) was an Austro-Bohemian noblewoman, pacifist and novelist. In 1905, she became the second female Nobel laureate (after Marie Curie in 1903), the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the first Austrian and Czech laureate.

==Early life==

Bertha Kinský was born on 9 June 1843 at Kinský Palace in the Obecní dvůr (cz) district of Prague. Her parents were the Austrian Lieutenant general () Franz Michael de Paula Josef Graf Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1769–1843), then recently deceased at the age of 75, and his young wife, Sophie Wilhelmine von Körner (1815–1884), who was almost fifty years his junior.

Her father was a member of the illustrious House of Kinsky via descent from Count Wilhelm Kinsky (1574–1634), being younger son of Count Franz Ferdinand Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1738–1806) and his wife, Princess Maria Christina Anna von und zu Liechtenstein (1741–1819), daughter of Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein. Bertha&#x27;s mother came from a family that belonged to an untitled nobility of significantly lower status, being the daughter of her husband&#x27;s comrade, Joseph von Körner (a captain of the cavalry in the Habsburg Imperial Army), a distant relative of the poet Theodor Körner. Through her mother, Bertha was also related to Theodor Körner, Edler von Siegringen, namesake and great-nephew of the poet, who later served as the 4th President of Austria.

For the rest of her life, Bertha faced exclusion from the Austrian high nobility due to her &quot;mixed&quot; descent; for instance, only those with an unblemished aristocratic pedigree back to their great-great-grandparents were eligible for presentation at the imperial court. She was additionally disadvantaged because her father, as a third son, had no great estates or other financial resources to bequeath. Bertha was baptised at Prague&#x27;s Church of Our Lady of the Snows – not a traditional choice for the aristocracy.

Soon after her birth, Bertha&#x27;s mother moved to live in Brno near Bertha&#x27;s guardian, Landgrave Friedrich Michael zu Fürstenberg-Taikowitz (1793–1866). Her older brother, Count Arthur Franz Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1827–1906), was sent to a military school at the age of six and subsequently had little contact with the family. In 1855, Bertha&#x27;s maternal aunt Charlotte (Lotte) Büschel, &quot;née&quot; von Körner (de) (also a widow), and her daughter Elvira joined the household. Elvira, whose father was a private scholar and whose official guardian, after the death of her father, became Count Johann Carl August von Huyn (1812-1889), was of a similar age to Bertha and interested in intellectual pursuits, introducing her cousin to literature and philosophy. Beyond her reading, Bertha gained proficiency in French, Italian and English as an adolescent, under the supervision of a succession of private tutors; she also became an accomplished amateur pianist and singer.

Bertha&#x27;s mother and aunt, regarding themselves as clairvoyant, went to gamble at Wiesbaden in the summer of 1856, hoping to return with a fortune. Their losses proved so heavy that they were forced to move to Vienna. During this trip, Bertha received a marriage proposal from Prince Philipp zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1836–1858), third son of Prince August Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (de) (Minister of State of the Duchy of Nassau) and his wife, Franziska Allesina genannt von Schweitzer (1802–1878), which was declined due to her young age. The family returned to Wiesbaden in 1859; the second trip proved similarly unsuccessful, and they had to relocate to a small property in Klosterneuburg. Shortly after this, Bertha wrote her first published work, the novella &quot;Erdenträume im Monde&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Die Deutsche Frau&quot;. Continuing poor financial circumstances led Bertha to a brief engagement to the wealthy Gustav, Baron Heine von Geldern, 31 years her senior and a member of the banking Heine family (de), whom she came to find unattractive and rejected; her memoirs record her disgusted response to the older man&#x27;s attempt to kiss her.

In 1864, the family spent the summer at Bad Homburg, a fashionable gambling-destination among the aristocracy of the era. Bertha befriended the Georgian aristocrat Ekaterine Dadiani, Princess of Mingrelia, and met Tsar Alexander II, to whom she was very distantly related. Seeking a career as an opera singer as an alternative to marrying into money, she undertook an intensive course of lessons, working on her voice for over four hours a day. Despite tuition from the eminent Gilbert Duprez in Paris in 1867, and from Pauline Viardot in Baden-Baden in 1868, she never secured a professional engagement. She suffered from stage fright and was unable to project well in performance. In the summer of 1872, she became engaged to Prince Adolf zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein (1839–1872), son of Prince Alexander zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein (1801–1874) and Countess Amalie Luise von Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda (1802–1887). Prince Adolf died at sea that October while travelling to America to escape his debts.

== Tutor in the Suttner household, life in Georgia ==

Bertha&#x27;s guardian (Landgrave Friedrich zu Fürstenberg) and her cousin Elvira both died in 1866, and she (now above the typical age of marriage) felt increasingly constrained by her mother&#x27;s eccentricity and the family&#x27;s poor financial circumstances. In 1873, she found employment as a tutor and companion to the four daughters of Karl, Freiherr von Suttner, who were aged between 15 and 20. The Suttner family (de) lived in the Innere Stadt of Vienna three seasons of the year, and spent the summer at Castle Harmannsdorf (de) in Lower Austria. She had an affectionate relationship with her four young students, who nicknamed her &quot;Boulotte&quot; (fatty) due to her size, a name she would later adopt as a literary pseudonym in the form &quot;B. Oulot&quot;.

She soon fell in love with the girls&#x27; elder brother, Baron (1850–1902), younger son of Karl Gundaccar Freiherr von Suttner (1819–1898) and his wife, Karola Knolz (b. 1822), who was seven years her junior. They were engaged but unable to marry due to his parents&#x27; disapproval. In 1876, with the encouragement of her employers, she answered a newspaper advertisement which led to her briefly becoming secretary and housekeeper to Alfred Nobel in Paris. In the few weeks of her employment, she and Nobel developed a friendship, and Nobel may have made romantic overtures. However, she remained committed to Arthur and returned shortly to Vienna to marry him in secrecy, in the church of St. Aegyd in Gumpendorf.

The newlywed couple eloped to Mingrelia in western Georgia, Russian Empire, near the Black Sea, where she hoped to make use of her connection to the former ruling House of Dadiani. On their arrival, they were entertained by Prince Niko. The couple settled in Kutaisi, where they found work teaching languages and music to the children of the local aristocracy. However, they experienced considerable hardship despite their social connections, living in a simple three-roomed wooden house. Their situation worsened in 1877 on the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War, although Arthur worked as a reporter on the conflict for the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;. Suttner also wrote frequently for the Austrian press in this period and worked on her early novels, including &quot;Es Löwos&quot;, a romanticised account of her life with Arthur. In the aftermath of the war, Arthur attempted to set up a timber business, but it was unsuccessful.

== Arthur and Bertha von Suttner ==
Arthur and Bertha von Suttner were largely socially isolated in Georgia; their poverty restricted their engagement with high society, and neither ever became fluent speakers of Mingrelian or Georgian. To support themselves, both began writing as a career. While Arthur&#x27;s writing during this period is dominated by local themes, Suttner&#x27;s was not similarly influenced by Georgian culture.

In August 1882, Ekaterine Dadiani died. Soon afterwards, the couple decided to move to Tbilisi. There, Arthur took whatever work he could (in accounting, construction and wallpaper design), while Suttner largely concentrated on her writing. She became a correspondent of Michael Georg Conrad, eventually contributing an article to the 1885 edition of his publication &quot;Die Gesellschaft&quot;. The piece, entitled &quot;Truth and Lies&quot;, is a polemic in favour of the naturalism of Émile Zola. Her first significant political work, &quot;Inventarium einer Seele&quot; (&quot;Inventory of the Soul&quot;), was published in Leipzig in 1883. In this work, Suttner takes a pro-disarmament, progressive stance, arguing for the inevitability of world peace due to technological advancement; a possibility also considered by her friend Nobel due to the increasingly deterrent effect of more powerful weapons.

In 1884, Suttner&#x27;s mother died, leaving the couple with further debts. Arthur had befriended a Georgian journalist in Tbilisi, M, and the couple agreed to collaborate with him on a translation of the Georgian epic &quot;The Knight in the Panther Skin&quot;. Suttner was to improve M.&#x27;s literal translation of the Georgian to French, and Arthur to translate the French to German. This method proved arduous, and they worked for few hours each day due to the distraction of the Mingrelian countryside around M.&#x27;s home. Arthur published several articles on the work in the Georgian press, and Mihály Zichy prepared some illustrations for the publication, but M. failed to make the expected payment, and after the Bulgarian Crisis began in 1885 the couple felt increasingly unsafe in Georgian society, which was becoming more hostile to Austrians due to Russian influence. They finally reconciled with Arthur&#x27;s family and in May 1885 could return to Austria, where the couple lived at Harmannsdorf Castle in Lower Austria.

Bertha found refuge in her marriage with Arthur, of which she remarked that &quot;the third field of my feelings and moods lay within our married happiness. In this was my peculiarly inalienable home, my refuge for all possible conditions of life, […] and so the leaves of my diary are full not only of political domestic records of all kinds, but also of memoranda of our gay little jokes, our confidential enjoyable walks, our uplifting reading, our hours of music together, and our evening games of chess. To us personally nothing could happen. We had each other – that was everything.&quot;

==Peace activism==
After their return to Austria, Suttner continued her journalism and concentrated on peace and war issues, corresponding with the French philosopher Ernest Renan and influenced by the International Arbitration and Peace Association founded by Hodgson Pratt in 1880.

In 1889, Suttner became a leading figure in the peace movement with the publication of her pacifist novel, &quot;Die Waffen nieder!&quot; (&quot;Lay Down Your Arms!&quot;), which made her one of the leading figures of the Austrian peace movement. The book was published in 37 editions and translated into 15 languages. She witnessed the foundation of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and called for the establishment of the Austrian &quot;Gesellschaft der Friedensfreunde&quot; pacifist organisation in an 1891 &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; editorial. Suttner became chairwoman and also founded the German Peace Society the next year. She became known internationally as the editor of the international pacifist journal &quot;Die Waffen nieder!&quot;, named after her book, from 1892 to 1899. In 1897, she presented Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria with a list of signatures urging the establishment of an International Court of Justice and took part in the First Hague Convention in 1899 with the help of Theodor Herzl, who paid for her trip as a correspondent of the Zionist newspaper, Die Welt.

Upon her husband&#x27;s death in 1902, Suttner had to sell Harmannsdorf Castle and moved back to Vienna. In 1904 she addressed the International Congress of Women in Berlin and for seven months travelled around the United States, attending a universal peace congress in Boston and meeting President Theodore Roosevelt.

Though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that Von Suttner was a major influence on his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will. Bertha von Suttner was awarded the Nobel Peace Price in the fifth term on 10 December 1905, together with her comrade, the legal scholar Tobias Asser (1838–1913) for their help in developing an international order based on peace rather than war. The presentation took place on 18 April 1906 in Kristiania.

In 1907, Von Suttner was the only woman to attend the Second Hague Peace Conference, which mainly pertained to the law of war. Von Suttner was actually highly critical of the 1907 conference, and warned of a war to come. When accepting her Nobel Peace prize, she said: &quot;(…) whether our Europe will become a showpiece of ruins and failure, or whether we can avoid this danger and so enter sooner the coming era of secure peace and law in which a civilisation of unimagined glory will develop. The many aspects of this question are what the second Hague Conference should be discussing rather than the proposed topics concerning the laws and practices of war at sea, the bombardment of ports, towns, and villages, the laying of mines, and so on. The contents of this agenda demonstrate that, although the supporters of the existing structure of society, which accepts war, come to a peace conference prepared to modify the nature of war, they are basically trying to keep the present system intact&quot;.

Around this time, she also crossed paths with Anna Bernhardine Eckstein, another German champion of world peace, who influenced the agenda of the Second Hague Peace Conference. A year later she attended the International Peace Congress in London, where she first met Caroline Playne, an English anti-war activist who would later write the first biography of Suttner.

In the run-up to World War I, Suttner continued to campaign against international armament. In 1911 she became a member of the advisory council of the Carnegie Peace Foundation. In the last months of her life, while suffering from cancer, she helped organise the next Peace Conference, intended to take place in September 1914. However, the conference never took place, as she died of cancer on 21 June 1914, and seven days later the heir to her nation&#x27;s throne, Franz Ferdinand was killed, triggering World War I.

Suttner&#x27;s pacifism was influenced by the writings of Immanuel Kant, Henry Thomas Buckle, Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin and Leo Tolstoy (Tolstoy praised &quot;Die Waffen nieder!&quot;)
 conceiving peace as a natural state impaired by the human aberrances of war and militarism. As a result, she argued that a right to peace could be demanded under international law and was necessary in the context of an evolutionary Darwinist conception of history. Suttner was a respected journalist, with one historian describing her as &quot;a most perceptive and adept political commentator&quot;.

== Writing ==

As a career writer, Suttner often had to write novels and novellas that she did not believe in or really want to write, to support herself. However, even in those novels there are traces of her political ideals; often, the romantic heroes would fall in love upon realising they were both fighting for the same ideals, usually peace and tolerance.

To promote her writing career and ideals, she used her connections in aristocracy and friendships with wealthy individuals, such as Alfred Nobel, to gain access to international heads of state, and also to gain popularity for her writing. To increase the financial success of her writing, she used a male pseudonym early in her career. In addition, Suttner often worked as a journalist to publicise her message or promote her own books, events, and causes.

As Tolstoy noted and others have since agreed, there is a strong similarity between Suttner and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Both Beecher Stowe and Suttner &quot;were neither simply writers of popular entertainment nor authors of tendentious propaganda... [They] used entertainment for idealistic purposes.&quot; For Suttner, peace and acceptance of all individuals and all peoples was the greatest ideal and theme.

Suttner also wrote about other issues and ideals. Two common issues in her work, apart from pacifism, are religion and sex.

=== Religion ===

There are two main issues with religion that Suttner often wrote about. She had a disdain for the spectacle and pomp of some religious practices. In a scene in &quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot; she highlighted the odd theatricality of some religious practices. In the scene, the emperor and empress are washing the feet of normal citizens to show they are as humble as Jesus, but they invite everyone to witness their show of humility and enter the hall in a dramatic fashion. The protagonist Martha remarks that it was &quot;indeed a sham washing.&quot;

Another issue prominent in much of her writing is the idea that war is righteously for God, and leaders often use religion as a pretext for war. Suttner criticised this reasoning on the grounds that it placed the state as the important entity to God rather than the individual, thereby making dying in battle more glorious than other forms of death or surviving a war. Much of &quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot; discusses this topic.

This type of religious thinking also leads to segregation and fighting based on religious differences, which Bertha and Arthur von Suttner refused to accept. As a devout Christian, Arthur founded the League Against Anti-Semitism in response to the pogroms in Eastern Europe and the growing antisemitism across Europe. The Suttner family called for acceptance of all people and all faiths, with Suttner writing in her memoirs that &quot;religion was neighbourly love, not neighbourly hatred. Any kind of hatred, against other nations or against other creeds, detracted from the humaneness of humanity.&quot;

=== Sex ===

Suttner is often considered a leader in the women&#x27;s liberation movement.

Von Suttner broke through sex barriers by her work as a writer and activist. She was an outspoken leader in a society in which women were to be seen, not be heard. But she did not actively participate in the movements for women&#x27;s suffrage, for instance, which she explained due to a lack of time. She instead focused on reaching out to other women in the international peace movement, though she kept close contact to the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. As a sign of joint solidarity, for instance, Von Suttner was a prominent participant of the 1904 &#x27;International Women&#x27;s Conference&#x27; (&#x27;Internationale Frauen-Kongress&#x27;) in Berlin. Von Suttner knew, though, that conflict can only be avoided if both men and women together struggle for peace, which required an absolute belief in sex equality. &quot;The tasks involved in mankind&#x27;s continuing ennoblement are such that they can only be fulfilled through fair and equal cooperation between the sexes&quot;, she wrote.

In &quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot;, the protagonist Martha often clashes with her father on this issue. Martha does not want her son to play with toy soldiers and be indoctrinated to the masculine ideas of war. Martha&#x27;s father attempts to put Martha back in the female sexed box by suggesting that the son will not need to ask for approval from a woman, and also states that Martha should marry again because women her age should not be alone.

This was not simply because she insisted that women are equal to men, but that she was able to tease out how sexism affects both men and women. Like Martha being placed in a female structured sex box, the character of Tilling is also placed in the male stereotyped box and affected by that. The character even discusses it, saying, &quot;we men have to repress the instinct of self-preservation. Soldiers have also to repress the compassion, the sympathy for the gigantic trouble which invades both friend and foe; for next to cowardice, what is most disgraceful to us is all sentimentality, all that is emotional.&quot;

<doc id="55452" wikidata="Q55282" url="?curid=55452" title="Peter Greenaway">
<text>Peter Greenaway, (born 5 April 1942) is a British film director, screenwriter and artist. His films are noted for the distinct influence of Renaissance and Baroque painting, and Mannerist painting in particular. Common traits in his films are the scenic composition and illumination and the contrasts of costume and nudity, nature and architecture, furniture and people, sexual pleasure and painful death.

==Early life==
Greenaway was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales, to a teacher mother and a builder&#x27;s merchant father. Greenaway&#x27;s family had relocated to Wales prior to his birth to escape the Blitz. They returned to the London area at the end of World War II and settled in Woodford, then part of Essex. He attended Churchfields Junior School and later Forest School in nearby Walthamstow.

At an early age Greenaway decided on becoming a painter. He became interested in European cinema, focusing first on the films of Ingmar Bergman, and then on the French &quot;nouvelle vague&quot; filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard and, most especially, Alain Resnais. Greenaway has said that Resnais&#x27;s &quot;Last Year in Marienbad&quot; (1961) had been the most important influence upon his own filmmaking (and he himself established a close working relationship with that film&#x27;s cinematographer Sacha Vierny). He now lives in Amsterdam.

==Career==

===1962–1999===

In 1962, Greenaway began studies at Walthamstow College of Art, where a fellow student was musician Ian Dury (later cast in &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot;). Greenaway trained as a muralist for three years; he made his first film, &quot;Death of Sentiment&quot;, a churchyard furniture essay filmed in four large London cemeteries. In 1965, he joined the Central Office of Information (COI), where he went on to work for fifteen years as a film editor and director. In that time he made a series of experimental films, starting with &quot;Train&quot; (1966), footage of the last steam trains at Waterloo station (situated behind the COI), edited to a &quot;musique concrète&quot; composition. &quot;Tree&quot; (1966) is a homage to the embattled tree growing in concrete outside the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank in London. In the late 1970s, he made &quot;Vertical Features Remake&quot; and &quot;A Walk Through H&quot;. The former is an examination of various arithmetical editing structures, and the latter is a journey through the maps of a fictitious country.

In 1980, Greenaway delivered &quot;The Falls&quot; (his first feature-length film) – a mammoth, fantastical, absurdist encyclopaedia of flight-associated material all relating to ninety-two victims of what is referred to as the Violent Unknown Event (VUE). In the 1980s his cinema flowered in his best-known films, &quot;The Draughtsman&#x27;s Contract&quot; (1982), &quot;A Zed &amp; Two Noughts&quot; (1985), &quot;The Belly of an Architect&quot; (1987), &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot; (1988), and his most successful film, &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot; (1989). Greenaway&#x27;s most familiar musical collaborator during this period is composer Michael Nyman, who has scored several films.

In 1989, Greenaway collaborated with artist Tom Phillips on a television serial &quot;A TV Dante&quot;, dramatising the first few cantos of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. In the 1990s he presented &quot;Prospero&#x27;s Books&quot; (1991), the controversial &quot;The Baby of Mâcon&quot; (1993), &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; (1996), and &quot;8½ Women&quot; (1999).

In the early 1990s Greenaway wrote ten opera libretti known as the &quot;Death of a Composer&quot; series, dealing with the commonalities of the deaths of ten composers from Anton Webern to John Lennon; however, the other composers are fictitious, and one is a character from &quot;The Falls&quot;. In 1995, Louis Andriessen completed the sixth libretto, &quot;Rosa – A Horse Drama&quot;. He is currently professor of cinema studies at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.

===2000–present===
Greenaway presented the ambitious &quot;The Tulse Luper Suitcases&quot;, a multimedia project that resulted in three films, a website, two books, a touring exhibition, and a shorter feature which reworked the material of the first three films.

He also contributed to &quot;Visions of Europe&quot;, a short film collection by different European Union directors; his British entry is &quot;The European Showerbath&quot;. &quot;Nightwatching&quot; and &quot;Rembrandt&#x27;s J&#x27;Accuse&quot; are two films on Rembrandt, released respectively in 2007 and 2008. &quot;Nightwatching&quot; is the first feature in the series &quot;Dutch Masters&quot;, with the second project titled as &quot;Goltzius and the Pelican Company&quot;.

On 17 June 2005, Greenaway appeared for his first VJ performance during an art club evening in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with music by DJ Serge Dodwell (aka Radar), as a backdrop, &#x27;VJ&#x27; Greenaway used for his set a special system consisting of a large plasma screen with laser controlled touchscreen to project the ninety-two &quot;Tulse Luper&quot; stories on the twelve screens of &quot;Club 11&quot;, mixing the images live. This was later reprised at the Optronica festival, London.

On 12 October 2007, he created the multimedia installation &quot;Peopling the Palaces at Venaria Reale&quot; at the Royal Palace of Venaria, which animated the Palace with 100 videoprojectors.

Greenaway was interviewed for Clive Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Critical Cinema: Beyond the Theory of Practice&quot; (2011), and voiced strong criticisms of film theory as distinct from discussions of other media: &quot;Are you sufficiently happy with cinema as a thinking medium if you are only talking to one person?&quot;

On 3 May 2016, he received a Honoris Causa doctorate from the University of San Martín, Argentina.

===&quot;Nine Classical Paintings Revisited&quot;===
In 2006, Greenaway began a series of digital video installations, &quot;Nine Classical Paintings Revisited&quot;, with his exploration of Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Night Watch&quot; in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. On 30 June 2008, after much negotiation, Greenaway staged a one-night performance &#x27;remixing&#x27; da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot; in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan to a select audience of dignitaries. The performance consisted of superimposing digital imagery and projections onto the painting with music from the composer Marco Robino.

Greenaway exhibited his digital exploration of &quot;The Wedding at Cana&quot; by Paolo Veronese as part of the 2009 Venice Biennial. An arts writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;possibly the best unmanned art history lecture you&#x27;ll ever experience,&quot; while acknowledging that some viewers might respond to it as &quot;mediocre art, Disneyfied kitsch or a flamboyant denigration of site-specific video installation.&quot; The 50-minute presentation, set to a soundtrack, incorporates closeup images of faces from the painting along with animated diagrams revealing compositional relations among the figures. These images are projected onto and around the replica of the painting that now stands at the original site, within the Palladian architecture of the Benedictine refectory on San Giorgio Maggiore. The soundtrack features music and imagined dialogue scripted by Greenaway for the 126 &quot;wedding guests, servants, onlookers and wedding crashers&quot; depicted in the painting, consisting of small talk and banal chatter that culminates in reaction to the miraculous transformation of water to wine, according to the Gospels the first miracle performed by Jesus. Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;, Seurat&#x27;s &quot;Grande Jatte&quot;, works by Jackson Pollock and Claude Monet, Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Las Meninas&quot; and Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; are possible series subjects.

<text>The Coptic alphabet is the script used for writing the Coptic language, the most recent development of Egyptian. The repertoire of glyphs is based on the uncial Greek alphabet, augmented by letters borrowed from the Egyptian Demotic. It was the first alphabetic script used for the Egyptian language. There are several Coptic alphabets, as the script varies greatly among the various dialects and eras of the Coptic language.

==History==


The Coptic script has a long history going back to the Ptolemaic Kingdom, when the Greek alphabet was used to transcribe Demotic texts, with the aim of recording the correct pronunciation of Demotic. As early as the sixth century BC and as late as the second century AD, an entire series of pre-Christian religious texts were written in what scholars term Old Coptic, Egyptian language texts written in the Greek alphabet.

In contrast to Old Coptic, seven additional Coptic letters were derived from Demotic, and many of these (though not all) are used in “true” form of Coptic writing. Coptic texts are associated with Christianity, Gnosticism, and Manichaeism.

With the spread of early Christianity in Egypt, knowledge of Egyptian hieroglyphs was lost by the late third century, as well as Demotic script slightly later, making way for a writing system more closely associated with the Coptic Orthodox Church. By the fourth century, the Coptic script was &quot;standardized&quot;, particularly for the Sahidic dialect. (There are a number of differences between the alphabets as used in the various dialects in Coptic).

Coptic is not generally used today except by the members of the Coptic Orthodox Church to write their religious texts. All the Gnostic codices found at Nag Hammadi used the Coptic script.

The Old Nubian alphabet—used to write Old Nubian, a Nilo-Saharan language—is an uncial variant of the Coptic script, with additional characters borrowed from the Greek and Meroitic scripts.

== Form ==
The Coptic script was the first Egyptian writing system to indicate vowels, making Coptic documents invaluable for the interpretation of earlier Egyptian texts. Some Egyptian syllables had sonorants but no vowels; in Sahidic, these were written in Coptic with a line above the entire syllable. Various scribal schools made limited use of diacritics: some used an apostrophe as a word divider and to mark clitics, a function of determinatives in logographic Egyptian; others used diereses over and to show that these started a new syllable, others a circumflex over any vowel for the same purpose.

The Coptic script&#x27;s glyphs are largely based on the Greek alphabet, another help in interpreting older Egyptian texts, with 24 letters of Greek origin; 6 or 7 more were retained from Demotic, depending on the dialect (6 in Sahidic, another each in Bohairic and Akhmimic). In addition to the alphabetic letters, the letter ϯ stood for the syllable or .

As the Coptic script is simply a typeface of the Greek alphabet, with a few added letters, it can be used to write Greek without any transliteration schemes. Latin equivalents would include the Icelandic alphabet (which likewise has added letters), or the Fraktur alphabet (which has distinctive forms). While initially unified with the Greek alphabet by Unicode, a proposal was later accepted to separate it, with the proposal noting that Coptic is never written using modern Greek letter-forms (unlike German, which may be written with Fraktur or Roman Antiqua letter-forms), and that the Coptic letter-forms have closer mutual legibility with the Greek-based letters incorporated into the separately encoded Cyrillic alphabet than with the forms used in modern Greek. Because Coptic lowercases are usually small-caps forms of the capitals, a Greek would have little trouble reading Coptic letters, but Copts would struggle more with many of the Greek letters.

== Letters ==
These are the letters that are used for writing the Coptic language. Coptic did not originally have case distinctions—they are a modern convention, as is the case with other classical languages like Latin.

=== Letters derived from Demotic ===
In Old Coptic, there were a large number of Demotic Egyptian characters, including some logograms. This was reduced to seven such characters, used for sounds not covered by the Greek alphabet (plus their modern lowercase forms):

=== Numerals ===
Coptic numerals are an alphabetic numeral system in which numbers are indicated with letters of the alphabet, such as for 500.
The numerical value of the letters is based on Greek numerals. Sometimes numerical use is distinguished from text with a continuous overline above the letters, as with Greek and Cyrillic numerals.

== Unicode ==
In Unicode, most Coptic letters formerly shared codepoints with similar Greek letters, but a disunification was accepted for version 4.1, which appeared in 2005. The new Coptic block is U+2C80 to U+2CFF. Most fonts contained in mainstream operating systems use a distinctive Byzantine style for this block. The Greek block includes seven Coptic letters (U+03E2–U+03EF highlighted below) derived from Demotic, and these need to be included in any complete implementation of Coptic.

== Diacritics and punctuation ==

These are also included in the Unicode specification.

=== Punctuation ===
* Latin alphabet punctuation (comma, period, question mark, semicolon, colon, hyphen) uses the regular Unicode codepoints for punctuation
* Dicolon: standard colon U+003A
* Middle dot: U+00B7
* En dash: U+2013
* Em dash: U+2014
* Slanted double hyphen: U+2E17

=== Combining diacritics ===

These are codepoints applied after that of the character they modify.

* Combining overstroke: U+0305 (= supralinear stroke)
* Combining character-joining overstroke (from middle of one character to middle of the next): U+035E
* Combining dot under a letter: U+0323
* Combining dot over a letter: U+0307
* Combining acute accent: U+0301
* Combining grave accent: U+0300
* Combining circumflex accent (caret shaped): U+0302
* Combining circumflex (curved shape) or inverted breve above: U+0311
* Combining circumflex as wide inverted breve above joining two letters: U+0361
* Combining diaeresis: U+0308

===Macrons and overlines===

Coptic uses to indicate syllabic consonants, for example .

Coptic abbreviations use to draw a continuous line across the remaining letters of an abbreviated word. It extends from the left edge of the first letter to the right edge of the last letter. For example, , a common abbreviation for &#x27;spirit&#x27;.

A different kind of overline uses , , and to distinguish the spelling of certain common words or to highlight proper names of divinities and heroes.
For this the line begins in the middle of the first letter and continues to the middle of the last letter. A few examples: , , .

Sometimes numerical use of letters is indicated with a continuous line above them using as in for 1,888 (where &quot; is 1,000 and &quot; is 888). Multiples of 1,000 can be indicated by a continuous double line above using as in for 1,000.

<text>The 10th millennium BC spanned the years 10,000 BC to 9001 BC (c. 12 ka to c. 11 ka). It marks the beginning of the transition from the Palaeolithic to the Neolithic via the interim Mesolithic (Northern Europe and Western Europe) and Epipaleolithic (Levant and Near East) periods, which together form the first part of the Holocene epoch that is generally believed to have begun c. 9700 BC (c. 11.7 ka) and is the current geological epoch. It is impossible to precisely date events that happened around the time of this millennium, and all dates mentioned here are estimates mostly based on geological analysis, anthropological analysis, and radiometric dating.

==Holocene epoch==
The main characteristic of the Holocene has been the worldwide abundance of &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot; (humankind). The epoch began in the wake of the Würm glaciation, generally known as the Last Ice Age, which began 109 ka and ended 14 ka when &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot; was in the Palaeolithic (Old Stone) Age. Following the Late Glacial Interstadial from 14 ka to 12.9 ka, during which global temperatures rose significantly, the Younger Dryas began. This was a temporary reversal of climatic warming to glacial conditions in the Northern Hemisphere and coincided with the end of the Upper Palaeolithic. The Younger Dryas ceased c. 9700 BC, marking the cutover from Pleistocene to Holocene.

In the geologic time scale, there are three (tentatively four) stratigraphic stages of the Holocene beginning c. 9700 BC with the &quot;Greenlandian&quot; (to c. 6236 BC). The starting point for the Greenlandian is the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) sample from the North Greenland Ice Core Project, which has been correlated with the Younger Dryas. The Greenlandian was succeeded by the &quot;Northgrippian&quot; (to c. 2250 BC) and the &quot;Meghalayan&quot;. All three stages were officially ratified by the International Commission on Stratigraphy in July 2018. It has been proposed that the Meghalayan should be terminated c. 1950 and succeeded by a new stage provisionally called &quot;Anthropocene&quot;.

In the Holocene&#x27;s first millennium, the Palaeolithic began to be superseded by the Neolithic (New Stone) Age which lasted about 6,000 years, depending on location. The gradual transition period is sometimes termed Mesolithic (northern and western Europe) or Epipalaeolithic (Levant and Near East). The glaciers retreated as the world climate became warmer and that inspired an agricultural revolution, though at first, the dog was probably the only domesticated animal. This was accompanied by a social revolution in that humans gained from agriculture the impetus to settle. Settlement is the key precursor to civilisation, which cannot be achieved by a nomadic lifestyle.

The world population, c. 10,000 BC, is believed to have been more or less stable. It has been estimated that there were some five million people at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, growing to forty million by 5000 BC and 100 million by 1600 BC, which is an average growth rate of 0.027% p.a. from the Neolithic to the Middle Bronze Age. Around 10,000 BC, most people lived in hunter-gatherer communities scattered across all continents except Antarctica and Zealandia. As the Würm/Wisconsin ended, settlement of northern regions was again possible.

==Beginnings of agriculture==
Agriculture developed in different parts of the world at different times. In many places, people learned how to cultivate without outside help; elsewhere, as in western Europe, the skills were imported. A decrease in human height accompanied the rise of agriculture near the start of the Holocene period (10,000 BC) and was later correlated with urban population density.

The Natufian culture prevailed in the Levant through the 10th millennium and was unusual in that it supported a sedentary or semi-sedentary population even before the introduction of agriculture. An early example is &#x27;Ain Mallaha, which may have been the first village in which people were wholly sedentary. The Natufian people are believed to have founded another early settlement on the site of Jericho (Tell es-Sultan) where there is evidence of building between 9600 BC and 8200 BC. Dates for the Natufian are indeterminate and range broadly from c. 13,050 BC to c. 7550 BC. It is possible that the early cultivation of figs began in the Jordan River valley sometime after the middle of the 10th millennium. Besides the fig trees, the people may have begun cultivation of wild plants such as barley and pistachio; and they possibly began herding goats, pigs and cattle.

Agriculture began to be developed by the various communities of the Fertile Crescent, which included the Levant, but it would not be widely practised for another 2,000 years by which time Neolithic culture was becoming well established in many parts of the Near East. Among the earliest cultivated plants were forms of millet and rice grown in the Middle East, possibly in this millennium but more likely after 9000 BC. By about 9500 BC, people in south-eastern Anatolia were harvesting wild grasses and grains. The earliest evidence of sheep herding has been found in northern Iraq, dated before 9000 BC.

==Pottery==
Prehistoric chronology is almost entirely reliant upon the dating of material objects of which pottery is by far the most widespread and the most resistant to decay. All locations and generations developed their own shapes, sizes and styles of pottery, including methods and styles of decoration, but there was consistency among stratified deposits and even shards can be classified by time and place. Pottery is believed to have been discovered independently in various places, beginning with China c. 18,000 BC, and was probably created accidentally by fires lit on clay soil. The main discovery of pottery dated to the 10th millennium has been at Bosumpra Cave (early tenth-millennium cal. BC) on the Kwahu Plateau in southeastern Ghana and Ounjougou (c.9400 BC) in Central Mali, providing evidence of an independent invention of pottery in Sub-Saharan Africa in different climatic zones.

The first chronological pottery system was the Early, Middle and Late Minoan framework devised in the early 20th century by Sir Arthur Evans for his findings at Knossos. This covered the Bronze Age in twelve phases from c. 2800 BC to c. 1050 BC and the principle was later extended to mainland Greece (Helladic) and the Aegean islands (Cycladic). Dame Kathleen Kenyon was the principal archaeologist at Tell es-Sultan (ancient Jericho) and she discovered that there was no pottery there. The potter&#x27;s wheel had not yet been invented and, where pottery as such was made, it was still hand-built, often by means of coiling, and pit fired.

Kenyon discovered vessels such as bowls, cups, and plates at Jericho which were made from stone. She reasonably surmised that others made from wood or vegetable fibres would have long since decayed. Using Evans&#x27; system as a benchmark, Kenyon divided the Near East Neolithic into phases called Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), from c. 10,000 BC to c. 8800 BC; Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), from c. 8800 BC to c. 6500 BC; and then Pottery Neolithic (PN), which had varied start-points from c. 6500 BC until the beginnings of the Bronze Age towards the end of the 4th millennium. In the 10th millennium, the Natufian culture co-existed with the PPNA which prevailed in the Levantine and upper Mesopotamian areas of the Fertile Crescent.

==Other cultural developments==
===Africa===

In North Africa, Saharan rock art engravings in what is known as the Bubalus (Large Wild Fauna) period have been dated to between 10,000 BC and 7000 BC. Wall paintings found in Ethiopia and Eritrea depict human activity; some of the older paintings are thought to date back to around 10,000 BC. In Prehistoric Egypt, a culture of hunter-gatherers replaced a grain grinding culture in 10,000 BC. The Abu Madi tel mounds in the Sinai Peninsula have been dated c. 9660 to c. 9180 BC.

===Americas===
The Clovis culture was widely distributed throughout North America. The people were hunter-gatherers and the culture&#x27;s duration is believed to have been from c.9050 BC to c.8800 BC. There is evidence of increasing use of Clovis point tool technology for hunting.

Elsewhere in North America, the Petroglyphs at Winnemucca Lake, in what is today northwest Nevada, were carved by this time, possibly as early as 12.8 ka or as late as 10 ka.

===Eurasia===
The sites at Göbekli Tepe, which is home to megalithic structures, Hallan Çemi Tepesi, both in south-eastern Anatolia, and at Tell Qaramel, in north-west Syria, may have been occupied during this millennium. It was found out that gastronomy first emerged in Göbekli Tepe in this millennium. This most important discovery shedding light on the beginning of gastronomy in Anatolia consists of religious places in which feasts were held in this millennium that were found in the archaeological excavations conducted in Göbekli Tepe in Urfa province which is called the zero point of time. As a result of the investigations carried out in Göbekli Tepe which is dated to this millennium, it was determined that the people created cult structures and had a culture for religious purposes during the early Neolithic period and that they held feasts in which they offered foods while performing these cultures. The Sassi di Matera in southern Italy is believed to have been the site of human settlement since the Paleolithic period in this millennium, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in history. At the Hasankeyf Mound in Turkey, Europe, almost all archaeological data date to this millennium. In Great Britain, which was not then an island, the Star Carr site in North Yorkshire is believed to have been inhabited by Maglemosian peoples for about 800 years from c. 9335 BC to c. 8525 BC.

The Bhimbetka rock shelters, which feature prehistoric cave paintings, earliest being dated to 10,000 BCE, corresponds to the Indian Mesolithic. These sites would have been home to a nomadic/hunting society existing in this region.

==Environmental changes==

In the southern hemisphere, rising sea levels had gradually formed Bass Strait, separating Tasmania from mainland Australia. This process is believed to have been complete by about the beginning of the 10th millennium. Bass Strait had been a plain populated by indigenous people who are thought to have first arrived around 40,000 years ago.

The Wisconsin glaciation had sheeted much of North America and, as it retreated, its meltwaters created an immense proglacial lake now known as Lake Agassiz. Sometime after 10,000 BC, the retreating glaciers created the rock formation on Cannon Mountain in present-day New Hampshire that was known as the Old Man of the Mountain until its collapse in 2003.

==Chronological method==
The ongoing Quaternary System/Period represents the last 2.58 million years since the end of the Neogene and is officially divided into the Pleistocene and Holocene Series/Epochs. The Holocene has been assigned an age of 11,700 calendar years before 2000 CE which means it began c. 9700 BC in the 10th millennium. It is preceded in the geological time scale by the Late Pleistocene sub-epoch, also known as the Tarantian Stage/Age, which awaits formal ratification by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) and tentatively spans the time from c. 126,000 BC to c. 9700 BC. Preceding the Late Pleistocene is the Middle Pleistocene sub-epoch, or Chibanian Stage/Age, which also awaits ratification and tentatively spans the time from c. 773,000 BC to c. 126,000 BC. The Early Pleistocene from c. 2,580,000 BC until c. 773,000 is sub-divided into two Stages/Ages which have been officially defined: the Gelasian (until c. 1,800,000 BC) and the Calabrian.

The Holocene calendar, devised by Cesare Emiliani in 1993, places its epoch at 10,000 BC (with the year 2025 being rendered as 12025 HE). The Human Era calendar attempts to simplify the calculation of time spans across the BC-CE divide by designating a more universally relevant epoch date: the start of human settlements (instead of the birth of Jesus Christ). CE dates can be converted by adding 10,000 years; converting BC dates requires subtraction from 10,001 (since the Gregorian calendar lacks a year zero).

<doc id="55459" wikidata="Q2000835" url="?curid=55459" title="Princess of Wales">
<text>Princess of Wales () is a title used since the 14th century by the wife of the Prince of Wales. The Princess is the apparent future queen consort, as &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; is a title reserved by custom for the heir apparent to the British throne, and earlier the English throne. The current title-holder is Catherine (née Middleton).

When the title was first recorded it was not connected to the English throne; it developed in an independent Wales when it was held by Eleanor de Montfort, the wife of the native Prince of Wales Llywelyn ap Gruffydd.

== Background ==
Prior to &#x27;Princess&#x27; (Welsh: ) the title of &#x27;Queen&#x27; (Welsh: ) was used by some spouses of the rulers of Wales. Examples are Angharad ferch Owain, wife of Gruffudd ap Cynan, and Cristin verch Goronwy, wife of Gruffudd&#x27;s son, Owain Gwynedd (specifically, she was known as &#x27;Queen Dowager&#x27;). 

== The title in independent Wales ==

=== Joan (Siwan) ===
Joan, also known as Siwan (her Welsh name), was the illegitimate daughter of King John of England. She was the wife of Llywelyn the Great (initially king of Gwynedd), effective ruler of all of Wales. During her tenure, she used the titles &#x27;Lady of Wales&#x27; and &#x27;Lady of Snowdon&#x27;.

=== Eleanor de Montfort and Gwenllian ===
Following her wedding ceremony in 1278, Eleanor de Montfort was officially known as princess of Wales. On 19 June 1282, she died giving birth to her first child, Gwenllian.

The infant was captured by English forces the following year, after her father, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, was killed in December 1282. At Edward I&#x27;s orders, she was kept in the remote Sempringham Priory in Lincolnshire, where she remained until her death in 1337.

Gwenllian&#x27;s status was acknowledged at least once by the English Crown. When writing to the pope, attempting to secure more money for Sempringham Priory, the king stated that &quot;...herein is kept the Princess of Wales, whom we have to maintain&quot;. The title &#x27;Princess of Wales&#x27; as used here did not have its usual accepted meaning.

=== Margaret Hanmer and Catrin, daughter of Glyndŵr ===
Margaret Hanmer, sometimes known as Marred ferch Dafydd (her Welsh name), was the wife of Owain Glyndŵr. Some modern historians have accorded her the title &#x27;Princess of Wales&#x27;.

Catrin was one of the children of Owain Glyndŵr and Margaret Hanmer. In November 1402, she married Sir Edmund Mortimer, the second son of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March and through his mother, a great-grandson of Edward III of England.

Edmund Mortimer died during the siege of Harlech Castle in 1409, of unknown causes. Catrin was subsequently captured alongside her three daughters, and they were taken to the Tower of London, along with Catrin&#x27;s mother and one of her sisters. The deaths and burials of Catrin and her daughters are recorded, but the causes of their deaths remain unknown. They were laid to rest at St Swithin&#x27;s Church in London.

=== List ===
== Spouse of the British (formerly English) heir apparent ==
Cecily Neville, wife of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, is omitted from this list. While her husband was briefly given various titles, including prince of Wales, by an Act of Parliament as part of his arrangement to succeed Henry VI, he is not generally recognised as such and is not mentioned in any published summary of the topic.

Although not granted the title in her own right, the future Mary I was, during her youth, invested by her father, Henry VIII, with many of the rights and properties traditionally given to the Prince of Wales, including the use of the official seal of Wales for correspondence. For most of her childhood, Mary was her father&#x27;s only legitimate child, and for this reason, she was often referred to as the Princess of Wales, although Henry never formally created her as such. For example, contemporary scholar Juan Luis Vives dedicated his &quot;Satellitium Animi&quot; to &quot;Dominæ Mariæ Cambriæ Principi, Henrici Octavi Angliæ Regis Filiæ&quot; (&quot;Lady Mary, Prince of Wales, Daughter of Henry VIII, King of England&quot;).

Welsh politicians suggested that George VI&#x27;s elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II), be granted the title on her 18th birthday, but he rejected the idea because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the title of the heir apparent.

Camilla, Charles III&#x27;s second wife, was the Princess of Wales from 2005 to until she became queen consort in 2022, but did not use the title due to its popular association with her husband&#x27;s first wife, Diana.

On 9 September 2022, a day after his accession to the throne, Charles III bestowed the title of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; upon his elder son, William, hence making his wife, Catherine, the Princess of Wales.

<doc id="55460" wikidata="Q463141" url="?curid=55460" title="Doñana National Park">
<text>Doñana National Park or Parque Nacional y Natural de Doñana is a natural reserve in Andalusia, southern Spain, in the provinces of Huelva (most of its territory within the municipality of Almonte), Cádiz and Seville. It covers , of which are a protected area.
It is named after wife of the 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia.

The park is an area of marshes, shallow streams, and sand dunes in Las Marismas, the delta where the Guadalquivir River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It was established as a nature reserve in 1969 when the World Wildlife Fund joined with the Spanish government and purchased a section of marshes to protect it. The eco-system has been under constant threat by the draining of the marshes, the use of river water to boost agricultural production by irrigating land along the coast, water pollution by upriver mining, and the expansion of tourist facilities. 

Doñana National Park has a biodiversity that is unique in Europe, although there are some similarities to the Parc Naturel Régional de Camargue of the Camargue river delta in France, with which Doñana Park is twinned. The park features a great variety of ecosystems and shelters wildlife, including thousands of European and African migratory birds, fallow deer, Spanish red deer, wild boars, European badgers, Egyptian mongooses, and endangered species such as the Spanish imperial eagle and the Iberian lynx.

The Doñana nature reserve includes both the Doñana National Park, established in 1969, and the Natural Park, created in 1989 and expanded in 1997, creating a buffer zone of protection under the management of the regional government. The two parks, national and natural, have since been classified as a single natural landscape. Due to its strategic location between the continents of Europe and Africa and its proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar, Doñana&#x27;s large expanse of salt marsh is a breeding ground as well as a transit point for thousands of European and African birds (aquatic and terrestrial), and hosts many species of migratory waterfowl during the winter, typically up to 200,000 individuals. Over 300 different species of birds may be sighted there annually. Considered the largest nature reserve in Europe, several different scientific institutions have monitoring stations within its boundaries to ensure appropriate development of adjacent lands and conservation of the threatened species that inhabit it. The area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994; in 2006, the park recorded 376,287 visitors.

==Geology and geomorphology==

The geological profile of Doñana National Park reflects the development over several hundred thousand years of a deep aquifer and geomorphological features that have enhanced the biodiversity of the wildlife habitats presently found there. After the end of the last glacial period, the area was covered by freshwater and brackish marshes, ponds and sand dunes, with some marine intrusions caused by high-energy events such as tsunamis and large storms. A period of comparatively rapid rise in global sea level during the first part of the Flandrian interglacial was associated with the melting of the paleoglaciers, and reached its maximum level 6,500–7,000 years ago. At this time, Doñana National Park and the surrounding areas were flooded, and a lagoon, later called &quot;Lacus Ligustinus&quot; by the Romans, was formed. The pace of infilling of the lagoon has increased over the last 6,000 years, along with accelerated growth of sandspits and the creation of new inland marshes and wetlands. The extensive marshes of Doñana National Park now have a flat topography, with some inland depressions occupied by temporary or permanent wetlands, locally called &#x27;lucios&#x27;. The whole area is protected by the Doñana spit, a wide sandy littoral barrier with mobile dune systems growing toward the southeast.

==History==

===Antiquity===

Although the topography of Doñana is a relatively new land feature as measured on the geological time scale, remains of Neolithic tools have been found in the area. Various ancient civilizations may have had a presence there as long as 2,800 years ago, including the Phoenicians, the Phocaean Greeks and the Tartessians, but archaeological remains attesting to such have not been found. In 1923, the German archaeologist Adolf Schulten, accompanied by Adolf Lammerer and George Bonsor, searched for the location of the ancient Tartessian capital in Almonte, where the Doñana dunes are, but found nothing of interest. These excavations were carried out at Cerro del Trigo and funded by the Duke of Tarifa and Denia, then owner of Doñana. Nevertheless, in 1978 Schulten found the stele of Villamanrique at the nearby town of Villamanrique de la Condesa. Surveys were made in 2007 in the Hinojos salt marsh, or &quot;Marisma de Hinojos&quot;, of Huelva province, in an effort to discover traces of the mythical city. Noteworthy finds included the remains of Roman settlements, dating from the 2nd through the 5th centuries AD, which had been primarily engaged in fishing and fish salting or the preparation of garum. The Guadalquivir Marshes (&quot;Las Marismas del Guadalquivir&quot;), an area of marshy lowlands near the left bank of the mouth of the Guadalquivir, was then a large inland lake known as the &quot;Lacus Ligustinus&quot; in Latin. The lake slowly infilled with deposited sediment, gradually giving way to the current marshes.

===Middle Ages===
;Alfonso X the Wise
In 1262, after conquering the vassal kingdom of Niebla, King Alfonso X established a &quot;Real Cazadero&quot; (royal hunting preserve) in the Las Rocinas forest, between the Rio Tinto and the Guadalquivir, partly due to the abundance of deer there, as well as the small sanctuary of Santa Olalla, since disappeared, on the &quot;Arroyo de la Rocina&quot;.

In 1297, his son Sancho IV granted Guzmán el Bueno the Lordship of Sanlúcar, consisting of the territory located behind Arenas Gordas on the left bank of the Guadalquivir estuary, and which remained in the hands of the House of Medina-Sidonia for over six centuries. The noble house was established in 1369, when Henry II of Castile granted the fourth Lord of Sanlúcar the County of Niebla. In 1493 the Catholic Monarchs donated part of the land of the present village of El Rocío to the royal secretary, whose son later sold it to the town of Almonte. Previously, new breeding stock had been introduced among the local populations of wild boar and deer, while wolf hunting was encouraged for the benefit of cattle and horse ranching.

===Early modern===
Nearly a century later, Alonso Pérez de Guzmán y Sotomayor, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia and commander of the Spanish Armada, bought back part of the land. His wife, Ana de Silva y Mendoza, daughter of the Princess of Eboli, moved to a country retreat there called &quot;Coto de Doña Ana&quot; (Doña Ana Game Preserve), which was the origin of the current name &quot;Doñana&quot;; the house was renovated years later as a palace. Reference to the use of Coto Donana as a hunting lodge is made in the first verses of the &quot;La Fábula de Polifemo y Galatea&quot; (Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea), which the lyric poet Luis de Góngora dedicated to the Count of Niebla, and in which he requests that the nobles suspend their hunting exploits to hear his verses. In 1624, King Philip IV stayed at the estate for several days as a guest of the 9th Duke of Medina Sidonia, and joined in some large hunts. He brought with him a great variety of comestibles, which included such luxuries as snow from the mountains for the frequent banquets he held in honor of the duke. In 1797 Francisco Goya stayed in the palace as a guest of his patrons, the 15th Duke of Medina-Sidonia and his wife, the 13th Duchess of Alba. Here Goya created his &quot;Álbum A&quot;, a collection of drawings, and apparently painted his famous portraits, &quot;La Maja Vestida&quot; (&quot;The Clothed Maja&quot;) and &quot;La Maja Desnuda&quot; (&quot;The Naked Maja&quot;), rumored to portray the duchess.

===Late modern, creation of the National Park===
After 1854, with the publishing of a discussion of the area in a treatise called &quot;Avifauna de Doñana: Catálogo de las aves observadas en algunas provincias andaluzas&quot; (&quot;Avifauna of Doñana: Catalogue of the birds observed in some Andalusian provinces&quot;), by Antonio Machado y Nunez, the public began to appreciate its ecological value for the many different species of wildlife found there. Consequently, it was visited by British naturalists and hunters including Abel Chapman and Walter J. Buck, both of whom wrote books that alerted a wider audience in Europe to the strategic importance of Doñana for migratory birds traveling to Africa. Later, when José Joaquín Álvarez de Toledo y Caro (1865-1915) became the 19th Duke of Medina Sidonia, he inherited large debts and to pay them was forced to sell off various assets, including the Coto de Doñana, which he sold for 750,000 pesetas, finally detaching it from the noble house.

When the sherry baron William Garvey bought Doñana from the Duke in 1901, the estate was abandoned and in a state of ruin. Garvey restored the palace to its former splendor, and upon his death it passed to his brother Joseph and his niece Maria Medina y Garvey, who was married to the Duke of Tarifa, a forest engineer. In 1934 it passed to the sister of the Duchess of Tarifa, Blanca Medina and Garvey, who was married to the Marquis of Borghetto. In 1942, the Marquis sold it to a company formed by Salvador Noguera, Manuel Gonzalez and the Marquis of Mérito. Fifty years later the park was consolidated as a natural area.

===Conservation===

The Spanish businessman Mauricio González-Gordon y Díez, Marquis of Bonanza, whose family owned a large estate in Doñana, became interested in its ecosystems and their birdlife, and invited ornithologists from all over Europe to visit. In 1952, the Spanish ornithologists José Antonio Valverde and Francisco Bernis visited the property, with González-Gordon serving as their guide. Valverde and the González-Gordon family saw that the wetlands, with their richly diverse wildlife, were threatened by the Spanish government&#x27;s proposals to drain them for farming and the planting of eucalyptus trees. Mauricio, together with his father, asked Bernis to try and influence Spanish dictator Francisco Franco into abandoning the plans. The trio wrote a memorandum which was presented to Franco himself by Mauricio&#x27;s father Manuel. By November 1953 Bernis had finished a report on the status of the Doñana which showed that the area had exceptional ecological value. The group sought and obtained international support for their goals. The efforts of González-Gordon to dissuade Franco exposed him to some danger, but the Franco government conceded and the drainage plans were aborted.

Valverde led the first organised scientific expedition to the Donana in 1957, joined by the British naturalists Guy Mountfort, Roger Peterson, and Sir Julian Huxley. A group of European conservation experts – including Guy Monfort, Max Nicholson and Luc Hoffmann –then demonstrated the crucial importance of the area as a stopover for birds migrating between the European and African continents. In 1959, the Gonzalez family sold part of their land in Doñana for development of the Matalascañas resort. This alarmed European conservationists, leading various institutions and anonymous donors to offer to buy part of the property. Valverde, Hoffman, and Nicholson, in partnership with the British Nature Conservancy, formed an association that organised an international drive for funds to expand the park. The campaign raised two million Swiss Francs to buy 7,000 hectares of land for annexation to that already donated by González-Gordon. Finally, in 1963 the Spanish government and WWF bought part of the territory and created the first Doñana preserve, and in 1964 they established the Doñana Biological Station and the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas - CSIC) to study the biodiversity of Doñana and other Spanish ecosystems.
In 1969, the WWF again joined forces with the Spanish government to purchase another section of the Guadalquivir Delta marshes and establish the Doñana National Park.
That same year the Doñana National Park was created by decree, part of whose territory was owned by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad) and part still in private hands. Ten years later the protected area was expanded and the so-called &quot;Preparque Doñana&quot; was created. In 1980, UNESCO recognised the Doñana National Park as a Biosphere Reserve of 77,260 hectares. The Core Zone consists of 50,720 hectares in the National Park of Doñana. The buffer zone is 54,250 hectares in the Natural Park of Doñana. The altitude ranges from sea level to 40 meters above sea level. Unesco considers Doñana of world significance, based on the variety of its ecosystems and the wide number of species they harbor. In 1982 it was included in the list of wetlands of the Ramsar Convention, and in 1989 the Regional Government of Andalusia converted the Preparque into the Doñana Natural Park. In 1994 it was listed by Unesco as a World Heritage Site, enabling the establishment of programs to preserve and manage the area. Historically, these vital wetlands have been constantly threatened by schemes to increase local agricultural output and tourism. WWF still supports the Doñana, and is fighting proposals to drain the marshes and syphon off water for irrigation of agricultural land along the coast and expansion of tourist facilities.

In 1998, the Aznalcóllar Disaster occurred when a holding dam burst at the Los Frailes mine owned by Boliden-Apirsa (formerly Andaluza de Piritas, S.A.), the Spanish subsidiary of Boliden, releasing a flood of toxic sludge that entered the River Guadiamar, the main water source for the park. In 2000, after this major environmental catastrophe, the Spanish Ministry of Environment promoted the &quot;Doñana 2005&quot; program, aimed at regenerating the marshes. In 2006 the responsibilities of maintaining the park were transferred to the Government of Andalusia by the Royal Decree of 9 June; the functions and services of the Nature Conservation administration thus transferred to the Andalusian state were widened, and Doñana National Park and the Natural Park became the &quot;Natural area of Doñana&quot;, a single territory divided into areas with different levels of environmental protection. In 2008 this park was twinned with the Regional Natural Park Camargue in France, with which it shares anthropological and ethnographic aspects.

During his tenure, the Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González began using Doñana as a vacation retreat, setting a precedent for his successors. In 2010, 9200 hectares of land on the coastline were expropriated by the former Ministry of the Environment for protection. In July 2012, Unesco approved the extension of the Biosphere Reserve of Doñana from 77,260 hectares to over 255,000 hectares and enabled compliance with the guidelines of the Man and Biosphere Program. This created a transition zone where the socio-economic interests of the various municipalities in the Doñana region are represented. In 2019, the police closed tens of illegal wells operated largely by fruit farmers around the park which had for many years been draining water away from the park&#x27;s water table. In the same year, the EU commission decided to take Spain to the European Court of Justice (EJC) for violating EU conservation rules. The court ruled in favor of the EU commission, stating that Spain has not fulfilled its obligations concerning the prevention of illegal water extraction as well as failed to take necessary measures to stop significant modifications of the park&#x27;s landscape.
In 2023 the Junta de Andalucia sought to approve some of the illegal strawberry cultivation taking place near the park, but was blocked by the central government. The Junta made an effort to mitigate damage to the national park by the acquisition of 7,000 ha of an estate called Veta la Palma. This property includes lagoons which had been used for a failed fishing farming enterprise within the natural park and which at the time of purchase were seen as a potential extension to the national park.

In January 2024 the bird count was the lowest on record, reflecting low water levels in the National Park.

==Climate==
Doñana Park has a mild, typically Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and relatively wet winters resulting from variations in the polar front and the subtropical ridge of high pressure. The rainy seasons are intermediate, occurring in spring and in autumn; autumn especially can produce torrential rains caused by the accumulation during the summer of heat in nearby large bodies of water, and the arrival of polar air masses. In winter, however, thermal anticyclones may occur locally. Temperatures are mild throughout the year, with maximum temperatures varying about 17 °C from winter to summer. The most significant feature of the climate is the three to five months of dry weather in the summer, when it is dominated by the subtropical anticyclone.

==Flora==
There are many species of flora in the park: trees, including pines, flowers such as roses, and shrubs. Of special interest are the species &quot;Vulpia fontquerana&quot;, &quot;Tursica linaria&quot;, &quot;Juniperus macrocarpa&quot; (maritime juniper), &quot;Micropyropsis tuberosa&quot;, &quot;Hydrocharis morsus-ranae&quot; or &quot;Thorella verticillatinundata&quot;, many of them endangered. Non-native species such as eucalyptus, &quot;Acacia longifolia&quot;, &quot;Gomphocarpus fruticosus&quot;, &quot;Nicotiana glauca&quot; or &quot;Carpobrotus edulis&quot; (cat&#x27;s claw) are removed by the park service.

Other notable species in the park, of the more than 875 indigenous to the Doñana ecosystems are: oleander, oak, the sea wallflower, sweet saltwort, the prickly tumbleweed, marram grass, heather, camarina, lavender, sea holly, reed, carnation, bulrush, common fern, sage-leaved rock rose, rushes, labiérnago (&quot;Phillyrea angustifolia&quot;), sea spurge, mastic, sedge, palm, pine, Scotch broom, rosemary, juniper, gorse, thyme, spurge and blackberries.

===Flora of the transdunes===

The ecosystem of the mobile dunes, also known as transdunes, which are formed by the prevailing south-west wind, is almost nonexistent elsewhere in the Iberian Peninsula. The harshness of this ecosystem is evident in the adaptations made by some plant species to its special conditions: the dunes of sand and soil are inconsistent. The gradual burial of vegetation, especially of trees that emerge then die, killed by the slow movement of sand, is one of the most well-known phenomena in the beach area of the park.

==Fauna==
Animals recorded within the park include 20 species of freshwater fish, 10 species of amphibians, 13 species of reptiles, 37 species of mammals and 360 non-marine bird species, of which 127 have bred in the park.

===Fish===
Native fish such as eel inhabit Doñana as well as introduced species such as carp, and the gambusia, or pike, which is considered an invasive threat to local ecosystems. Also, you could find the sturgeon in the past because nowadays is extinct.

===Reptiles===
Reptiles found in Doñana Park include the European pond turtle, Spanish pond turtle, spur-thighed tortoise, Iberian worm lizard, Bedriaga&#x27;s skink, western three-toed skink, common wall gecko, spiny-footed lizard, ocellated lizard, Carbonell&#x27;s wall lizard, Andalusian wall lizard, &quot;Psammodromus manuelae&quot;, Spanish psammodromus, horseshoe whip snake, ladder snake, southern smooth snake, Montpellier snake, false smooth snake, viperine snake, grass snake, Lataste&#x27;s viper, loggerhead turtle and leatherback turtle.

===Birds===

Over 300 species of bird have been recorded in the area, including range-restricted species such as Spanish imperial eagle, marbled teal, white-headed duck and red-knobbed coot. Wetland species include glossy ibis, western swamphen, ferruginous duck, Eurasian spoonbill, red-crested pochard, little and cattle egret, night and squacco heron and greater flamingo, whilst the surrounding areas can have hoopoe, stone-curlew, Spanish sparrow, Mediterranean short-toed lark and pin-tailed sandgrouse. The site also attracts many summer migrants, which can include purple heron, gull-billed tern, greater short-toed lark, short-toed eagle, European roller, western olivaceous warbler, Savi&#x27;s warbler, little bittern, booted eagle, whiskered tern and rufous scrub robin.

===Mammals===
38 mammal species have been recorded, including twelve species of bat, red deer, European rabbit, European hedgehog, common genet, wildcat, wild boar, Iberian lynx, garden dormouse, Egyptian mongoose, greater white-toothed shrew, Eurasian otter, wood mouse, European polecat, red fox, European badger, Mediterranean pine vole, southwestern water vole and black rat.

====Iberian lynx====

The Iberian lynx, whose habitat is restricted to the Iberian Peninsula, is the most endangered of the big cats. Precipitous drops in population counts led to its being declared a protected species in 1966. The only extant colonies of the Iberian lynx are in the Natural Parks of Sierra de Andujar and Cardena, Montoro, and Doñana with its surroundings; the other mainland colonies of former times are considered extinct. In Portugal recovery efforts to preserve its remaining habitat have resulted in the creation of the Sierra Malcata Natural Reserve.

The Acebuche Breeding Centre in Doñana has developed a captive breeding program which has achieved the survival of eleven individuals born in the centre, and of over thirty captured in the park, whose survival was otherwise doubtful. These conservation efforts are threatened by a high mortality rate among the cats and recurring violations of laws prohibiting cars from entering the park or driving on its roads, although, as some agencies have reported, the causes of death are not always clear. The precarious survival situation of this animal has become an emblematic symbol of the park for the general public.

====Horses====
In Doñana there are two indigenous breeds of horse: the Marismeño and the Retuertas; the latter is one of the oldest European breeds, dating to perhaps 1000 BC, and the only one living in the wild and isolated from other populations.

====Camels====
During the 19th and 20th centuries, a herd of feral dromedaries roamed the area. They may have been introduced during the Moorish Conquest of Spain in the 8th century, or they may have escaped from a herd introduced from the Canary Islands in 1829 by the Marquis de Molina as beasts of burden. By the 1950s, there were only eight individuals left, and these were threatened by poachers. By the early 1960s, there were only three, but more were released into the wild after being used in the filming of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; in 1962.

==Natural Park of Doñana: Preparque==
* Abalario–Asperillo. The coastal area west of the national park from Matalascañas to Mazagon, forming a rectangle 25 km in length and reaching about 5 km inland, consists of a field of dunes, several ancient lagoons and wetlands, as well as a large forest of pine and eucalyptus trees. It shelters abundant wildlife, including the Iberian lynx. This zone includes the towns of Matalascañas and Mazagon, as well as the El Arenosillo test Centre, a rocket launch site for suborbital rockets, but its declaration as a national park blocked the construction of a large urban project west of Matalascañas.
* Preparque Norte–Pinares de Hinojos (North Preparque Pinewoods of Hinojos) stretches north of the National Park from El Rocío to Hinojos, with areas of marsh and forest. The &quot;Pinar del Pinto&quot; of Coto del Rey, between Aznalcázar and Villamanrique de la Condesa, is home to several species of raptors.
* Preparque Este–Brazo de la Torre-Entremuros. An area east of the National Park, between Brazo de la Torre and the Guadalquivir, with marshes and caños (tidal channels that reach into the muddy marsh land). It attracts birds that inhabit Doñana during the summer and during those winters in which drought occurs. Part of the marshes have been converted to rice cultivation.

* Pinar de la Algaida–Marismas de Bonanza. An area southeast of the National Park and north of Sanlúcar de Barrameda on the left bank of the River Guadalquivir, that includes a large forest of pines and marshes in Salinas. These marshes are the only ones still flooded by the tides (all the others rely solely on freshwater streams and rain for replenishment), and consequently, flamingos and avocets are found in them. &quot;Algaida&quot; is a word of Arabic origin, meaning generally any place covered with trees and bushes. &quot;El Pinar de la Algaida&quot; is located near the henarllo, a sanctuary dedicated to the female deity Astarte, and the site of the Roman well of Caveros. Restocking has been practised at Algaida since the early 19th century, and it now contains a large colony of black kites.

==Environmental Problems==
After the Aznalcóllar Dam disaster of 1998, public awareness of the environmental risks to which the countryside is exposed has increased. Various impact studies and environmental groups have warned repeatedly of problems that threaten the region&#x27;s flora, fauna, water and soil. While the pressure of urbanization and its various demands on local ecosystems has been a concern throughout the years, this is not the only associated risk factor. UNESCO has reviewed the nomination of the park for inclusion in its &quot;List of World Heritage in Danger&quot; several times, but has yet to add it.

===Impact of infrastructure===
There have been a number of problems related to infrastructure near the park. A project to build an oil pipeline between Extremadura and the port of Huelva has been criticized by environmental groups, who allege it would significantly increase tanker traffic in the area with an associated risk of oil spills. Frequent dredging of the Guadalquivir to allow passage of ships to the port of Seville has been observed to cause serious disturbances in the biodynamics of the estuary. Adena, the &quot;Associación de defensa de la naturaleza&quot; (Association for the defence of nature), the Spanish branch of WWF, has linked the passage of these boats with the introduction of new animals to the local ecosystems, which occurs when they discharge ballast water containing exotic species.
The Port of Huelva, a few kilometers from the Natural Park, is one of its major environmental threats. Francisco Bella, PSOE senator and former mayor of the town of Almonte Huelva, considers it absurd that the pipeline project has been approved while the national government and the regional government of Andalusia invest in renewable energy. As mayor of Almonte, he noted the difficulties of implementing policies that promote employment near the park: (translation) &quot;...we know almost everything about the ant and the lynx, but need to know how employment evolves in Doñana.&quot; In line with Bella&#x27;s position regarding the aqueduct, Ginés Morata, a biologist and former president of the &quot;Consejo de Participación de Doñana&quot; (Participation Council of Doñana), says that the project, which involves the passage of hundreds of oil tankers per year that would unload their cargoes near Doñana, would lead to an increased possibility of oil spills.

===Overexploitation of water resources===
Another environmental problem is water withdrawals for irrigation, many of them illegal, which have doubled since the late 1980s to maintain water-intensive crops such as cotton, rice and more recently strawberries. The latter are grown in greenhouses, with an estimated area under plastic of between 4,500 and 6,000 hectares in the Doñana area, producing over 90% of the Spanish strawberry crop. The boring of illegal wells to draw irrigation water from underground aquifers has apparently proliferated, while the water demands of nearby residential complexes and inappropriate usage of the water resources of nearby rivers may also affect the hydrology of the park. Other potential risks include salinization resulting from climate change; the intrusion of salt water from the Atlantic would endanger several animal species. On the other hand, desertification could also occur; recently a transfer from the Chanza-Piedras water system was approved by the &quot;Diputación de Huelva&quot; (Provincial Council of Huelva) to alleviate this eventuality.

===Impact of agriculture===
In 2007, the World Wildlife Fund warned that strawberry farms surrounding the park, where 95% of Spanish strawberries were produced, threatened to cause catastrophic damage to the park by depleting the surrounding groundwater, notably where illegal boreholes were involved, as well as creating considerable pesticide pollution and plastic waste which was accumulating in local creeks; AFP further reported that WWF was calling for a boycott of Spanish strawberries, but this is contradicted by the remarks of a WWF Spain spokesperson, and it is uncharacteristic of WWF to call for blanket boycotts.

===Aznalcóllar disaster===
On 25 April 1998, a holding dam burst at the Los Frailes mine operated by the mining company, Boliden-Apirsa, near Aznalcóllar, Seville Province, releasing 4–5 million cubic metres of mine tailings. The acidic tailings, which contained dangerous levels of several heavy metals, quickly reached the nearby River Agrio, and then its tributary the River Guadiamar, travelling about 40 kilometres along these waterways before they could be stopped and advancing as far as the prepark. The cleanup operation took three years, at an estimated cost of €240 million. Although the spill was slowed by levees and diverted by way of the Guadalquivir to the sea, the vulnerability of Doñana&#x27;s ecosystems to such environmental catastrophes was evident.

To ensure sustainable development both in the countryside and in the surrounding provinces, as well as to counteract future environmental threats, an International Commission of Experts met in 1992 to propose solutions, and produced the &quot;Plan de Desarrollo Sostenible de Doñana y su Entorno&quot; (Plan for Sustainable Development of Doñana and its Surroundings), briefly described as:


This effectively became the mission statement of the Doñana 21 Foundation, created in 1997 as a partnership between the Governing Council of the Andalusian Regional Government and the El Monte, San Fernando and Unicaja savings banks. The plan established among its objectives the promotion of actions beneficial to the natural environment, seeking the cooperation of national and European governmental bodies, and the various organizations with an interest in the park, economic or otherwise, for sustainable development of the area (e. g., by encouraging the organic farming of rice). Since then, representatives from Council agencies, businesses, trade unions and conservation organizations such as WWF have joined the foundation and collaborated in meeting its goals.

===Pipeline===
In 2013 the construction of a pipeline in the vicinity of the park was authorized by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment.

===Pilgrimage of El Rocío and ecological issues===

The municipality of Almonte, and therefore the park, is situated in an area in which public manifestations of religious fervor have been frequent throughout the centuries. The deities of nature and water were worshiped by the ancient Iberians, as in the goddess cult of Cybele. The cult rituals, similar in many ways to current Rocieras celebrations, were quickly adapted by the early Christians of these lands to be assimilated in their liturgy. They built a small basilica here, now defunct, but it was mainly after the reconquest of the area in 1262 that the Marian devotions were institutionalized. About 1270–1284, Alfonso X reconstructed the Chapel of St. Mary of Rocinas, and in 1337 Alfonso XI made the first recorded mention of the Marian cult in the area:

The image of the Virgin at the Hermitage of El Rocío dates probably from the 13th century, although the current iconography representing the Virgin as a lady of the royal court was adopted in the late 16th century, according to the fashion of the time. The popularity of the cult of the &quot;Virgen del Rocío&quot; in modern times has raised concerns about the annual pilgrimage&#x27;s effect on the natural environment of the park.

The park is used by pilgrims on their way to the Romería de El Rocío. As this event attracts a million pilgrims annually, it has a significant negative impact on the park&#x27;s eco-system. The overcrowding of pilgrims around certain dates is evident not only in the village of El Rocío where the shrine is located, but also in places within and outside the park such as the Piara del Acebuchal, the Ajolí Bridge, Boca del Lobo and the Moguer road. This has been a publicity windfall for the park, but requires stepped-up park resources for fire prevention and general monitoring, and also has had a significant negative environmental impact (e.g., increased danger of wildfires, off-road SUVs damaging sensitive ground, etc.) denounced by environmentalists.

Wildfires are a recurrent issue for the park - see .

==Doñana Biological Station==
 (&quot;Estación Biológica de Doñana&quot;) is a centre dedicated to the study of terrestrial ecology. It was created jointly in 1964 by the Spanish government and the World Wildlife Federation to support scientific research on local ecosystems; in the course of this research the status of other national and international ecosystems is also investigated. The EBD, as an administrative and scientific management agency under the aegis of the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas – CSIC), operates a research centre in Seville, the Doñana Biological Reserve in Almonte, and a Field Station in the Natural Park of Sierras de Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas in the province of Jaén. After the World Wildlife Fund was created in 1961, one of its first actions was to acquire 6,794 hectares of the Doñana estate &#x27;Las Nuevas&#x27; in 1963, which it then turned over to the CSIC. The CSIC declared the area to be a &quot;Reserva Biológica&quot; (Biological Reserve) and in 1964 built the &quot;Estación Biológica de Doñana&quot;. WWF bought another section of Doñana in 1968 totaling 3,214 hectares and later called the &quot;Reserva Biológica de Guadiamar&quot; (Guadiamar Biological Reserve).

== Saca de las Yeguas ==
Another important activity of longstanding association with the park is &quot;La &quot; (&quot;The Gathering of the Mares&quot;), a livestock event from Almonte pertaining to the indigenous wild horses of the salt marshes of Doñana. On 26 June, after the Feast of St. John the Baptist is celebrated, mares and new foals among the &quot;marismeños&quot; are gathered in a traditional roundup.

==Other points of interest==

<text>A high-occupancy vehicle lane (also known as an HOV lane, carpool lane, diamond lane, 2+ lane, and transit lane or T2 or T3 lanes) is a restricted traffic lane reserved for the exclusive use of vehicles with a driver and at least one passenger, including carpools, vanpools, and transit buses. These restrictions may be only imposed during peak travel times or may apply at all times. There are different types of lanes: temporary or permanent lanes with concrete barriers, two-directional or reversible lanes, and exclusive, concurrent, or contraflow lanes working in peak periods.

The normal minimum occupancy level is two or three occupants. Many jurisdictions exempt other vehicles, including motorcycles, charter buses, emergency and law enforcement vehicles, low-emission and other green vehicles, and/or single-occupancy vehicles paying a toll. HOV lanes are normally introduced to increase average vehicle occupancy and persons traveling with the goal of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution.

==History==
===United States===

The introduction of HOV lanes in the United States progressed slowly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Major growth occurred from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. The first freeway HOV lane in the United States was implemented in the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway in Northern Virginia, between Washington, DC, and the Capital Beltway, and was opened in 1969 as a bus-only lane. The busway was opened in December 1973 to carpools with four or more occupants, becoming the first instance in which buses and carpools officially shared a HOV lane over a considerable distance.

In 2005, the two lanes of this HOV 3+ facility carried during the morning peak hour (6:30 am to 9:30 am) a total of 31,700 people in 8,600 vehicles (3.7 persons/veh), while the three or four general-purpose lanes carried 23,500 people in 21,300 vehicles (1.1 persons/veh). Average travel time in the HOV facility was 29 minutes, and 64 minutes in the general traffic lanes. As of 2012, the I-95/I-395 HOV facility is long, extends from Washington, D.C., to Dumfries, Virginia, and has two reversible lanes separated from the regular lanes by barriers, with access through elevated on- and off-ramps. Three or more people in a vehicle (HOV 3+) are required to travel on the facility during rush hours on weekdays.

The second freeway HOV facility, which opened in 1970, was the contraflow bus lane on the Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix in Hudson County, New Jersey. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Lincoln Tunnel XBL is the country&#x27;s HOV facility with the highest number of peak hour persons among HOV facilities with utilization data available, with 23,500 persons in the morning peak, and 62,000 passengers during the four-hour morning peak.

The first permanent HOV facility in California was the bypass lane at the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge toll plaza, opened to the public in April 1970. The El Monte Busway (I-10 / San Bernardino Freeway) in Los Angeles was initially only available for buses when it opened in 1973. Three-person carpools were allowed to use the bus lane for three months in 1974 due to a strike by bus operators, and then permanently at a 3+ HOV from 1976. It is one of the most efficient HOV facilities in North America and was converted into a high-occupancy toll lane operation in 2013 to allow low-occupancy vehicles to bid for excess capacity on the lane in the Metro ExpressLanes project.

Beginning in the 1970s, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration recognized the advantages of exclusive bus lanes and encouraged their funding. In the 1970s the FHWA began to allow state highway agencies to spend federal funds on HOV lanes. As a result of the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo, interest in ridesharing picked up, and states began experimenting with HOV lanes. In order to reduce crude oil consumption, the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act mandated maximum speed limits of on public highways and became the first instance when the U.S. federal government provided funding for ridesharing and states were allowed to spend their highway funds on rideshare demonstration projects. The 1978 Surface Transportation Assistance Act made funding for rideshare initiatives permanent.

Also during the early 1970s, ridesharing was recommended for the first time as a tool to mitigate air quality problems. The 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and gave the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) substantial authority to regulate air quality attainment. A final control plan for the Los Angeles Basin was issued in 1973, and one of its main provisions was a two-phase conversion of of freeway and arterial roadway lanes to bus/carpool lanes and the development of a regional computerized carpool matching system. However, it took until 1985 before any HOV project was constructed in Los Angeles County, and by 1993 there were only of HOV lanes countywide.

A significant policy shift took place in October 1990, when a memorandum from the FHWA administrator stated that &quot;FHWA strongly supports the objective of HOV preferential facilities and encourages the proper application of HOV technology.&quot;&quot; Regional administrators were directed to promote HOV lanes and related facilities. Also in the early 1990s, two laws reinforced the U.S. commitment to HOV lane construction. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included HOV lanes as one of the transportation control measures that could be included in state implementation plans to attain federal air quality standards. The 1990 amendments also deny the administrator of the EPA the authority to block FHWA from funding 24-hour HOV lanes as part of the sanctions for a state&#x27;s failure to comply with the Clean Air Act, if the secretary of transportation wishes to approve the FHWA funds.

On the other hand, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 encouraged the construction of HOV lanes, which were made eligible for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds in regions not attaining federal air quality standards. CMAQ funds may be spent on new HOV lane construction, even if the HOV designation holds only at peak travel times or in the peak direction. ISTEA also provided that under the Interstate Maintenance Program, only HOV projects would receive the 90% federal matching ratio formerly available for the addition of general purpose lanes. ISTEA, in addition, permitted state authorities to define a high occupancy vehicle as having a minimum of two occupants (HOV 2+).

As of 2009, California was the state with the most HOV facilities in the country, with 88, followed by Minnesota with 83 facilities, Washington with 41, Texas with 35, and Virginia with 21. By 2006, HOV lanes in California were operating at two-thirds of their capacity, and these HOV facilities carried on average 2,518 persons per hour during peak hours, substantially more people than the congested general-traffic lanes.

As of October 2016, the longest continuous HOV facility in the U.S. is on I-15 in Utah, extending approximately from Layton to Spanish Fork with a single HOV lane in each direction for a total of of HOV lanes. While the Utah facility is the longest, the I-495 Capital Beltway in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area extends but has two HOV lanes in each direction for a total of of HOV lanes.

On October 24, 2023, Michigan opened its first-ever HOV lanes on a portion of I-75 in Oakland County from South Boulevard in Bloomfield Township to 12 Mile Road in Madison Heights as part of a freeway modernization project. One lane in both directions is restricted to HOV use from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, while all other drivers regardless of the number of occupants in their vehicle can freely use the lanes outside of those hours. 
===Canada===
The first HOV facilities in Canada were opened in Greater Vancouver and Toronto in the early 1990s, followed shortly by facilities in Ottawa, Gatineau, Montreal, and later Calgary. As of 2010 there were about of highway HOV lanes in 11 locations in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, and over of arterial HOV lanes in 24 locations in Greater Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Gatineau. The Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) in 2006 estimated that commuters in Toronto using the HOV facilities on Highways 403 and 404 were saving 14–17 minutes per trip compared to their travel time before the HOV lanes opened. The MTO also estimated that almost 40% of commuters were carpooling on Highway 403 eastbound in the morning peak hour, compared to 14% in 2003, and 37% of commuters were carpooling on Highway 403 westbound in the afternoon peak hour, compared to 22% in 2003. The average rush hour speed on the HOV lanes is , compared to in general-traffic lanes on Highway 403.
Temporary HOV lanes were added to selections of 400-series highways in the Greater Toronto Area for the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games.

===Europe===

As of 2012, there are a few HOV lanes in operation in Europe. The main reason for this is that, in general, European cities have better public transport services and fewer high-capacity multi-lane urban motorways than do the U.S. and Canada. However, at around 1.3 persons per vehicle, average car occupancy is relatively low in most European cities. The emphasis in Europe has been on providing bus lanes and on-street bus priority measures.

The first HOV lane in Europe was opened in the Netherlands in October 1993 and operated until August 1994. Its facility was a barrier-separated HOV 3+ on the A1 near Amsterdam. The facility did not attract enough users to overcome public criticism and was converted to a reversible lane open to general traffic after the judge in a legal test case ruled that Dutch traffic law lacked the concept of a car pool and thus that the principle of equality was violated.

Spain was the next European country to introduce HOV lanes (), when median reversible Bus-VAO lanes were opened in Madrid&#x27;s A-6 in 1995. This facility is Europe&#x27;s oldest HOV facility that is still in operation.

The first HOV facility in the United Kingdom opened in Leeds in 1998. The facility was implemented on A647 road near Leeds as an experimental scheme, but it became permanent. The HOV facility is long and operates as a HOV 2+ facility.

A HOV 3+ facility opened in Linz, Austria, in 1999.

The first HOV lane in Norway was implemented in May 2001 as an HOV 3+ on Elgeseter Street, an undivided four-lane arterial road in Trondheim. This facility was followed by HOV lanes in Oslo and Kristiansand.

===New Zealand and Australia===

The first HOV lane (known as a Transit Lane T2 or T3) in Australia opened in February 1992, located on the Eastern Freeway in Melbourne travelling inbound. In May 2005, T2 Transit lanes were opened on Hoddle Street in Melbourne. As of 2012, there were also T2 and T3 facilities in Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane.

In Auckland, New Zealand, there are several short HOV 2+ and 3+ lanes throughout the region, commonly known as T2 and T3 lanes. There is a T2 transit lane in Tamaki Drive, in a short stretch between Okahu Bay Reserve and downtown Auckland. There are also T2 priority lanes on Auckland&#x27;s Northern, Southern, Northwestern, and Southwestern Motorways. These priority lanes are left-side on-ramp lanes heading towards the motorway, where vehicles with two or more people can bypass the ramp meter signal. Priority lanes can also be used by trucks, buses, and motorcycles, and the priority lanes can be used by carpoolers at any time. Eleven lanes were opened to electric vehicles in a one-year trial from September 2017. There are also several short T2 and T3 facilities in North Shore City operating during rush hours.

===Indonesia===

In Jakarta, HOV 3+ is known as &quot;Three in One&quot; (&quot;Tiga dalam satu&quot;) and was first implemented by governor Sutiyoso. HOV 3+ is implemented on weekdays in existing roads of Sisingamangaraja Road (fast and slow lane), Jalan Jenderal Sudirman (fast and slow lane), Jalan M.H. Thamrin (fast and slow lane), Medan Merdeka Barat Road, Majapahit Road, and sections of Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto. The policy was originally implemented only between 7:00 am and 10:00 am. Since the introduction of Jakarta&#x27;s bus rapid transit in December 2003, the policy was extended to 7:00 am – 10:00 am and 4:00 pm – 7:00 pm. In September 2004, the evening time was changed to 4:30 pm – 7:00 pm. Car jockeys are paid by drivers to ride on vehicles, so that those vehicles would bypass the three in one restriction. On August 30, 2016, an odd–even rationing (&quot;ganjil-genap&quot;) system began to replace &quot;3-in-1&quot; rule, after a successful trial. Odd plate numbers can enter former &quot;3-in-1&quot; areas on odd days and even plate numbers on even ones.

===China===
In Shenzhen, HOV 2+ has been implemented on Binhai Avenue since 25 April 2016. The policy was then extended to 7:30 am – 9:30 am and 5:30 pm – 9:30 pm.

In Chengdu, from January 23, 2017, HOV 2+ has been implemented on Kehua Road South, Kehua Road Middle, and Tianfu Avenue Section 1 and 2, during 7:00 am-9: 00 am and 5:00 pm-7: 00 pm.

In Dalian, an expressway (Northeast Expressway, or Dongbei Expressway) linking old town and new town had one lane in both outbound and inbound directions set to HOV 2+. Starting from September 20, 2017, commuters can opt to drive in HOV lane on Northeast Expressway during the morning peak hours of 06:30-08:30, and evening peak hours of 16:30-19:00. A fine of CNY100 (about USD15) will be enforced for first violators. For a second violation, the fine will double.

==Design and operations==

HOV lanes may be either a single traffic lane within the main roadway with distinctive markings or a separate roadway with one or more traffic lanes either parallel to the general lanes or grade-separated, above or below the general lanes. For example, Interstate 110 in California has four HOV lanes on an upper deck.

HOV bypass lanes are intended to allow carpool traffic, busses and police to bypass areas of regular congestion in many places. An HOV lane may operate as a reversible lane, working in the direction of the dominant traffic flow in both the morning and the afternoon. All lanes of a section of the Interstate 66 in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., are treated as an HOV during the rush hour in the primary direction of flow.

The traffic speed differential between HOV and general-purpose lanes creates a potentially dangerous situation if the HOV lanes are not separated by a barrier. A Texas Transportation Institute study found that HOV lanes lacking barrier separations caused a 50% increase in injury crashes.

==Variants==
===Business access and transit lane===

A business access and transit (BAT) lane is a type of HOV lane that allows for all traffic to enter the lane for a short distance in order to access other streets and business entrances.

===High-occupancy toll lane===

Because some HOV lanes were not utilized to their full capacity, users of low- or single-occupancy vehicles may be permitted to use an HOV lane if they pay a toll. This scheme is known as high-occupancy toll lane (or HOT lanes), and it has been introduced mainly in the United States. The first practical implementation was California&#x27;s formerly private toll 91 Express Lanes, in Orange County, California, in 1995, followed in 1996 by Interstate 15 north of San Diego. According to the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute, by 2012 there were 294 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes and 163 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes under construction in the United States.

Solo drivers are permitted to use the HOV lanes upon payment of a fee that varies based on demand. Tolls change throughout the day according to real-time traffic conditions, which is intended to manage the number of cars in the lanes to maintain good journey times.

Proponents claim that all motorists benefit from HOT lanes, even those who choose not to use them. This argument applies only to projects that increase the total number of lanes. Proponents also claim that HOT lanes provide an incentive to use transit and ridesharing. There has been controversy over this concept, and HOT schemes have been called &quot;Lexus&quot; lanes, as critics see this new pricing scheme as a perk for the rich.

HOT tolls are collected by staffed toll booths, automatic number plate recognition, or electronic toll collection systems. Some systems use RFID transmitters to monitor entry and exiting of the lane and charge drivers depending on demand. Typically, tolls increase as traffic density and congestion within the tolled lanes increase, a policy known as congestion pricing. The goal of this pricing scheme is to minimize traffic congestion within the lanes.

==Qualifying vehicles==
Qualification for HOV status varies by scheme, but the following vehicles may be included:
* Private cars and taxis with a minimum number of human occupants (often two or three), including babies of any age (but only after birth). 
* Single-occupant green vehicles, such as hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, and battery electric vehicles
* Motorcycles - motorcycles are allowed via federal United States HOV lane law (Title 23, Section 166). They can use HOV lanes in Ontario even if they only have a single passenger.
* Buses designed to transport sixteen or more passengers, including the driver
* Public utility vehicles when responding to emergency calls
* Bicycles
* Police are allowed to use the HOV lanes in Ontario.

New York City HOV lane codes prior to 2008 did not allow motorcycles leading to ticketing of motorcycle drivers and complaints from the American Motorcyclist Association, but have since been revised to comply with the federal regulations listed above.

In some jurisdictions such as Ontario, Canada, taxicabs and airport limousines are allowed to use HOV lanes even when no passenger is present because that vehicle &quot;will be able return to duty faster after dropping off a fare or arrive sooner to pick up a fare, thereby moving more people to their destinations in fewer vehicles&quot;.

In Virginia, the San Francisco Bay Area, Houston, and other HOV lane locations, commuters form sluglines where drivers pick up one or more passengers from a designated &quot;casual carpool&quot; or &quot;slug lines&quot; to drive on HOV lanes; the driver pulls over near the sluglines and shouts out their destination, and people in the line going to that destination enter the car on a first-come, first-served basis.
==Compliance, enforcement, and avoidance==

Fines are usually imposed on drivers of non-qualifying vehicles who use the lanes.

Following the introduction of HOVs, some drivers placed inflatable dolls in the passenger seat, a practice that persists today, even though it is now illegal. Cameras that can distinguish between humans and mannequins or dolls were tested in the United Kingdom in 2005.

In the United States, law enforcement officials have documented a variety of methods used by drivers in attempts to circumvent HOV occupancy rules:
*Placing store mannequins, blow-up dolls, kickboxing dummies, or cardboard cut-outs in the passenger seat;
*Taping styrofoam wig stands with wigs or balloons with faces drawn on them to the passenger seat headrest; 
*Buckling the passenger-side seat belt and pretending to talk to someone reclining in that seat;
*Tinting the front windshield and/or lowering the passenger side visor in an effort to obstruct the view into the passenger seat;
*Covering an empty infant seat with a blanket and/or placing a doll in it;
*Strapping dogs, cats, or other pets into the passenger seat.

In early 2006, an Arizona woman asserted that she had been improperly ticketed for using the HOV lane because the unborn child she was carrying in her womb justified her use of the lane, while noting that Arizona traffic laws do not define what constitutes a person. However, a judge subsequently ruled that to qualify as an &quot;individual&quot; under Arizona traffic laws, the individual must occupy a &quot;separate and distinct&quot; space in a vehicle. Likewise, in California, in order to use HOV lanes, there must be two (or, if posted, three) separate individuals occupying seats in a vehicle, and an unborn child does not count towards this requirement.

In 2009 and 2010 it was found that non-compliance rates on HOV lanes in Brisbane, Australia, were approaching 90%. Enhanced enforcement led to increased compliance, average bus journey times dropped by about 19%, and total person throughput increased by 12%.

In February 2010, a 61-year-old woman tried to pass off a life-sized mannequin as a passenger in order to use the HOV lane in New York State. A police officer on a routine HOV patrol became suspicious when he noticed that the so-called passenger was wearing sunglasses and using the visor on a cloudy morning. When the officer approached the vehicle, he discovered that the &quot;passenger&quot; was, in fact, a mannequin wearing lipstick, designer shades, a full-length wig, and a blue sweater. The driver was issued a traffic ticket for using the HOV lane without a human passenger, which carries a fine of $135 in 2010 and two points on a driver&#x27;s license.

In January 2013, a motorist tried to claim that the Articles of Incorporation of his business, which had been placed unbuckled on the passenger’s seat, constituted a person, citing the principle of corporate personhood and California&#x27;s state Vehicle Code, which defines a person as &quot;natural persons and corporations&quot;. This argument was rejected in traffic court, where the presiding judge commented, &quot;Common sense says carrying a sheaf of papers in the front seat does not relieve traffic congestion.&quot;

In March 2015, a motorist tried to use a cardboard cutout of actor Jonathan Goldsmith to access an HOV lane in Fife, Washington. The officer noted that other drivers had used sleeping bags in earlier attempts to access the HOV lane.

In July 2022, a pregnant woman in Texas argued that her fetus counted as a passenger for the purpose of using the HOV lane following the &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; decision and Texas law subsequently considering fetuses people.

==Effectiveness==
According to 2009 data from the U.S. census, 76% drive to work alone and only 10% rideshare. For suburban commuters working in a city, the solo driving rate is 82%.

Some underused HOV lanes in several states have been converted to high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT), which offer solo drivers access to HOV lanes after paying a toll.

HOV lanes are also an effective way to manage traffic after natural disasters, as seen in New York City after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. At the time Mayor Bloomberg banned passenger cars with fewer than three occupants from entering Manhattan. The restriction affected all bridges and tunnels entering the city except the George Washington Bridge.

==Criticism==
Critics have argued that HOV lanes are underused. It is unclear whether HOV lanes are sufficiently used to compensate for delays in the other mixed-use lanes.

The situations have caused social problems in Indonesia, where some people become &quot;car jockey&quot;, people who make their living by offering drivers to fill their car in order to meet the occupancy limit. Reportedly, the situation caused people stay in unemployment for doing so, increased congestion, and let parents profit from their babies.

<doc id="55467" wikidata="Q527462" url="?curid=55467" title="DeWitt Clinton">
<text>DeWitt Clinton (March 2, 1769February 11, 1828) was an American politician and naturalist. He served as a United States senator, as the mayor of New York City, and as the sixth governor of New York. In the last capacity, he was largely responsible for the construction of the Erie Canal. Clinton was a major candidate for the American presidency in the election of 1812, challenging incumbent James Madison.

A nephew of two-term U.S. vice president and New York governor George Clinton, DeWitt Clinton was his uncle&#x27;s secretary before launching his own political career. As a Democratic-Republican, Clinton won election to the New York State Legislature in 1798 before briefly serving as a U.S. Senator. Returning to New York, Clinton served three terms as the appointed Mayor of New York City and the lieutenant governor of New York State. In the 1812 presidential election, Clinton won support from the Federalists as well as from a group of Democratic-Republicans who were dissatisfied with Madison. Though Madison won re-election, Clinton carried most of the Northeastern United States and fared significantly better than the previous two Federalist-supported tickets. After the presidential election, Clinton continued to be affiliated with the Democratic-Republican Party.

Clinton was governor of New York from 1817 to 1822 and from 1825 to 1828, and presided over the construction of the Erie Canal. Clinton believed that infrastructure improvements could transform American life, drive economic growth, and encourage political participation. He heavily influenced the development of infrastructure both in New York State and in the United States as a whole.

==Early life==
Clinton was born on March 2, 1769, the second son born to Major-General James Clinton and his wife Mary De Witt (1737–1795), who was a descendant of the Dutch patrician De Witt family. He was born in Little Britain, New York, which today is a hamlet in the western part of New Windsor. He attended Kingston Academy and began his college studies at the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University) before transferring to King&#x27;s College (which was renamed Columbia College while he was a student there; Clinton was in the first class to graduate under the school&#x27;s new name.) He was the brother of U.S. Representative George Clinton Jr., the half-brother of U.S. Representative James G. Clinton, and the cousin of Simeon De Witt. He became the secretary to his uncle George Clinton, who was then governor of New York. Soon afterwards he became a member of the Democratic-Republican Party.

==Political career==
===Early career===
Clinton was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1798, and of the New York State Senate (representing its Southern District) in 1798–1802 and 1806–1811 He was a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1801. 

In 1801, his uncle George Clinton appointed him to head the Council of Appointments, which held the power under the state constitution to appoint thousands of public positions, including sheriffs and the mayor of New York City. He would serve on the committee from 1801 to 1802 and again from 1806 to 1807. As chair of the council, Clinton controlled patronage throughout the state. Because the council was overwhelmingly Republican and loyal to the Clintons, De Witt suddenly became the most powerful politician in the state. He used his power to deny supporters of Aaron Burr and members of the Tammany Society key roles.

In 1802, he used his authority as a director of the Manhattan Company, the leading Republican bank in the state, to force the withdrawal of Burr and his key supporter John Swartwout. Swartwout accused Clinton of destroying Burr to advance his own political career; in response, Clinton called Swartwout &quot;a liar, a scoundrel and a villain.&quot; Swartwout challenged Clinton to a duel in New Jersey (where duelling was legal), in which Clinton wounded Swartwout.

The New York State legislature elected him to fill New York&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat, which had been left vacant by the resignation of John Armstrong Jr.; he served in that capacity from February 9, 1802, to November 4, 1803. He resigned due to unhappiness with his living conditions in the newly built city of Washington, DC; next, he was appointed the mayor of New York City.

===Mayor of New York City===
He served as mayor of New York from 1803 to 1807, 1808 to 1810, and 1811 to 1815. He organized the New-York Historical Society in 1804 and was its president, and he was a leader in launching the Erie Canal. He also helped to reorganize the American Academy of the Fine Arts in 1808 and served as its president between 1813 and 1817. He was a regent of the University of the State of New York from 1808 to 1825. Clinton was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814 and was its vice president from 1821 to 1828. In 1816, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

===Lieutenant Governor of New York===
In 1811, the death of John Broome left a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor of New York. In a special election, Clinton defeated the Federalist Nicholas Fish and the Tammany Hall candidate Marinus Willett to become lieutenant governor until the end of the term in June 1813.

===Presidential campaign===
Clinton&#x27;s uncle, George Clinton, had attempted to challenge James Madison for the presidency in 1808 but was chosen as the party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee instead. In 1812, after George Clinton&#x27;s death, the elder Clinton&#x27;s supporters gravitated towards DeWitt Clinton. Clinton ran for president as a candidate both for the Federalist Party and for a small group of antiwar Democratic-Republicans. In the close election of 1812, Clinton was defeated by President Madison. Clinton received 89 electoral votes to Madison&#x27;s 128. It was the strongest showing of any Federalist candidate for the U.S. presidency since 1800, and a change in the votes of one or two states would have given Clinton the victory.

===Governor of New York===

After the resignation of Daniel D. Tompkins, who had been elected vice president, he won a special gubernatorial election in which he was the only candidate; 1,479 votes were cast for Peter Buell Porter against Clinton&#x27;s 43,310, because the Tammany organization, which fiercely hated Clinton, had printed ballots with Porter&#x27;s name on them and distributed them among the Tammany followers in New York City. On July 1, 1817, Clinton took office as governor of New York. He was re-elected in 1820, defeating Vice President Tompkins in a narrow race—DeWitt Clinton received 47,447 votes, as opposed to Tompkins&#x27;s 45,900—and served until December 31, 1822.

During his second term, the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 shortened the gubernatorial term to two years and moved the beginning of the term from July 1 to January 1, which cut off the last six months of his three-year term. The gubernatorial election was also moved from April to November, but Clinton was not renominated by his party to run for re-election in November 1822. Even so, he kept his post as president of the Erie Canal Commission. In April 1824, most of his political opponents, the Bucktails, voted in the New York State legislature for his removal from the Canal Commission, which caused such a wave of indignation among the electorate that he was nominated for governor by the People&#x27;s Party and was re-elected governor, defeating the official candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party, his fellow Canal Commissioner Samuel Young. He served another two terms until his sudden death in office.

===Freemasonry===
Clinton was a York Rite Freemason. He was initiated in the &quot;Holland&quot; Lodge No. 16 (now No 8), NY on September 3, 1790, and, in 1806, he was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New York. Clinton was essential in establishing the Grand Encampment of Knights Templar in the United States and served as its first, second, and third grand master from 1816 to 1828. He retained the title until his death in 1828.

In 1826, the William Morgan Affair occurred in Batavia. Morgan, who threatened to publish an exposé of the rituals of Freemasonry, disappeared and was apparently kidnapped and supposedly murdered by Masons. Clinton issued three proclamations, each increasing the reward for information and conviction of the perpetrators until it reached $2,000. Clinton&#x27;s proclamations had no effect, however, and the Masonic fraternity underwent a period of severe decline in many regions of the United States because of criticism set off by the scandal.

The Grand Lodge of New York has established the DeWitt Clinton Award, which recognizes distinguished or outstanding community service by non-Masonic organizations or individuals whose actions exemplify a shared concern for the well-being of Mankind and a belief in the worldwide brotherhood of Man.

==Erie Canal==

From 1810 to 1824, Clinton was a member of the Erie Canal Commission. He was among its first members, who were appointed in 1810 and planned and surveyed the route to be taken.

As governor, Clinton was largely responsible for the construction of the Erie Canal. He was persuaded by Canal proponent Jesse Hawley to support construction of a canal from the eastern shore of Lake Erie to the upper Hudson River. Many thought the project to be impracticable, and opponents mocked it as &quot;Clinton&#x27;s Folly&quot; and &quot;DeWitt&#x27;s Ditch&quot;. But in 1817, he persuaded the legislature to appropriate $7 million for its construction.

When the canal was finished in 1825, Clinton opened it and traveled in the packet boat &quot;Seneca Chief&quot; along the canal to Buffalo. After riding from the mouth of Lake Erie to New York City, he emptied two casks of water from Lake Erie into New York Harbor to celebrate the first connection of waters from the East with waters from the West. The canal was an immense success, carrying huge numbers of passengers and a huge amount of freight traffic. The cost of moving freight between Buffalo and Albany fell from $100 to $10 per ton, and the state was able to quickly recoup the funds that it had spent on the project by collecting tolls along the canal. The completion of the canal brought about a significant shift in public opinion about Clinton: he was now hailed for having completed the canal.

That change in public opinion was reflected in the newspapers of the time. They had previously been filled with harsh criticisms of Clinton and the canal, but now celebrated his accomplishment. For example, an article in the &quot;New Hampshire Sentinel&quot; began: &quot;The efforts of Gov. Clinton to advance the best interest of the State over which he presides are very generally acknowledged both by his constituents and the public abroad. His exertions in favor of the great canal have identified his name with that noble enterprise, and he will be remembered while its benefits are experienced&quot; It ended, &quot;Yield credit to Clinton, and hail him by name&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
Together with financier Thomas Eddy, he was a director of New York&#x27;s earliest savings bank established to serve laborers and the poor, The Bank for Savings in the City of New-York.

== Personal life ==

Clinton was married twice. On February 13, 1796, he married Maria Franklin, daughter of the prominent New York Quaker merchant Walter Franklin and descendant of John Bowne and Elizabeth Fones. With her, he had ten children, and four sons and three daughters had survived at the time of her death in 1818. Among his children with Franklin was George William Clinton, who served as mayor of Buffalo, New York from 1842 to 1843.

On May 8, 1819, Clinton married Catharine Jones, the daughter of a New York physician, Thomas Jones and his wife, Margaret (née Livingston) Jones (a daughter of Edward Livingston). Catharine&#x27;s sister, Mary (née Jones) Gelston, was the wife of Deacon Maltby Gelston of Southampton, and the mother of David Gelston, Collector of the Port of New York. Catharine outlived her husband.

In 1813, Clinton became a hereditary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati in succession to his brother, Lieutenant Alexander Clinton, who was an original member of the society. In that same year, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

When Clinton died suddenly of heart failure in Albany on February 11, 1828, he left his family in poor financial condition. While he was a fine administrator in government, he had handled his own financial affairs rather poorly. As a result, the Clinton family was badly in debt and had no means of support after the governor&#x27;s death. One creditor alone put in a claim for $6,000. Fearing that he might not get his money, the creditor obtained a judgment that resulted in a public sale of most of the Clinton family possessions. Enough money was realized from the sale of the property to satisfy the judgment, but nothing was left to help the Clinton family through the difficult years ahead. The governor received the grandest of state funerals, but when it was all over, the family had no place to bury him. His widow was completely without funds to purchase a suitable grave site. As a result, Clinton&#x27;s remains were placed in the family vault of Dr. Samuel Stringer (1735–1817), an old friend and fellow Mason from Albany, in the old Swan Street Cemetery.

Sixteen years later, enough money was collected to provide a suitable burial. On June 21, 1844, a newspaper in Albany printed this small announcement: &quot;The remains of DeWitt Clinton, which had been deposited in the cemetery in Swan Street, were removed to New York for interment under a monument created by the family.&quot; Clinton was reinterred at the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

==Legacy==

Clinton&#x27;s accomplishments as a leader in civic and state affairs included improving the New York public school system, encouraging steam navigation, and modifying the laws governing criminals and debtors. The 1831 &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot; locomotive was named in his honor. The community of Whitestone, New York was for several decades after his death known as Clintonville, but reverted to its traditional name; however, the governor is memorialized by Clintonville Street, a major local road.

*An engraved portrait of Clinton appeared on the Legal Tender (United States Note) issue of 1880 in the $1,000.00 denomination. An illustrated example is on the website of Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;American Currency Exhibit&quot;.
*In 1926 the DeWitt Clinton Professorship of American History was established at Columbia University; the first to hold the chair was Evarts Boutell Greene.
* DeWitt Clinton became a focus of public attention related to the Erie Canal&#x27;s bicentennial, which began in 2017 (the 200th anniversary of the original canal&#x27;s groundbreaking) and will continue through 2025 (the 200th anniversary of the canal&#x27;s opening). In a New York City event on July 4, 2017, actor Kyle Jenks read Clinton&#x27;s 1815 canal manifesto on the steps of Federal Hall in lower Manhattan. In December 2017, the Museum of the City of New York completed a renovation of a statue of Clinton, along with one of Alexander Hamilton, located on the museum&#x27;s exterior. Also that year, a book featuring descendants of DeWitt Clinton exploring ruins of the original canal, titled &quot;In DeWitt&#x27;s Footsteps&quot;, was published by journalist Kenneth Silber.
* March 2, 2019 was the 250th anniversary, or semiquincentennial, of DeWitt Clinton&#x27;s birth. The milestone was marked by events at the Erie Canal Museum in Syracuse and the Buffalo Maritime Center.
* Following his New York Governorship, &quot;DeWitt&quot; became a popular given name - see DeWitt (name).
* The City of DeWitt, Michigan is named for Clinton. 
* Both the town and township of Clinton, New Jersey are named after him.
* The township of Clinton, Indiana is named after him.
* The city of Clinton, Louisiana in East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana founded in 1824 is named after him. 
* &quot;Clintonia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants described by Rafinesque in 1818, was named in honor of DeWitt Clinton.

His portrait appears on many tobacco tax stamps of the late 1800s to early 1900s.

<doc id="55469" wikidata="Q278208" url="?curid=55469" title="Catch-22">
<text>Catch-22 is a satirical war novel by American author Joseph Heller. It was his debut novel. He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961. Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century, it uses a distinctive non-chronological third-person omniscient narration, describing events from the points of view of different characters. The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot.

The novel is set during World War II, from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows the life of antihero Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th US Army Air Squadron is based on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea west of the Italian mainland, although it also includes episodes from basic training at Lowry Field in Colorado and Air Corps training at Santa Ana Army Air Base in California. The novel examines the absurdity of war and military life through the experiences of Yossarian and his cohorts, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home.

The book was made into a film adaptation in 1970, directed by Mike Nichols, and a miniseries in 2019, produced by George Clooney. In 1994, Heller published a sequel to the novel entitled &quot;Closing Time&quot;.

== Synopsis ==

The main character, Yossarian, is introduced in the setting of a military hospital where he has retreated under the guise of a chronic liver condition to avoid flying further combat missions since he has grown disillusioned with the war effort and distrustful of his commanding officers. Throughout the novel, the commanding officers show extreme disregard for the lives of their troops and are all too willing to sacrifice their men to further their own ends. Especially, Colonel Cathcart volunteers his unit to fly dangerous missions and forces his men to fly more combat missions than any other unit, constantly raising the number of missions necessary to complete a tour of duty so that the men can never return home, because he wishes to be seen as brave by his superiors even though he has only ever flown a single combat mission. After flying forty-four combat missions, Yossarian has become traumatized by aerial combat and witnessing the deaths of his friends; he is terrified of being killed in action during each combat mission, but still succeeds in flying twenty-seven more missions over the course of the novel, totaling seventy-one by the end. As the novel progresses, Yossarian&#x27;s moral character and courage emerge more clearly, in contrast to his seeming selfishness and cowardice when first introduced. He is shown to be an honest, loyal, and able flyer who has been pushed to desperation by the selfishness and cowardice of the authorities responsible for him, especially doctors and military leaders.

The development of the novel can be split into sections:

* The first (chapters 1–11) broadly follows the story fragmented between characters, but in a single chronological time in 1944. 
* The second (chapters 12–20) flashes back to focus primarily on the &quot;Great Big Siege of Bologna&quot; before once again jumping to the third part.
* The third is the chronological present of 1944 (chapter 21–25). 
* The fourth (chapters 26–28) flashes back to the origins and growth of Milo&#x27;s syndicate.
* The fifth part (chapter 28–32) returning again to the narrative present and maintaining the tone of the previous four. 
* The sixth and final part (chapter 32 and on) remains in the story&#x27;s present, but takes a much darker turn and emphasizes the darkness and brutality of war and life in general.

For most of the book, the reader is cushioned from directly experiencing the full horror of war, but the existence of these horrors is implied by the extreme trauma and fear that afflicts the airmen. In the final section, these events are laid bare. The horror begins with a pointless attack on an undefended Italian mountain village, with the succeeding chapters incorporating depictions of despair (Doc Daneeka and the chaplain), disappearance in combat (Orr and Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) and death of most of Yossarian&#x27;s friends (Nately, McWatt, Kid Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe), culminating in the horrors of Chapter 39, in particular Aarfy&#x27;s rape and murder of the innocent young woman Michaela. In Chapter 41 the full details of the death of Snowden are finally revealed.

Nevertheless, the novel ends on an upbeat note with Yossarian learning of Orr&#x27;s miraculous escape to Sweden and Yossarian&#x27;s pledge to follow him there.

== Style ==
Many events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about each event from each iteration, with the new information often completing a joke, the setup of which was told several chapters previously. The narrative&#x27;s events are out of sequence, but events are referred to as if the reader is already familiar with them so that the reader must ultimately piece together a timeline of events. Specific words, phrases, and questions are also repeated frequently, generally to comic effect.

Much of Heller&#x27;s prose in &quot;Catch-22&quot; is circular and repetitive, exemplifying in its form the structure of a Catch-22. Circular reasoning is widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions. Heller revels in paradox. For example: &quot;The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him,&quot; and &quot;The case against Clevinger was open and shut. The only thing missing was something to charge him with.&quot; This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book. This style is also recognizable regarding how exactly Clevinger&#x27;s trial would be executed by Lieutenant Scheisskopf: &quot;As a member of the Action Board, Lieutenant Scheisskopf was one of the judges who would weigh the merits of the case against Clevenger as presented by the prosecutor. Lieutenant Scheisskopf was also the prosecutor. Clevinger had an officer defending him. The officer defending him was Lieutenant Scheisskopf.&quot;

While a few characters are most prominent, especially Yossarian and the Chaplain, the majority of named characters are described in detail with fleshed out or multidimensional personas to the extent that there are few if any &quot;minor characters&quot;. There are no traditional heroes in the novel, reflecting the underlying commentary that war has no heroes, only victims.

Although its nonchronological structure may at first seem random, &quot;Catch-22&quot; is highly structured. It is founded on a structure of free association; ideas run into one another through seemingly random connections. For example, Chapter 1, titled &quot;The Texan&quot;, ends with &quot;everybody but the CID man, who had caught a cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia.&quot; Chapter 2, titled &quot;Clevinger&quot;, begins with &quot;In a way, the CID man was pretty lucky because outside the hospital the war was still going on.&quot; The CID man connects the two chapters like a free association bridge and eventually Chapter 2 flows from the CID man to Clevinger through more free association links.

As Heller utilizes an episodic structure for most of the novel, many chapters may appear to be a disjointed series of events with little or no connection with each other. However, individual chapters often deal with thematically unique ideas, such as Chapter 11 (“Captain Black”) which parodies Red Scare-era McCarthyism, and Chapter 18 (“The Soldier Who Saw Everything Twice”) which explores theological concepts of mortality.

== Themes ==

=== Paradox ===
Yossarian comes to fear his commanding officers more than he fears the Germans attempting to shoot him down and he feels that &quot;they&quot; are &quot;out to get him.&quot; The reason Yossarian fears his commanders more than the enemy is that as he flies more missions, Colonel Cathcart increases the number of required combat missions before a soldier may return home; he reaches the magic number only to have it retroactively raised. He comes to despair of ever getting home and is greatly relieved when he is sent to the hospital for a condition that is almost jaundice. In Yossarian&#x27;s words:

=== Tragedy and farce ===
Much of the farce in the novel is fueled by intentional and unintentional miscommunication, occasionally leading to tragic consequences. For example, Cathcart&#x27;s desire to become a general is thwarted by ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen sabotaging his correspondence. Major Major&#x27;s and Yossarian&#x27;s mis-censoring of correspondence is blamed on the Chaplain, who is threatened with imprisonment as a result.

=== Theodicy ===
Yossarian questions the idea that God is all-powerful, all-good, and all knowing. The narrator seems to believe that God, if not evil, is incompetent. In chapter 18, Yossarian states that he &quot;believes in the God he doesn&#x27;t believe in&quot;, this version of God having created Hitler, the war, and all the failures of human life and society, as exemplified in the following passage:&quot;And don&#x27;t tell me God works in mysterious ways&quot;, Yossarian continued, hurtling over her objections. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing so mysterious about it. He&#x27;s not working at all. He&#x27;s playing or else He&#x27;s forgotten all about us. That&#x27;s the kind of God you people talk about – a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did he ever create pain? … Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! [to warn us of danger] Why couldn&#x27;t He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of His celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person&#x27;s forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn&#x27;t He? … What a colossal, immortal blunderer! When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly little mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. …&quot;Later Heller writes of Yossarian wandering through a war-torn Italian city (Chapter 39): &quot;Yossarian quickened his pace to get away, almost ran. The night was filled with horrors, and he thought he knew how Christ must have felt as he walked through the world, like a psychiatrist through a ward full of nuts, like a victim through a prison full of thieves. What a welcome sight a leper must have been. At the next corner a man was beating a small boy brutally in the midst of an immobile crowd of adult spectators who made no effort to intervene ...&quot;

=== Military-industrial complex ===
While the military&#x27;s enemies are Germans, none appear in the story as enemy combatants. This ironic situation is epitomized in the single appearance of German personnel in the novel, who act as pilots employed by the squadron&#x27;s mess officer, Milo Minderbinder, to bomb the American encampment on Pianosa. This predicament indicates a tension between traditional motives for violence and the modern economic machine, which seems to generate violence simply as another means to profit, quite independent of geographical or ideological constraints which creates a military–industrial complex. Heller emphasizes the danger of profit-seeking by portraying Milo without &quot;evil intent&quot;. Milo&#x27;s actions are portrayed as the result of greed, not malice.

== Characters ==
The novel has over 50 named characters, many of whom have titular chapters dedicated to expanding on their personalities or motivations.

== Influences ==
Heller wanted to be a writer from an early age. His experiences as a bombardier during World War II inspired &quot;Catch-22&quot;; Heller later said that he &quot;never had a bad officer&quot;. In a 1977 essay on &quot;Catch-22&quot;, Heller stated that the &quot;antiwar and antigovernment feelings in the book&quot; were a product of the Korean War and the 1950s rather than World War II itself. Heller&#x27;s criticisms are not intended for World War II but for the Cold War and McCarthyism.

The influence of the 1950s on &quot;Catch-22&quot; is evident through Heller&#x27;s extensive use of anachronism. Though the novel is ostensibly set in World War II, Heller intentionally included anachronisms like loyalty oaths and computers (IBM machines) to situate the novel in the context of the 1950s. Many of the characters are based on or connected to individuals from the 1950s:
* Milo Minderbinder&#x27;s maxim &quot;What&#x27;s good for M&amp;M Enterprises is good for the country&quot; alludes to the former president of General Motors Charles Erwin Wilson&#x27;s 1953 statement before the Senate: &quot;What&#x27;s good for General Motors is good for the country.&quot;
* The question of &quot;Who promoted Major Major?&quot; alludes to Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s questioning of the promotion of Major Peress, an army dentist who refused to sign loyalty oaths.

Czech writer Arnošt Lustig recounts in his book &quot;3x18&quot; that Joseph Heller told him that he would never have written &quot;Catch-22&quot; had he not first read &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; by Jaroslav Hašek.

In 1998, some critics raised the possibility that Heller&#x27;s book had questionable similarities to Louis Falstein&#x27;s 1950 novel, &quot;Face of a Hero&quot;. Falstein never raised the issue between &quot;Catch-22&quot; publication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to have been aware of the obscure novel. Heller said that the novel had been influenced by Céline, Waugh and Nabokov. Many of the similarities have been stated to be attributable to the authors&#x27; experiences, both having served as U.S. Army Air Forces aircrew in Italy in World War II. However, their themes and styles are different.

== Concept ==
A &quot;Catch-22&quot; is &quot;a problem for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule&quot;. For example, losing something is typically a conventional problem; to solve it, one looks for the lost item until one finds it. But if the thing lost is one&#x27;s glasses, one cannot see to look for them – a Catch-22. The term &quot;Catch-22&quot; is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no-win or absurd situation.

In the book, Catch-22 is a military rule typifying bureaucratic operation and reasoning. The rule is not stated in a precise form, but the principal example in the book fits the definition above: If one is crazy, one does not have to fly missions; and one must be crazy to fly. But one has to apply to be excused, and applying demonstrates that one is not crazy. As a result, one must continue flying, either not applying to be excused, or applying and being refused. The narrator explains:

There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one&#x27;s safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn&#x27;t, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn&#x27;t have to, but if he didn&#x27;t want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5)

Other forms of Catch-22 are invoked throughout the novel to justify various bureaucratic actions. At one point, victims of harassment by military police quote the MPs&#x27; explanation of one of Catch-22&#x27;s provisions: &quot;Catch-22 states that agents enforcing Catch-22 need not prove that Catch-22 actually contains whatever provision the accused violator is accused of violating.&quot; Another character explains: &quot;Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can&#x27;t stop them from doing.&quot;

Yossarian comes to realize that Catch-22 does not actually exist, but because the powers that be claim it does, and the world believes it does, it nevertheless has potent effects. Indeed, because it does not exist, there is no way it can be repealed, undone, overthrown, or denounced. The combination of force with specious and spurious legalistic justification is one of the book&#x27;s primary motifs.

The motif of bureaucratic absurdity is further explored in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Closing Time&quot;, Heller&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Catch-22&quot;. This darker, slower-paced, apocalyptic novel explores the pre- and post-war lives of some of the major characters in &quot;Catch-22&quot;, with particular emphasis on the relationship between Yossarian and tail gunner Sammy Singer.

== Literary allusions ==
&quot;Catch-22&quot; contains allusions to many works of literature. Howard Jacobson, in his 2004 introduction to the Vintage Classics publication, wrote that the novel was &quot;positioned teasingly ... between literature and literature&#x27;s opposites – between Shakespeare and Rabelais and Dickens and Dostoevsky and Gogol and Céline and the Absurdists and of course Kafka on the one hand, and on the other vaudeville and slapstick and Bilko and Abbott and Costello and Tom and Jerry and the Goons (if Heller had ever heard of the Goons).&quot;
One critic argues that it is Kafka&#x27;s influence that can be seen most strongly in the novel: &quot;Like Kafka&#x27;s heroes, Yossarian is riddled with anxiety and caught in an inexorable nightmare – in his case created by Colonel Cathcart and the inevitability of his raising the number of missions he has to fly.&quot;

== Historical context ==

The idea for &quot;Catch-22&quot; was based on Joseph Heller&#x27;s personal experience in World War II. The feelings that Yossarian and the other bomber crew felt were taken directly from problems he suffered while on duty. Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944. Heller was able to make it out of the war, but it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it. For this reason, the book contains references to post World War II phenomena like IBM computers and loyalty oaths. The war experience turned Heller into a &quot;tortured, funny, deeply peculiar human being&quot;.

After publication in 1961, &quot;Catch-22&quot; became very popular among teenagers at the time. &quot;Catch-22&quot; seemed to embody the feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of &quot;Catch-22&quot;. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States. On October 26, 1986, professor and author John W. Aldridge wrote a piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publishing of &quot;Catch-22&quot;. He commented that Heller&#x27;s book presaged the chaos in the world that was to come:

The comic fable that ends in horror has become more and more clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of the world in which we live and hope to survive.

== Title ==

The title refers to a fictional bureaucratic stipulation that embodies illogical and immoral reasoning. The idea being that if one pleads insanity to stop flying missions with a high mortality rate, one is in fact sane; however, one must be insane to keep flying those exact missions. The opening chapter of the novel was first published, in 1955, by &quot;New World Writing&quot; as &quot;Catch-18&quot;, but Heller&#x27;s agent, Candida Donadio, asked him to change the title, to avert its confusion with Leon Uris&#x27;s recently published &quot;Mila 18&quot;. A reference was made to this nomenclatural history in the 2023 Netflix show &quot;Beef&quot;. The implications in Judaism of the number 18 – which refers to &quot;chai&quot;, meaning &quot;alive&quot;, in Gematria – were relevant to Heller&#x27;s somewhat greater emphasis on Jewish themes in early drafts of his novel. Heller&#x27;s daughter Erica wrote that the Simon &amp; Schuster editor, Robert Gottlieb, was the person who came up with the number 22, and Gottlieb himself stated that he did in the documentary &quot;Turn Every Page: The Adventures of Robert Caro and Robert Gottlieb.&quot;

Parallels among a number of character exchanges in the novel suggested the doubled-one title of &quot;Catch-11&quot;, but the 1960 release of &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; eliminated that. &quot;Catch-17&quot; was rejected so as not to be confused with the World War II film &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, as was &quot;Catch-14&quot;, apparently because the publisher did not believe that 14 was a &quot;funny number&quot;. Eventually, the title came to be &quot;Catch-22&quot;, which, like 11, has a duplicated digit, with the 2 also referring to a number of &quot;déjà vu&quot;-like events common in the novel.

== Publication and movie rights ==
&quot;Catch-22&quot; was sold to Simon &amp; Schuster, where it had been championed by editor Robert Gottlieb, who, along with Nina Bourne, edited and oversaw the marketing of the book. Gottlieb was a strong advocate for the book along with Peter Schwed and Justin Kaplan. Henry Simon, a vice president at Simon &amp; Schuster, found it repetitive and offensive. The editorial board decided to contract the book when Heller agreed to revisions; he signed for . 

Officially published on October 10, 1961, the hardcover sold for $5.95. The book was not a best-seller in hardcover in the United States. Though twelve thousand copies were sold by Thanksgiving, it never entered &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. It received good notices and was nominated for the National Book Award in March 1962, though Walker Percy&#x27;s &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; won. &quot;Catch-22&quot; went through four printings in hardcover but sold well on only the East Coast. The book never established itself nationally until it was published in paperback for 75 cents.

Upon publication in Great Britain, the book became the No. 1 best-seller. Don Fine of Dell Paperbacks bought the paperback reprint rights to &quot;Catch-22&quot; for $32,000. Between the paperback&#x27;s release in September 1962 and April 1963, it sold 1.1 million copies.

In August 1962, Donadio brokered the sale of movie rights to Columbia Pictures for $100,000 plus $25,000 to write a treatment or a first draft of a screenplay.

== Reception ==
The initial reviews of the book ranged from very positive to very negative. There were positive reviews from &quot;The Nation&quot; (&quot;the best novel to come out in years&quot;), the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; (&quot;A wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller-coaster of a book&quot;) and &quot;The New York Times&quot; (&quot;A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights&quot;). On the other hand, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; disliked it (&quot;doesn&#x27;t even seem to be written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper&quot;, &quot;what remains is a debris of sour jokes&quot;), and a second review from the &quot;New York Times&quot; also disliked it (&quot;repetitive and monotonous. Or one can say that it is too short because none of its many interesting characters and actions is given enough play to become a controlling interest&quot;). One commentator of &quot;Catch-22&quot; recognized that &quot;many early audiences liked the book for just the same reasons that caused others to hate it&quot;. The book eventually gained a cult following, especially among teenagers and college students. Heller later remarked that in 1962, after appearing on the &quot;Today&quot; show he went out drinking with the host at the time, John Chancellor, who handed him stickers that Chancellor had got privately printed reading &quot;YOSSARIAN LIVES&quot;. Heller also said that Chancellor had been secretly putting them on the walls of the corridors and executive bathrooms in the NBC building.

Although the novel won no awards upon release, it has remained in print and is seen as one of the most significant American novels of the 20th century. Scholar and fellow World War II veteran Hugh Nibley said it was the most accurate book he ever read about the military. over ten million copies have been sold.

Although he continued writing, including a sequel novel &quot;Closing Time&quot;, Heller&#x27;s later works were inevitably overshadowed by the success of &quot;Catch-22&quot;. When asked by critics why he had never managed to write another novel as good as his first, Heller would retort with a smile, &quot;Who has?&quot;

=== Challenges ===
&quot;Catch-22&quot; has landed on the list of the American Library Association&#x27;s banned and challenged classics.

In 1972, the school board in Strongsville, Ohio, removed &quot;Catch-22&quot;, as well as two books by Kurt Vonnegut, from school libraries and the curriculum. Five families sued the school board. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claim, stating that school boards had the right to control the curriculum. The decision was overturned on appeal in 1976. The court wrote, &quot;A library is a storehouse of knowledge. Here we are concerned with the right of students to receive information which they and their teachers desire them to have.&quot; In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court employed a similar rationale in its decision in &quot;Island Trees School District v. Pico&quot; on the removal of library books.

Because the book refers to some women as &quot;whores&quot;, it was challenged at the Dallas, Texas, Independent School District (1974) and Snoqualmie, Washington (1979).

<text>Steuben County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 93,584. Its county seat is Bath. Its name is in honor of Baron von Steuben, a Prussian general who fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War, though it is not pronounced the same (). The county is part of the Southern Tier region of the state.

Steuben County comprises the Corning, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Elmira-Corning, NY Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

Ontario County was established in 1789 to govern lands the state of New York had acquired in the Phelps and Gorham Purchase; at the time it covered the entirety of Western New York. Steuben County, much larger than today, was split off from Ontario County on March 8, 1796. In 1823 a portion of Steuben County was combined with a portion of Ontario County to form Yates County. Steuben County was further reduced in size on April 17, 1854, when a portion was combined with portions of Chemung and Tompkins counties to form Schuyler County.

In its earliest years Steuben County was demographically and geographically linked to the Susquehanna River basin in Pennsylvania, leading to the port of Baltimore. The Canisteo River, navigable as far as Arkport, emptied into the Chemung River and it into the Susquehanna. There were no natural barriers, like the Cohoes Falls on the Mohawk, to impede transportation, and timber and other agricultural products were easily shipped downriver from what are today (2019) the towns of Addison, Canisteo, and Hornellsville. Prior to the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, followed by the railroads, communication with the Hudson Valley and New York City was difficult. Limited to horses, mules, and donkeys, it was far too expensive to be used to ship bulky agricultural products.

In 1892 a bill was introduced in the Legislature to split Steuben County, with Canisteo, Corning, and &quot;the south towns&quot; becoming Lincoln County. It did not pass.

==Geography==

<doc id="55483" wikidata="Q483034" url="?curid=55483" title="Robinson Crusoe">
<text>Robinson Crusoe ( ) is an English adventure novel by Daniel Defoe, first published on 25 April 1719. Written with a combination of epistolary, confessional, and didactic forms, the book follows the title character (born Robinson Kreutznaer) after he is cast away and spends 28 years on a remote tropical desert island near the coasts of Venezuela and Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers before being rescued. The story has been thought to be based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on a Pacific island called &quot;Más a Tierra&quot; (now part of Chile) which was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966. Pedro Serrano is another real-life castaway whose story might have inspired the novel.

The first edition credited the work&#x27;s protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, leading many readers to believe he was a real person and that the book was a non-fiction travelogue. Despite its simple narrative style, &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was well received in the literary world and is often credited as marking the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre. Some allege it is a contender for the first English novel.

Before the end of 1719, the book had already run through four editions, and it has gone on to become one of the most widely published books in history, spawning so many imitations, not only in literature but also in film, television, and radio, that its name is used to define a genre, the Robinsonade.

==Plot summary==

Robinson Crusoe (the family name corrupted from the German name &quot;Kreutznaer&quot;) sets sail from Kingston upon Hull, England, on a sea voyage in August 1651, against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in law. After a tumultuous journey where his ship is wrecked in a storm, his desire for the sea remains so strong that he sets out to sea again. This journey, too, ends in disaster, as the ship is taken over by Salé pirates (the Salé Rovers) and Crusoe is enslaved by a Moor. Two years later, he escapes in a boat with a boy named Xury; a captain of a Portuguese ship off the west coast of Africa rescues him. The ship is &quot;en route&quot; to Brazil. Crusoe sells Xury to the captain. With the captain&#x27;s help, Crusoe procures a plantation in Brazil.

Years later, Crusoe joins an expedition to purchase slaves from Africa but the ship gets blown off course in a storm about forty miles out to sea and runs aground on the sandbar of an island off the Venezuelan coast (which he calls the &quot;Island of Despair&quot;) near the mouth of the Orinoco River on 30 September 1659. The crew lowers the jolly boat, but it gets swamped by a tidal wave, drowning the crew, but leaving Crusoe the sole human survivor. He observes the latitude as 9 degrees and 22 minutes north. He sees penguins and seals on this island. Aside from Crusoe, the captain&#x27;s dog and two cats survive the shipwreck. Overcoming his despair, he fetches arms, tools and other supplies from the ship before the next storm breaks it apart. He builds a fenced-in habitat near a cave which he excavates. By making marks in a wooden cross, he creates a calendar post to keep track of his time on the island. Over the years, by using tools salvaged from the ship, and some which he makes himself, he hunts animals, grows barley and rice, dries grapes to make raisins, learns to make pottery and traps and raises goats. He also adopts a small parrot. He reads the Bible and becomes religious, thanking God for his fate in which nothing is missing but human society. He also builds two boats: a large dugout canoe that he intends to use to sail to the mainland, but ends up being too large and too far from water to launch, and a smaller boat that he uses to explore the coast of the island.

More years pass and Crusoe discovers cannibals, who occasionally visit the island to kill and eat prisoners. Alarmed at this, he conserves the ammunition he&#x27;d used for hunting (running low at that point) for defence and fortifies his home in case the cannibals discover his presence on the island. He plans to kill them for committing an abomination, but later realizes he has no right to do so, as the cannibals do not knowingly commit a crime. One day, Crusoe finds that a Spanish Galleon has run aground on the island during a storm, but his hopes for rescue are dashed when he discovers that the crew abandoned ship. Nevertheless, the abandoned galleon&#x27;s untouched supplies of food and ammunition, along with the ship&#x27;s dog, add to Crusoe&#x27;s reserves. Every night, he dreams of obtaining one or two servants by freeing some prisoners; during the cannibals&#x27; next visit to the island, when a prisoner escapes, Crusoe helps him, naming his new companion &quot;Friday&quot; after the day of the week he appeared. Crusoe teaches Friday the English language and converts him to Christianity.

Crusoe soon learns from Friday that the crew from the shipwrecked galleon he&#x27;d found had escaped to the mainland and are now living with Friday&#x27;s tribe. Seeing renewed hope for rescue and with Friday&#x27;s help, Crusoe builds another, but smaller, dugout canoe for a renewed plan to sail to the mainland. After more cannibals arrive to partake in a feast, Crusoe and Friday kill most of them and save two prisoners. One is Friday&#x27;s father and the other is a Spaniard, who informs Crusoe about the other Spaniards shipwrecked on the mainland. A plan is devised wherein the Spaniard would return to the mainland with Friday&#x27;s father and bring back the others, build a ship, and sail to a Spanish port.

Before the Spaniards return, an English ship appears; the sailors have staged a mutiny against their captain and intend to leave him and those still loyal to him on the island. Crusoe and the ship&#x27;s captain strike a deal in which Crusoe helps the captain and the loyal sailors retake the ship. With their ringleader executed by the captain, the mutineers take up Crusoe&#x27;s offer to remain on the island rather than being returned to England as prisoners to be hanged. Before embarking for England, Crusoe shows the mutineers how he survived on the island and states that the Spaniards will be coming.

Crusoe leaves the island on 19 December 1686 and arrives in England on 11 June 1687. He learns that his family believed him dead; as a result, he was left nothing in his father&#x27;s will. Crusoe departs for Lisbon to reclaim the profits of his estate in Brazil, which has granted him much wealth. In conclusion, he transports his wealth overland to England from Portugal to avoid travelling by sea. Friday accompanies him and, &quot;en route&quot;, they endure one last adventure together as they fight off famished wolves while crossing the Pyrenees.

== Sources and real-life castaways ==

There were many stories of real-life castaways in Defoe&#x27;s time. Most famously, Defoe&#x27;s suspected inspiration for &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; is thought to be Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who spent four years on the uninhabited island of Más a Tierra (renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966) in the Juan Fernández Islands off the Chilean coast. Selkirk was rescued in 1709 by Woodes Rogers during a British expedition that led to the publication of Selkirk&#x27;s adventures in both &quot;A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World&quot; and &quot;A Cruising Voyage Around the World&quot; in 1712. According to Tim Severin, &quot;Daniel Defoe, a secretive man, neither confirmed nor denied that Selkirk was the model for the hero of his book. Apparently written in six months or less, &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was a publishing phenomenon.&quot;

According to Andrew Lambert, author of &quot;Crusoe&#x27;s Island&quot;, it is a &quot;false premise&quot; to suppose that Defoe&#x27;s novel was inspired by the experiences of a single person such as Selkirk, because the story is &quot;a complex compound of all the other buccaneer survival stories.&quot; However, &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; is far from a copy of Rogers&#x27; account: Becky Little argues three events that distinguish the two stories:
# Robinson Crusoe was shipwrecked while Selkirk decided to leave his ship, thus marooning himself;
# The island that Crusoe was shipwrecked on had already been inhabited, unlike the solitary nature of Selkirk&#x27;s adventures.
# The last and most crucial difference between the two stories is that Selkirk was a privateer, looting and raiding coastal cities during the War of Spanish Succession.
&quot;The economic and dynamic thrust of the book is completely alien to what the buccaneers are doing,&quot; Lambert says. &quot;The buccaneers just want to capture some loot and come home and drink it all, and Crusoe isn&#x27;t doing that at all. He&#x27;s an economic imperialist: He&#x27;s creating a world of trade and profit.&quot;

Other possible sources for the narrative include Ibn Tufail&#x27;s &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot;, and Spanish sixteenth-century sailor Pedro Serrano. Ibn Tufail&#x27;s &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot; is a twelfth-century philosophical novel also set on a desert island, and translated from Arabic into Latin and English a number of times in the half-century preceding Defoe&#x27;s novel.

Pedro Luis Serrano was a Spanish sailor who was marooned for seven or eight years on a small desert island after shipwrecking in the 1520s on a small island in the Caribbean off the coast of Nicaragua. He had no access to fresh water and lived off the blood and flesh of sea turtles and birds. He was quite a celebrity when he returned to Europe; before passing away, he recorded the hardships suffered in documents that show the endless anguish and suffering, the product of absolute abandonment to his fate, now held in the General Archive of the Indies, in Seville. It is quite possible that Defoe heard his story in one of his visits to Spain before becoming a writer.

Yet another source for Defoe&#x27;s novel may have been the Robert Knox account of his abduction by the King of Ceylon Rajasinha II of Kandy in 1659 in &quot;An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon&quot;.

Severin (2002) unravels a much wider range of potential sources of inspiration, and concludes by identifying castaway surgeon Henry Pitman as the most likely:

:An employee of the Duke of Monmouth, Pitman played a part in the Monmouth Rebellion. His short book about his desperate escape from a Caribbean penal colony, followed by his shipwrecking and subsequent desert island misadventures, was published by John Taylor of Paternoster Row, London, whose son William Taylor later published Defoe&#x27;s novel.

Severin argues that since Pitman appears to have lived in the lodgings above the father&#x27;s publishing house and that Defoe himself was a mercer in the area at the time, Defoe may have met Pitman in person and learned of his experiences first-hand, or possibly through submission of a draft. Severin also discusses another publicized case of a marooned man named only as Will, of the Miskito people of Central America, who may have led to the depiction of Friday.

Secord (1963) analyses the composition of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and gives a list of possible sources of the story, rejecting the common theory that the story of Selkirk is Defoe&#x27;s only source.

==Reception and sequels==

The book was published on 25 April 1719. Before the end of the year, this first volume had run through four editions.

By the end of the nineteenth century, no book in the history of Western literature had more editions, spin-offs, and translations (even into languages such as Inuktitut, Coptic, and Maltese) than &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, with more than 700 such alternative versions, including children&#x27;s versions with pictures and no text.

The term &quot;Robinsonade&quot; was coined to describe the genre of stories similar to &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.

Defoe went on to write a lesser-known sequel, &quot;The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719). It was intended to be the last part of his stories, according to the original title page of the sequel&#x27;s first edition, but a third book was published (1720), &quot;Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick World&quot;.

== Interpretations of the novel ==

The novel has been subject to numerous analyses and interpretations since its publication. In a sense, Crusoe attempts to replicate his society on the island. This is achieved through the use of European technology, agriculture and even a rudimentary political hierarchy. Several times in the novel Crusoe refers to himself as the &quot;king&quot; of the island, while the captain describes him as the &quot;governor&quot; to the mutineers. At the very end of the novel the island is referred to as a &quot;colony&quot;. The idealized master-servant relationship Defoe depicts between Crusoe and Friday can also be seen in terms of cultural assimilation, with Crusoe representing the &quot;enlightened&quot; European while Friday is the &quot;savage&quot; who can only be redeemed from his cultural manners through assimilation into Crusoe&#x27;s culture. Nonetheless, Defoe used Friday to criticize the Spanish colonization of the Americas.

According to J.P. Hunter, Robinson is not a hero but an everyman. He begins as a wanderer, aimless on a sea he does not understand, and ends as a pilgrim, crossing a final mountain to enter the promised land. The book tells the story of how Robinson becomes closer to God, not through listening to sermons in a church but through spending time alone amongst nature with only a Bible to read.

Conversely, cultural critic and literary scholar Michael Gurnow views the novel from a Rousseauian perspective: The central character&#x27;s movement from a primitive state to a more civilized one is interpreted as Crusoe&#x27;s denial of humanity&#x27;s state of nature.

&quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; is filled with religious aspects. Defoe was a Puritan moralist and normally worked in the guide tradition, writing books on how to be a good Puritan Christian, such as &quot;The New Family Instructor&quot; (1727) and &quot;Religious Courtship&quot; (1722). While &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; is far more than a guide, it shares many of the themes and theological and moral points of view.

&quot;Crusoe&quot; may have been taken from Timothy Cruso, a classmate of Defoe&#x27;s who had written guide books, including &quot;God the Guide of Youth&quot; (1695), before dying at an early age – just eight years before Defoe wrote &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. Cruso would have been remembered by contemporaries and the association with guide books is clear. It has even been speculated that &quot;God the Guide of Youth&quot; inspired &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; because of a number of passages in that work that are closely tied to the novel. A leitmotif of the novel is the Christian notion of providence, penitence, and redemption. Crusoe comes to repent of the follies of his youth. Defoe also foregrounds this theme by arranging highly significant events in the novel to occur on Crusoe&#x27;s birthday. The denouement culminates not only in Crusoe&#x27;s deliverance from the island, but his spiritual deliverance, his acceptance of Christian doctrine, and in his intuition of his own salvation.

When confronted with the cannibals, Crusoe wrestles with the problem of cultural relativism. Despite his disgust, he feels unjustified in holding the natives morally responsible for a practice so deeply ingrained in their culture. Nevertheless, he retains his belief in an absolute standard of morality; he regards cannibalism as a &quot;national crime&quot; and forbids Friday from practising it.

=== Economics and civilization ===

In classical, neoclassical and Austrian economics, Crusoe is regularly used to illustrate the theory of production and choice in the absence of trade, money, and prices. Crusoe must allocate effort between production and leisure and must choose between alternative production possibilities to meet his needs. The arrival of Friday is then used to illustrate the possibility of trade and the gains that result.

The work has been variously read as an allegory for the development of civilization; as a manifesto of economic individualism; and as an expression of European colonial desires. Significantly, it also shows the importance of repentance and illustrates the strength of Defoe&#x27;s religious convictions. Critic M.E. Novak supports the connection between the religious and economic themes within &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, citing Defoe&#x27;s religious ideology as the influence for his portrayal of Crusoe&#x27;s economic ideals, and his support of the individual. Novak cites Ian Watt&#x27;s extensive research which explores the impact that several Romantic Era novels had against economic individualism, and the reversal of those ideals that takes place within &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.

In Tess Lewis&#x27;s review, &quot;The heroes we deserve&quot;, of Ian Watt&#x27;s article, she furthers Watt&#x27;s argument with a development on Defoe&#x27;s intention as an author, &quot;to use individualism to signify nonconformity in religion and the admirable qualities of self-reliance&quot;. This further supports the belief that Defoe used aspects of spiritual autobiography to introduce the benefits of individualism to a not entirely convinced religious community. J. Paul Hunter has written extensively on the subject of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; as apparent spiritual autobiography, tracing the influence of Defoe&#x27;s Puritan ideology through Crusoe&#x27;s narrative, and his acknowledgement of human imperfection in pursuit of meaningful spiritual engagements – the cycle of &quot;repentance [and] deliverance&quot;.

This spiritual pattern and its episodic nature, as well as the re-discovery of earlier female novelists, have kept &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; from being classified as a novel, let alone the first novel written in English – despite the blurbs on some book covers. Early critics, such as Robert Louis Stevenson, admired it, saying that the footprint scene in &quot;Crusoe&quot; was one of the four greatest in English literature and most unforgettable; more prosaically, Wesley Vernon has seen the origins of forensic podiatry in this episode. It has inspired a new genre, the &quot;Robinsonade&quot;, as works such as Johann David Wyss&#x27; &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1812) adapt its premise and has provoked modern postcolonial responses, including J. M. Coetzee&#x27;s &quot;Foe&quot; (1986) and Michel Tournier&#x27;s &quot;Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique&quot; (in English, &quot;Friday, or, The Other Island&quot;) (1967). Two sequels followed: Defoe&#x27;s &quot;The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719) and his &quot;Serious reflections during the life and surprising adventures of Robinson Crusoe: with his Vision of the angelick world&quot; (1720). Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726) is in part a parody of Defoe&#x27;s adventure novel.

==Legacy==
===Influence on language===
The book proved to be so popular that the names of the two main protagonists, Crusoe and Friday, have entered the language. During World War II, people who decided to stay and hide in the ruins of the German-occupied city of Warsaw for a period of three winter months, from October to January 1945, when they were rescued by the Red Army, were later called Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw (&quot;Robinsonowie warszawscy&quot;). Robinson Crusoe usually referred to his servant as &quot;my man Friday&quot;, from which the term &quot;Man Friday&quot; (or &quot;Girl Friday&quot;) originated.

===Influence on literature===
&quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; marked the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre. Its success led to many imitators; and castaway novels, written by Ambrose Evans, Penelope Aubin, and others, became quite popular in Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Most of these have fallen into obscurity, but some became established, including &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, which borrowed Crusoe&#x27;s first name for its title.

Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, published seven years after &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe&#x27;s optimistic account of human capability. In &quot;The Unthinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Man&quot;, Warren Montag argues that Swift was concerned about refuting the notion that the individual precedes society, as Defoe&#x27;s novel seems to suggest. In &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, author Robert Louis Stevenson parodies Crusoe with the character of Ben Gunn, a friendly castaway who was marooned for many years, has a wild appearance, dresses entirely in goat skin, and constantly talks about providence.

In Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s treatise on education, &quot;Emile, or on Education&quot;, the one book the protagonist is allowed to read before the age of twelve is &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. Rousseau wants Emile to identify himself as Crusoe so he can rely upon himself for all of his needs. In Rousseau&#x27;s view, Emile needs to imitate Crusoe&#x27;s experience, allowing necessity to determine what is to be learned and accomplished. This is one of the main themes of Rousseau&#x27;s educational model.

In &quot;The Tale of Little Pig Robinson&quot;, Beatrix Potter directs the reader to &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; for a detailed description of the island (the land of the Bong tree) to which her eponymous hero moves. In Wilkie Collins&#x27; most popular novel, &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, one of the chief characters and narrators, Gabriel Betteredge, has faith in all that Robinson Crusoe says and uses the book for a sort of divination. He considers &quot;The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot; the finest book ever written, reads it over and over again, and considers a man but poorly read if he had happened not to read the book.

French novelist Michel Tournier published &quot;Friday, or, The Other Island&quot; (French &quot;Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique&quot;) in 1967. His novel explores themes including civilization versus nature, the psychology of solitude, as well as death and sexuality in a retelling of Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; story. Tournier&#x27;s Robinson chooses to remain on the island, rejecting civilization when offered the chance to escape 28 years after being shipwrecked. Likewise, in 1963, J. M. G. Le Clézio, winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature, published the novel &quot;Le Proces-Verbal&quot;. The book&#x27;s epigraph is a quote from &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, and like Crusoe, the novel&#x27;s protagonist Adam Pollo suffers long periods of loneliness.

&quot;Crusoe in England&quot;, a 183 line poem by Elizabeth Bishop, imagines Crusoe near the end of his life, recalling his time of exile with a mixture of bemusement and regret.

J. M. Coetzee&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;Foe&quot; recounts the tale of Robinson Crusoe from the perspective of a woman named Susan Barton.

Other stories that share similar themes to &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; include William Golding&#x27;s &quot;Lord Of The Flies&quot; (1954), J. G. Ballard&#x27;s &quot;Concrete Island&quot; (1974), and Andy Weir&#x27;s &quot;The Martian&quot; (2011).

==== Inverted Crusoeism ====
The term &quot;inverted Crusoeism&quot; was coined by J. G. Ballard. The paradigm of Robinson Crusoe has been a recurring topic in Ballard&#x27;s work. Whereas the original Robinson Crusoe became a castaway against his own will, Ballard&#x27;s protagonists often choose to maroon themselves; hence inverted Crusoeism (e.g., Concrete Island). The concept provides a reason as to why people would deliberately maroon themselves on a remote island; in Ballard&#x27;s work, becoming a castaway is as much a healing and empowering process as an entrapping one, enabling people to discover a more meaningful and vital existence.

===Comic strip adaptations===
The story was also illustrated and published in comic book form by &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; in 1943 and 1957. The much improved 1957 version was inked / penciled by Sam Citron, who is most well known for his contributions to the earlier issues of &quot;Superman&quot;. British illustrator Reginald Ben Davis drew a female version of the story titled &quot;Jill Crusoe, Castaway&quot; (1950–1959).

Bob Mankoff, cartoon editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; attributes the genre of desert island cartoons, which began appearing in the publication in the 1930s, to the popularity of Robinson Crusoe.

===Stage adaptations===
A pantomime version of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1796, with Joseph Grimaldi as Pierrot in the harlequinade. The piece was produced again in 1798, this time starring Grimaldi as Clown. In 1815, Grimaldi played Friday in another version of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.

Jacques Offenbach wrote an opéra comique called &quot;Robinson Crusoé&quot;, which was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 23 November 1867. This was based on the British pantomime version rather than the novel itself. The libretto was by Eugène Cormon and Hector-Jonathan Crémieux.

There have been a number of other stage adaptations, including those by Isaac Pocock, Jim Helsinger and Steve Shaw and a musical by Victor Prince.

===Film adaptations===
There is a 1927 silent film titled &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. The Soviet 3D film &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was produced in 1947.

One of the first adaptations still available dates from 1932 titled &quot;Mr. Robinson Crusoe&quot;. This film was produced by Douglas Fairbanks Sr and directed by Eddie Sutherland. Set in Tahiti, the film depicts Defoe trying to survive on a desert island for almost a year. This film was not very successful.

Luis Buñuel directed &quot;Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot; starring Dan O&#x27;Herlihy, released in 1954. Luis Buñuel filmed an account which at first viewing appeared to be a rather simple straightforward telling of Robinson Crusoe. A big stand out with this film is that Buñuel breaks the previous films&#x27; traditions of having Friday as a slave and Crusoe as the master. The two manage to become actually friends and they operate essentially as equals.

In 1966, Walt Disney later comedicized the novel with &quot;Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.&quot;, featuring Dick Van Dyke. In this version, Friday became a beautiful woman, but named &#x27;Wednesday&#x27; instead.

Variations on the theme include the 1954 &quot;Miss Robin Crusoe&quot;, with a female castaway, played by Amanda Blake, and a female Friday, and in 1965 we get the film adaptation &quot;Robinson Crusoe on Mars&quot;, starring Paul Mantee, with an alien Friday portrayed by Victor Lundin and an added character played by Adam West. Byron Haskins manages to underscore Crusoe&#x27;s removal and field of the red planet that we call mars. Our main character meets a Friday-esque character but makes no effort to try and understand his language. Like the book, in this film, Friday is trying to escape from cruel masters. This movie has lots of appeal to fans of adventures stories and the film has a distinctive visual style that adds to its character.

In 1968, American writer/director Ralph C. Bluemke made a family-friendly version of the story titled &quot;Robby&quot;, in which the main characters were portrayed as children. It starred Warren Raum as Robby (Robinson Crusoe) and Ryp Siani as Friday (who were the director&#x27;s first choices for the roles). Bluemke originally conceived the idea while working at a bank in 1960. Given the nature and location of the script, Bluemke knew from the beginning that the film would require a certain amount of nudity in order to give it a sense of realism and authenticity. At the time, he was under the impression that the nudity depicted in the film would be condoned as natural and innocent, given the backdrop of the story, and given that the actors involved were prepubescent boys. The film failed to secure a wide distribution deal, in part because prospective distributors were wary about the extensive nudity featured in the film. Undaunted, the producers raised enough capital to release the film themselves, acting as their own distributor. It had limited screenings on Broadway in New York City on August 14, 1968.

Peter O&#x27;Toole and Richard Roundtree co-starred in a 1975 film &quot;Man Friday&quot; which sardonically portrayed Crusoe as incapable of seeing his dark-skinned companion as anything but an inferior creature, while Friday is more enlightened and sympathetic. In 1988, Aidan Quinn portrayed Robinson Crusoe in the film &quot;Crusoe&quot;. A 1997 movie entitled &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; starred Pierce Brosnan and received limited commercial success. The 2000 film &quot;Cast Away&quot;, with Tom Hanks as a FedEx employee stranded on an island for many years, also borrows much from the Robinson Crusoe story.

In 1981, Czechoslovakian director and animator Stanislav Látal made a version of the story under the name &quot;Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, a Sailor from York&quot; combining traditional and stop-motion animation. The movie was coproduced by regional West Germany broadcaster Südwestfunk Baden-Baden.

===Animated adaptations===
In 1988, an animated cartoon for children called &quot;Classic Adventure Stories Robinson Crusoe&quot; was released. Crusoe&#x27;s early sea travels are simplified, as his ship outruns the Salé Rovers pirates but then gets wrecked in a storm.

And then in 1995 the BBC first aired the series &quot;Robinson Sucroe&quot; until 1998, with The Children&#x27;s Channel and Pop repeating it.

=== Radio adaptations ===
&quot;Daniel Defoe – Robinson Crusoe&quot; was adapted as a two-part play for BBC radio. Dramatised by Steve Chambers and directed by Marion Nancarrow, and starring Roy Marsden and Tom Bevan, it was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in May 1998. It was subsequently rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in February 2023.

===TV adaptations===
In 1964, a French film production crew made a 13-part serial of &quot;The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot;. It starred Robert Hoffmann. The black-and-white series was dubbed into English and German. In the UK, the BBC broadcast it on numerous occasions between 1965 and 1977.

The 2008–2009 &quot;Crusoe&quot; TV series was a 13-part show created by Stephen Gallagher.

Two 2000s reality television series, &quot;Expedition Robinson&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot;, have their contestants try to survive on an isolated location, usually an island. The concept is influenced by &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.

In 1791, Tioga County was founded by another division of territory from Montgomery County. At the time of its foundation, Tioga County included present-day Broome and Chemung counties and parts of Chenango and Schuyler counties.

Tioga County was reduced in size in 1798 by the splitting-off of Chemung County (which also included part of the present Schuyler County and by the combination of a portion with a portion of Herkimer County to create Chenango County. In 1806, it was further reduced by the splitting-off of Broome County.

<doc id="55490" wikidata="Q25161" url="?curid=55490" title="Roald Dahl">
<text>Roald Dahl (13 September 1916 – 23 November 1990) was a British author of popular children&#x27;s literature and short stories, a poet, screenwriter and a wartime fighter ace. His books have sold more than 300 million copies worldwide. He has been called &quot;one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century&quot;.

Dahl was born in Wales to affluent Norwegian immigrant parents, and lived for most of his life in England. He served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He became a fighter pilot and, subsequently, an intelligence officer, rising to the rank of acting wing commander. He rose to prominence as a writer in the 1940s with works for children and for adults, and he became one of the world&#x27;s best-selling authors. His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement and the British Book Awards&#x27; Children&#x27;s Author of the Year in 1990. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; placed Dahl 16th on its list of &quot;The 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him the top-earning dead celebrity.

Dahl&#x27;s short stories are known for their unexpected endings, and his children&#x27;s books for their unsentimental, macabre, often darkly comic mood, featuring villainous adult enemies of the child characters. His children&#x27;s books champion the kindhearted and feature an underlying warm sentiment. His works for children include &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;Matilda&quot;, &quot;The Witches&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Mr Fox&quot;, &quot;The BFG&quot;, &quot;The Twits&quot;, &quot;George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine&quot; and &quot;Danny, the Champion of the World&quot;. His works for older audiences include the short story collections &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; and &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More&quot;.

==Early life and education==
=== Childhood ===

Roald Dahl was born in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales, to Norwegians Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (&quot;née&quot; Hesselberg). Dahl&#x27;s father, a wealthy shipbroker and self-made man, had emigrated to Britain from Sarpsborg, Norway and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s with his first wife, Frenchwoman Marie Beaurin-Gresser. They had two children together (Ellen Marguerite and Louis) before her death in 1907. Roald&#x27;s mother belonged to a well-established Norwegian family of lawyers, priests in the state church and wealthy merchants and estate owners, and emigrated to Britain when she married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen. His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild, and Else. The children were raised in Norway&#x27;s Lutheran state church, the Church of Norway, and were baptised at the Norwegian Church, Cardiff. His maternal grandmother Ellen Wallace was a granddaughter of the member of parliament Georg Wallace and a descendant of an early 18th-century Scottish immigrant to Norway.

Dahl&#x27;s sister Astri died from appendicitis at age seven in 1920 when Dahl was three years old, and his father died of pneumonia at age 57 several weeks later. Later in the same year, his youngest sister, Asta, was born. Upon his death, Harald Dahl left a fortune assessed for probate of £158,917 10s. 0d. (equivalent to £ in ). Dahl&#x27;s mother decided to remain in Wales instead of returning to Norway to live with relatives, as her husband had wanted their children to be educated in English schools, which he considered the world&#x27;s best. When he was six years old, Dahl met his idol Beatrix Potter, author of &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; featuring the mischievous Peter Rabbit, the first licensed fictional character. The meeting, which took place at Potter&#x27;s home, Hill Top in the Lake District, north west England, was dramatised in the 2020 television film, &quot;Roald &amp; Beatrix: The Tail of the Curious Mouse&quot;.
Dahl first attended The Cathedral School, Llandaff. At age eight, he and four of his friends were caned by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of gobstoppers at the local sweet shop, which was owned by a &quot;mean and loathsome&quot; old woman named Mrs Pratchett. The five boys named their prank the &quot;Great Mouse Plot of 1924&quot;. Mrs Pratchett inspired Dahl&#x27;s creation of the cruel headmistress Miss Trunchbull in &quot;Matilda&quot;, and a prank, this time in a water jug belonging to Trunchbull, would also appear in the book. Gobstoppers were a favourite sweet among British schoolboys between the two World Wars, and Dahl referred to them in his fictional Everlasting Gobstopper which was featured in &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

Dahl transferred to St Peter&#x27;s boarding school in Weston-super-Mare. His parents had wanted him to be educated at an English public school, and this proved to be the nearest because of the regular ferry link across the Bristol Channel. Dahl&#x27;s time at St Peter&#x27;s was unpleasant; he was very homesick and wrote to his mother every week but never revealed his unhappiness to her. After her death in 1967, he learned that she had saved every one of his letters; they were broadcast in abridged form as BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Week&quot; in 2016 to mark the centenary of his birth. Dahl wrote about his time at St Peter&#x27;s in his autobiography &quot;Boy: Tales of Childhood&quot;. Excelling at conkers—a traditional autumnal children&#x27;s game in Britain and Ireland played using the seeds of horse chestnut trees—Dahl recollected, &quot;at the ages of eight, nine and ten, conkers brought sunshine to our lives during the dreary autumn term&quot;.

=== Repton School ===

From 1929, when he was 13, Dahl attended Repton School in Derbyshire. Dahl disliked the hazing and described an environment of ritual cruelty and status domination, with younger boys having to act as personal servants for older boys, frequently subject to terrible beatings. His biographer Donald Sturrock described these violent experiences in Dahl&#x27;s early life. Dahl expresses some of these darker experiences in his writings, which is also marked by his hatred of cruelty and corporal punishment.

According to Dahl&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Boy: Tales of Childhood&quot;, a friend named Michael was viciously caned by headmaster Geoffrey Fisher. Writing in that same book, Dahl reflected: &quot;All through my school life I was appalled by the fact that masters and senior boys were allowed literally to wound other boys, and sometimes quite severely... I couldn&#x27;t get over it. I never have got over it.&quot; Fisher was later appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, and he crowned Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. However, according to Dahl&#x27;s biographer Jeremy Treglown, the caning took place in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton; the headmaster was in fact J. T. Christie, Fisher&#x27;s successor as headmaster. Dahl said the incident caused him to &quot;have doubts about religion and even about God&quot;. He viewed the brutality of the caning as being the result of the headmaster&#x27;s enmity towards children, an attitude Dahl would later attribute to the Grand High Witch in his dark fantasy &quot;The Witches&quot;, with the novel&#x27;s main antagonist exclaiming that &quot;children are rrreee-volting!&quot;.

Dahl was never seen as a particularly talented writer in his school years, with one of his English teachers writing in his school report, &quot;I have never met anybody who so persistently writes words meaning the exact opposite of what is intended.&quot; He was exceptionally tall, reaching in adult life. Dahl played sports including cricket, football and golf, and was made captain of the squash team. As well as having a passion for literature, he developed an interest in photography and often carried a camera with him.

During his years at Repton, the Cadbury chocolate company occasionally sent boxes of new chocolates to the school to be tested by the pupils. Dahl dreamt of inventing a new chocolate bar that would win the praise of Mr Cadbury himself; this inspired him in writing his third children&#x27;s book, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, and to refer to chocolate in other children&#x27;s books.

Throughout his childhood and adolescent years, Dahl spent most of his summer holidays with his mother&#x27;s family in Norway. He wrote about many happy memories from those visits in &quot;Boy: Tales of Childhood&quot;, such as when he replaced the tobacco in his half-sister&#x27;s fiancé&#x27;s pipe with goat droppings. He noted only one unhappy memory of his holidays in Norway: at around the age of eight, he had to have his adenoids removed by a doctor. His childhood and first job selling kerosene in Midsomer Norton and surrounding villages in Somerset are subjects in &quot;Boy: Tales of Childhood&quot;.

=== After school ===
After finishing his schooling, in August 1934 Dahl crossed the Atlantic on the and hiked through Newfoundland with the British Public Schools Exploring Society.

In July 1934, Dahl joined the Shell Petroleum Company. Following four years of training in the United Kingdom, he was assigned first to Mombasa, Kenya, then to Dar es Salaam in the British colony of Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania). Dahl explains in his autobiography &quot;Going Solo&quot; that only three young Englishmen ran the Shell company in the territory, of which he was the youngest and junior. Along with the only two other Shell employees in the entire territory, he lived in luxury in the Shell House outside Dar es Salaam, with a cook and personal servants. While out on assignments supplying oil to customers across Tanganyika, he encountered black mamba snakes and lions, among other wildlife.

== Fighter pilot ==

In August 1939, as the Second World War loomed, the British made plans to round up the hundreds of Germans living in Dar-es-Salaam. Dahl was commissioned as a lieutenant into the King&#x27;s African Rifles, commanding a platoon of Askari men, indigenous troops who were serving in the colonial army.

In November 1939, Dahl joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) as an aircraftman with service number 774022. After a car journey from Dar es Salaam to Nairobi, he was accepted for flight training with sixteen other men, of whom only three survived the war. With seven hours and 40 minutes experience in a De Havilland Tiger Moth, he flew solo; Dahl enjoyed watching the wildlife of Kenya during his flights. He continued to advanced flying training in Iraq, at RAF Habbaniya, west of Baghdad. Following six months&#x27; training on Hawker Harts, Dahl was commissioned as a pilot officer on 24 August 1940, and was judged ready to join a squadron and face the enemy.

He was assigned to No. 80 Squadron RAF, flying obsolete Gloster Gladiators, the last biplane fighter aircraft used by the RAF. Dahl was surprised to find that he would not receive any specialised training in aerial combat or in flying Gladiators. On 19 September 1940, Dahl and another pilot were ordered to fly their Gladiators by stages from Abu Sueir (near Ismailia, in Egypt) to 80 Squadron&#x27;s forward airstrip south of Mersa Matruh. On the final leg, they could not find the airstrip and, running low on fuel and with night approaching, Dahl was forced to attempt a landing in the desert. The undercarriage hit a boulder and the aircraft crashed. Dahl&#x27;s skull was fractured and his nose was smashed; he was temporarily blinded. He managed to drag himself away from the wreckage and lost consciousness. His colleague, Douglas McDonald, had landed safely and was able to comfort Dahl until they were rescued. He wrote about the crash in his first published work. Dahl came to believe that the head injury he sustained in the crash resulted in his creative genius.

Dahl was rescued and taken to a first-aid post in Mersa Matruh, where he regained consciousness, but not his sight. He remained blind for six weeks due to massive swelling of the brain. He was transported by train to the Royal Navy hospital in Alexandria. There he fell in and out of love with a nurse, Mary Welland. An RAF inquiry into the crash revealed that the location to which he had been told to fly was completely wrong, and he had mistakenly been sent instead into the no man&#x27;s land between the Allied and Italian forces.

In February 1941, Dahl was discharged from the hospital and deemed fully fit for flying duties. By this time, 80 Squadron had been transferred to the Greek campaign and based at Eleusina, near Athens. The squadron was now equipped with Hawker Hurricanes. Dahl flew a replacement Hurricane across the Mediterranean Sea in April 1941, after seven hours&#x27; experience flying Hurricanes. By this stage in the Greek campaign, the RAF had only 18 combat aircraft in Greece: 14 Hurricanes and four Bristol Blenheim light bombers. Dahl flew in his first aerial combat on 15 April 1941, while flying alone over the city of Chalcis. He attacked six Junkers Ju 88s that were bombing ships and shot one down. The next day, he shot down another Ju 88.

On 20 April 1941, Dahl took part in an event he called the Battle of Athens, alongside the highest-scoring British Commonwealth ace of World War II, Pat Pattle, and Dahl&#x27;s friend David Coke. Of 12 Hurricanes involved, five were shot down and four of their pilots killed, including Pattle. Greek observers on the ground counted 22 German aircraft downed, but because of the confusion of the aerial engagement, none of the pilots knew which aircraft they had shot down. Dahl described it as &quot;an endless blur of enemy fighters whizzing towards me from every side&quot;.

In May, as the Germans were pressing on Athens, Dahl was evacuated to Egypt. His squadron was reassembled in Haifa to take part in Operation Exporter. From there, Dahl flew sorties every day for a period of four weeks, shooting down a Vichy French Air Force Potez 63 on 8 June and another Ju 88 on 15 June. In a memoir, Dahl recounts in detail an attack by him and his fellow Hurricane pilots on the Vichy-held Rayak airfield. He says that as he and his fellow Hurricane pilots swept in:

... low over the field at midday we saw to our astonishment a bunch of girls in brightly coloured cotton dresses standing out by the planes with glasses in their hands having drinks with the French pilots, and I remember seeing bottles of wine standing on the wing of one of the planes as we went swooshing over. It was a Sunday morning and the Frenchmen were evidently entertaining their girlfriends and showing off their aircraft to them, which was a very French thing to do in the middle of a war at a front-line aerodrome. Every one of us held our fire on that first pass over the flying field and it was wonderfully comical to see the girls all dropping their wine glasses and galloping in their high heels for the door of the nearest building. We went round again, but this time we were no longer a surprise and they were ready for us with their ground defences, and I am afraid that our chivalry resulted in damage to several of our Hurricanes, including my own. But we destroyed five of their planes on the ground.

Despite this somewhat light-hearted account, Dahl also noted that, ultimately, Vichy forces killed four of the nine Hurricane pilots in his squadron. Describing the Vichy forces as &quot;disgusting&quot;, he stated that &quot;... thousands of lives were lost, and I for one have never forgiven the Vichy French for the unnecessary slaughter they caused.&quot;
When he began to get severe headaches that caused him to black out, he was invalided home to Britain where he stayed with his mother in Buckinghamshire. Although at this time Dahl was only a pilot officer on probation, in September 1941 he was simultaneously confirmed as a pilot officer and promoted to war substantive flying officer.

==Diplomat, writer and intelligence officer==
After being invalided home, Dahl was posted to an RAF training camp in Uxbridge. He attempted to recover his health enough to become an instructor. In late March 1942, while in London, he met the Under-Secretary of State for Air, Major Harold Balfour, at his club. Impressed by Dahl&#x27;s war record and conversational abilities, Balfour appointed the young man as assistant air attaché at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. Initially resistant, Dahl was finally persuaded by Balfour to accept, and took passage on the from Glasgow a few days later. He arrived in Halifax, Canada, on 14 April, after which he took a sleeper train to Montreal.

Coming from war-starved Britain (in what was a wartime period of rationing in the United Kingdom), Dahl was amazed by the wealth of food and amenities to be had in North America. Arriving in Washington a week later, Dahl found he liked the atmosphere of the US capital. He shared a house with another attaché at 1610 34th Street, NW, in Georgetown. But after ten days in his new posting, Dahl strongly disliked it, feeling he had taken on &quot;a most ungodly unimportant job&quot;. He later explained, &quot;I&#x27;d just come from the war. People were getting killed. I had been flying around, seeing horrible things. Now, almost instantly, I found myself in the middle of a pre-war cocktail party in America.&quot;

Dahl was unimpressed by his office in the British Air Mission, attached to the embassy. He was also unimpressed by the ambassador, Lord Halifax, with whom he sometimes played tennis and whom he described as &quot;a courtly English gentleman&quot;. Dahl socialised with Charles E. Marsh, a Texas publisher and oilman, at his house at 2136 R Street, NW, and the Marsh country estate in Virginia. As part of his duties as assistant air attaché, Dahl was to help neutralise the isolationist views still held by many Americans by giving pro-British speeches and discussing his war service; the United States had entered the war only the previous December, following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

At this time Dahl met the noted British novelist C. S. Forester, who was also working to aid the British war effort. Forester worked for the British Ministry of Information and was writing propaganda for the Allied cause, mainly for American consumption. &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; had asked Forester to write a story based on Dahl&#x27;s flying experiences; Forester asked Dahl to write down some RAF anecdotes so that he could shape them into a story. After Forester read what Dahl had given him, he decided to publish the story exactly as Dahl had written it. In reality a number of changes were made to the original manuscript before publication. He originally titled the article as &quot;A Piece of Cake&quot; but the magazine changed it to &quot;Shot Down Over Libya&quot; to make it sound more dramatic, although Dahl had not been shot down; it was published on 1 August 1942 issue of the &quot;Post&quot;. Dahl was promoted to flight lieutenant (war-substantive) in August 1942. Later he worked with such other well-known British officers as Ian Fleming (who later published the popular &quot;James Bond&quot; series) and David Ogilvy, promoting Britain&#x27;s interests and message in the US and combating the &quot;America First&quot; movement.

This work introduced Dahl to espionage and the activities of the Canadian spymaster William Stephenson, known by the codename &quot;Intrepid.&quot; During the war, Dahl supplied intelligence from Washington to Prime Minister Winston Churchill. As Dahl later said: &quot;My job was to try to help Winston to get on with FDR, and tell Winston what was in the old boy&#x27;s mind.&quot; Dahl also supplied intelligence to Stephenson and his organisation, known as British Security Coordination, which was part of MI6. Dahl was once sent back to Britain by British Embassy officials, supposedly for misconduct—&quot;I got booted out by the big boys&quot;, he said. Stephenson promptly sent him back to Washington—with a promotion to wing commander rank. Toward the end of the war, Dahl wrote some of the history of the secret organisation; he and Stephenson remained friends for decades after the war.

Upon the war&#x27;s conclusion, Dahl held the rank of a temporary wing commander (substantive flight lieutenant). Owing to the severity of his injuries from the 1940 accident, he was pronounced unfit for further service and was invalided out of the RAF in August 1946. He left the service with the substantive rank of squadron leader. His record of five aerial victories, qualifying him as a flying ace, has been confirmed by post-war research and cross-referenced in Axis records. It is possible that he shot down more aircraft, for example on 20 April 1941 when the Germans lost several aircraft.

==Post-war life==

Dahl married American actress Patricia Neal on 2 July 1953 at Trinity Church in New York City. Their marriage lasted for 30 years and they had five children:
* Olivia Twenty (1955–1962);
* Chantal Sophia &quot;Tessa&quot; (born 1957), who became an author, and mother of author, cookbook writer and former model Sophie Dahl (after whom Sophie in &quot;The BFG&quot; is named);
* Theo Matthew (born 1960);
* Ophelia Magdalena (born 1964);
* Lucy Neal (born 1965).
On 5 December 1960, four-month-old Theo was severely injured when his baby carriage was struck by a taxicab in New York City. For a time, he suffered from hydrocephalus. As a result, Dahl became involved in the development of what became known as the &quot;Wade-Dahl-Till&quot; (or WDT) valve, a device to improve the shunt used to alleviate the condition. The valve was a collaboration between Dahl, hydraulic engineer Stanley Wade, and London&#x27;s Great Ormond Street Hospital neurosurgeon Kenneth Till, and was used successfully on almost 3,000 children around the world.

In November 1962, Dahl&#x27;s daughter Olivia died of measles encephalitis, age seven. Her death left Dahl &quot;limp with despair&quot;, and feeling guilty about not having been able to do anything for her. Dahl subsequently became a proponent of immunisation—writing &quot;&quot; in 1988 in response to measles cases in the UK—and dedicated his 1982 book &quot;The BFG&quot; to his daughter. After Olivia&#x27;s death and a meeting with a Church official, Dahl came to view Christianity as a sham. In mourning he had sought spiritual guidance from Geoffrey Fisher, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, and was dismayed being told that, although Olivia was in Paradise, her beloved dog Rowley would never join her there. Dahl recalled years later:

In 1965, Dahl&#x27;s wife Patricia Neal suffered three burst cerebral aneurysms while pregnant with their fifth child, Lucy. Dahl took control of her rehabilitation over the next months; Neal had to re-learn to talk and walk, but she managed to return to her acting career. This period of their lives was dramatised in the film &quot;The Patricia Neal Story&quot; (1981), in which the couple were played by Glenda Jackson and Dirk Bogarde.

In 1972, Roald Dahl met Felicity d&#x27;Abreu Crosland, niece of Lt.-Col. Francis D&#x27;Abreu who was married to Margaret Bowes Lyon, the first cousin of the Queen Mother, while Felicity was working as a set designer on an advert for Maxim coffee with the author&#x27;s then wife, Patricia Neal. Soon after the pair were introduced, they began an 11-year affair. In 1983 Neal and Dahl divorced and Dahl married Felicity, at Brixton Town Hall, South London. Felicity (known as Liccy) gave up her job and moved into Gipsy House, Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire, which had been Dahl&#x27;s home since 1954.

In the 1986 New Years Honours List, Dahl was offered an appointment to Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), but turned it down. He reportedly wanted a knighthood so that his wife would be Lady Dahl. Dahl&#x27;s last significant involvement in medical charities during his lifetime was with dyslexia. In 1990, the year which saw the UN launch International Literacy Year, Dahl assisted with the British Dyslexia Association&#x27;s Awareness Campaign. That year saw Dahl write one of his last children&#x27;s books, &quot;The Vicar of Nibbleswicke&quot;, which features a vicar who has a fictitious form of dyslexia that causes him to pronounce words backwards. Called &quot;a comic tale in the best Dahl tradition of craziness&quot; by Waterstones, Dahl donated the rights of the book to the Dyslexia Institute in London.

In 2012, Dahl was featured in the list of &quot;The New Elizabethans&quot; to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named Dahl among the group of people in Britain &quot;whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character&quot;. In September 2016, Dahl&#x27;s daughter Lucy received the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Gold badge in his honour, the first time it had ever been awarded posthumously.

==Writing==
Dahl&#x27;s first published work, inspired by a meeting with C. S. Forester, was &quot;A Piece of Cake&quot;, on 1 August 1942. The story, about his wartime adventures, was bought by &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; for US$1,000 () and published under the title &quot;Shot Down Over Libya&quot;.

His first children&#x27;s book was &quot;The Gremlins&quot;, published in 1943, about mischievous little creatures that were part of Royal Air Force folklore. The RAF pilots blamed the gremlins for all the problems with the aircraft. The protagonist Gus—an RAF pilot, like Dahl—joins forces with the gremlins against a common enemy, Hitler and the Nazis. While at the British Embassy in Washington, Dahl sent a copy to the First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt who read it to her grandchildren, and the book was commissioned by Walt Disney for a film that was never made. Dahl went on to write some of the best-loved children&#x27;s stories of the 20th century, such as &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;Matilda&quot;, &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, &quot;The Witches&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Mr Fox&quot;, &quot;The BFG&quot;, &quot;The Twits&quot; and &quot;George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine&quot;.

Dahl also had a successful parallel career as the writer of macabre adult short stories, which often blended humour and innocence with surprising plot twists. The Mystery Writers of America presented Dahl with three Edgar Awards for his work, and many were originally written for American magazines such as &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;The Collector&#x27;s Item&quot; was &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; Star Story of the week for 4 September 1948), &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Works such as &quot;Kiss Kiss&quot; subsequently collected Dahl&#x27;s stories into anthologies, and gained significant popularity. Dahl wrote more than 60 short stories; they have appeared in numerous collections, some only being published in book form after his death. His three Edgar Awards were given for: in 1954, the collection &quot;Someone Like You&quot;; in 1959, the story &quot;The Landlady&quot;; and in 1980, the episode of &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; based on &quot;Skin&quot;.

One of his more famous adult stories, &quot;The Smoker&quot;, also known as &quot;Man from the South&quot;, was filmed twice as both 1960 and 1985 episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, filmed as a 1979 episode of &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, and also adapted into Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s segment of the film &quot;Four Rooms&quot; (1995). This oft-anthologised classic concerns a man in Jamaica who wagers with visitors in an attempt to claim the fingers from their hands. The original 1960 version in the Hitchcock series stars Steve McQueen and Peter Lorre. Five additional Dahl stories were used in the Hitchcock series. Dahl was credited with teleplay for two episodes, and four of his episodes were directed by Alfred Hitchcock himself, an example of which was &quot;Lamb to the Slaughter&quot; (1958).

Dahl acquired a traditional Romanichal vardo in the 1960s, and the family used it as a playhouse for his children at home in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. He later used the vardo as a writing room, where he wrote &quot;Danny, the Champion of the World&quot; in 1975. Dahl incorporated a similar caravan into the main plot of the book, where the young English boy, Danny, and his father, William (played by Jeremy Irons in the film adaptation) live in a vardo. Many other scenes and characters from Great Missenden are reflected in his work. For example, the village library was the inspiration for Mrs Phelps&#x27; library in &quot;Matilda&quot;, where the title character devours classic literature by the age of four.

His short story collection &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; was adapted to a successful TV series of the same name, beginning with &quot;Man from the South&quot;. When the stock of Dahl&#x27;s own original stories was exhausted, the series continued by adapting stories written in Dahl&#x27;s style by other authors, including John Collier and Stanley Ellin. Another collection of short stories, &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More&quot;, was published in 1977, and the eponymous short story was adapted into a short film in 2023 by director Wes Anderson with Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular character Henry Sugar and Ralph Fiennes as Dahl.

Some of Dahl&#x27;s short stories are supposed to be extracts from the diary of his (fictional) Uncle Oswald, a rich gentleman whose sexual exploits form the subject of these stories. In his novel &quot;My Uncle Oswald&quot;, the uncle engages a temptress to seduce 20th century geniuses and royalty with a love potion secretly added to chocolate truffles made by Dahl&#x27;s favourite chocolate shop, Prestat of Piccadilly, London. &quot;Memories with Food at Gipsy House&quot;, written with his wife Felicity and published posthumously in 1991, was a mixture of recipes, family reminiscences and Dahl&#x27;s musings on favourite subjects such as chocolate, onions and claret.

The last book published in his lifetime, &quot;Esio Trot&quot;, released in January 1990, marked a change in style for the author. Unlike other Dahl works (which often feature tyrannical adults and heroic/magical children), it is the story of an old, lonely man trying to make a connection with a woman he has loved from afar. In 1994, the English language audiobook recording of the book was provided by Monty Python member Michael Palin. Screenwriter Richard Curtis adapted it into a 2015 BBC television comedy film, &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Esio Trot&quot;, featuring Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench as the couple.

Written in 1990 and published posthumously in 1991, &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Guide to Railway Safety&quot; was one of the last things he ever wrote. In a response to rising levels of train-related fatalities involving children, the British Railways Board had asked Dahl to write the text of the booklet, and Quentin Blake to illustrate it, to help young people enjoy using the railways safely. The booklet is structured as a conversation with children, and it was distributed to primary school pupils in Britain. According to children&#x27;s literature critic Deborah Cogan Thacker, Dahl&#x27;s tendency in his children&#x27;s books is to &quot;put child characters in powerful positions&quot; and so, the idea of &quot;talking down&quot; to children was always an anathema to him, therefore Dahl, in the introduction of the booklet, states; &quot;I must now regretfully become one of those unpopular giants who tells you WHAT TO DO and WHAT NOT TO DO. This is something I have never done in any of my books.&quot;

===Children&#x27;s fiction===

Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s works are usually told from the point of view of a child. They typically involve adult villains who hate and mistreat children, and feature at least one &quot;good&quot; adult to counteract the villain(s). These stock characters are possibly a reference to the abuse that Dahl stated that he experienced in the boarding schools he attended. In a biography of Dahl, Matthew Dennison wrote that &quot;his writing frequently included protests against unfairness&quot;. Dahl&#x27;s books see the triumph of the child; children&#x27;s book critic Amanda Craig said, &quot;He was unequivocal that it is the good, young and kind who triumph over the old, greedy and the wicked.&quot; Anna Leskiewicz in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s often suggested that Dahl&#x27;s lasting appeal is a result of his exceptional talent for wriggling his way into children&#x27;s fantasies and fears, and laying them out on the page with anarchic delight. Adult villains are drawn in terrifying detail, before they are exposed as liars and hypocrites, and brought tumbling down with retributive justice, either by a sudden magic or the superior acuity of the children they mistreat.&quot;

While his whimsical fantasy stories feature an underlying warm sentiment, they are often juxtaposed with grotesque, darkly comic and sometimes harshly violent scenarios. &quot;The Witches&quot;, &quot;George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine&quot; and &quot;Matilda&quot; are examples of this formula. &quot;The BFG&quot; follows, with the good giant (the BFG or &quot;Big Friendly Giant&quot;) representing the &quot;good adult&quot; archetype and the other giants being the &quot;bad adults&quot;. This formula is also somewhat evident in Dahl&#x27;s film script for &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;. Class-conscious themes also surface in works such as &quot;Fantastic Mr Fox&quot; and &quot;Danny, the Champion of the World&quot; where the unpleasant wealthy neighbours are outwitted.

Dahl also features characters who are very fat, usually children. Augustus Gloop, Bruce Bogtrotter and Bruno Jenkins are a few of these characters, although an enormous woman named Aunt Sponge features in &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; and the nasty farmer Boggis in &quot;Fantastic Mr Fox&quot; is an enormously fat character. All of these characters (with the possible exception of Bruce Bogtrotter) are either villains or simply unpleasant gluttons. They are usually punished for this: Augustus Gloop drinks from Willy Wonka&#x27;s chocolate river, disregarding the adults who tell him not to, and falls in, getting sucked up a pipe and nearly being turned into fudge. In &quot;Matilda&quot;, Bruce Bogtrotter steals cake from the evil headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, and is forced to eat a gigantic chocolate cake in front of the school; when he unexpectedly succeeds at this, Trunchbull smashes the empty plate over his head. In &quot;The Witches&quot;, Bruno Jenkins is lured by the witches (whose leader is the Grand High Witch) into their convention with the promise of chocolate, before they turn him into a mouse. Aunt Sponge is flattened by a giant peach. When Dahl was a boy his mother used to tell him and his sisters tales about trolls and other mythical Norwegian creatures, and some of his children&#x27;s books contain references or elements inspired by these stories, such as the giants in &quot;The BFG&quot;, the fox family in &quot;Fantastic Mr Fox&quot; and the trolls in &quot;The Minpins&quot;.

Receiving the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, Dahl encouraged his children and his readers to let their imagination run free. His daughter Lucy stated &quot;his spirit was so large and so big he taught us to believe in magic.&quot; She said her father later told her that if they had simply said goodnight after a bedtime story, he assumed it wasn&#x27;t a good idea. But if they begged him to continue, he knew he was on to something, and the story would sometimes turn into a book.

Dahl was also famous for his inventive, playful use of language, which was a key element to his writing. He invented over 500 new words by scribbling down his words before swapping letters around and adopting spoonerisms and malapropisms. The lexicographer Susan Rennie stated that Dahl built his new words on familiar sounds, adding:

As marketing director of Penguin Books in the 1980s, Barry Cunningham travelled the UK with Dahl on a promotional book tour, during which he asked Dahl what the secret of his success was, with Dahl responding, &quot;the thing you&#x27;ve got to remember, is that humour is delayed fear, laughter is delayed fear.&quot; Cunningham later recollected, &quot;if you look at the way he uses humour and the way that children use humour, perhaps sometimes it&#x27;s the only weapon they have against terrifying circumstances or people. That&#x27;s very indicative of his stories and the style of those stories.&quot;

A UK television special titled &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Revolting Rule Book&quot; which was hosted by Richard E. Grant and aired on 22 September 2007, commemorated Dahl&#x27;s 90th birthday and also celebrated his impact as a children&#x27;s author in popular culture. It also featured eight main rules he applied on all his children&#x27;s books:
# Just add chocolate
# Adults can be scary
# Bad things happen
# Revenge is sweet
# Keep a wicked sense of humour
# Pick perfect pictures
# Films are fun...but books are better!
# Food is fun!

In 2016, marking the centenary of Dahl&#x27;s birth, Rennie compiled &quot;The Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary&quot; which includes many of his invented words and their meaning. Rennie commented that some of Dahl&#x27;s words have already escaped his world, for example, &quot;Scrumdiddlyumptious&quot;: &quot;Food that is utterly delicious&quot;. In his poetry, Dahl gives a humorous re-interpretation of well-known nursery rhymes and fairy tales, parodying the narratives and providing surprise endings in place of the traditional happily-ever-after. Dahl&#x27;s collection of poems, &quot;Revolting Rhymes&quot;, is recorded in audiobook form, and narrated by actor Alan Cumming.

===Screenplays===
For a brief period in the 1960s, Dahl wrote screenplays. Two, the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; and &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, were adaptations of novels by Ian Fleming. Dahl also began adapting his own novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, which was completed and rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl failed to meet deadlines, and produced as the film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971). Dahl later disowned the film, saying he was &quot;disappointed&quot; because &quot;he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie&quot;. He was also &quot;infuriated&quot; by the deviations in the plot devised by David Seltzer in his draft of the screenplay. This resulted in his refusal for any more versions of the book to be made in his lifetime, as well as an adaptation for the sequel &quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot;.

He wrote the script for a film that began filming but was abandoned, &quot;Death, Where is Thy Sting-a-ling-ling?&quot;.

===Influences===
A major part of Dahl&#x27;s literary influences stemmed from his childhood. In his younger days, he was an avid reader, especially awed by fantastic tales of heroism and triumph. He met his idol, Beatrix Potter, when he was six years old. His other favourite authors included Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray and former Royal Navy officer Frederick Marryat, and their works made a lasting mark on his life and writing. He named Marryat&#x27;s &quot;Mr Midshipman Easy&quot; as his favourite novel. Joe Sommerlad in &quot;The Independent&quot; writes, &quot;Dahl&#x27;s novels are often dark affairs, filled with cruelty, bereavement and Dickensian adults prone to gluttony and sadism. The author clearly felt compelled to warn his young readers about the evils of the world, taking the lesson from earlier fairy tales that they could stand hard truths and would be the stronger for hearing them.&quot;

Dahl was also influenced by Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. The &quot;Drink Me&quot; episode in &quot;Alice&quot; inspired a scene in Dahl&#x27;s &quot;George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine&quot; where a tyrannical grandmother drinks a potion and is blown up to the size of a farmhouse. Finding too many distractions in his house, Dahl remembered the poet Dylan Thomas had found a peaceful shed to write in close to home. Dahl travelled to visit Thomas&#x27;s hut in Carmarthenshire, Wales in the 1950s and, after taking a look inside, decided to make a replica of it to write in. Appearing on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in October 1979, Dahl named Thomas &quot;the greatest poet of our time&quot;, and as one of his eight chosen records selected Thomas&#x27;s reading of his poem &quot;Fern Hill&quot;.

Dahl liked ghost stories, and claimed that &quot;Trolls&quot; by Jonas Lie was one of the finest ghost stories ever written. While he was still a youngster, his mother, Sofie Dahl, related traditional Norwegian myths and legends from her native homeland to Dahl and his sisters. Dahl always maintained that his mother and her stories had a strong influence on his writing. In one interview, he mentioned: &quot;She was a great teller of tales. Her memory was prodigious and nothing that ever happened to her in her life was forgotten.&quot; When Dahl started writing and publishing his famous books for children, he included a grandmother character in &quot;The Witches&quot;, and later said that she was based directly on his own mother as a tribute.

===Television===
In 1961, Dahl hosted and wrote for a science fiction and horror television anthology series called &quot;Way Out&quot;, which preceded the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; series on the CBS network for 14 episodes from March to July. One of the last dramatic network shows shot in New York City, the entire series is available for viewing at The Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles. He also wrote for the satirical BBC comedy programme &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, which was hosted by David Frost.

The British television series, &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, originally aired on ITV between 1979 and 1988. The series was released to tie in with Dahl&#x27;s short story anthology of the same name, which had introduced readers to many motifs that were common in his writing. The series was an anthology of different tales, initially based on Dahl&#x27;s short stories. The stories were sometimes sinister, sometimes wryly comedic and usually had a twist ending. Dahl introduced on camera all the episodes of the first two series, which bore the full title &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Tales of the Unexpected&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Roald Dahl died on 23 November 1990, at the age of 74 of a rare cancer of the blood, myelodysplastic syndrome, in Oxford, and was buried in the cemetery at the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, England. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; was titled &quot;Death silences Pied Piper of the macabre&quot;. According to his granddaughter, the family gave him a &quot;sort of Viking funeral&quot;. He was buried with his snooker cues, some very good burgundy, chocolates, HB pencils and a power saw. Today, children continue to leave toys and flowers by his grave.

In 1996, the Roald Dahl Children&#x27;s Gallery was opened at the Buckinghamshire County Museum in nearby Aylesbury. The main-belt asteroid 6223 Dahl, discovered by Czech astronomer Antonín Mrkos, was named in his memory in 1996.

In 2002, one of Cardiff Bay&#x27;s modern landmarks, the Oval Basin plaza, was renamed &quot;Roald Dahl Plass&quot;. &quot;Plass&quot; is Norwegian for &quot;place&quot; or &quot;square&quot;, alluding to the writer&#x27;s Norwegian roots. There have also been calls from the public for a permanent statue of him to be erected in Cardiff. In 2016, the city celebrated the centenary of Dahl&#x27;s birth in Llandaff. Welsh Arts organisations, including National Theatre Wales, Wales Millennium Centre and Literature Wales, came together for a series of events, titled Roald Dahl 100, including a Cardiff-wide City of the Unexpected, which marked his legacy.

Dahl&#x27;s charitable commitments in the fields of neurology, haematology and literacy during his life have been continued by his widow since his death, through Roald Dahl&#x27;s Marvellous Children&#x27;s Charity, formerly known as the Roald Dahl Foundation. The charity provides care and support to seriously ill children and young people throughout Britain. In June 2005, the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre in the author&#x27;s home village Great Missenden was officially opened by Cherie Blair, wife of then British Prime Minister Tony Blair, to celebrate the work of Roald Dahl and advance his work in literacy education. Over 50,000 visitors from abroad, mainly from Australia, Japan, the United States and Germany, travel to the village museum every year.

In 2008, the UK charity Booktrust and Children&#x27;s Laureate Michael Rosen inaugurated The Roald Dahl Funny Prize, an annual award to authors of humorous children&#x27;s fiction. On 14 September 2009 (the day after what would have been Dahl&#x27;s 93rd birthday) the first blue plaque in his honour was unveiled in Llandaff. Rather than commemorating his place of birth, however, the plaque was erected on the wall of the former sweet shop (and site of &quot;The Great Mouse Plot of 1924&quot;) that features in the first part of his autobiography &quot;Boy&quot;. It was unveiled by his widow Felicity and son Theo. In 2018, Weston-super-Mare, the town described by Dahl as a &quot;seedy seaside resort&quot;, unveiled a blue plaque dedicated to him, on the site of the since-demolished boarding school Dahl attended, St Peter&#x27;s. The anniversary of Dahl&#x27;s birthday on 13 September is celebrated as &quot;Roald Dahl Day&quot; in Africa, the United Kingdom and Latin America.

In honour of Dahl, the Royal Gibraltar Post Office issued a set of four stamps in 2010 featuring Quentin Blake&#x27;s original illustrations for four of the children&#x27;s books written by Dahl during his long career; &quot;The BFG&quot;, &quot;The Twits&quot;, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, and &quot;Matilda&quot;. A set of six commemorative Royal Mail stamps was issued in 2012, featuring Blake&#x27;s illustrations for &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;The Witches&quot;, &quot;The Twits&quot;, &quot;Matilda&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Mr Fox&quot;, and &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;. Dahl&#x27;s influence has extended beyond literary figures. For instance, the film director Tim Burton recalled from childhood &quot;the second layer [after Dr. Seuss] of connecting to a writer who gets the idea of the modern fable—and the mixture of light and darkness, and not speaking down to kids, and the kind of politically incorrect humour that kids get. I&#x27;ve always like that, and it&#x27;s shaped everything I&#x27;ve felt that I&#x27;ve done.&quot; Steven Spielberg read &quot;The BFG&quot; to his children when they were young, stating the book celebrates the fact that it&#x27;s OK to be different as well as to have an active imagination: &quot;It&#x27;s very important that we preserve the tradition of allowing young children to run free with their imaginations and magic and imagination are the same thing.&quot; Actress Scarlett Johansson named &quot;Fantastic Mr Fox&quot; one of the five books that made a difference to her.


Regarded as &quot;one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century&quot;, Dahl was named by &quot;The Times&quot; one of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. He ranks amongst the world&#x27;s best-selling fiction authors with sales estimated at over 300 million, and his books have been published in 63 languages. In 2000, Dahl topped the list of Britain&#x27;s favourite authors. In 2003, four books by Dahl, led by &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; at number 35, ranked among the Top 100 in &quot;The Big Read&quot;, a survey of the British public by the BBC to determine the &quot;nation&#x27;s best-loved novel&quot; of all time. In surveys of British teachers, parents and students, Dahl is frequently ranked the best children&#x27;s writer. He won the first three Australian BILBY Younger Readers Award; for &quot;Matilda&quot;, &quot;The BFG&quot;, and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. In a 2006 list for the Royal Society of Literature, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; creator J. K. Rowling named &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; one of her top ten books every child should read. Critics have commented on the similarities between the Dursley family from &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and the nightmarish guardians seen in many of Dahl&#x27;s books, such as Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker from &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, Grandma from &quot;George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine&quot;, and the Wormwoods from &quot;Matilda&quot;. Barry Cunningham, who as publisher of Bloomsbury signed Rowling, cited his experiences travelling with Dahl in promotional book tours of the UK as helping him see the potential of Rowling&#x27;s work, stating, &quot;I think it was because I didn&#x27;t come from a traditional background. I&#x27;d come from marketing and promotion. I&#x27;d seen how children relate to books&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Matilda&quot; was ranked number 30 among all-time best children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with primarily US audience. The Top 100 included four books by Dahl, more than any other writer. The American magazine &quot;Time&quot; named three Dahl books in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time, more than any other author. Dahl is one of the most borrowed authors in British libraries.

In 2012, Dahl was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life he most admires. In 2016 Dahl&#x27;s enduring popularity was proved by his ranking in Amazon&#x27;s the top five best-selling children&#x27;s authors on the online store over the last year, looking at sales in print and on the Kindle store. In a 2017 UK poll of the greatest authors, songwriters, artists and photographers, Dahl was named the greatest storyteller of all time, ranking ahead of Dickens, Shakespeare, Rowling and Spielberg. In 2017, the airline Norwegian announced Dahl&#x27;s image would appear on the tail fin one of their Boeing 737-800 aircraft. He is one of the company&#x27;s six &quot;British tail fin heroes&quot;, joining Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, England World Cup winner Bobby Moore, novelist Jane Austen, pioneering pilot Amy Johnson and aviation entrepreneur Freddie Laker.

In September 2021, Netflix acquired the Roald Dahl Story Company in a deal worth more than £500 million ($686 million). A film adaptation of &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot; was released by Netflix and Sony Pictures Releasing in December 2022, and the cast includes Emma Thompson as Miss Trunchbull. The next Dahl adaptation for Netflix, &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot;, was released in September 2023, with its director Wes Anderson also adapting three additional Dahl short stories for Netflix in 2024.

== Criticism and controversies ==

===Opposition to Israel and antisemitic comments===
Dahl reviewed Australian author Tony Clifton&#x27;s &quot;God Cried&quot;, a picture book about the siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War. The article appeared in the August 1983 issue of the &quot;Literary Review&quot; and was the subject of much media comment and criticism at the time. According to Dahl, until this point in time &quot;a race of people&quot;, meaning Jews, had never &quot;switched so rapidly from much-pitied victims to barbarous murderers&quot;. The empathy of all after the Holocaust had turned &quot;into hatred and revulsion&quot;. Dahl wrote that Clifton&#x27;s book would make readers &quot;violently anti-Israeli&quot;, saying, &quot;I am not anti-Semitic. I am anti-Israel.&quot; He asked, &quot;must Israel, like Germany, be brought to her knees before she learns how to behave in this world?&quot;. The United States, he said, was &quot;so utterly dominated by the great Jewish financial institutions&quot; that &quot;they dare not defy&quot; Israelis.

Following the &quot;Literary Review&quot; article, Dahl told a journalist from the &quot;New Statesman&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity, maybe it&#x27;s a kind of lack of generosity towards non-Jews. I mean there is always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn&#x27;t just pick on them for no reason.&quot; In 1990, during an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Dahl explained that his issue with Israel began when they invaded Lebanon in 1982:

Responding in 1990 to a journalist from &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, whom he considered rude, he said, &quot;I am an old hand at dealing with you buggers.&quot; Jeremy Treglown, in his 1994 biography, writes of Dahl&#x27;s first novel &quot;Sometime Never&quot; (1948), &quot;plentiful revelations about Nazi anti-Semitism and the Holocaust did not discourage him from satirising &#x27;a little pawnbroker in Hounsditch called Meatbein who, when the wailing started, would rush downstairs to the large safe in which he kept his money, open it and wriggle inside on to the lowest shelf where he lay like a hibernating hedgehog until the all-clear had gone&#x27;.&quot; In a short story entitled &quot;Madame Rosette&quot;, the eponymous character is termed &quot;a filthy old Syrian Jewess&quot;.

Dahl had Jewish friends, including the philosopher Isaiah Berlin, who commented, &quot;I thought he might say anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. He was a man who followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak.&quot; Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, says, &quot;This is again an example of how Dahl refused to take anything seriously, even himself. He was very angry at the Israelis. He had a childish reaction to what was going on in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner. His publisher was a Jew, his agent was a Jew... and he thought nothing but good things of them. He asked me to be his managing director, and I&#x27;m Jewish.&quot;

In 2014, the Royal Mint decided not to produce a coin to commemorate the centenary of Dahl&#x27;s birth, saying that it considered him to be &quot;associated with antisemitism and not regarded as an author of the highest reputation&quot;. In 2020, Dahl&#x27;s family published a statement on the official Roald Dahl website apologising for his antisemitism. The statement says, &quot;The Dahl family and the Roald Dahl Story Company deeply apologise for the lasting and understandable hurt caused by some of Roald Dahl&#x27;s statements. Those prejudiced remarks are incomprehensible to us and stand in marked contrast to the man we knew and to the values at the heart of Roald Dahl&#x27;s stories, which have positively impacted young people for generations. We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his absolute worst, Roald Dahl can help remind us of the lasting impact of words.&quot; The apology was received with appreciation by some Jewish groups but not others. The Campaign Against Antisemitism, for example, said that, &quot;For his family and estate to have waited thirty years to make an apology, apparently until lucrative deals were signed with Hollywood, is disappointing and sadly rather more comprehensible.&quot;

=== Use of stereotypes ===
In 1972, Eleanor Cameron, also a children&#x27;s book author, published an article in &quot;The Horn Book&quot; criticising &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; for being self-referentially hypocritical: Cameron also took issue with Dahl&#x27;s depiction of the African-derived Oompa-Loompas, who &quot;have never been given the opportunity of any life outside of the chocolate factory&quot;, and suggested that teachers look for better literature to use in the classroom. In 1973, Dahl posted a reply, calling Cameron&#x27;s accusations &quot;insensitive&quot; and &quot;monstrous&quot;. &quot;The Horn Book&quot; published Cameron&#x27;s response, where she clarified that she intended her article not to be a personal attack on Dahl, but rather to point out that, although the book is a work of fiction, it still influences reality. Herein, she again objected to the characterization of the Oompa-Loompas, stating, &quot;[T]he situation of the Oompa-Loompas is real; it could not be more so, and it is anything but funny.&quot; The debate between the two authors sparked much discussion and a number of letters to the editor.

A 1991 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article echoed Cameron&#x27;s comments, with Michael Dirda writing, &quot;the Oompa-Loompas... reveal virtually every stereotype about blacks.&quot; Dirda&#x27;s article also discussed many of the other criticisms of Dahl&#x27;s writing, including his alleged sexism, of which Dirda wrote, &quot;&quot;The Witches&quot; verges on a general misogyny.&quot; In a 1998 article for &quot;Lilith&quot;, Michele Landsberg analysed the alleged issues in Dahl&#x27;s work and concluded that, &quot;Throughout his work, evil, domineering, smelly, fat, ugly women are his favorite villains.&quot;

In 2008, Una Mullally wrote an article for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; that described Dahl&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Switch Bitch&quot; as &quot;a collection better forgotten, laden with crude and often disturbing sexual fantasy writing&quot;. Nonetheless, Mullally argued that there are feminist messages in Dahl&#x27;s work, even if they may be obscured, &quot;&quot;The Witches&quot; offers up plenty of feminist complexities. The witches themselves are terrifying and vile things, and always women... The book is often viewed as sexist, but that assessment ignores one of the heroines of the story, the child narrator&#x27;s grandmother.&quot;

===2023 censorship revisions===

In 2023, Puffin Books, which holds the rights to all Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s books, ignited controversy after they hired sensitivity readers to go through the original text of Dahl&#x27;s works, which led to hundreds of revisions to his books; &quot;The Telegraph&quot; published a list of many of these changes. The move was supported by a number of authors, most notably by Joanne Harris, chair of the Society of Authors, and Diego Jourdan Pereira at &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot;, but drew many more critical responses. Several public figures, including then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and author Salman Rushdie, spoke out against the changes. It was reported that when Dahl was alive, he had spoken out very strongly against any changes ever being made to any of his books. On 23 February 2023, Puffin announced it would release an unedited selection of Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s books as &#x27;The Roald Dahl Classic Collection&#x27;, stating, &quot;We&#x27;ve listened to the debate over the past week which has reaffirmed the extraordinary power of Roald Dahl&#x27;s books&quot; and &quot;recognise the importance of keeping Dahl&#x27;s classic texts in print&quot;.

<text>The Addams Family is a fictional family created by American cartoonist Charles Addams. They originally appeared in a series of 150 standalone single-panel comics, about half of which were originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; between 1938 and their creator&#x27;s death in 1988. They have since appeared in other media, such as television, film, video games, comic books, a musical, and merchandise.

The Addams are an eccentric old-money clan who delight in the macabre and the grotesque and they are seemingly unaware or unconcerned that other people find them bizarre or frightening. The family members were unnamed until the 1960s. Matriarch Morticia and daughter Wednesday received their names when a licensed doll collection was released in 1962; patriarch Gomez and son Pugsley were named when the 1964 television series debuted. The Addams Family consists of Gomez and Morticia Addams, their children, Wednesday and Pugsley, and close family members Uncle Fester and Grandmama, their butler Lurch, and Pugsley&#x27;s pet octopus, Aristotle. The dimly seen Thing (later a disembodied hand) was introduced in 1954, and Gomez&#x27;s Cousin Itt, Morticia&#x27;s pet lion Kitty Kat and Morticia&#x27;s carnivorous plant Cleopatra in 1964. Pubert Addams, Wednesday and Pugsley&#x27;s infant brother, was introduced in the 1993 film &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;.

The live-action television series premiered on ABC on Friday, September 18, 1964, and ran for two seasons. It subsequently inspired a 1977 telefilm titled &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot; and cameos from the cast in other shows. An unrelated animated series aired in 1973.

The franchise was revived in the 1990s with a feature film series consisting of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991) and &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993). The films inspired a second animated series (1992–1993) which is set in the same fictional universe. The series was rebooted with a 1998 direct-to-video film and a spin-off live-action television series (1998–1999). In 2010, a live musical adaptation featuring Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth opened on Broadway to tepid reviews, but it was nominated for two Tony Awards and eight Drama Desk Awards, winning one Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Set Design. The series was rebooted again in 2019 with the animated film &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, which led to a sequel in 2021. In 2022, Netflix debuted the original series &quot;Wednesday&quot;, which is a spin-off from the original 1964 series.

The franchise has spawned a video game series, academic books and soundtracks, which are based around its Grammy-nominated theme song. A staple in pop culture for eight decades, The Addams Family has influenced American comics, cinema and television. The goth subculture and its fashion have also been influenced by The Addams Family.

==History==
===Origins and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; cartoons (1933–1964)===

Charles Addams began as a cartoonist in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; with a sketch of a window washer that ran on February 6, 1932. Addams first drew the then-unnamed Morticia some years before her first published appearance in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Some sources give a date of 1933, while Addams himself when asked in interview suggested &quot;around 1937.&quot; Media speculation at the time often connected Morticia to Charles Addams&#x27; first wife Barbara Jean Day, but he had yet to meet her. In an interview in 1981 he acknowledged that Morticia reflected the qualities he was attracted to. Because of this, the women he married later on resembled the character. He described Morticia as &quot;not patterned after anyone in particular, although I&#x27;ve often thought there was a little Gloria Swanson in her.&quot;

The first Addams Family cartoon was published in 1938, in a one-panel gag format. Charles Addams became a regular contributor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and drew approximately 1,300 cartoons between then and his death in 1988. 58 of these would feature the Addams Family, almost all of which were published in the 1940s and 1950s. Members of the family were introduced one by one, with Morticia first, Gomez (based on Thomas E. Dewey) joining four years later, Pugsley, and finally Wednesday and Fester shortly after. Addams indicated that Fester resembled himself, &quot;plus a little more hair.&quot; A Christmas 1946 strip, showing the family pouring boiling oil on carolers, was well received and was later sold on Christmas cards. Outside of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Addams also published several collections, the most notable being &quot;Dear Dead Days: A Family Album&quot; in 1959. 

In 1946, Addams briefly collaborated with science fiction writer Ray Bradbury, planning out an illustrated book about a supernatural family named &quot;The Elliotts&quot;, similar to &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. There was difficulty finding a publisher however, and the two went their separate ways. These stories were eventually anthologized in &quot;From the Dust Returned&quot; (2001), with a connecting narrative, an explanation of their collaboration, and the artwork Addams had created for the project in 1946.

Beginning in the early 1960s, the development of the television series affected the comics. For one, the family members did not have names until that time; Wednesday was first given a name in 1962 for a licensed doll collection, and the others were named ahead of the series&#x27; debut. Some suggestions from David Levy at NBC were introduced into the last comics of the era, including the addition of Thing and Cousin Itt. Itt was an invention of Levy&#x27;s, while Thing was an expansion on a disembodied hand that had appeared in a 1954 strip. The comics ceased publication in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1964, as the editor William Shawn banned the characters. He was concerned about the image of the publication, and did not want it associated with a mainstream sitcom. &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; called him &quot;snooty&quot; for the decision.

===TV adaptations and rise to popularity (1964–1977)===

In the early 1960s, NBC executive David Levy stumbled across one of Addams&#x27; books in a New York bookstore and realized that the tone would be perfect for television. He purchased the book and met with Addams in the Plaza Hotel, and the topic of a television adaptation was raised. Addams had been approached about television adaptations by others in the past, but he was inclined to take Levy up on the offer because of their shared friend in the author John O&#x27;Hara. At the next meeting, at Addams&#x27; apartment, Levy indicated the characters would need to be named, and Addams came up with a list for the third meeting. According to Levy, Addams had little involvement with the series after those three meetings. He retained the right to veto casting decisions and other choices, but did not make use of the power. Some rights to the franchise were given to Filmways, the production company for the show.

The 1964 television adaptation brought the series to a much wider audience and was well received publicly. Producer Nat Perrin took a &quot;less evil&quot; approach to the characters and stories than Addams had in the cartoons, emphasizing lighter, more comedic elements. Stephen Cox later described the series as &quot;more zany than spooky&quot;. Charles Addams himself was less happy with the series, criticising the characters for being &quot;half as evil&quot; as in the comics.

The popular series, broadcast on the ABC network, ran only two seasons. No official reason was given for the cancellation, though &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; speculated that it was due to the adoption of colour programming on the network the following year. It has also been suggested that competition with &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; in the same time slot on CBS was a factor.

The sudden cancellation in 1966 brought issues for Addams, as he faced a drop in income with the show no longer in development. His second wife Barbara Barb was a practicing lawyer who had engaged in &quot;diabolical legal scheming&quot; during their marriage, and had convinced Addams to sign over the rights to future television and film adaptations, as well as rights to some of his other cartoons. Following their divorce she remained in possession of these rights until 1991, when she sold them to allow development of the Sonnenfeld films. Addams could also no longer publish his comics in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as Shawn&#x27;s ban remained in effect even after the television series concluded. Addams became bitter towards the magazine &quot;for disowning his family&quot;. The franchise remained in the popular consciousness even after the series concluded, with the &quot;Lurch&quot; dance move remaining popular through the 1960s. The television series was often re-run through television syndication for years afterward, particularly in Australia.

Hanna-Barbera parodied the show in November 1964 by introducing a family named &quot;The Gruesomes&quot; to &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, and the Gruesomes appeared occasionally in &quot;Flintstones&quot; media into the early 1970s. The studio later animated a 1972 Addams Family crossover with Scooby-Doo, which led to a 1973 animated series. The animated incarnation featured a new cast except for Felix Silla, who returned as Cousin Itt. The show had good ratings and spawned a line of children&#x27;s merchandise, but only aired 16 episodes. A pilot was also produced that year for a new live action series entitled &quot;The Addams Family Funhouse&quot;, using a different cast. The pilot was aired in 1973 but never picked up for a full series.

A 1977 special, &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot;, reunited most of the original cast from the 1964 series, with Blossom Rock absent due to her health. The made-for-TV movie faced issues during production and was poorly received. It was shot using a house set that had been constructed for the horror film &quot;Ben&quot;, which didn&#x27;t resemble the original Addams mansion and caused technical issues with lighting. The film was widely criticised for the script, direction, and the performances of some of the actors. Jackie Coogan in particular was recovering from a mild stroke during filming.

===Wave of interest in Australia (1979–1989)===
While William Shawn&#x27;s ban on further &quot;Addams Family&quot; comics in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; persisted until 1987, Addams was able to sneak in several of the characters as a cameo in &quot;Z Line Subway&quot;, a 1979 strip. He married Marilyn Matthews Miller in 1981, in an Addams family themed ceremony conducted in a cemetery. Filmways, the production company of the 1964 series and holder of some franchise rights, was purchased in 1982 by Orion Pictures. The retirement of Shawn in 1987 allowed a brief return of the cartoons to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, though Addams died only a year later. While largely inactive in the United States, the franchise did however see a wave of popularity in Australia, brought on by widely watched reruns on TCN-9. New merchandise was released in Australia and a &quot;Morticia Boutique Dress Shop&quot; opened in Melbourne in 1988. A satellite-linked interview with surviving members of the original cast was also aired on Australian television. A fan quoted by Cox credited the tone of the Addams family for its success in 1980s Australia, noting that the characters were &quot;less American&quot; than the Munsters, and that Australians had a different life-style. Astin reprised his role as Gomez for a 1989 episode of Nick at Nite&#x27;s Sitcom Zone, in which he introduced reruns of shows for a two-hour programming block. A 1989 video game &quot;Fester&#x27;s Quest&quot; was developed by Sunsoft, and is now considered among the worst games of all time. To promote the game some black-and-white advertisements were filmed using the characters.

===Film series and &quot;The New Addams Family&quot; (1991–2001)===
The head of production at 20th Century Fox, Scott Rudin, pitched an Addams Family film but Fox did not have the rights to the franchise. The rights were at the time split between two parties: The late Addams&#x27; second wife Barbara Barb, and Orion Pictures. The latter were in possession of film rights in particular after purchasing Filmways in 1982. Fox attempted to purchase those rights but failed, as Orion had plans for a new TV series. The studio&#x27;s plans changed however after Barb sold her rights to Orion, and the studio brought Rudin on board to produce a film. Caroline Thompson and Larry Wilson wrote a script, and faced many re-writes early on. Tim Burton was considered for director, but the role ultimately went to Barry Sonnenfeld.
The film featured a new cast, Blossom Rock (Grandmama) having died in 1978, Ted Cassidy (Lurch) in 1979, Carolyn Jones (Morticia) in 1983 and Jackie Coogan (Fester) in 1984.
Production on the film was troubled, with Sonnenfeld blacking out on set, and a burst blood vessel in Raul Julia&#x27;s eye further delaying the shoot. Director of photography Owen Roizman quit the production three months from completion, forcing Sonnenfeld to take on the role in addition to his existing responsibilities. Orion faced financial issues and sold the project and Addams family rights to Paramount mid-production- though the deal did not include overseas home media rights, which harmed distribution after release. Orion retained those, and those rights passed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer when the studio was bought out in 1997.

While the 1991 film received mixed reviews from critics, it performed reasonably well at the box office despite its production issues. The film triggered a lawsuit from David Levy over its use of Thing and Cousin Itt, as Levy had been the creator of those characters ahead of the launch of the 1964 television series. The case was settled out of court and the resolution is not known publicly. A second film in 1993, &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; was highly regarded by critics but performed poorly at the box office unexpectedly, and earned less than half the revenue of its predecessor. This, and the sudden death of Julia in 1994, prevented Sonnenfeld from producing further films. Both films received nominations for Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, and Hugo Awards. For her role as Morticia, Anjelica Huston was twice nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and Raul Julia (as Gomez), Christina Ricci (as Wednesday), Christopher Lloyd (as Fester), and Joan Cusack (as Fester&#x27;s wife, Debbie Jellinsky, in the sequel) received multiple Saturn Award and American Comedy Award nominations for their portrayals.

Following the wave of interest in the franchise, a 1992 animated television series notably saw John Astin reprise his role as Gomez, almost thirty years after his first appearance in the role in 1964. It was nominated for four Daytime Emmy Awards, including one for Astin. That year a pinball machine based on the franchise was also released, featuring original voice acting from Julia and Huston as Gomez and Morticia. It went on to become the highest selling pinball machine of all time at over 20,000 units.

A direct-to-video film, &quot;The Addams Family Reunion&quot; produced by Saban Entertainment in 1998, featured the return of Carel Struycken as Lurch, but was otherwise unrelated to the Sonnenfeld films. It was very poorly received. The film was intended as the pilot for a Canadian-produced live-action television series, &quot;The New Addams Family&quot;, made with a mostly different cast and airing the following year. Astin, then in his late 60s, returned as Grandpapa Addams in the TV series, rather than Gomez, who was played by Glenn Taranto. The show concluded after a single season in 1999. A video game adaptation of &quot;The New Addams Family&quot; was released in 2001 for the Game Boy Color.

===Musical and animated adaptations (2007–2021)===
In 2007, Elephant Eye Theatrical announced that they had obtained the rights to a musical adaptation of the comic series, which at that time were held by the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation. After a try-out in Chicago in 2009, the musical was performed on Broadway in 2010, and thereafter in a sequence of international tours until 2021.

The rights to the franchise were purchased by Illumination Entertainment in 2010, and the studio shortly announced a Tim Burton stop-motion led film. However, Burton withdrew from the project in 2013 over a decision to use computer animation rather than stop motion as he had intended. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired the remaining rights and announced a computer animated film the same year, and entered into production in the late 2010s. Unlike the Burton version, this would use 3D computer animation. The film was eventually released in 2019, to a moderate box-office sales and mixed reception. A sequel, released in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, was far less successful and poorly received critically.

=== &quot;Wednesday&quot; (2022–present) ===

Miles Millar and Alfred Gough began work on a live action spin off series entitled &quot;Wednesday&quot; in 2019, financed by MGM. The writers room for the series took place during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and so was conducted remotely. The project was formally announced in 2020, with Burton as executive producer. The first series was released in 2022 to critical acclaim. Amazon purchased MGM in 2021, which in turn means that the Addams Family rights now rest with the company.

==Premise and background==
:Gomez and Pugsley are enthusiastic. Morticia is even in disposition, muted, witty, sometimes deadly. Grandma Frump is foolishly good-natured. Wednesday is her mother&#x27;s daughter. A closely-knit family, the real head being Morticia – although each of the others is a definite character – except for Grandma, who is easily led. Many of the troubles they have as a family are due to Grandma&#x27;s fumbling, weak character. The house is a wreck, of course, but this is a house-proud family just the same, and every trap door is in good repair. Money is no problem.

The family appears to be a branch of an extensive Addams clan, with relatives all over the world. In the original television series they are said to be related to &quot;those one-D Adamses&quot;, a fact the family are deeply ashamed of. According to the film version, the family credo is, &quot;&quot; (pseudo-Latin: &quot;We gladly feast on those who would subdue us&quot;). Charles Addams was first inspired by his hometown of Westfield, New Jersey, an area full of ornate Victorian mansions and archaic graveyards. In the original comics series they live in a &#x27;gothic&#x27; house on Cemetery Ridge. According to the television series, the residence is a gloomy mansion adjacent to a cemetery and a swamp located in an unspecified American town. In the musical (first shown in Chicago in 2009), the house is located in Central Park. In the 2019 film, the Addamses live in an abandoned asylum located in the outskirts of the state of New Jersey which is haunted by a disembodied resident who demands the property to remain undisturbed.

Although most of the humor derives from the fact that they share macabre interests, such as putting each other and themselves in the way of bodily harm (none of which seems to have any effect), the television Addamses are not evil. They are a close-knit extended family. Morticia is an exemplary mother, and she and Gomez remain passionate towards each other; as established in the television series: She occasionally fondly calls him &quot;bubbeleh&quot;, to which he responds by kissing her arms, behavior which Morticia can also provoke by speaking a few words in French (their meanings are not important; any words in French will do). The parents are supportive of their children (except in the 2019 film when Wednesday arrives home wearing a pink dress). The family is friendly and hospitable to visitors; in some cases, it is willing to donate large sums of money to causes (television series and films), despite the visitors&#x27; horror at the Addamses&#x27; peculiar lifestyle. The characters were unnamed until the advent of the 1964 television adaptation, except for Wednesday and Morticia who were first named for a 1962 licensed doll collection.

==Adaptations==
===Television===
====&quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1964–1966)====
In 1964, the ABC TV network created &quot;The Addams Family&quot; television series based on Addams&#x27;s cartoon characters. The series was shot in black-and-white and aired for two seasons in 64 half-hour episodes (September 18, 1964 – September 2, 1966). During the original television run of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; television series, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; editor William Shawn refused to publish any &quot;Addams Family&quot; cartoons. However, he continued to publish other Charles Addams cartoons. Shawn regarded his magazine as targeting a more refined readership and he did not want it to be associated with characters who could be seen on television by the more general public. After Shawn&#x27;s 1987 retirement, the characters were welcomed back to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

====&quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; (1972)====
The Addams Family&#x27;s first animated appearance was on the third episode of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo Meets the Addams Family&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Wednesday is Missing&quot;), which first aired on CBS Saturday morning, on September 23, 1972. Four members of the original cast (John Astin, Carolyn Jones, Jackie Coogan, and Ted Cassidy) returned for the special, which involved the Addamses in a mystery with the Scooby-Doo gang. The Addams Family characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. After the episode aired, fans wanted more animated adventures featuring the Addamses, and Hanna-Barbera obliged.

====&quot;The Addams Family Fun-House&quot; (1973)====
In late 1972, ABC produced a pilot for a live-action musical variety show which was titled &quot;The Addams Family Fun-House&quot;. The cast included Jack Riley and Liz Torres as Gomez and Morticia (the pair also co-wrote the special), Stubby Kaye as Uncle Fester, Pat McCormick as Lurch and Butch Patrick (who had played Eddie Munster on &quot;The Munsters&quot;) as Pugsley. Felix Silla reprised his role as Cousin Itt, connecting it to the original TV series. The pilot aired in 1973, but it was not picked up for a series.

====&quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1973)====

The first animated series ran on Saturday mornings from September 8 –
December 22, 1973 on NBC. In a departure from the original series, this series took the Addamses on the road in a Victorian-style RV. This series also marked the point where the relationships between the characters were changed so that Fester was now Gomez&#x27;s brother, and Grandmama was now Morticia&#x27;s mother (though the old relationships between the characters would be revisited in the 1977 television movie, in order to retain its continuity with the original sitcom). Although Coogan and Cassidy reprised their roles as Uncle Fester and Lurch, Astin and Jones did not; their parts were recast with Hanna-Barbera voice talents Lennie Weinrib as Gomez and Janet Waldo as Morticia, while a ten-year-old Jodie Foster provided the voice of Pugsley. Again, the characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. The show also had appearances from Thing, Cousin Itt, Kitty Kat and Cleopatra from the original series. The show also introduces new Addams Family&#x27;s animal companions, such as Ali the alligator, Ocho the octopus and Mr. V the vulture. One season was produced, and the second season consisted of reruns. The show&#x27;s theme music was completely different and it had no lyrics and no finger snaps, although it retained a bit of the four-note score from the live-action show.

=====&quot;The Addams Family Comic Book&quot;=====
From 1974 to 1975, Gold Key Comics produced a comic book series in connection with the show, but it only lasted three issues. Each issue was adapted from a TV episode, starting with &quot;In Search of the Boola-Boola&quot; (October 1974).

====&quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot; (1977)====

A television reunion movie, &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot;, aired on NBC on Sunday, October 30, 1977. It features most of the original cast, except Blossom Rock, who had played Grandmama. She was still alive but was very ill at the time; Jane Rose replaced her. Veteran character actors Parley Baer and Vito Scotti, who both had recurring roles on the original series, also appeared in the movie. The movie has a slightly different version of the theme song; the finger snaps are used but not the lyrics.

Gomez and Morticia have had two more children, Wednesday Jr. and Pugsley Jr., who strongly resemble their older siblings. Gomez&#x27;s brother, Pancho, is staying with the family while Gomez attends a lodge meeting in Tombstone, Arizona. Gomez is jealous of his brother, who once courted Morticia. Halloween is nigh, and Pancho tells the children the legend of the Great Pumpkin-like character of Cousin Shy, who distributes gifts and carves pumpkins for good children on Halloween night. Wednesday (now called &quot;Wednesday, Sr.&quot;) is home from music academy, where she is studying the piccolo (breaking glass with it). Pugsley (now &quot;Pugsley, Sr.&quot;) is home from Nairobi medical school, where he is training to be a witch doctor. The family&#x27;s home has been bugged by a gang of crooks which intends to steal the family&#x27;s fortune. Lafferty, the boss, sends a gang member named Mikey into the house to investigate. Mikey panics and flees after treading on the tail of Kitty Kat the lion. The crooks employ a fake Gomez and Morticia to help them carry out their plans, along with two strong-arm goons, Hercules and Atlas. Gomez returns home to celebrate the Halloween party and trim the scarecrow. Lafferty poses as Quincy Addams (from Boston) to gain entrance to the house during the party. He has his men tie up Gomez and Morticia, and his doubles take their places, confusing Pancho, who is still in love with Morticia, and Ophelia, who is still in love with Gomez. Gomez and Morticia escape (thanks to the &quot;Old Piccolo Game&quot;), and rejoin the party, only to have Lafferty use various methods to try to get rid of them. Lurch scares off the thugs and terrifies Lafferty&#x27;s other assistant. Fester, trying to be nice, puts Lafferty on the rack. Lafferty tries to escape through the secret passage and steps on Kitty Kat&#x27;s tail. When the police arrive, the crooks gladly surrender. The Addamses are then free to celebrate Halloween happily, ending the night by singing together in welcome for Cousin Shy.

====&quot;The Addams Family: The Animated Series&quot; (1992–1993)====

The remake series ran on Saturday mornings from 1992 to 1993 on ABC after producers realized the success of the 1991 &quot;Addams Family&quot; movie. This series returned to the familiar format of the original series, with the Addams Family facing their sitcom situations at home. John Astin returned to the role of Gomez, and celebrities Rip Taylor and Carol Channing took over the roles of Fester and Grandmama, respectively. Veteran voice actors Jim Cummings, Debi Derryberry, Jeannie Elias and Pat Fraley did the voices of Lurch, Wednesday, Pugsley and Cousin Itt, respectively. New artistic models of the characters were used for this series, though still having a passing resemblance to the original cartoons. Two seasons were produced, with the third year containing reruns. Oddly in this series, Wednesday maintained her macabre, brooding attitude from the Addams Family movies. Still, her facial expressions and body language conveyed the happy-go-lucky, fun attitude of her portrayal in the original television show. The original Vic Mizzy theme song, although slightly different, was used for the opening.

====&quot;The New Addams Family&quot; (1998–1999)====

&quot;The New Addams Family&quot; was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and ran for 65 episodes (one more than the original TV series) during the 1998–1999 season on the then-newly launched Fox Family Channel. Many storylines from the original series were reworked for this new series, incorporating more modern elements and jokes. John Astin returned to the franchise in some episodes of this series, albeit as &quot;Grandpapa&quot; Addams (Gomez&#x27;s grandfather, a character introduced in &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot;). The cast included Glenn Taranto as Gomez Addams, Ellie Harvie as Morticia, Michael Roberds as Fester, Brody Smith as Pugsley, Nicole Fugere (the only cast member from &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot; to return) as Wednesday, John DeSantis as Lurch, Betty Phillips as Grandmama and Steven Fox as Thing.

==== &quot;Wednesday&quot; (2022) ====

In 2021, Netflix announced a live-action TV series adaptation based on Wednesday Addams, produced by MGM Television and starring Jenna Ortega as the title character. Alfred Gough and Miles Millar were the showrunners and Tim Burton directed several episodes in his first televised directorial effort. Wednesday, a student at Nevermore Academy, solves mysteries using her psychic ability. These include murders and a 25-year-old mystery involving her family. Luis Guzmán stars as Gomez, and Catherine Zeta-Jones stars as Morticia. In addition, Fred Armisen appears as Uncle Fester, George Burcea as Lurch, Victor Dorobantu as Thing, and Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley. Hunter Doohan, Georgie Farmer, Moosa Mostafa, Emma Myers, Naomi J. Ogawa, Joy Sunday, Percy Hynes White, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane and Gwendoline Christie were also added to the cast as series regulars. In March 2022, Christina Ricci, who portrayed Wednesday in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991) and &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), joined the cast as a series regular.

===Feature films===

====&quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991)====

In the 1990s, Orion Pictures (which by then had inherited the rights to the series) developed a film version, &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (released on November 22, 1991). Because of the studio&#x27;s financial troubles at the time, Orion sold the US rights to the film to Paramount Pictures. On October 1, 2019, Paramount Pictures released double feature of &quot;Addams Family&quot; and &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; on Blu-ray in the United States.

====&quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993)====

Upon the last film&#x27;s success, a sequel followed: &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (released on November 19, 1993, with worldwide distribution by Paramount). Loosened content restrictions allowed the films to use far more grotesque humor that strove to keep the Addams cartoons&#x27; original spirit (in fact, several gags were lifted straight from the single-panel cartoons). The two films used the same cast, except for Grandmama, played by Judith Malina and Carol Kane in the first and second films, respectively. A script for a third film was prepared in 1994, but was abandoned after the sudden death of actor Raul Julia that year.

====&quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot; (1998)====

Another film, &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot;, was released direct-to-video on September 22, 1998, this time by Warner Bros. through its video division. It has no relation to the Paramount movies, being in fact a full-length pilot for a second live-action television version, &quot;The New Addams Family&quot;, produced and shot in Canada. The third movie&#x27;s Gomez, played by Tim Curry, follows the style of Raul Julia, while the new sitcom&#x27;s Gomez, played by Glenn Taranto, is played in the style of John Astin, who had played the character in the 1960s. The only actors in this Warner Bros./Saban Entertainment production to have played in the previous Paramount films were Carel Struycken as Lurch and Christopher Hart as Thing.

====Cancelled film====
In 2010, it was announced that Illumination Entertainment, in partnership with Universal Pictures, had acquired the underlying rights to the Addams Family drawings. The film was planned to be a stop-motion animated film based on Charles Addams&#x27;s original drawings. Tim Burton was set to co-write and co-produce the film, with a possibility to direct. In July 2013 however, it was reported that the film was cancelled.

====&quot;The Addams Family&quot; (2019) and &quot;The Addams Family 2&quot; (2021)====

On October 31, 2013, it was announced in &quot;Variety&quot; that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer will be reviving The Addams Family as an animated film with Pamela Pettler to write the screenplay and Andrew Mittman and Kevin Miserocchi to executive produce the film and they were in final negotiations with BermanBraun&#x27;s Gail Berman and Lloyd Braun to produce it. By October 2017, Conrad Vernon had been hired to direct the film, which he will also produce along with Berman and Alex Schwartz, based on a screenplay written by Pettler, with revisions by Matt Lieberman. The film was released on October 11, 2019. On October 8, 2020, MGM announced that a sequel is in the works with an announcement trailer. The original cast set to return. Bill Hader and Javon &quot;Wanna&quot; Walton have also been cast to voice. Bill Hader played a new character named Dr. Cyrus Strange, while Javon replaced Finn Wolfhard as the voice of Pugsley Addams. Directors Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon returned as directors. The film was released on October 1, 2021.

===Books===
====&quot;The Addams Family&quot;====
This first novelisation of the television series, written by Jack Sharkey, was released near the end of the show&#x27;s second season. The book details the family&#x27;s arrival in their new home and explains how it got its bizarre décor. The arrival and origins of Thing are explained. Each chapter reads as a self-contained story, like episodes of the television show. The novel concludes with the Addams family discovering that their lives will be the basis for a new television series. It was published in paperback by Pyramid Books in 1965.

====&quot;The Addams Family Strikes Back&quot;====
&quot;The Addams Family Strikes Back&quot; by W.F. Miksch tells how Gomez plans to rehabilitate the image of Benedict Arnold by running for the local school board. The tone and characterizations in this book resemble the TV characters much more closely than in the first novel. Cousin Itt appears as a minor character in this story, but as a tiny, three-legged creature rather than the hairy, derby-hatted character seen on television and in the movies. The novel was published in paperback form by Pyramid Books in 1965.

====&quot;The Addams Family: An Evilution&quot;====

&quot;The Addams Family: An Evilution&quot; is a book about the &quot;evilution&quot; of The Addams Family characters, with more than 200 published and previously unpublished cartoons, and includes text by Charles Addams and H. Kevin Miserocchi, Director of the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation. Pomegranate Press published the book in 2010.

===Advertising===
In 1994, the actors cast as the Addamses in the first two films (sans the recently deceased Raul Julia) were in several Japanese television spots for the Honda Odyssey. The Addamses are seen speaking Japanese—most prominently Gomez (for whom a voice actor was used to impersonate Julia while footage from &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; was seen) and Morticia.

In 2007 and 2008, the Addams Family appeared as M&amp;M&#x27;s in an advertising campaign for M&amp;M&#x27;s Dark Chocolate.

===Soundtrack===
A theme song for the 1964 TV series as well as a soundtrack album the next year were released, both composed by Vic Mizzy and the latter containing all of his compositions for the series entitled &quot;Original Music From The Addams Family&quot;.

===Musical===
====&quot;The Addams Family&quot;====

In May 2007, it was announced that a musical inspired by The Addams Family drawings by Charles Addams was being developed for the Broadway stage. Broadway veterans Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice wrote the book, and Andrew Lippa wrote the score. Julian Crouch and Phelim McDermott (Improbable theatre founders) directed and designed the production, with choreography by Sergio Trujillo. A workshop and private industry presentation was held August 4–8, 2008. Featured in the cast were Bebe Neuwirth as Morticia, Krysta Rodriguez as Wednesday, and Nathan Lane as Gomez. In addition, Kevin Chamberlin played Uncle Fester and Zachary James played Lurch.

The musical opened in previews at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on Broadway on March 8, 2010, with an official opening on April 8, after an out-of-town tryout in Chicago at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts from November 13, 2009, to January 10, 2010. The cast includes Lane as Gomez, Neuwirth as Morticia, Terrence Mann as Mal Beineke, Carolee Carmello as Alice Beineke, Chamberlin as Uncle Fester, Jackie Hoffman as Grandma, Zachary James as Lurch, Krysta Rodriguez as Wednesday, and Wesley Taylor as Wednesday&#x27;s love interest, Lucas Beineke. The Broadway production ran for 22 months, closing on December 31, 2011, after 35 previews and 722 performances.

On September 5, 2016, it was announced that the musical would premiere in the UK, on a major UK and Ireland tour produced by James Yeoburn and Stuart Matthew Price for United Theatrical. The production was directed by Matthew White and it opened at Edinburgh Festival Theatre on April 20, 2017, starring Samantha Womack, Les Dennis and Carrie Hope Fletcher.

==Cast and characters==
:


==Legacy==
The family has had a profound influence on American comics, cinema and television, and it has also been seen as an inspiration for the goth subculture and its fashion. According to &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, the Addamses &quot;are one of the most iconic families in American history, up there with the Kennedys&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Time&quot; has compared &quot;the relevance and the cultural reach&quot; of the family with those of the Kennedys and the Roosevelts, &quot;so much a part of the American landscape that it&#x27;s difficult to discuss the country&#x27;s history without mentioning them&quot;. For &quot;TV Guide&quot;, which listed the characters in the top ten of the &quot;60 greatest TV families of all time&quot;, the Addamses &quot;provid[ed] the design for cartoonish clans to come, like the Flintstones and the Simpsons&quot;. Owing to their popularity, the first feature-length adaptation has been identified as a &quot;cult film&quot;, while &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; was listed as one of the &quot;50 best family films&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s &#x27;100 Years ... 100 Laughs&#x27; at the turn of the century. Ricci&#x27;s portrayal of Wednesday in the film series was ranked one of the &quot;100 greatest movie characters&quot; by &quot;Empire&quot;, and in 2011 AOL named Morticia one of the &quot;100 most memorable female TV characters&quot;.

<text>Charles Samuel Addams (January 7, 1912 – September 29, 1988) was an American cartoonist known for his darkly humorous and macabre characters. Some of his recurring characters became known as the Addams Family, and were subsequently popularized through various adaptations.

==Early life==
Addams was born in Westfield, New Jersey. He was the son of Grace M. (née Spear; 1879–1943) and Charles Huey Addams (1873–1932), a piano company executive who had studied to be an architect. Known as &quot;something of a rascal around the neighborhood,&quot; as childhood friends recalled, Addams was distantly related to U.S. presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, despite the different spellings of their last names, and was a first cousin twice removed to noted social reformer Jane Addams.

Addams would enjoy the Presbyterian Cemetery on Mountain Avenue in Westfield as a child, where – according to author and Addams expert Ron MacCloskey – he would wonder what it was like to be dead. In the cartoons, his ghoulish creations lived on Cemetery Ridge with a dreadful view.

A house on Elm Street and another on Dudley Avenue – into which police once caught him breaking and entering – are said to be the inspiration for the Addams Family mansion in his cartoons. College Hall, the oldest building on the current campus of the University of Pennsylvania, where Addams studied, was also an inspiration for the mansion. One friend said of him: &quot;His sense of humor was a little different from everybody else&#x27;s.&quot; He was also artistically inclined, &quot;drawing with a happy vengeance&quot;, according to a biographer.
His father encouraged him to draw, and Addams did cartoons for the Westfield High School yearbook, &quot;Weathervane&quot;. He attended Colgate University in 1929 and 1930. At the corners of West Kendrick and Maple Avenues in Hamilton, is another home, and myth, that may have inspired the Addams Family house. He also attended the University of Pennsylvania in 1930 and 1931. He then studied at the Grand Central School of Art in New York City in 1931 and 1932.

==Career==
Charles Addams joined the layout department of &quot;True Detective&quot; magazine in 1933, where he retouched photos of corpses to remove the blood for appearance alongside magazine stories. Addams complained: &quot;A lot of those corpses were more interesting the way they were.&quot;

The New Yorker Obituary of October 17, 1988, says his first drawing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; ran in February 1932. However, his first drawing actually appeared in the February 4, 1933, issue. Here he drew the first in the series that came to be called &quot;The Addams Family&quot; in August 6, 1938 and ran regularly until his death. Addams remained a freelancer throughout that time.

During World War II, Addams served at the Signal Corps Photographic Center in New York, where he made animated training films for the U.S. Army.

Addams created a 1952 mural for the library at Penn State depicting prominent Addams Family members.

Television producer David Levy approached Addams with an offer to create &quot;The Addams Family&quot; television series, with a little help from the humorist. Addams gave his characters names as well as qualities for actors to use in portrayals; the series ran on ABC from 1964 to 1966.

===Cartoons===
Addams regularly had cartoons in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and he also created the syndicated single-panel comic &quot;Out of This World&quot; between 1955 and 1957. Collections of his work include &quot;Drawn and Quartered&quot; (1942) and &quot;Monster Rally&quot; (1950), the latter with a foreword by John O&#x27;Hara. One cartoon shows two men standing in a patent attorney&#x27;s office; one points a bizarre gun out the window toward the street, saying: &quot;Death ray, fiddlesticks! Why, it doesn&#x27;t even slow them up!&quot;.

&quot;Dear Dead Days&quot; (1959) is a scrapbook-like compendium of vintage images (and occasional pieces of text) that appealed to the author&#x27;s sense of the grotesque, including Victorian woodcuts, vintage medicine-show advertisements, and a boyhood photograph of Francesco Lentini, who had three legs.

Addams drew more than 1,300 cartoons over the course of his life. Beyond &quot;The New Yorker&quot; pages, his cartoons appeared in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;TV Guide&quot;, as well as books, calendars, and other merchandise.

The 1957 album &quot;Ghost Ballads&quot;, featuring folk songs with supernatural themes by singer-guitarist Dean Gitter, was packaged with cover art by Addams depicting a haunted house.

The Mystery Writers of America honored Addams with a Special Edgar Award in 1961 for his body of work. The films &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1963) and &quot;Murder by Death&quot; (1976) feature title sequences illustrated by Addams.

In 1946, Addams met science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury after having drawn an illustration for &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine&#x27;s publication of Bradbury&#x27;s short story &quot;Homecoming&quot;, the first in a series of tales chronicling a family of Illinois vampires named the Elliotts. The pair became friends and planned to collaborate on a book of the Elliott Family&#x27;s complete history with Bradbury writing and Addams providing the illustrations, but it never materialized. Bradbury&#x27;s stories about the &quot;Elliott Family&quot; were finally anthologized in &quot;From the Dust Returned&quot; in October 2001, with a connecting narrative and an explanation of his work with Addams, and Addams&#x27;s 1946 &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; illustration used for the book&#x27;s cover jacket. Although Addams&#x27;s own characters were well-established by the time of their initial encounter, in a 2001 interview, Bradbury stated: &quot;[Addams] went his way and created the Addams Family, and I went my own way and created my family in this book.&quot;

Janet Maslin, in a review of an Addams biography for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;Addams&#x27;s persona sounds cooked up for the benefit of feature writers ... was at least partly a character contrived for the public eye,&quot; noting that one outré publicity photo showed the humorist wearing a suit of armor at home, &quot;but the shelves behind him hold books about painting and antiques, as well as a novel by John Updike.&quot;

Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock was a friend of Addams, and owned two pieces of original Addams art. Hitchcock references Addams in his 1959 film &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. During the auction scene, Cary Grant discovers two of his adversaries with someone who he also thinks is against him and says: &quot;The three of you together. Now that&#x27;s a picture only Charles Addams could draw.&quot;

==Personal life==
Addams met first wife Barbara Jean Day in late 1943, who purportedly resembled his cartoon character Morticia Addams. The marriage ended eight years later after Addams declined to have children (she later married &quot;New Yorker&quot; colleague John Hersey, author of the book &quot;Hiroshima&quot;).

Addams married second wife Barbara Barb (Estelle B. Barb) in 1954. A practicing lawyer, she &quot;combined Morticia-like looks with diabolical legal scheming,&quot; by which she wound up controlling the &quot;Addams Family&quot; television and film franchises and persuaded her husband to give away other legal rights. At one point, she got her husband to take out a US$100,000 insurance policy. Addams consulted a lawyer on the sly, who later humorously wrote: &quot;I told him the last time I had word of such a move was in a picture called &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; starring Barbara Stanwyck, which I called to his attention.&quot; In the movie, Stanwyck&#x27;s character plotted her husband&#x27;s murder. The couple divorced in 1956.

Addams was &quot;sociable and debonair&quot;. A biographer described him as being &quot;a well-dressed, courtly man with silvery back-combed hair and a gentle manner, he bore no resemblance to a fiend&quot;. Figuratively a &quot;&quot;, Addams accompanied women such as Greta Garbo, Joan Fontaine, and Jacqueline Kennedy on social occasions. For about a year after the death of Nelson Rockefeller, Addams dated Megan Marshack, the aide who was with the former US vice president when he died.

Addams married his third and final wife Marilyn Matthews Miller, best known as &quot;Tee&quot; (1926–2002), in a pet cemetery. The Addamses moved to Sagaponack, New York in 1985, where they named their estate &quot;The Swamp&quot;.

===Death===
Addams died on September 29, 1988, at the age of 76, at St. Clare&#x27;s Hospital and Health Center in New York City, having suffered a heart attack after parking his automobile. An ambulance took him from his apartment to the hospital, where he died in the emergency room. As he had requested, a wake was held rather than a funeral; he had wished to be remembered as a &quot;good cartoonist&quot;. In accordance with Addams&#x27;s wishes, he was cremated, and his ashes were interred in the pet cemetery of &quot;The Swamp&quot; estate.

==Legacy==
The Tee &amp; Charles Addams foundation was established in 1999 &quot;to interpret and share the artistic achievement of Charles Addams’s life through exhibitions and programs developed from all works by Charles Addams including the Foundation’s own collections and from its copyrights of the Addams oeuvre.&quot; Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the foundation offered tours of the couples&#x27; property and displayed artefacts from Addams&#x27; life.

The Charles Addams Fine Arts Hall in Philadelphia was named in his tribute by the University of Pennsylvania in 2001.

On the occasion of his 100th birthday, January 7, 2012, Charles Addams was honored with a Google Doodle.

Addams was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2020.

On April 30, 2021, the original art for his macabre holiday illustration &quot;Addams and Evil&quot;, a 1947 interior book cartoon from &quot;The Addams Family Christmas&quot;, sold for $87,500, the author&#x27;s world auction record, over seven times initial estimates.

<doc id="55494" wikidata="Q204128" url="?curid=55494" title="Bábism">
<text>Bábism (), also known as the Bábí Faith, is a messianic movement founded in 1844 by the Báb ( &#x27;Ali Muhammad). The Báb, an Iranian merchant-turned-prophet, professed that there is one incorporeal, unknown, and incomprehensible God who manifests His will in an unending series of theophanies, called Manifestations of God. The Báb&#x27;s ministry, throughout which there was much evolution as he progressively outlined his teachings, was turbulent and short-lived and ended with his public execution in Tabriz in 1850. A campaign of extermination followed, in which thousands of followers were killed in what has been described as potentially one of the bloodiest actions of the Qajar Iranian military in the 19th century.

According to current estimates, Bábism has no more than a few thousand adherents, most of whom are concentrated in Iran, but it has persisted into the modern era in the form of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, to which the majority of Bábís eventually converted.

Bábism flourished in Iran until 1852, then lingered on in exile in the Ottoman Empire, especially Cyprus, as well as underground in Iran. An anomaly amongst Islamic messianic movements, the Bábí movement signaled a break with Shia Islam, beginning a new religious system with its own unique laws, teachings, and practices. While Bábism was violently opposed by both clerical and government establishments, it led to the founding of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, whose followers consider the religion founded by the Báb as a predecessor to their own. Bahá&#x27;í sources maintain that the remains of the Báb were clandestinely rescued by a handful of Bábis and then hidden. Over time the remains were secretly transported according to the instructions of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh and then &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá through Isfahan, Kermanshah, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut, and then by sea to Acre on the plain below Mount Carmel in 1899. On 21 March 1909, the remains were interred in a special tomb, the Shrine of the Báb, erected for this purpose by &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, on Mount Carmel in present-day Haifa, Israel.

==Etymology==
The name Báb () is a reference to the gate to the Twelfth Imam.

&quot;Bábism&quot;, a term originating from Orientalists rather than the followers of the religion, comes from the Arabic noun &quot;gate&quot; (). Additionally, comes from the Semitic root ب ي ن, which forms a class of words relating to concepts of clarity, differentiation, and separation, including , which can refer to explanation, commentary, or exposition as well as the branch of Arabic rhetoric dealing with metaphors and interpretation.

==History==

===Antecedents===
Twelver Shia Muslims regard the Twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, as the last of the Imams. They contend that Muhammad al-Mahdi went into the Occultation in 874 CE, at which time communication between the Imam and the Muslim community could only be performed through mediators called (&#x27;gates&#x27;) or (&#x27;representatives&#x27;). In 940, the fourth claimed that Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi had gone into an indefinite &quot;Major Occultation&quot;, and that he would cease to communicate with the people. According to Twelver belief, the Hidden Imam is alive in the world, but in concealment from his enemies, and will only emerge shortly before the Last Judgment. At that time, acting as Qa&#x27;im Al Muhammad (&quot;He who will arise&quot;), a messianic figure also known as the Mahdi (&quot;He who is rightly guided&quot;), the Hidden Imam will start a holy war against evil, would defeat the unbelievers, and would start a reign of justice.

In 1830s Qajar Persia, Kazim Rashti was the leader of the Shaykhis, a sect of Twelvers. The Shaykhis were a group expecting the imminent appearance of al-Qāʾim. At the time of Kazim&#x27;s death in 1843, he had counselled his followers to leave their homes to seek the Lord of the Age whose advent would soon break on the world.

===Origin===
On 22 May 1844, Mullá Husayn, of Boshruyeh in Khorasan, a prominent disciple of Sayyid Kāẓim, entered Shiraz following the instruction by his master to search for al-Qā&#x27;im. Soon after he arrived in Shiraz, Mullá Husayn came into contact with the Báb. On the night of 22 May 1844, Mulla Husayn was invited by the Báb to his home; on that night Mullá Husayn told him that he was searching for the possible successor to Sayyid Kāẓim, al-Qā&#x27;im, and the Báb told Mullá Husayn privately that he was Sayyid Kāẓim&#x27;s successor and the bearer of divine knowledge. Through the night of the 22nd to dawn of the 23rd, Mullá Husayn became the first to accept the Báb&#x27;s claims as the gateway to Truth and the initiator of a new prophetic cycle; the Báb had replied in a satisfactory way to all of Mullá Husayn&#x27;s questions and had written in his presence, with extreme rapidity, a long commentary on the surah of Yusuf, which has come to be known as the Qayyūmu l-Asmā&#x27; and is often considered the Báb&#x27;s first revealed work, though he had before then composed a commentary on Surat al-Fatihah and Surat al-Baqara. This night and the following day are observed in the Bahá&#x27;í Faith as a holy day since then.

After Mullá Husayn accepted the Báb&#x27;s claim, the Báb ordered him to wait until 17 others had independently recognized the station of the Báb before they could begin teaching others about the new revelation.

Within five months, seventeen other disciples of Sayyid Kāẓim had independently recognized the Báb as a Manifestation of God. Among them was one woman, Zarrin Tāj Baraghāni, a poet, who later received the name of Táhirih (the Pure). These 18 disciples were later to be known as the Letters of the Living and were given the task of spreading the new faith across Iran and Iraq. The Báb emphasized the spiritual station of these 18 individuals, who along with himself, made the first &quot;Unity&quot; of his religion.

After his declaration, he soon assumed the title of the Báb. Within a few years the movement spread all over Iran, causing controversy. His claim was at first understood by some of the public at the time to be merely a reference to the Gate of the Hidden Imám of Muhammad, but this understanding he publicly disclaimed. He later proclaimed himself, in the presence of the heir to the Throne of Persia and other notables, to be al-Qā&#x27;im. In the Báb&#x27;s writings, the Báb appears to identify himself as the gate () to Muhammad al-Mahdi and later he begins to explicitly proclaim his station as equivalent to that of the Hidden Imam and a new messenger from God. Saiedi states the exalted identity the Báb was claiming was unmistakable, but due to the reception of the people, his writings appear to convey the impression that he is only the gate to the Hidden Twelfth Imam. To his circle of early believers, the Báb was equivocal about his exact status, gradually confiding in them that he was not merely a gate to the Hidden Imam, but the Manifestation of the Hidden Imam and al-Qā&#x27;im himself. During his early meetings with Mullá Husayn, the Báb described himself as the Master and the Promised One; he did not consider himself just Sayyid Kāẓim Rashti&#x27;s successor, but claimed a prophetic status, with a sense of deputyship delegated to him not just from the Hidden Imam, but from Divine authority. His early texts, such as the Commentary on the Sura of Yusuf, used Qur&#x27;anic language that implied divine authority and identified himself effectively with the Imam. When Mullā ʿAlī Basṭāmī, the second Letter of the Living, was put on trial in Baghdad for preaching about the Báb, the clerics studied the Commentary on the Sura of Yusuf, recognized in it a claim to divine revelation, and quoted from it extensively to prove that the author had made a messianic claim.

===Spread===
The Báb&#x27;s message was disseminated by the Letters of the Living through Iran and southern Iraq. One of these initial activities was communicated to the West starting 8 January 1845 as an exchange of diplomatic reports concerning the fate of Mullá ʿAli-e Bastāmi, the second Letter. These were exchanges between Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet who wrote first to Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe. Followups continued until in 1846 he was sentenced by the Ottomans to serve in the naval shipyards at hard labor—the Ottoman ruler refusing to banish him as it would be &quot;difficult to control his activities and prevent him spreading his false ideas.&quot; Separately each of the Letters and other early believers were sent on various missions to begin public presentations of the new religion. Indeed various activities the Báb initiated were devolved to various Letters of the Living like preaching activities and answering questions from the community. In particular, as these first public activities multiplied, opposition by the Islamic clergy arose and prompted the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb&#x27;s arrest. The Báb, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in June 1845 and presented himself to the authorities. This series of events become the first public account of the new religion in the West when they were published 1 November 1845 in &quot;The Times&quot; of London. The story was also carried from 15 November by the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; which was subsequently echoed widely. Meanwhile the Báb was placed under house arrest at the home of his uncle, and was restricted in his personal activities, until a cholera epidemic broke out in the city in September 1846.

The Báb was released and departed for Isfahan. There, many came to see him at the house of the imám jum&#x27;ih, head of the local clergy, who became sympathetic. After an informal gathering where the Báb debated the local clergy and displayed his speed in producing instantaneous verses, his popularity soared. After the death of the Governor of Isfahan, Manouchehr Khan Gorji, an Iranian Georgian, who had become his supporter, pressure from the clergy of the province led to the Shah, Mohammad Shah Qajar, ordering the Báb to Tehran in January 1847. After spending several months in a camp outside Tehran, and before the Báb could meet the Shah, the Prime Minister sent the Báb to Tabriz in the northwestern corner of the country, and later Maku and Chehriq, where he was confined. During his confinement, he was said to have impressed his jailers with his patience and dignity. Communication between the Báb and his followers was not completely severed but was quite difficult, and more responsibilities were devolved to the &quot;Letters&quot; as he was not able to elucidate his teachings to the public. With Bábí teachings now mostly spread by his followers, they faced increasing persecution themselves.

The role played by Táhirih in Karbalāʾ was particularly significant. She began an effort of innovation in religion based on her station as a Letter of the Living and the incarnation of Fatimah. In his early teachings, the Báb emphasized observing sharia and extraordinary acts of piety. However, his claim of being the Báb, i.e. the authority direct from God, was in conflict with this more conservative position of supporting sharia. Táhirih innovated an advance in the understanding of the priority of the Báb&#x27;s station above that of Islamic sharia by wedding the concept of the Báb&#x27;s overriding religious authority with ideas originating in Shaykhism pointing to an age after outward conformity. She seems to have made this connection /1846 even before the Báb himself. The matter was taken up by the community at large at the Conference of Badasht.

This conference was one of the most important events of the Bábí movement when in 1848 its split from Islam and Islamic law was made clear. Three key individuals who attended the conference were Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, Quddús, and Táhirih. Táhirih, during the conference, was able to persuade many of the others about the Bábí split with Islam based on the station of the Báb and an age after outward conformity. She appeared at least once during the conference in public without a veil, heresy within the Islamic world of that day, signalling the split. During this same month the Báb was brought to trial in Tabriz and made his claim to be the Mahdi public to the Crown Prince and the Shi&#x27;a clergy.

Several sources agree that by 1848 or 1850 there were 100,000 converts to Babism. In the fall of 1850 newspaper coverage fell behind quickly unfolding events. Though the Báb was named for the first time he had in fact already been executed.

===Uprisings and massacres===
By 1848 the increased fervour of the Bábís and the clerical opposition had led to a number of confrontations between the Bábís and their government and clerical establishment. After the death of Mohammad Shah Qajar, the shah of Iran, a series of armed struggles and uprisings broke out in the country, including at Tabarsi. These confrontations all resulted in Bábí massacres; Bahá&#x27;í authors give an estimate of 20,000 Bábís killed from 1844 to present, with most of the deaths occurring during the first 20 years. The first major killings of Bábís recorded in history took place in Qazvin. Since then, attacks against the Bábís by prominent clerics and their followers became more common and some Bábís started to carry arms. In remote and isolated places the scattered Bábís were readily attacked and killed while in places where large numbers of them resided they acted in self-defense. One of these attacks occurred in Babol of Mazandaran which led to the death of several Bábís and their opponents, as well as an armed conflict between Bábís and their enemies in fort Ṭabarsí. After that, two other big clashes between the Bábís and their opponents took place in the cities of Zanjan and Neyriz in the north and south of Iran, respectively, as well as a smaller conflict in Yazd. A total of several thousand Bábís were killed in these conflicts. In the three main conflicts in Ṭabarsí, Zanjan and Neyriz, Bábís were accused by their enemies of revolting against the government. However, it seems unlikely that these actions were purely revolutionary. In all three cases, the battles that took place were of a defensive nature, and not considered an offensive jihad, as the Báb did not allow it and in the case of two urban conflicts (Neyriz and Zanjan), they were related to pre-existing social and political tensions within the towns. There is also no evidence of a coordinated plan of action. Wilson suggests that the Bábí uprisings were deliberate and that their clashes with authority were sometimes extremely brutal to respond to the tactics of the supporters of government. In mid-1850 a new prime-minister, Amir Kabir, was convinced that the Bábí movement was a threat and ordered the execution of the Báb which was followed by the killings of many Bábís.

====Fort Tabarsi====

Of the conflicts between the Bábís and the establishment, the first and best known took place in Māzandarān at the remote shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi, about southeast of Bārfarush (modern Babol). From October 1848 until May 1849, around 300 Bábís (later rising to 600), led by Quddús and Mullá Husayn, defended themselves against the attacks of local villagers and members of the Shah&#x27;s army under the command of Prince Mahdi Qoli Mirza. They were, after being weakened through attrition and starvation, subdued through false promises of safety, and put to death or sold into slavery.

====Zanjan upheaval====
The revolt at the fortress of ʿAli Mardan Khan in Zanjan in northwest Iran was by far the most violent of all the conflicts. It was headed by Mullā Muhammad &#x27;Ali Zanjani, called Hujjat, and also lasted seven or eight months (May 1850–January 1851). The Bábí community in the city had swelled to around 3,000 after the conversion of one of the town&#x27;s religious leaders to the Bábí movement. The conflict was preceded by years of growing tension between the leading Islamic clergy and the new rising Bábí leadership. The city governor ordered that the city be divided into two sectors, with hostilities starting soon thereafter. The Bábís faced resistance against a large number of regular troops, and led to the death of several thousand Bábís. After Hujjat was killed, and the Bábí numbers being greatly reduced, the Bábís surrendered in January 1851 and were massacred by the army.

====Nayriz upheaval====
Meanwhile, a serious but less protracted struggle was waged against the government at Neyriz in Fars by Yahya Vahid Darabi of Nayriz. Vahid had converted around 1500 people in the community and had thus caused tensions with the authorities which led to an armed struggle in a nearby fort. The Bábís resisted attacks by the town&#x27;s governor as well as further reinforcements. After being given a truce offer on 17 June 1850, Vahid told his followers to give up their positions, which led to Vahid and the Bábís being killed; the Bábí section of the town was also plundered, and the property of the remaining Bábís seized. Later, in March 1853 the governor of the city was killed by the Bábís. These further events led to a second armed conflict near the city where the Bábís once again resisted troop attacks until November 1853, when a massacre of Bábís happened, with their women being enslaved.

===After the execution of the Báb===

The revolts in Zanjan and Nayriz were in progress when in 1850 the Báb, with one of his disciples, was brought from his prison at Chehriq citadel, which was called , meaning &#x27;mount extreme&#x27;, by the Báb, to Tabriz and publicly shot in front of the citadel. The body, after being exposed for some days, was recovered by the Bábís and conveyed to a shrine near Tehran, whence it was ultimately removed to Haifa, where it is now enshrined.

Most Western scholars who reviewed the Faith of the Báb after 1860 saw it as a way of letting in Western and Christian ideals into &quot;a closed and rigid Moslem system&quot; and gave the Báb himself sometimes less or more credit for being authentic in the process. However, some went further. In 1866 British diplomat Robert Grant Watson (1834–1892) published a history of the first 58 years of the 19th century of Persia and would serve in several diplomatic capacities. Watson summarizes the impact of the Báb in Persia:

Latter commentators also noted these kinds of views: Ernest Renan, Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch, son of Charles Bulfinch, and others.

For the next two years comparatively little was heard of the Bábís. The Bábís became polarized with one group speaking of violent retribution against Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, while the other, under the leadership of Baha&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, looked to rebuild relationships with the government and advance the Babí cause by persuasion and the example of virtuous living.

The militant group of Bábís was between thirty and seventy persons, only a small number of the total Bábí population of perhaps 100,000. Their meetings appear to have come under the control of a &quot;Husayn Jan&quot;, an emotive and magnetic figure who obtained a high degree of personal devotion to himself from the group. Meanwhile, Tahirih and Baha&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, visible leaders of the community previously, were removed from the scene – Tahirih by arrest and in the case of Baha&#x27;u&#x27;lláh an invitation to go on pilgrimage to Karbila. On 15 August 1852, three from this small splinter group, acting on their own initiative, attempted to assassinate Naser al-Din Shah Qajar as he was returning from the chase to his palace at Niavarān. Notwithstanding the assassins&#x27; claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, and a slaughter of several thousand Bábís followed, starting on 31 August 1852 with some thirty Bábís, including Táhirih. Dr Jakob Eduard Polak, then the Shah&#x27;s physician, was an eye-witness to her execution. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh surrendered himself and he along with a few others were imprisoned in the Siāhchāl (&#x27;Black Pit&#x27;), an underground dungeon in Tehran. Meanwhile, echoes of the newspaper coverage of the violence continued into 1853.

===Bahá&#x27;í–Azali split===
In most of his prominent writings, the Báb alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot;, and that he himself was &quot;but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest.&quot; Within 20 years of the Báb&#x27;s death, over 25 people claimed to be the Promised One, most significantly Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh.

Shortly before the Báb&#x27;s execution, a follower of the Báb, Abd al-Karim, brought to the Báb&#x27;s attention the necessity to appoint a successor; thus the Báb wrote a certain number of tablets which he gave to Abd al-Karim to deliver to Subh-i Azal and Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. These tablets were later interpreted by both Azalis and Bahá&#x27;ís as proof of the Báb&#x27;s delegation of leadership. &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá stated that the Báb did this at the suggestion of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. In one of the tablets, which is commonly referred to as the Will and Testament of the Báb, Subh-i Azal is viewed to have been appointed as leader of the Bábís after the death of the movement&#x27;s founder; the tablet, in verse 27, orders Subh-i Azal &quot;...to obey Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest.&quot; At the time of the apparent appointment Subh-i Azal was still a teenager, had never demonstrated leadership in the Bábí movement, and was still living in the house of his older brother, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. All of this lends credence to the Bahá&#x27;í claim that the Báb appointed Subh-i Azal the head of the Bábí Faith so as to divert attention away from Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, while allowing Bábís to visit Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh and consult with him freely, and allowing Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh to write Bábís easily and freely.

Subh-i Azal&#x27;s leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the Bábí community spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; and even went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb on several occasions. Subh-i Azal gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the Bábís who started to give their alliance to other claimants. During the time that both Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh and Subh-i-Azal were in Baghdad, since Subh-i Azal remained in hiding, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh performed much of the daily administration of the Bábí affairs.

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh claimed that in 1853, while a prisoner in Tehran, he was visited by a &quot;Maid of Heaven&quot;, which symbolically marked the beginning of his mission as a Messenger of God. Ten years later in Baghdad, he made his first public declaration to be &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot; to a small number of followers, and in 1866 he made the claim public. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s claims threatened Subh-i Azal&#x27;s position as leader of the religion since it would mean little to be leader of the Bábís if &quot;Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest&quot; were to appear and start a new religion. Subh-i-Azal responded by making his own claims, but his attempt to preserve the traditional Bábism was largely unpopular, and his followers became the minority.

Eventually Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot; and his followers began calling themselves Bahá&#x27;ís. By 1908, there were probably from half a million to a million Bahá&#x27;ís, and at most only a hundred followers of Subh-i Azal. According to Ali Raza Naqavi, Bábism and the Bahá&#x27;í Faith are &quot;almost inseparable&quot; and have &quot;almost identical beliefs and doctrines.&quot; He writes that in the way Muslims view Judaism as having been abrogated by Christianity and Christianity as having been abrogated by Islam, Bahá&#x27;ís view Bábism as having been abrogated and replaced by the Bahá&#x27;í Faith.

Subh-i Azal died in Famagusta, Cyprus in 1912, and his followers are known as Azalis or Azali Bábis. Denis MacEoin notes that after the deaths of those Azali Babis who were active in the Persian Constitutional Revolution, the Azali form of Babism entered a stagnation from which it has not recovered as there is no acknowledged leader or central organization. Some few have coined the term Bayání faith though it died out in Cyprus. (Persian: , ).

In 2001, Azalis were estimated to number no more than a few thousand, living mainly in Iran.

==Beliefs and teachings==

The Báb&#x27;s teachings can be grouped into three broad stages which each have a dominant thematic focus. His earliest teachings are primarily defined by his interpretation of the Quran and other Islamic traditions. While this interpretive mode continues throughout all three stages of his teachings, a shift takes place where his emphasis moves to the philosophical elucidation and finally to legislative pronouncements. In the second philosophical stage, the Báb gives an explanation of the metaphysics of being and creation, and in the third legislative stage his mystical and historical principles are explicitly united. An analysis of the Báb&#x27;s writings throughout the three stages shows that all of his teachings were animated by a common principle that had multiple dimensions and forms.

===Hidden Imam===
In Twelver Shiʻa Islamic belief there were twelve Imams, the last of whom, known as Imam Mahdi, communicated with his followers only through certain representatives. According to the Twelver&#x27;s belief, after the last of these representatives died, the Imam Mahdi went into a state of Occultation; while still alive, he was no longer accessible to his believers. Shiʻa Muslims believe that when the world becomes oppressed, the Imam Mahdi (also termed the Qa&#x27;im) will come out of occultation and restore true religion on Earth before the cataclysmic end of the world and judgement day.

In Bábí belief the Báb is the return of the Imam Mahdi, but the doctrine of the Occultation is implicitly denied; instead the Báb stated that his manifestation was a symbolic return of the Imam, and not the physical reappearance of the Imam Mahdi who had died a thousand years earlier. In Bábí belief the statements made from previous revelations regarding the Imam Mahdi were set forth in symbols. The Báb also stated that he was not only the fulfillment of the Shiʻi expectations for the Qá&#x27;im, but that he also was the beginning of a new prophetic dispensation.

===Resurrection, Judgment Day and cyclical revelation===
The Báb taught that his revelation was beginning an apocalyptic process that was bringing the Islamic dispensation to its cyclical end, and starting a new dispensation. He taught that the terms &quot;resurrection&quot;, &quot;Judgement Day&quot;, &quot;paradise&quot; and &quot;hell&quot; used in Shiʻa prophecies for the end-times are symbolic. He stated that &quot;Resurrection&quot; means that the appearance of a new revelation, and that &quot;raising of the dead&quot; means the spiritual awakening of those who have stepped away from true religion. He further stated that &quot;Judgement Day&quot; refers to when a new Manifestation of God comes, and the acceptance or rejection of those on the Earth. Thus the Báb taught that with his revelation the end times ended and the age of resurrection had started and that the end-times were symbolic as the end of the past prophetic cycle. The Báb wrote: &quot;Verily, the world and the hereafter are two spiritual states. If you turn towards God, exalted be He, then you are in paradise and if you are occupied with your self then you are in hell and in the world. Therefore understand these allusions&quot;.

In the Persian Bayán, the Báb wrote that religious dispensations come in cycles, as the seasons, to renew &quot;pure religion&quot; for humanity. This notion of continuity anticipated future prophetic revelations after the Báb.

===He whom God shall make manifest===
One of the core Bábí teachings is that a new prophet would soon come, whom the Báb termed He whom God shall make manifest (, ), a messianic figure that would complete the revelation that the Báb begun. The Báb describes this messianic figure as the origin of all divine attributes, and states that his command is equivalent to God&#x27;s command. Unlike earlier religions in which references to future promised figures were occasional and only in hints and allusions, the entirety of the Bayan, the mother book of the Bábí dispensation, is essentially a discourse on a messianic figure, even greater than himself, that the Báb refers to as &quot;he Whom God shall make manifest&quot;. The Báb always discusses his own revelation and laws in the context of this promised figure. The essence and purpose of the Báb&#x27;s own mission, as he always stressed, was to prepare the people for the advent of him. He asks his followers to independently investigate and look for the promised one, and recognize him out of his own intrinsic reality, works and attributes, and not due to any reasons external to him. He even warns them not to be deprived of the promised one by arguing against him from the works of the Báb, the same way the followers of the previous religions opposed the next prophet while citing their holy scriptures. Furthermore, the Báb speaks of the imminence of the advent of the promised one and refers to the time of his advent as year nine and nineteen. After the Báb&#x27;s execution in 1850, there were some Bábis who claimed to be &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot;. Later in 1863, nineteen years after the declaration of the Báb, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh privately laid claim to be the messianic figure, and made his claim publicly in 1866–1868. His claim was by far the most successful. The majority of the Bábis followed him and later became known as Baháʼís. The Azalis (those Babis who did not accept Baháʼu&#x27;lláh) objected to Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s statement.

===Religious law===
The Báb abrogated Islamic law and in the &quot;Persian Bayán&quot; promulgated a system of Bábí law, thus establishing a separate religion distinct from Islam. Some of the new laws included changing the direction of the Qibla to the Báb&#x27;s house in Shiraz, Iran and changing the calendar to a solar calendar of nineteen months and nineteen days (which became the basis of the Baháʼí calendar) and prescribing the last month as a month of fasting. The Bab also prohibits confession and seeking forgiveness from anyone but God and His Manifestation.

In many respects, the Báb raised the status of women in his teachings. The Báb taught that, since God transcends the boundaries of male and female, God wishes that &quot;neither men exalt themselves over women, nor women exalt themselves over men&quot;. He instructs his followers to not mistreat women &quot;even for the blink of an eye&quot; and sets the penalty for causing grief to women as double that of causing grief to men. (Persian Bayān 7:18) He also encourages the education of women and does not display a gender distinction in Bábi laws on education. Armin Eschraghi notes the context of 19th century Iran and that, &quot;Modern western readers might not appreciate the revolutionary potential&quot; of the Báb&#x27;s teaching that &quot;Those who have been brought up in this community, men and women, are allowed to look [at each other], speak and sit together&quot; The Primal Will of God is also personified as the female figure of the Maid of Heaven. The Báb also foreshadowed later developments in media, by emphasising the need for a rapid system of news communication, which would be available for all to access, no matter their wealth or social standing. He writes, regarding the news, that &quot;until such a system is made universal, its benefit will not reach those servants of the kingdom unless there come a time when it will be accessible to all the people. Although today the kings have their own special couriers, this is fruitless, for the poor are deprived of such a service.&quot; Commenting on the extremes of wealth and poverty in society, the Báb also teaches that the true station of the rich should be as &quot;the depositories of God&quot; and enjoins generosity and charity. He says, &quot;Should ye find one stricken with poverty, enrich him to the extent of your ability ... should ye find one who is in distress, bring him tranquility by any means in your power&quot;.

Jack McLean, summarizing Baháʼí scholar Nader Saiedi&#x27;s analysis, writes that &quot;the Báb&#x27;s writings even foresee current global issues of crisis, such as the protection of the environment and the commodification of natural resources&quot; The Báb specifically calls for the absolute purity of water (Bayán 6:2). It may be easily deduced from this injunction that the environment must not be polluted since all substances return to the inland water table and the oceans. The Arabic Bayán (9:11) also forbids the commodification of the four elements, earth, air, fire and water.

The Báb also created a large number of other rituals, rites and laws. Some of these include the carrying of arms only in times of necessity, abstaining from smoking tobacco, the obligatory sitting on chairs, the advocating of the cleanliness displayed by Christians, the non-cruel treatment of animals, the prohibition of beating children severely, the recommendation of the printing of books, even scripture and the prohibition on the study of logic or dead languages, and abolishment of priesthood. Other laws include elaborate regulations regarding pilgrimage, fasting, the manufacture of rings, the use of perfume, and the washing and disposal of the dead.

Nader Saiedi states that the severe laws of the Bayán were never meant to be put in practice, because their implementation depended on the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest, while at the same time all of the laws would be abrogated unless the Promised One would reaffirm them. Saiedi concludes that these can then only have a strategic and symbolic meaning, and were meant to break through traditions and to focus the Báb&#x27;s followers on obedience to He whom God shall make manifest.

==Writings==
The Báb affirms that the verses revealed by a Manifestation of God are the greatest proof of His mission and the writings of the Báb comprise over two thousand tablets, epistles, prayers, and philosophical treatises. These writings form part of Baháʼí scripture, particularly his prayers, which are often recited individually as well as in devotional gatherings. 
The Báb&#x27;s major writings include the Qayyúmu&#x27;l-Asmáʼ (a commentary on the Sura of Joseph), and the Persian Bayán, which the Bábís saw as superseding the Qurʼan. The latter has been translated into French; only portions exist in English.

The works of the Báb have also excited scholarly interest and analysis. Elham Afnan describes the writings of the Báb as having &quot;restructured the thoughts of their readers, so that they could break free from the chains of obsolete beliefs and inherited customs&quot;. Jack McLean notes the novel symbolism of the Báb&#x27;s works, observing that &quot;The universe of the Báb&#x27;s sacred writings is pervasively symbolic. Numbers, colors, minerals, liquids, the human body, social relationships, gestures, deeds, language (letters and words), and nature itself are all mirrors or signs that reflect the profounder reality of the names and attributes (asmá va sifát) of God&quot;. Todd Lawson similarly identifies in the commentaries of the Báb an assertion of &quot;the potential and ultimate meaningfulness of all created things, from the highest to the lowest.&quot; The Báb&#x27;s works are characterised by linguistic innovation, including many neologisms whenever He found existing theological terms inadequate. Several scholars have identified the continual repetition of particular words or phrases of religious importance to be a distinct feature throughout the Bab&#x27;s writings. John Walbridge views the &quot;unquestionably hypnotic&quot; use of repetition in the Bab&#x27;s Kitab-i-Panj Sha&#x27;n, where &quot;the same evocative words are repeated ceaselessly&quot; with gradual variations over time, as anticipating a minimalist aesthetic as well as possibly prefiguring the modernist style of Finnegans Wake. The Báb himself categorised his writings into five modes: divine verses, prayers, commentaries, rational discourse – written in Arabic – and the Persian mode, which encompasses the previous four. Baháʼí scholars have argued that there are commonalities between the Báb&#x27;s writings and those of Western philosophers such as Hegel, Kant and James Joyce.

Most of the writings of the Báb have been lost. The Báb himself stated they exceeded five hundred thousand verses in length; the Qurʼan, in contrast, is 6300 verses in length. If one assumes 25 verses per page, that would equal 20,000 pages of text. Nabíl-i-Zarandí, in &quot;The Dawn-Breakers&quot;, mentions nine complete commentaries on the Qurʼan, revealed during the Báb&#x27;s imprisonment at Máh-Kú, which have been lost without a trace. Establishing the true text of the works that are still extant, as already noted, is not always easy, and some texts will require considerable work. Others, however, are in good shape; several of the Báb&#x27;s major works are available in the handwriting of his trusted secretaries.

Most works were revealed in response to specific questions by Bábís. This is not unusual; the genre of the letter has been a venerable medium for composing authoritative texts as far back as Paul of Tarsus. Three-quarters of the chapters of the New Testament are letters, were composed to imitate letters, or contain letters within them. Sometimes the Báb revealed works very rapidly by chanting them in the presence of a secretary and witnesses.

The Archives Department at the Baháʼí World Centre currently holds about 190 Tablets of the Báb. Excerpts from several principal works have been published in an English language compilation of the Báb&#x27;s writings: &quot;Selections from the Writings of the Báb&quot;, other publications include &quot;Prayers from the Bab: The Remembrance of God&quot;. Denis MacEoin, in his &quot;Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History&quot;, gives a description of many works; much of the following summary is derived from that source. In addition to major works, the Báb revealed numerous letters to his wife and followers, many prayers for various purposes, numerous commentaries on verses or chapters of the Qurʼan, and many khutbihs or sermons (most of which were never delivered). Many of these have been lost; others have survived in compilations.

Also significant to Bábism are the writings of Quddús, which &quot;display a close similarity to that of the Báb in both form and content&quot; according to Moojan Momen and Todd Lawson, as well as the poetry and prose of Tahirih.

==Outside reception==
Denis MacEoin, a scholar who was formerly a Baháʼí, describes Bábí law as a &quot;mishmash of rules and regulations that at times are little more than mere whimsy, revolving around some of the Bab&#x27;s own obsessions about cleanliness, polite behaviour, and elegance. It is a shari&#x27;a, but not in any practical sense. Certainly, it does not seem to be going anywhere...Here and there we find indications that the Bab had been impressed by Europeans and that he wanted his followers to emulate them.&quot; He further states: &quot;One comes away from the Bayan with a strong sense that very little of this is to be taken seriously. It is a form of a game, never actually intended to be put into practice, much in the same way that whole sections of the Bab&#x27;s later books don&#x27;t, in fact, mean anything very much, but are elaborate exercises in interesting things you can do with Arabic roots. Or the way so many of the Bab&#x27;s early writings, described as tafsirs on this or that sura of the Qurʼan, are really not commentaries at all.&quot; He further criticizes the Bábi laws, stating: &quot;The average Babi could hardly hope to afford the three diamonds, four yellow rubies, six emeralds, and six red rubies that he was expected to give to the Babi Messiah, let alone find time to observe all the rules and regulations laid down in the book. For all that, the Babi shari&#x27;a made an impact.&quot;

<text>Miller&#x27;s Crossing is a 1990 American neo-noir gangster film written, directed and produced by Joel and Ethan Coen, and starring Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro, Jon Polito, J. E. Freeman, and Albert Finney. The plot concerns a power struggle between two rival gangs and how the protagonist, Tom Reagan (Byrne), plays both sides against each other.

In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; chose &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical. &quot;Time&quot; critic Richard Corliss called it a &quot;noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest&quot;.

==Plot==

The year is 1929, Tom Reagan is the right-hand man for Irish mobster Leo O&#x27;Bannon, a political boss who runs an unnamed U.S. city during Prohibition. Leo sets off a mob war when he extends protection to his girlfriend Verna&#x27;s brother, a bookie named Bernie Bernbaum, who is skimming off the match fixing scheme of Leo&#x27;s rival, the Italian gangster Johnny Caspar. The situation is further complicated by the fact that behind Leo&#x27;s back, Verna is also sleeping with Tom.

Despite his own relationship with Verna, Tom presses Leo to give up her brother to Caspar. When the war heats up, with an assassination attempt on Leo, Tom tries to persuade Leo that he is foolish to protect Bernie on Verna&#x27;s behalf, making the point by revealing his affair with her. Leo publicly beats Tom and cuts ties with both him and Verna.

Cast out and needing work, Tom turns to Caspar. As a loyalty test, Caspar commands Tom to kill Bernie, an awkward request given Tom&#x27;s relationship with Bernie&#x27;s sister. With Caspar&#x27;s henchmen in tow, Tom leads Bernie to his execution in the woods at a spot called Miller&#x27;s Crossing. Bernie grovels for his life and desperately begs Tom not to kill him. Tom fakes the killing by firing his gun into the ground and orders Bernie to leave town. Caspar&#x27;s henchmen, who are within earshot but cannot see the two men, are fooled and neglect to check for the body before leaving with Tom.

With Leo weakened, Caspar takes his place as city boss, controlling the police and using them to destroy Leo&#x27;s operations.

Within Caspar&#x27;s gang, there is tension between Tom and Caspar&#x27;s trusted enforcer, the brutal Eddie Dane (&quot;the Dane&quot;). Upon learning that his men did not actually see Tom kill Bernie, the Dane takes Tom back to Miller&#x27;s Crossing to verify that Bernie&#x27;s body is there. Tom expects to find no corpse and to be executed for it, but instead the group finds a decomposing body that had been shot in the face and disfigured beyond recognition by birds. The Dane and his men assume the body is that of Bernie, but it is actually that of the Dane&#x27;s lover Mink, whom Bernie had secretly killed and placed as a decoy where his own body should have been. Tom is now vulnerable if the Dane or Caspar discovers the identity of the body, a fact that Bernie uses in an attempt to blackmail Tom into killing Caspar.

With Bernie supposedly dead, someone continues to cut into Caspar&#x27;s match fix, and Tom and the Dane each try to convince Caspar that the other is behind it. Tom uses Mink&#x27;s sudden disappearance to sow suspicion about the Dane by insinuating that Mink has gone into hiding after he and the Dane betrayed Caspar. Caspar must decide between Tom and the Dane, a dilemma he resolves by shooting the Dane in the head as Tom looks on.

Tom then thins out his rivals by engineering a surprise meeting between Bernie and Caspar, knowing that the first one to be seen by the other is likely to be killed. Shortly after the arranged time, Tom arrives to discover that Bernie has killed Caspar. Tom tricks Bernie into surrendering his gun and declares his intent to kill him in retribution for his blackmail. Bernie again begs for mercy, but Tom rejects his plea and shoots him dead.

With Caspar and the Dane dead, Leo resumes his post as the only boss in town. At Bernie&#x27;s burial, Verna, now back in Leo&#x27;s good graces, reacts coldly to Tom and walks back to her car. Leo notifies Tom that Verna has proposed to marry him. He offers Tom his job back but Tom turns him down and stays behind, watching Leo as he walks away.

==Cast==
==Production==
While writing the screenplay, the Coen brothers tentatively titled the film &quot;The Bighead&quot;—their nickname for Tom Reagan. The first image they conceived was that of a black hat coming to rest in a forest clearing; then, a gust of wind lifts it into the air, sending it flying down an avenue of trees. This image closes the film&#x27;s opening credit sequence.

Because of the intricate, dense plot, the Coens suffered from writer&#x27;s block with the script. They stayed with a close friend of theirs at the time, William Preston Robertson in Saint Paul, Minnesota, hoping that a change of scenery might help. After watching &quot;Baby Boom&quot; one night, they returned to New York City and wrote &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (in three weeks) before resuming the &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; screenplay.

The budget was reported by film industry magazines as around $14 million, but the Coens have said that the film cost &quot;substantially less&quot; than that. According to Paul Coughlin, &quot;The casting of Byrne allows for the psychological assurance, self-confidence and icy demeanour to be physically reproduced in the sturdy and unruffled presence of the tall and lean actor. Tom is &#x27;a man who walks behind a man, whispers in his ear&#x27;, he is the brains behind Leo&#x27;s operation, and he is the heartless centre of &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;.&quot; Although he was a native Irishman playing a lieutenant to an Irish mobster, the Coens did not originally want Gabriel Byrne to use his own accent in the film. Byrne argued that his dialogue was structured in such a way that it was a good fit for his accent and after he tried it, the Coens agreed.

During casting they had envisioned Trey Wilson (who played Nathan Arizona in their previous film &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;) as gangster boss Leo O&#x27;Bannon but two days before principal photography began, Wilson died from a brain hemorrhage and Finney was cast. Roger Westcombe calls Finney&#x27;s portrayal of Leo &quot;perfectly nuanced in a brilliant performance&quot;. Finney also appears in drag in a cameo as an elderly female ladies&#x27; room attendant.

The Coens cast family and friends in minor roles. Sam Raimi, director and friend of the Coens, appears as the snickering gunman at the siege of the Sons of Erin social club, while Frances McDormand, Joel Coen&#x27;s wife, appears as the mayor&#x27;s secretary. The role of The Swede was written for Peter Stormare but he could not be cast since he was playing Hamlet (a role often referred to as &quot;the Dane&quot;). J. E. Freeman was cast and the name of the character was changed to The Dane, while Stormare went on to be featured in &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.

The city in which the story takes place is unidentified but the film was shot in New Orleans as the Coen Brothers were attracted to its look. Ethan Coen commented in an interview, &quot;There are whole neighborhoods here of nothing but 1929 architecture. New Orleans is sort of a depressed city; it hasn&#x27;t been gentrified. There&#x27;s a lot of architecture that hasn&#x27;t been touched, store-front windows that haven&#x27;t been replaced in the last sixty years.&quot; Principal photography ran from January 27 to April 28, 1989.

==Influences==
Christopher Orr sees the opening scene, in which Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) confronts Leo O&#x27;Bannon (Albert Finney) and Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) as &quot;an obvious nod to the opening of &quot;The Godfather&quot;&quot;.

Roger Westcombe finds the title sequence of a fedora being blown off its bed of fallen leaves in the forest to be a subtle homage to Jean-Pierre Melville&#x27;s crime film &quot;Le Doulos&quot; (1962), which ends with the gangster protagonist&#x27;s fate underlined wistfully by the shot of his fedora coming to rest, alone in the frame, in the soil of the forest floor.

&quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; quotes many gangster films and films noir. Many situations, characters and dialogue are derived from the work of Dashiell Hammett, particularly his 1931 novel &quot;The Glass Key&quot;. There are some parallels between the two stories and many scenes and lines are lifted from this novel. The relationship between Tom and Leo in the film mirrors the relationship between Ned Beaumont and Paul Madvig, the principal characters of the Hammett novel. Another important Hammett source was his 1929 novel &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, which details the story of a gang war in a corrupt Prohibition-era American city, a war initiated by the machinations of the main character. While &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; follows the plot and main characters of &quot;The Glass Key&quot; fairly closely, the film has no direct scenes, characters, or dialogue from &quot;Red Harvest&quot; except for using a fixed boxing fight as a plot device.

Orr also notes, &quot;The ending of &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; makes even clearer reference to the immaculate final scene of &quot;The Third Man&quot;: a funeral, a protagonist abandoned by his car, who watches as the last person he cares for in the world walks away down a dirt road hemmed by trees&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
Although there is no mention of this on the packaging, the Criterion Blu-ray edition released in 2022 is over two minutes shorter than the theatrical release version. Among the cuts are Frankie&#x27;s line &quot;Jesus, Tom&quot; after Tom hits him in the face with a chair, and the line &quot;Take care now&quot; said by Lazzare&#x27;s messenger after Tom is subjected to a beating.

&quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; opened in limited release in New York City on September 22, 1990, after premiering at the New York Film Festival the day before. It was a box-office failure at the time, making slightly more than $5 million, out of its $10–$14 million budget.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though possibly more notable for its distinctive style than an airtight story, this Coen brothers&#x27; take on the classic gangster flick features sharp dialogue, impressive cinematography, and a typically quirky cast of characters.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of “C-“ on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic David Thomson calls the film &quot;a superb, languid fantasia on the theme of the gangster film that repays endless viewing&quot;. Of Turturro&#x27;s performance he says &quot;This could be the finest work of one of our best supporting actors&quot;. Roger Ebert gave it 3/4 stars, stating &quot;It is likely to be most appreciated by movie lovers who will enjoy its resonance with films of the past&quot;.

&quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; won the Critic&#x27;s Award at the 2nd Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in February 1991. It was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.

&quot;The Sopranos&quot; pays homage to &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, particularly in the &quot;Pine Barrens&quot; episode.

Frank Moraes says, &quot;Gabriel Byrne does an excellent job in this film, ... this film lives and dies on his performance&quot;. Taking particular note of the work of cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld and production designer Dennis Gassner, Christopher Orr observed, &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing is an aesthetic pleasure of the highest order on nearly every level&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Total Film&quot; placed it in their top 100 list. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it the 24th best crime movie of all time.

==Soundtrack==
The score was written by Carter Burwell, his third collaboration with the Coen brothers. The main theme is based on the Irish folk ballad &quot;Lament for Limerick&quot;. Burwell takes a traditional piece of music with some culturally relevant connection and uses it as the central motif of the broader arrangement. The main theme has been utilized in trailers for a number of other films, including &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, as well as in an ad for Caffrey&#x27;s Irish Ale.

The soundtrack includes jazz tunes, such as &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot;, reflective of the era in which the film is set. Other songs include &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, sung by Frank Patterson, an Irish tenor, which is heard in Leo&#x27;s house. Patterson can also be heard singing Jimmy Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; in a scene in the Shenandoah Club.

<text>Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (&quot;née&quot; Stevenson; 29 September 1810 – 12 November 1865), often referred to as Mrs Gaskell, was an English novelist, biographer, and short story writer. Her novels offer a detailed portrait of the lives of many strata of Victorian society, including the very poor. Her first novel, &quot;Mary Barton&quot;, was published in 1848. Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Charlotte Brontë&quot;, published in 1857, was the first biography of Charlotte Brontë. In this biography, she wrote only of the moral, sophisticated things in Brontë&#x27;s life; the rest she omitted, deciding certain, more salacious aspects were better kept hidden. Among Gaskell&#x27;s best known novels are &quot;Cranford&quot; (1851–1853), &quot;North and South&quot; (1854–1855), and &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; (1864–1866), all of which were adapted for television by the BBC.

==Early life==
Mrs. Gaskell was born Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson on 29 September 1810 in Lindsey Row, Chelsea, London, now 93 Cheyne Walk. The doctor who delivered her was Anthony Todd Thomson, whose sister Catherine later became Gaskell&#x27;s stepmother. She was the youngest of eight children; only she and her brother John survived infancy. Her father, William Stevenson, a Unitarian from Berwick-upon-Tweed, was minister at Failsworth, Lancashire, but resigned his orders on conscientious grounds. He moved to London in 1806 on the understanding that he would be appointed private secretary to James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale, who was to become Governor General of India. That position did not materialise, however, and Stevenson was nominated Keeper of the Treasury Records.

His wife, Elizabeth Holland, came from a family established in Lancashire and Cheshire that was connected with other prominent Unitarian families, including the Wedgwoods, the Martineaus, the Turners and the Darwins. When she died 13 months after giving birth to Gaskell, her husband sent the baby to live with Elizabeth&#x27;s sister, Hannah Lumb, in Knutsford, Cheshire. 

Her father remarried to Catherine Thomson, in 1814. They had a son, William, in 1815, and a daughter, Catherine, in 1816. Although Mrs. Gaskell spent several years without seeing her father, to whom she was devoted, her older brother John often visited her in Knutsford. John was destined for the Royal Navy from an early age, like his grandfathers and uncles, but he did not obtain preferment into the Service and had to join the Merchant Navy with the East India Company&#x27;s fleet. John went missing in 1827 during an expedition to India.

==Character and influences==
Much of Mrs. Gaskell&#x27;s childhood was spent in Cheshire, where she lived with her aunt Hannah Lumb in Knutsford, the town she immortalized as &quot;Cranford&quot;. They lived in a large red-brick house called The Heath (now Heathwaite). Mrs. Gaskell grew to be a beautiful young woman, well-groomed, tidily dressed, kind, gentle, and considerate of others. Her temperament was calm and collected, joyous and innocent, she revelled in the simplicity of rural life. 

From 1821 to 1826 she attended a school in Warwickshire run by the Misses Byerley, first at Barford and from 1824 at Avonbank outside Stratford-on-Avon, where she received the traditional education in arts, the classics, decorum and propriety given to young ladies from relatively wealthy families at the time. Her aunts gave her the classics to read, and she was encouraged by her father in her studies and writing. Her brother John sent her modern books, and descriptions of his life at sea and his experiences abroad.

After leaving school at the age of 16, Mrs. Gaskell travelled to London to spend time with her Holland cousins. She also spent some time in Newcastle upon Tyne (with the Rev William Turner&#x27;s family) and from there made the journey to Edinburgh. Her stepmother&#x27;s brother was the miniature artist William John Thomson, who in 1832 painted her portrait (see top right). A bust was sculpted by David Dunbar at the same time.

==Married life and writing career==

On 30 August 1832 Mrs. Gaskell married Unitarian minister William Gaskell, in Knutsford. They spent their honeymoon in North Wales, staying with her uncle, Samuel Holland, at Plas-yn-Penrhyn near Porthmadog. The Gaskells then settled in Manchester, where William was the minister at Cross Street Unitarian Chapel and longest-serving Chair of the Portico Library. Manchester&#x27;s industrial surroundings and books borrowed from the library influenced Elizabeth&#x27;s writing in the industrial genre. Their first daughter was stillborn in 1833. Their other children were Marianne (1834), Margaret Emily, known as Meta (1837), Florence Elizabeth (1842), and Julia Bradford (1846). Marianne and Meta boarded at the private school conducted by Rachel Martineau, sister of Harriet, a close friend of Elizabeth. Florence married Charles Crompton, a barrister and Liberal politician, in 1863.

In March 1835 Mrs. Gaskell began a diary documenting the development of her daughter Marianne: she explored parenthood, the values she placed on her role as a mother; her faith, and, later, relations between Marianne and her sister, Meta. In 1836 she co-authored with her husband a cycle of poems, &quot;Sketches among the Poor&quot;, which was published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in January 1837. In 1840 William Howitt published &quot;Visits to Remarkable Places&quot; containing a contribution entitled &quot;Clopton Hall&quot; by &quot;A Lady&quot;, the first work written and published solely by her. In April 1840 Howitt published &quot;The Rural Life of England&quot;, which included a second work titled &quot;Notes on Cheshire Customs&quot;.

In July 1841, the Gaskells travelled to Belgium and Germany. German literature came to have a strong influence on her short stories, the first of which she published in 1847 as &quot;Libbie Marsh&#x27;s Three Eras&quot;, in &quot;Howitt&#x27;s Journal&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;Cotton Mather Mills&quot;. But other influences including Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Social Politics&quot; enabled a much wider understanding of the cultural milieu in which her works were set. Her second story printed under the pseudonym was &quot;The Sexton&#x27;s Hero&quot;. And she made her last use of it in 1848, with the publication of her story &quot;Christmas Storms and Sunshine&quot;.

For some 20 years beginning in 1843, the Gaskells took holidays at Silverdale on Morecambe Bay, and in particular stayed at Lindeth Tower. Daughters Meta and Julia later built a house, &quot;The Shieling&quot;, in Silverdale.

A son, William, (1844–45), died in infancy, and this tragedy was the catalyst for Mrs. Gaskell&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Mary Barton&quot;. It was ready for publication in October 1848, shortly before they made the move south. It was an enormous success, selling thousands of copies. Ritchie called it a &quot;great and remarkable sensation.&quot; It was praised by Thomas Carlyle and Maria Edgeworth. She brought the teeming slums of manufacturing in Manchester alive to readers as yet unacquainted with crowded narrow alleyways. Her obvious depth of feeling was evident, while her turn of phrase and description was described as the greatest since Jane Austen.

In 1850, the Gaskells moved to a villa at 84 Plymouth Grove. She took her cow with her. For exercise, she would happily walk three miles to help another person in distress. In Manchester, Elizabeth wrote her remaining literary works, while her husband held welfare committees and tutored the poor in his study. The Gaskells&#x27; social circle included writers, journalists, religious dissenters, and social reformers such as William and Mary Howitt and Harriet Martineau. Poets, patrons of literature and writers such as Lord Houghton, Charles Dickens and John Ruskin visited Plymouth Grove, as did the American writers Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles Eliot Norton, while the conductor Charles Hallé, who lived close by, taught piano to one of their daughters. Elizabeth&#x27;s friend Charlotte Brontë stayed there three times, and on one occasion hid behind the drawing room curtains as she was too shy to meet the Gaskells&#x27; other visitors.
In early 1850 Gaskell wrote to Charles Dickens asking for advice about assisting a girl named Pasley whom she had visited in prison. Pasley provided her with a model for the title character of &quot;Ruth&quot; in 1853. &quot;Lizzie Leigh&quot; was published in March and April 1850, in the first numbers of Dickens&#x27;s journal &quot;Household Words&quot;, in which many of her works were to be published, including &quot;Cranford&quot; and &quot;North and South&quot;, her novella &quot;My Lady Ludlow&quot;, and short stories.

In June 1855, Patrick Brontë asked Gaskell to write a biography of his daughter Charlotte, and &quot;The Life of Charlotte Brontë&quot; was published in 1857. This played a significant role in developing Gaskell&#x27;s own literary career. In the biography, Gaskell chose to focus more on Brontë as a woman than as a writer of Romantic fiction. In 1859 Gaskell travelled to Whitby to gather material for &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Lovers&quot;, which was published in 1863. Her novella &quot;Cousin Phyllis&quot; was serialized in &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot; from November 1863 to February 1864. The serialization of her last novel, &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot;, began in August 1864 in &quot;The Cornhill&quot;. She died of a heart attack in 1865, while visiting a house she had purchased in Holybourne, Hampshire. &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; was published in book form in early 1866, first in the United States and then, ten days later, in Britain.

Her grave is near the Brook Street Chapel, Knutsford.

==Reputation and re-evaluation==
Mrs. Gaskell&#x27;s reputation from her death to the 1950s was epitomised by Lord David Cecil&#x27;s assessment in &quot;Early Victorian Novelists&quot; (1934) that she was &quot;all woman&quot; and &quot;makes a creditable effort to overcome her natural deficiencies but all in vain&quot; (quoted in Stoneman, 1987, from Cecil, p. 235). A scathing unsigned review of &quot;North and South&quot; in &quot;The Leader&quot; accused Gaskell of making errors about Lancashire which a resident of Manchester would not make and said that a woman (or clergymen and women) could not &quot;understand industrial problems&quot;, would &quot;know too little about the cotton industry&quot; and had no &quot;right to add to the confusion by writing about it&quot;.

Mrs. Gaskell&#x27;s novels, with the exception of &quot;Cranford&quot;, gradually slipped into obscurity during the late 19th century; before 1950, she was dismissed as a minor author with good judgment and &quot;feminine&quot; sensibilities. Archie Stanton Whitfield said her work was &quot;like a nosegay of violets, honeysuckle, lavender, mignonette and sweet briar&quot; in 1929. Cecil (1934) said that she lacked the &quot;masculinity&quot; necessary to properly deal with social problems (Chapman, 1999, pp. 39–40).

However, the critical tide began to turn in Mrs. Gaskell&#x27;s favour when, in the 1950s and 1960s, socialist critics like Kathleen Tillotson, Arnold Kettle and Raymond Williams re-evaluated the description of social and industrial problems in her novels (see Moore, 1999 for an elaboration), and—realising that her vision went against the prevailing views of the time—saw it as preparing the way for vocal feminist movements.
In the early 21st century, with Mrs. Gaskell&#x27;s work &quot;enlisted in contemporary negotiations of nationhood as well as gender and class identities&quot;, &quot;North and South&quot; – one of the first industrial novels describing the conflict between employers and workers – was recognized as depicting complex social conflicts and offering more satisfactory solutions through Margaret Hale: spokesperson for the author and Gaskell&#x27;s most mature creation.

In her introduction to &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Elizabeth Gaskell&quot; (2007), a collection of essays representing the current Gaskell scholarship, Jill L. Matus stresses the author&#x27;s growing stature in Victorian literary studies and how her innovative, versatile storytelling addressed the rapid changes during her lifetime.

==Literary style and themes==

Gaskell&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Mary Barton&quot;, was published anonymously in 1848. The best-known of her remaining novels are &quot;Cranford&quot; (1851–1853), &quot;North and South&quot; (1854–1855), and &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; (1864–1866). She became popular for her writing, especially her ghost stories, aided by Charles Dickens, who published her work in his magazine &quot;Household Words&quot;. Her ghost stories are in the &quot;Gothic&quot; vein, making them quite distinct from her &quot;industrial&quot; fiction.

Even though her writing conforms to Victorian conventions, including the use of the name &quot;Mrs. Gaskell&quot;, she usually framed her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes. Her early works were highly influenced by the social analysis of Thomas Carlyle and focused on factory work in the Midlands. She usually emphasized the role of women, with complex narratives and realistic female characters. Gaskell was influenced by the writings of Jane Austen, especially in &quot;North and South,&quot; which borrows liberally from the courtship plot of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. She was an established novelist when Patrick Brontë invited her to write a biography of his daughter, though she worried, as a writer of fiction, that it would be &quot;a difficult thing&quot; to &quot;be accurate and keep to the facts.&quot; Her treatment of class continues to interest social historians as well as fiction readers.

===Themes===
Unitarianism urges comprehension and tolerance toward all religions and even though Gaskell tried to keep her own beliefs hidden, she felt strongly about these values which permeated her works; in &quot;North and South&quot;, &quot;Margaret the Churchwoman, her father the Dissenter, Higgins the Infidel, knelt down together. It did them no harm.&quot;

===Dialect usage===
Gaskell&#x27;s style is notable for putting local dialect words into the mouths of middle-class characters and the narrator. In &quot;North and South&quot; Margaret Hale suggests &quot; up&quot; (tidying) the Bouchers&#x27; house and even offers jokingly to teach her mother words such as &quot;&quot; (strike-breaker). In 1854 she defended her use of dialect to express otherwise inexpressible concepts in a letter to Walter Savage Landor:

She also used the dialect word &quot;nesh&quot; (a person who feels the cold easily or often feels cold is said to be &#x27;nesh&#x27;), which goes back to Old English, in &quot;Mary Barton&quot;:

also in &quot;North and South&quot;:

and later in &quot;The Manchester Marriage&quot; (1858):

==Legacy==
The house on Plymouth Grove remained in the Gaskell family until 1913, after which it stood empty and fell into disrepair. The University of Manchester acquired it in 1969 and in 2004 it was acquired by the Manchester Historic Buildings Trust, which then raised money to restore it. Exterior renovations were completed in 2011; it is now open to the public as a historic house museum. In 2010, a memorial to Gaskell was unveiled in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey. The panel was dedicated by her great-great-great-granddaughter Sarah Prince and a wreath was laid. Manchester City Council have created an award in Gaskell&#x27;s name, given to recognize women&#x27;s involvement in charitable work and improvement of lives. A bibliomemoir &quot;Mrs. Gaskell and me: Two Women, Two Love Stories, Two centuries Apart&quot;, by Nell Stevens was published in 2018.

The playwright Margaret Macnamara wrote a play based on the novel which was performed in 1949. Her novel &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; aired on BBC television in 1999. In 2004, a television film miniseries aired on BBC television of her 1854 novel &quot;North and South&quot;. In 2007, her three part novella &quot;Cranford&quot; starring Judi Dench aired on BBC television.

The Gaskell Memorial Hall, Silverdale&#x27;s village hall, is so named because while funds were being raised for the building of the hall in 1928 a donor offered £50, or £100 if it was named thus: the conversation is recorded by novelist Willie Riley in his autobiography.

The rebuilt Cross Street Chapel in Manchester houses a collection of memorabilia of the writer in the Gaskell Room of the new building.

<text>Indigenous peoples in Brazil or Native Brazilians () are the peoples who lived in Brazil before European contact around 1500 and their descendants. Indigenous peoples once comprised an estimated 2,000 district tribes and nations inhabiting what is now Brazil. The 2010 Brazil census recorded 305 ethnic groups of Indigenous people who spoke 274 Indigenous languages; however, almost 77% speak Portuguese.

Historically, many Indigenous peoples of Brazil were semi-nomadic and combined hunting, fishing, and gathering with migratory agriculture. Many tribes faced extinction as a result of European settlement, and many others were assimilated into the general Brazilian population.

The Indigenous population was decimated by European diseases, declining from a pre-Columbian high of 2 million to 3 million to approximately 300,000 by 1997, distributed among 200 tribes. According to the 2022 IBGE census, 1,693,535 Brazilians classified themselves as Indigenous, and the census recorded 274 Indigenous languages spoken by 304 different Indigenous ethnic groups.

On 18 January 2007, Fundação Nacional do Índio reported 67 remaining uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 known in 2005. With this increase, Brazil surpassed New Guinea, becoming the country with the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world.

==History==

===Origins===

Questions about the original settlement of the Americas have led to various hypothetical models. The origins of these Indigenous peoples remain a matter of debate among archaeologists.

====Migration into the continents====
Anthropological and genetic evidence suggests that most Amerindian people descended from migrants from Siberia and Mongolia who entered the Americas across the Bering Strait and along the western coast of North America in at least three separate waves. In Brazil, most native tribes living in the land by 1500 are thought to be descended from the first wave of Siberian migrants, who are believed to have crossed the Bering Land Bridge at the end of the last Ice Age, between 13,000 and 17,000 years ago. This initial migration would have taken some time to reach present-day Brazil, likely entering the Amazon River basin from the Northwest. The second and third migratory waves from Siberia, which are thought to have led to the Athabaskan, Aleut, Inuit, and Yupik people, apparently did not reach farther than the southern United States and Canada, respectively.

====Genetic studies====

===== Y-chromosome DNA =====
An analysis of Amerindian Y-chromosome DNA reveals specific clustering within much of the South American population. The micro-satellite diversity and distributions of Y-chromosome lineages specific to South America suggest that certain Amerindian populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region.

===== Autosomal DNA =====
According to a 2012 autosomal DNA genetic study, Native Americans descend from at least three main migrant waves from Siberia. Most of their ancestry traces back to a single ancestral population, referred to as the &#x27;First Americans&#x27;. However, Inuit-speaking populations from the Arctic inherited nearly half of their ancestry from a second Siberian migrant wave, while Na-dene speakers inherited about one-tenth of their ancestry from a third migrant wave. The initial settlement of the Americas was followed by a rapid expansion southward along the coast, with limited gene flow later, especially in South America. An exception to this is the Chibcha speakers, whose ancestry includes contributions from both North and South America.

===== mtDNA =====

Another study, focused on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is inherited only through the maternal line, revealed that the maternal ancestry of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas traces back to a few founding lineages from Siberia, likely arriving via the Bering Strait. According to this study, the ancestors of Native Americans likely remained near the Bering Strait for a time before rapidly spreading throughout the Americas and eventually reaching South America. A 2016 study on mtDNA lineages found that &quot;a small population entered the Americas via a coastal route around 16,000 years ago, following a period of isolation in eastern Beringia for approximately 2,400 to 9,000 years after separating from eastern Siberian populations. After spreading rapidly throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in a distinct phylogeographic structure of populations, which persisted over time. All ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression test to Bayesian serial coalescent simulations. The analysis supported a scenario in which European colonization caused a substantial loss of pre-Columbian lineages.&quot;

===== Linguistic comparison with Siberia =====

Linguistic studies have supported genetic findings, revealing ancient patterns between the languages spoken in Siberia and those in the Americas.

===== The Oceanic component in the Amazon region =====

Two 2015 autosomal DNA genetic studies confirmed the Siberian origins of the Native peoples of the Americas. However, an ancient signal of shared ancestry with the Indigenous peoples of Australia and Melanesia was detected among the Native populations of the Amazon region. This migration from Siberia is estimated to have occurred around 23,000 years ago.

====Archaeological remains====

Brazilian native peoples, unlike those in Mesoamerica and the Andean civilizations, did not keep written records or erect stone monuments. The humid climate and acidic soil have destroyed almost all traces of their material culture, including wood and bones. Therefore, what is known about the region&#x27;s history before 1500 has been inferred and reconstructed from limited archaeological evidence, such as ceramics and stone arrowheads.

The most conspicuous remains of these societies are vast mounds of discarded shellfish, known as &quot;sambaquis&quot;, found at some coastal sites that were continuously inhabited for more than 5,000 years. Additionally, substantial &quot;black earth&quot; (&quot;terra preta&quot;) deposits in several places along the Amazon are believed to be ancient garbage dumps (middens). Recent excavations of these deposits in the middle and upper Amazon have uncovered remains of massive settlements, containing tens of thousands of homes, indicating a complex social and economic structure.

Studies of the wear patterns of precontact inhabitants of coastal Brazil found that the surfaces of anterior teeth facing the tongue were more worn than those facing the lips. Researchers believe this wear was caused by using teeth to peel and shred abrasive plants.

====Marajoara culture====
The Marajoara culture flourished on Marajó island at the mouth of the Amazon River. Archaeologists have uncovered sophisticated pottery in their excavations on the island. These pieces are large, elaborately painted, and incised with representations of plants and animals. This discovery provided the first evidence of a complex society on Marajó. Further evidence of mound building suggests that well-populated, complex, and sophisticated settlements developed on the island, as only such settlements were believed capable of undertaking extensive projects like major earthworks.

The extent, level of complexity, and resource interactions of the Marajoara culture have been subjects of dispute. In the 1950s, American archaeologist Betty Meggers, in some of her earliest research, suggested that the society migrated from the Andes and settled on the island. Many researchers believed that the Andes were populated by Paleoindian migrants from North America, who gradually moved south after being hunters on the plains.

In the 1980s, American archaeologist Anna Curtenius Roosevelt led excavations and geophysical surveys of the mound Teso dos Bichos. She concluded that the society that constructed the mounds originated on the island itself.

The pre-Columbian culture of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population as large as 100,000 people. The Native Americans of the Amazon rainforest may have used their method of developing and working in terra preta to make the land suitable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support large populations and complex social formations, such as chiefdoms.

====Xinguano civilisation====
The Xingu peoples built large settlements connected by roads and bridges, often featuring moats. Their development peaked between 1200 CE and 1600 CE, with their population reaching into the tens of thousands.

===Native people after the European colonisation===

==== Distribution ====

On the eve of the Portuguese arrival in 1500, the coastal areas of Brazil were dominated by two major groups: the &quot;Tupi&quot; (speakers of Tupi–Guarani languages), who occupied almost the entire length of the Brazilian coast, and the &quot;Tapuia&quot; (a general term for non-Tupi groups, usually Jê-speaking peoples), who primarily resided in the interior. The Portuguese arrived at the end of a long pre-colonial conflict between the Tupis and Tapuias, which had led to the defeat and expulsion of the Tapuias from most coastal areas.

Although the coastal Tupi were divided into sub-tribes that were frequently hostile to each other, they were culturally and linguistically homogeneous. The fact that early Europeans encountered essentially the same people and language along the Brazilian coast greatly facilitated communication and interaction.

Coastal Sequence c. 1500 (north to south):
# Tupinambá (Tupi, from the Amazon delta to Maranhão)
# Tremembé (Tapuia, coastal tribe, ranged from São Luis Island (south Maranhão) to the mouth of the Acaraú River in north Ceará; French traders cultivated an alliance with them)
# Potiguara (Tupi, literally &quot;shrimp-eaters&quot;; they had a reputation as great canoeists and aggressive expansionists, inhabited a great coastal stretch from Acaraú River to Itamaracá island, covering the modern states of southern Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte and Paraíba.)
# Tabajara (tiny Tupi tribe between Itamaracá island and Paraíba River; neighbors and frequent victims of the Potiguara)
# Caeté (Tupi group in Pernambuco and Alagoas, ranged from Paraíba River to the São Francisco River; after killing and eating a Portuguese bishop, they were subjected to Portuguese extermination raids and the remnant pushed into the Pará interior)
# Tupinambá again (Tupi par excellence, ranged from the São Francisco River to the Bay of All Saints, population estimated as high as 100,000; hosted Portuguese castaway Caramuru)
# Tupiniquim (Tupi, covered the Bahian discovery coast, from around Camamu to São Mateus River; these were the first Indigenous people encountered by the Portuguese, having met the landing of captain Pedro Álvares Cabral in April 1500)
# Aimoré (Tapuia (Jê) tribe; concentrated on a sliver of coast in modern Espírito Santo state)
# Goitacá (Tapuia tribe; once dominated the coast from the São Mateus River (in Espírito Santo state) down to the Paraíba do Sul River (in Rio de Janeiro state); hunter-gatherers and fishermen, they were a shy people that avoided all contact with foreigners; estimated at 12,000; they had a fearsome reputation and were eventually annihilated by European colonists)
# Temiminó (small Tupi tribe, centered on Governador Island in Guanabara Bay; frequently at war with the Tamoio around them)
# Tamoio (Tupi, an old branch of the Tupinambá, ranged from the western edge of Guanabara Bay to Ilha Grande)
# Tupinambá again (Tupi, indistinct from the Tamoio. Inhabited the Paulist coast, from Ilha Grande to Santos; main enemies of the Tupiniquim to their west. Numbered between six and ten thousand).
# Tupiniquim again (Tupi, on the São Paulo coast from Santos/Bertioga down to Cananéia; aggressive expansionists, they were recent arrivals imposing themselves on the Paulist coast and the Piratininga plateau at the expense of older Tupinambá and Carijó neighbors; hosted Portuguese castaways João Ramalho (&#x27;Tamarutaca&#x27;) and António Rodrigues in the early 1500s; the Tupiniquim were the first formal allies of the Portuguese colonists, helped establish the Portuguese Captaincy of São Vicente in the 1530s; sometimes called &quot;Guaianá&quot; in old Portuguese chronicles, a Tupi term meaning &quot;friendly&quot; or &quot;allied&quot;)
# Carijó (Guarani (Tupi) tribe, ranged from Cananeia all the way down to Lagoa dos Patos (in Rio Grande do Sul state); victims of the Tupiniquim and early European slavers; they hosted the mysterious &quot;degredado&quot; known as the &#x27;Bachelor of Cananeia&#x27;)
# Charrúa (Tapuia (Jê) tribe in modern Uruguay coast, with an aggressive reputation against intruders; killed Juan Díaz de Solís in 1516)
With the exception of the hunter-gatherer Goitacases, the coastal Tupi and Tapuia tribes were primarily agriculturalists. The subtropical Guarani cultivated maize, tropical Tupi cultivated manioc (cassava), and highland Jês cultivated peanuts as the staple of their diet. Supplementary crops included beans, sweet potatoes, cará (yam), &quot;jerimum&quot; (pumpkin), and &quot;cumari&quot; (capsicum pepper).

Behind the coasts, the interior of Brazil was primarily dominated by Tapuia (Jê) people, although significant sections of the interior (notably the upper reaches of the Xingu, Teles Pires, and Juruena Rivers, roughly corresponding to modern Mato Grosso state) were the original pre-migration Tupi-Guarani homelands. In addition to the Tupi and Tapuia, two other Indigenous mega-groups were commonly identified in the interior: the Caribs, who inhabited much of what is now northwestern Brazil, including both shores of the Amazon River up to the delta, and the Nuaraque group, whose constituent tribes inhabited several areas, including most of the upper Amazon (west of present-day Manaus) and significant pockets in modern Amapá and Roraima states.

The names by which different Tupi tribes were recorded by Portuguese and French authors in the 16th century are poorly understood. Most do not seem to be proper names but rather descriptions of relationships, usually familial—e.g., &quot;Tupi&quot; means &quot;first father,&quot; &quot;Tupinambá&quot; means &quot;relatives of the ancestors,&quot; &quot;Tupiniquim&quot; means &quot;side-neighbors,&quot; &quot;Tamoio&quot; means &quot;grandfather,&quot; &quot;Temiminó&quot; means &quot;grandson,&quot; &quot;Tabajara&quot; means &quot;in-laws,&quot; and so on. Some etymologists believe these names reflect the ordering of migration waves of Tupi people from the interior to the coasts. For example, the first Tupi wave to reach the coast might have been referred to as &quot;grandfathers&quot; (Tamoio), soon joined by the &quot;relatives of the ancients&quot; (Tupinambá), which could mean relatives of the Tamoio or a Tamoio term for relatives of the old Tupi in the upper Amazon basin. The &quot;grandsons&quot; (Temiminó) might represent a splinter group, while the &quot;side-neighbors&quot; (Tupiniquim) could denote recent arrivals still establishing their presence. However, by 1870, the Tupi tribes&#x27; population had declined to 250,000 Indigenous people, and by 1890, it had diminished to approximately 100,000.

====First contacts====

When the Portuguese explorers first arrived in Brazil in April 1500, they found, to their astonishment, a wide coastline rich in resources and teeming with hundreds of thousands of Indigenous people living in a &quot;paradise&quot; of natural abundance. Pero Vaz de Caminha, the official scribe of Pedro Álvares Cabral, the commander of the discovery fleet that landed in the present state of Bahia, wrote a letter to the King of Portugal describing in glowing terms the beauty of the land.

In &quot;Histoire des découvertes et conquêtes des Portugais dans le Nouveau Monde,&quot; Lafitau described the natives as people who wore no clothing but painted their entire bodies red. Their ears, noses, lips, and cheeks were pierced. The men would shave the front, top of the head, and over the ears, while women typically wore their hair loose or in braids. Both men and women accessorized with noisy porcelain collars and bracelets, feathers, and dried fruits. Lafitau also described the ritualistic nature of their cannibalism practices and highlighted the important role of women in the household.

Before the arrival of Europeans, the territory of present-day Brazil had an estimated population of between 1 and 11.25 million inhabitants. During the first 100 years of contact, the Amerindian population was reduced by 90%. This drastic decline was primarily due to diseases and illnesses brought by the colonists, compounded by slavery and European violence. The Indigenous people were traditionally semi-nomadic tribes who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migratory agriculture. For centuries, they lived semi-nomadic lives, managing the forests to meet their needs.

When the Portuguese arrived in 1500, the natives primarily inhabited the coast and the banks of major rivers. Initially, Europeans viewed them as noble savages, and miscegenation began almost immediately. Portuguese claims of tribal warfare, cannibalism, and the pursuit of Amazonian brazilwood for its prized red dye convinced the colonists that they needed to &quot;civilize&quot; the natives (originally, the Portuguese named Brazil Terra de Santa Cruz, but it later acquired its current name (see List of meanings of countries&#x27; names) from the brazilwood). However, like the Spanish in North America, the Portuguese brought diseases to which many Amerindians had no immunity. Measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, and influenza caused the deaths of tens of thousands. The diseases spread rapidly along Indigenous trade routes, likely leading to the annihilation of entire tribes without direct contact with Europeans.

By 1800, the population of Colonial Brazil had reached approximately 2.33 million, of which only around 174,900 were Indigenous. By 1850, that number had dwindled to an estimated 78,400 out of a total population of 5.8 million.

====Slavery and the bandeiras====

The mutual feeling of wonderment and goodwill was to end in the subsequent years. The Portuguese colonists, all males, began to have children with female Amerindians, creating a new generation of mixed-race people who spoke Amerindian languages, including a Tupi language called Nheengatu. The children of these Portuguese men and Amerindian women soon formed the majority of the population. Groups of fierce explorers organized expeditions known as &quot;bandeiras&quot; (flags) into the interior to claim territory for the Portuguese crown and to search for gold and precious stones.

Intending to profit from the sugar trade, the Portuguese decided to cultivate sugar cane in Brazil and to use Indigenous slaves as the workforce, following the example of the Spanish colonies. However, capturing Indigenous people proved difficult. They were soon afflicted by diseases brought by the Europeans, against which they had no natural immunity, leading to high mortality rates.

====The Jesuits====


Jesuit priests arrived with the first Governor General as clerical assistants to the colonists, with the intention of converting the Indigenous people to Catholicism. They argued that the Indigenous people should be regarded as human and succeeded in obtaining a Papal bull, &quot;Sublimis Deus,&quot; which declared that, regardless of their beliefs, they should be recognized as fully rational human beings with rights to freedom and private property, and thus should not be enslaved.

Jesuit priests, such as Fathers José de Anchieta and Manuel da Nóbrega, studied and recorded the Indigenous languages and founded mixed settlements, such as São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, where colonists and Amerindians lived side by side, spoke the same &quot;Língua Geral&quot; (common language), and freely intermarried. They also began to establish more remote villages inhabited only by &quot;civilized&quot; Amerindians, known as Missions or reductions (see the article on the Guarani people for more details).

By the middle of the 16th century, Jesuit priests, at the behest of Portugal&#x27;s monarchy, had established missions throughout the country&#x27;s colonies. They aimed to Europeanize and convert the Indigenous populations to Catholicism. Some historians argue that the Jesuits provided a period of relative stability for the Amerindians and opposed using them for slave labor. However, the Jesuits also contributed to European imperialism. Many historians view Jesuit involvement as an ethnocide of Indigenous culture, where the Jesuits attempted to &#x27;Europeanize&#x27; the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil.

In the mid-1770s, the fragile coexistence between the Indigenous peoples and the colonists was once again threatened. Due to a complex diplomatic situation involving Portugal, Spain, and the Vatican, the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil, and their missions were confiscated and sold.

====Wars====
A number of wars broke out between various tribes, such as the Tamoio Confederation, and the Portuguese. Occasionally, the Amerindians allied with Portugal’s enemies, such as the French during the France Antarctique episode in Rio de Janeiro. At other times, they sided with Portugal against rival tribes. During this period, a German soldier named Hans Staden was captured by the Tupinambá and later released. He documented his experiences in his famous book &quot;Warhaftige Historia und Beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen&quot; (1557), which translates to &quot;True Story and Description of a Country of Wild, Naked, Grim, Man-Eating People in the New World, America&quot;.

There are documented accounts of smallpox being used as a biological weapon by some Brazilian villagers seeking to eliminate nearby Amerindian tribes, not always aggressively. One notable instance, according to anthropologist Mércio Pereira Gomes, occurred in Caxias, in southern Maranhão. Local farmers, desiring more land for their cattle farms, gave clothing from sick villagers (which would normally have been burned to prevent further infection) to the Timbira. The clothing infected the entire tribe, who had neither immunity nor a cure. Similar incidents occurred in other villages throughout South America.

====The rubber trade====
The 1840s brought trade and wealth to the Amazon with the development of the vulcanization process for rubber, leading to a worldwide surge in demand. The best rubber trees in the world grew in the Amazon, and thousands of rubber tappers began working the plantations. When the Amerindians proved to be a difficult labor force, peasants from surrounding areas were brought in. This created ongoing tension between the Indigenous population and the new arrivals, as the Amerindians felt their lands were being invaded in the pursuit of wealth.

====The legacy of Cândido Rondon====

In the 20th century, the Brazilian government adopted a more humanitarian approach and began offering official protection to the Indigenous people, including establishing the first Indigenous reserves. The situation for the Amerindians improved around the turn of the century when Cândido Rondon, a man of both Portuguese and Bororo ancestry, and an explorer and progressive officer in the Brazilian army, began working to gain the Amerindians&#x27; trust and establish peace. Rondon, assigned to extend telegraph communications into the Amazon, was a natural explorer with a keen curiosity. In 1910, he helped establish the &quot;Serviço de Proteção aos Índios (SPI),&quot; now known as FUNAI (&quot;Fundação Nacional do Índio&quot;, National Foundation for Indians). SPI was the first federal agency tasked with protecting Amerindians and preserving their culture. In 1914, Rondon accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on his famous expedition to map the Amazon and discover new species. During these travels, Rondon was appalled by the treatment of the Indigenous people by settlers and developers, and he became their lifelong friend and protector.

Rondon, who died in 1958, is considered a national hero in Brazil. The Brazilian state of Rondônia is named in his honor.

====SPI failure and FUNAI====

After Rondon&#x27;s pioneering work, the SPI was handed over to bureaucrats and military officers, and its effectiveness declined after 1957. The new officials did not share Rondon&#x27;s deep commitment to the Amerindians. Instead, the SPI sought to integrate tribal groups into mainstream Brazilian society. The promise of wealth from reservation lands attracted cattle ranchers and settlers, who continued encroaching on Indigenous territories, with the SPI facilitating this intrusion. Between 1900 and 1967, an estimated 98 Indigenous tribes were wiped out.

Due largely to the efforts of the Villas-Bôas brothers, Brazil&#x27;s first Indigenous reserve, the Xingu National Park, was established by the federal government in 1961.

During the social and political upheaval of the 1960s, reports of mistreatment of Amerindians increasingly reached Brazil&#x27;s urban centers and began to affect public opinion. In 1967, following the publication of the &quot;Figueiredo Report&quot;, commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior, the military government launched an investigation into the SPI. It was soon revealed that the SPI was corrupt and failing to protect natives, their lands, and their culture. The 5,000-page report cataloged atrocities including slavery, sexual abuse, torture, and mass murder. It was alleged that agency officials, in collaboration with land speculators, were systematically slaughtering the Amerindians by intentionally distributing disease-laced clothing. Criminal prosecutions followed, and the SPI was disbanded.

The same year, the government established the Fundação Nacional do Índio (National Indian Foundation), known as FUNAI, which is responsible for protecting the interests, cultures, and rights of Indigenous peoples in Brazil. Some tribes have become significantly integrated into Brazilian society. The unacculturated tribes that have been contacted by FUNAI are supposed to be protected and accommodated within Brazilian society to varying degrees. By 1987, it was recognized that unnecessary contact with these tribes was causing illness and social disintegration. Uncontacted tribes are now meant to be shielded from intrusion and interference in their lifestyle and territory. However, the exploitation of rubber and other Amazonian natural resources has led to a new cycle of invasion, expulsion, massacres, and death, which continues to this day.

====The military government====
In 1964, a seismic political shift occurred when the Brazilian military took control of the government and abolished all existing political parties, creating a two-party system. For the next two decades, Brazil was ruled by a series of generals. The country&#x27;s mantra was &quot;Brazil, the Country of the Future,&quot; which the military government used to justify a massive push into the Amazon to exploit its resources, aiming to transform Brazil into one of the leading economies of the world.

Construction began on a transcontinental highway across the Amazon basin, designed to encourage migration to the region and facilitate trade. Funded by the World Bank, thousands of square miles of forest were cleared without regard for reservation status. Following the highway projects, giant hydroelectric projects were initiated, and vast areas of forest were cleared for cattle ranching. As a result, reservation lands suffered massive deforestation and flooding. The public works projects attracted very few migrants, but those who did arrive—largely poor settlers—brought new diseases that further devastated the Amerindian population.

====Contemporary situation====

The 1988 Brazilian Constitution recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to pursue their traditional ways of life and to the permanent and exclusive possession of their &quot;traditional lands,&quot; which are demarcated as Indigenous Territories. Additionally, Indigenous peoples are legally recognized as one of several &quot;traditional peoples&quot;. In practice, however, Brazil&#x27;s Indigenous people still face significant threats and challenges to their continued existence and cultural heritage. 

The process of land demarcation is slow, often involving protracted legal battles, and FUNAI lacks sufficient resources to enforce legal protections on Indigenous lands. Since the 1980s, exploitation of the Amazon Rainforest for mining, logging, and cattle ranching had surged, which poses a severe threat to the region&#x27;s Indigenous population. Settlers illegally encroaching on Indigenous land continue to destroy the environment necessary for traditional ways of life, provoke violent confrontations, and spread disease. 

Groups such as the Akuntsu and Kanoê have been pushed to the brink of extinction in the past three decades. Deforestation for mining also affects the daily lives of Indigenous tribes in Brazil. For example, the Munduruku Amerindians have higher levels of mercury poisoning due to gold production in their area. On 13 November 2012, the national Indigenous people association from Brazil, APIB, submitted a human rights document to the United Nations, detailing complaints about proposed laws in Brazil that would further undermine their rights if approved.

Many terms from Native languages have been incorporated into official Brazilian Portuguese. For example, &quot;Carioca,&quot; the term used to describe people born in the city of Rio de Janeiro, derives from the Tupi-Guaraní word meaning &quot;house of the white (people).&quot;

Within hours of taking office in January 2019, Bolsonaro made two major changes to FUNAI, affecting its responsibility to identify and demarcate Indigenous territories. He moved FUNAI from under the Ministry of Justice to the newly created Ministry of Human Rights, Family, and Women, and he delegated the identification of traditional habitats of Indigenous people and their designation as protected territories—a task attributed to FUNAI by the constitution—to the Agriculture Ministry. Bolsonaro argued that these territories had tiny, isolated populations and proposed integrating them into larger Brazilian society. Critics feared that such integration would lead to cultural assimilation of the Brazilian natives. Several months later, Brazil&#x27;s National Congress overturned these changes.

The European Union–Mercosur free trade agreement, which aims to create one of the world&#x27;s largest free trade areas, has been denounced by environmental activists and Indigenous rights campaigners. They fear that the deal could lead to increased deforestation of the Amazon rainforest by expanding market access for Brazilian beef.

A 2019 report by the Indigenous Missionary Council on Violence Against Indigenous Peoples in Brazil documented an increase in invasions of Indigenous lands by loggers, miners, and land grabbers. The report recorded 160 cases in the first nine months of 2019, up from 96 cases for all of 2017. Additionally, the number of reported killings increased from 110 in 2017 to 135 in 2018.

On May 5, 2020, following an investigation by Human Rights Watch (HRW), Brazilian lawmakers released a report examining violence against Indigenous people, Afro-Brazilian rural communities, and others involved in illegal logging, mining, and land grabbing.

== Indigenous rights movements ==

=== Urban rights movement ===
The urban rights movement is a recent development in the advocacy for Indigenous peoples&#x27; rights. Brazil has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, and a significant portion of its population includes Indigenous tribes migrating towards urban areas, both by choice and due to displacement. Beyond the urban rights movement, studies have shown that the suicide risk among the Indigenous population is 8.1 times higher than that of the non-Indigenous population.

Many Indigenous rights movements have been created through the gathering of various Indigenous tribes in urban areas. For example, in Barcelos, an Indigenous rights movement emerged due to &quot;local migratory circulation.&quot; This is how many alliances form, creating a stronger network for mobilization. Indigenous populations living in urban areas also face struggles related to work, often being pressured into low-paying jobs. Programs like Oxfam have been used to help Indigenous people gain partnerships and start grassroots movements. Some of these projects overlap with environmental activism.

Many Brazilian youths are mobilizing due to increased social contact, as some Indigenous tribes remain isolated while others adapt to change. Access to education also affects these youths, prompting more groups to mobilize and fight for Indigenous rights.

=== Environmental and territorial rights movement ===
==== Dynamics favouring recognition ====
Many of the rights and claims of Indigenous tribes align with the environmental and territorial rights movement. Although Indigenous people have secured 21% of the Brazilian Amazon as Indigenous land, many issues still threaten the sustainability of these territories today. Climate change is one reason Indigenous tribes emphasize the importance of retaining their territory.

Some Indigenous peoples and conservation organizations in the Brazilian Amazon have formed alliances, such as the partnership between the A&#x27;ukre Kayapo village and the Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) environmental organization. They focus on environmental, educational, and developmental rights. For example, Amazon Watch collaborates with various Indigenous organizations in Brazil to fight for both territorial and environmental rights. Activists emphasize traditional conservation efforts and expanding territorial rights for Indigenous people, given that &quot;access to natural resources by Indigenous and peasant communities in Brazil has been considerably less and much more insecure.&quot; 

Territorial rights for the Indigenous populations of Brazil are largely intertwined with socio-economic issues. There have been violent conflicts over land rights between the government and the Indigenous population, with political rights doing little to stop them. Movements like the Landless Workers&#x27; Movement (MST) work to prevent land from being concentrated in the hands of the elite in Brazil.

==== Dynamics opposing recognition ====
Environmentalists and Indigenous peoples are often viewed as opponents to economic growth and barriers to development. This perception arises because much of the land inhabited by Indigenous tribes could potentially be used for development projects, including dams and industrialization.

Groups self-identifying as Indigenous may lack intersubjective recognition. As a result, their claims to Indigenous Territories (TIs), which often involve the demarcation of large areas of land and may dispossess established local communities, can be challenged by others. Even neighboring kinship groups might dispute these claims, arguing that those making them are not &quot;real Indians&quot; due to factors like historical intermarriage (miscegenation), cultural assimilation, and stigma against self-identifying as Indigenous. Additionally, claims to TIs can be opposed by major landowning families from the rubber era or by peasants working the land, who might instead prefer the concept of extractive reserve.

== Education ==

The Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous History and Culture Law (Law No. 11.645/2008) mandates the teaching of Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous History and Culture in Brazil. The law was enacted on 10 March 2008, amending Law No. 9.394 of 20 December 1996, as modified by Law No. 10.639 of 9 January 2003. It requires that the official curriculum of the Brazilian education system include the mandatory theme of Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous History and Culture.

<doc id="55519" wikidata="Q1582628" url="?curid=55519" title="NeWS">
<text>NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as &quot;SunDew&quot;, its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple &quot;contexts&quot; to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI.

== Design ==
NeWS started by implementing a PostScript interpreter running in a cooperative multitasking fashion, since, unlike PostScript in a printer, NeWS would be displaying a number of PostScript programs at the same time on one screen. It also added a complete view hierarchy, based on viewports known as &quot;canvases&quot;, and a synchronous event distribution system, supporting &quot;events&quot;, &quot;interests&quot;, &quot;threads&quot; and &quot;monitors&quot;.

Like the view system in most GUIs, NeWS included the concept of a tree of embedded views along which events were passed. For instance, a mouse click would generate an event that would be passed to the object directly under the mouse pointer, say a button. If this object did not respond to the event, the object &quot;under&quot; the button would then receive the message, and so on. NeWS included a complete model for these events, including timers and other automatic events, input queues for devices such as mice and keyboards, and other functionality required for full interaction. The input handling system was designed to provide strong event synchronization guarantees that were not possible with asynchronous protocols like X.

To support user interface widgets, NeWS expanded the original PostScript stack-based language into a complete object-oriented (OO) programming style with inheritance. This eliminated the need for an external OO language to build a complete application. Since all of these additions were implemented as extensions to PostScript, it was possible to write simple PostScript code that would result in a running, onscreen, interactive program. Two popular demonstration programs were an onscreen clock, which required about two pages of code, and a program which drew a pair of eyes that followed the cursor as it moved around the screen. The eyeball program was shown at SIGGRAPH in 1988 and was the inspiration for the later well-known X application xeyes.

NeWS included several libraries of user interface elements (widgets), themselves written in NeWS. These widgets ran all of their behavior in the NeWS interpreter, and only required communications to an outside program (or more NeWS code) when the widget demanded it. For example, a toggle button&#x27;s display routine can query the button&#x27;s state (pressed or not) and change its display accordingly. The button&#x27;s PostScript code can also react to mouse clicks by changing its state from &quot;pressed&quot; to &quot;not pressed&quot; and vice versa. All this can happen in the windowing server without interaction with the client program, and only when the mouse is released on the button will an event be sent off for handling. This was more sophisticated than the X Window System server model, which can only report &quot;mouse button was clicked down here&quot;, &quot;mouse is now here&quot;, &quot;mouse button was released here&quot; events to a client, which then has to figure out if the event is in the button, switch the state, and finally instruct the server to display the new state. If client and server are not on the same machine, these interactions must travel over the network, which results in a delay in responding.
The best example of such a library is TNT (&quot;The NeWS Toolkit&quot;) which Sun released in 1989. Sun also shipped an earlier &quot;Lite&quot; toolkit intended for example purposes and making small programs.

== Porting ==
Although adoption was never widespread, several companies and universities licensed NeWS and adapted it for various uses, creating both commercial and non-commercial ports.

* SGI used a version of it named 4Sight to replace their proprietary MEX windowing system.
* Grasshopper Group created a Macintosh port called MacNeWS.
* Parallax Graphics extended it to be able to deal with live video.
* Architech Corporation ported NeWS to OS/2, calling it NeWS/2
* Columbia University ported it on HP 9000 series 3000
* Los Alamos National Laboratory ported it on a Cray XMP-24
* TGV ported X11/NeWS on a VAXstation 2000 running VMS
* Wedge Computer Inc. ported it to MacOS
* Whitechapel ported it to their MIPS workstations
* Acorn ported it to their computers
* Ameristar ported it on the Amiga 2000
* Alliant ported X11/NeWS on their Visualization minisupercomputers
* University of Michigan ported it on Apollo workstations, in monochrome mode
* Pixar ported it to their Image Computer

== Applications ==

The OPEN LOOK version of the FrameMaker desktop publishing program, developed by Frame Technology Corp. with funding mainly from Sun Microsystems and NSA, was one of the few commercial products that ran on NeWS. HyperLook, developed by Arthur van Hoff at The Turing Institute, was an interactive application design system. Don Hopkins developed a NeWS version of &quot;SimCity&quot; that was built with HyperLook.

A commercial drawing program, Altsys Virtuoso, was produced for NeWS; it was a port of FreeHand with additional functionality that took advantage of the PostScript environment. Unfortunately Sun announced the end of support for NeWS just as Virtuoso became ready to ship.

== Competition with X Window System ==

Compared to X, NeWS was vastly more powerful, but also slower (especially for local connections). The C API was very low level and difficult to use, so most NeWS programs tended to be entirely written in PostScript. Another factor in the popularity was that Sun charged a fee to license the NeWS source code, while the MIT X11 code was free of cost.

The first versions of NeWS emulated the X10 protocol by translating the calls into NeWS PostScript. Speed problems plus the existence of programs that relied on the exact pixel results of X10 calls, and the obsolescence of X10, forced Sun to release an X11/NeWS hybrid called &quot;Xnews&quot; which ran an X11 server in parallel with the PostScript interpreter. This seriously degraded the NeWS interpreter performance and was not considered a very good X11 server either. Sun also implemented the OPEN LOOK user interface specification in several toolkits: The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an OPEN LOOK toolkit written in PostScript that ran in the NeWS server. OLIT was built on the same Xt (X Intrinsics) base as Motif, and XView used the same APIs as Sun&#x27;s earlier SunView window system.

After it was clear that OPEN LOOK had lost out to Motif in popularity, and after Adobe acquired FrameMaker, Sun stopped supporting NeWS. Products based on NeWS stopped being developed.

<text>Abdul Nasser () is a male Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words &#x27;,&#x27; and &quot;&quot;. The name means &quot;servant of the Helper&quot;, &quot;An-Nasser&quot; being a Muslim theophoric name.

The letter &quot;a&quot; of the &quot;al-&quot; is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by &quot;u&quot;. The short &quot;u&quot; is taken from the classical Arabic nominative case ending, whereby the first element of the name is &quot;&#x27;Abdu&quot;. Because the letter &quot;n&quot; is a sun letter, the letter &quot;l&quot; of the &quot;al-&quot; can be assimilated to it. Thus, although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to &quot;Abd al-Nasser&quot;, the pronunciation can correspond to &quot;Abd an-Nasser&quot;. Alternative transliterations of the last element include &quot;Naaser&quot;, &quot;Nasir&quot; and others, with the whole name subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.

<doc id="55523" wikidata="Q273055" url="?curid=55523" title="R. Kelly">
<text>Robert Sylvester Kelly (born January 8, 1967) is an American former singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is credited with prolific commercial success in R&amp;B, hip hop, and pop music recordings, earning nicknames such as &quot;the King of R&amp;B&quot;, &quot;the King of Pop-Soul&quot;, and &quot;the Pied Piper of R&amp;B&quot;. Kelly&#x27;s career ended in 2019 following his arrest and subsequent convictions on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges involving sexual abuse of minors.

Born on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, Kelly began performing in the subway under the Chicago &quot;L&quot; tracks, and regularly busked at the &quot;L&quot; stop on the Red Line&#x27;s Jackson station in the Loop. During his recording career, Kelly released 18 studio albums which yielded a number of hit singles, including &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot;, &quot;Bump N&#x27; Grind&quot;, &quot;Your Body&#x27;s Callin&#x27;, &quot;Fiesta (Remix)&quot;, &quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot;, &quot;Step in the Name of Love (Remix)&quot;, &quot;If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time&quot;, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Flirt (Remix)&quot;, and the hip hopera &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot;. In 1998, he won three Grammy Awards for &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot;. Alongside his recording career, Kelly&#x27;s songwriting and production work was credited on albums by Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Justin Bieber, Janet Jackson, Chris Brown, Aaliyah, Usher, Ciara, Toni Braxton, Luther Vandross, and Mary J. Blige. Kelly received a Grammy Award nomination for his contributions to Jackson&#x27;s 1995 single, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, which earned a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; as the first song to debut atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the chart&#x27;s history. Kelly&#x27;s 1998 collaboration with Dion, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Angel&quot;, did so once more.

Kelly sold over 75 million albums and singles worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time, and the most successful R&amp;B male artist of the 1990s. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has recognized Kelly as one of the best-selling artists in the United States with 40 million albums sold. In 2011, Kelly was named the most successful R&amp;B artist of the last 25 years by &quot;Billboard&quot;. Kelly won Grammy Awards, BET Awards, Soul Train Music Awards, &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, NAACP Image Awards, and American Music Awards.

Kelly had long been the subject of accusations of sexual abuse, including that of minors, dating back to the 1990s. Following leaked video recordings, Kelly was prosecuted on child pornography charges in 2002, leading to a controversial trial that ended with his acquittal in 2008 on all charges. The 2019 documentary &quot;Surviving R. Kelly&quot; re-examined Kelly&#x27;s alleged sexual misconduct with minors, prompting RCA Records to terminate his contract. Renewed interest in the allegations resulted in additional investigations by law enforcement beginning in 2019, which led to multiple indictments and Kelly&#x27;s arrest. In 2021 and 2022, he was convicted on multiple charges involving child sexual abuse. As of 2025, he is serving a 31-year combined sentence at FCI Butner Medium I in North Carolina.

==Early life==
Robert Sylvester Kelly was born on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, on January 8, 1967, at Chicago Lying-In Hospital (now University of Chicago Medical Center) in the city&#x27;s Hyde Park neighborhood. He has five siblings (three of whom are half): two older sisters and brother, along with a younger brother and sister. His mother, Joanne, was a schoolteacher and devout Baptist. She was born in Arkansas. The identity of his father, who was absent from Kelly&#x27;s life and later raised two children, is not known. His family lived in the Ida B. Wells Homes public housing project in the Black Metropolis–Bronzeville District of Chicago&#x27;s Douglas neighborhood, also on the city&#x27;s south side. Around the time he was five years old, Kelly&#x27;s mother married his stepfather, Lucious, who reportedly worked for an airline. Kelly began singing in the church choir at age eight.

=== Trauma and abuse ===
Kelly described having a girlfriend, Lulu, at age eight, in his 2012 autobiography &quot;Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me&quot;. He stated that their last play date turned tragic when, after fighting with older children over a play area by a creek, she was pushed into the water, swept downstream by a fast-moving current, and drowned. Kelly called Lulu his first musical inspiration.

Kelly said members of his household would act differently when his mother and grandparents were not home. This included highly provocative dress and behavior. Kelly stated that when he was eight, an adult woman in the household coerced him into photographing her while having intercourse with an adult male partner.

From age 8 to 14, he was often sexually abused by an older female family member. Kelly&#x27;s younger brother, Carey, stated that he suffered from years of sexual abuse at the hands of their older sister, Theresa, who was entrusted with babysitting the siblings. Carey stated that although their older brother, Bruce, was spared and allowed to play outside, both he and Kelly were punished at separate times indoors by Theresa, who refused to acknowledge the abuse when confronted years later.

Explaining why he never told anyone, Kelly wrote in his autobiography that he was &quot;too afraid and too ashamed&quot;. Around age 10, Kelly was also sexually abused by an older male who was a friend of the family. In his autobiography, Kelly describes being shot in the shoulder at age 13 by boys who were attempting to steal his bike, although a family friend claims his mother disputed this, stating that the gunshot was self-inflicted during a suicide attempt.

=== Turn toward music ===

In September 1980, Kelly entered Kenwood Academy in the city&#x27;s Hyde Park-Kenwood district, where he met music teacher Lena McLin, who encouraged Kelly to perform Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Ribbon in the Sky&quot; in the high school talent show. A shy Kelly put on sunglasses, was escorted onto the stage, performed the song, and was awarded first prize. McLin encouraged Kelly to leave the high school basketball team and concentrate on music. She said he was furious at first, but after his performance in the talent show, he changed his mind. Kelly was diagnosed with dyslexia, which left him unable to read or write. Kelly dropped out of high school after attending Kenwood Academy for one year. He began performing in the subway under the Chicago &quot;L&quot; tracks. He regularly busked at the &quot;L&quot; stop on the Red Line&#x27;s Jackson station in the Loop.

In his youth, Kelly played basketball with Illinois state champion basketball player Ben Wilson and later sang &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday&quot; at Wilson&#x27;s funeral.

==Career==
During his recording career, Kelly sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him the most commercially successful male R&amp;B artist of the 1990s and one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. He won three Grammys for his song &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot;, and was also nominated for his song &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; recorded by Michael Jackson. Critics dubbed him &quot;the King of R&amp;B&quot; while he billed himself the &quot;Pied Piper of R&amp;B&quot;.

===1989–1994: &quot;Born into the 90&#x27;s and&quot; &quot;12 Play&quot;===

MGM (Musically Gifted Men or Mentally Gifted Men) was formed in 1989 with Robert Kelly, Marc McWilliams, Vincent Walker and Shawn Brooks. In 1990, MGM were offered a contract with an independent label, Tavdash Records. Shortly after, they recorded and released one single, &quot;Why You Wanna Play Me&quot;. Kelly gained national recognition when MGM participated on the talent TV show &quot;Big Break&quot;, hosted by Natalie Cole. MGM performed &quot;All My Love&quot;, which would become a demo for Kelly&#x27;s song &quot;She&#x27;s Got That Vibe&quot;. The group went on to win the $100,000 grand prize in 1991 before they disbanded.

In 1991, Kelly signed with Jive Records. Kelly&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Born into the 90&#x27;s&quot;, was released in early 1992 (credited as R. Kelly and Public Announcement). The album, released during the new jack swing period of the early 1990s, yielded the R&amp;B hits &quot;She&#x27;s Got That Vibe&quot;, &quot;Honey Love&quot;, &quot;Dedicated&quot;, and &quot;Slow Dance (Hey Mr. DJ)&quot;, with Kelly singing lead vocals. During late 1992, Kelly and Public Announcement embarked on a tour entitled &quot;60653&quot; after the zip code of their Chicago neighborhood. This would be the only album co-credited with Public Announcement. Kelly separated from the group in 1993.

Kelly&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;12 Play&quot;, was released on November 9, 1993, and yielded the singer&#x27;s first number-one hit, &quot;Bump N&#x27; Grind&quot;, which spent a record-breaking 12 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B Singles chart. Subsequent hit singles: &quot;Your Body&#x27;s Callin&#x27;&quot; (U.S. Hot 100: #13, U.S. R&amp;B: #2) and &quot;Sex Me&quot; (U.S. Hot 100: #20, U.S. R&amp;B: #8). Both singles sold 500,000 copies in the United States and were certified Gold by the RIAA. In 1994, &quot;12 Play&quot; was certified Gold by the RIAA, eventually going six times platinum.

In 1994, Kelly established himself as a leading producer by producing songs for various artists, including Aaliyah, Janet Jackson, and Changing Faces. He co-headlined a tour with Salt-N-Pepa and headlined the Budweiser Superfest tour.

=== 1995–1996 &quot;R. Kelly&quot; and &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot; ===

In 1995, Kelly garnered his first Grammy nominations; two for writing, producing, and composing Michael Jackson&#x27;s last number-one hit, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;.

Kelly&#x27;s success continued with the November 14, 1995, release of &quot;R. Kelly&quot;, his eponymous second studio album. Critics praised him for his departure from salacious bedroom songs to embracing vulnerability. &quot;New York Times&quot; contributor Stephen Holden described Kelly as &quot;The reigning king of pop-soul sex talks a lot tougher than Barry White, the father of such fluffed-up pillow talks and along with Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway, [both] major influences for Kelly.&quot; In December 1995, Professor Michael Eric Dyson critiqued Kelly&#x27;s self-titled album &quot;R. Kelly&quot; for &quot;VIBE&quot;. Dyson described Kelly&#x27;s growth from the &quot;12 Play&quot; album: &quot;Kelly reshapes his personal turmoil to artistic benefit&quot; and noted that Kelly is &quot;reborn before our very own ears&quot;.

The album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, becoming Kelly&#x27;s first number one album on the chart, and reached number one on the R&amp;B album charts; his second. The &quot;R. Kelly&quot; album spawned three platinum hit singles: &quot;You Remind Me of Something&quot; (U.S. Hot 100: #4, U.S. R&amp;B: #1), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Sleep Baby (If I)&quot; (U.S. Hot 100: #5, U.S. R&amp;B: #1), and &quot;Down Low (Nobody Has To Know)&quot; (U.S. Hot 100: #4, U.S. R&amp;B: #1); a duet with Ronald Isley. Kelly&#x27;s self-titled album sold four million copies, receiving 4× platinum certification from the RIAA. He promoted the album with a 50-city &quot;Down Low Top Secret Tour&quot; with LL Cool J, Xscape, and Solo.

On November 26, 1996, Kelly released &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot;, an inspirational song originally released on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Space Jam&quot;. &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot; reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and No. 1 on the UK charts for three weeks and won three Grammy Awards in 1998. In that same year, he contributed to &quot;Freak Tonight&quot; for the &quot;A Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; soundtrack.

===1997–2001: Basketball, &quot;R.&quot;, &quot;TP-2.com&quot;, and Rockland Records===

In 1997, Kelly signed a contract to play professional basketball with the Atlantic City Seagulls of the USBL. He wore the number 12 in honor of his album &quot;12 Play&quot;. Kelly said &quot;I love basketball enough to not totally let go of my music, but just put it to the side for a minute and fulfill some dreams of mine that I&#x27;ve had for a long time.&quot; Kelly&#x27;s USBL contract contained a clause that would allow him to fulfill a music obligation when necessary. &quot;If Whitney Houston needs a song written&quot;, said Ken Gross, the Seagulls owner who signed Kelly, &quot;he would be able to leave the team to do that and come back&quot;. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a gimmick&quot;, Gross continued, &quot;he&#x27;s a ballplayer. He can play.&quot;

In the same year, Kelly collaborated with American rapper The Notorious B.I.G. for the song &quot;Fuck You Tonight&quot; on the posthumous album &quot;Life After Death&quot;.

In 1998, he launched his own label, Rockland Records, in a distribution deal with Jimmy Iovine&#x27;s Interscope Records. The label&#x27;s roster included artists Sparkle, Boo &amp; Gotti, Talent, Vegas Cats, Lady, Frankie, Secret Weapon, and Rebecca F. That May, Sparkle, Rockland&#x27;s first signed artist, released her eponymous debut album. In addition to producing and writing the project, Kelly made vocal contribution to the hit duet &quot;Be Careful&quot;, which became a serious factor as to why the album was certified platinum in December 2000.

On November 17, 1998, Kelly released his fourth studio and first double album, &quot;R.&quot; Musically, the album spans different genres from pop (Celine Dion), street rap (Nas and Jay-Z) to Blues (&quot;Suicide&quot;). Dave Hoekstra of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the album as &quot;easily the most ambitious project of his career&quot;. In the summer of 1999, he wrote and produced a majority of the soundtrack to the Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy film, &quot;Life&quot;, which features tracks from K-Ci &amp; JoJo, Maxwell, Mýa, and Destiny&#x27;s Child, among others. The soundtrack was also released on the Rockland imprint.

In early 2000, Kelly received multiple awards reflecting his status as an established R&amp;B superstar. In January 2000, he won Favorite Male Soul/R&amp;B Artist at the American Music Awards and, in February, was nominated for several Grammy Awards, including Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance (&quot;When a Woman&#x27;s Fed Up&quot;), Best R&amp;B Album (&quot;R.&quot;), and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (&quot;Satisfy You&quot;) with P. Diddy.

On November 7, 2000, he released his fifth studio album, &quot;TP-2.com&quot;, a project aligned with his breakthrough album, &quot;12 Play&quot;. Unlike &quot;R.&quot;, all songs on &quot;TP-2.com&quot; were written, arranged, and produced by Kelly. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier gave &quot;TP-2.com&quot; 4 stars and stated: &quot;Kelly knows how to take proven formulas and funnel them through his own stylistic aesthetic, which usually means slowing down the tempo, laying on lush choruses of strings and background vocals, taming down the lyrics for radio, and catering his pitch primarily to wistful women.

In 2001, Kelly won the Outstanding Achievement Award at the Music of Black Origin or MOBO Awards and &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked &quot;TP-2.com&quot; number 94 on the magazine&#x27;s Top 200 Albums of the Decade. Kelly&#x27;s song, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest&quot;, from the soundtrack to the 2001 autobiographical film, &quot;Ali&quot;, was a hit.

===2002–2003: &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Factory&quot;===

On January 24, 2002, at a press conference announcing the completion of Kelly and Jay-Z&#x27;s first collaborative album, &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;, celebrities such as Johnnie Cochran, Russell Simmons, Luther Vandross, and Sean Combs praised the album, with Jay-Z stating that he hoped the collaboration represents &quot;more unity for black people on a whole&quot;. MTV&#x27;s Shaheem Reid wrote: &quot;And if Jay and Kelly can put their egos to the side long enough to wrap up and promote their album, then their labels—Def Jam and Jive, respectively—can surely figure out a way to join forces and make cheddar together.&quot;

On February 8, 2002, Kelly performed at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics, a week after a news scandal broke of a sex tape that appeared to show Kelly with an underage girl.

Following a leak of the joint album on February 22, 2002, Roc-A-Fella and Jive moved the release date one week earlier in an effort to curtail piracy. Jay-Z expressed frustration about the album leak to MTV News, describing the event as both a &quot;gift&quot; and a &quot;curse.&quot; Upon release on March 19, 2002, &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; sold 285,000 copies in its opening week and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was a critical and commercial disappointment.

In May 2002, six months prior to the scheduled release of Kelly&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Loveland&quot;, a bootleg copy containing 15 tracks had been leaked. In response, Kelly began work on the album now known as &quot;Chocolate Factory&quot;, opting to release Loveland as a deluxe edition bonus disc. In October of that year, Kelly released &quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot;, the lead single from his upcoming album. It would spend 42 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number two.

On February 18, 2003, Kelly released &quot;Chocolate Factory,&quot; which debuted as the number one album on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. It sold 532,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with critical acclaim, and supported by two more singles. &quot;Snake&quot;, the albums second single, was followed by &quot;Step in the Name of Love (Remix)&quot;, which charted for 70 weeks, reaching number one on the R&amp;B/Hip-hop airplay charts. Later that year, in September, Kelly&#x27;s first greatest hits album, &quot;The R. in R&amp;B Collection, Vol. 1&quot;, was released which included &quot;Thoia Thoing&quot; and two other previously unreleased songs.

===2004–2005: &quot;Unfinished Business, Happy People/U Saved Me&quot; and &quot;TP.3 Reloaded&quot;===

Between mid-2003 and early 2004, Kelly began work on a double CD album, one with &quot;happy&quot; tracks and another with &quot;inspirational&quot; tracks. The double album, &quot;Happy People/U Saved Me&quot;, was released on August 24, 2004. It debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first week sales of 264,000 copies. Both of the album&#x27;s titled tracks respectively performed underwhelmingly; &quot;Happy People&quot; charted at number twenty-nine on the Adult R&amp;B song chart while &quot;U Saved Me&quot; peaked at number fifty-two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Two months later, Kelly and Jay-Z reunited to release their second collaborative album, &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;. The album received criticism and, as with the pair&#x27;s previous collaboration, it was also a commercial failure, despite debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Album promotion and its &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; tour were both plagued by tension between the stars, with Kelly reportedly showing up late or not at all to gigs. Kelly complained that the touring lights were not directed towards him and allegedly assaulted the tour&#x27;s lighting director.

Jay-Z eventually removed Kelly halfway through the tour, after a member of Jay-Z&#x27;s entourage pepper sprayed Kelly on October 29, 2004. Tyran &quot;Ty Ty&quot; Smith was charged with assault, but took a plea deal for disorderly conduct. Kelly bounced back commercially after appearing on Ja Rule&#x27;s single, &quot;Wonderful&quot; alongside Ashanti. In November 2004, &quot;Wonderful&quot; charted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the UK Singles Chart. The single was certified gold by the RIAA in May 2005.

After finishing &quot;Happy People/U Saved Me&quot; and &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; in 2004, Kelly released &quot;TP.3 Reloaded&quot; in July 2005. It became Kelly&#x27;s fifth consecutive number-one album in his career. &quot;TP.3 Reloaded&quot; was heavily cross-promoted alongside the first five chapters of Kelly&#x27;s musical serial, the &quot;hip hopera&quot; &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot;.

=== 2006–2009: &quot;Double Up&quot; and &quot;Untitled&quot;, Africa ===

In December 2006, Kelly built momentum for his eighth solo studio album, &quot;Double Up&quot;, after guest-appearing on Bow Wow&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Flirt&quot;. Three months later, Kelly&#x27;s remix of &quot;I&#x27;m a Flirt&quot; was released, but instead of Bow Wow, it featured T.I. and T-Pain. On May 29, 2007, the album was released. It became Kelly&#x27;s sixth and final album in his career to chart at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Kelly&#x27;s other singles from &quot;Double Up&quot; titled &quot;Same Girl&quot; was a duet of Kelly and Usher, while &quot;Rise Up&quot; was a tribute to the victims of the Virginia Tech shooting that occurred earlier that year in April, a month before the album was released. The song was previously released as a digital download on May 15, 2007. Proceeds were donated to the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund to help family members of the victims of the shootings.

Kelly began his &quot;Double Up&quot; tour with Ne-Yo, Keyshia Cole and J. Holiday opening for him. One week into the tour, promoter Leonard Rowe had Ne-Yo removed from the tour because of a contract dispute. However, Ne-Yo alleges that the reason for the dropout was because Ne-Yo believes he received a better response from critics and fans. Ne-Yo won a lawsuit that he filed against Rowe Entertainment in 2008. Kelly was not mentioned in the lawsuit. In December 2007, Kelly failed to appear at another preliminary court hearing on his case due to his tour bus being held up in Utah. The judge threatened to revoke Kelly&#x27;s bond, but eventually decided against it. In 2008, Kelly released a rap track titled &quot;I&#x27;m a Beast&quot; in which he coarsely attacked his detractors, yet did not name the subjects of the song.

In 2008, before and after being acquitted on charges of producing child sexual abuse material, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Kelly had plans to release his newest album titled &quot;12 Play: Fourth Quarter&quot; in the summer of that year but the album was postponed. &quot;Billboard&quot; named Kelly among the most successful artists ever for its 50th Anniversary List. In the spring, the promotional single &quot;Hair Braider&quot;, peaked at No. 56 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B chart. On July 28, the entire album leaked online, causing the title to be scrapped.

In February 2009, Kelly announced that he was working on a new album called &quot;Untitled&quot; with a projected release date of September 29, but it had been delayed to December. In June 2009, he released his first mixtape, &quot;The &quot;Demo&quot; Tape,&quot; presented by DJ Skee and DJ Drama.

Kelly headlined the Arise African Fashion Awards in Johannesburg, South Africa, on June 20, 2009. He performed in Cape Town, followed by Nigeria as part of the annual ThisDay music and fashion festival in July. That same month, he released &quot;Number One&quot;, featuring singer-songwriter Keri Hilson. Then, on December 1, Kelly&#x27;s untitled ninth solo album was released. It charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number four. More singles from the album include &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Supaman High&quot; and &quot;Be My #2&quot;. In January 2010, Kelly performed in Kampala, Uganda. &quot;I&#x27;m very excited about my first visit to Africa, I&#x27;ve dreamed about this for a long time and it&#x27;s finally here&quot;, Kelly said in a statement. &quot;It will be one of the highlights of not only my career but my life. I can&#x27;t wait to perform in front of my fans in Africa—who have been some of the best in the world.&quot;

===2010–2012: &quot;Epic&quot;, &quot;Love Letter&quot;, throat surgery, and &quot;Write Me Back&quot;===

Kelly performed at the 2010 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony on June 11, 2010. In an interview in the September 2010 issue of &quot;XXL&quot; magazine, Kelly said he was working on three new albums (&quot;Epic&quot;, &quot;Love Letter&quot;, and &quot;Zodiac&quot;) which he described as &quot;remixing himself&quot;. &quot;Epic&quot;, a compilation filled with powerful ballads including &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest&quot; and &quot;Sign of a Victory&quot;, only saw a European release on September 21, 2010. However, it is also available for streaming worldwide.

In November 2010, Kelly collaborated with several African musicians forming a supergroup known as One8. The group featured 2Face from Nigeria, Ali Kiba from Tanzania, Congolese singer Fally Ipupa, 4X4 from Ghana, hip-hop artist Movaizhaleine from Gabon, Zambia&#x27;s JK, Ugandan hip-hop star Navio and Kenya&#x27;s Amani, the only female in the group. The first release from the group was &quot;Hands Across the World&quot; written and produced by Kelly.

Kelly&#x27;s tenth album &quot;Love Letter&quot;, released on December 14, 2010, included 15 songs, one of which was Kelly singing &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, a track Kelly originally wrote for Michael Jackson. The first single &quot;When a Woman Loves&quot; was nominated for a Grammy for Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.

At the 2011 Pre-Grammy Gala in Los Angeles, Kelly performed a medley of hits, and, in March 2011, Kelly was named the No. 1 R&amp;B artist of the last 25 years by &quot;Billboard&quot;.

On July 19, 2011, Kelly was admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago to undergo emergency throat surgery to drain an abscess on one of his tonsils, and was released on July 21, 2011. He canceled his performance at the Reggae Sumfest in Jamaica that was scheduled for the following Friday. Johnny Gourzong, Sumfest Productions executive director, commented, &quot;We are truly going to miss his presence on the festival.&quot; On September 23, 2011, &quot;Variety&quot; confirmed that Kelly had signed on to write original music for the &quot;Sparkle&quot; soundtrack.

In 2011, Kelly worked with writer David Ritz on an autobiography entitled &quot;Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me&quot;, which was later released in the summer of 2012.
On October 7, 2011, after Sony&#x27;s RCA Music Group announced the consolidation of Jive, Arista and J Records into RCA Records, Kelly was set to release music under the RCA brand.

Following his throat surgery, Kelly released &quot;Shut Up&quot; to generally favorable reviews: &quot;Spin&quot; magazine said, &quot;Kelly taking aim at the haters who said &quot;he&#x27;s washed up, he&#x27;s lost it.&quot; He hasn&#x27;t. Dude&#x27;s voice is in prime smooth R&amp;B form&quot;. On December 21, 2011, Kelly made a live appearance on &quot;The X Factor&quot; and gave his first performance after the surgery. Kelly revealed to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he felt like he was &quot;just starting out&quot; and how the performance was a &quot;wake up call&quot; for him.

In 2012, Kelly made a series of announcements including a follow-up to the &quot;Love Letter&quot; album titled &quot;Write Me Back&quot;, which was released on June 26 to little fanfare, as well as a third installment of &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot; and The Single Ladies Tour featuring R&amp;B singer, Tamia. In February 2012, Kelly performed &quot;I Look to You&quot;, a song he wrote for Whitney Houston, at Houston&#x27;s homegoing.

===2013–2017: &quot;Black Panties&quot;, &quot;The Buffet&quot;, and &quot;12 Nights of Christmas&quot;===

During 2013, Kelly continued his &quot;The Single Ladies Tour&quot;. He performed at music festivals across North America, including Bonnaroo, Pitchfork, and Macy&#x27;s Music Festival. On June 30, 2013, R. Kelly performed live at BET Awards Show singing hits as well as his new track &quot;My Story&quot; featuring Atlanta rapper 2 Chainz. The song was the lead single for Kelly&#x27;s twelfth studio album &quot;Black Panties&quot;. released on December 10, 2013. Writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, David Marchese stated that Black Panties &quot;was like a dare to the world: After all that he&#x27;d been accused of, after avoiding conviction, could R. Kelly still get away with making sex-obsessed music?&quot;

In 2013, Kelly collaborated with several artists including Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, and Jennifer Hudson. In an interview with &quot;Global Grind&quot; in November, he described follow up work with Celine Dion after their number one single &quot;I&#x27;m Your Angel&quot; from 1998. Kelly worked with singer Mariah Carey for her album &quot;The Art of Letting Go&quot;.

Kelly co-wrote and sang on Lady Gaga&#x27;s song &quot;Do What U Want&quot; from her 2013 album &quot;Artpop&quot;, performing the duet with her on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on November 16, 2013, and at the 2013 American Music Awards. &quot;Do What U Want&quot; had since been removed from streaming services and re-releases of Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Artpop&quot; album following sexual misconduct allegations against Kelly in early 2019. He also collaborated with Birdman and Lil Wayne on &quot;We Been On&quot;, a single from the Cash Money Records compilation, &quot;Rich Gang&quot;. He also appeared on Twista&#x27;s first single on his new album &quot;Dark Horse&quot;. On November 17, 2013, Kelly and Justin Bieber debuted a collaboration entitled &quot;PYD&quot;.

Kelly was featured on the soundtrack album of the film &quot;The Best Man Holiday&quot; with his song &quot;Christmas, I&#x27;ll Be Steppin&#x27;&quot;. Kelly stated his intention to tour with R&amp;B singer Mary J. Blige on &quot;The King &amp; Queen Tour&quot; prior to the Black Panties Tour while continuing to create segments of the hip hopera &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot;. In July 2014, Kelly announced that he was working on a house music album.

In November 2015, Kelly released &quot;Switch Up&quot; featuring fellow Chicagoan Jeremih and Lil Wayne, followed by &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot;, &quot;Marching Band&quot; and &quot;Backyard Party&quot;. The following month, the album containing those singles, &quot;The Buffet&quot;, was released. It charted poorly on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number sixteen with first-week sales of 39,000 album-equivalent copies. During November 2015, R. Kelly released a song with Ty Dolla Sign called &quot;Actress&quot; off the album &quot;Free TC&quot;. The following year, after a two-and-a-half-year delay, Kelly presented his only Christmas album, also his fourteenth and final studio album in his career thus far, &quot;12 Nights of Christmas&quot;, which was released on October 21, 2016.

=== 2017–2022: Guest appearances, &quot;I Admit&quot; ===
On March 17, Pitbull released the song &quot;Dedicated&quot; off his album &quot;Climate Change&quot; and features guest appearances from American singers R. Kelly and Austin Mahone.

Kelly released the 19-minute-long &quot;I Admit&quot; on SoundCloud on July 23, 2018, as a response to his accusers. The song does not contain any criminal admissions despite its title and chorus, which repeats the lyric &quot;I admit it, I did it&quot;. In &quot;I Admit&quot;, Kelly denies allegations of domestic violence and pedophilia, asserting that they are matters of opinion. Kelly also denounces Jim DeRogatis and repudiates his investigative report&#x27;s claim of Kelly operating a &quot;sex cult&quot;. Addressing the Mute R. Kelly social media campaign, Kelly sings, &quot;only God can mute me&quot;.

The song was criticized by reviewers, who described it as an act of trolling. Many outlets compared the song to that of his &quot;Heaven I Need a Hug&quot; extended version, &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot; opera, &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot; concert remix, and O. J. Simpson&#x27;s autobiographical novel &quot;If I Did It&quot;. Andrea Kelly and Carey Killa Kelly (R. Kelly&#x27;s ex-wife and brother, respectively) responded to &quot;I Admit&quot; with songs that contain additional allegations against R. Kelly.

An album credited to Kelly titled &quot;I Admit It&quot; after and including the 19-minute song from 2018 was released on streaming services on December 9, 2022, but was taken down after it was not approved by Sony or R. Kelly&#x27;s team. The album was credited to Sony&#x27;s Legacy Recordings but actually uploaded by Real Talk Entertainment, who had released the album through a sub-label also named Legacy Recordings. This resulted in the credited distributor, Universal Music Group–owned Ingrooves, cutting ties with Real Talk Entertainment.

== Artistry ==

=== Musical style and influences ===
Kelly&#x27;s music took root in R&amp;B, hip hop and soul. He was influenced by listening to his mother, Joanne Kelly, sing. She played records by Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway and Marvin Gaye, inspirations for Kelly. In reference to Hathaway, Kelly stated: &quot;A guy like Donny Hathaway had a focused, sexual texture in his voice that I always wanted in mine. He had smooth, soulful tones, but he was spiritual at the same time. In his autobiography, Kelly stated that he was heavily influenced by Marvin Gaye&#x27;s R&amp;B Lothario image. &quot;I had to make a &#x27;baby-makin″&#x27; album. If Marvin Gaye did it, I wanted to do it&quot;, Kelly said.

While Kelly created a smooth, professional mixture of hip-hop beats, soulman crooning and funk, the most distinctive element of his music is its explicit sensuality. &quot;Sex Me&quot;, &quot;Bump n&#x27; Grind&quot;, &quot;Your Body&#x27;s Callin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Feelin&#x27; on Yo Booty&quot; are considered to be examples, as their productions were seductive enough to sell such blatant come-ons. Kelly&#x27;s crossover appeal was also sustained by his development of a flair for pop balladry.

=== Vocal style and lyrical themes ===
Writing for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in 1997, Nunyo Demasio stated &quot;With a voice that easily shifts from booming baritone to seductive alto, Kelly has gained international celebrity by combining streetwise rhythms with sexually explicit lyrics.&quot; Love and sex are the topics of the majority of Kelly&#x27;s lyrical content, although he has written about a wide variety of themes such as inspiration and spirituality. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reporters Jim DeRogatis and Abdon Pallasch observed about the contrasting themes: &quot;... the image he liked to project was that of the &quot;R&amp;B Thug&quot;... bringing the streetwise persona of the gangsta rapper into the more polite world of R&amp;B.&quot;

Kelly expressed that he writes from everyday experiences and prides himself on being versatile. Larry Khan, senior vice president of Jive&#x27;s urban marketing and promotion, said that Kelly&#x27;s musical compass is second to none. DeRogatis and Pallasch reported that at concerts where Kelly would go from singing &quot;Like a Real Freak&quot; to &quot;I Wish&quot;: &quot;Many fans found these abrupt shifts between the transcendent and the venal, the inspirational and the X-rated jarring.&quot;

=== Influence ===
Kelly is considered to be one of the most successful R&amp;B artists since the mid-1980s. He is also one of the bestselling music artists in the United States, with over 30 million albums sold, as well as only the fifth black artist to enter the top 50 of the same list. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called him &quot;arguably the most important R&amp;B figure of the 1990s and 2000s&quot;. Music executive Barry Weiss described Kelly as &quot;the modern-day Prince, although there&#x27;s a bit of Marvin Gaye in him, and a bit of Irving Berlin&quot;. R. Kelly has also been compared to artists like Sam Cooke and Bobby Brown.

In addition to his solo and collaboration success, Kelly has also written and produced several hit songs, such as &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot; for Aaliyah, &quot;Fortunate&quot; for Maxwell, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; for Michael Jackson, &quot;G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T.&quot; for Changing Faces, &quot;Bump, Bump, Bump&quot; for B2K, and many more.

== Honors and awards ==

Kelly has received and been nominated for multiple awards, as a songwriter, producer, and singer. He won three Grammy Awards for his song &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot;: Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Best Rhythm and Blues Song, and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. After Kelly&#x27;s federal conviction in New York, The Recording Academy stated in 2021 they wouldn&#x27;t strip Kelly of his awards despite his &quot;disturbing&quot; actions.

Kelly was given a key to the city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 2013 as &quot;an artist whose music brings generations together&quot;. On September 30, 2021, following his New York conviction of multiple sex crimes, the key was rescinded.

==Sexual abuse allegations==

Kelly has faced repeated accusations of sexual abuse for incidents dating from 1991 to 2018 and has been the subject of a long-term investigation by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; since August 2000. He has been tried in multiple civil suits and criminal trials, starting in 1996 when Tiffany Hawkins alleged that, starting in 1991 when she was age 15, Kelly, aged 24, had sexual relations with her and encouraged her to entice underaged friends. Following leaked video recordings, Kelly was prosecuted on child pornography charges in 2002, leading to a controversial trial that ended with his acquittal in 2008 on all charges. The 2019 documentary &quot;Surviving R. Kelly&quot; reexamined Kelly&#x27;s alleged sexual misconduct with minors, prompting RCA Records to terminate his contract and resulted in additional investigations by law enforcement beginning in 2019. This culminated in a 2021 conviction for violations of the Mann Act and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and a 2022 conviction for production of child pornography. As of 2023, he is serving a 31-year combined sentence at FCI Butner Medium I. On July 30, 2024, multiple news outlets reported that Kelly, alongside his lawyer Jennifer Bonjean, had asked the Supreme Court to review his child pornography case, which could potentially drop 20 years off his sentence.

=== Other court cases ===
Other than the federal sex abuse cases, Kelly has been involved in several high-profile criminal cases and lawsuits.

==== Criminal ====
* August 13, 1997: Kelly was found guilty of battery and placed on unsupervised probation for one year in Lafayette, Louisiana, as a result of a July 1996 brawl which involved the singer and his entourage. One of the victims needed a total of 110 facial stitches.
* April 8, 1998: Kelly was arrested in Chicago on three misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct, including one charge of violating noise ordinance for playing his music extremely loud from his car, during a test run. He was allegedly confrontational as he was arrested and placed into custody. The vehicle he was testing audio in was impounded and placed on a $500 daily recovery fee. Prosecutors from the district attorney&#x27;s office dropped the first two charges on May 7, and the noise charge on July 22 that year.
* March 6, 2019: Kelly was taken to the Cook County Jail after failing to pay child support in the amount of $161,633 to his former wife, Andrea. Three days later, he was released after someone, whose identity was withheld, paid off the child support on his behalf. His lawyer says he could not discuss the payment due to a gag order.

==== Civil suits ====
* November 1, 2004: Kelly launched a $75 million lawsuit against former friend Jay-Z and several concert organizers and/or promoters for removing him from the &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; tour. The lawsuit for breach of contract, which sought $75 million in damages ($60 million in punitive damages and $15 million for lost income) was a result of not being able to tour. 
* January 2005: Jay-Z countersued the singer, claiming Kelly showed erratic behavior including being late or absent attendances, vacating deadlines, and continued demands or requests that led to several cancellations and resulted in loss of gross. Kelly&#x27;s lawyers challenged it as &quot;inaccurate smears of [Mr. Kelly] that are utterly irrelevant to the issues of the case&quot; but confirmed the rapper&#x27;s refusal to continue work with Kelly after the Madison Square Garden incident and thus broke the contract. Jay-Z&#x27;s counter suit was dismissed by a judge that May.
* November 2005: Kelly sued Jay-Z again, claiming that now Roc Nation executive Tyran &quot;Ty Ty&quot; Smith was awarded with the position of vice president at the artist and repertoire department of Def Jam Recordings (which Jay was president of at the time), as a result of the latter pepper-spraying Kelly on October 29, 2004.

==Personal life==
Kelly&#x27;s mother, Joanne, died from cancer in 1993. He has given conflicting accounts of where he was during his mother&#x27;s death. His oldest daughter, JoAnn (b. 1998), was named after the singer&#x27;s mother, but is also known as Buku Abi.

In 1996, Kelly married Andrea Kelly (née Lee), his former backup dancer and mother of his three children, the aforementioned JoAnn, as well as Jaah (b. 2000), and Robert Jr. (b. 2002). Andrea filed a restraining order against Kelly in September 2005 after a physical altercation, ultimately filing for divorce in 2006. In January 2009, their divorce was finalized after 13 years of marriage. In later years, Andrea accused Kelly of physical, verbal, and mental abuse, including in &quot;Surviving R. Kelly&quot; (2019).

Kelly reportedly had a long relationship with gospel singer Deleon Richards in the 1990s. In 2005, a Chicago man was charged for attempting to extort Richards&#x27; husband, Gary Sheffield, by allegedly threatening to release a sex tape of Richards with an ex-boyfriend, reportedly Kelly. In January 2006, the man was sentenced to 27 months in prison.

===Philanthropy===
In April 2007, Kelly released the song &quot;Rise Up&quot; for Virginia Tech after the 2007 school shooting and donated the net proceeds to the families of the victims. In 2010, he penned the song &quot;Sign of a Victory&quot; for the FIFA World Cup, with all proceeds benefiting African charities. On April 6, 2011, he performed at a charity event in Chicago benefiting Clara&#x27;s House, a facility designed to build employment, housing, health care, and education in the projects of Chicago. In 2016, Kelly donated cases of water to the Flint water crisis.
