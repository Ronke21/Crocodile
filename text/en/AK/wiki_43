<text>In solid-state physics, the work function (sometimes spelled workfunction) is the minimum thermodynamic work (i.e., energy) needed to remove an electron from a solid to a point in the vacuum immediately outside the solid surface. Here &quot;immediately&quot; means that the final electron position is far from the surface on the atomic scale, but still too close to the solid to be influenced by ambient electric fields in the vacuum.
The work function is not a characteristic of a bulk material, but rather a property of the surface of the material (depending on crystal face and contamination).

== Definition ==

The work function for a given surface is defined by the difference
:formula_1
where is the charge of an electron, is the electrostatic potential in the vacuum nearby the surface, and is the Fermi level (electrochemical potential of electrons) inside the material. The term is the energy of an electron at rest in the vacuum nearby the surface.

In practice, one directly controls by the voltage applied to the material through electrodes, and the work function is generally a fixed characteristic of the surface material. Consequently, this means that when a voltage is applied to a material, the electrostatic potential produced in the vacuum will be somewhat lower than the applied voltage, the difference depending on the work function of the material surface. Rearranging the above equation, one has
:formula_2
where is the voltage of the material (as measured by a voltmeter, through an attached electrode), relative to an electrical ground that is defined as having zero Fermi level. The fact that depends on the material surface means that the space between two dissimilar conductors will have a built-in electric field, when those conductors are in total equilibrium with each other (electrically shorted to each other, and with equal temperatures).

The work function refers to removal of an electron to a position that is far enough from the surface (many nm) that the force between the electron and its image charge in the surface can be neglected. The electron must also be close to the surface compared to the nearest edge of a crystal facet, or to any other change in the surface structure, such as a change in the material composition, surface coating or reconstruction. The built-in electric field that results from these structures, and any other ambient electric field present in the vacuum are excluded in defining the work function.

== Applications ==

;Thermionic emission: In thermionic electron guns, the work function and temperature of the hot cathode are critical parameters in determining the amount of current that can be emitted. Tungsten, the common choice for vacuum tube filaments, can survive to high temperatures but its emission is somewhat limited due to its relatively high work function (approximately 4.5 eV). By coating the tungsten with a substance of lower work function (e.g., thorium or barium oxide), the emission can be greatly increased. This prolongs the lifetime of the filament by allowing operation at lower temperatures (for more information, see hot cathode).
;Band bending models in solid-state electronics: The behavior of a solid-state device is strongly dependent on the size of various Schottky barriers and band offsets in the junctions of differing materials, such as metals, semiconductors, and insulators. Some commonly used heuristic approaches to predict the band alignment between materials, such as Anderson&#x27;s rule and the Schottky–Mott rule, are based on the thought experiment of two materials coming together in vacuum, such that the surfaces charge up and adjust their work functions to become equal just before contact. In reality these work function heuristics are inaccurate due to their neglect of numerous microscopic effects. However, they provide a convenient estimate until the true value can be determined by experiment.
;Equilibrium electric fields in vacuum chambers: Variation in work function between different surfaces causes a non-uniform electrostatic potential in the vacuum. Even on an ostensibly uniform surface, variations in known as patch potentials are always present due to microscopic inhomogeneities. Patch potentials have disrupted sensitive apparatus that rely on a perfectly uniform vacuum, such as Casimir force experiments and the Gravity Probe B experiment. Critical apparatus may have surfaces covered with molybdenum, which shows low variations in work function between different crystal faces.
;Contact electrification: If two conducting surfaces are moved relative to each other, and there is potential difference in the space between them, then an electric current will be driven. This is because the surface charge on a conductor depends on the magnitude of the electric field, which in turn depends on the distance between the surfaces. The externally observed electrical effects are largest when the conductors are separated by the smallest distance without touching (once brought into contact, the charge will instead flow internally through the junction between the conductors). Since two conductors in equilibrium can have a built-in potential difference due to work function differences, this means that bringing dissimilar conductors into contact, or pulling them apart, will drive electric currents. These contact currents can damage sensitive microelectronic circuitry and occur even when the conductors would be grounded in the absence of motion.

== Measurement ==

Certain physical phenomena are highly sensitive to the value of the work function. The observed data from these effects can be fitted to simplified theoretical models, allowing one to extract a value of the work function. These phenomenologically extracted work functions may be slightly different from the thermodynamic definition given above. For inhomogeneous surfaces, the work function varies from place to place, and different methods will yield different values of the typical &quot;work function&quot; as they average or select differently among the microscopic work functions.

Many techniques have been developed based on different physical effects to measure the electronic work function of a sample. One may distinguish between two groups of experimental methods for work function measurements: absolute and relative.

* Absolute methods employ electron emission from the sample induced by photon absorption (photoemission), by high temperature (thermionic emission), due to an electric field (field electron emission), or using electron tunnelling.
* Relative methods make use of the contact potential difference between the sample and a reference electrode. Experimentally, either an anode current of a diode is used or the displacement current between the sample and reference, created by an artificial change in the capacitance between the two, is measured (the Kelvin Probe method, Kelvin probe force microscope). However, absolute work function values can be obtained if the tip is first calibrated against a reference sample.

=== Methods based on thermionic emission ===

The work function is important in the theory of thermionic emission, where thermal fluctuations provide enough energy to &quot;evaporate&quot; electrons out of a hot material (called the &#x27;emitter&#x27;) into the vacuum. If these electrons are absorbed by another, cooler material (called the &quot;collector&quot;) then a measurable electric current will be observed. Thermionic emission can be used to measure the work function of both the hot emitter and cold collector. Generally, these measurements involve fitting to Richardson&#x27;s law, and so they must be carried out in a low temperature and low current regime where space charge effects are absent.

In order to move from the hot emitter to the vacuum, an electron&#x27;s energy must exceed the emitter Fermi level by an amount
:formula_3
determined simply by the thermionic work function of the emitter.
If an electric field is applied towards the surface of the emitter, then all of the escaping electrons will be accelerated away from the emitter and absorbed into whichever material is applying the electric field.
According to Richardson&#x27;s law the emitted current density (per unit area of emitter), &quot;J&quot;e (A/m2), is related to the absolute temperature &quot;T&quot;e of the emitter by the equation:
:formula_4
where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant and the proportionality constant &quot;A&quot;e is the Richardson&#x27;s constant of the emitter.
In this case, the dependence of &quot;J&quot;e on &quot;T&quot;e can be fitted to yield &quot;W&quot;e.

==== Work function of cold electron collector ====
The same setup can be used to instead measure the work function in the collector, simply by adjusting the applied voltage.
If an electric field is applied &quot;away from&quot; the emitter instead, then most of the electrons coming from the emitter will simply be reflected back to the emitter. Only the highest energy electrons will have enough energy to reach the collector, and the height of the potential barrier in this case depends on the collector&#x27;s work function, rather than the emitter&#x27;s.

The current is still governed by Richardson&#x27;s law. However, in this case the barrier height does not depend on &quot;W&quot;e. The barrier height now depends on the work function of the collector, as well as any additional applied voltages:
:formula_5
where &quot;W&quot;c is the collector&#x27;s thermionic work function, Δ&quot;V&quot;ce is the applied collector–emitter voltage, and Δ&quot;V&quot;S is the Seebeck voltage in the hot emitter (the influence of Δ&quot;V&quot;S is often omitted, as it is a small contribution of order 10 mV).
The resulting current density &quot;J&quot;c through the collector (per unit of collector area) is again given by Richardson&#x27;s Law, except now
:formula_6
where &quot;A&quot; is a Richardson-type constant that depends on the collector material but may also depend on the emitter material, and the diode geometry.
In this case, the dependence of &quot;J&quot;c on &quot;T&quot;e, or on Δ&quot;V&quot;ce, can be fitted to yield &quot;W&quot;c.

This retarding potential method is one of the simplest and oldest methods of measuring work functions, and is advantageous since the measured material (collector) is not required to survive high temperatures.

=== Methods based on photoemission ===

The photoelectric work function is the minimum photon energy required to liberate an electron from a substance, in the photoelectric effect.
If the photon&#x27;s energy is greater than the substance&#x27;s work function, photoelectric emission occurs and the electron is liberated from the surface.
Similar to the thermionic case described above, the liberated electrons can be extracted into a collector and produce a detectable current, if an electric field is applied into the surface of the emitter.
Excess photon energy results in a liberated electron with non-zero kinetic energy.
It is expected that the minimum photon energy formula_7 required to liberate an electron (and generate a current) is 
:formula_8
where &quot;W&quot;e is the work function of the emitter.

Photoelectric measurements require a great deal of care, as an incorrectly designed experimental geometry can result in an erroneous measurement of work function. This may be responsible for the large variation in work function values in scientific literature.
Moreover, the minimum energy can be misleading in materials where there are no actual electron states at the Fermi level that are available for excitation. For example, in a semiconductor the minimum photon energy would actually correspond to the valence band edge rather than work function.

Of course, the photoelectric effect may be used in the retarding mode, as with the thermionic apparatus described above. In the retarding case, the dark collector&#x27;s work function is measured instead.

=== Kelvin probe method ===


The Kelvin probe technique relies on the detection of an electric field (gradient in &quot;ϕ&quot;) between a sample material and probe material.
The electric field can be varied by the voltage Δ&quot;V&quot;sp that is applied to the probe relative to the sample.
If the voltage is chosen such that the electric field is eliminated (the flat vacuum condition), then
:formula_9
Since the experimenter controls and knows Δ&quot;V&quot;sp, then finding the flat vacuum condition gives directly the work function difference between the two materials.
The only question is, how to detect the flat vacuum condition?
Typically, the electric field is detected by varying the distance between the sample and probe. When the distance is changed but Δ&quot;V&quot;sp is held constant, a current will flow due to the change in capacitance. This current is proportional to the vacuum electric field, and so when the electric field is neutralized no current will flow.

Although the Kelvin probe technique only measures a work function difference, it is possible to obtain an absolute work function by first calibrating the probe against a reference material (with known work function) and then using the same probe to measure a desired sample.
The Kelvin probe technique can be used to obtain work function maps of a surface with extremely high spatial resolution, by using a sharp tip for the probe (see Kelvin probe force microscope).

== Work functions of elements ==
The work function depends on the configurations of atoms at the surface of the material. For example, on polycrystalline silver the work function is 4.26 eV, but on silver crystals it varies for different crystal faces as (100) face: 4.64 eV, (110) face: 4.52 eV, (111) face: 4.74 eV. Ranges for typical surfaces are shown in the table below.

== Physical factors that determine the work function ==
Due to the complications described in the modelling section below, it is difficult to theoretically predict the work function with accuracy. However, various trends have been identified. The work function tends to be smaller for metals with an open lattice, and larger for metals in which the atoms are closely packed. It is somewhat higher on dense crystal faces than open crystal faces, also depending on surface reconstructions for the given crystal face.

=== Surface dipole ===
The work function is not simply dependent on the &quot;internal vacuum level&quot; inside the material (i.e., its average electrostatic potential), because of the formation of an atomic-scale electric double layer at the surface. This surface electric dipole gives a jump in the electrostatic potential between the material and the vacuum.

A variety of factors are responsible for the surface electric dipole. Even with a completely clean surface, the electrons can spread slightly into the vacuum, leaving behind a slightly positively charged layer of material. This primarily occurs in metals, where the bound electrons do not encounter a hard wall potential at the surface but rather a gradual ramping potential due to image charge attraction. The amount of surface dipole depends on the detailed layout of the atoms at the surface of the material, leading to the variation in work function for different crystal faces.

=== Doping and electric field effect (semiconductors) ===
In a semiconductor, the work function is sensitive to the doping level at the surface of the semiconductor. Since the doping near the surface can also be controlled by electric fields, the work function of a semiconductor is also sensitive to the electric field in the vacuum.

The reason for the dependence is that, typically, the vacuum level and the conduction band edge retain a fixed spacing independent of doping. This spacing is called the electron affinity (note that this has a different meaning than the electron affinity of chemistry); in silicon for example the electron affinity is 4.05 eV. If the electron affinity &quot;E&quot;EA and the surface&#x27;s band-referenced Fermi level &quot;E&quot;F-&quot;E&quot;C are known, then the work function is given by
:formula_10
where &quot;E&quot;C is taken at the surface.

From this one might expect that by doping the bulk of the semiconductor, the work function can be tuned. In reality, however, the energies of the bands near the surface are often pinned to the Fermi level, due to the influence of surface states. If there is a large density of surface states, then the work function of the semiconductor will show a very weak dependence on doping or electric field.

=== Theoretical models of metal work functions ===
Theoretical modeling of the work function is difficult, as an accurate model requires a careful treatment of both electronic many body effects and surface chemistry; both of these topics are already complex in their own right.

One of the earliest successful models for metal work function trends was the jellium model, which allowed for oscillations in electronic density nearby the abrupt surface (these are similar to Friedel oscillations) as well as the tail of electron density extending outside the surface. This model showed why the density of conduction electrons (as represented by the Wigner–Seitz radius &quot;rs&quot;) is an important parameter in determining work function.

The jellium model is only a partial explanation, as its predictions still show significant deviation from real work functions. More recent models have focused on including more accurate forms of electron exchange and correlation effects, as well as including the crystal face dependence (this requires the inclusion of the actual atomic lattice, something that is neglected in the jellium model).

=== Temperature dependence of the electron work function ===
The electron behavior in metals varies with temperature and is largely reflected by the electron work function. A theoretical model for predicting the temperature dependence of the electron work function, developed by Rahemi et al. explains the underlying mechanism and predicts this temperature dependence for various crystal structures via calculable and measurable parameters. In general, as the temperature increases, the EWF decreases via formula_11 and formula_12 is a calculable material property which is dependent on the crystal structure (for example, BCC, FCC). formula_13 is the electron work function at T=0 and formula_14 is constant throughout the change.

<text>The Empire Strikes Back (also known as Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back) is a 1980 American epic space opera film directed by Irvin Kershner from a screenplay by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, based on a story by George Lucas. The sequel to &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), it is the second film in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series and the fifth chronological chapter of the &quot;Skywalker Saga&quot;. Set three years after the events of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the film recounts the battle between the malevolent Galactic Empire, led by the Emperor, and the Rebel Alliance, led by Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. As the Empire goes on the offensive, Luke trains to master the Force so he can confront the Emperor&#x27;s powerful disciple, Darth Vader. The ensemble cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz.

Following the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Lucas hired Brackett to write the sequel. After she died in 1978, he outlined the whole &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga and wrote the next draft himself, before hiring &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) writer Kasdan to enhance his work. To avoid the stress he faced directing &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Lucas handed the responsibility to Kershner and focused on expanding his special effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic instead. Filmed from March to September 1979 in Finse, Norway, and at Elstree Studios in England, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; faced production difficulties, including actor injuries, illnesses, fires, and problems securing additional financing as costs rose. Initially budgeted at $8million, costs had risen to $30.5million by the project&#x27;s conclusion.

Released on May 21, 1980, the highly anticipated sequel became the highest-grossing film that year, earning approximately $401.5million worldwide. Unlike its lighthearted predecessor, &quot;Empire&quot; met with mixed reviews from critics, and fans were conflicted about its darker and more mature themes. The film was nominated for various awards and won two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, and a BAFTA, among others. Subsequent releases have raised the film&#x27;s worldwide gross to $538–549million and, adjusted for inflation, it is the 13th-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada.

Since its release, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; has been critically reassessed and is now often regarded as the best film in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series and among the greatest films ever made. It has had a significant impact on filmmaking and popular culture and is often considered an example of a sequel superior to its predecessor. The climax, in which Vader reveals he is Luke&#x27;s father, is often ranked as one of the greatest plot twists in cinema. The film spawned a variety of merchandise and adaptations, including video games and a radio play. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2010. &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) followed &quot;Empire&quot;, concluding the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. Prequel and sequel trilogies have since been released.

== Plot ==

Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, the Imperial fleet, led by Darth Vader, dispatches probe droids across the galaxy in search for the Rebel Alliance. One probe locates the rebel base on the ice planet Hoth. While Luke Skywalker is scouting near the base, a wampa captures him before he can investigate a meteorite, but he escapes by using the Force to retrieve his lightsaber and wound the beast. Before Luke succumbs to hypothermia, the Force spirit of his deceased mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the swamp planet Dagobah to train as a Jedi Knight under the Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo discovers Luke and insulates him against the weather inside his deceased tauntaun mount until they are rescued the next morning.

Alerted to the Rebels&#x27; location, the Empire launches a large-scale attack using AT-AT walkers, forcing the Rebels to evacuate the base. Han, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca escape aboard the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, but the ship&#x27;s hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer amid the tension. Vader summons several bounty hunters, including Boba Fett, to find the &quot;Falcon&quot;. Evading the Imperial fleet, Han&#x27;s group travels to the floating Cloud City on the gas planet Bespin, which is governed by his old friend Lando Calrissian. Fett tracks them there, and Vader forces Lando to surrender the group to the Empire, knowing Luke will come to their aid.

Meanwhile, Luke travels with in his X-wing fighter to Dagobah, where he crash-lands. He meets Yoda, a diminutive creature who reluctantly accepts him as his Jedi apprentice after conferring with Obi-Wan&#x27;s spirit. Yoda trains Luke to master the light side of the Force and resist negative emotions that will seduce him to the dark side, as they did Vader. Luke struggles to control his anger and impulsiveness and fails to comprehend the nature and power of the Force until he witnesses Yoda use it to levitate the X-wing from the swamp. Luke has a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, despite Obi-Wan&#x27;s and Yoda&#x27;s protestations, abandons his training to rescue them. Although Obi-Wan believes Luke is their only hope, Yoda asserts that &quot;there is another.&quot;

Leia confesses her love for Han before Vader freezes him in carbonite to test whether the process will safely imprison Luke. Han survives and is given to Fett, who intends to collect his bounty from Jabba the Hutt. Lando frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett&#x27;s escape. The group fights its way back to the &quot;Falcon&quot; and flees the city. Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel over the city&#x27;s central air shaft. Vader defeats Luke, severing his right hand and separating him from his lightsaber. He urges Luke to embrace the dark side and help him destroy his master, the Emperor, so they may rule the galaxy together. Luke refuses, citing Obi-Wan&#x27;s claim that Vader killed his father, prompting Vader to reveal that he is Luke&#x27;s father. Distraught, Luke plunges down the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, latching onto an antenna. He reaches out through the Force to Leia, and the &quot;Falcon&quot; returns to rescue him. They are attacked by TIE fighters but narrowly evade capture by Vader&#x27;s Star Destroyer when repairs the &quot;Falcon&quot;″s hyperdrive and the vessel escapes.

After the group joins the rebel fleet, Luke&#x27;s missing hand is replaced by a robotic prosthesis. He, Leia, , and observe as Lando and Chewbacca depart on the &quot;Falcon&quot; to find Han.

=== Development ===
Following the unexpected financial success and cultural impact of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), a sequel was swiftly put into production. In case &quot;Star Wars&quot; had failed, creator George Lucas had contracted Alan Dean Foster to write a low-budget sequel (later released as the novel &quot;Splinter of the Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;). Once the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; was evident, Lucas was reluctant to direct the sequel because of the stress of making the first film and its impact on his health. The popularity of &quot;Star Wars&quot; brought Lucas wealth, fame and positive attention from the public, but it also brought negative attention in the form of threats and many requests for financial backing.

Conscious that the sequel needed to exceed the original&#x27;s scope—making it a bigger production—and that his production effects company Lucasfilm was relatively small and operating out of a makeshift office, Lucas considered selling the project to 20th Century-Fox in exchange for a profit percentage. He had profited substantially from &quot;Star Wars&quot; and did not need to work, but was too invested in his creation to entrust it to others. Lucas had concepts for the sequel but no solid structure. He knew the story would be darker, would explore more mature themes and relationships, and would continue to explore the nature of the Force. Lucas intended to fund the production independently, using his $12million profit from &quot;Star Wars&quot; to relocate and expand his special effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) and establish his Skywalker movie ranch in Marin County, California, with the remainder as collateral for a loan from Bank of America for the film&#x27;s $8million budget.

Fox had the right of first negotiation and refusal to participate in any potential sequel. Negotiations began in mid-1977 between the studio and Lucas&#x27;s representatives. Fox had already given Lucas controlling interest in the series&#x27; merchandising and sequels because it had thought &quot;Star Wars&quot; would be worthless. Terms were agreed quickly for the sequel compared to the original, in part because Fox executive Alan Ladd Jr. had been supportive of the original and was eager for the sequel. The 100-page contract was signed on September 21, 1977, dictating that Fox would distribute the film but have no creative input, in exchange for 50% of the gross profits on the first $20million earned, with the percentage increasing to 77.5% in the producers&#x27; favor if it exceeded $100million. Filming had to begin by January 1979 for release on May 1, 1980. The deal offered the possibility of significant financial gain for Lucas, but he risked financial ruin if the sequel failed.

To mitigate some of the risk, Lucas founded The Chapter II Company to control the film&#x27;s development and absorb its liabilities. He signed a contract between the company and Lucasfilm, granting himself 5% of the box office gross profits. He also founded Black Falcon to license &quot;Star Wars&quot; merchandising rights, using the income to subsidize his ongoing projects. Development for the sequel began in August 1977, under the title &quot;Star Wars Chapter II&quot;.

Lucas considered replacing producer Gary Kurtz with Howard Kazanjian because Kurtz had not fulfilled his role and left problems unresolved while filming &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Kurtz convinced him otherwise by trading on his longtime loyalty to Lucas and knowledge of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; property. Lucas took an executive producer role, enabling him to focus on his businesses and the development of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). By late 1977, Kurtz began hiring key crew members, including production designer Norman Reynolds, consultant John Barry, makeup artist Stuart Freeborn, and first assistant director David Tomblin. Lucas rehired artists Ralph McQuarrie and Joe Johnston to maintain visual consistency with &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and the three began conceptualizing the Hoth battle in December. By this point, the budget had increased to $10million. Lucas wanted a director who would support the material and accept that he was ultimately in charge. He considered around 100 directors, including Alan Parker and John Badham, before hiring his old acquaintance Irvin Kershner in February 1978. Kershner was reluctant to direct the sequel to a film as successful as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and his friends warned him against taking the job, believing he would be blamed if it failed. Lucas convinced Kershner it was not so much a sequel as a chapter in a larger story; he also promised him he could make the film his own way.

=== Writing ===
Lucas began formulating ideas in August 1977. These included the Emperor, Luke&#x27;s lost sister, and an explanation of facial injuries Hamill had suffered from an accident after filming &quot;Star Wars&quot; (Lucas told Hamill that, had he died, his character would have been replaced, not recast). Hamill recounted being told the sister character might be Leia, which he found disappointing. Lucas had written &quot;Star Wars&quot; but did not enjoy developing lore for an original universe. Science-fiction writer Leigh Brackett, whom Lucas met through a friend, excelled in quick-paced dialogue. He hired her for $50,000, aware that she had cancer.

Between November28 and December2, 1977, Lucas and Brackett held a story conference. Lucas had core ideas in mind but wanted Brackett to piece them together. He envisioned one central plot complemented by three main subplots, set across 60 scenes, 100 script pages, and a two-hour runtime. They formed a general outline and ideas that included the Wookiee homeworld, new alien species, the Galactic Emperor, a gambler from Han&#x27;s past, water and city planets, Luke&#x27;s lost twin sister, and a diminutive, froglike creature, Minch Yoda. Lucas drew on influences including &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951), the novel &quot;Dune&quot; (1965), and the television series &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1954). Around this time, Kurtz conceived the title &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. He said they avoided calling it &quot;Star Wars II&quot; because films with &quot;II&quot; in their titles were seen as inferior.

Brackett completed her first draft in February 1978, titled &quot;Star Wars sequel, from the adventures of Luke Skywalker&quot;. The draft contained a city in the clouds, a chase through an asteroid belt, a greater focus on the love triangle between Luke, Han, and Leia (who is portrayed as a damsel in distress), the battle of Hoth and a climactic duel between Luke and Darth Vader. The ghosts of his father and Obi-Wan visit Luke, leaving Vader a separate character. The draft reveals Luke has a sister (not Leia), Han goes on a mission to recruit his powerful stepfather, and Lando is a clone from the Clone Wars. Lucas made detailed notes and attempted to contact Brackett, but she had been hospitalized, and died of cancer a few weeks later, on March 18.

=== Rewrite ===
The strict schedule left Lucas no choice but to write the second draft himself. Though Brackett&#x27;s draft followed Lucas&#x27;s outline, he found she had portrayed the characters differently than he intended. Lucas completed his handwritten, 121-page draft on April 1. He found the process more enjoyable than on &quot;Star Wars&quot; because he was familiar with the universe, but struggled to write a satisfying conclusion, leaving it open for a third film. This draft established Luke&#x27;s sister as a new character undertaking a similar journey, Vader&#x27;s castle and his fear of the emperor, distinct power levels in controlling the Force, Yoda&#x27;s unconventional speech pattern, and bounty hunters, including Boba Fett. Lucas wrote Fett like the Man with No Name, combining him with an abandoned idea for a Super Stormtrooper. Lucas&#x27;s handwritten draft included mention of Vader being Luke&#x27;s father, but the typed script omitted this revelation. Despite contradictory information in drafts that included the ghost of Luke&#x27;s father, Lucas said he had always intended for Vader to be Luke&#x27;s father and omitted it from scripts to avoid leaks. Lucas included elements such as Han&#x27;s debt to Jabba, and recontextualized Luke leaving Dagobah to rescue his friends: in Brackett&#x27;s draft, Obi-Wan instructs Luke to leave; Lucas had Luke choose to do so. He also removed a scene of Luke massacring stormtroopers to convey him falling to the dark side, wanting to instead explore this in the next film. Lucas believed it was important the characters be inspirational and appropriate for children. His typed draft is titled &quot;Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

In June 1978, impressed with his work on &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, Lucas hired Lawrence Kasdan to refine the draft; Kasdan was paid $60,000. In early July, Kasdan, Kershner and Lucas held a story conference to discuss Lucas&#x27;s draft. The group collaborated on ideas, with Lucas embracing their challenges and input. Mandated to deliver a fifth of the script every other week, Kasdan began his rewrite, focusing on developing character relationships and psychologies; he completed the third draft by early August. This version refined Minch Yoda—alternately named &quot;the Critter&quot;, Minch, Buffy, and simply Yoda—from a slimy creature to a small blue one; each version retained the character&#x27;s long life and wisdom. Yoda was intended to teach Luke to respect everyone and not judge by appearances, and defy audience expectations. The draft tightened or expanded dialogue to better pace action scenes, added more romance, and added or changed locations, such as moving a Vader scene from a spaceship deck to his private cubicle. Lucas removed a line mentioning Lando deliberately abandoning his people, and had Luke contact Leia through the Force instead of Obi-Wan&#x27;s ghost. The fourth draft—mostly the same but with more detailed action—was submitted on October 24.

Although some of Brackett&#x27;s ideas remained, such as Luke&#x27;s Dagobah training, her dialogue and characterization were removed. Kasdan described her take as from &quot;a different era&quot;, lacking the necessary tone. Kazanjian did not believe the Writers Guild of America West would approve of her receiving credit, but Lucas liked Brackett and supported her credit as co-writer. He also provided for her family beyond her contracted pay. The fifth draft was completed in February 1979. It revised some scenes and introduced a &quot;Hogmen&quot; species devised by Kershner; Lucas did not like the idea because he perceived them as slaves.

=== Casting ===

Mark Hamill (Luke), Carrie Fisher (Leia), Harrison Ford (Han), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), and Kenny Baker (R2-D2) all reprised their &quot;Star Wars&quot; roles. Hamill and Fisher were contracted for a second, third, and fourth film, but Ford had declined similar terms because of earlier bad experiences; he agreed to return because he wanted to improve on his &quot;Star Wars&quot; performance. Hamill spent four months bodybuilding and learning karate, fencing, and kendo to prepare for his stunts.

David Prowse hesitated to return as Darth Vader because, as he was hidden behind a costume, he believed the role offered little job security; he returned after being told further delays would lead to his being replaced. James Earl Jones returned to voice Vader but, as with &quot;Star Wars&quot;, declined a credit because he considered himself &quot;special effects&quot; to Prowse&#x27;s physical performance. He earned $15,000 for half a day&#x27;s work, plus a small percentage of the profits. Anthony Daniels was reluctant to return as because he had received little acknowledgment for his previous performance, as the filmmakers played down his involvement to portray the droid as a real being. He ultimately agreed, however, for an improved salary. Alec Guinness said he could not return as Obi-Wan because his failing eyesight required him to avoid bright lights. Recasting him was considered but, determined to recruit him, Lucas agreed to a deal in late August 1979 which gave him a more limited role. Guinness was paid 0.25% of &quot;Empire&quot;″s box office gross for his few hours of work.

Billy Dee Williams was cast as Lando Calrissian, making him the first black actor with a starring role in the series. He found the character interesting because of his cape and Armenian surname; Williams believed this gave him room to develop the character. Williams said Lando was much like himself—a &quot;pretty cool guy&quot;. He believed it was a token role, but was assured it was not specifically written for a black actor. Kershner said Williams had the fantastic charm of a &quot;Mississippi riverboat hustler&quot;. Howard Rollins, Terry Alexander, Robert Christian, Thurman Scott, and Yaphet Kotto were also considered for the part. Yoda was voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz, with assistance from Kathryn Mullen, David Barclay, and Wendy Froud. Lucas had intended for a different actor to provide Yoda&#x27;s voice, but decided it would be too difficult to cast someone who could match their voice to Oz&#x27;s puppetry.

Jeremy Bulloch did not audition for Boba Fett; he was hired because the costume fit him. It was uncomfortable and top-heavy, making it difficult to maintain his balance, and the mask often steamed up. Bulloch assumed his lines would be dubbed over, as he had little dialogue (Fett&#x27;s voice actor, Jason Wingreen, remained uncredited until 2000). Bulloch also appears as an Imperial officer who restrains Leia on Bespin. No other cast member was available for this role, so Kurtz had him quickly change out of the Fett costume to stand in. John Morton portrays Fett in the same scene. There was no extensive casting for the Emperor. Lucas chose Clive Revill to provide the character&#x27;s voice, and actress Marjorie Eaton physically portrayed the Emperor in test footage. The footage proved unsatisfactory, and special effects artist Rick Baker created a full mask that his wife Elaine wore. Chimpanzee eyes were superimposed over her face; cat eyes and assistant accountant Laura Crockett&#x27;s eyes were also considered.
=== Pre-production ===
Pre-production began in early 1978. Although Kershner wanted two years, this phase only lasted a year. Seeking an area to represent the ice planet Hoth, location scouts considered Finland, Sweden, and the Arctic Circle. The location needed to be free of trees and near populated areas for amenities. Kershner credited a Fox distribution employee with recommending Finse, Norway; Kurtz said it was Reynolds who had done so. For the bog planet Dagobah, scouts looked at Central Africa, Kenya, and Scandinavia, but Lucas wanted to avoid shooting on location. He funded the construction of a &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; stage&quot; at Elstree Studios, London, for the Dagobah and rebel base sets. Construction for the stage—which measured and cost $2million—began at the end of August. Sets were the single biggest expense of the production, costing a total of $3.5million. By December, the budget had increased to $21.5million, more than double the original estimate. Financial projections for The Chapter II Company suggested it would run a monthly deficit of $5–25million by the end of 1979, including over $2million in production costs and $400,000 to fund ILM.

As the start of filming in January 1979 loomed, a fire on Elstree&#x27;s Stage 3—where &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980) was being filmed—destroyed the space planned for &quot;Empire&quot;″s sets. The impact was significant, resulting in the &quot;Empire&quot; production being forced to give up two stages so &quot;The Shining&quot; could continue filming. Sixty-four sets had to be moved through nine stages and the filming schedule had to be altered. Poor weather delayed construction of necessary sets, props, and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; stage. By February 25, the Finse location crew had arrived in Norway to receive flown-in equipment containers and begin digging trenches for battle scenes.

=== Music ===

The musical score for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was composed and conducted by John Williams and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, at a cost of about $250,000. Williams began planning the score in November 1979, estimating the film would require 107 minutes of music. For two weeks across 18 three-hour sessions just after Christmas, Williams recorded the score at Anvil Studios and Abbey Road Studios, London. Up to 104 musicians were involved at a time, playing such instruments as oboes, piccolos, pianos, and harps.

== Filming ==
=== Commencement in Norway ===

Principal photography began on March 5, 1979, on the Hardangerjøkulen glacier near Finse, Norway, representing the planet Hoth. Initially scheduled to conclude on June 22, by the end of the first week it was obvious it would take longer and cost more.

Filming the Hoth scenes on a set was considered, but ultimately rejected as inauthentic. The location filming coincided with the area&#x27;s worst snowstorm in half a century, impeding the production with blizzards, winds, and temperatures between and . The weather cleared only twice; some days, filming could not take place. The frigid conditions made the acetate film brittle, camera lenses iced over, snow seeped into equipment, and effects paint froze inside the tin. To counter these effects, lenses were kept cool but the camera body was warmed to protect the film, battery, and camera operators&#x27; hands. The crew was outside for up to 11 hours at a time, being subjected to thin air, limited visibility, and mild frostbite; one crewman slipped and broke two ribs. The difficult conditions led to strong camaraderie among crewmembers.

Avalanches blocked direct transport links, and trenches dug by the crew quickly filled with snow. Scenes could be prepared only a few hours in advance and many scenes were filmed just outside the crew&#x27;s hotel as the shifting weather regularly altered the scenery. Although Fisher was not scheduled to film scenes in Norway, she joined Hamill on location because she wanted to observe the process. Ford was not scheduled for the Finse phase, but to compensate for the delays, he was brought there instead of creating a separate set in a Leeds studio. On a few hours&#x27; notice, he arrived in Finse, having traveled the last of the snow-laden journey by snowplow. Production returned to England after a week, though Hamill had an additional day of filming. The second unit remained in Norway through March to film explosions, incidental footage, and battle scenes featuring 35 mountain rescue skiers as extras. The skiers&#x27; work was compensated with a donation to the Norwegian Red Cross.

To film the Imperial probe landing, eight sticks of dynamite were placed on the glacier and set to explode at sunrise, but the demolitions expert in charge knocked the battery out of his radio and received the message too late to capture the intended shot. The opening sweeping shot of the area was captured by flying a helicopter to and performing a controlled drop at a rate of or a minute. A heated shelter for the helicopter had to be constructed, which delayed filming of the shot by four weeks. The second unit, scheduled to be in Finse for three weeks, was there for eight. When the crew returned to London, they had only half the planned footage, and background images for special effects shots were uneven. &quot;Empire&quot;″s budget increased to around $22million because of the delays and having to rework scenes to compensate for the missing footage.

=== Filming at Elstree Studios ===

Filming at Elstree began on March 13, 1979. Production remained behind schedule without Stage 3 (which had been destroyed by fire), and the incomplete &quot;Star Wars&quot; stage lacked protection from the cold weather. The result was that the crew had to work out of any available space. To save time, some scenes were shot simultaneously, such as those set in the ice cavern and medical bay. Kershner wanted each character to make a unique entrance in the film. While filming Vader&#x27;s entrance, the snow troopers preceding Prowse tripped over the polystyrene ice, and the stuntman behind him stood on his cape, breaking it off, causing Prowse to fall onto the snow troopers.

The shoot was strenuous and mired in conflicts. Fisher suffered from influenza and bronchitis, her weight dropped to while working 12-hour days, and she collapsed on set from an allergic reaction to steam or spray paint. She was also allergic to most makeup. Her overuse of hallucinogens and painkillers worsened her condition, as did the anxiety she experienced while performing her speech to the rebels. Stress and personal traumas led to frequent arguments among Hamill, Fisher, and Ford. Ford and Hamill fell ill or were injured at different times. Hamill was depressed by his isolation from human cast members, as his scenes required him to interact mostly with puppets, robots, and actors whose voices would be added later or dubbed over. He was meant to use an earpiece to hear Oz&#x27;s Yoda dialogue, but for various reasons this did not work, and he struggled to form a relationship with the character. The Dagobah set was liberally sprayed with mineral oil, which caused him physical discomfort for long periods. Hamill called it a &quot;physical ordeal the whole time... but I don&#x27;t really mind that&quot;. At one point, Oz cheered Hamill up with a Miss Piggy routine. Hamill recalled Ford giving him a kiss instead of reading his lines, which entertained the crew. Mayhew fell ill while filming Han&#x27;s torture scene because the set used bursts of steam, which raised the ambient temperature to while he was wearing a wool suit.

Bank of America representatives visited the set in late March, concerned about rising costs. Lucas rarely visited the set, but arrived on May 6 after realizing the production was behind schedule and over budget. An official Lucasfilm memo instructed staff to misstate the film&#x27;s direct costs as $17million. At this point, Kurtz and Lucas estimated it would cost $25–28million to complete filming. Finances ran out in mid-July when Bank of America refused to increase the loan. The crisis was kept from the crew, including Kershner, and tactics were used to delay its impact, including paying staff biweekly instead of weekly and Lucas borrowing money from his merchandising company Black Falcon. Lucas worried he would have to sell &quot;Empire&quot; and its associated rights to Fox to sustain the project, losing his creative freedom. Fox was also threatening to buy out the bond and take over filming. With about 20% of &quot;Empire&quot; left to film, Lucasfilm president Charles Weber arranged for Bank of Boston to refinance the loan to $31million, including $27.7million from Bank of Boston and $3million guaranteed by Fox in exchange for an increased percentage of the theatrical returns and 10% of merchandising profits. Lucasfilm took out the loan, making the company directly liable.

The &quot;Star Wars&quot; stage was completed in early May. It was too small to house the Rebel hangar and Dagobah sets, and an extension had to be funded and built. The producers mandated filming begin on the stage on May 18, regardless of its state. The hangar scene involved 77 rebel extras, which cost £2,000 per day. Around of dendritic salt, mixed with magnesium sulfate for a sparkle effect, were used for the snowy sets; this combination of substances gave the cast and crew headaches. Second unit director John Barry died suddenly in early June; Harley Cokeliss replaced him a week later. The typical purpose of the second unit was to do time-consuming filming for special effects shots, but they were now filming main scenes—including Luke&#x27;s ice cave imprisonment—because the schedule had overrun by around 26 days. Hamill was unavailable for several days after injuring his hand during a stunt jump from a speeder bike. Having been called in for the stunt the same day his son was born, aggravated by the salt-laden setting, and exhausted, he angrily chastised Kurtz for not using a double for the scene. Kershner&#x27;s hands-on directing style, which included him acting out how he wanted a scene performed, agitated Hamill; Kershner, for his part, was frustrated that Hamill was not following his advice.

The life-size hangar set was dismantled in mid-June to allow the construction of other sets around the full-scale &quot;Millenium Falcon&quot;. These scenes had to be filmed efficiently, so the &quot;Falcon&quot; could be dismantled to make way for the Dagobah set. Filming began on the carbon chamber scene in late June while the second unit filmed anything they could. The raised set was largely incomplete, and low lighting and steam were used to conceal any obvious flaws. The fog machines and heat from the steam made many cast and crew members sick; it took approximately three weeks to film. The confession of love between Leia and Han was scripted with both of them admitting their feelings for the other. Kershner felt this was too &quot;sappy&quot;. He had Ford improvise lines repeatedly until Ford said he would do only one more take; his response to Leia&#x27;s confession of love in the final take was &quot;I know&quot;. By the end of the month, cast and crew morale was low.

=== The duel, Dagobah, and conclusion ===

Hamill returned in early July to film his climactic battle against Darth Vader, portrayed by stunt double Bob Anderson, who said the experience was like fighting blindfolded because of the costume. Hamill spent weeks practicing his fencing routine, eventually growing frustrated and refusing to continue. The next scene, where Vader confesses he is Luke&#x27;s father, was shrouded in secrecy. Prowse was given the line &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi is your father&quot; to read because he was known for repeatedly leaking information. Only Kershner, the producers, and Hamill knew the actual line. While filming the scene, Hamill was positioned on a platform suspended above a pile of mattresses. Footage of his fall into the reactor shaft was damaged during processing and the scene had to be reshot in early August. The Vader confrontation took eight weeks to film. Hamill insisted on doing as many of his stunts as possible, though the insurers refused to allow him to perform a fall out of a window. He accidentally fell from a nine-inch ledge high but rolled on landing to avoid injury. Lucas returned to the set on July 15 and stayed for the rest of filming. He rewrote Luke&#x27;s scenes on Dagobah, removing or trimming them so they could be shot in just over two weeks.

Most of the cast completed filming by the start of August, including Ford, Fisher, Williams, Mayhew, and Daniels. Hamill began filming on the Dagobah set with Yoda. They only had 12 days to film because Oz was scheduled for another project. With the film now over 50 days behind schedule, Kurtz was removed from his role and replaced by Kazanjian and associate producer Robert Watts. One of the last scenes shot was of Luke exploring the dark side tree on Dagobah. A wrap party was held on the set to mark the official conclusion of filming on September 5, 1979, after 133 days. Guinness filmed his scenes against a bluescreen the same day. Kershner and the second unit continued filming additional footage, including Luke&#x27;s X-Wing being raised from the swamp. Kershner left the set on September 9, and Hamill finished 103 days of filming two days later. The second unit finished filming on September 24 with Hamill&#x27;s stunt double. There was approximately of film, or 80 hours of footage.

The final budget was $30.5million. Kurtz blamed inflation, which had increased resource, cast, and crew costs significantly. Lucas blamed Kurtz for lack of oversight and poor financial planning. Watts said Kurtz was not good with people and never developed a working relationship with Kershner, making it difficult for him to temper the director&#x27;s indulgences. Kurtz had also given Kershner more leeway because of the delays caused by the Stage 3 fire. Kershner&#x27;s slower work pace had frustrated Lucas. He described his filming style as frugal, performing two or three takes with little coverage film that could later compensate for mistakes. Watts and Reynolds said Kershner often looked at new ways of doing things, but this required planning that only delayed things further. Kershner had tried replicating the quick pacing of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, not lingering on any scene for too long, and encouraged improvisation, modifying scenes and dialogue to focus more on characters&#x27; emotions, such as interrupting Han and Leia as they are about to kiss. Kazanjian said many mistakes were made but blamed Weber, Lucasfilm vice president John Moohr, and primarily Kurtz. Actor John Morton called Kurtz an unsung hero, who brought his experience of filming war to &quot;Empire&quot;.

=== Post-production ===
The schedule overrun resulted in filming and post-production taking place simultaneously; filmed footage was shipped immediately to ILM to begin effects work. A rough cut resembling the finished film (minus special effects) was put together by mid-October 1979. Lucas provided 31 pages of notes about changes he wanted, mainly alterations in dialogue and scene lengths. Jones recorded Vader&#x27;s dialogue in late 1979 and early 1980. In early 1980, Lucas changed the long-planned opening of Luke riding his tauntaun to a shot of the Star Destroyer launching probes. He continued tweaking elements to improve the special effects, but even with ILM staff working up to 24 hours a day, six days a week, there was not enough time to do everything they wanted. A Dagobah pick-up scene, in which R2-D2 is spat out by a monster, was filmed in Lucas&#x27;s swimming pool; the Emperor&#x27;s scenes were filmed in February 1980.

Fox executives did not see a cut of the film until March. That month, Lucas decided he wanted an additional Hoth scene and auditioned 50 ILM crew to appear as Rebels. The final 124-minute cut was completed on April 16, which triggered a $10million payment from Fox to Bank of Boston. Lucasfilm also launched an employee bonus scheme to share &quot;Empire&quot;″s profits with its staff. Test screenings were held in San Francisco on April 19. While the tauntaun special effect was criticized, audiences liked Han&#x27;s reply of &quot;I know&quot; to Leia&#x27;s confession of love. Lucas was unimpressed by the scene, believing it was not how Han would act. Because the magnetic soundtrack could flake from the film reels, Kurtz hired people to watch the film reels 24 hours a day to identify defects; 22% were defective.

Shortly after the film&#x27;s theatrical release, Lucas decided the ending was unclear about where Luke and Leia were in relation to Lando and Chewbacca. In the three-week window between its limited and wider release, Lucas, Johnston, and visual effects artist Ken Ralston filmed enhancement scenes at ILM, using existing footage, a new score, modified dialogue, and new miniatures to create establishing shots of the Rebel fleet and their relative positions. By the project&#x27;s conclusion, around 700 people had worked on &quot;Empire&quot;.

== Special effects and design ==

Lucas&#x27;s firm, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, developed the special effects for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; at a cost of $8million, including staffing and the construction of the company&#x27;s new facility in Marin County, California. The building was still under construction when staff arrived in September 1978, and initially lacked the equipment that would be necessary to complete their work. Compared to the 360 special effects shots for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot; required around 600.

The crew, supervised by Richard Edlund and Brian Johnson, included Dennis Muren, Bruce Nicholson, Lorne Peterson, Steve Gawley, Phil Tippett, Tom St. Amand, and Nilo Rodis-Jamero. Up to 100 people worked on the project daily, including Stuart Freeborn, who was responsible mainly for crafting the Yoda puppet. Various techniques, including miniatures, matte paintings, stop motion, articulated models and full-size vehicles were used to create &quot;Empire&quot;″s many effects.

=== Context ===

Industry professionals expected comedies and positive entertainment to dominate theaters in 1980 because of low morale in the United States caused by an economic recession. This generally increased theatrical visits as audiences sought escapism and ignored romantic films and depictions of blue-collar life. A surge of interest in science fiction following &quot;Star Wars&quot; led to many low-budget entries in the genre attempting to profit by association and big-budget entries such as &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; and &quot;The Black Hole&quot;, both released just months before &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Sequels were not expected to perform as well as their originals, and there were low expectations for merchandising. Even so, tie-in deals were arranged with Coca-Cola, Nestlé, General Mills, and Topps collectibles.

Fox was confident in the film and spent little money on advertising, taking out small advertisements in newspapers instead of full-page spreads. The studio&#x27;s market research showed 60% of those interested in the film were male. Lucasfilm set up a telephone number allowing callers to hear a message from cast members. Fox demanded a minimum 28-week appearance in theaters, although 12 weeks was the norm for major films. Estimates suggested &quot;Empire&quot; needed to earn $57.2million to be profitable, after marketing, distribution, and loan interest costs.

=== Credits and title ===
As with &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Lucas wanted to place all of the crew credits at the end of the film to avoid interfering with the opening. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) and Directors Guild of America (DGA) had allowed this for the first film because Lucas directed and it opened with the logo for his namesake Lucasfilm, but for &quot;Empire&quot; they refused to allow Kershner or the first and second unit directors to be credited only at the end, fined Lucas $250,000 when he ignored them and tried to have the film removed from theaters. Because Lucas had followed the laws relevant to the United Kingdom where it was produced, the DGA was unable to sanction him and instead fined Kershner $25,000. Lucas paid his fine but was so frustrated that he left the WGA, DGA, and Motion Picture Association, which restricted his ability to write and direct future films.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; leaked the film&#x27;s title in January 1978; it was officially announced in August. The opening crawl identified the film as &quot;Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, establishing Lucas&#x27;s plan to make a nine-part &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. &quot;Star Wars&quot; was also renamed &quot;Episode IV — A New Hope&quot;. Roger Kastel designed the theatrical poster.

=== Box office ===
A sneak preview of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; took place on May 6, 1980 at the Dominion Theatre in London, followed by another preview screening on May 17 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. This event, which featured the principal cast, was attended by 600 children, including Special Olympians. The film&#x27;s world premiere took place on May 20 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. Dubbed &quot;Empire Day&quot;, the event included actors in Stormtrooper attire interacting with people across the city.

In North America, &quot;Empire&quot; opened mid-week on May 21, leading into the extended Memorial Day holiday weekend. The number of theaters was deliberately limited to 126 to make it difficult to get a ticket, thus generating more appeal—a strategy used with films expected to receive positive word of mouth. The film earned $1.3million during its opening day—an average of $10,581 per theater. It garnered a further $4.9million during the weekend and $1.5million during the Monday holiday, for a total of $6.4million—an average of $50,919 per theater. This made &quot;Empire&quot; the number one film of the weekend, ahead of the counterprogrammed debuts of the comedy &quot;The Gong Show Movie&quot; ($1.5million) and &quot;The Shining&quot; ($600,000). By the end of its first week, the film had earned $9.6million—a 60% increase over &quot;Star Wars&quot;—averaging $76,201 per theater, the highest-ever figure for a film in over 100 theaters.

It remained number one until its fourth weekend, when it fell to third with $3.6million, behind the spoof comedy &quot;Wholly Moses!&quot; ($3.62million) and the Western &quot;Bronco Billy&quot; ($3.7million). It regained the number one position in its fifth weekend, expanding its theater count to 823 and earning $10.8million. Combined with its weekday gross, &quot;Empire&quot; garnered a single-week gross of approximately $20million, a box office record the film would hold until &quot;Superman II&quot;″s $24million the following year. It remained number one for the next seven weeks, before falling to number two in its thirteenth week with $4.3million, behind the debuting &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; ($10.9million). Detailed box office tracking is unavailable for the rest of &quot;Empire&quot;″s 32-week, 1,278-theater total run.

&quot;Empire&quot; earned between $181.4–209.4million in its initial North American release, making it the highest-grossing film of the year, ahead of the comedy films ($103.3million), &quot;Stir Crazy&quot; ($101.3million), and &quot;Airplane!&quot; ($83.5million). Although it earned less than the $221.3million of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot; was considered a financial success. Industry experts estimated the film returned $120million to the filmmakers, which recouped Lucas&#x27;s investment and cleared his debt; he paid out $5million in employee bonuses. Box office figures are unavailable for all the releases outside of North America in 1980, although &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the film performed well in the United Kingdom and Japan. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot; earned approximately $192.1million, giving the film a cumulative worldwide gross of $401.5million, making it the highest-grossing film of the year. &quot;Empire&quot; did not achieve the same success as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which Lucas blamed on its inconclusive ending.

&quot;Empire&quot; has received multiple theatrical re-releases, including in July 1981 ($26.8million), November 1982 ($14.5million), and Special Edition versions (modified by Lucas) in February 1997 ($67.6million). Cumulatively, these releases have raised the North American box office gross to $290.3–$292.4million. It is estimated to have earned a worldwide total of $538.4–$549million. Adjusted for inflation, the North American box office is equivalent to $920.8million, making it the thirteenth-highest-grossing film ever.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; received mixed reviews upon its initial release, a change from the positive reception of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In March 1981, The &quot;Los Angeles&quot; &quot;Times&quot; released a summary of the leading critics’ choices for top 10 films of the year: Robert Redford’s &quot;Ordinary People&quot; appeared on 42 lists, while &quot;Empire&quot; made it onto 24. Fan reactions were decidedly mixed, with many concerned by the film&#x27;s change in tone and surprising narrative revelations, particularly Leia&#x27;s love for Han over Luke and Luke&#x27;s relationship with Vader. Even so, the 536 audience members polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A+&quot; on an A+ to F scale, with males and those under the age of 25 rating it highest.

Some critics believed &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was a good film but not as enjoyable as &quot;Star Wars&quot;. They believed the tonal shift featuring darker material and more mature story lines detracted from the charm, fun, and comic silliness of the original. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s Joy Gould Boyum believed it was &quot;absurd&quot; to add dramatic weight to the lighthearted &quot;Star Wars&quot;, stripping it of its innocence. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Gary Arnold found the darker undercurrents and greater narrative scale interesting because it created more dramatic threads to explore. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s David Denby argued it was more spectacular than the original, but lacked its camp style. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Arthur Knight believed the novelty of the original and the plethora of space opera films produced since made &quot;Empire&quot; seem derivative; even so, he called it the best in the genre since &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Writing for &quot;Time&quot;, Gerald Clarke said &quot;Empire&quot; surpassed &quot;Star Wars&quot; in several ways, including being more visually and artistically interesting. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Vincent Canby called it a more mechanical, less suspenseful experience.

Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Charles Champlin said the inconclusive ending cleverly completed the narrative while serving as a cliffhanger, but Clarke called it a &quot;not very satisfying&quot; conclusion. Canby and the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;″s Dave Kehr believed that as the middle film, it should have focused on narrative development instead of exposition, finding little narrative progression between the film&#x27;s beginning and end. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Judith Martin labeled it a &quot;good junk&quot; film, enjoyable but fleeting, because it lacked a stand-alone narrative. Knight and Clarke found the story sometimes difficult to follow—Knight because the third act jumped between separate storylines, and Clarke because he missed important information in the fast-paced plot. Kehr and &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s Richard Combs wrote that characterization seemed to be less important than special effects, visual spectacle and action set pieces that accomplished little narratively.

Reviews were mixed for the principal cast. Knight wrote that Kershner&#x27;s direction made the characters more human and less archetypal. Hamill, Fisher, and Ford received some praise, with Champlin calling Hamill &quot;youthfully innocent&quot; and engaging, and Fisher independent. Arnold described the character progression as less about development and more about &quot;finesse&quot;, with little change taking place, while Kehr felt the characters were &quot;stiffer&quot; without Lucas&#x27;s direction. Knight called Guinness&#x27;s performance half-hearted, and Janet Maslin criticized Lando Calrissian, the only major black character in the film, as &quot;exaggeratedly unctuous, untrustworthy and loaded with jive&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Gene Siskel said the non-human characters, including the robots and Chewbacca, remained the most lovable creatures, with Yoda being the film&#x27;s highlight. Knight, Gould Boyum, and Arnold thought Yoda to be incredibly lifelike; Arnold considered his expressions so realistic that he believed an actor&#x27;s face had been composited onto the puppet. Canby called the human cast bland and nondescript, and said even the robot characters offered diminishing enjoyment, but Yoda was a success when used sparingly.

Although Arnold praised Kershner&#x27;s direction, others believed that Lucas&#x27;s oversight was obvious and &quot;Empire&quot; lacked Kershner&#x27;s established directorial sensibilities. Denby described his work as &quot;impersonal&quot; and Canby believed it was impossible to identify what Kershner had contributed. Combs believed Kershner was an &quot;ill-advised&quot; director because he emphasized the characters, and the result was common tropes at the expense of the comic-strip pace of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Peter Suschitzky&#x27;s cinematography was praised for its visuals and bold color choices, and the special effects were lauded as &quot;breathtaking&quot;, &quot;ingenious&quot;, and visually dazzling. Jim Harwood said he was let down only by the familiarity of the effects from the original, which were emulated by other films. Champlin appreciated that the effects were used to enhance scenes rather than being the focus.

=== Accolades ===
At the 1981 Academy Awards, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; won the award for Best Sound (Bill Varney, Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker, and Peter Sutton) and a Special Achievement Academy Award for Best Visual Effects (Johnson, Edlund, Muren, and Nicholson). The film received a further two nominations: Best Art Direction (Reynolds, Leslie Dilley, Harry Lange, Alan Tomkins, and Michael Ford) and Best Original Score (John Williams). Williams also won two Grammy Awards: Best Instrumental Composition and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. He earned the film&#x27;s sole Golden Globe Awards nomination, for Best Original Score.

The 34th British Academy Film Awards garnered &quot;Empire&quot; one award for Best Music (Williams), and two additional nominations: Best Sound (Sutton, Varney, and Ben Burtt) and Best Production Design (Reynolds). At the 8th Saturn Awards, &quot;Empire&quot; received four awards: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director (Kershner), Best Actor (Hamill), and Best Special Effects (Johnson and Edlund). The film also won a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture.

== Post-release ==
=== Special Edition and other changes ===
As part of his plan to develop a prequel trilogy of films in the late 1990s, Lucas remastered and rereleased the original trilogy, including &quot;Empire&quot;, under the title &quot;Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition&quot; to test special effects. This included altering scenes or adding new scenes, some of which tied into the prequel films. Lucas described it as bringing the trilogy closer to his original vision with modern technology. Among the alterations were full shots of the wampa and computer-generated locations with added buildings or people. These editions were well received by critics. Roger Ebert called &quot;Empire&quot; the best and &quot;heart&quot; of the original trilogy.

Since their initial release, the Special Editions have been altered multiple times. For the 2004 rerelease, the Clive Revill/Elaine Baker Emperor was replaced by Ian McDiarmid, who had performed the role since &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983). Temuera Morrison, who portrayed Fett&#x27;s clone predecessor in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), dubbed over Wingreen&#x27;s lines. Minor changes were made for the 2011 Blu-ray release, including adding flames to the probe droid&#x27;s impact crater and color modifications. The Special Edition releases were controversial with fans, who considered the changes to the original films unnecessary or too substantial. The unaltered versions have been commercially unavailable since a 2006 DVD release, which used unrestored footage from an early 1990s Laserdisc release. &quot;Harmy&#x27;s Despecialized Edition&quot; is an unofficial fan effort to preserve the unaltered films. The 2010 documentary &quot;The People vs. George Lucas&quot; documents the relationship between the films, their fans, and Lucas.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Empire&quot; was released on VHS (Video Home System), Laserdisc, and CED videodisc formats at Christmas 1984 at a price of $79.95 and became the top-selling tape at that price point at the time with sales of 375,000 units. The VHS and Laserdisc versions received various releases in the following years, often alongside the other original trilogy films in collections, with minor alterations such as widescreen formats or remastered sound. The 1992 Special Collector&#x27;s Edition included the documentary &quot;From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga&quot;. In 1997, the Special Edition of the original trilogy was released on VHS. When the film debuted on television in November 1987, it was preceded by a second-person introduction by Darth Vader, framed as an interruption of the Earth broadcast by the Galactic Empire.

The film was released on DVD in 2004, collected with &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, with additional alterations to each film. The release included the documentary &quot;Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy&quot;, about the making of the original trilogy. Lucas said the modified versions were the way he had wanted them to be, and he had no interest in restoring the original theatrical cuts for release. Public demand eventually led to the release of the 2006 Limited Edition DVD collection that included the original unmodified films transferred from the 1993 Laserdisc Definitive Edition, creating problems with the image display.

&quot;Empire&quot; was released on Blu-ray in 2011, as part of a collection containing the Special Edition original trilogy and a separate version containing the original and prequel trilogies alongside featurettes about the making of the films. In 2015, &quot;Empire&quot; and the other available films were released digitally on various platforms. A 4K resolution version—restored from the 1997 Special Edition print—was released in 2019 on Disney+. In 2020, a 27-disc Skywalker Saga box set was released, which contained all nine films in the series. It featured a Blu-ray version and a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version of each film, as well as special features from the 2011 release.

=== Other media ===

Merchandise for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; includes posters, children&#x27;s books, clothing, character busts and statues, action figures, furnishings, and Lego sets. The novelization of the film, written by Donald F. Glut and released in April 1980, was a success, selling 2–3million copies. A &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic book series, launched in 1977 by Marvel Comics and written by Archie Goodwin and Carmine Infantino, adapted the original trilogy of films; &quot;Empire&quot;″s run began in 1980. The book &quot;The Making of the Empire Strikes Back&quot; (2010) by J. W. Rinzler provides a comprehensive history of the film&#x27;s production, including behind-the-scenes photos and cast interviews.

The film was the first in the series to be adapted for video games, beginning with &quot;Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1982) developed by Parker Brothers for the Atari 2600 games console. This was followed in 1985 by the &quot;Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&quot; arcade game. &quot;Star Wars Trilogy Arcade&quot; (1998) features the Hoth battle as a level. &quot;Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was released in 1992 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy, and &quot;Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&quot; followed in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Scenes from &quot;Empire&quot; have also appeared in games like &quot;Star Wars: Rogue Squadron&quot; (1998) and &quot;Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron&quot; (2007). &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; pinball machine (1980) was the first officially licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; pinball machine. It became a collector&#x27;s item, as only 350 machines were produced exclusively in Australia.

== Thematic analysis ==
=== Mythology and inspirations ===
Critical analysis has suggested various inspirations for &quot;Empire&quot;, particularly the early 1930s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serials that include a cloud city similar to Bespin. Film critic Tim Robey wrote that much of &quot;Empire&quot;″s imagery and narrative can be connected to the 1975 film &quot;Dersu Uzala&quot;, directed by Akira Kurosawa—whose work inspired Lucas. Muren described the Empire&#x27;s assault on Hoth with AT-AT vehicles as an analogy for the Vietnam War, specifically an invading military employing equipment inappropriate for the local terrain.

Clarke identified Luke as the heir to mythological heroes, such as Prometheus, Jason, and Galahad. He is guided initially by a traditional aide, Obi-Wan, who offers the promise of destiny until he is replaced by Yoda. Anne Lancashire wrote that the Yoda narrative is a traditional mythological tale in which the hero is trained by a wise old master and must abandon all his preconceived notions. Clarke described Luke&#x27;s journey as the hero who ventures into the unknown to be tested by his own dark impulses but eventually overcomes them. He believed this represented the human ability to control irrational impulsiveness to serve love, order, and justice.

Lucas wanted Yoda to be a traditional fairy-tale or mythological character, akin to a frog or an unassuming old man, to instill a message about respecting everyone and not judging on appearance alone, because he believed that would lead the hero to succeed. &quot;The New York Observer&quot;″s Brandon Katz described Yoda as deepening the Force through philosophy. Yoda says they are all luminous beings beyond just flesh and matter, and presents the Jedi as Zen warriors who work in harmony with the Force. Kasdan described them as enlightened warrior priests, similar to Samurai.

=== Religion ===
In developing the Force, Lucas said he wanted it to represent the core essence of multiple religions unified by their common traits. Primarily, he designed it with the intent that there is good, evil, and a god. Lucas&#x27;s personal faith includes a belief in God and basic morality, such as treating others fairly and not taking another&#x27;s life. &quot;The Presbyterian Journal&quot; described the film&#x27;s religious message as closer to Eastern religions such as Zoroastrianism or Buddhism than Judeo-Christian, presenting good and evil as abstract concepts. Similarly, God or the Force is an impersonal entity, taking no direct action. &quot;Christianity Today&quot; said that the film&#x27;s drama is caused by the absence of a righteous god or being creating a direct influence.

Lancashire and J. W. Rinzler described Luke&#x27;s journey as based purely on Christianity, focused on destiny and free will, with Luke serving as a Christ-like figure and Vader as a fallen angel attempting to lure him toward evil. Kershner said any religious symbolism was unintentional, as he wanted to focus on the power of an individual&#x27;s untapped potential instead of magic.

=== Duality and evil ===
Anne Lancashire contrasted the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film&#x27;s message of idealism, heroics, and friendship with the more complex tone of &quot;Empire&quot;. The latter challenges the former&#x27;s notions, primarily because Luke loses his innocence in coming to perceive people as neither entirely good nor evil. The scene in which Luke enters the dark side cave on Dagobah represents where his anger will lead him and forces him to move beyond his belief that he is completely on the light side of the Force. Kershner said the cave tests Luke against his greatest fear, but because the fear is in his mind, and he brought his weapon with him, it creates a scenario where he is forced to use it. After defeating the avatar of Vader, the mask splits open to reveal Luke&#x27;s face, suggesting he will succumb to the temptations of the dark side unless he learns patience and to abandon his anger.

The darkness is similarly presented in Han, a self-interested smuggler struggling with his growing feelings for Leia and the responsibility associated with her cause. The film represents his two sides in Leia and Lando, a representative of his smuggler life. &quot;Empire&quot; questions the cost of friendship. Where &quot;Star Wars&quot; presents traditional friendship, &quot;Empire&quot; presents friendship as requiring sacrifice. Han sacrifices himself in the frigid cold of Hoth to save Luke&#x27;s life. Similarly, Luke abandons his Jedi training, something he has longed for, to rescue his friends. This can be seen as a selfish choice, as he does so against Yoda and Obi-Wan&#x27;s instructions, potentially sacrificing himself for his friends instead of training to defeat the Empire, a cause his friends support. According to Lancashire, characters are shown to be heroic through sacrificing for others instead of fighting battles.

Lancashire believed that Luke&#x27;s impatience to leave for Bespin exemplifies his lack of growth from his training. There, Vader tempts him with the power of the dark side and the revelation that he is Luke&#x27;s father. Vader wants Luke&#x27;s help to destroy the Emperor, not for good, but so that Vader can impose his own order over the galaxy. This admission robs Luke of the idealized image of his Jedi father, reveals Obi-Wan&#x27;s deception in hiding his parentage, and takes the last of his innocence. Gerald Clarke suggests Luke is not strong or virtuous enough to resist Vader during this confrontation, and so allows himself to fall into the airshaft below, showing the antagonist does sometimes win. The concept of a character having a good father and an evil father is a common story trope because of its simple representations of good and evil. At the film&#x27;s finale, Luke has a greater understanding of the relationship between good and evil, and the dual nature of people.

== Legacy ==
=== Critical reassessment ===
&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; remains an enduringly popular piece of cinema. It is considered groundbreaking for its cliffhanger ending, influence on mainstream films, and special effects. Brian Lowry of CNN wrote that without the &quot;groundwork laid by one of the best sequels ever, [the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise] wouldn&#x27;t be the force that it is now&quot;.

Despite the film&#x27;s initial mixed reception, it has since been reevaluated by critics and fans and is now often considered the best film in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, and one of the greatest films ever made. In 2014, members of the entertainment industry ranked &quot;Empire&quot; as the 32nd-best film of all time in a poll conducted by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; (&quot;Star Wars&quot; was #11). &quot;Empire&quot; magazine named it the third-best film of all time, stating that the modern cliché of sequels employing a darker tone can be traced back to &quot;Empire&quot;. A 1997 retrospective review by Roger Ebert declared the film the best of the original trilogy, praising the depth of its storytelling and its ability to create a sense of wonder in the audience. A vote by 250,000 &quot;Business Insider&quot; readers in 2014 listed it as the greatest film ever made; it is also included in the 2013 film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;. The revelation that Vader is Luke&#x27;s father continues to be seen as one of the greatest plot twists in cinema. Similarly, Han saying &quot;I know&quot; in response to Leia&#x27;s love confession is considered one of the most iconic scenes in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and one of the more famous lines of improvised dialogue in cinema.

&quot;Empire&quot; magazine selected the film as the sixth greatest movie sequel, lauding the &quot;bold&quot; unresolved ending and willingness to avoid the same formula as the first film. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; called it the second-best sequel—after &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986)—and hailed it as Lucas&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot;. &quot;Playboy&quot; named it the third-best sequel, describing the disclosure of the relationship between Luke and Vader as the &quot;emotional core that has elevated &quot;Star Wars&quot; to the pantheon of timeless modern sagas&quot;. The BBC and &quot;Collider&quot; listed it as one of the best sequels ever made, while &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot; described it as a sequel that surpasses the original. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes recognizes it as the 27th-best sequel, based on review scores. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2014 reader-voted list of the best sequels listed &quot;Empire&quot; at third.

 &quot;Empire&quot; has a score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic based on the reviews of 25 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Characters introduced in the film, such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian, are now considered iconic. The American Film Institute ranked Darth Vader as the third best villain on its 2003 list of the 100 Best Heroes &amp; Villains, after Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter.

=== Cultural influence===

&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was ubiquitous in American culture upon its release. Freddie Mercury ended a 1980 Queen concert by riding on the shoulders of someone dressed as Darth Vader. The film was referenced in political cartoons. Kershner received letters from fans around the world asking for autographs, and from psychologists who had used Yoda to explain philosophical ideas to their patients. Other films, television shows, and video games have extensively referenced or parodied the film, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. In 2010, the United States Library of Congress selected &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Landon Palmer, Eric Diaz, and Darren Mooney argue that &quot;Empire&quot;, and not &quot;Star Wars&quot;, created the concept of the modern blockbuster film franchise, which includes sequels serving as chapters in an infinitely expanding narrative—a template which was embraced by other film properties in the decades following &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s release. This new paradigm stood in opposition to the popular trend of exploiting a successful film by creating low-budget sequels (which resulted in diminishing returns, as happened with the &quot;Jaws&quot; franchise). Instead, more money was spent on &quot;Empire&quot; to expand the fictional universe and reap greater box-office returns. The use of a cliffhanger ending to set up a future sequel is seen in many modern films, particularly those in the MCU. It has also been suggested that &quot;Empire&quot; forged a narrative structure that continues to be emulated in trilogies, wherein the middle film is darker than the original and features an ending in which the protagonists fail to defeat the antagonists (which sets up a subsequent film). Emmet Asher-Perrin and Ben Sherlock cite the series &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; as examples.

Filmmakers such as the Russo brothers, Roland Emmerich, and Kevin Feige, and actors such as Neil Patrick Harris, Jim Carrey, and Jude Law, cite &quot;Empire&quot; as an inspiration in their careers or identify as fans.

== Sequels, prequels, and adaptations ==

&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was adapted into a 1982 radio play broadcast on National Public Radio in the United States. &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was released in 1983, concluding the original film trilogy. &quot;Jedi&quot;″s plot follows the Rebel assault on the Empire and Luke&#x27;s final confrontation with Vader and the Emperor. Like the previous films, &quot;Jedi&quot; was a financial success and fared well with critics.

Nearly two decades after the release of &quot;Empire&quot;, Lucas wrote and directed the prequel trilogy, consisting of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005). The films chronicle the history between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and the latter&#x27;s fall to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader. The storylines and certain new characters in the prequel films polarized critics and fans. After Lucas sold the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise to the Walt Disney Company in 2012, Disney developed a sequel trilogy, consisting of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019). Original trilogy cast members—including Ford, Hamill, and Fisher—reprised their roles, and were joined by new characters portrayed by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac. Standalone films and television series have also been released, with narratives relating to the story arcs of the original trilogy.

<text>Marcus Cook Connelly (December 13, 1890 – December 21, 1980) was an American playwright, director, producer, performer, and lyricist. He was a key member of the Algonquin Round Table, and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1930.

==Biography==
Marcus Cook Connelly was born to actor and hotelier Patrick Joseph Connelly and actress Mabel Fowler Cook in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. His father died in 1902. Connelly attended Trinity Hall boarding school in Washington, Pennsylvania, after which he began collecting money for ads in &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; to help to support his mother. 

His initial newspaper job led to Connelly&#x27;s working as an Associated Press cub reporter, after which he became a junior reporter for &quot;The Pittsburgh Gazette Times&quot;. Eventually he began writing a humor column for that newspaper. In 1919 he joined the Algonquin Round Table. 

While he was working in Pittsburgh, Connelly ventured into writing for the stage, creating skits for shows put on by an athletic association and one-act plays for a little theater group. His interest in the theater increased after he began reporting on the theater beat for &quot;The Morning Telegraph&quot; in New York City. In that role he developed a friendship with George S. Kaufman, who wrote about drama for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Connelly had contributed to several Broadway musicals before teaming up with his most important collaborator, Kaufman, in 1921. During their four-year partnership, they wrote five comedies – &quot;Dulcy&quot; (1921), &quot;To the Ladies&quot; (1922), &quot;Merton of the Movies&quot; (1922), &quot;The Deep Tangled Wildwood&quot; (1923) and &quot;Beggar on Horseback&quot; (1924) – and also co-directed and contributed sketches to the 1922 revue &quot;The &#x27;49ers&quot;, collaborated on the book to the musical comedy &quot;Helen of Troy, New York&quot; (1923), and wrote both the book and lyrics for another musical comedy, &quot;Be Yourself&quot; (1924). 

Connelly received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for &quot;The Green Pastures&quot; in 1930. The play, a re-telling of episodes from the Old Testament, was staged with the first all-black Broadway cast. He contributed verse and articles to &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s&quot;, and other magazines.

Connelly was a drama teacher at Yale University from 1946 to 1950. In 1968, Connelly published his memoirs, &quot;Voices Offstage&quot;. Over the years, Connelly appeared as an actor in 21 movies, including &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; (1957) with James Stewart.

Connelly&#x27;s television debut as an actor came in 1953 in an episode of &quot;Broadway TV Theatre&quot; on WOR-TV. A review in the trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; said that Connelly &quot;handled himself with winning aplomb&quot;.

A film about the Round Table members, &quot;The Ten-Year Lunch&quot; (1987), won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and featured Connelly, who was the last survivor. The 1994 film &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot;, a fictional account of the group, featured actor Matt Malloy as Connelly.

Connelly died on December 21, 1980, in St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Manhattan, aged 90.

<text>Otto Abels Harbach, born Otto Abels Hauerbach (August 18, 1873 – January 24, 1963) was an American lyricist and librettist of nearly 50 musical comedies and operettas. Harbach collaborated as lyricist or librettist with many of the leading Broadway composers of the early 20th century, including Jerome Kern, Louis Hirsch, Herbert Stothart, Vincent Youmans, George Gershwin, and Sigmund Romberg. Harbach believed that music, lyrics, and story should be closely connected, and, as Oscar Hammerstein II&#x27;s mentor, he encouraged Hammerstein to write musicals in this manner. Harbach is considered one of the first great Broadway lyricists, and he helped raise the status of the lyricist in an age more concerned with music, spectacle, and stars. Some of his more famous lyrics are &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Indian Love Call&quot; and &quot;Cuddle up a Little Closer, Lovey Mine&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Otto Abels Hauerbach was born on August 18, 1873, in Salt Lake City, Utah to Danish immigrant parents. His family&#x27;s original surname was Christiansen, but shortly after settling in the United States near Salt Lake City in the 1830s, they took the name of the farm on which they worked, Hauerbach, as their new surname.

He attended the Salt Lake Collegiate Institute, transferring to Knox College, in Galesburg, Illinois, where he was a friend of Carl Sandburg, joined Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and graduated in 1895. Knox has since named its 599-seat Harbach Theatre in his honor. He then taught English and public speaking at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, with the goal of becoming an English professor. In the early 1900s, complaining of eye difficulties making prolonged reading uncomfortable, he became a newspaper reporter. He also worked at various advertising agencies, at an insurance firm, as a copywriter in advertising, and later as a journalist. He would have to pull out of Columbia when he could not financially support himself.

===Early career (1902–1911)===
In 1902, he spotted an advertisement for a new Joe Weber and Lew Fields musical with a picture of star Fay Templeton. He had not been interested in theatre but more in literary classics, but after seeing the show, realized he liked the lighthearted genre.

That same year, he met composer Karl Hoschna. They wrote a comic opera together, &quot;The Daughter of the Desert&quot;, but no producer was interested in producing the work. Harbach and Hoschna continued to collaborate, writing songs to be interpolated into other Broadway shows. They received their first chance to have a complete show produced on Broadway when Isidore Witmark asked Hoschna, his employee, to serve as composer for a musical version of Mary McIntire Pacheco&#x27;s play &quot;Incog&quot;. Hoschna asked Harbach to write the lyrics. With Witmark and Charles Dickson writing the libretto, the resulting show was &quot;Three Twins&quot;, which opened in 1908 and ran for 288 performances (Harbach was paid a hundred dollars for his work). The show starred Clifton Crawford. One of Hoschna and Harbach&#x27;s songs for &quot;Three Twins&quot;, &quot;Cuddle Up A Little Closer, Lovey Mine,&quot; became a popular hit.

Their next collaboration was &quot;Madame Sherry&quot; in 1910, an adaptation of a 1902 German operetta, which featured Jack Gardner in the lead role. Their score included the standard &quot;Every Little Movement (Has a Meaning All Its Own)&quot;. Harbach and Hoschna&#x27;s score was augmented with interpolations, including the popular hit &quot;Put Your Arms Around Me, Honey&quot; by Albert von Tilzer and Junie McCree. They would collaborate for four more shows until Hoschna died in 1911, aged 35.

===Career (1912–1936)===
Harbach&#x27;s work with Hoschna had established his reputation as a competent Broadway lyricist and librettist. Producer Arthur Hammerstein asked Harbach in 1912 to serve as librettist for a new operetta called &quot;The Firefly&quot;, to be composed by Rudolf Friml. Harbach set his libretto in contemporary Manhattan and Bermuda, which differed from the typical European setting for operettas. The result was a huge success, with hits such as &quot;Sympathy&quot;, &quot;Giannina Mia&quot;, and &quot;Love is Like a Firefly&quot;.

The success of &quot;The Firefly&quot; led to ten more musical collaborations for librettist Harbach, composer Friml, and producer Arthur Hammerstein, including &quot;High Jinks&quot; (1913) and &quot;Katinka&quot; (1915). Most of the shows Harbach and Friml wrote ran for over 200 performances each, which was a successful run for the time period.

Harbach also worked on projects with other collaborators during this time. In 1914, he contributed the libretto only to the Percy Wenrich musical &quot;The Crinoline Girl&quot;. He collaborated with composer Louis Hirsch and scored his biggest success thus far in his career in 1917 with &quot;Going Up&quot;. This was his first attempt at a musical comedy, as opposed to an American operetta. The show was based on the 1910 comedy &quot;The Aviator&quot; by James Montgomery, who co-wrote the libretto with Harbach. The show ran for 351 performances, toured nationally, and was an even larger hit in London. Also in 1917, he shortened his name from Hauerbach to Harbach to avoid anti-German sentiment caused by World War I. Harbach and Hirsch collaborated on another notable Broadway production in 1920, &quot;Mary&quot;.

Also around 1920, producer Arthur Hammerstein introduced his nephew Oscar Hammerstein II to Harbach. Oscar was an aspiring lyricist and book writer, and Harbach became his mentor. Harbach encouraged Oscar to treat writing for the musical theatre as a &quot;serious art form.&quot; Together, they wrote book and lyrics for &quot;Tickle Me&quot; (1920), &quot;Jimmie&quot; (1920), &quot;Wildflower&quot; (1923), &quot;Rose-Marie&quot; (1924), &quot;Sunny&quot; (1925), &quot;Song of the Flame&quot; (1925), &quot;The Wild Rose&quot; (1926), &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1926), &quot;Golden Dawn&quot; (1927), and &quot;Good Boy&quot; (1928).

Harbach and Hammerstein&#x27;s operetta collaboration, &quot;Wildflower&quot; (1923), was Harbach&#x27;s first work with composer Vincent Youmans. Harbach would then collaborate with composer Youmans, co-lyricist Irving Caesar, and co-librettist Frank Mandel on the 1925 hit musical comedy &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;.

Harbach first collaborated with Broadway composer Jerome Kern on &quot;Sunny&quot; (1925), and they would continue to work together on subsequent musicals, including &quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1926), &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle (1931)&quot;, and &quot;Roberta&quot; (1933). Broadway historian Thomas S. Hischak states that Harbach&#x27;s lyrics for Kern were the finest of his career. &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot; was especially notable, as Harbach (writing both book and lyrics) and Kern aimed to create a modern operetta set in contemporary Brussels &quot;in which music and story were indispensable to each other.&quot; Hits from &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot; included &quot;Try to Forget,&quot; &quot;She Didn&#x27;t Say Yes&quot;, &quot;The Breeze Kissed Your Hair&quot;, and &quot;The Night Was Made for Love&quot;. &quot;Roberta&quot; included the hits &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Yesterdays&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Devastating&quot;, and &quot;The Touch of Your Hand&quot;.
By the mid-1930s, Harbach&#x27;s operetta-influenced style was no longer current on Broadway. His final major production was a collaboration with operetta composer Sigmund Romberg, &quot;Forbidden Melody&quot; (1936).

In addition to his musical collaborations, Harbach also wrote non-musical farce plays for the Broadway stage, including &quot;Up in Mabel&#x27;s Room&quot;.

==Impact and legacy==
Harbach was one of the most prolific Broadway lyricist/librettists of the early 20th century. He collaborated as lyricist or librettist with many of the leading Broadway writers and composers of that era, including Oscar Hammerstein II, Jerome Kern, Louis Hirsch, Herbert Stothart, Vincent Youmans, George Gershwin, and Sigmund Romberg. He became a charter member of ASCAP in 1914, and he served as a director (1920–1963), vice president (1936–1940), and president (1950–1953).
Harbach was also an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Harbach died at his home in New York City on January 24, 1963, aged 89.

==Personal life==
In 1918, Harbach married Eloise Smith Dougall of Salt Lake City, Utah. The Harbachs had two sons, William O. Harbach (a television producer) and Robert Harbach (a writer).

<doc id="53971" wikidata="Q72305" url="?curid=53971" title="Manchego">
<text>Manchego (, ) is a cheese made in the La Mancha region of Spain from the milk of sheep of the Manchega breed. It is aged between 60 days and 2 years.

Manchego has a firm and compact consistency and a buttery texture, often containing small, unevenly distributed air pockets. The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige. The cheese has a distinctive flavour, well developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy, and leaves an aftertaste that is characteristic of sheep&#x27;s milk.

The designation is protected under Spain&#x27;s denominación de origen regulatory classification system, and the cheese has been granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the European Union.

==PDO requirements==
A must satisfy these requirements:
* It must be produced within designated parts of the provinces of Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, and Toledo, all in the La Mancha region.
* It can be made only with the whole milk of sheep of the Manchega breed raised on registered farms within that area.
* It must be aged for a minimum of 60 days (30 days for cheeses weighing up to ) and a maximum of two years.
* It must be produced by pressing in a cylindrical mould that has a maximum height of and a maximum diameter of .

Manchego cheese can be made from pasteurised or raw milk; if the latter, it may be labelled (artisan). The only permitted additives are natural rennet or another approved coagulating enzyme and salt.

==Manufacture and labelling==

The moulds in which the cheese is pressed are barrel-shaped. Traditionally, manchego cheese was made by pressing the curd in plaited esparto grass baskets, which left a distinctive zig-zag pattern (known as ) on the rind. Today, the same effect is achieved by the mould, the inside of which has a design in relief that imparts to the finished cheese an embossed pattern similar to that of woven esparto grass. The top and bottom surfaces of the cheese are impressed with a design of a head of wheat.

During the maturation process, manchego cheese develops a natural rind. The regulations permit this to be washed, coated in paraffin, dipped in olive oil, or treated with certain approved transparent substances, but require that it must not be removed if the cheese is to be marketed as PDO.

Cheeses that meet the PDO requirements carry a casein tab that is applied when the cheese is in the mould and bear a distinctive label that is issued by the Manchego Cheese Denomination of Origin Regulating Council; this carries the legend , a serial number, and artwork depicting Don Quixote de La Mancha.

A cheese that is similar to manchego and made in the same region, but from a blend of cows’, goats’, and ewes’ milk, is sold as , or cheese.

Almost 60% of Spanish cheese with Denomination of Origin is Manchego, which makes it the main reference of Spanish cheese. As most of its production is exported, it is one of the most important ambassadors of Spain’s national gastronomy. La Mancha exported 5.9 million kg of this cheese in 2017, according to the Foundation for Manchego Cheese (Fundación C.R.D.O Queso Manchego).

==Varieties==
 has a variety of different flavours depending on its age:

* : &quot;fresh&quot; cheese is aged for 2 weeks. It has a rich but mild flavour, not a true due to its lack of ageing. Produced in small quantities, it is rarely found outside Spain.
* : semifirm, semicured cheese aged for 3 weeks to 3–4 months, somewhat milder than curado.
* : semifirm cured cheese aged for 3–6 months with a caramel and nutty flavour.
* : aged for 1–2 years, firm with a sharper flavour the longer it is aged; it has a rich, deep pepperiness to it. It grates well, but can also be eaten on its own or on &quot;tapas&quot;.

==Americas==

===North America===
In Mexico and Spanish-speaking areas of the United States, or (manchego-type cheese) is the name given to an industrialized cow&#x27;s milk cheese similar in taste to Monterey Jack. It melts well and is used as both a table cheese and for cooking. Apart from the name, this cheese has nothing in common with the Spanish variety.

===Central America===
In Costa Rica, three companies (Dos Pinos, Los Alpes, and Monteverde) produce a manchego-type cheese (), which can come with a drawing of Don Quijote on the labels. One company also makes a manchego-type cheese with basil added. These Costa Rican cheeses can come dipped in paraffin wax, and some have the pattern pressed on the side.

<text>Lorenz Milton Hart (May 2, 1895 – November 22, 1943) was an American lyricist and half of the Broadway songwriting team Rodgers and Hart. Some of his more famous lyrics include &quot;Blue Moon&quot;; &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot;; &quot;Manhattan&quot;; &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot;; and &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;.

==Life and career==
Hart was born in Harlem, New York City, the elder of two sons, to Jewish immigrant parents, Max M. and Frieda (Isenberg) Hart, of German background. Through his mother, he was a great-grandnephew of the German poet Heinrich Heine. His father, a business promoter, sent Hart and his brother to private schools. (His brother, Teddy Hart, also went into theatre and became a musical comedy star. Teddy Hart&#x27;s wife, Dorothy Hart, wrote a biography of Lorenz Hart.)

Hart received his early education from Columbia Grammar School and entered Columbia College in 1913, before switching to Columbia University School of Journalism, where he attended for two years. In 1919 a friend introduced him to Richard Rodgers, and the two joined forces to write songs for a series of amateur and student productions.

By 1918, Hart was working for the Shubert brothers, partners in theatre, translating German plays songs into English. In 1919, his and Rodgers&#x27; song &quot;Any Old Place With You&quot; was included in the Broadway musical comedy &quot;A Lonely Romeo&quot;. In 1920, six of their songs were used in the musical comedy &quot;Poor Little Ritz Girl&quot;, which also had music by Sigmund Romberg. They were hired to write the score for the 1925 Theatre Guild production &quot;The Garrick Gaieties&quot;, the success of which brought them acclaim.

Rodgers and Hart subsequently wrote the music and lyrics for 26 Broadway musicals during a partnership of more than 20 years that ended shortly before Hart&#x27;s early death. Their &quot;big four&quot; were &quot;Babes in Arms,&quot; &quot;The Boys From Syracuse&quot;, &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, and &quot;On Your Toes.&quot; The Rodgers and Hart songs have been described as intimate and destined for long lives outside the theater. Many of their songs are standard repertoire for singers and jazz instrumentalists. Hart has been called &quot;the expressive bard of the urban generation which matured during the interwar years&quot;. But the &quot;encomiums suggest[ing] that Larry Hart was a poet&quot; caused his friend and fellow writer Henry Myers to state otherwise. &quot;Larry in particular was primarily a showman. If you can manage to examine his songs technically, and for the moment elude their spell, you will see that they are all meant to be acted, that they are part of a play. Larry was a playwright.&quot;

Rodgers and Hart wrote music and lyrics for several films, including &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot; (1932), &quot;The Phantom President&quot; (1932), &quot;Hallelujah, I&#x27;m a Bum&quot; (1933), and &quot;Mississippi&quot; (1935). With their successes, during the Great Depression Hart was earning $60,000 annually, and he became a magnet for many people. He gave numerous large parties. Beginning in 1938, he traveled more often and suffered from his ongoing drinking. Nevertheless, Rodgers and Hart continued working together through mid-1942, with their final new musical being 1942&#x27;s &quot;By Jupiter&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on July 23, 1942: &quot;The Theatre Guild announced yesterday that Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II will soon begin work on a musical version of Lynn Riggs&#x27;s folk-play, &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;, which the Guild produced for sixty-four performances at the Guild Theatre in 1931.&quot; Rodgers had brought Hammerstein onto the project due to Hart&#x27;s worsening mental state; Hart would admit he had difficulty writing a musical for such a rural setting as Oklahoma and departed, leaving an eager Hammerstein (whose own songwriting partner Jerome Kern had no interest in the project) to complete what would eventually become &quot;Oklahoma!.&quot; Rodgers and Hammerstein would continue collaborating for 16 years (ending in Hammerstein&#x27;s death in 1960), a partnership that made the duo one of the most successful composing teams of the 20th century.

Hart, meanwhile, was much affected by his mother&#x27;s death in late April 1943. Regrouping somewhat, Rodgers and Hart teamed a final time in the fall of 1943 for a revival of &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot;. Six new numbers, including &quot;To Keep My Love Alive&quot;, were written for this reworked version of the play; it would prove to be Hart&#x27;s last lyric. Hart had taken off the night of the mid-November opening and was gone for two days. He was found ill in a hotel room from drink and taken to Doctors Hospital, Upper East Side, but died within a few days.

==Lyrical style==
According to Thomas Hischak, Hart &quot;had a remarkable talent for polysyllabic and internal rhymes&quot;, and his lyrics have often been praised for their wit and technical sophistication.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Stephen Holden, &quot;Many of Hart&#x27;s ballad lyrics conveyed a heart-stopping sadness that reflected his conviction that he was physically too unattractive to be lovable.&quot; Holden also noted that &quot;In his lyrics, as in his life, Hart stands as a compellingly lonely figure. Although he wrote dozens of songs that are playful, funny and filled with clever wordplay, it is the rueful vulnerability beneath their surface that lends them a singular poignancy.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Hart lived with his widowed mother Frieda. He was an alcoholic, and would sometimes disappear for weeks at a time on drinking binges.

Hart experienced depression and sadness throughout his life. His erratic behavior was often the cause of friction between him and Rodgers and led to Rodgers teaming with lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II in 1942. On March 31, 1943, Hart attended the Broadway premiere of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. Then Hart attended the opening night party where he told Rodgers, &quot;This is one of the greatest shows I&#x27;ve ever seen, and it&#x27;ll be playing twenty years from now!&quot;

In April 1943, Hart was devastated by the loss of his mother and did not recover emotionally.

Many of Hart&#x27;s contemporaries who knew him socially have stated he was a discreet homosexual, with a reputation as a voyeur, though his friends did not go into detail about people whose behavior he watched, such as their genders.

Robert Gottlieb wrote in the April 2013 edition of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine, There were rumors about Larry [Lorenz Hart] while he was alive, but nothing about his sexuality ever appeared in print. One night in Los Angeles, in 1933, someone from a Hollywood trade magazine approached Dick [Richard Rodgers] at a party and said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to ask you something about Larry ... Is it true Larry&#x27;s a fairy?&quot; Dick grabbed him by the collar, [biographer Gary] Marmorstein recounts, and said, &quot;I never heard that. And if you print it, I&#x27;ll kill you.&quot;

Though Richard Rodgers became celebrated for his music for &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1943, later that year he decided that he and Hart should reunite and create a revival of &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot;, their successful musical from 1927. Hart composed new lyrics for many of the songs in anticipation of the revival&#x27;s November 17, 1943, premiere at the Martin Beck Theatre.

On the November 17 opening night, Hart showed up drunk in the audience at the Martin Beck Theatre. His condition was noticed by his sister-in-law. She persuaded him to accompany her to the Manhattan home of herself and his brother Teddy. Sometime after they arrived at the couple&#x27;s home, Hart left, venturing into cold weather to resume drinking. A friend of Hart&#x27;s found him seated in the gutter of a bar on Manhattan&#x27;s Eighth Avenue that he favored. Hart was shivering, and his friend accompanied him to a hospital.

At the Manhattan hospital, it was determined that Hart had developed pneumonia from exposure. On November 22, 1943, approximately four days after admission to the hospital, Hart died.

Lorenz Hart is buried in Mount Zion Cemetery in Queens County, New York.

==In popular culture==
The circumstances of Lorenz Hart&#x27;s life were heavily altered and romanticized in the 1948 MGM biopic &quot;Words and Music&quot;, with fictitious personal details such as changing his sexual orientation and attributing his erratic behavior and depression to an obsession with a woman (played in the film by Betty Garrett) who turns down his marriage proposal.

In 2024, the film &quot;Blue Moon&quot; was announced to be in production. It is said to be about &quot;the final days of Lorenz Hart, half of the songwriting team Rodgers &amp; Hart and set around Sardi’s Restaurant on March 31, 1943, on the opening night of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;.&quot; Written by Robert Kaplow, the film is directed by Richard Linklater and star Ethan Hawke as Hart, alongside Margaret Qualley, Bobby Cannavale, and Andrew Scott. The film had its world premiere at the main competition of the 75th Berlin International Film Festival, on 18 February 2025, where it won the Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance for Andrew Scott.

<text>Mary Rodgers (January 11, 1931 – June 26, 2014) was an American composer, screenwriter, and author. She wrote the novel &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, which served as the basis of a 1976 film starring Jodie Foster, for which she wrote the screenplay, as well as three other versions. Her best-known musicals were &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot; and &quot;The Mad Show&quot;, and she contributed songs to Marlo Thomas&#x27; successful children&#x27;s album &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot;.

==Early life==
Rodgers was born in New York City. She was a daughter of composer Richard Rodgers and his wife, Dorothy Belle (née Feiner). She had a sister, Mrs. Linda Emory. She attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, and majored in music at Wellesley College.

She began writing music at the age of 16 and her professional career began with writing songs for Little Golden Records, which were albums for children with three-minute songs. One of these recordings, &quot;Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves&quot;, which was released in 1957, featured performances by Bing Crosby of songs Mary Rodgers wrote with lyricist Sammy Cahn. She also composed music for television, including the jingle for the Prince Spaghetti commercial.

==Career==
Her first full-length musical, &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;, which was also her first collaboration with lyricist Marshall Barer (with whom she continued to write songs for nearly a decade), opened Off Broadway in May 1959 and moved to Broadway later in the year. Following the show&#x27;s initial run of 244 performances, there were a US tour (in 1960), a production in London&#x27;s West End (also 1960), three televised productions (in 1964, 1972, and 2005), and a Broadway revival (1996). Cast albums were released for the original Broadway production, the original London production, and the Broadway revival. To this day, the show is frequently performed by community and school groups across the United States.

Another significant compositional project for her was &quot;The Mad Show,&quot; a musical revue based on &quot;Mad&quot; magazine which opened Off Broadway in January 1966 and ran for a total of 871 performances. An original cast album, produced by Goddard Lieberson, was released on Columbia Masterworks. Although the show also began as a collaboration with Marshall Barer, he quit before the project was completed and the show&#x27;s remaining songs feature lyrics by Larry Siegel (co-author of the show&#x27;s book), Steven Vinaver, and Stephen Sondheim, who contributed the lyrics to a parody of &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; called &quot;The Boy From...&quot; under the pseudonym Esteban Ria Nido.

None of her other shows had the same level of success, but she also wrote music for musicals and revues, the first on Broadway being &quot;Davy Jones&#x27; Locker&quot; with Bil Baird&#x27;s marionettes, which had a two-week run at the Morosco Theatre from March 28 to April 11, 1959. (She also wrote the lyrics.) Others included &quot;From A to Z&quot; (1960), &quot;Hot Spot&quot; (1963), &quot;Working&quot; (1978), and Phyllis Newman&#x27;s one-woman show &quot;The Madwoman of Central Park West&quot; (1979). A revue of Rodgers&#x27;s music titled &quot;Hey, Love&quot;, conceived and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. ran in June 1993 at Eighty-Eight&#x27;s in New York City.

She eventually transitioned into writing children&#x27;s books, most notably &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (1972), which was made into a feature film (released 1976) for which Rodgers wrote the screenplay, and was remade for television in 1995, and again for cinemas in 2003. Rodgers&#x27; other children&#x27;s books include &quot;The Rotten Book&quot; (1969), &quot;A Billion for Boris&quot; (1974, later republished under the title &quot;ESP TV&quot;), and &quot;Summer Switch&quot; (1982), and she contributed songs to the landmark children&#x27;s album &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot;. She made a few brief forays back into writing for musical theater, including an adaptation of her book &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (featuring music and lyrics by John Forster), which was presented by Theatreworks/USA in 1991, and &quot;The Griffin and the Minor Canon&quot;, which was produced by Music Theatre Group, but after the latter show she never composed another note of music and never even played the piano again. She later explained, &quot;I had a pleasant talent but not an incredible talent ... I was not my father or my son. And you have to abandon all kinds of things.&quot;

In 2022, 8 years after her passing, Rodgers&#x27; memoir&#x27;s were published in &quot;Shy: The Alarmingly Outspoken Memoirs of Mary Rodgers&quot;, Co-Authored by Jesse Green. 

==Personal life==
Her first husband, whom she married in December 1951, was lawyer Julian B. Beaty, Jr.; they had three children. This marriage ended in 1957. She and her second husband, film executive Henry Guettel, had three sons, including Adam, a Tony Award-winning musical theater composer. Henry died in October 2013 at the age of 85.

Mary Rodgers was a director of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization and a board member of ASCAP. She also served for several years as chairman of the Juilliard School.

She died from heart failure at her home in Manhattan on June 26, 2014.

<doc id="53974" wikidata="Q44342" url="?curid=53974" title="Legend">
<text>A legend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring human actions, believed or perceived to have taken place in human history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time to keep them fresh and vital.

Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. Legends are sometimes distinguished from myths in that they concern human beings as the main characters and do not necessarily have supernatural origins, and sometimes in that they have some sort of historical basis whereas myths generally do not. The Brothers Grimm defined &quot;legend&quot; as &quot;folktale historically grounded&quot;. A by-product of the &quot;concern with human beings&quot; is the long list of legendary creatures, leaving no &quot;resolute doubt&quot; that legends are &quot;historically grounded.&quot;

A modern folklorist&#x27;s professional definition of &quot;legend&quot; was proposed by Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:

Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly ecotypified historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition it belongs.

==Etymology and origin==
&quot;Legend&quot; is a loanword from Old French that entered English usage . The Old French noun &quot;legende&quot; derives from the Medieval Latin &quot;legenda&quot;. In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a narrative of an event. The word &quot;legendary&quot; was originally a noun (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of legends. This word changed to &quot;legendry&quot;, and &quot;legendary&quot; became the adjectival form.

By 1613, English-speaking Protestants began to use the word when they wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any saint not acknowledged in John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot;) was fictitious. Thus, &quot;legend&quot; gained its modern connotations of &quot;undocumented&quot; and &quot;&quot;, which distinguish it from the meaning of &quot;chronicle&quot;.

In 1866, Jacob Grimm described the fairy tale as &quot;poetic, legend historic.&quot; Early scholars such as Friedrich Ranke and Will Erich Peuckert followed Grimm&#x27;s example in focussing solely on the literary narrative, an approach that was enriched particularly after the 1960s, by addressing questions of performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided in considering legends&#x27; social context. Questions of categorising legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on the line of the Aarne–Thompson folktale index, provoked a search for a broader new synthesis.
In an early attempt at defining some basic questions operative in examining folk tales, in 1925 characterised the folk legend as &quot;a popular narrative with an objectively untrue imaginary content&quot;, a dismissive position that was subsequently largely abandoned.

Compared to the highly structured folktale, legend is comparatively amorphous, Helmut de Boor noted in 1928. The narrative content of legend is in realistic mode, rather than the wry irony of folktale; Wilhelm Heiske remarked on the similarity of motifs in legend and folktale and concluded that, in spite of its realistic mode, legend is not more historical than folktale.

In &quot;Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft&quot; (1928), Ernst Bernheim asserted that a legend is simply a longstanding rumour. Gordon Allport credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise; thus &quot;Urban legends&quot; are a feature of rumour. When Willian Hugh Jansen suggested that legends that disappear quickly were &quot;short-term legends&quot; and the persistent ones be termed &quot;long-term legends&quot;, the distinction between legend and rumour was effectively obliterated, Tangherlini concluded.

==Christian &quot;legenda&quot;==
In a narrow Christian sense, &quot;legenda&quot; (&quot;things to be read [on a certain day, in church]&quot;) were hagiographical accounts, often collected in a legendary. Because saints&#x27; lives are often included in many miracle stories, &quot;legend&quot;, in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context, but that contains supernatural, divine or fantastic elements.

==Oral tradition==
History preserved orally through many generations often takes on a more narrative-based or mythological form over time, an example being the oral traditions of the African Great Lakes. 

==Related concepts==

Hippolyte Delehaye distinguished legend from myth: &quot;The &quot;legend&quot;, on the other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot.&quot;

From the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary qualities begin to fade and recede: in &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, Washington Irving transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a literary anecdote with &quot;Gothic&quot; overtones, which actually tended to diminish its character as genuine legend.

Stories that exceed the boundaries of &quot;realism&quot; are called &quot;fables&quot;. For example, the talking animal formula of Aesop identifies his brief stories as fables and not legends. The parable of the Prodigal Son would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father. If it included a donkey that gave sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable.

Legend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in the original sense, through written text. Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot; or &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; comprises a series of &quot;vitae&quot; or instructive biographical narratives, tied to the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. They are presented as lives of the saints, but the profusion of miraculous happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of hagiography. The &quot;Legenda&quot; was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and sermons appropriate to the saint of the day.

==Urban legend==
Urban legends are a modern genre of folklore that is rooted in local popular culture, usually comprising fictional stories that are often presented as true, with macabre or humorous elements. These legends can be used for entertainment purposes, as well as semi-serious explanations for seemingly-mysterious events, such as disappearances and strange objects.

The term &quot;urban legend,&quot; as generally used by folklorists, has appeared in print since at least 1968. Jan Harold Brunvand, professor of English at the University of Utah, introduced the term to the general public in a series of popular books published beginning in 1981. Brunvand used his collection of legends, &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends &amp; Their Meanings&quot; (1981) to make two points: first, that legends and folklore do not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.

<text>Frederick Loewe ( ; born Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Löwe, ; June 10, 1901 – February 14, 1988) was an American composer. He collaborated with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner on a series of Broadway musicals, including &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, and &quot;Camelot&quot;, all of which were made into films, as well as the original film musical &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958), which was first transferred to the stage in 1973.

==Biography==
Loewe was born in Charlottenburg, Berlin, Germany, to Viennese parents Edmund and Rosa Loewe. His father was a Jewish operetta star who performed throughout Europe and in North and South America; he starred as Count Danilo in the 1906 Berlin production of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;.

Loewe grew up in Berlin and attended a Prussian cadet school from the age of five until he was thirteen. At an early age Loewe learned to play piano by ear and helped his father rehearse, and he began composing songs at age seven. He eventually attended the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, one year behind virtuoso Claudio Arrau, and studied with Ferruccio Busoni and Eugene d&#x27;Albert. He won the coveted Hollander Medal awarded by the school and gave performances as a concert pianist while still in Germany. At 13, he was the youngest piano soloist ever to appear with the Berlin Philharmonic.

In 1924, his father received an offer to appear in New York City, and Loewe traveled there with him, determined to write for Broadway. This proved to be difficult, and he took other odd jobs, including cattle punching, gold mining and prize fighting. He eventually found work playing piano in German clubs in Yorkville and in movie theaters as the accompanist for silent films. In 1931, he married Ernestine Zerline. Childless, they divorced in 1957.

Loewe began to visit the Lambs Club, a hangout for theater performers, producers, managers and directors. He credited The Lambs for keeping him working until his career expanded, and left a share of his royalties of &quot;Brigadoon&quot; to The Lambs Foundation. He met Alan Jay Lerner there in 1942. Their first collaboration was a musical adaptation of Barry Connor&#x27;s farce &quot;The Patsy&quot;, called &quot;Life of the Party&quot;, for a Detroit stock company. It enjoyed a nine-week run and encouraged the duo to join forces with Arthur Pierson for &quot;What&#x27;s Up?&quot;, which opened on Broadway in 1943. It ran for 63 performances and was followed by &quot;The Day Before Spring&quot;, which ran on Broadway from November 1945 to April 1946.

Their first hit was &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, a romantic fantasy set in a mystical Scottish village, directed by Robert Lewis with choreography by Agnes de Mille. The musical ran on Broadway from March 1947 to July 1948 and won the 1947 New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle award as Best Musical. It spawned the songs &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot; and &quot;The Heather on the Hill&quot;, both of which became standards. It was followed in 1951 by the less successful Gold Rush story &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, which despite its lukewarm critical reception included several songs which went on to become popular, including &quot;Wand&#x27;rin&#x27; Star&quot; and &quot;They Call the Wind Maria&quot;.

In 1956, Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; was produced on Broadway. Their adaptation of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, with the leads, Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, being played originally by Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews, was a huge hit on Broadway and in London. The musical won the Tony Award for Best Musical. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer took notice and commissioned them to write the film musical &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958), which won nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

Their next Broadway musical was &quot;Camelot&quot; in 1960. The production starred Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet. According to &quot;Playbill&quot;, &quot;The show achieved an unprecedented advance sale of three and a half million dollars, propelled in part by a preview on the Ed Sullivan Show that featured its stars, Richard Burton and Julie Andrews.&quot; &quot;Camelot&quot; ran for 873 performances.

Loewe then decided to retire to Palm Springs, California, where he bought a home in 1960. For many years he did not write anything until he was approached by Lerner to augment the &quot;Gigi&quot; film score with additional tunes for a 1973 stage adaptation, which won him his second Tony, this time for Best Original Score.

In 1974, they collaborated on a musical film version of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, based on the classic children&#x27;s tale by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.
 This film was a critical failure, but the soundtrack recording and the film itself are in print on CD and DVD. Loewe and Lerner were nominated for the 1974 Academy Award for Best Song and Best Adapted or Original Song Score (with Angela Morley and Douglas Gamley).

Loewe was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972. Seven years later, in 1979, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

Loewe remained in Palm Springs until his death at 86. The cause of death was cardiac arrest, according to John F. Morris, an artist and longtime friend. He had a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars dedicated to him in 1995. He was buried in the Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.

<text>Moss Hart (October 24, 1904 – December 20, 1961) was an American playwright, librettist, and theater director.

==Early years==
Hart was born in New York City, the son of Lillian (Solomon) and Barnett Hart, a cigar maker. He had a younger brother, Bernard. He grew up in relative poverty with his English-born Jewish immigrant parents in the Bronx and in Sea Gate, Brooklyn.

In his youth, he had a formative relationship with his Aunt Kate, who piqued his interest in the theater, often taking him to see performances. Hart even went so far as to create an &quot;alternate ending&quot; to her life in his book &quot;Act One&quot;. He learned that the theater made possible &quot;the art of being somebody else … not a scrawny boy with bad teeth, a funny name … and a mother who was a distant drudge.&quot;

Hart&#x27;s first glimpse of Broadway came in 1918 when he was 14 years old. He later recounted exiting the subway at Times Square and standing agog at the urban tableau before him: &quot;A swirling mob of shouting happy people... confetti and paper streamers... soldiers and sailors climbed happily onto the tops of taxis, grabbing girls up to dance with them. My first thought was &#x27;Of course, that&#x27;s just the way I thought it would be.&#x27;&quot; Unbeknownst to Hart, his arrival had coincided with the signing of the armistice that ended World War One.

==Career==

After working several years as a director of amateur theatrical groups and an entertainment director at summer resorts, he scored his first Broadway hit with &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; (1930), a farce about the arrival of the sound era in Hollywood. The play was written in collaboration with Broadway veteran George S. Kaufman, who regularly wrote with others, notably Marc Connelly and Edna Ferber. (Kaufman also performed in the play&#x27;s original Broadway cast in the role of a frustrated playwright hired by Hollywood) and produced by Sam Harris. Hart&#x27;s agent at this time was Frieda Fishbein, who brought a lawsuit against Hart, contending she was entitled to a percentage of the royalties from plays produced by Harris. The matter was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

During the next decade, Kaufman and Hart teamed on a string of successes, including &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1939). Though Kaufman had hits with others, Hart is generally conceded to be his most important collaborator.

&quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot;, the story of an eccentric family and how they live during the Depression, won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for drama. It is Hart&#x27;s most-revived play. When director Frank Capra and writer Robert Riskin adapted it for the screen in 1938, the film won the Best Picture Oscar and Capra won for Best Director.

&quot;The Man Who Came To Dinner&quot; is about the caustic Sheridan Whiteside who, after injuring himself slipping on ice, must stay in a Midwestern family&#x27;s house. The character was based on Kaufman and Hart&#x27;s friend, critic Alexander Woollcott. Other characters in the play are based on Noël Coward, Harpo Marx and Gertrude Lawrence.

Throughout the 1930s, Hart worked both with and without Kaufman on several musicals and revues, including &quot;Face the Music&quot; (1932); &quot;As Thousands Cheer&quot; (1933), with songs by Irving Berlin; &quot;Jubilee (musical)&quot; (1935), with songs by Cole Porter; and &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot; (1937), with songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. (Lorenz Hart and Moss Hart were not related.) 
After &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot; (1940), Kaufman and Hart called it quits. Hart continued to write plays after parting with Kaufman, such as &quot;Christopher Blake&quot; (1946) and &quot;Light Up the Sky&quot; (1948), as well as the book for the musical &quot;Lady In The Dark&quot; (1941), with songs by Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin. However, he became best known during this period as a director. Among the Broadway hits he staged were &quot;Junior Miss&quot; (1941), &quot;Dear Ruth&quot; (1944) and &quot;Anniversary Waltz&quot; (1954). By far his biggest hit was the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1956), adapted from George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. The show ran over six years and won a Tony Award for Best Musical. Hart picked up the Tony for Best Director.

In 1950 Hart was host of the game show &quot;Answer Yes or No&quot; on NBC television.

Hart also wrote some screenplays, including &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947) (for which he received an Oscar nomination), &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot; (1952) and &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1954). His memoir &quot;Act One: An Autobiography&quot; (1950) was adapted for film in 1963, with George Hamilton portraying Hart. 

The last show Hart directed was the Lerner and Loewe musical &quot;Camelot&quot; (1960). During a troubled out-of-town tryout, Hart had a heart attack. The show opened before he fully recovered, but he and Lerner reworked it after the opening. That, along with huge pre-sales and a cast performance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, helped ensure the expensive production was a hit. 

==Guild presidency==
Hart was the tenth president of the Dramatists Guild of America, from 1947 until 1956, when Oscar Hammerstein II became his successor.

==Personal life==
Hart married Kitty Carlisle on August 10, 1946; they had two children.

==Death==

Moss Hart died of a heart attack at the age of 57 on December 20, 1961, at his winter home in Palm Springs, California. He was entombed in a crypt at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

==Legacy==

In 1972, 11 years after his death, Moss Hart was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame, one of 23 people to be selected into the Hall of Fame&#x27;s first induction class that year. Alan Jay Lerner paid tribute to Hart in his memoir, &quot;The Street Where I Live&quot;.

===Moss Hart Awards===
The New England Theatre Conference offers the Moss Hart Memorial Award at their annual convention to theater groups in New England that put forth imaginative productions of exemplary scripts. These awards are designed to honor Moss Hart as well as the award recipients. Past winners include Wellesley Repertory Theatre, Staples Players, and Suffield Academy.

===Moss Hart and Kitty Carlisle Hart New Play Initiative===

Developed as an offshoot of the very successful New Play Initiative of Burbank, California&#x27;s Grove Theater Center, the Moss Hart and Kitty Carlisle Hart New Play Initiative (Hart NPI) expands the program to one of the few programs of its kind where a playwright will be guaranteed a production of his/her play in Los Angeles (Burbank), as well as an Off-Broadway Premiere at 59E59 Theaters in New York City. The GTC New Play Initiative is the brainchild of producers Charles Johanson and Kevin Cochran (founders of Grove Theater Center) and its expansion to a truly bi-coastal program with the focus on the author and their vision for their work. The Hart NPI is under the leadership of Moss Hart&#x27;s son Christopher Hart (artistic director), Kevin Cochran (producing artistic director) and Charles Johanson (executive director). In the first Hart NPI play cycle (2017-2018) there were 1,243 submissions from 44 states and 6 countries!. The Hart NPI will select 16-21 semifinalists, which will then be narrowed down to eight finalists and the eight will be narrowed down to the winners: Four Bronze Hart NPI winners will have a reading of their play at 59E59 Theaters, two Silver Hart NPI winners will have a production of their play in Los Angeles (Burbank), CA at the GTC Burbank and the Gold Hart NPI winner will have an Off-Broadway premiere at 59E59 Theaters. Dr. Catherine Hart (Moss and Kitty&#x27;s daughter, who also serves on the board of trustees of the Hart NPI) said that &quot;Having a program like this in Moss &amp; Kitty&#x27;s name would have made them proud.&quot;

<doc id="53979" wikidata="Q5965546" url="?curid=53979" title="I'd Rather Be Right">
<text>I&#x27;d Rather Be Right is a 1937 musical with a book by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman, lyrics by Lorenz Hart, and music by Richard Rodgers. The story is a Depression-era political satire set in New York City about Washington politics and political figures such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The plot centers on Peggy Jones (Joy Hodges) and her boyfriend Phil (Austin Marshall), who needs a raise in order for them to get married. The President steps in and solves their dilemma.

==Production==

&quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot; premiered on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre on November 2, 1937, produced by Sam H. Harris. It transferred to the Music Box Theatre, and ran for 290 performances. It starred George M. Cohan as Franklin D. Roosevelt. In such pieces as &quot;Off the Record&quot;, Cohan, as FDR, danced—not possible in real life for the President.

==Reception==
H. G. Wells wrote enthusiastically about the musical, and Cohan&#x27;s performance as Roosevelt, in an article &quot;The Fall in America 1937&quot;, published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on January 28, 1938, and reprinted in his &quot;World Brain&quot; (1938).

==Cultural references==
The musical is prominently featured in the 1942 Cohan biopic &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, in which it serves as a narrative bookend. James Cagney, playing Cohan, after meeting FDR in the Oval Office, performs a joyous tap dance as he walks back down the stairs of the White House. In the film, we also see Cagney as Cohan performing &quot;Off the Record&quot; during the show&#x27;s run. Because the film was made during World War II, the film also anachronistically added some morale-boosting lyrics at the end of the song.

<doc id="53982" wikidata="Q910324" url="?curid=53982" title="Euchromatin">
<text>Euchromatin (also called &quot;open chromatin&quot;) is a lightly packed form of chromatin (DNA, RNA, and protein) that is enriched in genes, and is often (but not always) under active transcription. Euchromatin stands in contrast to heterochromatin, which is tightly packed and less accessible for transcription. 92% of the human genome is euchromatic.

In eukaryotes, euchromatin comprises the most active portion of the genome within the cell nucleus. In prokaryotes, euchromatin is the &quot;only&quot; form of chromatin present; this indicates that the heterochromatin structure evolved later along with the nucleus, possibly as a mechanism to handle increasing genome size.

== Structure ==
Euchromatin is composed of repeating subunits known as nucleosomes, reminiscent of an unfolded set of beads on a string, that are approximately 11 nm in diameter. At the core of these nucleosomes are a set of four histone protein pairs: H3, H4, H2A, and H2B. Each core histone protein possesses a &#x27;tail&#x27; structure, which can vary in several ways; it is thought that these variations act as &quot;master control switches&quot; through different methylation and acetylation states, which determine the overall arrangement of the chromatin. Approximately 147 base pairs of DNA are wound around the histone octamers, or a little less than 2 turns of the helix. Nucleosomes along the strand are linked together via the histone, H1, and a short space of open linker DNA, ranging from around 0-80 base pairs. The key distinction between the structure of euchromatin and heterochromatin is that the nucleosomes in euchromatin are much more widely spaced, which allows for easier access of different protein complexes to the DNA strand and thus increased gene transcription.

==Appearance==

Euchromatin resembles a set of beads on a string at large magnifications. From farther away, it can resemble a ball of tangled thread, such as in some electron microscope visualizations. In both optical and electron microscopic visualizations, euchromatin appears lighter in color than heterochromatin - which is also present in the nucleus and appears darkly - due to its less compact structure. When visualizing chromosomes, such as in a karyogram, cytogenetic banding is used to stain the chromosomes. Cytogenetic banding allows us to see which parts of the chromosome are made up of euchromatin or heterochromatin in order to differentiate chromosomal subsections, irregularities or rearrangements. One such example is G banding, otherwise known as Giemsa staining where euchromatin appears lighter than heterochromatin.
== Function ==

=== Transcription ===
Euchromatin participates in the active transcription of DNA to mRNA products. The unfolded structure allows gene regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase complexes to bind to the DNA sequence, which can then initiate the transcription process. While not all euchromatin is necessarily transcribed, as the euchromatin is divided into transcriptionally active and inactive domains, euchromatin is still generally associated with active gene transcription. There is therefore a direct link to how actively productive a cell is and the amount of euchromatin that can be found in its nucleus.

It is thought that the cell uses transformation from euchromatin into heterochromatin as a method of controlling gene expression and replication, since such processes behave differently on densely compacted chromatin. This is known as the &#x27;accessibility hypothesis&#x27;. One example of constitutive euchromatin that is &#x27;always turned on&#x27; is housekeeping genes, which code for the proteins needed for basic functions of cell survival.

=== Epigenetics ===
Epigenetics involves changes in the phenotype that can be inherited without changing the DNA sequence. This can occur through many types of environmental interactions. Regarding euchromatin, post-translational modifications of the histones can alter the structure of chromatin, resulting in altered gene expression without changing the DNA. Additionally, a loss of heterochromatin and increase in euchromatin has been shown to correlate with an accelerated aging process, especially in diseases known to resemble premature aging. Research has shown epigenetic markers on histones for a number of additional diseases.

== Regulation ==
Euchromatin is primarily regulated by post-translational modifications to its nucleosomes&#x27; histones, conducted by many histone-modifying enzymes. These modifications occur on the histones&#x27; N-terminal tails that protrude from the nucleosome structure, and are thought of to recruit enzymes to either keep the chromatin in its open form, as euchromatin, or in its closed form, as heterochromatin. Histone acetylation, for instance, is typically associated with euchromatin structure, whereas histone methylation promotes heterochromatin remodeling. Acetylation makes the histone group more negatively charged, which in turn disrupts its interactions with the DNA strand, essentially &quot;opening&quot; the strand for easier access. Acetylation can occur on multiple lysine residues of a histone&#x27;s N-terminal tail and in different histones of the same nucleosome, which is thought to further increase DNA accessibility for transcription factors.

Phosphorylation of histones is another method by which euchromatin is regulated. This tends to occur on the N-terminal tails of the histones, however some sites are present in the core. Phosphorylation is controlled by kinases and phosphatases, which add and remove the phosphate groups respectively. This can occur at serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues present in euchromatin. Since the phosphate groups added to the structure will incorporate a negative charge, it will promote the more relaxed &quot;open&quot; form, similar to acetylation. In regards to functionality, histone phosphorylation is involved with gene expression, DNA damage repair, and chromatin remodeling.

Another method of regulation that incorporates a negative charge, thereby favoring the &quot;open&quot; form, is ADP ribosylation. This process adds one or more ADP-ribose units to the histone, and is involved in the DNA damage response pathway.

<text>Heterochromatin is a tightly packed form of DNA or &quot;condensed DNA&quot;, which comes in multiple varieties. These varieties lie on a continuum between the two extremes of [[constitutive heterochromatin]] and [[facultative heterochromatin]]. Both play a role in the expression of genes. Because it is tightly packed, it was thought to be inaccessible to polymerases and therefore not transcribed; however, according to Volpe et al. (2002), and many other papers since, much of this DNA is in fact transcribed, but it is continuously turned over via RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS). Recent studies with electron microscopy and OsO4 staining reveal that the dense packing is not due to the chromatin.

Constitutive heterochromatin can affect the genes near itself (e.g. position-effect variegation). It is usually repetitive and forms structural functions such as centromeres or telomeres, in addition to acting as an attractor for other gene-expression or repression signals.

Facultative heterochromatin is the result of genes that are silenced through a mechanism such as histone deacetylation or Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) through RNAi. It is not repetitive and shares the compact structure of constitutive heterochromatin. However, under specific developmental or environmental signaling cues, it can lose its condensed structure and become transcriptionally active.

Heterochromatin has been associated with the di- and tri -methylation of H3K9 in certain portions of the human genome. H3K9me3-related methyltransferases appear to have a pivotal role in modifying heterochromatin during lineage commitment at the onset of organogenesis and in maintaining lineage fidelity.

== Structure ==
Chromatin is found in two varieties: euchromatin and heterochromatin. Originally, the two forms were distinguished cytologically by how intensely they get stained – the euchromatin is less intense, while heterochromatin stains intensely, indicating tighter packing. Heterochromatin was given its name for this reason by botanist Emil Heitz who discovered that heterochromatin remained darkly stained throughout the entire cell cycle, unlike euchromatin whose stain disappeared during interphase. Heterochromatin is usually localized to the periphery of the nucleus.
Despite this early dichotomy, recent evidence in both animals and plants has suggested that there are more than two distinct heterochromatin states, and it may in fact exist in four or five &#x27;states&#x27;, each marked by different combinations of epigenetic marks.

Heterochromatin mainly consists of genetically inactive satellite sequences, and many genes are repressed to various extents, although some cannot be expressed in euchromatin at all. Both centromeres and telomeres are heterochromatic, as is the Barr body of the second, inactivated X-chromosome in a female.

== Function ==
Heterochromatin has been associated with several functions, from gene regulation to the protection of chromosome integrity; some of these roles can be attributed to the dense packing of DNA, which makes it less accessible to protein factors that usually bind DNA or its associated factors. For example, naked double-stranded DNA ends would usually be interpreted by the cell as damaged or viral DNA, triggering cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or destruction of the fragment, such as by endonucleases in bacteria.

Some regions of chromatin are very densely packed with fibers that display a condition comparable to that of the chromosome at mitosis. Heterochromatin is generally clonally inherited; when a cell divides, the two daughter cells typically contain heterochromatin within the same regions of DNA, resulting in epigenetic inheritance. Variations cause heterochromatin to encroach on adjacent genes or recede from genes at the extremes of domains. Transcribable material may be repressed by being positioned (in &quot;cis&quot;) at these boundary domains. This gives rise to expression levels that vary from cell to cell, which may be demonstrated by position-effect variegation. Insulator sequences may act as a barrier in rare cases where constitutive heterochromatin and highly active genes are juxtaposed (e.g. the 5&#x27;HS4 insulator upstream of the chicken β-globin locus, and loci in two &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; spp.).

==Constitutive heterochromatin==

All cells of a given species package the same regions of DNA in constitutive heterochromatin, and thus in all cells, any genes contained within the constitutive heterochromatin will be poorly expressed. For example, all human chromosomes 1, 9, 16, and the Y-chromosome contain large regions of constitutive heterochromatin. In most organisms, constitutive heterochromatin occurs around the chromosome centromere and near telomeres.

==Facultative heterochromatin==

The regions of DNA packaged in facultative heterochromatin will not be consistent between the cell types within a species, and thus a sequence in one cell that is packaged in facultative heterochromatin (and the genes within are poorly expressed) may be packaged in euchromatin in another cell (and the genes within are no longer silenced). However, the formation of facultative heterochromatin is regulated, and is often associated with morphogenesis or differentiation. An example of facultative heterochromatin is X chromosome inactivation in female mammals: one X chromosome is packaged as facultative heterochromatin and silenced, while the other X chromosome is packaged as euchromatin and expressed.

Among the molecular components that appear to regulate the spreading of heterochromatin are the Polycomb-group proteins and non-coding genes such as Xist. The mechanism for such spreading is still a matter of controversy. The polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 regulate chromatin compaction and gene expression and have a fundamental role in developmental processes. PRC-mediated epigenetic aberrations are linked to genome instability and malignancy and play a role in the DNA damage response, DNA repair and in the fidelity of replication.

==Yeast heterochromatin==
&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, or budding yeast, is a model eukaryote and its heterochromatin has been defined thoroughly. Although most of its genome can be characterized as euchromatin, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has regions of DNA that are transcribed very poorly. These loci are the so-called silent mating type loci (HML and HMR), the rDNA (encoding ribosomal RNA), and the sub-telomeric regions.
Fission yeast (&quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;) uses another mechanism for heterochromatin formation at its centromeres. Gene silencing at this location depends on components of the RNAi pathway. Double-stranded RNA is believed to result in silencing of the region through a series of steps.

In the fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;, two RNAi complexes, the RITS complex and the RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex (RDRC), are part of an RNAi machinery involved in the initiation, propagation and maintenance of heterochromatin assembly. These two complexes localize in a siRNA-dependent manner on chromosomes, at the site of heterochromatin assembly. RNA polymerase II synthesizes a transcript that serves as a platform to recruit RITS, RDRC and possibly other complexes required for heterochromatin assembly. Both RNAi and an exosome-dependent RNA degradation process contribute to heterochromatic gene silencing. These mechanisms of &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; may occur in other eukaryotes. A large RNA structure called RevCen has also been implicated in the production of siRNAs to mediate heterochromatin formation in some fission yeast.

<text>A fallacy is the use of invalid or otherwise faulty reasoning in the construction of an argument that may appear to be well-reasoned if unnoticed. The term was introduced in the Western intellectual tradition by the Aristotelian &quot;De Sophisticis Elenchis&quot;. 

Fallacies may be committed intentionally to manipulate or persuade by deception, unintentionally because of human limitations such as carelessness, cognitive or social biases and ignorance, or potentially due to the limitations of language and understanding of language. These delineations include not only the ignorance of the right reasoning standard but also the ignorance of relevant properties of the context. For instance, the soundness of legal arguments depends on the context in which they are made.

Fallacies are commonly divided into &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;informal&quot;. A formal fallacy is a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument that renders the argument invalid, while an informal fallacy originates in an error in reasoning other than an improper logical form. Arguments containing informal fallacies may be formally valid, but still fallacious.

A special case is a mathematical fallacy, an intentionally invalid mathematical proof with a concealed, or subtle, error. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of false proofs of obvious contradictions.

== Overview ==
Fallacies are types of erroneous reasoning that render arguments logically unsound. According to The New Handbook of Cognitive Therapy Techniques, they include &quot;unsubstantiated assertions that are often delivered with a conviction that makes them sound as though they are proven facts&quot;. Informal fallacies, in particular, are frequently found in mass media such as television and newspapers. Understanding fallacies may allow one to recognize them in either one&#x27;s own or others&#x27; writing. Avoiding fallacies may help improve one&#x27;s ability to produce sound arguments.

It can be difficult to evaluate whether an argument is fallacious, as arguments exist along a continuum of soundness and an argument that has several stages or parts might have some sound sections and some fallacious ones. Moreover, whether a specific argument is fallacious often depends on the content rather than the form of the argument. An example is a probabilistically valid instance of the formally invalid argument form of denying the antecedent or affirming the consequent. Thus, &quot;fallacious arguments usually have the deceptive appearance of being good arguments, because for most fallacious instances of an argument form, a similar but non-fallacious instance can be found&quot;. Evaluating an instance of an argument as fallacious is therefore often a matter of evaluating the context of the argument. 

Recognizing fallacies in everyday arguments may be difficult since arguments are often embedded in rhetorical patterns that obscure the logical connections between statements. Informal fallacies may also exploit the emotional, intellectual, or psychological weaknesses of the audience. Recognizing fallacies can develop reasoning skills to expose the weaker links between premises and conclusions to better discern between what appears to be true and what is true.

Argumentation theory provides a different approach to understanding and classifying fallacies. In the pragma-dialectical theory, for instance, an argument is regarded as an interactive protocol between individuals who attempt to resolve their disagreement on the merits of a case. The protocol consists of normative rules of interaction, and violations of these rules are considered fallacies because they frustrate the attempt at resolving the disagreement.

Fallacies are used in place of valid reasoning to communicate a point with the intention to persuade. Examples in the mass media today include but are not limited to propaganda, advertisements, politics, newspaper editorials, and opinion-based news shows.

== Systems of classification ==
Fallacies are generally classified strictly by either their structure or their content, such as by classifying them as formal fallacies or informal fallacies, respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption. Alternatively, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as material fallacies (content), verbal fallacies (linguistic), and formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies. Verbal fallacies may be placed in either formal or informal classifications: Compare equivocation, which is a word- or phrase-based ambiguity, to the fallacy of composition, which is premise- and inference-based ambiguity.

=== Greek logic ===
The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) was the first to systematize logical errors into a list to make it easier to refute an opponent&#x27;s thesis and thus win an argument. Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot; () identifies thirteen fallacies. He divided them up into two major types: linguistic fallacies and non-linguistic fallacies, some of which depend on language and others that do not. These fallacies are called verbal fallacies and material fallacies, respectively. A material fallacy is an error in what the arguer is talking about, while a verbal fallacy is an error in how the arguer is talking. Verbal fallacies are those in which a conclusion is obtained by improper or ambiguous use of words.
An example of a language dependent fallacy is given as a debate as to who in humanity are learners: the wise or the ignorant. A language-independent fallacy is, for example:
# &quot;Coriscus is different from Socrates.&quot;
# &quot;Socrates is a man.&quot;
# &quot;Therefore, Coriscus is different from a man.&quot;

=== Indian logic ===
Indian logicians took great pains to identify fallacies in arguments. An influential collection of texts on logic and reason, the &quot;Nyāya Sūtras&quot;, attributed to Aksapada Gautama, variously estimated to have been composed between the 6th century BCE and the 2nd century CE, lists in its theory of inference five such reasons used in an argument that was further developed by later logicians.

# &quot;Asiddha&quot;: It is the unproved reason that results in this fallacy. [Paksadharmata]
# &quot;Savyabhichara&quot;: This is the fallacy of irregular reason.
# &quot;Satpratipaksa&quot;: Here the reason is contradicted by another reason. If both have equal force, then nothing follows. &#x27;Sound is eternal, because it is audible&#x27;, and &#x27;Sound is non-eternal, because it is produced&#x27;. Here &#x27;audible&#x27; is counterbalanced by &#x27;produced&#x27; and both are of equal force.
# &quot;Badhita&quot;: When another proof (as by perception) definitely contradicts and disproves the middle term (reason). &#x27;Fire is cold because it is a substance&#x27;.
# &quot;Viruddha&quot;: Instead of proving something it is proving the opposite. &#x27;Sound is eternal because it is produced&#x27;.

=== Whately&#x27;s grouping ===
English scholar and theologian Richard Whately (1787–1863) defines a fallacy broadly as, &quot;any argument, or apparent argument, which professes to be decisive of the matter at hand, while in reality it is not&quot;.

Whately divided fallacies into two groups: &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;material&quot;. According to Whately, logical fallacies are arguments where the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Material fallacies are not logical errors because the conclusion follows from the premises. He then divided the logical group into two groups: purely logical and semi-logical. The semi-logical group included all of Aristotle&#x27;s sophisms except &quot;ignoratio elenchi&quot;, &quot;petitio principii&quot;, and &quot;non causa pro causa&quot;, which are in the material group.

=== Other systems of classification ===
Other famous methods of classifying fallacies are those of Francis Bacon and J. S. Mill. Bacon (&quot;Novum Organum&quot;, Aph. 33, 38 sqq.) divided fallacies into four Idola (Idols, i.e. False Appearances), which summarize the various kinds of mistakes to which the human intellect is prone. J. S. Mill discussed the subject in book five of his Logic, and Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Book of Fallacies&quot; (1824) contains valuable remarks.

== Formal fallacy ==
A formal fallacy, deductive fallacy, logical fallacy or &quot;non sequitur&quot; (Latin for &quot;it does not follow&quot;) is a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument that renders the argument invalid. The flaw can be expressed in the standard system of logic. Such an argument is always considered to be wrong.
The presence of the formal fallacy does not imply anything about the argument&#x27;s premises or its conclusion. Both may actually be true or may even be more probable as a result of the argument, but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described.

Even non-deductive arguments can be said to be fallacious: for example, an inductive argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or causality. But &quot;since deductive arguments depend on formal properties and inductive arguments don&#x27;t, formal fallacies apply only to deductive arguments&quot;.

A logical form such as &quot;&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;&quot; is independent of any particular conjunction of meaningful propositions. Logical form alone can guarantee that, given true premises, a true conclusion must follow. However, formal logic makes no such guarantee if any premise is false; the conclusion can be either true or false. Any formal error or logical fallacy similarly invalidates the deductive guarantee. Both the argument and all its premises must be true for a conclusion to be true.

The term &quot;non sequitur&quot; denotes a general formal fallacy, often meaning one that does not belong to any named subclass of formal fallacies, like affirming the consequent.

=== Common examples ===
==== Ecological fallacy ====
An ecological fallacy is committed when one draws an inference from data based on the premise that qualities observed for groups necessarily hold for individuals; for example, &quot;if countries with more Protestants tend to have higher suicide rates, then Protestants must be more likely to commit suicide&quot;.

==== Observational interpretation fallacy ====

The &quot;observational interpretation fallacy&quot; is a cognitive bias that occurs exclusively in the medical field, leading to the mistaken interpretation of observed associations as causal relationships, negatively impacting medical guidelines, clinical decisions, and healthcare practices, potentially compromising patient safety.

=== Fallacy fork ===
Maarten Boudry and others have argued that formal, deductive fallacies rarely occur in real life and that arguments that would be fallacious in formally deductive terms are not necessarily so when context and prior probabilities are taken into account, thus making the argument defeasible and/or inductive. Boudry coined the term &quot;fallacy fork&quot;. For a given fallacy, one must either characterize it by means of a deductive argumentation scheme, which rarely applies (the first prong of the fork), or one must relax definitions and add nuance to take the actual intent and context of the argument into account (the other prong of the fork). To argue, for example, that one became nauseated after eating a mushroom because the mushroom was poisonous could be an example of the &quot;post hoc ergo propter hoc&quot; fallacy.

== Informal fallacy ==

In contrast to a formal fallacy, an informal fallacy originates from a reasoning error other than a flaw in the logical form of the argument. A deductive argument containing an informal fallacy may be formally valid, but still remain rationally unpersuasive. Nevertheless, informal fallacies apply to both deductive and non-deductive arguments.

Though the form of the argument may be relevant, fallacies of this type are &quot;types of mistakes in reasoning that arise from the mishandling of the &quot;content&quot; of the propositions constituting the argument&quot;.

=== Faulty generalization ===
A special subclass of the informal fallacies is the set of faulty generalizations, also known as inductive fallacies. Here, the most important issue concerns inductive strength or methodology (for example, statistical inference). In the absence of sufficient evidence, drawing conclusions based on induction is unwarranted and fallacious. With the backing of sufficient amounts of the right type of empirical evidence, however, the conclusions may become warranted and convincing (at which point the arguments are no longer considered fallacious).

==== Hasty generalization ====
Hasty generalization is described as making assumptions about a whole group or range of cases based on a sample that is inadequate (usually because it is atypical or just too small).
Stereotypes about people (&quot;frat boys are drunkards&quot;, &quot;grad students are nerdy&quot;, &quot;women don&#x27;t enjoy sports&quot;, etc.) are common examples of the principle.

Hasty generalization often follows a pattern such as:

:X is true for A.
:X is true for B.
:Therefore, X is true for C, D, etc.

While never a valid logical deduction, if such an inference can be made on statistical grounds, it may nonetheless be convincing. This is because with enough empirical evidence, the generalization is no longer a hasty one.

=== Relevance fallacy ===
The fallacies of relevance are a broad class of informal fallacies, generically represented by missing the point: presenting an argument that may be sound but fails to address the issue in question.

==== Argument from silence ====
An argument from silence is a faulty conclusion that is drawn based on the absence of evidence rather than on the presence of evidence.

=== Examples of informal fallacies ===
==== &quot;Post hoc&quot; (false cause) ====
The post hoc fallacy assumes that because B comes after A, A caused B. It gets its name from the Latin phrase &quot;post hoc, ergo propter hoc&quot;, which translates as &quot;after this, therefore because of this&quot;. 

Sometimes one event really does cause another one that comes later—for example, if one registers for a class and their name later appears on the roll, it&#x27;s true that the first event caused the one that came later. But sometimes two events that seem related in time are not really related as cause and event. That is, temporal correlation does not necessarily entail causation. For example, if one eats a sandwich and then gets food poisoning, that does not necessarily mean the sandwich caused the food poisoning. Something else eaten earlier might have caused the food poisoning.

==== Slippery slope ====
For an argument to be a slippery slope type of argument, it must meet the requirements of that argumentation scheme. A slippery slope argument originates from a conversation or debate in which two actors take turns. It usually originates from one actor giving advice on a decision or act. Along the way, the actor must make additional choices on similar matters through which the actor enters the ‘grey area’ of the slippery slope. At this point, the actor potentially loses control over the direction of the arguments, thus leading to a ‘fatal’ outcome.

Such an argument is built up according to the following argumentation scheme: initial premise, sequential premise, indeterminacy premise, control premise, loss of control premise, catastrophic outcome premise, and conclusion. Slippery slope arguments may be defeated by asking critical questions or giving counterarguments.

There are several reasons for a slippery slope to be fallacious: for example, the argument is going too far into the future, it is a too complex argument whose structure is hard to identify, or the argument makes emotional appeals.

It may be that a slippery slope is not necessarily fallacious if context is taken into account and there is an effort to assess plausibility.

==== False analogy ====
Informally known as the &quot;apples and oranges&quot; fallacy, a false analogy uses unsound comparisons.

==== Straw man fallacy ====
The straw man fallacy refers to the refutation of a standpoint in an argument that was never proposed. The fallacy usually occurs in the presentation of an opponent&#x27;s standpoint as more extreme, distorted, or simplistic than it actually is. Compared to criticizing the opponent&#x27;s actual standpoint, this allows the arguer to offer a seeming refutation of what is, however, not the actual standpoint. Such an argument involves two arguers, with one criticizing the other&#x27;s perspective. The reason for the straw man argument to be fallacious originates from the problem of how to deal with natural discourse. The opponent&#x27;s argument is not reflected by the arguments that are proposed by the speaker.

== Measurement fallacy ==
Some of the fallacies described above may be committed in the context of measurement.
Where mathematical fallacies are subtle mistakes in reasoning leading to invalid mathematical proofs, measurement fallacies are unwarranted inferential leaps involved in the extrapolation of raw data to a measurement-based value claim. The ancient Greek Sophist Protagoras was one of the first thinkers to propose that humans can generate reliable measurements through his &quot;human-measure&quot; principle and the practice of &quot;dissoi logoi&quot; (arguing multiple sides of an issue). This history helps explain why measurement fallacies are informed by informal logic and argumentation theory.

=== Knowledge value measurement fallacy ===
The increasing availability and circulation of big data are driving a proliferation of new metrics for scholarly authority, and there is lively discussion regarding the relative usefulness of such metrics for measuring the value of knowledge production in the context of an &quot;information tsunami&quot;.

For example, anchoring fallacies can occur when unwarranted weight is given to data generated by metrics that the arguers themselves acknowledge are flawed. For example, the limitations of the journal impact factor (JIF) are well documented, and even JIF pioneer Eugene Garfield notes that, &quot;while citation data create new tools for analyses of research performance, it should be stressed that they supplement rather than replace other quantitative and qualitative indicators&quot;. To the extent that arguers jettison the acknowledged limitations of JIF-generated data in evaluative judgments or leave behind Garfield&#x27;s &quot;supplement rather than replace&quot; caveat, they commit anchoring fallacies.

The observational interpretation fallacy is the cognitive bias where association identified in observational studies are misinterpreted as causal relationships.

A naturalistic fallacy can occur, for example, in the case of sheer quantity metrics based on the premise &quot;more is better&quot; or, in the case of developmental assessment in the field of psychology, &quot;higher is better&quot;.

A false analogy occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons between data points. For example, the Scopus and Web of Science bibliographic databases have difficulty distinguishing between citations of scholarly work that are arms-length endorsements, ceremonial citations, or negative citations (indicating the citing author withholds endorsement of the cited work). Hence, measurement-based value claims premised on the uniform quality of all citations may be questioned on false analogy grounds.

As another example, consider the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index of Academic Analytics. This tool purports to measure overall faculty productivity, yet it does not capture data based on citations in books. This creates a possibility that low productivity measurements using the tool commit argument from silence fallacies, to the extent that such measurements are supported by the absence of book citation data.

Ecological fallacies can be committed when one measures the scholarly productivity of a sub-group of individuals (e.g. &quot;Puerto Rican&quot; faculty) via reference to aggregate data about a larger and different group (e.g., &quot;Hispanic&quot; faculty).

== Intentional fallacy ==
Sometimes a speaker or writer uses a fallacy intentionally. In any context, including academic debate, a conversation among friends, political discourse, advertising, or comedic purposes, the arguer may use fallacious reasoning to try to persuade the listener or reader, by means other than offering relevant evidence, that the conclusion is true.

Examples of this include the speaker or writer:

# Diverting the argument to unrelated issues with a red herring (&quot;Ignoratio elenchi&quot;)
# Insulting someone&#x27;s character (&quot;argumentum ad hominem&quot;)
# Assuming the conclusion of an argument, a kind of circular reasoning, also called &quot;begging the question&quot; (&quot;petitio principii&quot;)
# Making jumps in logic (&quot;non sequitur&quot;)
# Identifying a false cause and effect (&quot;post hoc ergo propter hoc&quot;)
# Asserting that everyone agrees (&quot;argumentum ad populum&quot;, bandwagoning)
# Creating a false dilemma (either-or fallacy) in which the situation is oversimplified, also called &quot;false dichotomy&quot;
# Selectively using facts (card stacking)
# Making false or misleading comparisons (false equivalence or false analogy)
# Generalizing quickly and sloppily (hasty generalization) (&quot;secundum quid&quot;)
# Using an argument&#x27;s connections to other concepts or people to support or refute it, also called &quot;guilt by association&quot; (association fallacy)
# Claiming that a lack of proof counts as proof (appeal to ignorance)

In humor, errors of reasoning are used for comical purposes. Groucho Marx used fallacies of amphiboly, for instance, to make ironic statements; Gary Larson and Scott Adams employed fallacious reasoning in many of their cartoons. Wes Boyer and Samuel Stoddard have written a humorous essay teaching students how to be persuasive by means of a whole host of informal and formal fallacies.

When someone uses logical fallacies intentionally to mislead in academic, political, or other high-stakes contexts, the breach of trust calls into question the authority and intellectual integrity of that person.

== Assessment: pragmatic theory ==

According to the pragmatic theory, a fallacy can be either a heuristic error or a ploy used intentionally to unfairly win an argument. There are always two parties to an argument containing a fallacy: the perpetrator and the intended victim. 

The dialogue framework required to support the pragmatic theory of fallacy is built on the presumption that argumentative dialogue has both an adversarial component and a collaborative component. A dialogue has individual goals for each participant as well as shared goals that apply to all participants. A fallacy of the second kind is seen as more than simply a violation of the rule of reasonable dialogue. It is also a deceptive tactic of argumentation based on sleight-of-hand. Aristotle explicitly compared contentious reasoning to unfair fighting in athletic contests. But the roots of the pragmatic theory go back even further in history, to the Sophists. The pragmatic theory finds its roots in the Aristotelian conception of a fallacy as a sophistical refutation but also supports the view that many of the types of arguments traditionally labeled as fallacies are in fact reasonable techniques of argumentation that can be used, in many cases, to support legitimate goals of dialogue. Hence, under the pragmatic approach, each case needs to be analyzed individually to determine whether the argument is fallacious or reasonable.

<text>The Cornales are an order of flowering plants, early diverging among the asterids, containing about 600 species. Plants within the Cornales usually have four-parted flowers, drupaceous fruits, and inferior to half-inferior gynoecia topped with disc-shaped nectaries.

==Taxonomy ==

In the classification system of Dahlgren the Cornales were in the superorder Corniflorae (also called Cornanae). Under the APG IV system, the Cornales order includes these families:

* Cornaceae (the dogwood family)
* Curtisiaceae (cape lancewood)
* Grubbiaceae (the sillyberry family)
* Hydrangeaceae (the hydrangea family)
* Hydrostachyaceae
* Loasaceae (the stickleaf family)
* Nyssaceae, (the tupelos)

The oldest fossils assigned with confidence to the order are &quot;Hironoia fusiformis&quot;, described from Coniacian age Japanese coalified fruits, and &quot;Suciacarpa starrii&quot; described from American permineralized fruits of Campanian age.

===Phylogeny===

The Cornales order is sister to the remainder of the large and diverse asterid clade. 
The Cornales are highly geographically disjunct and morphologically diverse, which has led to considerable confusion regarding the proper circumscription of the groups within the order and the relationships between them. Under the Cronquist system, the order comprised the families Cornaceae, Nyssaceae, Garryaceae, and Alangiaceae, and was placed among the Rosidae, but this interpretation is no longer followed. Many families and genera previously associated with the Cornales have been removed, including Garryaceae, &quot;Griselinia&quot;, &quot;Corokia&quot;, and &quot;Kaliphora&quot;, among others.

Likely cladogram for Cornales:
Molecular data suggest four clades are within the Cornales: &quot;Cornus-Alangium&quot;, nyssoids-mastixioids, Hydrangeaceae-Loasaceae, and &quot;Grubbia-Curtisia&quot;, with the Hydrostachyaceae in an uncertain position, possibly basal. However, the relationship between these clades is unclear, and as a result of many historical taxonomic interpretations and differing opinions regarding the significance of morphological variations, rankings of taxa within the order are inconsistent. These difficulties in interpreting the systematics of Cornales may represent an early and rapid diversification of the groups within the order.

<doc id="53991" wikidata="Q357858" url="?curid=53991" title="Adjoint functors">
<text>In mathematics, specifically category theory, adjunction is a relationship that two functors may exhibit, intuitively corresponding to a weak form of equivalence between two related categories. Two functors that stand in this relationship are known as adjoint functors, one being the left adjoint and the other the right adjoint. Pairs of adjoint functors are ubiquitous in mathematics and often arise from constructions of &quot;optimal solutions&quot; to certain problems (i.e., constructions of objects having a certain universal property), such as the construction of a free group on a set in algebra, or the construction of the Stone–Čech compactification of a topological space in topology.

By definition, an adjunction between categories formula_1 and formula_2 is a pair of functors (assumed to be covariant)

:formula_3   and   formula_4

and, for all objects formula_5 in formula_1 and formula_7 in formula_2, a bijection between the respective morphism sets

:formula_9

such that this family of bijections is natural in formula_5 and formula_7. Naturality here means that there are natural isomorphisms between the pair of functors formula_12 and formula_13 for a fixed formula_5 in formula_1, and also the pair of functors formula_16 and formula_17 for a fixed formula_7 in formula_2.

The functor formula_20 is called a left adjoint functor or left adjoint to formula_21, while formula_21 is called a right adjoint functor or right adjoint to formula_20. We write formula_24.

An adjunction between categories formula_1 and formula_2 is somewhat akin to a &quot;weak form&quot; of an equivalence between formula_1 and formula_2, and indeed every equivalence is an adjunction. In many situations, an adjunction can be &quot;upgraded&quot; to an equivalence, by a suitable natural modification of the involved categories and functors.

== Terminology and notation ==

The terms &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; are both used, and are cognates: one is taken directly from Latin, the other from Latin via French. In the classic text &quot;Categories for the Working Mathematician&quot;, Mac Lane makes a distinction between the two. Given a family

: formula_29

of hom-set bijections, we call formula_30 an adjunction or an adjunction between formula_31 and formula_32. If formula_33 is an arrow in formula_34, formula_35 is the right adjunct of formula_33 (p. 81). The functor formula_31 is left adjoint to formula_21, and formula_21 is right adjoint to formula_20. (Note that formula_21 may have itself a right adjoint that is quite different from formula_20; see below for an example.)

In general, the phrases &quot;formula_31 is a left adjoint&quot; and &quot;formula_31 has a right adjoint&quot; are equivalent. We call formula_20 a left adjoint because it is applied to the left argument of formula_46, and formula_21 a right adjoint because it is applied to the right argument of formula_48.

If &quot;F&quot; is left adjoint to &quot;G&quot;, we also write
:formula_49

The terminology comes from the Hilbert space idea of adjoint operators formula_50, formula_51 with formula_52, which is formally similar to the above relation between hom-sets. The analogy to adjoint maps of Hilbert spaces can be made precise in certain contexts.

== Introduction and motivation ==

Common mathematical constructions are very often adjoint functors. Consequently, general theorems about left/right adjoint functors encode the details of many useful and otherwise non-trivial results. Such general theorems include the equivalence of the various definitions of adjoint functors, the uniqueness of a right adjoint for a given left adjoint, the fact that left/right adjoint functors respectively preserve colimits/limits (which are also found in every area of mathematics), and the general adjoint functor theorems giving conditions under which a given functor is a left/right adjoint.

=== Solutions to optimization problems ===
In a sense, an adjoint functor is a way of giving the &quot;most efficient&quot; solution to some problem via a method that is &quot;formulaic&quot;. For example, an elementary problem in ring theory is how to turn a rng (which is like a ring that might not have a multiplicative identity) into a ring. The &quot;most efficient&quot; way is to adjoin an element &#x27;1&#x27; to the rng, adjoin all (and only) the elements that are necessary for satisfying the ring axioms (e.g. &quot;r&quot;+1 for each &quot;r&quot; in the ring), and impose no relations in the newly formed ring that are not forced by axioms. Moreover, this construction is &quot;formulaic&quot; in the sense that it works in essentially the same way for any rng.

This is rather vague, though suggestive, and can be made precise in the language of category theory: a construction is &quot;most efficient&quot; if it satisfies a universal property, and is &quot;formulaic&quot; if it defines a functor. Universal properties come in two types: initial properties and terminal properties. Since these are dual notions, it is only necessary to discuss one of them.

The idea of using an initial property is to set up the problem in terms of some auxiliary category &quot;E&quot;, so that the problem at hand corresponds to finding an initial object of &quot;E&quot;. This has an advantage that the &quot;optimization&quot;—the sense that the process finds the &quot;most efficient&quot; solution—means something rigorous and recognisable, rather like the attainment of a supremum. The category &quot;E&quot; is also formulaic in this construction, since it is always the category of elements of the functor to which one is constructing an adjoint.

Back to our example: take the given rng &quot;R&quot;, and make a category &quot;E&quot; whose &quot;objects&quot; are rng homomorphisms &quot;R&quot; → &quot;S&quot;, with &quot;S&quot; a ring having a multiplicative identity. The &quot;morphisms&quot; in &quot;E&quot; between &quot;R&quot; → &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;R&quot; → &quot;S&quot;2 are commutative triangles of the form (&quot;R&quot; → &quot;S&quot;1, &quot;R&quot; → &quot;S&quot;2, &quot;S&quot;1 → &quot;S&quot;2) where S1 → S2 is a ring map (which preserves the identity). (Note that this is precisely the definition of the comma category of &quot;R&quot; over the inclusion of unitary rings into rng.) The existence of a morphism between &quot;R&quot; → &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;R&quot; → &quot;S&quot;2 implies that &quot;S&quot;1 is at least as efficient a solution as &quot;S&quot;2 to our problem: &quot;S&quot;2 can have more adjoined elements and/or more relations not imposed by axioms than &quot;S&quot;1.
Therefore, the assertion that an object &quot;R&quot; → &quot;R*&quot; is initial in &quot;E&quot;, that is, that there is a morphism from it to any other element of &quot;E&quot;, means that the ring &quot;R&quot;* is a &quot;most efficient&quot; solution to our problem.

The two facts that this method of turning rngs into rings is &quot;most efficient&quot; and &quot;formulaic&quot; can be expressed simultaneously by saying that it defines an &quot;adjoint functor&quot;. More explicitly: Let &quot;F&quot; denote the above process of adjoining an identity to a rng, so &quot;F&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)=&quot;R*&quot;. Let &quot;G&quot; denote the process of “forgetting″ whether a ring &quot;S&quot; has an identity and considering it simply as a rng, so essentially &quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;)=&quot;S&quot;. Then &quot;F&quot; is the &quot;left adjoint functor&quot; of &quot;G&quot;.

Note however that we haven&#x27;t actually constructed &quot;R*&quot; yet; it is an important and not altogether trivial algebraic fact that such a left adjoint functor &quot;R&quot; → &quot;R*&quot; actually exists.

===Symmetry of optimization problems===

It is also possible to &quot;start&quot; with the functor &quot;F&quot;, and pose the following (vague) question: is there a problem to which &quot;F&quot; is the most efficient solution?

The notion that &quot;F&quot; is the &quot;most efficient solution&quot; to the problem posed by &quot;G&quot; is, in a certain rigorous sense, equivalent to the notion that &quot;G&quot; poses the &quot;most difficult problem&quot; that &quot;F&quot; solves.

This gives the intuition behind the fact that adjoint functors occur in pairs: if &quot;F&quot; is left adjoint to &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; is right adjoint to &quot;F&quot;.

==Formal definitions==

There are various equivalent definitions for adjoint functors:

* The definitions via universal morphisms are easy to state, and require minimal verifications when constructing an adjoint functor or proving two functors are adjoint. They are also the most analogous to our intuition involving optimizations.
* The definition via hom-sets makes symmetry the most apparent, and is the reason for using the word &quot;adjoint&quot;.
* The definition via counit–unit adjunction is convenient for proofs about functors that are known to be adjoint, because they provide formulas that can be directly manipulated.

The equivalency of these definitions is quite useful. Adjoint functors arise everywhere, in all areas of mathematics. Since the structure in any of these definitions gives rise to the structures in the others, switching between them makes implicit use of many details that would otherwise have to be repeated separately in every subject area.

===Conventions===

The theory of adjoints has the terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; at its foundation, and there are many components that live in one of two categories &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; that are under consideration. Therefore it can be helpful to choose letters in alphabetical order according to whether they live in the &quot;lefthand&quot; category &quot;C&quot; or the &quot;righthand&quot; category &quot;D&quot;, and also to write them down in this order whenever possible.

In this article for example, the letters &quot;X&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, ε will consistently denote things that live in the category &quot;C&quot;, the letters &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, η will consistently denote things that live in the category &quot;D&quot;, and whenever possible such things will be referred to in order from left to right (a functor &quot;F&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot; can be thought of as &quot;living&quot; where its outputs are, in &quot;C&quot;). If the arrows for the left adjoint functor F were drawn they would be pointing to the left; if the arrows for the right adjoint functor G were drawn they would be pointing to the right.

===Definition via universal morphisms===

By definition, a functor 
formula_53 is a left adjoint functor if for each object formula_54 in formula_1 there exists a universal morphism 
from formula_20 to formula_54. Spelled out, this means that for each object formula_54 in formula_1 there exists an object 
formula_60 in formula_2 and a morphism formula_62 such that for every object 
formula_63 in formula_2 and every morphism formula_65 there exists a unique morphism 
formula_66 with formula_67.

The latter equation is expressed by the following commutative diagram:
In this situation, one can show that formula_21 can be turned into a functor formula_69 in a unique way such that 
formula_70 
for all morphisms formula_71 in formula_1; formula_20 is then called a left adjoint to formula_21.

Similarly, we may define right-adjoint functors. A functor formula_75 is a right adjoint functor if for each object formula_63 in formula_2, 
there exists a universal morphism from formula_63 to formula_21. Spelled out, this means that for each object formula_63 in formula_2, 
there exists an object formula_82 in formula_83 and a morphism formula_84 such that for every object formula_54 in formula_1 
and every morphism formula_66 there exists a unique morphism formula_65 with formula_89.
Again, this formula_20 can be uniquely turned into a functor formula_53 such that formula_92 for formula_93 a morphism in formula_2; formula_21 is then called a right adjoint to formula_20.

It is true, as the terminology implies, that formula_20 is left adjoint to formula_21 if and only if formula_21 is right adjoint to formula_20.

These definitions via universal morphisms are often useful for establishing that a given functor is left or right adjoint, because they are minimalistic in their requirements. They are also intuitively meaningful in that finding a universal morphism is like solving an optimization problem.

===Definition via Hom-sets===

Using hom-sets, an adjunction between two categories formula_1 and formula_2 can be defined as consisting of two functors formula_103 and formula_104 and a natural isomorphism
:formula_105.
This specifies a family of bijections
:formula_106
for all objects formula_107 and formula_108.

In this situation, formula_20 is left adjoint to formula_21 and formula_21 is right adjoint to formula_20.

This definition is a logical compromise in that it is more difficult to establish its satisfaction than the universal morphism definitions, and has fewer immediate implications than the counit–unit definition. It is useful because of its obvious symmetry, and as a stepping-stone between the other definitions.

In order to interpret formula_113 as a &quot;natural isomorphism&quot;, one must recognize formula_114 and formula_115 as functors. In fact, they are both bifunctors from formula_116 to formula_117 (the category of sets). For details, see the article on hom functors. Spelled out, the naturality of formula_113 means that for all morphisms formula_119 in formula_1 and all morphisms formula_121 in formula_2 the following diagram commutes:

The vertical arrows in this diagram are those induced by composition. Formally, formula_123 is given by formula_124 for each formula_125 formula_126 is similar.

===Definition via counit–unit===

A third way of defining an adjunction between two categories formula_1 and formula_2 consists of two functors formula_103 and formula_104 and two natural transformations
:formula_131
respectively called the counit and the unit of the adjunction (terminology from universal algebra), such that the compositions
:formula_132
:formula_133
are the identity morphisms formula_134 and formula_135 on formula_20 and formula_21 respectively.

In this situation we say that formula_20 is left adjoint to formula_21 and formula_21 is right adjoint to formula_20, and may indicate this relationship by writing  formula_142 , or, simply  formula_24 .

In equational form, the above conditions on formula_144 are the counit–unit equations
:formula_145
which imply that for each formula_146 and each formula_147
:formula_148.

Note that formula_149 denotes the identify functor on the category formula_150, formula_134 denotes the identity natural transformation from the functor formula_20 to itself, and formula_153 denotes the identity morphism of the object formula_154

These equations are useful in reducing proofs about adjoint functors to algebraic manipulations. They are sometimes called the &quot;triangle identities&quot;, or sometimes the &quot;zig-zag equations&quot; because of the appearance of the corresponding string diagrams. A way to remember them is to first write down the nonsensical equation formula_155 and then fill in either formula_20 or formula_21 in one of the two simple ways that make the compositions defined.

Note: The use of the prefix &quot;co&quot; in counit here is not consistent with the terminology of limits and colimits, because a colimit satisfies an &quot;initial&quot; property whereas the counit morphisms satisfy &quot;terminal&quot; properties, and dually for limit versus unit. The term &quot;unit&quot; here is borrowed from the theory of monads, where it looks like the insertion of the identity formula_158 into a monoid.

==History==

The idea of adjoint functors was introduced by Daniel Kan in 1958. Like many of the concepts in category theory, it was suggested by the needs of homological algebra, which was at the time devoted to computations. Those faced with giving tidy, systematic presentations of the subject would have noticed relations such as

:hom(&quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), &quot;Y&quot;) = hom(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;))

in the category of abelian groups, where &quot;F&quot; was the functor formula_159 (i.e. take the tensor product with &quot;A&quot;), and &quot;G&quot; was the functor hom(&quot;A&quot;,–) (this is now known as the tensor-hom adjunction).

The use of the &quot;equals&quot; sign is an abuse of notation; those two groups are not really identical but there is a way of identifying them that is &quot;natural&quot;. It can be seen to be natural on the basis, firstly, that these are two alternative descriptions of the bilinear mappings from &quot;X&quot; × &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;. That is, however, something particular to the case of tensor product. In category theory the &#x27;naturality&#x27; of the bijection is subsumed in the concept of a natural isomorphism.

==Examples ==
===Free groups===
The construction of free groups is a common and illuminating example.

Let &quot;F&quot; : Set → Grp be the functor assigning to each set &quot;Y&quot; the free group generated by the elements of &quot;Y&quot;, and let &quot;G&quot; : Grp → Set be the forgetful functor, which assigns to each group &quot;X&quot; its underlying set. Then &quot;F&quot; is left adjoint to &quot;G&quot;:

Initial morphisms. For each set &quot;Y&quot;, the set &quot;GFY&quot; is just the underlying set of the free group &quot;FY&quot; generated by &quot;Y&quot;. Let  formula_160  be the set map given by &quot;inclusion of generators&quot;. This is an initial morphism from &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;G&quot;, because any set map from &quot;Y&quot; to the underlying set &quot;GW&quot; of some group &quot;W&quot; will factor through  formula_160  via a unique group homomorphism from &quot;FY&quot; to &quot;W&quot;. This is precisely the universal property of the free group on &quot;Y&quot;.

Terminal morphisms. For each group &quot;X&quot;, the group &quot;FGX&quot; is the free group generated freely by &quot;GX&quot;, the elements of &quot;X&quot;. Let  formula_162  be the group homomorphism that sends the generators of &quot;FGX&quot; to the elements of &quot;X&quot; they correspond to, which exists by the universal property of free groups. Then each  formula_163  is a terminal morphism from &quot;F&quot; to &quot;X&quot;, because any group homomorphism from a free group &quot;FZ&quot; to &quot;X&quot; will factor through  formula_162  via a unique set map from &quot;Z&quot; to &quot;GX&quot;. This means that (&quot;F&quot;,&quot;G&quot;) is an adjoint pair.

Hom-set adjunction. Group homomorphisms from the free group &quot;FY&quot; to a group &quot;X&quot; correspond precisely to maps from the set &quot;Y&quot; to the set &quot;GX&quot;: each homomorphism from &quot;FY&quot; to &quot;X&quot; is fully determined by its action on generators, another restatement of the universal property of free groups. One can verify directly that this correspondence is a natural transformation, which means it is a hom-set adjunction for the pair (&quot;F&quot;,&quot;G&quot;).

counit–unit adjunction. One can also verify directly that ε and η are natural. Then, a direct verification that they form a counit–unit adjunction  formula_142  is as follows:

The first counit–unit equation  formula_166  says that for each set &quot;Y&quot; the composition
:formula_167
should be the identity. The intermediate group &quot;FGFY&quot; is the free group generated freely by the words of the free group &quot;FY&quot;. (Think of these words as placed in parentheses to indicate that they are independent generators.) The arrow  formula_168  is the group homomorphism from &quot;FY&quot; into &quot;FGFY&quot; sending each generator &quot;y&quot; of &quot;FY&quot; to the corresponding word of length one (&quot;y&quot;) as a generator of &quot;FGFY&quot;. The arrow  formula_169  is the group homomorphism from &quot;FGFY&quot; to &quot;FY&quot; sending each generator to the word of &quot;FY&quot; it corresponds to (so this map is &quot;dropping parentheses&quot;). The composition of these maps is indeed the identity on &quot;FY&quot;.

The second counit–unit equation  formula_170  says that for each group &quot;X&quot; the composition
: formula_171 
should be the identity. The intermediate set &quot;GFGX&quot; is just the underlying set of &quot;FGX&quot;. The arrow  formula_172  is the &quot;inclusion of generators&quot; set map from the set &quot;GX&quot; to the set &quot;GFGX&quot;. The arrow  formula_173  is the set map from &quot;GFGX&quot; to &quot;GX&quot;, which underlies the group homomorphism sending each generator of &quot;FGX&quot; to the element of &quot;X&quot; it corresponds to (&quot;dropping parentheses&quot;). The composition of these maps is indeed the identity on &quot;GX&quot;.

===Free constructions and forgetful functors===
Free objects are all examples of a left adjoint to a forgetful functor, which assigns to an algebraic object its underlying set. These algebraic free functors have generally the same description as in the detailed description of the free group situation above.

===Diagonal functors and limits===
Products, fibred products, equalizers, and kernels are all examples of the categorical notion of a limit. Any limit functor is right adjoint to a corresponding diagonal functor (provided the category has the type of limits in question), and the counit of the adjunction provides the defining maps from the limit object (i.e. from the diagonal functor on the limit, in the functor category). Below are some specific examples.

* Products Let Π : Grp2 → Grp be the functor that assigns to each pair (&quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X2&quot;) the product group &quot;X&quot;1×&quot;X&quot;2, and let Δ : Grp → Grp2 be the diagonal functor that assigns to every group &quot;X&quot; the pair (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;X&quot;) in the product category Grp2. The universal property of the product group shows that Π is right-adjoint to Δ. The counit of this adjunction is the defining pair of projection maps from &quot;X&quot;1×&quot;X&quot;2 to &quot;X&quot;1 and &quot;X&quot;2 which define the limit, and the unit is the &quot;diagonal inclusion&quot; of a group X into &quot;X&quot;×&quot;X&quot; (mapping x to (x,x)).

: The cartesian product of sets, the product of rings, the product of topological spaces etc. follow the same pattern; it can also be extended in a straightforward manner to more than just two factors. More generally, any type of limit is right adjoint to a diagonal functor.

* Kernels. Consider the category &quot;D&quot; of homomorphisms of abelian groups. If &quot;f&quot;1 : &quot;A&quot;1 → &quot;B&quot;1 and &quot;f&quot;2 : &quot;A&quot;2 → &quot;B&quot;2 are two objects of &quot;D&quot;, then a morphism from &quot;f&quot;1 to &quot;f&quot;2 is a pair (&quot;g&quot;&quot;A&quot;, &quot;g&quot;&quot;B&quot;) of morphisms such that &quot;g&quot;&quot;B&quot;&quot;f&quot;1 = &quot;f&quot;2&quot;g&quot;&quot;A&quot;. Let &quot;G&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → Ab be the functor which assigns to each homomorphism its kernel and let &quot;F&quot; : Ab → &quot;D&quot; be the functor which maps the group &quot;A&quot; to the homomorphism &quot;A&quot; → 0. Then &quot;G&quot; is right adjoint to &quot;F&quot;, which expresses the universal property of kernels. The counit of this adjunction is the defining embedding of a homomorphism&#x27;s kernel into the homomorphism&#x27;s domain, and the unit is the morphism identifying a group &quot;A&quot; with the kernel of the homomorphism &quot;A&quot; → 0.

: A suitable variation of this example also shows that the kernel functors for vector spaces and for modules are right adjoints. Analogously, one can show that the cokernel functors for abelian groups, vector spaces and modules are left adjoints.

===Colimits and diagonal functors===
Coproducts, fibred coproducts, coequalizers, and cokernels are all examples of the categorical notion of a colimit. Any colimit functor is left adjoint to a corresponding diagonal functor (provided the category has the type of colimits in question), and the unit of the adjunction provides the defining maps into the colimit object. Below are some specific examples.

* Coproducts. If &quot;F&quot; : Ab2 → Ab assigns to every pair (&quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2) of abelian groups their direct sum, and if &quot;G&quot; : Ab → Ab2 is the functor which assigns to every abelian group &quot;Y&quot; the pair (&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;), then &quot;F&quot; is left adjoint to &quot;G&quot;, again a consequence of the universal property of direct sums. The unit of this adjoint pair is the defining pair of inclusion maps from &quot;X&quot;1 and &quot;X&quot;2 into the direct sum, and the counit is the additive map from the direct sum of (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;X&quot;) to back to &quot;X&quot; (sending an element (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) of the direct sum to the element &quot;a&quot;+&quot;b&quot; of &quot;X&quot;).

: Analogous examples are given by the direct sum of vector spaces and modules, by the free product of groups and by the disjoint union of sets.

===Further examples===

==== Algebra ====
* Adjoining an identity to a rng. This example was discussed in the motivation section above. Given a rng &quot;R&quot;, a multiplicative identity element can be added by taking &quot;R&quot;xZ and defining a Z-bilinear product with (r,0)(0,1) = (0,1)(r,0) = (r,0), (r,0)(s,0) = (rs,0), (0,1)(0,1) = (0,1). This constructs a left adjoint to the functor taking a ring to the underlying rng.
* Adjoining an identity to a semigroup. Similarly, given a semigroup &quot;S&quot;, we can add an identity element and obtain a monoid by taking the disjoint union &quot;S&quot; formula_174 {1} and defining a binary operation on it such that it extends the operation on &quot;S&quot; and 1 is an identity element. This construction gives a functor that is a left adjoint to the functor taking a monoid to the underlying semigroup.
* Ring extensions. Suppose &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are rings, and ρ : &quot;R&quot; → &quot;S&quot; is a ring homomorphism. Then &quot;S&quot; can be seen as a (left) &quot;R&quot;-module, and the tensor product with &quot;S&quot; yields a functor &quot;F&quot; : &quot;R&quot;-Mod → &quot;S&quot;-Mod. Then &quot;F&quot; is left adjoint to the forgetful functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;S&quot;-Mod → &quot;R&quot;-Mod.
* Tensor products. If &quot;R&quot; is a ring and &quot;M&quot; is a right &quot;R&quot;-module, then the tensor product with &quot;M&quot; yields a functor &quot;F&quot; : &quot;R&quot;-Mod → Ab. The functor &quot;G&quot; : Ab → &quot;R&quot;-Mod, defined by &quot;G&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) = homZ(&quot;M&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) for every abelian group &quot;A&quot;, is a right adjoint to &quot;F&quot;.
* From monoids and groups to rings. The integral monoid ring construction gives a functor from monoids to rings. This functor is left adjoint to the functor that associates to a given ring its underlying multiplicative monoid. Similarly, the integral group ring construction yields a functor from groups to rings, left adjoint to the functor that assigns to a given ring its group of units. One can also start with a field &quot;K&quot; and consider the category of &quot;K&quot;-algebras instead of the category of rings, to get the monoid and group rings over &quot;K&quot;.
* Field of fractions. Consider the category Domm of integral domains with injective morphisms. The forgetful functor Field → Domm from fields has a left adjoint—it assigns to every integral domain its field of fractions.
* Polynomial rings. Let Ring* be the category of pointed commutative rings with unity (pairs (A,a) where A is a ring, a ∈ A and morphisms preserve the distinguished elements). The forgetful functor G:Ring* → Ring has a left adjoint – it assigns to every ring R the pair (R[x],x) where R[x] is the polynomial ring with coefficients from R.
* Abelianization. Consider the inclusion functor &quot;G&quot; : Ab → Grp from the category of abelian groups to category of groups. It has a left adjoint called abelianization which assigns to every group &quot;G&quot; the quotient group &quot;G&quot;ab=&quot;G&quot;/[&quot;G&quot;,&quot;G&quot;].
* The Grothendieck group. In K-theory, the point of departure is to observe that the category of vector bundles on a topological space has a commutative monoid structure under direct sum. One may make an abelian group out of this monoid, the Grothendieck group, by formally adding an additive inverse for each bundle (or equivalence class). Alternatively one can observe that the functor that for each group takes the underlying monoid (ignoring inverses) has a left adjoint. This is a once-for-all construction, in line with the third section discussion above. That is, one can imitate the construction of negative numbers; but there is the other option of an existence theorem. For the case of finitary algebraic structures, the existence by itself can be referred to universal algebra, or model theory; naturally there is also a proof adapted to category theory, too.
* Frobenius reciprocity in the representation theory of groups: see induced representation. This example foreshadowed the general theory by about half a century.

====Topology====
* A functor with a left and a right adjoint. Let &quot;G&quot; be the functor from topological spaces to sets that associates to every topological space its underlying set (forgetting the topology, that is). &quot;G&quot; has a left adjoint &quot;F&quot;, creating the discrete space on a set &quot;Y&quot;, and a right adjoint &quot;H&quot; creating the trivial topology on &quot;Y&quot;.
* Suspensions and loop spaces. Given topological spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, the space [&quot;SX&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;] of homotopy classes of maps from the suspension &quot;SX&quot; of &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; is naturally isomorphic to the space [&quot;X&quot;, Ω&quot;Y&quot;] of homotopy classes of maps from &quot;X&quot; to the loop space Ω&quot;Y&quot; of &quot;Y&quot;. The suspension functor is therefore left adjoint to the loop space functor in the homotopy category, an important fact in homotopy theory.
* Stone–Čech compactification. Let KHaus be the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and &quot;G&quot; : KHaus → Top be the inclusion functor to the category of topological spaces. Then &quot;G&quot; has a left adjoint &quot;F&quot; : Top → KHaus, the Stone–Čech compactification. The unit of this adjoint pair yields a continuous map from every topological space &quot;X&quot; into its Stone–Čech compactification. 
* Direct and inverse images of sheaves. Every continuous map &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; between topological spaces induces a functor &quot;f&quot; ∗ from the category of sheaves (of sets, or abelian groups, or rings...) on &quot;X&quot; to the corresponding category of sheaves on &quot;Y&quot;, the &quot;direct image functor&quot;. It also induces a functor &quot;f&quot; −1 from the category of sheaves of abelian groups on &quot;Y&quot; to the category of sheaves of abelian groups on &quot;X&quot;, the &quot;inverse image functor&quot;. &quot;f&quot; −1 is left adjoint to &quot;f&quot; ∗. Here a more subtle point is that the left adjoint for coherent sheaves will differ from that for sheaves (of sets).
* Soberification. The article on Stone duality describes an adjunction between the category of topological spaces and the category of sober spaces that is known as soberification. Notably, the article also contains a detailed description of another adjunction that prepares the way for the famous duality of sober spaces and spatial locales, exploited in pointless topology.

====Posets====
Every partially ordered set can be viewed as a category (where the elements of the poset become the category&#x27;s objects and we have a single morphism from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;). A pair of adjoint functors between two partially ordered sets is called a Galois connection (or, if it is contravariant, an &quot;antitone&quot; Galois connection). See that article for a number of examples: the case of Galois theory of course is a leading one. Any Galois connection gives rise to closure operators and to inverse order-preserving bijections between the corresponding closed elements.

As is the case for Galois groups, the real interest lies often in refining a correspondence to a duality (i.e. &quot;antitone&quot; order isomorphism). A treatment of Galois theory along these lines by Kaplansky was influential in the recognition of the general structure here.

The partial order case collapses the adjunction definitions quite noticeably, but can provide several themes:
* adjunctions may not be dualities or isomorphisms, but are candidates for upgrading to that status
* closure operators may indicate the presence of adjunctions, as corresponding monads (cf. the Kuratowski closure axioms)
* a very general comment of William Lawvere is that &quot;syntax and semantics&quot; are adjoint: take &quot;C&quot; to be the set of all logical theories (axiomatizations), and &quot;D&quot; the power set of the set of all mathematical structures. For a theory &quot;T&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, let &quot;G&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) be the set of all structures that satisfy the axioms &quot;T&quot;; for a set of mathematical structures &quot;S&quot;, let &quot;F&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) be the minimal axiomatization of &quot;S&quot;. We can then say that &quot;S&quot; is a subset of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) if and only if &quot;F&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) logically implies &quot;T&quot;: the &quot;semantics functor&quot; &quot;G&quot; is right adjoint to the &quot;syntax functor&quot; &quot;F&quot;.
* division is (in general) the attempt to &quot;invert&quot; multiplication, but in situations where this is not possible, we often attempt to construct an &quot;adjoint&quot; instead: the ideal quotient is adjoint to the multiplication by ring ideals, and the implication in propositional logic is adjoint to logical conjunction.

====Category theory====
* Equivalences. If &quot;F&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot; is an equivalence of categories, then we have an inverse equivalence &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot;, and the two functors &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; form an adjoint pair. The unit and counit are natural isomorphisms in this case.
* A series of adjunctions. The functor π0 which assigns to a category its set of connected components is left-adjoint to the functor &quot;D&quot; which assigns to a set the discrete category on that set. Moreover, &quot;D&quot; is left-adjoint to the object functor &quot;U&quot; which assigns to each category its set of objects, and finally &quot;U&quot; is left-adjoint to &quot;A&quot; which assigns to each set the indiscrete category on that set.
* Exponential object. In a cartesian closed category the endofunctor &quot;C&quot; → &quot;C&quot; given by –×&quot;A&quot; has a right adjoint –&quot;A&quot;. This pair is often referred to as currying and uncurrying; in many special cases, they are also continuous and form a homeomorphism.
====Categorical logic====
* Quantification. If formula_175 is a unary predicate expressing some property, then a sufficiently strong set theory may prove the existence of the set formula_176 of terms that fulfill the property. A proper subset formula_177 and the associated injection of formula_50 into formula_63 is characterized by a predicate formula_180 expressing a strictly more restrictive property. 
:The role of quantifiers in predicate logics is in forming propositions and also in expressing sophisticated predicates by closing formulas with possibly more variables. For example, consider a predicate formula_181 with two open variables of sort formula_54 and formula_63. Using a quantifier to close formula_54, we can form the set
::formula_185
:of all elements formula_186 of formula_63 for which there is an formula_188 to which it is formula_181-related, and which itself is characterized by the property formula_190. Set theoretic operations like the intersection formula_191 of two sets directly corresponds to the conjunction formula_192 of predicates. In categorical logic, a subfield of topos theory, quantifiers are identified with adjoints to the pullback functor. Such a realization can be seen in analogy to the discussion of propositional logic using set theory but the general definition make for a richer range of logics.

:So consider an object formula_63 in a category with pullbacks. Any morphism formula_194 induces a functor 
::formula_195 
:on the category that is the preorder of subobjects. It maps subobjects formula_50 of formula_63 (technically: monomorphism classes of formula_198) to the pullback formula_199. If this functor has a left- or right adjoint, they are called formula_200 and formula_201, respectively. They both map from formula_202 back to formula_203. Very roughly, given a domain formula_204 to quantify a relation expressed via formula_33 over, the functor/quantifier closes formula_54 in formula_199 and returns the thereby specified subset of formula_63.

: Example: In formula_209, the category of sets and functions, the canonical subobjects are the subset (or rather their canonical injections). The pullback formula_210 of an injection of a subset formula_50 into formula_63 along formula_33 is characterized as the largest set which knows all about formula_33 and the injection of formula_50 into formula_63. It therefore turns out to be (in bijection with) the inverse image formula_217.
:For formula_218, let us figure out the left adjoint, which is defined via
::formula_219
:which here just means
::formula_220.

:Consider formula_221. We see formula_222. Conversely, If for an formula_223 we also have formula_224, then clearly formula_225. So formula_226 implies formula_221. We conclude that left adjoint to the inverse image functor formula_228 is given by the direct image. Here is a characterization of this result, which matches more the logical interpretation: The image of formula_229 under formula_230 is the full set of formula_186&#x27;s, such that formula_232 is non-empty. This works because it neglects exactly those formula_233 which are in the complement of formula_234. So
::formula_235
:Put this in analogy to our motivation formula_236.
:The right adjoint to the inverse image functor is given (without doing the computation here) by
::formula_237
: The subset formula_238 of formula_63 is characterized as the full set of formula_186&#x27;s with the property that the inverse image of formula_241 with respect to formula_33 is fully contained within formula_229. Note how the predicate determining the set is the same as above, except that formula_244 is replaced by formula_245.

==== Probability ====
The twin fact in probability can be understood as an adjunction: that expectation commutes with affine transform, and that the expectation is in some sense the best &quot;solution&quot; to the problem of finding a real-valued approximation to a distribution on the real numbers.

Define a category based on formula_246, with objects being the real numbers, and the morphisms being &quot;affine functions evaluated at a point&quot;. That is, for any affine function formula_247 and any real number formula_248, define a morphism formula_249.

Define a category based on formula_250, the set of probability distribution on formula_246 with finite expectation. Define morphisms on formula_250 as &quot;affine functions evaluated at a distribution&quot;. That is, for any affine function formula_247 and any formula_254, define a morphism formula_255.

Then, the Dirac delta measure defines a functor: formula_256, and the expectation defines another functor formula_257, and they are adjoint: formula_258. (Somewhat disconcertingly, formula_259 is the left adjoint, even though formula_259 is &quot;forgetful&quot; and formula_261 is &quot;free&quot;.)

==Adjunctions in full==

There are hence numerous functors and natural transformations associated with every adjunction, and only a small portion is sufficient to determine the rest.

An &quot;adjunction&quot; between categories &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; consists of
*A functor &quot;F&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot; called the left adjoint
*A functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; called the right adjoint
*A natural isomorphism Φ : hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;F&quot;–,–) → hom&quot;D&quot;(–,&quot;G&quot;–)
*A natural transformation ε : &quot;FG&quot; → 1&quot;C&quot; called the counit
*A natural transformation η : 1&quot;D&quot; → &quot;GF&quot; called the unit

An equivalent formulation, where &quot;X&quot; denotes any object of &quot;C&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; denotes any object of &quot;D&quot;, is as follows:

::For every &quot;C&quot;-morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;FY&quot; → &quot;X&quot;, there is a unique &quot;D&quot;-morphism Φ&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;GX&quot; such that the diagrams below commute, and for every &quot;D&quot;-morphism &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;GX&quot;, there is a unique &quot;C&quot;-morphism Φ−1&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;X&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) = &quot;f&quot; : &quot;FY&quot; → &quot;X&quot; in &quot;C&quot; such that the diagrams below commute:

From this assertion, one can recover that:
*The transformations ε, η, and Φ are related by the equations
:formula_262
*The transformations ε, η satisfy the counit–unit equations
:formula_263
*Each pair (&quot;GX&quot;, ε&quot;X&quot;) is a terminal morphism from &quot;F&quot; to &quot;X&quot; in &quot;C&quot;
*Each pair (&quot;FY&quot;, η&quot;Y&quot;) is an initial morphism from &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;G&quot; in &quot;D&quot;

In particular, the equations above allow one to define Φ, ε, and η in terms of any one of the three. However, the adjoint functors &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; alone are in general not sufficient to determine the adjunction. The equivalence of these situations is demonstrated below.

===Universal morphisms induce hom-set adjunction===

Given a right adjoint functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot;; in the sense of initial morphisms, one may construct the induced hom-set adjunction by doing the following steps.

* Construct a functor &quot;F&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot; and a natural transformation η.
** For each object &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;D&quot;, choose an initial morphism (&quot;F&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;), η&quot;Y&quot;) from &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;G&quot;, so that η&quot;Y&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;G&quot;(&quot;F&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;)). We have the map of &quot;F&quot; on objects and the family of morphisms η.
** For each &quot;f&quot; : &quot;Y&quot;0 → &quot;Y&quot;1, as (&quot;F&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;0), η&quot;Y&quot;0) is an initial morphism, then factorize η&quot;Y&quot;1 &quot;f&quot; with η&quot;Y&quot;0 and get &quot;F&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) : &quot;F&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;0) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;1). This is the map of &quot;F&quot; on morphisms.
** The commuting diagram of that factorization implies the commuting diagram of natural transformations, so η : 1&quot;D&quot; → &quot;G&quot; &quot;F&quot; is a natural transformation.
** Uniqueness of that factorization and that &quot;G&quot; is a functor implies that the map of &quot;F&quot; on morphisms preserves compositions and identities.
* Construct a natural isomorphism Φ : hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;F&quot;-,-) → hom&quot;D&quot;(-,&quot;G&quot;-).
** For each object &quot;X&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, each object &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;D&quot;, as (&quot;F&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;), η&quot;Y&quot;) is an initial morphism, then Φ&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;X&quot; is a bijection, where Φ&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot; : &quot;F&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) → &quot;X&quot;) = &quot;G&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) η&quot;Y&quot;.
** η is a natural transformation, &quot;G&quot; is a functor, then for any objects &quot;X&quot;0, &quot;X&quot;1 in &quot;C&quot;, any objects &quot;Y&quot;0, &quot;Y&quot;1 in &quot;D&quot;, any &quot;x&quot; : &quot;X&quot;0 → &quot;X&quot;1, any &quot;y&quot; : &quot;Y&quot;1 → &quot;Y&quot;0, we have Φ&quot;Y&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;1(&quot;x&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;F&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)) = G(x) &quot;G&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) &quot;G&quot;(&quot;F&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)) η&quot;Y&quot;1 = &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &quot;G&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) η&quot;Y&quot;0 &quot;y&quot; = &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) Φ&quot;Y&quot;0, &quot;X&quot;0(&quot;f&quot;) &quot;y&quot;, and then Φ is natural in both arguments.

A similar argument allows one to construct a hom-set adjunction from the terminal morphisms to a left adjoint functor. (The construction that starts with a right adjoint is slightly more common, since the right adjoint in many adjoint pairs is a trivially defined inclusion or forgetful functor.)

===counit–unit adjunction induces hom-set adjunction===

Given functors &quot;F&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot;, &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot;, and a counit–unit adjunction (ε, η) : &quot;F&quot; formula_264 &quot;G&quot;, we can construct a hom-set adjunction by finding the natural transformation Φ : hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;F&quot;-,-) → hom&quot;D&quot;(-,&quot;G&quot;-) in the following steps:

*For each &quot;f&quot; : &quot;FY&quot; → &quot;X&quot; and each &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;GX&quot;, define
:formula_265
:The transformations Φ and Ψ are natural because η and ε are natural.

*Using, in order, that &quot;F&quot; is a functor, that ε is natural, and the counit–unit equation 1&quot;FY&quot; = ε&quot;FY&quot; &quot;F&quot;(η&quot;Y&quot;), we obtain
:formula_266
:hence ΨΦ is the identity transformation.

*Dually, using that &quot;G&quot; is a functor, that η is natural, and the counit–unit equation 1&quot;GX&quot; = &quot;G&quot;(ε&quot;X&quot;) η&quot;GX&quot;, we obtain
:formula_267
:hence ΦΨ is the identity transformation. Thus Φ is a natural isomorphism with inverse Φ−1 = Ψ.

===Hom-set adjunction induces all of the above===

Given functors &quot;F&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot;, &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot;, and a hom-set adjunction Φ : hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;F&quot;-,-) → hom&quot;D&quot;(-,&quot;G&quot;-), one can construct a counit–unit adjunction

:formula_142 ,

which defines families of initial and terminal morphisms, in the following steps:

*Let  formula_269  for each &quot;X&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, where  formula_270  is the identity morphism.
*Let  formula_271  for each &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;D&quot;, where  formula_272  is the identity morphism.
*The bijectivity and naturality of Φ imply that each (&quot;GX&quot;, ε&quot;X&quot;) is a terminal morphism from &quot;F&quot; to &quot;X&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, and each (&quot;FY&quot;, η&quot;Y&quot;) is an initial morphism from &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;G&quot; in &quot;D&quot;.
*The naturality of Φ implies the naturality of ε and η, and the two formulas
:formula_273
:for each &quot;f&quot;: &quot;FY&quot; → &quot;X&quot; and &quot;g&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;GX&quot; (which completely determine Φ).

*Substituting &quot;FY&quot; for &quot;X&quot; and η&quot;Y&quot; = Φ&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;FY&quot;(1&quot;FY&quot;) for &quot;g&quot; in the second formula gives the first counit–unit equation
:formula_274,
:and substituting &quot;GX&quot; for &quot;Y&quot; and εX = Φ−1&quot;GX, X&quot;(1&quot;GX&quot;) for &quot;f&quot; in the first formula gives the second counit–unit equation
:formula_275.

== Properties ==

===Existence===

Not every functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; admits a left adjoint. If &quot;C&quot; is a complete category, then the functors with left adjoints can be characterized by the adjoint functor theorem of Peter J. Freyd: &quot;G&quot; has a left adjoint if and only if it is continuous and a certain smallness condition is satisfied: for every object &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;D&quot; there exists a family of morphisms

:&quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;G&quot;(&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;)

where the indices &quot;i&quot; come from a &quot;set&quot; , not a &quot;proper class&quot;, such that every morphism

:&quot;h&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;G&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)

can be written as

:&quot;h&quot; = &quot;G&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) ∘ &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;

for some &quot;i&quot; in and some morphism

:&quot;t&quot; : &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; → &quot;X&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;.

An analogous statement characterizes those functors with a right adjoint.

An important special case is that of locally presentable categories. If formula_276 is a functor between locally presentable categories, then

* &quot;F&quot; has a right adjoint if and only if &quot;F&quot; preserves small colimits
* &quot;F&quot; has a left adjoint if and only if &quot;F&quot; preserves small limits and is an accessible functor

===Uniqueness===

If the functor &quot;F&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot; has two right adjoints &quot;G&quot; and &quot;G&quot;′, then &quot;G&quot; and &quot;G&quot;′ are naturally isomorphic. The same is true for left adjoints.

Conversely, if &quot;F&quot; is left adjoint to &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;G&quot; is naturally isomorphic to &quot;G&quot;′ then &quot;F&quot; is also left adjoint to &quot;G&quot;′. More generally, if 〈&quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, ε, η〉 is an adjunction (with counit–unit (ε,η)) and
:σ : &quot;F&quot; → &quot;F&quot;′
:τ : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot;′
are natural isomorphisms then 〈&quot;F&quot;′, &quot;G&quot;′, ε′, η′〉 is an adjunction where
:formula_277
Here formula_278 denotes vertical composition of natural transformations, and formula_279 denotes horizontal composition.

===Composition===

Adjunctions can be composed in a natural fashion. Specifically, if 〈&quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, ε, η〉 is an adjunction between &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; and 〈&quot;F&quot;′, &quot;G&quot;′, ε′, η′〉 is an adjunction between &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; then the functor
:formula_280
is left adjoint to
:formula_281
More precisely, there is an adjunction between &quot;F F&quot;&#x27; and &quot;G&#x27; G&quot; with unit and counit given respectively by the compositions:
:formula_282
This new adjunction is called the composition of the two given adjunctions.

Since there is also a natural way to define an identity adjunction between a category &quot;C&quot; and itself, one can then form a category whose objects are all small categories and whose morphisms are adjunctions.

===Limit preservation===

The most important property of adjoints is their continuity: every functor that has a left adjoint (and therefore &quot;is&quot; a right adjoint) is &quot;continuous&quot; (i.e. commutes with limits in the category theoretical sense); every functor that has a right adjoint (and therefore &quot;is&quot; a left adjoint) is &quot;cocontinuous&quot; (i.e. commutes with colimits).

Since many common constructions in mathematics are limits or colimits, this provides a wealth of information. For example:
* applying a right adjoint functor to a product of objects yields the product of the images;
* applying a left adjoint functor to a coproduct of objects yields the coproduct of the images;
* every right adjoint functor between two abelian categories is left exact;
* every left adjoint functor between two abelian categories is right exact.

===Additivity===

If &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are preadditive categories and &quot;F&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot; is an additive functor with a right adjoint &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; is also an additive functor and the hom-set bijections

:formula_283
are, in fact, isomorphisms of abelian groups. Dually, if &quot;G&quot; is additive with a left adjoint &quot;F&quot;, then &quot;F&quot; is also additive.

Moreover, if both &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are additive categories (i.e. preadditive categories with all finite biproducts), then any pair of adjoint functors between them are automatically additive.

==Relationships==

===Universal constructions===

As stated earlier, an adjunction between categories &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; gives rise to a family of universal morphisms, one for each object in &quot;C&quot; and one for each object in &quot;D&quot;. Conversely, if there exists a universal morphism to a functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; from every object of &quot;D&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; has a left adjoint.

However, universal constructions are more general than adjoint functors: a universal construction is like an optimization problem; it gives rise to an adjoint pair if and only if this problem has a solution for every object of &quot;D&quot; (equivalently, every object of &quot;C&quot;).

===Equivalences of categories===

If a functor &quot;F&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot; is one half of an equivalence of categories then it is the left adjoint in an adjoint equivalence of categories, i.e. an adjunction whose unit and counit are isomorphisms.

Every adjunction 〈&quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, ε, η〉 extends an equivalence of certain subcategories. Define &quot;C&quot;1 as the full subcategory of &quot;C&quot; consisting of those objects &quot;X&quot; of &quot;C&quot; for which ε&quot;X&quot; is an isomorphism, and define &quot;D&quot;1 as the full subcategory of &quot;D&quot; consisting of those objects &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;D&quot; for which η&quot;Y&quot; is an isomorphism. Then &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; can be restricted to &quot;D&quot;1 and &quot;C&quot;1 and yield inverse equivalences of these subcategories.

In a sense, then, adjoints are &quot;generalized&quot; inverses. Note however that a right inverse of &quot;F&quot; (i.e. a functor &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;FG&quot; is naturally isomorphic to 1&quot;D&quot;) need not be a right (or left) adjoint of &quot;F&quot;. Adjoints generalize &quot;two-sided&quot; inverses.

===Monads===

Every adjunction 〈&quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, ε, η〉 gives rise to an associated monad 〈&quot;T&quot;, η, μ〉 in the category &quot;D&quot;. The functor
:formula_284
is given by &quot;T&quot; = &quot;GF&quot;. The unit of the monad
:formula_285
is just the unit η of the adjunction and the multiplication transformation
:formula_286
is given by μ = &quot;G&quot;ε&quot;F&quot;. Dually, the triple 〈&quot;FG&quot;, ε, &quot;F&quot;η&quot;G&quot;〉 defines a comonad in &quot;C&quot;.

Every monad arises from some adjunction—in fact, typically from many adjunctions—in the above fashion. Two constructions, called the category of Eilenberg–Moore algebras and the Kleisli category are two extremal solutions to the problem of constructing an adjunction that gives rise to a given monad.

<text>In mathematics, specifically in the field of finite group theory, the Sylow theorems are a collection of theorems named after the Norwegian mathematician Peter Ludwig Sylow that give detailed information about the number of subgroups of fixed order that a given finite group contains. The Sylow theorems form a fundamental part of finite group theory and have very important applications in the classification of finite simple groups.

For a prime number formula_1, a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup (sometimes &quot;p&quot;-Sylow subgroup) of a finite group formula_2 is a maximal formula_1-subgroup of formula_2, i.e., a subgroup of formula_2 that is a &quot;p&quot;-group (meaning its cardinality is a power of formula_6 or equivalently: For each group element, its order is some power of formula_1) that is not a proper subgroup of any other formula_1-subgroup of formula_2. The set of all Sylow formula_1-subgroups for a given prime formula_1 is sometimes written formula_12.

The Sylow theorems assert a partial converse to Lagrange&#x27;s theorem. Lagrange&#x27;s theorem states that for any finite group formula_2 the order (number of elements) of every subgroup of formula_2 divides the order of formula_2. The Sylow theorems state that for every prime factor &quot;formula_1&quot; of the order of a finite group formula_2, there exists a Sylow formula_1-subgroup of formula_2 of order formula_20, the highest power of formula_1 that divides the order of formula_2. Moreover, every subgroup of order &quot;formula_20&quot; is a Sylow &quot;formula_1&quot;-subgroup of formula_2, and the Sylow formula_1-subgroups of a group (for a given prime formula_1) are conjugate to each other. Furthermore, the number of Sylow formula_1-subgroups of a group for a given prime formula_1 is congruent to 1 (mod formula_1).

== Theorems ==
=== Motivation ===
The Sylow theorems are a powerful statement about the structure of groups in general, but are also powerful in applications of finite group theory. This is because they give a method for using the prime decomposition of the cardinality of a finite group formula_2 to give statements about the structure of its subgroups: essentially, it gives a technique to transport basic number-theoretic information about a group to its group structure. From this observation, classifying finite groups becomes a game of finding which combinations/constructions of groups of smaller order can be applied to construct a group. For example, a typical application of these theorems is in the classification of finite groups of some fixed cardinality, e.g. formula_32.

=== Statement ===
Collections of subgroups that are each maximal in one sense or another are common in group theory. The surprising result here is that in the case of formula_33, all members are actually isomorphic to each other and have the largest possible order: if formula_34 with formula_35 where does not divide , then every Sylow -subgroup has order formula_36. That is, is a -group and formula_37. These properties can be exploited to further analyze the structure of .

The following theorems were first proposed and proven by Ludwig Sylow in 1872, and published in &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot;.

The following weaker version of theorem 1 was first proved by Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and is known as Cauchy&#x27;s theorem.



=== Consequences ===
The Sylow theorems imply that for a prime number formula_1 every Sylow formula_1-subgroup is of the same order, formula_20. Conversely, if a subgroup has order formula_20, then it is a Sylow formula_1-subgroup, and so is conjugate to every other Sylow formula_1-subgroup. Due to the maximality condition, if formula_44 is any formula_1-subgroup of formula_2, then formula_44 is a subgroup of a formula_1-subgroup of order formula_20.

An important consequence of Theorem 2 is that the condition formula_50 is equivalent to the condition that the Sylow formula_1-subgroup of formula_2 is a normal subgroup (Theorem 3 can often show formula_50). However, there are groups that have proper, non-trivial normal subgroups but no normal Sylow subgroups, such as formula_54. Groups that are of prime-power order have no proper Sylow formula_1-subgroups.

The third bullet point of the third theorem has as an immediate consequence that formula_56 divides formula_57.

=== Sylow theorems for infinite groups ===
There is an analogue of the Sylow theorems for infinite groups. One defines a Sylow -subgroup in an infinite group to be a &quot;p&quot;-subgroup (that is, every element in it has -power order) that is maximal for inclusion among all -subgroups in the group. Let formula_58 denote the set of conjugates of a subgroup formula_59.

== Examples ==
A simple illustration of Sylow subgroups and the Sylow theorems are the dihedral group of the &quot;n&quot;-gon, &quot;D&quot;2&quot;n&quot;. For &quot;n&quot; odd, 2 = 21 is the highest power of 2 dividing the order, and thus subgroups of order 2 are Sylow subgroups. These are the groups generated by a reflection, of which there are &quot;n&quot;, and they are all conjugate under rotations; geometrically the axes of symmetry pass through a vertex and a side.
By contrast, if &quot;n&quot; is even, then 4 divides the order of the group, and the subgroups of order 2 are no longer Sylow subgroups, and in fact they fall into two conjugacy classes, geometrically according to whether they pass through two vertices or two faces. These are related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation through π/&quot;n&quot;, half the minimal rotation in the dihedral group.
Another example are the Sylow p-subgroups of &quot;GL&quot;2(&quot;F&quot;&quot;q&quot;), where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are primes ≥ 3 and , which are all abelian. The order of &quot;GL&quot;2(&quot;F&quot;&quot;q&quot;) is . Since , the order of . Thus by Theorem 1, the order of the Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroups is &quot;p&quot;2&quot;n&quot;.

One such subgroup &quot;P&quot;, is the set of diagonal matrices formula_60, &quot;x&quot; is any primitive root of &quot;F&quot;&quot;q&quot;. Since the order of &quot;F&quot;&quot;q&quot; is , its primitive roots have order &quot;q&quot; − 1, which implies that or &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot; and all its powers have an order which is a power of &quot;p&quot;. So, &quot;P&quot; is a subgroup where all its elements have orders which are powers of &quot;p&quot;. There are &quot;pn&quot; choices for both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, making . This means &quot;P&quot; is a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup, which is abelian, as all diagonal matrices commute, and because Theorem 2 states that all Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroups are conjugate to each other, the Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroups of &quot;GL&quot;2(&quot;F&quot;&quot;q&quot;) are all abelian.

==Example applications==
Since Sylow&#x27;s theorem ensures the existence of p-subgroups of a finite group, it&#x27;s worthwhile to study groups of prime power order more closely. Most of the examples use Sylow&#x27;s theorem to prove that a group of a particular order is not simple. For groups of small order, the congruence condition of Sylow&#x27;s theorem is often sufficient to force the existence of a normal subgroup. 
;Example-1: Groups of order &quot;pq&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; primes with &quot;p&quot; &lt; &quot;q&quot;. 
;Example-2: Group of order 30, groups of order 20, groups of order &quot;p&quot;2&quot;q&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; distinct primes are some of the applications. 
;Example-3: (Groups of order 60): If the order |&quot;G&quot;| = 60 and &quot;G&quot; has more than one Sylow 5-subgroup, then &quot;G&quot; is simple.

=== Cyclic group orders ===
Some non-prime numbers &quot;n&quot; are such that every group of order &quot;n&quot; is cyclic. One can show that &quot;n&quot; = 15 is such a number using the Sylow theorems: Let &quot;G&quot; be a group of order 15 = 3 · 5 and &quot;n&quot;3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. Then &quot;n&quot;3 formula_61 5 and &quot;n&quot;3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only value satisfying these constraints is 1; therefore, there is only one subgroup of order 3, and it must be normal (since it has no distinct conjugates). Similarly, &quot;n&quot;5 must divide 3, and &quot;n&quot;5 must equal 1 (mod 5); thus it must also have a single normal subgroup of order 5. Since 3 and 5 are coprime, the intersection of these two subgroups is trivial, and so &quot;G&quot; must be the internal direct product of groups of order 3 and 5, that is the cyclic group of order 15. Thus, there is only one group of order 15 (up to isomorphism).

=== Small groups are not simple ===
A more complex example involves the order of the smallest simple group that is not cyclic. Burnside&#x27;s &quot;pa qb&quot; theorem states that if the order of a group is the product of one or two prime powers, then it is solvable, and so the group is not simple, or is of prime order and is cyclic. This rules out every group up to order 30 .

If &quot;G&quot; is simple, and |&quot;G&quot;| = 30, then &quot;n&quot;3 must divide 10 ( = 2 · 5), and &quot;n&quot;3 must equal 1 (mod 3). Therefore, &quot;n&quot;3 = 10, since neither 4 nor 7 divides 10, and if &quot;n&quot;3 = 1 then, as above, &quot;G&quot; would have a normal subgroup of order 3, and could not be simple. &quot;G&quot; then has 10 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 3, each of which has 2 elements of order 3 (plus the identity). This means &quot;G&quot; has at least 20 distinct elements of order 3.

As well, &quot;n&quot;5 = 6, since &quot;n&quot;5 must divide 6 ( = 2 · 3), and &quot;n&quot;5 must equal 1 (mod 5). So &quot;G&quot; also has 24 distinct elements of order 5. But the order of &quot;G&quot; is only 30, so a simple group of order 30 cannot exist.

Next, suppose |&quot;G&quot;| = 42 = 2 · 3 · 7. Here &quot;n&quot;7 must divide 6 ( = 2 · 3) and &quot;n&quot;7 must equal 1 (mod 7), so &quot;n&quot;7 = 1. So, as before, &quot;G&quot; can not be simple.

On the other hand, for |&quot;G&quot;| = 60 = 22 · 3 · 5, then &quot;n&quot;3 = 10 and &quot;n&quot;5 = 6 is perfectly possible. And in fact, the smallest simple non-cyclic group is &quot;A&quot;5, the alternating group over 5 elements. It has order 60, and has 24 cyclic permutations of order 5, and 20 of order 3.

=== Wilson&#x27;s theorem ===
Part of Wilson&#x27;s theorem states that

:formula_62

for every prime &quot;p&quot;. One may easily prove this theorem by Sylow&#x27;s third theorem. Indeed, 
observe that the number &quot;np&quot; of Sylow&#x27;s &quot;p&quot;-subgroups 
in the symmetric group &quot;Sp&quot; is times the number of p-cycles in &quot;Sp&quot;, ie. . On the other hand, . Hence, . So, .

=== Fusion results ===
Frattini&#x27;s argument shows that a Sylow subgroup of a normal subgroup provides a factorization of a finite group. A slight generalization known as Burnside&#x27;s fusion theorem states that if &quot;G&quot; is a finite group with Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup &quot;P&quot; and two subsets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; normalized by &quot;P&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are &quot;G&quot;-conjugate if and only if they are &quot;NG&quot;(&quot;P&quot;)-conjugate. The proof is a simple application of Sylow&#x27;s theorem: If &quot;B&quot;=&quot;Ag&quot;, then the normalizer of &quot;B&quot; contains not only &quot;P&quot; but also &quot;Pg&quot; (since &quot;Pg&quot; is contained in the normalizer of &quot;Ag&quot;). By Sylow&#x27;s theorem &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Pg&quot; are conjugate not only in &quot;G&quot;, but in the normalizer of &quot;B&quot;. Hence &quot;gh&quot;−1 normalizes &quot;P&quot; for some &quot;h&quot; that normalizes &quot;B&quot;, and then &quot;A&quot;&quot;gh&quot;−1 = &quot;B&quot;h−1 = &quot;B&quot;, so that &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are &quot;NG&quot;(&quot;P&quot;)-conjugate. Burnside&#x27;s fusion theorem can be used to give a more powerful factorization called a semidirect product: if &quot;G&quot; is a finite group whose Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup &quot;P&quot; is contained in the center of its normalizer, then &quot;G&quot; has a normal subgroup &quot;K&quot; of order coprime to &quot;P&quot;, &quot;G&quot; = &quot;PK&quot; and &quot;P&quot;∩&quot;K&quot; = {1}, that is, &quot;G&quot; is &quot;p&quot;-nilpotent.

Less trivial applications of the Sylow theorems include the focal subgroup theorem, which studies the control a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup of the derived subgroup has on the structure of the entire group. This control is exploited at several stages of the classification of finite simple groups, and for instance defines the case divisions used in the Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem classifying finite simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroup is a quasi-dihedral group. These rely on J. L. Alperin&#x27;s strengthening of the conjugacy portion of Sylow&#x27;s theorem to control what sorts of elements are used in the conjugation.

==Proof of the Sylow theorems==
The Sylow theorems have been proved in a number of ways, and the history of the proofs themselves is the subject of many papers, including Waterhouse, Scharlau, Casadio and Zappa, Gow, and to some extent Meo.

One proof of the Sylow theorems exploits the notion of group action in various creative ways. The group acts on itself or on the set of its &quot;p&quot;-subgroups in various ways, and each such action can be exploited to prove one of the Sylow theorems. The following proofs are based on combinatorial arguments of Wielandt. In the following, we use formula_63 as notation for &quot;a divides b&quot; and formula_64 for the negation of this statement.

{p^{k - \nu_p(j)} - j/p^{\nu_p(j)}} &lt;/math&gt;

and no power of &quot;p&quot; remains in any of the factors inside the product on the right. Hence , completing the proof.

It may be noted that conversely every subgroup &quot;H&quot; of order &quot;pk&quot; gives rise to sets for which = &quot;H&quot;, namely any one of the &quot;m&quot; distinct cosets &quot;Hg&quot;.}}





== Algorithms ==
The problem of finding a Sylow subgroup of a given group is an important problem in computational group theory.

One proof of the existence of Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroups is constructive: if &quot;H&quot; is a &quot;p&quot;-subgroup of &quot;G&quot; and the index [&quot;G&quot;:&quot;H&quot;] is divisible by &quot;p&quot;, then the normalizer &quot;N&quot; = &quot;NG&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) of &quot;H&quot; in &quot;G&quot; is also such that [&quot;N&quot; : &quot;H&quot;] is divisible by &quot;p&quot;. In other words, a polycyclic generating system of a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup can be found by starting from any &quot;p&quot;-subgroup &quot;H&quot; (including the identity) and taking elements of &quot;p&quot;-power order contained in the normalizer of &quot;H&quot; but not in &quot;H&quot; itself. The algorithmic version of this (and many improvements) is described in textbook form in Butler, including the algorithm described in Cannon. These versions are still used in the GAP computer algebra system.

In permutation groups, it has been proven, in Kantor and Kantor and Taylor, that a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup and its normalizer can be found in polynomial time of the input (the degree of the group times the number of generators). These algorithms are described in textbook form in Seress, and are now becoming practical as the constructive recognition of finite simple groups becomes a reality. In particular, versions of this algorithm are used in the Magma computer algebra system.

<text>Biophysics is an interdisciplinary science that applies approaches and methods traditionally used in physics to study biological phenomena. Biophysics covers all scales of biological organization, from molecular to organismic and populations. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, molecular biology, physical chemistry, physiology, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology, biomechanics, developmental biology and systems biology.

The term &quot;biophysics&quot; was originally introduced by Karl Pearson in 1892. The term &quot;biophysics&quot; is also regularly used in academia to indicate the study of the physical quantities (e.g. electric current, temperature, stress, entropy) in biological systems. Other biological sciences also perform research on the biophysical properties of living organisms including molecular biology, cell biology, chemical biology, and biochemistry.

==Overview==
Molecular biophysics typically addresses biological questions similar to those in biochemistry and molecular biology, seeking to find the physical underpinnings of biomolecular phenomena. Scientists in this field conduct research concerned with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA and protein biosynthesis, as well as how these interactions are regulated. A great variety of techniques are used to answer these questions.

Fluorescent imaging techniques, as well as electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and small-angle scattering (SAS) both with X-rays and neutrons (SAXS/SANS) are often used to visualize structures of biological significance. Protein dynamics can be observed by neutron spin echo spectroscopy. Conformational change in structure can be measured using techniques such as dual polarisation interferometry, circular dichroism, SAXS and SANS. Direct manipulation of molecules using optical tweezers or AFM, can also be used to monitor biological events where forces and distances are at the nanoscale. Molecular biophysicists often consider complex biological events as systems of interacting entities which can be understood e.g. through statistical mechanics, thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. By drawing knowledge and experimental techniques from a wide variety of disciplines, biophysicists are often able to directly observe, model or even manipulate the structures and interactions of individual molecules or complexes of molecules.

In addition to traditional (i.e. molecular and cellular) biophysical topics like structural biology or enzyme kinetics, modern biophysics encompasses an extraordinarily broad range of research, from bioelectronics to quantum biology involving both experimental and theoretical tools. It is becoming increasingly common for biophysicists to apply the models and experimental techniques derived from physics, as well as mathematics and statistics, to larger systems such as tissues, organs, populations and ecosystems. Biophysical models are used extensively in the study of electrical conduction in single neurons, as well as neural circuit analysis in both tissue and whole brain.

Medical physics, a branch of biophysics, is any application of physics to medicine or healthcare, ranging from radiology to microscopy and nanomedicine. For example, physicist Richard Feynman theorized about the future of nanomedicine. He wrote about the idea of a &quot;medical&quot; use for biological machines (see nanomachines). Feynman and Albert Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would be possible to (as Feynman put it) &quot;swallow the doctor&quot;. The idea was discussed in Feynman&#x27;s 1959 essay &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.

== History ==

The studies of Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) laid groundwork for the later field of biophysics. Some of the earlier studies in biophysics were conducted in the 1840s by a group known as the Berlin school of physiologists. Among its members were pioneers such as Hermann von Helmholtz, Ernst Heinrich Weber, Carl F. W. Ludwig, and Johannes Peter Müller. 

William T. Bovie (1882–1958) is credited as a leader of the field&#x27;s further development in the mid-20th century. He was a leader in developing electrosurgery.

The popularity of the field rose when the book &quot;What Is Life?&quot; by Erwin Schrödinger was published. Since 1957, biophysicists have organized themselves into the Biophysical Society which now has about 9,000 members over the world.

Some authors such as Robert Rosen criticize biophysics on the ground that the biophysical method does not take into account the specificity of biological phenomena.

==Focus as a subfield==
While some colleges and universities have dedicated departments of biophysics, usually at the graduate level, many do not have university-level biophysics departments, instead having groups in related departments such as biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, medicine, molecular biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, physics, and physiology. Depending on the strengths of a department at a university differing emphasis will be given to fields of biophysics. What follows is a list of examples of how each department applies its efforts toward the study of biophysics. This list is hardly all inclusive. Nor does each subject of study belong exclusively to any particular department. Each academic institution makes its own rules and there is much overlap between departments.

*Biology and molecular biology – Gene regulation, single protein dynamics, bioenergetics, patch clamping, biomechanics, virophysics.
*Structural biology – Ångstrom-resolution structures of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and complexes thereof.
*Biochemistry and chemistry – biomolecular structure, siRNA, nucleic acid structure, structure-activity relationships.
*Computer science – Neural networks, biomolecular and drug databases.
*Computational chemistry – molecular dynamics simulation, molecular docking, quantum chemistry
*Bioinformatics – sequence alignment, structural alignment, protein structure prediction
*Mathematics – graph/network theory, population modeling, dynamical systems, phylogenetics.
*Medicine – biophysical research that emphasizes medicine. Medical biophysics is a field closely related to physiology. It explains various aspects and systems of the body from a physical and mathematical perspective. Examples are fluid dynamics of blood flow, gas physics of respiration, radiation in diagnostics/treatment and much more. Biophysics is taught as a preclinical subject in many medical schools, mainly in Europe.
* Neuroscience – studying neural networks experimentally (brain slicing) as well as theoretically (computer models), membrane permittivity.
*Pharmacology and physiology – channelomics, electrophysiology, biomolecular interactions, cellular membranes, polyketides.
*Physics – negentropy, stochastic processes, and the development of new physical techniques and instrumentation as well as their application.
*Quantum biology – The field of quantum biology applies quantum mechanics to biological objects and problems. Decohered isomers to yield time-dependent base substitutions. These studies imply applications in quantum computing.
*Agronomy and agriculture
Many biophysical techniques are unique to this field. Research efforts in biophysics are often initiated by scientists who were biologists, chemists or physicists by training.

<text>The Comanche or Nʉmʉnʉʉ (, &quot;the people&quot;) is a Native American tribe from the Southern Plains of the present-day United States. Comanche people today belong to the federally recognized Comanche Nation, headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma.

The Comanche language is a Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan family. Originally, it was a Shoshoni dialect, but diverged and became a separate language. The Comanche were once part of the Shoshone people of the Great Basin.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Comanche lived in most of present-day northwestern Texas and adjacent areas in eastern New Mexico, southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and western Oklahoma. Spanish colonists and later Mexicans called their historical territory &quot;Comanchería&quot;.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, Comanche practiced a nomadic horse culture and hunted, particularly bison. They traded with neighboring Native American peoples, and Spanish, French, and American colonists and settlers.

As European Americans encroached on their territory, the Comanche waged war on the settlers and raided their settlements, as well as those of neighboring Native American tribes. They took with them captives from other tribes during warfare, using them as slaves, selling them to the Spanish and (later) to Mexican settlers, or adopting them into their tribe. Thousands of captives from raids on Spanish, Mexican, and American settlers were assimilated into Comanche society. At their peak, the Comanche language was the lingua franca of the Great Plains region.

Diseases, destruction of the buffalo herds, and territory loss forced most Comanches on reservations in Indian Territory by the late 1870s.

In the 21st century, the Comanche Nation has 17,000 enrolled citizens, around 7,000 of whom reside in tribal jurisdictional areas around Lawton, Fort Sill, and the surrounding areas of southwestern Oklahoma. The Comanche Homecoming Annual Dance takes place in mid-July in Walters, Oklahoma.

== Name ==
The Comanche&#x27;s autonym is &quot;nʉmʉnʉʉ&quot;, meaning &quot;the human beings&quot; or &quot;the people&quot;. The earliest known use of the term &quot;Comanche&quot; dates to 1706, when the Comanche were reported by Spanish officials to be preparing to attack far-outlying Pueblo settlements in southern Colorado. The Spanish adopted the Ute name for the people: &quot;kɨmantsi&quot; (enemy), spelling it &quot;Comanche&quot; (or &quot;Comanchi&quot;, &quot;Cumanche&quot;, &quot;Cumanchi&quot;) in accord with the Spanish pronunciation. Before 1740, French explorers from the east sometimes used the name &quot;Padouca&quot; for the Comanche since it was already used for the Plains Apache and the French were not aware of the change of tribe in the region in the early 18th century.

==Government==
The Comanche Nation is headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma. Their tribal jurisdictional area is located in Caddo, Comanche, Cotton, Greer, Jackson, Kiowa, Tillman and Harmon counties. Their current Tribal Chairman is Mark Woommavovah. The tribe requires enrolled citizens to have at least 1/8 blood quantum level (equivalent to one great-grandparent).

==Economic development==
The tribe operates its own housing authority and issues tribal vehicle tags. They have their own Department of Higher Education, primarily awarding scholarships and financial aid for members&#x27; college educations. They own 10 tribal smoke shops and four casinos:
# Comanche Nation Casino in Lawton
# Red River Casino in Devol, Oklahoma 
# Comanche Spur Casino in Elgin, Oklahoma
# Comanche Star Casino in Walters, Oklahoma.

==Cultural institutions==

The Comanche National Museum and Cultural Center in Lawton, Oklahoma, has permanent and changing exhibitions on Comanche history and culture. It opened to the public in 2007.

In 2002, the tribe founded the Comanche Nation College, a two-year tribal college in Lawton. It closed in 2017 because of problems with accreditation and funding.

Each July, Comanche gather from across the United States to celebrate their heritage and culture in Walters at the annual Comanche Homecoming powwow. The Comanche Nation Fair takes place every September. The Comanche Little Ponies host two annual dances—one over New Year&#x27;s Eve and one in May.

==History==

===Formation===

The Proto-Comanche movement to the Plains was part of the larger phenomenon known as the &quot;Shoshonean Expansion&quot; in which that language family spread across the Great Basin and across the mountains into Wyoming. The Kotsoteka (&quot;Bison Eaters&quot;) were probably among the first. Other groups followed. Contact with the Shoshones of Wyoming was maintained until the 1830s when it was broken by the advancing Cheyennes and Arapahoes.

After the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, various Plains peoples acquired horses, but it was probably some time before they were very numerous. As late as 1725, Comanches were described as using large dogs rather than horses to carry their bison hide &quot;campaign tents&quot;.

The horse became a key element in the emergence of a distinctive Comanche culture. It was of such strategic importance that some scholars suggested that the Comanche broke away from the Shoshone and moved south to search for additional sources of horses among the settlers of New Spain to the south (rather than search for new herds of buffalo.) The Comanche have the longest documented existence as horse-mounted Plains peoples; they had horses when the Cheyennes still lived in earth lodges.

The Comanche supplied horses and mules to all comers. As early as 1795, Comanche were selling horses to Anglo-American traders and by the mid-19th century, Comanche-supplied horses were flowing into St. Louis via other Indian middlemen (Seminole, Osage, Shawnee).

Their original migration took them to the southern Great Plains, into a sweep of territory extending from the Arkansas River to central Texas. The earliest references to them in the Spanish records date from 1706, when reports reached Santa Fe that Utes and Comanches were about to attack. In the Comanche advance, the Apaches were driven off the Plains. By the end of the 18th century the struggle between Comanches and Apaches had assumed legendary proportions: in 1784, in recounting the history of the southern Plains, Texas governor Domingo Cabello y Robles recorded that some 60 years earlier (i.e., c. 1724) the Apaches had been routed from the southern Plains in a nine-day battle at La Gran Sierra del Fierro ‘The Great Mountain of Iron’, somewhere northwest of Texas. There is, however, no other record, documentary or legendary, of such a fight.

They were formidable warriors who developed strategies for using traditional weapons for fighting on horseback. Warfare was a major part of Comanche life. Comanche raids into Mexico traditionally took place during the full moon, when the Comanche could see to ride at night. This led to the term &quot;Comanche Moon&quot;, during which the Comanche raided for horses, captives, and weapons. Comanche raids, especially in the 1840s, reached hundreds of miles deep into Mexico devastating northern parts of the country. 

===Divisions===
Kavanagh has defined four levels of social-political integration in traditional pre-reservation Comanche society:
*Patrilineal and patrilocal nuclear family
*Extended family group (nʉmʉnahkahni – &quot;the people who live together in a household&quot;, no size limits, but kinship recognition was limited to relatives two generations above or three below)
*Residential local group or &#x27;band&#x27;, comprised one or more nʉmʉnahkahni, one of which formed its core. The band was the primary social unit of the Comanche. A typical band might number several hundred people. It was a family group, centered around a group of men, all of whom were relatives, sons, brothers or cousins. Since marriage with a known relative was forbidden, wives came from another group, and sisters left to join their husbands. The central man in that group was their grandfather, father, or uncle. He was called &#x27;paraivo&#x27;, &#x27;chief&#x27;. After his death, one of the other men took his place; if none were available, the band members might drift apart to other groups where they might have relatives and/or establish new relations by marrying an existing member. There was no separate term for or status of &#x27;peace chief&#x27; or &#x27;war chief&#x27;; any man leading a war party was a &#x27;war chief&#x27;.
*Division (sometimes called tribe, Spanish &quot;nación&quot;, &quot;rama&quot; – &quot;branch&quot;, comprising several local groups linked by kinship, sodalities (political, medicine, and military) and common interest in hunting, gathering, war, peace, trade).

In contrast to the neighboring Cheyenne and Arapaho to the north, there was never a single Comanche political unit or &quot;Nation&quot; recognized by all Comanches. Rather the divisions; the most &quot;tribe-like&quot; units, acted independently, pursuing their own economic and political goals.

Before the 1750s, the Spanish identified three Comanche Naciones (divisions): Hʉpenʉʉ (Jupe, Hoipi), Yaparʉhka (Yamparika), and Kʉhtsʉtʉhka (Kotsoteka).

After the Mescalero Apache, Jicarilla Apache and Lipan Apache had been largely displaced from the Southern Plains by the Comanche and allied tribes in the 1780s, the Spanish began to divide the now dominant Comanche into two geographical groups, which only partially corresponded to the former three Naciones. The Kʉhtsʉtʉhka (Kotsoteka) (&#x27;Buffalo Eaters&#x27;), which had moved southeast in the 1750s and 1760s to the Southern Plains in Texas, were called Cuchanec Orientales (&quot;Eastern Cuchanec/Kotsoteka&quot;) or Eastern Comanche, while those Kʉhtsʉtʉhka (Kotsoteka) that remained in the northwest and west, together with Hʉpenʉʉ (Jupe, Hoipi – &#x27;Timber/Forest People&#x27;) (and sometimes Yaparʉhka (Yamparika)), which had moved southward to the North Canadian River, were called Cuchanec Occidentales (&quot;Western Cuchanec/Kotsoteka&quot;) or Western Comanche. The &quot;Western Comanche&quot; lived in the region of the upper Arkansas, Canadian, and Red Rivers, and the Llano Estacado. The &quot;Eastern Comanche&quot; lived on the Edwards Plateau and the Texas plains of the upper Brazos and Colorado Rivers, and east to the Cross Timbers.
They were probably the ancestors of the Penatʉka Nʉʉ (Penateka – &#x27;Honey Eaters&#x27;).

Over time, these divisions were altered in various ways, primarily due to changes in political resources. As noted above, the Kʉhtsʉtʉhka (Kotsoteka) were probably the first proto-Comanche group to separate from the Eastern Shoshones.

The name Hʉpenʉʉ (Jupe, Hoipi) vanished from history in the early 19th century, probably merging into the other divisions, they are likely the forerunners of the Nokoni Nʉʉ (Nokoni), Kwaarʉ Nʉʉ (Kwahadi, Quohada), and the Hʉpenʉʉ (Hois) local group of the Penatʉka Nʉʉ (Penateka). Due to pressure by southwards moving Kiowa and Plains Apache (Naishan) raiders, many Yaparʉhka (Yamparika) moved southeast, joining the &quot;Eastern Comanche&quot; and becoming known as the Tahnahwah (Tenawa, Tenahwit). Many Kiowa and Plains Apache moved to northern Comancheria and became later closely associated with the Yaparʉhka (Yamparika).

In the mid 19th century, other powerful divisions arose, such as the Nokoni Nʉʉ (Nokoni) (&#x27;wanderers&#x27;, literally &#x27;go someplace and return&#x27;), and the Kwaarʉ Nʉʉ (Kwahadi, Quohada) (&#x27;Antelope Eaters&#x27;). The latter originally some local groups of the Kʉhtsʉtʉhka (Kotsoteka) from the Cimarron River Valley as well as descendants of some Hʉpenʉʉ (Jupe, Hoipi), which had pulled both southwards.

The northernmost Comanche division was the Yaparʉhka (Yapai Nʉʉ or Yamparika — ‘(Yap)Root-Eaters’). As the last band to move onto the Plains, they retained much of their Eastern Shoshone tradition.

The power and success of the Comanche attracted bands of neighboring peoples who joined them and became part of Comanche society; an Arapaho group became known as Saria Tʉhka (Chariticas, Sata Teichas – &#x27;Dog Eaters&#x27;) band, an Eastern Shoshone group as Pohoi (Pohoee – &#x27;wild sage&#x27;) band, and a Plains Apache group as Tasipenanʉʉ band.

The Texans and Americans divided the Comanche into five large dominant bands – the Yaparʉhka (Yamparika), Kʉhtsʉtʉhka (Kotsoteka), Nokoni Nʉʉ (Nokoni), Penatʉka Nʉʉ (Penateka) and Kwaarʉ Nʉʉ (Kwahadi, Quohada), which in turn were divided by geographical terms into first three (later four) regional groupings: Northern Comanche, Middle Comanche, Southern Comanche, Eastern Comanche, and later Western Comanche. However, these terms generally do not correspond to the Native language terms.
The &quot;Northern Comanche&quot; label encompassed the Yaparʉhka (Yamparika) between the Arkansas River and Canadian River and the prominent and powerful Kʉhtsʉtʉhka (Kotsoteka) who roamed the high plains of Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles between Red and Canadian River, the famous Palo Duro Canyon offered them and their horse herds of protection from strong winter storms as well as from enemies, because the two bands dominated and ranged in the northern Comancheria.

The &quot;Middle Comanche&quot; label encompassed the aggressive Nokoni Nʉʉ (Nokoni) (&quot;wanderers&quot;, &quot;those who turn back&quot;) between the headwaters of the Red River and the Colorado River in the south and the Western Cross Timbers in the east, their preferred range were on the Brazos River headwaters and its tributaries, the Pease River offered protection from storms and enemies. With them shared two smaller bands the same tribal areas: the Tahnahwah (Tenawa, Tenahwit) (&quot;Those Living Downstream&quot;) and Tanimʉʉ (Tanima, Dahaʉi, Tevawish) (&quot;Liver Eaters&quot;). All three bands together were known as &quot;Middle Comanche&quot; because they lived &quot;in the middle&quot; of the Comancheria.

The &quot;Southern Comanche&quot; label encompassed the Penatʉka Nʉʉ (Penateka) (&quot;Honey Eaters&quot;), the southernmost, largest, and best known band among whites as they lived near the first Spanish and Texan settlements; their tribal areas extended from the upper reaches of the rivers in central Texas and Colorado River southward, including much of the Edwards Plateau, and eastward to the Western Cross Timbers; because they dominated the southern Comancheria they were called &quot;Southern Comanche&quot;.

The &quot;Western Comanche&quot; label encompassed the Kwaarʉ Nʉʉ (Kwahadi, Quohada) (&#x27;Antelope Eaters&#x27;), which is the last to develop as an independent band in the 19th century. They lived on the hot, low-shadow desert plateaus of Llano Estacado in eastern New Mexico and found shelter in Tule Canyon and Palo Duro Canyon in northwestern Texas. They were the only band that never signed a contract with the Texans or Americans, and they were the last to give up the resistance. Because of their relative isolation from the other bands on the westernmost edge of the Comancheria, they were called the &quot;Western Comanche&quot;.

There has been, and continues to be, much confusion in the presentation of Comanche group names. Groups on all levels of organization, families, nʉmʉnahkahni, bands, and divisions, were given names, but many &#x27;band lists&#x27; do not distinguish these levels. In addition, there could be alternate names and nicknames. The spelling differences between Spanish and English add to the confusion.

===Some of the Comanche group names ===
* Yaparʉhka or Yamparika (also &quot;Yapai Nʉʉ&quot; – ‘(Yap)Root-Eaters’; One of its local groups may have been called &quot;Widyʉ Nʉʉ / Widyʉ / Widyʉ Yapa&quot; – ‘Awl People’; after the death of a man named &#x27;Awl&#x27; they changed their name to &quot;Tʉtsahkʉnanʉʉ&quot; or &quot;Ditsahkanah&quot; – ‘Sewing People’ [Titchahkaynah].

===Comanche Wars===

The Comanche fought a number of conflicts against Spanish and later Mexican and American armies. These were both expeditionary, as with the raids into Mexico, and defensive. The Comanche were noted as fierce warriors who fought vigorously for their homeland of Comancheria. However, the massive population of the settlers from the east and the diseases they brought led to pressure and decline of Comanche power and the of their major presence in the southern Great Plains.

===Relationship with settlers===


The Comanche maintained an ambiguous relationship with Europeans and later settlers attempting to colonize their territory. The Comanche were valued as trading partners since 1786 via the Comancheros of New Mexico, but were feared for their raids against settlers in Texas. Similarly, they were, at one time or another, at war with virtually every other Native American group living on the South Plains, leaving opportunities for political maneuvering by European colonial powers and the United States. At one point, Sam Houston, president of the newly created Republic of Texas, almost succeeded in reaching a peace treaty with the Comanche in the 1844 Treaty of Tehuacana Creek. His efforts were thwarted in 1845 when the Texas legislature refused to create an official boundary between Texas and the Comancheria.

While the Comanche managed to maintain their independence and increase their territory, by the mid-19th century, they faced annihilation because of a wave of epidemics due to Eurasian diseases to which they had no immunity, such as smallpox and measles. Outbreaks of smallpox (1817, 1848) and cholera (1849) took a major toll on the Comanche, whose population dropped from an estimated 20,000 in the late 18th century to just a few thousand by the 1870s.

The US began efforts in the late 1860s to move the Comanche into reservations, with the Treaty of Medicine Lodge (1867), which offered churches, schools, and annuities in return for a vast tract of land totaling over . The government promised to stop the buffalo hunters, who were decimating the great herds of the Plains, provided that the Comanche, along with the Apaches, Kiowas, Cheyenne, and Arapahos, move to a reservation totaling less than of land. However, the government did not prevent the slaughtering of the herds. The Comanche under Quenatosavit White Eagle (later called Isa-tai &quot;Coyote&#x27;s Vagina&quot;) retaliated by attacking a group of hunters in the Texas Panhandle in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls (1874). The attack was a disaster for the Comanche, and the US army was called in during the Red River War to drive the remaining Comanche in the area into the reservation, culminating in the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. Within just 10 years, the buffalo were on the verge of extinction, effectively ending the Comanche way of life as hunters. In May 1875, the last free band of Comanches, led by the Quahada warrior Quanah Parker, surrendered and moved to the Fort Sill reservation in Oklahoma. The last independent Kiowa and Kiowa Apache had also surrendered.

The 1890 Census showed 1,598 Comanche at the Fort Sill reservation, which they shared with 1,140 Kiowa and 326 Kiowa Apache.

====Meusebach–Comanche treaty====
The Peneteka band agreed to a peace treaty with the German Immigration Company under John O. Meusebach. This treaty was not affiliated with any level of government. Meusebach brokered the treaty to settle the lands on the Fisher-Miller Land Grant, from which were formed the 10 counties of Concho, Kimble, Llano, Mason, McCulloch, Menard, Schleicher, San Saba, Sutton, and Tom Green. In contrast to many treaties of its day, this treaty was very brief and simple, with all parties agreeing to a mutual cooperation and a sharing of the land. The treaty was agreed to at a meeting in San Saba County, and signed by all parties on May 9, 1847, in Fredericksburg, Texas. The treaty was very specifically between the Peneteka band and the German Immigration Company. No other band or tribe was involved. The German Immigration Company was dissolved by Meusebach himself shortly after it had served its purpose. By 1875, the Comanches had been relocated to reservations. Five years later, artist Friedrich Richard Petri and his family moved to the settlement of Pedernales, near Fredericksburg. Petri&#x27;s sketches and watercolors gave witness to the friendly relationships between the Germans and various local Native American tribes.

====Fort Martin Scott treaty====
In 1850, another treaty was signed in San Saba, between the United States government and a number of local tribes, among which were the Comanches. This treaty was named for the nearest military fort, which was Fort Martin Scott. The treaty was never officially ratified by any level of government and was binding only on the part of the Native Americans.

====Cherokee Commission====
The signed with the Cherokee Commission October 6–21, 1892, further reduced their reservation to at a cost of $1.25 per acre ($308.88/km2), with an allotment of per person per tribe to be held in trust. New allotments were made in 1906 to all children born after the agreement, and the remaining land was opened to white settlement. With this new arrangement, the era of the Comanche reservation came to an abrupt end.

====Captive Herman Lehmann====
One of the most famous captives in Texas was a German boy named Herman Lehmann. He had been kidnapped by the Apaches, only to escape and be rescued by the Comanches. Lehmann became the adoptive son of Quanah Parker. On August 26, 1901, Quanah Parker provided a legal affidavit verifying Lehmann&#x27;s life as his adopted son 1877–1878. On May 29, 1908, the United States Congress authorized the United States Secretary of the Interior to allot Lehmann, as an adopted member of the Comanche nation, 160 acres of Oklahoma land, near Grandfield.

===Recent history===
Entering the Western economy was a challenge for the Comanche in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many tribal members were defrauded of whatever remained of their land and possessions. Appointed paramount chief by the United States government, Chief Quanah Parker campaigned vigorously for better deals for his people, meeting with Washington politicians frequently; and helped manage land for the tribe.

Parker became wealthy as a cattleman. He also campaigned for the Comanches&#x27; permission to practice the Native American Church religious rites, such as the usage of peyote, which was condemned by European Americans.

Before the first Oklahoma legislature, Quanah testified:
I do not think this legislature should interfere with a man&#x27;s religion, also these people should be allowed to retain this health restorer. These healthy gentleman before you use peyote and those that do not use it are not so healthy.

During World War II, many Comanche left the traditional tribal lands in Oklahoma to seek jobs and more opportunities in the cities of California and the Southwest. About half of the Comanche population still lives in Oklahoma, centered on the town of Lawton.

Recently, an 80-minute 1920 silent film was &quot;rediscovered&quot;, titled &quot;The Daughter of Dawn.&quot; It features a cast of more than 300 Comanche and Kiowa.

==Culture==

===Childbirth===

If a woman went into labor while the band was in camp, she was moved to a tipi, or a brush lodge if it was summer. One or more of the older women assisted as midwives. Men were not allowed inside the tipi during or immediately after the delivery.

First, the midwives softened the earthen floor of the tipi and dug two holes. One of the holes was for heating water and the other for the afterbirth. One or two stakes were driven into the ground near the expectant mother&#x27;s bedding for her to grip during the pain of labor. After the birth, the midwives hung the umbilical cord on a hackberry tree. The people believed that if the umbilical cord was not disturbed before it rotted, the baby would live a long and prosperous life.

The newborn was swaddled and remained with its mother in the tipi for a few days. The baby was placed in a cradleboard, and the mother went back to work. She could easily carry the cradleboard on her back, or prop it against a tree where the baby could watch her while she collected seeds or roots. Cradleboards consisted of a flat board to which a basket was attached. The latter was made from rawhide straps, or a leather sheath that laced up the front. With soft, dry moss as a diaper, the young one was safely tucked into the leather pocket. During cold weather, the baby was wrapped in blankets, and then placed in the cradleboard. The baby remained in the cradleboard for about ten months; then it was allowed to crawl around.

Both girls and boys were welcomed into the band, but boys were favored. If the baby was a boy, one of the midwives informed the father or grandfather, &quot;It&#x27;s your close friend&quot;. Families might paint a flap on the tipi to tell the rest of the tribe that they had been strengthened with another warrior. Sometimes a man named his child, but mostly the father asked a medicine man (or another man of distinction) to do so. He did this in the hope of his child living a long and productive life. During the public naming ceremony, the medicine man lit his pipe and offered smoke to the heavens, earth, and each of the four directions. He prayed that the child would remain happy and healthy. He then lifted the child to symbolize its growing up and announced the child&#x27;s name four times. He held the child a little higher each time he said the name. It was believed that the child&#x27;s name foretold its future; even a weak or sick child could grow up to be a great warrior, hunter, and raider if given a name suggesting courage and strength. Boys were often named after their grandfather, uncle, or other relative. Girls were usually named after one of their father&#x27;s relatives, but the name was selected by the mother. As children grew up they also acquired nicknames at different points in their lives, to express some aspect of their lives.

===Children===

The Comanche looked on their children as their most precious gift. Children were rarely punished. Sometimes, though, an older sister or other relative was called upon to discipline a child, or the parents arranged for a boogey man to scare the child. Occasionally, old people donned sheets and frightened disobedient boys and girls. Children were also told about Big Maneater Owl (&quot;Pia Mupitsi&quot;), who lived in a cave on the south side of the Witchita Mountains and ate bad children at night.

Children learned from example, by observing and listening to their parents and others in the band. As soon as she was old enough to walk, a girl followed her mother about the camp and played at the daily tasks of cooking and making clothing. She was also very close to her mother&#x27;s sisters, who were called not aunt but &quot;pia&quot;, meaning mother. She was given a little deerskin doll, which she took with her everywhere. She learned to make all the clothing for the doll.

A boy identified not only with his father but with his father&#x27;s family, as well as with the bravest warriors in the band. He learned to ride a horse before he could walk. By the time he was four or five, he was expected to be able to skillfully handle a horse. When he was five or six, he was given a small bow and arrows. Often, a boy was taught to ride and shoot by his grandfather, since his father and other warriors were on raids and hunts. His grandfather also taught him about his own boyhood and the history and legends of the Comanche.
As the boy grew older, he joined the other boys to hunt birds. He eventually ranged farther from camp looking for better game to kill. Encouraged to be skillful hunters, boys learned the signs of the prairie as they learned to patiently and quietly stalk game. They became more self-reliant, yet, by playing together as a group, also formed the bonds and cooperative spirit that they would need when they hunted and raided.
Boys were highly respected because they would become warriors and might die young in battle. As he approached manhood, a boy went on his first buffalo hunt. If he made a kill, his father honored him with a feast. Only after he had proven himself on a buffalo hunt was a young man allowed to go to war.

When he was ready to become a warrior, at about age 15 or 16, a young man first &quot;made his medicine&quot; by going on a vision quest (a rite of passage). Following this quest, his father gave him a good horse to ride into battle and another mount for the trail. If he had proved himself as a warrior, a Give Away Dance might be held in his honor. As drummers faced east, the honored boy and other young men danced. His parents, along with his other relatives and the people in the band, threw presents at his feet – especially blankets and horses symbolized by sticks. Anyone might snatch one of the gifts for themselves, although those with many possessions refrained; they did not want to appear greedy. People often gave away all their belongings during these dances, providing for others in the band, but leaving themselves with nothing.

Girls learned to gather berries, nuts, and roots. They carried water and collected wood, and at about 12 years old learned to cook meals, make tipis, sew clothing, prepare hides, and perform other tasks essential to becoming a wife and mother. They were then considered ready to be married.

===Death===
During the 19th century, the traditional Comanche burial custom was to wrap the deceased&#x27;s body in a blanket and place it on a horse, behind a rider, who would then ride in search of an appropriate burial place, such as a secure cave. After entombment, the rider covered the body with stones and returned to camp, where the mourners burned all the deceased&#x27;s possessions. The primary mourner slashed his arms to express his grief. The Quahada band followed this custom longer than other bands and buried their relatives in the Witchita Mountains. Christian missionaries persuaded Comanche people to bury their dead in coffins in graveyards, which is the practice today.

===Transportation and habitation===

When they lived with the Shoshone, the Comanche mainly used dog-drawn travois for transportation. Later, they acquired horses from other tribes, such as the Pueblo, and from the Spaniards. Because horses are faster, easier to control and stronger, this helped with hunting, warfare and moving camp. Larger dwellings were made due to the ability to pull and carry more belongings. Being herbivores, horses were also easier to feed than dogs, since meat was a valuable resource. The horse was of the utmost value to the Comanche. A Comanche man&#x27;s wealth was measured by the size of his horse herd. Horses were prime targets to steal during raids; often raids were conducted specifically to capture horses. Often horse herds numbering in the hundreds were stolen by Comanche during raids against other Indian nations, Spanish, Mexicans, and later from the ranches of Texans. Horses were used for warfare with the Comanche being considered to be among the finest light cavalry and mounted warriors in history.
The Comanche covered their tipis with buffalo hides sewn together. To prepare the hides, women spread them on the ground, scraped off the fat and flesh with blades of bone or antler, and dried them in the sun. Then the women scraped off the thick hair and soaked the hides in water. After several days, they vigorously rubbed them in a mixture of fat, brains and liver to soften them. They softened them further by rinsing and working back and forth over a rawhide thong. Finally, they were smoked over a fire, which gave them a tan color. To finish the tipi covering, women laid the tanned hides side by side and stitched them together. As many as 22 hides could be used, but 14 was the average. The sewn cover was tied to a pole and raised, wrapped around the cone-shaped frame, and pinned with pencil-sized wooden skewers. Two wing-shaped flaps at the top of the tipi were turned back to make an opening, which could be adjusted to keep out moisture and held pockets of insulating air. With a fire pit in the center of the earthen floor, the tipis stayed warm in winter. In summer, the bottom edges of the tipis could be rolled up to let in a breeze. Cooking was done outside during hot weather. Tipis were very practical homes for nomads. Working together, women could quickly set them up or take them down. An entire Comanche band could be packed and chasing a buffalo herd within about 20 minutes. The women did most food processing and preparation.

===Food===
The Comanche were initially hunter-gatherers. When they lived in the Rocky Mountains, during their migration to the Great Plains, both men and women shared responsibility for gathering and providing food. When the Comanche reached the plains, hunting predominated. Hunting was considered a male activity and was a principal source of prestige. For meat, the Comanche hunted bison, elk, black bear, pronghorn, and deer. When game was scarce, the men hunted wild mustangs, and sometimes ate their own ponies. In later years the Comanche raided Texas ranches and stole longhorn cattle. They did not eat fish or fowl, unless starving. 

Women prepared and cooked bison meat and other game. Women also gathered wild fruits, seeds, nuts, berries, roots and tubers, including plums, grapes, juniper berries, persimmons, mulberries, acorns, pecans, wild onions, radishes, and tuna, the fruit of the prickly pear cactus. The Comanche also acquired maize, dried pumpkin, and tobacco through trade and raids. They roasted meat over a fire or boiled it. To boil fresh or dried meat and vegetables, women dug a pit in the ground, which they lined with animal skins or bison stomach and filled with water to make a kind of cooking pot. They placed heated stones in the water until it boiled and had cooked their stew. After Spanish contact, Comanche traded for copper pots and iron kettles, which made cooking easier.

Women used berries and nuts, as well as honey and tallow, to flavor bison meat. They stored the tallow in intestine casings or rawhide pouches called &quot;oyóotû¿&quot;. They especially liked to make a sweet mush of bison marrow mixed with crushed mesquite beans.

The Comanches sometimes ate raw meat, especially raw liver flavored with gall. They also drank the milk from the slashed udders of bison, deer, and elk. Among their delicacies was the curdled milk from the stomachs of suckling bison calves. They also enjoyed bison tripe, or stomachs.

Comanche generally ate a light meal breakfast and a large dinner. They ate during the day when they were hungry or when it was convenient. Like other Plains tribes, the Comanche were very hospitable. They prepared meals whenever a visitor arrived in camp, which led to outsiders&#x27; belief that the Comanches ate at all hours of the day or night. Many families offered thanks as they sat down to eat their meals.

Comanche children ate pemmican, but this was primarily a tasty, high-energy food reserved for war parties. Carried in a parfleche pouch, pemmican was eaten only when the men did not have time to hunt. Similarly, in camp, people ate pemmican only when other food was scarce. Traders ate pemmican sliced and dipped in honey, which they called Indian bread.

===Clothing===
Comanche clothing was simple and easy to wear. Men wore a leather belt with a breechcloth — a long piece of buckskin brought up between the legs and looped over and under the belt at the front and back, and loose-fitting deerskin leggings. Moccasins had soles made from thick, tough buffalo hide with soft deerskin uppers. Men wore nothing on the upper body, except in winter when they wore heavy robes of buffalo hide (or occasionally, bear, wolf, or coyote skins) with knee-length buffalo-hide boots. Young boys usually went naked except in cold weather. By age 8 or 9, they wore adult clothing. In the 19th century, men had replaced the buckskin breechcloths by woven cloth, and wore loose-fitting buckskin shirts. Women wore long deerskin dresses with a flared skirt and wide, long sleeves, with buckskin fringes on the sleeves and hem. Beads and pieces of metal were attached in geometric patterns. Women wore buckskin moccasins with buffalo soles. Women decorated their shirts, leggings and moccasins with fringes of deer-skin, animal fur, and human hair. They also decorated their shirts and leggings with patterns and shapes of beads and scraps of material. In winter they, too, wore warm buffalo robes and tall, fur-lined buffalo-hide boots. Unlike boys, girls old enough to walk were dressed in breechcloths. By age 12 or 13, they wore women&#x27;s clothing.

===Hair and headgear===
Comanche people took pride in their hair, which was worn long. They arranged it with porcupine quill brushes, greased it and parted it in the center from the forehead to the back of the neck. They painted the scalp along the parting with yellow, red, or white clay (or other colors). They wore their hair in two long braids tied with leather thongs or colored cloth, and sometimes wrapped with beaver fur. They also braided a strand of hair from the top of their head. This slender braid, called a scalp lock, was decorated with colored scraps of cloth and beads, and a single feather. Comanche men rarely wore anything on their heads. Only after they moved onto a reservation late in the 19th century did men begin to wear the typical Plains headdress. In severe cold, they might wear a brimless, woolly buffalo hide hat. At war, some warriors wore a headdress of buffalo scalp. Warriors cut away most of the hide and flesh from a buffalo head, leaving only a portion of the woolly head and the horns. This type of hat was worn only by the Comanche. Women did not let their hair grow as long as the men did. Young women might wear their hair long and braided, but women parted their hair in the middle and kept it short. Like the men, they painted their scalp along the parting with bright paint.

===Body decoration===
Comanche men usually had pierced ears with hanging earrings made of pieces of shell or loops of brass or silver wire. A female relative would pierce the outer edge of the ear with six or eight holes. The men also tattooed his face, arms, and chest with geometric designs, and painted his face and body. Traditionally they used paints made of berry juice and the colored clays of the Comancheria. Later, traders supplied them with vermilion (red pigment) and bright grease paints. Men wore bands of leather and strips of metal on their arms. Except for black, which was the color for war, there was no standard color or pattern for face and body painting: it was a matter of individual preference. For example, one man might paint one side of his face white and the other side red; another might paint one side of his body green and the other side with green and black stripes. One Comanche might always paint himself in a particular way, while another might change the colors and designs when so inclined. Some designs had special meaning to the individual, and special colors and designs might have been revealed in a dream. Women might also tattoo their face or arms. They were fond of painting their bodies and were free to do so as they pleased. It was popular for women to paint the insides of their ears a bright red and paint great orange and red circles on their cheeks. They usually painted red and yellow around their lips. 
=== Art and material culture ===
Because of their frequent nomadic traveling, Comanche had to make sure that their household goods and other possessions were unbreakable. They did not use pottery that could easily be broken on long journeys. Weaving, wood carving, and metal working were unknown. Instead, they depended on buffalo for most of their tools, household goods, and weapons. They made nearly 200 different utilitarian items from the horns, hide, and bones.

Removing the lining of the inner stomach, women made the paunch into a water bag. The lining was stretched over four sticks and filled with water to make a pot for cooking soups and stews. With wood scarce on the plains, women relied on buffalo chips (dried dung) as fuel for cooking and heat.

Stiff rawhide was fashioned into saddles, stirrups and cinches, knife cases, buckets, and moccasin soles. Rawhide was also made into rattles and drums. Strips of rawhide were twisted into sturdy ropes. Scraped to resemble white parchment, rawhide skins were folded to make parfleches in which food, clothing, and other personal belongings were kept. Women also tanned hides to make soft and supple buckskin, which was used for tipi covers, warm robes, blankets, cloths, and moccasins. They used buckskin for bedding, cradles, dolls, bags, pouches, quivers, and gun cases.

Sinew was used for bowstrings and sewing thread. Hooves were turned into glue and rattles. Horns were shaped into cups, spoons, and ladles, while the tail made a whip, fly-swatter, or a tipi decoration. Men made tools, scrapers, needles, pipes and children&#x27;s toys from the bones. But men concentrated on making bows and arrows, lances, and shields. The thick neck skin of an old bull was ideal for war shields that deflected arrows as well as bullets. Since they spent most of each day on horseback, they also fashioned leather into saddles, stirrups, and other equipment for their mounts. Buffalo hair was used to fill saddle pads and was used in rope and halters.

===Language===

The language spoken by the Comanche people, &quot;Comanche&quot; (&quot;Numu tekwapu&quot;), is a Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan language group. It is closely related to the language of the Shoshone, from which the Comanche diverged around 1700. The two languages remain closely related, but a few low-level sound changes inhibit mutual intelligibility. The earliest records of Comanche from 1786 clearly show a dialect of Shoshone, but by the beginning of the 20th century, these sound changes had modified the way Comanche sounded in subtle, but profound, ways. Although efforts are now being made to ensure survival of the language, most of its speakers are elderly, and less than 1% of the Comanches can speak it.

In the late 19th century, many Comanche children were placed in boarding schools with children from different tribes. The children were taught English and discouraged from speaking their native language. Anecdotally, enforcement of speaking English was severe.

Quanah Parker learned and spoke English and was adamant that his own children do the same. The second generation then grew up speaking English, because it was believed that it was better for them not to know Comanche.

Comanches were among the Native Americans who were first utilized as code talkers by the U.S. Army during World War I.

During World War II, a group of 17 young men, referred to as &quot;the Comanche code talkers&quot;, were trained and used by the U.S. Army to send messages conveying sensitive information that could not be deciphered by the Germans.

== Population history ==
In 1832 Comanche chiefs told George Catlin that the tribe numbered up to 40,000 people, being able to muster up to 8,000 warriors. This high population appears to be confirmed by Bourgmont who was told by a Comanche chief that the tribe consisted of 12 villages and when Bourgmont visited one of those villages, he found there 800 warriors (if every other village was equally populous, the total number of warriors would be 9,600). In 1774 a French trader, J. Gaignard, wrote that one division of the Comanche (the Naytane, also known as Yamparika) had 4,000 warriors divided into four bands which were never together. In 1786 Spaniards estimated that the Comanches may have numbered up to 30,000. Jedidiah Morse around year 1820 estimated the Comanche at between 38,000 and 41,000. In 1819 three bands of the Comanche were reported as 2,500 warriors. Indian Affairs 1837 reported 19,200 people. Charles Bent in 1847 reported that they had 2,500 lodges. Indian Affairs 1849 reported them as 4,000 warriors and 20,000 total population. Around the mid-19th century A. W. Whipple, E. Domenech and H. Howe all reported that the Comanche numbered up to 30,000. The Comanche population apparently rapidly declined in the 2nd half of the 19th century. The census of 1890 found only 1,598 in Oklahoma. According to Indian Affairs there were 1,507 (in 1895), 1,499 (in 1900), 1401 (in 1905) and 1,476 (in 1910). The census of 1910 reported only 1,171.

Comanche population has rebounded in the 20th and 21st centuries. There are 17,000 Comanche Nation citizens. In the 2020 US census, 39,808 Americans stated they were Comanche.

<text>Le Havre is a major port city in the Seine-Maritime department in the Normandy region of northern France. It is situated on the right bank of the estuary of the river Seine on the Channel southwest of the Pays de Caux, very close to the Prime Meridian. Le Havre is the most populous commune of Upper Normandy, although the total population of the greater Le Havre conurbation is smaller than that of Rouen. After Reims, it is also the second largest subprefecture in France. The name &quot;Le Havre&quot; means &quot;the harbour&quot; or &quot;the port&quot;. Its inhabitants are known as &quot;Havrais&quot; or &quot;Havraises&quot;.

The city and port were founded by King Francis I in 1517. Economic development in the early modern period was hampered by religious wars, conflicts with the English, epidemics, and storms. It was from the end of the 18th century that Le Havre started growing and the port took off first with the slave trade then other international trade. After the 1944 bombings the firm of Auguste Perret began to rebuild the city in concrete. The oil, chemical, and automotive industries were dynamic during the Trente Glorieuses (postwar boom) but the 1970s marked the end of the golden age of ocean liners and the beginning of the economic crisis: the population declined, unemployment increased and remains at a high level today.

Changes in years 1990–2000 were numerous. The right won the municipal elections and committed the city to the path of reconversion, seeking to develop the service sector and new industries (aeronautics, wind turbines). The Port 2000 project increased the container capacity to compete with ports of northern Europe, transformed the southern districts of the city, and ocean liners returned. Modern Le Havre remains deeply influenced by its employment and maritime traditions. Its port is the second largest in France, after that of Marseille, for total traffic, and the largest French container port.

In 2005, UNESCO inscribed the central city of Le Havre as a World Heritage Site because of its unique post-WWII reconstruction and architecture. The André Malraux Modern Art Museum is the second of France for the number of impressionist paintings. The city has been awarded two flowers by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of Cities and Villages in Bloom.

==Toponym==
The name of the town was attested in 1489, even before it was founded by François I in the form &quot;le Hable de Grace&quot; then &quot;Ville de Grace&quot; in 1516, two years before its official founding. The learned and transient name of &quot;Franciscopolis&quot; in tribute to the same king, is encountered in some documents then that of &quot;Havre Marat&quot;, referring to Jean-Paul Marat during the French Revolution but was not imposed. However it explains why the complementary determinant &quot;-de-Grace&quot; was not restored. This qualifier undoubtedly referred to the Chapel of Notre Dame located at the site of the cathedral of the same name. The chapel faced the Chapel Notre Dame de Grace of Honfleur across the estuary. The common noun &quot;havre&quot; meaning &quot;port&quot; was out of use at the end of the 18th or beginning of the 19th centuries but is still preserved in the phrase &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;safe haven&quot;. It is generally considered a loan from Middle Dutch from the 12th century. A Germanic origin can explain the &quot;aspiration&quot; of the initial &quot;h&quot;. Havre de Grace, Maryland, in the United States retains the &quot;de Grace&quot; from colonial times.

New research however focuses on the fact that the term was attested very early (12th century) and in Norman texts in the forms &quot;Hable&quot;, &quot;hafne&quot;, &quot;havene&quot;, &quot;havne&quot;, and &quot;haule&quot; makes a Dutch origin unlikely. By contrast, a Scandinavian etymology is relevant given the old Scandinavian &quot;höfn&quot; (genitive &quot;hafnar&quot;) or &quot;hafn&quot; meaning &quot;natural harbour&quot; or &quot;haven&quot; and the phonetic evolution of the term &quot;étrave&quot; which is assuredly of Scandinavian origin is also attested in similar forms such as &quot;estable&quot; and probably dates back to the ancient Scandinavian &quot;stafn&quot;.

==History==
When founded in 1517, the city was named &quot;Franciscopolis&quot; after Francis I of France. It was subsequently named &quot;Le Havre-de-Grâce&quot; (&quot;Harbor of Grace&quot;; hence Havre de Grace, Maryland). Its construction was ordered to replace the ancient harbours of Honfleur and Harfleur whose utility had decreased due to silting.

The history of the city is inextricably linked to its harbour. In the 18th century, as trade from the West Indies was added to that of France and Europe, Le Havre began to grow. On 19 November 1793, the city changed its name to Hâvre de Marat and later Hâvre-Marat in honor of the recently deceased Jean-Paul Marat, who was seen as a martyr of the French Revolution. By early 1795, however, Marat&#x27;s memory had become somewhat tarnished, and on 13 January 1795, Hâvre-Marat changed its name once more to simply Le Havre, its modern name. During the 19th century, it became an industrial center.

At the end of World War I Le Havre played a major role as the transit port used to wind up affairs after the war.

The city was devastated during the Battle of Normandy when 5,000 people were killed and 12,000 homes were totally destroyed before its capture in Operation Astonia. The center was rebuilt in a modernist style by Auguste Perret.

===Heraldry===
==Geography==

===Location===
Le Havre is located west of Rouen on the shore of the English Channel and at the mouth of the Seine. Numerous roads link to Le Havre with the main access roads being the A29 autoroute from Amiens and the A13 autoroute from Paris linking to the A131 autoroute.

Administratively, Le Havre is a commune in the Normandy region in the west of the department of Seine-Maritime. The urban area of Le Havre corresponds roughly to the territory of the Agglomeration community of Le Havre (CODAH) which includes 17 communes and 250,000 people. It occupies the south-western tip of the natural region of Pays de Caux where it is the largest city. Le Havre is sandwiched between the coast of the Channel from south-west to north-west and the estuary of the Seine to the south.

===Geology and terrain===
Le Havre belongs to the Paris Basin which was formed in the Mesozoic period. The Paris Basin consists of sedimentary rocks. The commune of Le Havre consists of two areas separated by a natural cliff edge: one part in the lower part of the town to the south including the harbour, the city centre and the suburbs. It was built on former marshland and mudflats that were drained in the 16th century. The soil consists of several metres of alluvium or silt deposited by the Seine. The city centre was rebuilt after the Second World War using a metre of flattened rubble as a foundation.

The upper town to the north, is part of the cauchois plateau: the neighbourhood of Dollemard is its highest point (between above sea level). The plateau is covered with a layer of flinty clay and a fertile silt. The bedrock consists of a large thickness of chalk measuring up to deep. Because of the slope the coast is affected by the risk of landslides.

===Climate===
Due to its location on the coast of the Channel, the climate of Le Havre is temperate oceanic. Days without wind are rare. There are maritime influences throughout the year. According to the records of the meteorological station of the Cap de la Heve (from 1961 to 1990), the temperature drops below on 24.9 days per year and it rises above on 11.3 days per year. The average annual sunshine duration is 1,785.8 hours per year.

Precipitation is distributed throughout the year, with a maximum in autumn and winter. The months of June and July are marked by some thunderstorms on average 2 days per month. One of the characteristics of the region is the high variability of the temperature, even during the day. The prevailing winds are from the southwest sector for strong winds and north-north-east for breezes, snowstorms occur in winter, especially in January and February.

The absolute speed record for wind at Le Havre – Cap de la Heve was recorded on 16 October 1987 at .

The main natural hazards are floods, storms, and storm surges. The lower town is subject to a rising water table. The lack of watercourses within the commune prevents flooding from overflows. Le Havre&#x27;s beach may rarely experience flooding known as &quot;flooding from storms&quot;. These are caused by the combination of strong winds, high waves, and a large tidal range.

===Environment===

A study by &quot;Aphekom&quot; comparing ten large French cities showed that Le Havre is the least polluted urban commune of France. Le Havre is also the third best city in France with more than 100,000 inhabitants for air quality. A Carbon accounting showed in 2009 that the municipality ejected some 32,500 tonnes of CO2 per year. In 2011 the average annual emissions of sulfur dioxide by industry was between three micrograms per cubic metre in the centre of Le Havre to twelve micrograms per cubic metre in the district of Caucriauville.

The municipality has set a target to reduce emissions of CO2 by 3% per year. To achieve this solar panels have been installed on several municipal buildings (city hall, hanging gardens). Since 2008, Le Havre has been part of the network of Energy Cities and, in this context, it applies the steps of Agenda 21 and an Environmental Approach to Urban Planning. The city has received many awards of eco-labels several times (Energy of the Future label in 2009–2011, sustainable Earth label in 2009). Since 1998, Le Havre&#x27;s beach has received the Blue Flag yearly thanks to its range of facilities, which extend over 30,000m.

Le Havre has kept extensive green areas (750 hectares or 41m per inhabitant), the two largest areas are the Montgeon Forest and Rouelles Park which are both located in the upper town. The gardens of the Priory of Graville and the hanging gardens offer views of the lower city. In the city centre, Saint-Roch Square and the City Hall Gardens provide the people with urban recreation areas. Various ecosystems are represented in the Beach Gardens and the Hauser Park (caves). Finally, the Plateau of Dollemard was classified as a &quot;Sensitive Natural Area&quot; of the department in 2001 to protect its landscape and ecosystems on the cliff. The streets are lined with 13,000 trees of 150 different varieties.

==Layout==

===Lower city===

====City rebuilt after 1945====
Largely destroyed by the Allies during the Second World War, the city was rebuilt according to the plans of the architect Auguste Perret between 1945 and 1964. Only the City Hall and the Church of Saint Joseph (107m-high) were personally designed by Auguste Perret. In commending the reconstruction work UNESCO listed the city of Le Havre on 15 July 2005 as a World Heritage Site. This area of 133 hectares is one of the few inscribed contemporary sites in Europe. The architecture of the area is characterized by the use of precast concrete using a system of a modular frame of 6.24 metres and straight lines.

Another notable architectural work of the central city is that of the &quot;House of Culture&quot; built in 1982 by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and nicknamed &quot;the Volcano&quot; because of the shape of the building. From 2012, this place was refurbished both inside and outside with fairly significant changes approved by the architect including greater openness to the outside of the plaza.

The Notre Dame and Perrey neighbourhoods are mainly residential. Les Halles is one of the commercial hubs of the city. The Saint Francis neighborhood was also rebuilt beginning in 1950 but in a radically different architectural style: the buildings are brick and have pitched slate roofs. This is the restaurant district and the fish market.

====Neighbourhoods====
To the east and north of the rebuilt central city are a stretch of old neighbourhoods (Danton, Saint-Vincent, Graville, Massillon, etc.) which were spared the bombings of World War II. The buildings, usually in brick, dated to the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries. The shops are concentrated along several major roads in the Rond-Point neighbourhood. During the 1990s and 2000s, these neighborhoods have seen major redevelopments, particularly in the context of an OPAH: improvement of habitat by rehabilitation or reconstruction, creation of public facilities, and revitalization of business.

At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, the area around the railway station has undergone a major transformation. As the station is the gateway to the city with the main avenues intersecting here. New buildings have sprung up (University of Le Havre, the conservatory, headquarters of the SPB (Provident Society Bank), and of CMA CGM, Novotel, Matmut, new CCI) some of which were designed by renowned architects. The bus station, certified &quot;NF&quot; since 2005, has been refurbished. North of the station, another construction project in place of the dilapidated island of Turgot-Magellan will be opened in 2013, including of office space and an eight-storey hotel, complete with shops on the ground-floor.

====Southern districts====
The southern districts of Le Havre are mainly used for industrial and port activities. There are buildings in brick from the 19th century, large developments (Chicago, Les Neiges), worker estates, SMEs, warehouses, dock and port facilities, and transport infrastructure. 

The southern districts have for some years experienced profound change due to European funding. It is revitalizing areas neglected by industrial and port activities by developing tertiary activities. Thus, the docks have been completely transformed into sports and entertainment complexes (Dock Océane), a mall (Docks Vauban), and an exhibition hall (Docks Café). Les Bains Des Docks was designed by the architect Jean Nouvel. At the end of 2012 students from Sciences-Po Europe Asia and from INSA integrated new buildings next to the ISEL (Higher Institute of logistics studies) and the future ENSM (Ecole Nationale Supérieure Maritime). The new medical axis around the new &quot;Clinic des Ormeaux&quot; was built in the neighbourhoods where many homes are planned with the aim of promoting social mix. The &quot;City of the Sea and of Sustainable Development&quot; (Odyssey 21) will be organized around a metal tower one hundred metres high designed by Jean Nouvel: the project was suspended in 2007 but the work should finally begin in 2013. The municipality has to attract some 300,000 visitors per year.

===Upper town===
The upper town is composed of three parts: the &quot;coast&quot;, the suburban districts of the plateau, and large peripheral housing estates.

The neighbourhoods on the &quot;coast&quot; (the Dead Cliff) are residential – more prosperous in the western part (Les Ormeaux, Rue Felix Faure) and more modest to the east (St. Cecilia, Aplemont). The Jenner tunnel passes under the &quot;coast&quot; and connects the upper town to the lower town. It is also on the coast that there are two fortifications of the city, Forts Sainte-Adresse and Tourneville, and the main cemetery (Sainte-Marie cemetery). With the demise of the military functions of the city, the forts are gradually being converted: Fort Sainte-Adresse houses the &quot;Hanging Gardens&quot; and Fort Tourneville hosted the Tetris project in 2013 – an axis of contemporary music with concert halls and rehearsal studios.

To the north of the &quot;coast&quot; suburban districts such as Rouelles, Sainte-Cecile, la Mare au Clerc, Sanvic, Bleville, and Dollemard were developed during the first half of the 19th century. In their extension North-west between Bleville and Octeville airport a new area is being developed: &quot;Les Hauts de Bleville&quot;. This eco-district made up of housing units to HQE standards, a Joint Development Area (ZAC), and a school should have a total of 1,000 housing units.

The peripheral suburbs of the commune grew in the postwar period. These are large housing estates in Caucriauville, Bois de Bleville, Mont-Gaillard, and Mare-rouge where a disadvantaged population is concentrated. In October 2004 the National Agency for Urban Renewal (ANRU) signed with the municipality of Havre the first agreement to finance the rehabilitation of these areas. This finance agreement provides more than 340 million euros for the housing estates in the northern districts, where about 41,000 people reside. This development extends the budget for the &quot;Grand Projet de Ville&quot; (GPV). It allows the demolition and rebuilding of more than 1,700 homes.

==Transport==

For a long time Le Havre has exploited the strengths of its coastal location but also suffered from its relative isolation. This is why the accessibility of the city has been improved with the harbour highway A131 (E05) which links Le Havre to the A13 autoroute over Tancarville Bridge. The city is one hour from Rouen and one and a half-hour from Île-de-France. More recently the A29 autoroute (E44) has connected Le Havre to the north of France and passes over the Normandy Bridge which makes Amiens (in the north-east) two hours away and Caen (in the south-west) one hour.

The TER network was modernized with the creation of the LER line in 2001 and direct services to Fécamp in 2005. Thirteen Corail trains of the Paris–Le Havre line link Le Havre station with Bréauté-Beuzeville, Yvetot, Rouen and Paris Saint-Lazare station. In addition there is a TGV daily service to Le Havre: it has connected the city to Marseille since December 2004 serving Rouen, Mantes-la-Jolie, Versailles, Massy, Lyon, Avignon, Aix-en-Provence, and Saint Charles station in Marseille. There are also local services from Le Havre station to Rolleville and Fécamp. Le Havre-Graville station in the eastern part of the city is served by trains to Rolleville.

No direct rail link connects Le Havre and Caen yet many projects – known as the &quot;Southwest Line&quot; – to link Le Havre to the left bank of the Seine downstream from Rouen, near the estuary of the river, were studied in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century but none have been realized. By public transport it is necessary to go to Rouen by train or bus (using No. 20 Green Bus). There is a Gray Coach to Étretat and Fécamp and there is VTNI for destinations in the Seine valley and Rouen who provide inter-urban services on behalf of the Department of Seine-Maritime. Finally, the company AirPlus provides a shuttle service to the railway stations and airports of Paris.

For air transport, there is Le Havre Octeville Airport which is located north of Le Havre at the town of Octeville-sur-Mer and managed by CODAH.

The main destination is the Transport hub of Lyon. Many holiday destinations are offered each year (Tunisia, Balearic Islands, Portugal, Greece, Bulgaria, etc.) through local travel agencies that charter aircraft. There is also the Flying club Jean Maridor at the airport.

The Channel maritime links with Portsmouth in southern England with P&amp;O Ferries ended on 30 September 2005 to be taken over by LD Lines who had changed the configuration. Two services to Portsmouth are provided daily from the Terminal de la Citadelle until ceasing operations in 2014, the route has since been taken over by Brittany Ferries. The link to Ireland was moved to the port of Cherbourg.

Crossing times to Portsmouth vary from five hours and thirty minutes to eight hours. Popular alternative routes going to areas close to Le Havre include Newhaven to Dieppe, and Poole to Cherbourg.

===Urban transport===


The city and the metropolitan area has a dense transport network. This solves the problem of a break between the lower town and the upper town and the two parts of the city are connected by long boulevards, winding roads, many stairs, a funicular, and finally the Jenner tunnel.

The CODAH transport network is called &quot;Lia&quot; and is operated by the &quot;Ocean Port Transport company&quot; (CTPO), a subsidiary of Veolia Transport. The overhaul of the bus network in 2008 helped to ensure a better service for all the towns in the metropolitan area. The CTPO operates a bus network consisting of 19 regular urban routes and six evening routes called the &quot;Midnight Bus&quot;. The Le Havre urban area is served by 165 vehicles and 41 regular bus routes with an average of 100,000 passengers per day. From January 2011 there has been a regular shuttle service specific to the Industrial Zone and Port of Le Havre, thus adding to the cross-estuary service of VTNI. Since 1890 the funicular has provided a link between the upper town and the lower town in four minutes with a cable car.

Le Havre had a tramway system from 1894 until it closed in 1957. More recently a new tramway system, with 23 stations and of route, was built, and opened on 12 December 2012. The first part of the line connects the beach to the station climbing to the upper town through a new tunnel near the Jenner tunnel then it splits into two: one link going to Mont-Gaillard, the other to Caucriauville.

Finally, since 2001 Le Havre agglomeration has operated the LER, a TER line connecting the Le Havre station to Rolleville passing through five other SNCF railway stations of the urban area.

From 2005, development work for Segregated cycle facilities have increased including a connection to the Greenway which promises to be an important network of quality. Between 2007 and 2011, the total length of cycle paths has doubled to in total length. It is possible to rent bicycles through agencies of the Océane bus or from the town hall (Vel-H) which has them on hand. Finally, 140 taxis work in Le Havre and serve 25 stations.

==Politics and administration==
Le Havre is one of two sub-prefectures of Seine-Maritime and the second largest subprefecture in France after Reims. It is the capital of the Arrondissement of Le Havre which includes 168 communes. It is also the largest member of the Le Havre Seine Métropole.

Since 2015, the city of Le Havre is divided over six Cantons, some of which also cover neighbouring communes. For the parliamentary elections, Le Havre spans two constituencies: the seventh (former cantons I, V, VI, and VII) and the eighth (former cantons II, III, IV, VIII, IX).

===Political trends and results===
Several politicians have spent part of their lives in the city: Jules Lecesne (1818–1878), Jules Siegfried (1837–1922), and Félix Faure (1841–1899) were elected as municipal councillors and MPs. A pool, a shopping centre and a street have been named after René Coty from Le Havre, who served as President of the French Republic from 1954 to 1959. Christine Lagarde (born 1956) attended high schools in Le Havre before becoming Minister of the Economy and Director-General of the International Monetary Fund in 2011.

Since 23 October 2010 the mayor has been Édouard Philippe (UMP). He also holds the presidency of the CODAH and has held a seat in the National Assembly for the 7th district of Seine-Maritime since 2012. He succeeded Antoine Rufenacht (UMP), who was mayor of Le Havre for fifteen years before resigning, as the head of the municipality. The city of Le Havre has long been the strongest bastion of the Communist Party of France, who directed it from 1956 to 1995. Overall, the inhabitants of Le Havre in the 7th electoral district (city centre and western neighbourhoods) tend to vote for the right while those of the 8th electoral district (eastern neighbourhoods) tend to choose the candidate of the left. For example, in the presidential election of 2007, the 7th electoral district voted for Nicolas Sarkozy (UMP) by 55.05% against 44.95% for Ségolène Royal (PS) while in the 8th electoral district 55.02% voted for the Socialist candidate. However, the results of the 2012 presidential elections gave the PS wins in both districts with a smaller margin in the 7th (Hollande: 51.71% / Sarkozy: 48.29%) than in the 8th (Hollande 64.21% / Sarkozy: 35.79%).

===Municipal administration===
The number of inhabitants in Le Havre is between 150,000 and 199,999 so the number of councillors is 59 members. The mayor, 41 aldermen and 17 deputies form the council of Le Havre elected in 2008. It meets on average once a month at the town hall. The debates are generally public except for certain proceedings.

Le Havre has experienced many territorial extensions by annexing neighbouring communes:
*1852: Ingouville and parts of Graville-l&#x27;Eure and Sanvic
*1919: all of Graville-Sainte-Honorine
*1953: Bleville
*1955: all of Sanvic
*1971: part of Harfleur (a district of Caucriauville)
*1973: Rouelles (with the status of associated commune, 3,184 inhabitants in 2006)

===Mayors===


===Public institutions and services===
The Le Havre Palace of Justice is located on the Boulevard de Strasbourg. With its annex, it includes a high court, a juvenile court, and a commercial court. The city also has a Labour Court and District Court. Among the legal services offered there are legal aid services and the application of penalties. Le Havre depends on the Court of Appeal of Rouen. The prison, which dates from the Second Empire, was completely destroyed in 2012. The new prison for Le Havre was completed in 2010 at Saint-Aubin-Routot east of the Le Havre agglomeration. It has an area of 32,000 m2 on a site of 15 hectares and can accommodate 690 people.

The &quot;Hospital Group of Havre&quot; is a public health facility managed by a supervisory board chaired by the Mayor of Le Havre. Its main structures are Flaubert Hospital (the oldest, located downtown), the Monod Hospital (in Montivilliers), the Pierre Janet Hospital (psychiatry), the house for adolescents, day hospitals, and seniors&#x27; residences. It is the largest employer in the CODAH. Built in 1987, the Jacques Monod Hospital offers a full range of care in medicine, surgery, gynecology, obstetrics, pediatrics, geriatrics, mental health follow-up care, rehabilitation, reintegration, and public health.

Finally, there are several private clinics that offer complete care: the private clinic of the Estuary groups together the old clinics of &quot;Petit Colmoulins&quot; and François I. The private clinic of Ormeaux is located in the neighbourhood of Eure.

During the first half of the 20th century, the 129th regiment of infantry of the line was stationed at Le Havre and left an important mark on the city so a street was named after them. The 74th Infantry Regiment of commandos was present from 1963 to 1976. Finally, Le Havre is the godmother city for BPC Mistral. The ceremony was held at the City Hall on 15 November 2009, during a stopover at the Building.

=== National politics ===
For elections to the National Assembly, Le Havre is divided between Seine-Maritime&#x27;s 7th and 8th constituency. They are currently represented by Agnès Firmin-Le Bodo and Jean-Paul Lecoq.

==Twin towns and sister cities==

Le Havre is twinned with:

* Dalian, China
* Magdeburg, Germany
* Saint Petersburg, Russia
* Southampton, England, United Kingdom
* Tampa, United States
==Demographics==
Le Havre experienced a population boom in the second half of the 19th century. Subsequently, the population drain of the First World War was offset by the annexation of the town of Graville (the city gained 27,215 people between 1911 and 1921). During the Second World War the population decreased significantly (a loss of 57,149 people between 1936 and 1946) because of the exodus and bombings. After the war the commune saw its population increase until 1975. Since then population has decreased again, especially between 1975 and 1982: during these years of industrial crisis the population fell by 18,494 people. The trend continued in the 1980s although at a slower pace. The current policy of the municipality is to build new housing to attract new residents with the goal of exceeding 200,000 inhabitants, a level that was reached in the 1960s. The population of the commune of Le Havre was 191,000 inhabitants in 1999 which placed the city at 12th place among the most populated cities in France and in the first place in Normandy. In 2018 INSEE counted 169,733 people living in the commune of Le Havre, while the urban area of Le Havre had 234,945 inhabitants and the metropolitan area of Le Havre had 337,086 inhabitants.


Between 2012 and 2017, the birth rate was 14.3 per thousand and the mortality rate was 10.4 per thousand: even though the Rate of natural increase is positive it does not compensate for the clearly negative net migration rate (-0.7%). In 2017 19% of Le Havre&#x27;s population was under 15 years old and 39% were under 30 years old, which was above the average for metropolitan France. 24% of men and 26% of women were over 60 years old. The most populous quarters are the city centre, Sanvic, Caucriauville, Anatole France/Danton and Côte Ouest/Ormeaux. In 2009 the foreign population was estimated at 8,525 persons or 4.8% of the population. 12,148 immigrants lived in Havre, or 6.8% of the urban population. Most had North African (5060) or African (3114) origins.

With the economic changes that have affected the city, the &quot;Professions and Socio-professional categories&quot; (PCS) have changed dramatically since the 1980s: between 1982 and 1999, the number of workers has declined by about a third (−10,593), their share of the active labour force was 16% in 1982 and 12.5% in 1999. The population of workers is concentrated in the southern suburbs close to the port and the industrial zone. At the same time the numbers of executives and intellectual professions increased by 24.5%, which is explained in part by the creation and development of the University of Le Havre. In 2017 the city had a lower proportion of managers and intellectual occupations than the national average (14.4% against 18.1%). The proportion of workers (22.5%) was higher than the national average (19.9%). Going from 16.7% to 21.7% of the labour force, the rate of unemployment has increased between 2007 and 2017, and it remains higher than in the rest of the country (13.9%). The proportion Le Havre people in short-term employment (CDD and interim work) is higher than the national average. Finally, the proportion of Le Havre people with a degree from higher education dramatically increased from 17.3% in 2007 to 23.2% in 2017 against 29.9% for entire France.
==Economy==

===General===
Although well developed and diversified, the local economy relies heavily on industrial sites, international groups, and subcontracted SMEs. The Le Havre economy is far from decision centres which are located mainly in Paris and major European economic cities. There is therefore a low representation of head offices in the city with the exception of some local economic successes such as the Sidel Group (now a subsidiary of Tetra Pak) – a distributor of interior furniture, and the ship-owner Delmas which was recently acquired by the CMA-CGM group.

===Port===

With 68.6 million tons of cargo in 2011, the port of Le Havre is the second largest French seaport in trade volume behind that of Marseille and 50th largest port in the world. It represents 60% of total French container traffic with nearly 2.2 million Twenty-foot equivalent unit|EVP]s in 2011. At the European level, it is eighth largest for container traffic and sixth largest for total traffic. The Port receives a large number of oil tankers that transported 27.5 million tonnes of crude oil and 11.7 million tonnes of refined product in 2011. Finally, 340,500 vehicles passed through the Roll-on/roll-off terminal in 2010. 75 regular shipping lines serve 500 ports around the world. The largest trading partner of the port of Le Havre is the Asian continent which alone accounts for 58% of imports by container and 39.6% of exports. The rest of the traffic is distributed mainly to Europe and America.

Le Havre occupies the north bank of the estuary of the Seine on the Channel. Its location is favourable for several reasons: it is on the most frequented waterway in the world; it is the first and last port in the &quot;North Range&quot; of European ports – the largest in Europe which handles a quarter of all global maritime trade. As a deepwater port, it is accessible to all types of ships whatever their size around the clock. At the national level, Le Havre is west of the most populous and richest region in France: Île-de-France. Since its founding in 1517 on the orders of François I, Le Havre has continued to grow: today it measures from east to west, about from north to south with an area of . The last big project called Port 2000 increased the handling capacity for containers.

The port provides 16,000 direct jobs to the Le Havre region, to which must be added indirect jobs in industry and transport. With approximately 3,000 employees in 2006, the activities of distribution and warehousing provide more jobs, followed by road transport (2,420 jobs) and handling (2,319 jobs).

In 2011, 715,279 passengers passed through the port of Le Havre and there were 95 visits by cruise ships carrying 185,000 passengers. The port expects 110 cruise ship calls in 2012. Created in 1934, the leisure boat harbour of Le Havre is located to the west and is the largest French boat harbour in the Channel with a capacity of 1,160 moorings. Finally, there is a small fishing port in the Saint-François district and a Hawker centre.

===Industry===
Most industries are located in the industrial-port area north of the estuary and east of the city of Le Havre. The largest industrial employer (2,400 employees) of the Le Havre region is the Renault public company in the commune of Sandouville. The second important sector for the industrial zone is petrochemicals. The Le Havre region has more than a third of French refining capacity. It provides about 50% of the production of basic plastics and 80% of additives and oils with more than 3,500 researchers working in private and public laboratories. Large firms in the chemical industry are mainly in the communes of Le Havre (Millenium Chemicals Le Havre), Montivilliers (TotalEnergies, Yara, Chevron Oronite SA, Lanxess, etc.) and Sandouville (Goodyear Chemicals Europe). A total of 28 industrial establishments manufacture plastics in the Le Havre area many of which are classed as SECESO. 

There are several firms in the aerospace industry: SAFRAN Nacelles, a supplier to Airbus, Boeing and other commercial air-framers, making jet engine nacelles and thrust reversers, is located in Harfleur and employs 1,200 people from the Le Havre area. Finally, Dresser-Rand SA manufactures equipment for the oil and gas industry and employs about 700 people. In the energy field, the &quot;EDF thermal power plant&quot; of Le Havre has an installed capacity of 1,450MW and operates using coal with 357 employees. The AREVA group announced the opening of a factory for building wind turbines: installed in the port of Le Havre, it should create some 1,800 jobs. The machines are designed for Offshore wind power in Brittany, the UK, and Normandy.

Other industries are dispersed throughout the Le Havre agglomeration: the &quot;Brûlerie du Havre&quot;, which belongs to Legal-Legoût, located in the district of Dollemard that roasts coffee, Sidel located both in the industrial area of Port of Le Havre and Octeville-sur-Mer designs and manufactures blow moulding machines and complete filling line machines for plastic bottles.

===Services sector===
The two largest employers in the service sector are the &quot;Groupe Hospitalier du Havre&quot; with 4,384 staff and the &quot;City of Le Havre&quot; with 3,467 permanent employees. The city has long been home to many service companies whose activity is related to port operations: primarily the ship-owning companies and also the marine insurance companies. The headquarters of Delmas (transport and communications, 1,200 employees) and SPB (Provident Society Banking, insurance, 500 employees) have settled recently at the entrance to the city. The head office of Groupama Transport (300 employees) is also present.

The transport sector is the largest economic sector in Le Havre with 15.5% of employment. Logistics occupies a large part of the population and the ISEL trains engineers in this field. Since September 2007 the ICC has welcomed local students in their first year in the relocated Europe-Asia campus of the Institute of Political Studies of Paris. Higher Education is represented by the University of Le Havre which employs 399 permanent professors and 850 lecturers as well as by engineering companies like Auxitec and SERO.

There are many growth factors in the tourist industry: blue flag rating, World Heritage status from UNESCO, the label &quot;French Towns and Lands of Art and History&quot;, cruise ship development, a policy of value-creation from heritage, and the &quot;City of the Sea&quot; project. In January 2020 the city had 26 hotels with a total of 1,428 rooms.

Le Havre is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Le Havre. It manages the Le Havre Octeville Airport.

Since 1 June 2006 a &quot;Biennale of contemporary Art&quot; has been organized by the group &quot;Partouche&quot;.

===Cultural heritage and architecture===

Many buildings in the city are classified as &quot;historical monuments&quot;, but the 2000s marked the real recognition of Le Havre&#x27;s architectural heritage. The city received the label &quot;City of Art and History&quot; in 2001, then in 2005 UNESCO inscribed the city of Le Havre as a World Heritage Site.

The oldest building still standing in Le Havre is the Graville Abbey. The other medieval building in the city is the Chapel of Saint-Michel of Ingouville. Because of the bombing in 1944, heritage from the modern era is rare: &quot;Le Havre Cathedral&quot;, the &quot;Church of Saint Francis&quot;, the &quot;Museum of the Hotel Dubocage of Bleville&quot;, the &quot;House of the ship-owner&quot; and the old palace of justice (now the &quot;Natural History Museum&quot;) are concentrated in the Notre-Dame and Saint-François areas. The buildings of the 19th century testify to the maritime and military vocations of the city: the &quot;Hanging Gardens&quot;, the &quot;Fort of Tourneville&quot;, &quot;Vauban docks&quot;, and the &quot;Maritime Villa&quot;. The heritage of the 1950s and 1960s which were the work of the Auguste Perret workshop forms the most coherent architecture: the &quot;Church of Saint Francis&quot; and the Town Hall are the centrepieces. The all curved architecture of the &quot;Volcano&quot;, designed by Oscar Niemeyer, contrasts with that of the rebuilt centre. Finally, the reconstruction of many districts is a showcase for the architecture of the 21st century. Among the achievements by renowned architects are the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (René and Phine Weeke Dottelond), Les Bains Des Docks (Jean Nouvel).

===Museums===
Five Museums in Le Havre have the distinction of being classified as &quot;Musées de France&quot; (Museums of France) an official label granted only to museums of a high status. The five museums are:

====Museum of modern art André Malraux – MuMa====

The most important of the five, Museum Malraux was built in 1955 by the Atelier LWD and was opened in 1961 by André Malraux. This museum houses a collection of art from the late Middle Ages until the 20th century.

====Musée d&#x27;histoire naturelle (Museum of Natural History)====
Founded in 1881 but heavily damaged during World War II, the Museum of Natural History is housed in Le Havre&#x27;s former law courts, built in the mid-18th century; the façade and monumental staircase are listed as historical monuments. The museum houses mineralogy, zoology, ornithology, palaeontology and prehistory departments as well as 8,000 early 19th-century paintings from the collection of local naturalist and traveller Charles-Alexandre Lesueur (1778–1846). The museum was destroyed during Allied bombings on 5 September 1944. The library was lost, along with its collections of photographs, scientific instruments and archives. The mineral and geological collections were all destroyed, including a rare collection of local mineral specimens of Normandy. The destruction of the museum was so intense, that all the catalogues, lists of donations, lists of purchases and other archives prevented even a precise inventory of all that was lost.&quot;

====The Shipowner&#x27;s house====
From the 18th century; like the Museum of Old Havre it is dedicated to the History of Le Havre and contains many relics from the Ancien Régime as well as furniture, old maps, statues, and paintings.

It was scheduled to open in September 2013 with a large festival free-of-charge. It will consist of two halls with 800 and 200 seats, exhibition space, housing for artists in residence, a restaurant etc. &quot;Le Tetris&quot; will be a venue for contemporary music as well as theatre, dance, and visual arts. An &quot;expectation&quot; outside the walls was held on the site of the fort during 2012 and early 2013. 

===Libraries and archives===
The main library is located in the city centre, named after the writer Armand Salacrou. It has branches in all districts. A new multimedia library at the &quot;Volcano&quot; is being refurbished for 2014.

Medieval manuscripts and Incunables are conserved at the public library. The archives of the city, at the Fort of Tourneville, possesses documents from the 16th to the 20th centuries.

===Representations in visual arts===
The Port of Le Havre and the light on the estuary of the Seine inspired many painters: Louis-Philippe Crepin (1772–1851), Jean-Baptiste Corot (1796–1875), Eugène Isabey (1803–1886), Theodore Gudin (1802–1880), Adolphe-Felix Cals (1810–1880), Jean-François Millet (1814–1875) in 1845, Gustave Courbet (1819–1877) etc.. It is to Eugène Boudin (1824–1898) who created many representations of Le Havre in the 19th century. The artist lived for a time in the city. Thanks to its proximity to Honfleur, Le Havre was also represented by foreign artists such as William Turner, Johan Barthold Jongkind, Alfred Stevens, and Richard Parkes Bonington.

Claude Monet (1840–1926), a resident of Le Havre from the age of five, in 1872 painted &quot;Impression soleil levant&quot; (Impression, Sunrise), a painting that gave its name to the impressionist movement. In 1867–1868, he painted many seascapes in the Le Havre region (&quot;Terrasse à Sainte-Adresse&quot; (Garden at Sainte-Adresse), 1867 &quot;Bateaux quittant le port&quot; (Boats Leaving the Port), 1874). The Musée Malraux houses some of his paintings : Waterlilies, London Parliament et Winter Sun at Lavacourt. Two other Impressionists, Camille Pissarro (1830–1903) and Maxime Maufra (1861–1918) also represented the port of Le Havre which also inspired Paul Signac (1863–1935), Albert Marquet (1875–1947), and Maurice de Vlaminck (1876–1958).

Then came the school of Fauvism in which many artists did their training at Le Havre: Othon Friesz (1879–1949), Henri de Saint-Delis (1876–1958), Raoul Dufy (1877–1953), Georges Braque (1882–1963), Raymond Lecourt (1882–1946), Albert Copieux (1885–1956), who followed the course of the &quot;School of Fine Arts of Le Havre&quot; in the time of Charles Lhuillier. They left a number of paintings on the theme of the city and the port. In 1899, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864–1901) painted &quot;La serveuse anglaise du Star&quot; (The English waitress of Star) (Museum Toulouse-Lautrec, Albi) of a girl he met in a bar in the city.

Alphonse Allais located his intrigues at Le Havre too. (The Human Beast) by Émile Zola evokes the world of the railway and runs along the Paris–Le Havre railway. Streets, buildings, and public places in Le Havre pay tribute to other famous Le Havre people from this period: the writer Casimir Delavigne (1793–1843) has a street named after him and a statue in front of the palace of justice alongside another man of letters, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1737–1814).

In the 20th century, Henry Miller located part of the action in Le Havre in his masterpiece &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, published in 1934.

Two famous historians, Gabriel Monod (1844–1912) and André Siegfried (1875–1959) were from the city.

Le Havre also appears in comic books: for example, in &quot;L&#x27;Oreille cassée&quot; (The Broken Ear) (1937), Tintin embarks on the vessel &quot;City of Lyon&quot; sailing to South America. The meeting between Tintin and General Alcazar in &quot;Les Sept Boules de cristal&quot; (The Seven Crystal Balls) (1948) is in Le Havre, according to notes by Hergé in the margins of Le Soir, the first publisher of this adventure.

Le Havre has long been regarded as one of the cradles of French rock and blues. In the 1980s many groups have emerged after a first dynamic development in the 1960s and 1970s. The most famous personality of Le Havre rock is &quot;Little Bob&quot; who began his career in the 1970s. The port tradition in many of the groups was repeated in the unused sheds of the port, such as Bovis hall which could hold 20,000 spectators. A blues festival, driven by Jean-François Skrobek, Blues a Gogo existed for eight years from 1995 to 2002. Several artists have been produced such as: Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Popa Chubby, Amadou &amp; Mariam, Patrick Verbeke etc. It was organized by the Coup de Bleu association whose former president was head of music Café &quot;L&#x27;Agora&quot; in the Niemeyer Centre which produced the new Le Havre scene. During these same years, the &quot;Festival of the Future&quot;, the local version of the &quot;Fête de l&#x27;Humanité&quot; (Festival of Humanity), attracted a large audience.

Currently, the musical tradition continues in the Symphony Orchestra of the city of Le Havre, the orchestra of Concerts André Caplet, the conservatory, and music schools such as the Centre for Vocal and Musical Expression (rock) or the JUPO (mainly jazz), associations or labels like Papa&#x27;s Production (la Folie Ordinaire, Mob&#x27;s et Travaux, Dominique Comont, Souinq, Your Happy End etc.).

Opened in 1986, the University of Le Havre is recent, medium-sized and well located: the largest campus is virtually in the centre of the city near railway and tram stations. The campus includes a University Library (2006), a gym, several dining halls with student housing, a structure incorporating a theatre, an orientation service, and student associations. In 2010–2011, 6,914 students were enrolled including 5,071 undergraduates, 1,651 Masters students, and 192 postgraduate students.

The University Institutes of Technology of Le Havre occupies two main sites: one in the upper town in the Caucriauville-Rouelles district which was opened in 1967 and another in the Eure district since 2011. The IUT has a total of 1,881 students divided into ten departments preparing for the DUT.

In addition there is a large number of specialized higher education institutions covering a wide range of different areas. Founded in 1871, the &quot;École Supérieure de Commerce du Havre&quot;, one of the oldest in France, has merged with &quot;Sup Europe&quot; and &quot;l&#x27;IPER&quot; to create the &quot;Normandy Business School&quot; in 2006. This school had over 2,800 students on its five campuses (Le Havre, Caen, Deauville, Oxford and Paris) in 2015. Since the 2007 school year, the Institute of Political Studies of Paris opened a Euro-Asia cycle in Le Havre. The &quot;National School of The Merchant Marine&quot; trains Officers of the First Class for the Merchant Marine: currently located at Sainte-Adresse, it will move to the &quot;Bassin Vauban&quot; in 2015 in a building that will house 1,000 students. The National Higher School of Petrol and Motors (ENSPM) is a school for specialist petroleum engineers, petrochemists, and engine makers.

Finally 800 people study in paramedical and social schools mostly in the IFSI (Institute of Training in Nursing) which has approximately 600 students.

==Sports==
The city of Le Havre has some of the oldest sports clubs in France: the &quot;Le Havre Rowing Society&quot; (1838), the &quot;Regatta Society of Le Havre&quot; (1838), and &quot;Le Havre Athletic Club&quot; (1872), doyen of French football and rugby clubs.

The city also hosted the sailing events for the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics, respectively.

Le Havre is dominated by three professional sports teams: the first is the Le Havre AC football team who were relegated from Ligue 1 after the 2008–2009 season but gained promotion back to Ligue 1 in 2023. Its training centre is well-reputed for having trained a number of international French players, including Vikash Dhorasoo, Julien Faubert, Jean-Alain Boumsong, Lassana Diarra, and Steve Mandanda. The second major sports team is Saint Thomas Basketball who represent the city in LNB Pro A. Thirdly the HAC women&#x27;s team who play in the first division with many international players in its ranks. The team won their first major national title, the Coupe de France for women&#x27;s handball in 2006. &quot;Le Havre Rugby athletic club&quot; plays in Fédérale 3 (equivalent to fifth division). The Hockey Club of Le Havre played at the fourth level nationally (Division 3) for the 2008–2009 season. The team is nicknamed the &quot;Dock&#x27;s du Havre&quot;.

The maritime side of the city is found in many sports: for example, the tradition of sailing is old. On 29 July 1840 the first French pleasure boat regatta was held. Today, Le Havre is known as a water sports and Seaside resort. The marina can host deepwater vessels around the clock in any weather. Built in the Interwar period, it is now the largest in Seine-Maritime with about 1,300 moorings additional moorings were installed in the Vauban basin in 2011–2012. The &quot;Havraise Rowing Society&quot; has trained many rowers to a high level as Thierry Renault. The &quot;Club Nautique Le Havrais&quot; (CNH) is the centre of mixed swimming, synchronized swimming, and men&#x27;s water polo. The &quot;Centre Nautique Paul Vatine&quot; is the fifth largest club in the country for the number of sports licenses it holds; it ranks second in the Division 1 of the Championship France for Catamaran Clubs.

Several major local sportsmen began their career at Le Havre: the swimmer Hugues Duboscq was an Olympic medallist several times. In judo the French team has two members from Le Havre: Dimitri Dragin and Baptiste Leroy. Jerome Le Banner is a professional kick-boxer at world level who participates in the K-1 championship. Finally the navigator Paul Vatine, who was lost at sea in 1999, won the Transat Jacques Vabre several times.

The city has 99 sports facilities including 46 gymnasiums, 23 sports fields, and 5 swimming pools. The Stade Océane (Ocean Stadium), inaugurated in July 2012, replaced the Stade Jules Deschaseaux. With 25,000 seats, it can host football matches as well as other sporting and cultural events. Basketball and Handball matches are playued in the Dock Océane hall (3600 seats) while ice hockey is played at the ice hockey rink (900 seats). Of the five swimming pools in the city, two are operated by the municipality: the CNH (which has an Olympic pool for competitions) and Les Bains Des Docks (which was designed by the architect Jean Nouvel). Le Havre has the largest free outdoor skatepark in France with approximately 7,000 m2 allocated to the urban Boardsport. The port infrastructure allows for many water activities such as sailing, fishing, canoeing, and rowing. Finally, the beach is a place for kitesurfing, windsurfing and surfing.

Le Havre has been and is still the venue of major sports events: the Tour de France has passed a dozen times by the Ocean Gate, the last stage took place here in 2015. Sailing events are often held and the Transat Jacques Vabre transatlantic race has been held every two years since 1993 linking Le Havre to Latin America. The course of the Solitaire du Figaro was partly in Le Havre in 2010. Since 2006, weekends of freestyle board sports have been popular (skateboarding, rollerblading, funboard, kiteboarding, skydiving etc.). Every summer roller blade events are organized in the city on Friday evening every fortnight and have great success. The first International Triathlon was held in 2012. Finally, there are several opportunities for runners with ten kilometres () in Le Havre or the strides of Montgeon.

A free weekly of information, &quot;Le Havre Infos&quot; (PubliHebdo group) has been published since 2010 every Wednesday and is available in many places in the city.

Several magazines provide local information: &quot;LH Océanes&quot; (Municipal magazine) and &quot;Terres d&#x27;Agglo&quot; (Agglomeration Area magazine) to which must be added several free magazines: &quot;Aux Arts&quot; (cultural information more focused on the Basse-Normandie region) &quot;Bazart&quot; (cultural events in Le Havre but now with circulation across all of Normandy), and &quot;HAC Magazine&quot; (news about HAC).

===Religion===
At the request of Monsigneur André Mulch, Archbishop of Rouen, Pope Paul VI decided on 6 July 1974 through the papal bull &quot;Quae Sacrosanctum&quot; on the creation of the diocese of Le Havre (&quot;Portus Gratiae&quot; in Latin meaning &quot;Port of Grace&quot;). The diocese was created from part of the parishes of the Archdiocese of Rouen to the west of a line joining Norville to Sassetot-le-Mauconduit. Monseigneur Michel Saudreau, its first bishop, was ordained on 22 September 1974. The church of Notre Dame was promoted to Cathedral Notre Dame du Havre. Today, the commune of Le Havre is divided into eight parishes and 24 places of worship (churches and chapels). The oldest chapel is Saint-Michel d&#x27;Ingouville which dates back to the 11th century. The Church of Saint Joseph du Havre, built by Auguste Perret, dominates the city with its spire 107m high. There are several monastic establishments (Carmel of the Transfiguration, Franciscan Monastery, Little Sisters of the Poor, etc.).

The Protestant Church of Le Havre was built in the city centre in 1862. Bombed in 1941, it lost its pediment, its bell tower, and roof. Rebuilt in 1953 by the architects Jacques Lamy and Gérard Dupasquier, who worked in the Auguste Perret office, is the only building in Le Havre uniting the original architecture of the 19th century with the architecture of the Perret school. Le Havre also has seven evangelical Protestant churches: &quot;Salvation Army&quot;, &quot;Seventh Day Adventist&quot;, &quot;Apostolic Church&quot;, &quot;Assembly of God&quot;, &quot;Baptist Church&quot;, &quot;Good News Church&quot;, et &quot;Church of Le Havre&quot; as well as several Protestant churches of African origin.

The city also has seven Muslim places of worship: the socio-cultural association of Muslims in Upper Normandy, En-Nour Mosque on Rue Paul Claudel, El Fath Mosque on rue Victor Hugo, Bellevue mosque on rue Gustavus Brindeau, and three prayer rooms located on rue Audran, Boulevard Jules Durant, and rue Lodi. The synagogue, located in the rebuilt central city, was visited by President Jacques Chirac in April 2002. It is the seat of the &quot;association consistoriale israélite du Havre&quot; whose president is Victor Elgressy.

<text>The Seine ( , ) is a river in northern France. Its drainage basin is in the Paris Basin (a geological relative lowland) covering most of northern France. It rises at Source-Seine, northwest of Dijon in northeastern France in the Langres plateau, flowing through Paris and into the English Channel at Le Havre (and Honfleur on the left bank). It is navigable by ocean-going vessels as far as Rouen, from the sea. Over 60 percent of its length, as far as Burgundy, is negotiable by large barges and most tour boats, and nearly its whole length is available for recreational boating; excursion boats offer sightseeing tours of the river banks in the capital city, Paris.
There are 37 bridges in Paris across the Seine (the most famous of which are the Pont Alexandre III and the Pont Neuf) and dozens more outside the city. A notable bridge, which is also the last along the course of the river, is the Pont de Normandie, the ninth longest cable-stayed bridge in the world, which links Le Havre and Honfleur.

== River sources ==
The Seine rises in the commune of Source-Seine, about northwest of Dijon. The source has been owned by the city of Paris since 1864. A number of closely associated small ditches or depressions provide the source waters, with an artificial grotto laid out to highlight and contain a deemed main source. The grotto includes a statue of a nymph, a dog, and a dragon. On the same site are the buried remains of a Gallo-Roman temple. Small statues of the &quot;dea Sequana&quot; &quot;Seine goddess&quot; and other ex-votos found at the same place are now exhibited in the Dijon archaeological museum.

== Course ==
The Seine can artificially be divided into five parts:
* the &quot;Petite Seine&quot;, &quot;Small Seine&quot; from the sources to Montereau-Fault-Yonne
* the &quot;Haute Seine&quot;, &quot;Upper Seine&quot; from Montereau-Fault-Yonne to Paris
* the &quot;Traversée de Paris&quot;, &quot;the Paris waterway&quot;
* the &quot;Basse Seine&quot;, &quot;Lower Seine&quot; from Paris to Rouen
* the &quot;Seine maritime&quot;, &quot;Maritime Seine&quot; from Rouen to the English channel.

Below Rouen, the river passes through the &quot;Parc Naturel Régional des Boucles de la Seine Normande&quot;, a French regional nature park.

==Navigation==
The Seine is dredged and ocean-going vessels can dock at Rouen, from the sea. Commercial craft (barges and push-tows) can use the river beginning at Marcilly-sur-Seine, to its mouth.

At Paris, there are 37 bridges. The river is only above sea level from its mouth, making it slow flowing and thus easily navigable.

The Seine Maritime, from the English Channel at Le Havre to Rouen, is the only portion of the Seine used by ocean-going craft. The tidal section of the Seine Maritime is followed by a canalized section (&quot;Basse Seine&quot;) with four large multiple locks until the mouth of the Oise at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine (). Smaller locks at Bougival and at Suresnes lift the vessels to the level of the river in Paris, where the junction with the Canal Saint-Martin is located. The distance from the mouth of the Oise is .

The &quot;Haute Seine&quot;, from Paris to Montereau-Fault-Yonne, is long and has 8 locks. At Charenton-le-Pont is the mouth of the Marne. Upstream from Paris seven locks ensure navigation to Saint Mammès, where the Loing mouth is situated. Through an eighth lock the river Yonne is reached at Montereau-Fault-Yonne. From the mouth of the Yonne, larger ships can continue upstream to Nogent-sur-Seine (, 7 locks). From there on, the river is navigable only by small craft to Marcilly-sur-Seine (, 4 locks). At Marcilly-sur-Seine the 19th century Canal de la Haute-Seine used to allow vessels to continue all the way to Troyes. This canal has been abandoned since 1957.

The Seine&#x27;s average depth in Paris today is approximately 9.5 meters (31 feet). Until locks were installed to raise the level in the 1800s, the river was much shallower within the city, and consisted of a small channel of continuous flow bordered by sandy banks (depicted in many illustrations of the period). Today the depth is tightly controlled and the entire width of the river between the built-up banks on either side is normally filled with water. The average flow of the river is very low, only a few cubic metres per second, but much higher flows are possible during periods of heavy runoff.

=== Dredging ===

Dredging in the 1960s mostly eliminated tidal bores on the lower river, known in French as &quot;le mascaret.&quot;

==Dams and flood control==
Four large storage reservoirs have been built since 1950 on the Seine as well as its tributaries Yonne, Marne, and Aube. These help in maintaining a constant level for the river through the city, but cannot prevent significant increases in river level during periods of extreme runoff. The dams are Lac d’Orient, Lac des Settons, Lake Der-Chantecoq, and Auzon-Temple and Amance, respectively.

===Flooding===
A very severe period of high water in January 1910 resulted in extensive flooding throughout the city of Paris. The Seine again rose to threatening levels in 1924, 1955, 1982, 1999–2000, June 2016, and January 2018. After a first-level flood alert in 2003, about 100,000 works of art were moved out of Paris, the largest relocation of art since World War II. Much of the art in Paris is kept in underground storage rooms that would have been flooded.

A 2002 report by the French government stated the worst-case Seine flood scenario would cost 10 billion euros and cut telephone service for a million Parisians, leaving 200,000 without electricity and 100,000 without gas.

===2018 Paris flood===
In January 2018 the Seine again flooded, reaching a flood level of on 29 January. An official warning was issued on 24 January that heavy rainfall was likely to cause the river to flood. By 27 January, the river was rising. The Deputy Mayor of Paris Colombe Brossel warned that the heavy rain was caused by climate change. He added that &quot;We have to understand that climatic change is not a word, it&#x27;s a reality.&quot;

==Watershed==
The basin area, including a part of Belgium, is , 2 percent of which is forest and 78 percent cultivated land. In addition to Paris, three other cities with a population over 100,000 are in the Seine watershed: Le Havre at the estuary, Rouen in the Seine valley and Reims at the northern limit—with an annual urban growth rate of 0.2 percent. The population density is 201 per square kilometer.

==Water quality==
Due to concentrated levels of industry, agriculture and urban populations of Paris and its surroundings, the Seine-Normandy watershed experiences the highest human impacts of any hydrographic basin in France. Compared to most other large European rivers, the ability of the Seine to dilute urban sewage and farmland runoff is very low. Low oxygen levels, high concentrations of ammonia, nitrites and faecal bacteria, extending from Paris to the estuary, have been issues for over a century. The advent of nitrogenous fertilizers in the 1960s marked an upturn in agricultural pollution due to land use changes that had previously scaled with population growth. Heavy industries near Paris and along the Oise River discharged virtually untreated wastewaters from the turn of the 19th century, causing concentrations of toxins in the river that were ignored until the late 1980s. Major French laws to address water quality were passed in 1898, 1964, 1996, and 2006.

At the beginning of the 20th century, most domestic sewage was used as fertilizer for nearby croplands. As populations grew, the agricultural capacity to absorb those wastewaters was exceeded. Large-scale construction of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) began in 1940 to meet demand; however, by 1970, about 60% of urban sewage was allowed to flow into the river untreated. The resulting oxygen depletion reduced the number of fish species to three. Measures taken in the early 2000s due to the Water Framework Directive led to significant reductions of organic carbon, phosphorus and ammonium, which in turn decreased the occurrence and severity of phytoplankton blooms. Continued WWTP construction and new treatment methods improved environmental conditions. In 2009, it was announced that Atlantic salmon had returned to the Seine. By the early 2020s, the number of fish species near Paris had rebounded to 32.

Periodically the sewage systems of Paris experience a failure known as sanitary sewer overflow, often in periods of high rainfall. Under these conditions, untreated residential and industrial sewage is discharged into the Seine to prevent backflow. This is due in large part to Paris&#x27; &quot;single system&quot; drainage scheme dating from the 19th century, which combines street runoff and sewage. The resulting oxygen deficit is principally caused by allochthonous bacteria larger than one micrometre in size. The specific activity of these sewage bacteria is typically three to four times greater than that of the autochthonous (background) bacterial population. Heavy metal concentrations in the Seine are relatively high. The pH level of the Seine at Pont Neuf has been measured to be 8.46. Despite this, the water quality has improved significantly over what several historians at various times in the past called an &quot;open sewer&quot;.

In 2018, a €1.4 billion ($1.55 billion) cleanup programme called the &quot;Swimming Plan&quot; was launched with the aim of making the river safe to use for the 2024 Summer Olympics. The project included constructing a basin to store rainwater, which would then be slowly released into the sewer system, preventing overflow. Plans also call for several public swimming areas to be made available by 2025, ending a ban instituted in 1923 due to the polluted water. These efforts have produced mixed results, as &quot;E. coli&quot; levels have often been found to be far higher than what is safe to swim in, though this could depend on the season. At the same time, the fish population in the river has surged, from just two species to over 30. To demonstrate the river&#x27;s improved cleanliness, Mayor Anne Hidalgo and President Emmanuel Macron both pledged to take a swim in the waters, and Hidalgo did so on July 17, 2024.

During the Summer Olympics, the date of the triathlon was postponed due to water quality issues, as the earlier rainstorm during the opening ceremony had driven some untreated rainwater back into the Seine. However, the triathlon proceeded the following day, after testing found the water quality to be sufficient for swimming.

==History==


The name comes from Gaullish , from the Celtic Gallo-Roman goddess of the river, as offerings for her were found at the source. Sometimes it is incorrectly associated with Latin &#x27;follow&#x27;, but the Celtic word rather seems to derive from the same root as English &quot;sea&quot;, namely Proto-Indo-European &quot;*seikw-&quot;, signifying &#x27;to flow&#x27; or &#x27;to pour forth&#x27;.

On 28 or 29 March 845, an army of Vikings led by a chieftain named Reginherus, which is possibly another name for Ragnar Lothbrok, sailed up the River Seine with siege towers and sacked Paris.

On 25 November 885, another Viking expedition led by Rollo was sent up the River Seine to attack Paris again.

In March 1314, King Philip IV of France had Jacques de Molay, last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, burned on a scaffold on an island in the River Seine in front of Notre Dame de Paris.

After the burning of Joan of Arc in 1431, her ashes were thrown into the Seine from the medieval stone Mathilde Bridge at Rouen, though unsupported counter-claims persist.
On 9 August 1803 Robert Fulton, American painter and marine engineer, made his first successful test of his steamboat in the Seine beside the Tuileries Garden. Having a length of sixty-six feet and an eight-foot beam Fulton&#x27;s steamboat attained speeds of three to four miles per hour against the Seine&#x27;s current.

Reaching the Seine was one of the original objectives of Operation Overlord, during the Second World War, in 1944. The Allies&#x27; intention was to reach the Seine by 90 days after D-Day. That objective was met. An anticipated assault crossing of the river never materialized as German resistance in France crumbled by early September 1944. However, the First Canadian Army did encounter resistance immediately west of the Seine and fighting occurred in the Forêt de la Londe as Allied troops attempted to cut off the escape across the river of parts of the German 7th Army in the closing phases of the Battle of Normandy.

Some of the Algerian victims of the Paris massacre of 1961 drowned in the Seine after being thrown by French policemen from the Pont Saint-Michel and other locations in Paris.

== At the Olympics ==
===1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics ===
At the 1900 Summer Olympics, the river hosted the rowing, swimming, and water polo events. Twenty-four years later, it hosted the rowing events again at Bassin d&#x27;Argenteuil, along the Seine north of Paris.

=== 2024 Summer Olympics ===

More than a century later, during the 2024 Summer Olympics, the Seine hosted a boat parade with boats for each national delegation during the opening ceremony. 

The river was also the site of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s event for marathon swimming, as well as the swimming portion of the triathlon. Although swimming in the Seine had been banned since 1923, a €1.4 billion cleanup effort by the French government sought to reduce bacterial levels in the river to those safe for swimming. During the Olympics, daily tests of the water quality were taken to determine if it was safe for swimming; this caused the triathlon to be delayed by a day, before being allowed to proceed on July 31. A few of the triathletes who swam in the river became sick afterwards, though it was not clear if the Seine water was the cause.

== World Heritage Sites ==
In 1991 (and 2024), UNESCO added the banks of the Seine in Paris—the &quot;Rive Gauche&quot; and &quot;Rive Droite&quot;—to its list of World Heritage Sites in Europe.
== In art ==
During the 19th and the 20th centuries in particular the Seine inspired many artists, including:

* Frédéric Bazille 
* Maurice Boitel 
* Richard Parkes Bonington 
* Eugène Boudin 
* Camille Corot 
* Charles-François Daubigny 
* Guy Debord
* Raoul Dufy 
* Othon Friesz 
* Carl Fredrik Hill
* Eugène Isabey 
* Johan Barthold Jongkind 
* Albert Marquet 
* Henri Matisse
* Claude Monet 
* Luis F. Pinzón 
* Camille Pissarro 
* Emilio Grau Sala 
* Gaston Sébire 
* Georges Seurat
* Alfred Sisley
* Constant Troyon 
* J. M. W. Turner
* Félix Vallotton 
* Édouard Vuillard 
* Pierre Auguste Renoir

A song &quot;La Seine&quot; by Flavien Monod and Guy Lafarge was written in 1948.

Josephine Baker also recorded a song called &quot;La Seine&quot;

Another song titled &quot;La Seine&quot;, by Vanessa Paradis featuring Matthieu Chedid, formed part of the original soundtrack for the 2011 film &quot;A Monster in Paris&quot;.

The Seine features prominently in ABBA&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Our Last Summer&quot;, written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.

<text>A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with said person or organization, or have been paid to do so. Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, politics, sports, confidence games, cryptocurrency, or other business areas. A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest.

In most uses, &quot;shill&quot; refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, participants or &quot;marks&quot; the impression of an enthusiastic customer independent of the seller, marketer or con artist, for whom they are secretly working. The person or group in league with the shill relies on crowd psychology to encourage other onlookers or audience members to do business with the seller or accept the ideas they are promoting. Shills may be employed by salespeople and professional marketing campaigns. &quot;Plant&quot; and &quot;stooge&quot; more commonly refer to a person who is secretly in league with another person or outside organization while pretending to be neutral or part of the organization in which they are planted, such as a magician&#x27;s audience, a political party, or an intelligence organization (see double agent).

Shilling is illegal in many circumstances and under many jurisdictions because of the potential for fraud and damage. However, if a shill does not place uninformed parties at a risk of loss, the shill&#x27;s actions may be legal. For example, a person planted in an audience to laugh and applaud when desired (see claque), or to participate in on-stage activities as a &quot;random member of the audience&quot;, is a legal type of shill.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term &quot;shill&quot; is uncertain; it may be an abbreviation of &quot;shillaber&quot;. The word originally denoted a carnival worker who pretended to be a member of the audience in an attempt to elicit interest in an attraction. Some sources trace the usage back to 1914, or as far back as 1911. American humorist Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber (1814–1890), who often wrote under the guise of his fictional character Mrs. Ruth Partington, the American version of Mrs. Malaprop, is a possible source.

== Internet ==

In online discussion media, shills make posts expressing opinions that further interests of an organization in which they have a vested interest, such as a commercial vendor or special interest group, while posing as unrelated innocent parties. For example, an employee of a company that produces a specific product might praise the product anonymously in a discussion forum or group in order to generate interest in that product, service, or group. Web sites can also be set up for the same purpose. In addition, some shills use sock puppetry, where one person poses as multiple users.

In some jurisdictions and circumstances, this type of activity is illegal. The plastic surgery company Lifestyle Lift ordered their employees to post fake positive reviews on websites. As a result, they were sued, and ordered to pay $300,000 in damages by the New York Attorney General&#x27;s office.

Reputable organizations may prohibit their employees and other interested parties (contractors, agents, etc.) from participating in public forums or discussion groups in which a conflict of interest might arise, or will at least insist that their employees and agents refrain from participating in any way that might create a conflict of interest.

== Gambling ==
Both the illegal and legal gambling industries often use shills to make winning at games appear more likely than it actually is. For example, illegal three-card monte and shell-game peddlers are notorious employers of shills. These shills also often aid in cheating, disrupting the game if the &quot;mark&quot; is likely to win. In a legal casino, however, a shill is sometimes a gambler who plays using the casino&#x27;s money in order to keep games (especially poker) going when there are not enough players. The title of one of Erle Stanley Gardner&#x27;s mystery novels, &quot;Shills Can&#x27;t Cash Chips&quot;, is derived from this type of shill. This is different from &quot;proposition players&quot; who are paid a salary by the casino for the same purpose, but bet with their own money.

== Marketing ==
In marketing, shills are often employed to assume the air of satisfied customers and give testimonials to the merits of a given product. This type of shilling is illegal in some jurisdictions, but almost impossible to detect. It may be considered a form of unjust enrichment or unfair competition, as in California&#x27;s Business &amp; Professions Code § 17200, which prohibits any &quot;unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising&quot;.

== Auctions ==

People who drive prices in favor of the seller or auctioneer with fake bids in an auction are called &quot;shills&quot; or &quot;potted plants&quot; and seek to provoke a bidding war among other participants. Often they are told by the seller precisely how high to bid, as the seller does not lose money if the item does not sell, paying only the auction fees. Shilling has a substantially higher rate of occurrence in online auctions, where any user with multiple accounts can bid on their own items. One detailed example of this has been documented in online auto auctions. The online auction site eBay forbids shilling; its rules do not allow friends or employees of a person selling an item to bid on the item, even though eBay has no means to detect if a bidder is related to a seller or is in fact the seller.

In his book &quot;Fake: Forgery, Lies, &amp; eBay&quot;, Kenneth Walton describes how he and his accomplices placed shill bids on hundreds of eBay auctions over the course of a year. Walton and his associates were charged and convicted of fraud by federal authorities for their eBay shill bidding.

With the proliferation of live online auctions in recent years, shill bidding has become commonplace. Some websites allow shill bidding by participating auctioneers. These auctioneers are able to see bids placed in real time and can then place counter bids to increase the amount. One Proxibid auctioneers&#x27; website states, &quot;At the request of the auction company, this auction permits bids to be placed by the seller or on the seller&#x27;s behalf, even if such bids are placed solely for the purpose of increasing the bid.&quot;

<text>Marius Sophus Lie ( ; ; 17 December 1842 – 18 February 1899) was a Norwegian mathematician. He largely created the theory of continuous symmetry and applied it to the study of geometry and differential equations. He also made substantial contributions to the development of algebra.

== Life and career ==
Marius Sophus Lie was born on 17 December 1842 in the small town of Nordfjordeid. He was the youngest of six children born to Lutheran pastor Johann Herman Lie and his wife, who came from a well-known Trondheim family.

He had his primary education in the south-eastern coast of Moss, before attending high school in Oslo (known then as Christiania). After graduating from high school, his ambition towards a military career was dashed when the army rejected him due to poor eyesight. He then enrolled at the University of Christiania.

Sophus Lie&#x27;s first mathematical work, &quot;Repräsentation der Imaginären der Plangeometrie&quot;, was published in 1869 by the Academy of Sciences in Christiania and also by &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot;. That same year he received a scholarship and travelled to Berlin, where he stayed from September to February 1870. There, he met Felix Klein and they became close friends. When he left Berlin, Lie travelled to Paris, where he was joined by Klein two months later. There, they met Camille Jordan and Gaston Darboux. But on 19 July 1870 the Franco-Prussian War began and Klein (who was Prussian) had to leave France very quickly. Lie left for Fontainebleau where he was arrested, suspected of being a German spy, garnering him fame in Norway. He was released from prison after a month, thanks to the intervention of Darboux.

Lie obtained his PhD at the University of Christiania (in present-day Oslo) in 1871 with a thesis entitled &quot;Over en Classe geometriske Transformationer&quot; (On a Class of Geometric Transformations). It would be described by Darboux as &quot;one of the most handsome discoveries of modern Geometry&quot;. The next year, the Norwegian Parliament established an extraordinary professorship for him. That same year, Lie visited Klein, who was then at Erlangen and working on the Erlangen program.

In 1872, Lie spent eight months together with Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow, editing and publishing the mathematical works of their countryman, Niels Henrik Abel.

At the end of 1872, Sophus Lie proposed to Anna Birch, then eighteen years old, and they were married in 1874. The couple had three children: Marie (b. 1877), Dagny (b. 1880) and Herman (b. 1884).

From 1876, he co-edited the journal &quot;Archiv for Mathematik og Naturvidenskab&quot;, together with the physician Jacob Worm-Müller, and the biologist Georg Ossian Sars.

In 1884, Friedrich Engel arrived at Christiania to help him, with the support of Klein and Adolph Mayer (who were both professors at Leipzig by then). Engel would help Lie to write his most important treatise, &quot;Theorie der Transformationsgruppen&quot;, published in Leipzig in three volumes from 1888 to 1893. Decades later, Engel would also be one of the two editors of Lie&#x27;s collected works.

In 1886, Lie became a professor at Leipzig, replacing Klein, who had moved to Göttingen. In November 1889, Lie suffered a mental breakdown and had to be hospitalized until June 1890. Subsequently he returned to his post, but over the years his anaemia progressed to the point where he returned to his homeland. In 1898 he tendered his resignation in May, and left for home in September the same year. He died the following year in 1899 at the age of 56, due to pernicious anemia, a disease caused by impaired absorption of vitamin B12.

He was made Honorary Member of the London Mathematical Society in 1878, Corresponding Member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1892, Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in 1895 and foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America in 1895.

== Legacy ==

Lie&#x27;s principal tool, and one of his greatest achievements, was the discovery that continuous transformation groups (now called, after him, Lie groups) could be better understood by &quot;linearizing&quot; them, and studying the corresponding generating vector fields (the so-called infinitesimal generators). The generators are subject to a linearized version of the group law, now called the commutator bracket, and have the structure of what is today called a Lie algebra.

Hermann Weyl used Lie&#x27;s work on group theory in his papers from 1922 and 1923, and Lie groups today play a role in quantum mechanics. However, the subject of Lie groups as it is studied today is vastly different from what the research by Sophus Lie was about and &quot;among the 19th century masters, Lie&#x27;s work is &quot;in detail&quot; certainly the least known today&quot;.

Sophus Lie was an eager proponent in the establishment of the Abel Prize. Inspired by the Nansen fund named after Fridtjof Nansen, and the lack of a prize for mathematics in the Nobel Prize. He gathered support for the establishment of an award for outstanding work in pure mathematics.

Lie advised many doctoral students who went on to become successful mathematicians. Élie Cartan became widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century. Kazimierz Żorawski&#x27;s work was proved to be of importance to a variety of fields. Hans Frederick Blichfeldt made contributions to various fields of mathematics.

<text>The 1924 [[Winter Olympics]], officially known as the I Olympic Winter Games () and commonly known as Chamonix 1924 (), were a winter multi-sport event which was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France. Originally held in association with the 1924 Summer Olympics, the sports competitions were held at the foot of Mont Blanc in Chamonix, and Haute-Savoie, France between 25 January and 5 February 1924. The Games were organized by the French Olympic Committee, and were originally reckoned as the &quot;International Winter Sports Week&quot;. With the success of the event, it was retroactively designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as &quot;the first Olympic Winter Games&quot;.

The tradition of holding the Winter Olympics in the same year as the Summer Olympics would continue until 1992, after which the current practice of holding a Winter Olympics in the second year after each Summer Olympics began.

Although figure skating had been an Olympic event in both London and Antwerp and ice hockey had been an event in Antwerp, winter sports had always been limited by the season. In 1921, at the IOC convention in Lausanne, there was a call for equality for winter sports. After much discussion, organizing an &quot;international week of winter sport&quot; in 1924 in Chamonix was decided.

While not one of the official 16 events (nor one of the 6 sports) during the &quot;International Winter Sports Week&quot;, the closing ceremony included Pierre de Coubertin presenting gold medals in &quot;Alpinism&quot; (mountaineering) to the members of the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition, represented in Chamonix by Lt Col Edward Strutt, deputy expedition leader.

==Highlights==

=== Day 2 ===
The first gold medal to be awarded at the Olympic Winter Games was won by Charles Jewtraw of the United States in the 500-meter speed skate, making him the first Winter Olympic champion.

=== Day 4 ===
Sonja Henie of Norway, at just eleven years old, took part in the ladies&#x27; figure skating competition. Although she finished last, she became popular with fans and went on to take gold at the following three Winter Olympics.

=== Day 6 ===
Figure skater Gillis Grafström of Sweden became the first athlete to successfully defend his Summer Olympic title at the Winter Olympics (having won a gold medal in 1920).

=== Day 8 ===
The Canadian ice hockey team (Toronto Granites) finished their qualifying round with three wins against Czechoslovakia (30–0), Sweden (22–0), and Switzerland (33–0), scoring a total of 85 goals and conceding none.

=== Day 10 ===
Finding themselves in the same situation as Gillis Grafström, the Canadian ice hockey team is the last to defend its Summer Olympics title at the Winter Olympics successfully. Canada would dominate ice hockey in early Olympic competitions, winning six of the first seven gold medals awarded.

=== Epilogue ===
Taffy Abel (1900–1964) was an Indigenous Ojibwe ice hockey player. He was the first Native American in the Winter Olympic Games (1924 Hockey Silver Medal), 1924 Flag Bearer for the United States at the 1924 Winter Olympics, first Native American in the National Hockey League (1926), Stanley Cup champion (1929) and (1934).

At the closing ceremony, a prize for a sport not part of the Olympic Winter Games was awarded for alpinism by Pierre de Coubertin to Lt Col Edward Strutt, the deputy leader of and on behalf of the British expedition which had attempted to climb Mount Everest in 1922.

For the first time in the history of the modern Olympics, the host country (in this case, France) failed to win any gold medals, finishing with three bronze medals. The same outcome occurred at the next Winter Olympics in St. Moritz where Switzerland won only a single bronze medal, the lowest ever output by a host nation at an Olympics. Later host nations to finish without gold medals included Canada at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Yugoslavia at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, and Canada for a second time at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.

In 1925, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to organize the Olympic Winter Games every four years, independent of the Olympic Games proper, and recognized the International Winter Sports Week as the first Olympic Winter Games in retrospect.

The final individual medal of Chamonix 1924 was presented in 1974. The ski jumping event was unusual because the bronze medalist was not determined for fifty years. Norway&#x27;s Thorleif Haug was awarded third place at the event&#x27;s conclusion, but a clerical error in calculating Haug&#x27;s score was discovered in 1974 by skiing historian Jakob Vaage, who further determined that Anders Haugen of the United States, who had finished fourth, had actually scored 0.095 points more than Haug. This was verified by the IOC, and in Oslo in September 1974, Haug&#x27;s daughter presented the medal to the 86-year-old Haugen.

In 2006, the IOC confirmed that the medals awarded to the 1924 curling and military patrol teams were official. The IOC verified that curling was officially part of the program, after the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; newspaper filed a claim on behalf of the families of the team.

== Events ==
Medals were awarded in 16 events contested in 5 sports (9 disciplines). Many sources do not list curling and the military patrol, or list them as demonstration events. However, no such designation was made in 1924. In February 2006, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ruled that curling and military patrol were full part of the Olympic program, and have included the medals awarded in the official count.

<text>Ngô Đình Diệm ( , or ; ; 3 January 1901 – 2 November 1963) was a South Vietnamese politician who was the final prime minister of the State of Vietnam (1954–1955) and later the first president of South Vietnam (Republic of Vietnam) from 1955 until his capture and assassination during the CIA-backed 1963 coup d&#x27;état.

Diệm was born into a prominent Catholic family with his father, Ngô Đình Khả, being a high-ranking mandarin for Emperor Thành Thái during the French colonial era. Diệm was educated at French-speaking schools and considered following his brother Ngô Đình Thục into the priesthood, but eventually chose to pursue a career in the civil service. He progressed rapidly in the court of Emperor Bảo Đại, becoming governor of Bình Thuận Province in 1929 and interior minister in 1933. However, he resigned from the latter position after three months and publicly denounced the emperor as a tool of France. Diệm came to support Vietnamese nationalism, promoting both anti-communism, in opposition to Hồ Chí Minh, and decolonization, in opposition to Bảo Đại. He established the Cần Lao Party to support his political doctrine of Person Dignity Theory, which was heavily influenced by the teachings of Personalism, mainly from French philosopher Emmanuel Mounier, and Confucianism, which Diệm had greatly admired.

After several years in exile in Japan, the United States, and Europe, Diệm returned home in July 1954 and was appointed prime minister by Bảo Đại, against the French suggestion of Nguyen Ngoc Bich (a French-educated engineer, Francophile anticolonialist, a resistance hero in the First Indochina War, and medical doctor) as an alternative. The 1954 Geneva Conference took place soon after he took office, formally partitioning Vietnam along the 17th parallel. Diệm, with the aid of his younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu, soon consolidated power in South Vietnam. After the fraudulent 1955 State of Vietnam referendum, he proclaimed the creation of the Republic of Vietnam, with himself as president. His government was supported by other anti-communist countries, most notably the United States. Diệm pursued a series of nation-building projects, promoting industrial and rural development. From 1957 onward, as part of the Vietnam War, he faced a communist insurgency backed by North Vietnam, eventually formally organized under the banner of the Viet Cong. He was subject to several assassination and coup attempts, and in 1962 established the Strategic Hamlet Program as the cornerstone of his counterinsurgency effort.

In 1963, Diệm&#x27;s favoritism towards Catholics and persecution of practitioners of Buddhism in Vietnam led to the Buddhist crisis. The event damaged relations with the United States and other previously sympathetic countries, and his organization lost favor with the leadership of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. On 1 November 1963, the country&#x27;s leading generals launched a coup d&#x27;état with assistance from the Central Intelligence Agency. Diệm and his brother, Nhu, initially escaped, but were recaptured the following day and assassinated on the orders of Dương Văn Minh, who succeeded him as president.

Diệm has been a controversial historical figure. Some historians have considered him a tool of the United States, while others portrayed him as an avatar of Vietnamese tradition. At the time of his assassination, he was widely considered to be a corrupt dictator.

==Family and early life==

Ngô Đình Diệm was born in 1901 in Quảng Bình province, in Central Vietnam. His family originated in Phú Cam, a Catholic village adjacent to Huế. His ancestors had been among Vietnam&#x27;s earliest Catholic converts in the 17th century. Diệm was given a saint&#x27;s name at birth, &quot;Gioan Baotixita&quot; (a Vietnamized form of John the Baptist), following the custom of the Catholic Church. The Ngô-Đình family suffered under the anti-Catholic persecutions of Emperors Minh Mạng and Tự Đức. In 1880, while Diệm&#x27;s father, Ngô Đình Khả (1850–1925), was studying in British Malaya, an anti-Catholic riot led by Buddhist monks almost wiped out the Ngô-Đình clan. Over 100 of the Ngô clan were &quot;burned alive in a church including Khả&#x27;s father, brothers, and sisters.&quot;

Ngô Đình Khả was educated in a Catholic school in British Malaya, where he learned English and studied the European-style curriculum. He was a devout Catholic and scrapped plans to become a Roman Catholic priest in the late 1870s. He worked for the commander of the French armed forces as an interpreter and took part in campaigns against anti-colonial rebels in the mountains of Tonkin during 1880. He rose to become a high-ranking mandarin, the first headmaster of the National Academy in Huế (founded in 1896), and a counsellor to Emperor Thành Thái of French Indochina. He was appointed minister of the rites and chamberlain and keeper of the eunuchs. Despite his collaboration with the French colonizers, Khả was &quot;motivated less by Francophilia than by certain reformist ambitions&quot;. Like Phan Châu Trinh, Khả believed that independence from France could be achieved only after changes in Vietnamese politics, society, and culture had occurred. In 1907, after the ouster of emperor Thành Thái, Khả resigned his appointments, withdrew from the imperial court, and became a farmer in the countryside.

Khả decided to abandon his studies for the priesthood and instead married. After his first wife died childless, Khả remarried and, in a period of twenty-three years, had twelve children with his second wife, Phạm Thị Thân, nine of whom survived infancy – six sons and three daughters. These were Ngô Đình Khôi, Ngô Đình Thị Giao, Ngô Đình Thục, Ngô Đình Diệm, Ngô Đình Thị Hiệp, Ngô Đình Thị Hoàng, Ngô Đình Nhu, Ngô Đình Cẩn and Ngô Đình Luyện. As a devout Roman Catholic, Khả took his entire family to daily morning Mass and encouraged his sons to study for the priesthood. Having learned both Latin and classical Chinese, Khả strove to make sure his children were well educated in both Christian scriptures and Confucian classics. During his childhood, Diệm laboured in the family&#x27;s rice fields while studying at a French Catholic primary school (Pellerin School) in Huế, and later entered a private school started by his father, where he studied French, Latin, and classical Chinese. At the age of fifteen he briefly followed his elder brother, Ngô Đình Thục, who would become Vietnam&#x27;s highest-ranking Catholic bishop, into seminary. Diệm swore himself to celibacy to prove his devotion to his faith, but found monastic life too rigorous and decided not to pursue a clerical career. According to Mark Moyar, Diệm&#x27;s personality was too independent to adhere to the disciplines of the Church, while Jarvis recalls Ngô Đình Thục&#x27;s ironic observation that the Church was &quot;too worldly&quot; for Diệm. Diệm also inherited his father&#x27;s antagonism toward the French colonialists who occupied his country.

At the end of his secondary schooling at Lycée Quốc học, the French lycée in Huế, Diem&#x27;s outstanding examination results elicited the offer of a scholarship to study in Paris. He declined and, in 1918, enrolled at the prestigious School of Public Administration and Law in Hanoi, a French school that prepared young Vietnamese to serve in the colonial administration. It was there that he had the only romantic relationship of his life when he fell in love with one of his teacher&#x27;s daughters. After his love interest chose to persist with her religious vocation and entered a convent, he remained celibate for the rest of his life. Diệm&#x27;s family, educational, and religious values greatly influenced his life and career. Historian Edward Miller stated that Diệm &quot;displayed Christian piety in everything from his devotional practices to his habit of inserting references to the Bible into his speeches&quot;; he also enjoyed showing off his knowledge of classical Chinese texts.

== Early career ==
After graduating at the top of his class in 1921, Diệm followed in the footsteps of his eldest brother, Ngô Đình Khôi, joining the civil service in Thừa Thiên as a junior official. Starting from the lowest rank of mandarin, Diệm steadily rose over the next decade. He first served at the royal library in Huế, and within one year was the district chief in both Thừa Thiên and nearby Quảng Trị province, presiding over seventy villages. Diệm was promoted to be a provincial chief (Tuần phủ) in Ninh Thuận at the age of 28, overseeing 300 villages.

During his career as a mandarin, Diệm was known for his industriousness and incorruptibility, and as a Catholic leader and nationalist. Catholic nationalism in Vietnam during the 1920s and 1930s facilitated Diệm&#x27;s ascent in his bureaucratic career.

Diệm&#x27;s rise was also facilitated through his brother Ngô Đình Khôi&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of Nguyễn Hữu Bài, who was the Catholic head of the Council of Ministers at the Huế court. Bài also supported the indigenization of the Vietnamese Church and giving more administrative powers to the monarchy. Bài was highly regarded among the French administration. Diệm&#x27;s religious and family ties impressed Bài and he became Diệm&#x27;s patron. The French were impressed by his work ethic but were irritated by Diệm&#x27;s frequent calls to grant more autonomy to Vietnam. Diệm contemplated resigning but encouragement from the populace convinced him to persist. In 1925, he first encountered communists distributing propaganda while riding horseback through the region near Quảng Trị. Revolted by calls for violent socialist revolution contained in the propaganda leaflets, Diệm involved himself in anti-communist activities for the first time, spreading his own anti-communist pamphlets.

In 1929, he was promoted to the governorship of Bình Thuận Province and was known for his work ethic. In 1930 and 1931, he helped the French suppress the first peasant revolts organized by the communists. According to historian Bernard B. Fall Diệm put the revolts down as he believed they would not lead to the removal of the French but might threaten the leadership of the mandarins. In 1933, with the ascension of Bảo Đại to the throne, Diệm accepted Bảo Đại&#x27;s invitation to be his interior minister following lobbying by Nguyễn Hữu Bài. Soon after his appointment, Diệm headed a commission to advise on potential administration reforms. After calling for the French administration to introduce a Vietnamese legislature and many other political reforms, he resigned after three months in office when his proposals were rejected. Diệm denounced Emperor Bảo Đại as &quot;nothing but an instrument in the hands of the French administration&quot;, and renounced his decorations and titles from Bảo Đại. The French administration then threatened him with arrest and exile.

For the next decade, Diệm lived as a private citizen with his family in Huế, although he was kept under surveillance. He spent his time reading, meditating, attending church, gardening, hunting, and in amateur photography. Diệm also conducted extensive nationalist activities during those 21 years, engaging in meetings and correspondence with various leading Vietnamese revolutionaries, such as his friend, Phan Bội Châu, a Vietnamese anti-colonial activist, whom Diệm respected for his knowledge of Confucianism and argued that Confucianism&#x27;s teachings could be applied to a modern Vietnam. With the start of the World War II in the Pacific, seeing an opportunity for Vietnam to challenge French colonization, he attempted to persuade the Japanese forces to declare independence for Vietnam in 1942 but was ignored. Diệm also tried to establish relationships with Japanese diplomats, army officers, and intelligence operatives who supported Vietnam&#x27;s independence. In 1943, Diệm&#x27;s Japanese friends helped him to contact Prince Cường Để, an anti-colonial activist, who was in exile in Japan.

After contacting Cường Để, Diệm formed a secret political party, the Association for the Restoration of Great Vietnam (Việt Nam Đại Việt Phục Hưng Hội), which was dominated by his Catholic allies in Hue. When its existence was discovered in the summer of 1944, the French declared Diệm to be subversive and ordered his arrest. He flew to Saigon under Japanese military protection, staying there until the end of WWII.

In 1945, after the coup against French colonial rule, the Japanese offered Diệm the post of prime minister in the Empire of Vietnam under Bảo Đại, which they organized on leaving the country. He declined initially, but reconsidered his decision and attempted to reverse the refusal. However, Bảo Đại had already given the post to Trần Trọng Kim. In September 1945, after the Japanese withdrawal, Hồ Chí Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and in the Northern half of Vietnam, his Việt Minh began fighting the French administration. Diệm attempted to travel to Huế to dissuade Bảo Đại from joining Hồ but was arrested by the Việt Minh along the way and exiled to a highland village near the border. He might have died of malaria, dysentery, and influenza had the local tribesmen not nursed him back to health. Six months later, he was taken to meet Hồ, who recognized Diệm&#x27;s virtues and, wanting to extend the support for his new government, asked Diệm to be a minister of the interior. Diệm refused to join the Việt Minh, assailing Hồ for the murder of his brother Ngô Đình Khôi by Việt Minh cadres.During the Indochina War, Diệm and other non-communist nationalists had to face a dilemma: they did not want to restore colonial rule and did not want to support the Việt Minh. Diệm proclaimed his neutrality and attempted to establish a Third Force movement that was both anti-colonialist and anti-communist In 1947, he became the founder and chief of the National Union Bloc (Khối Quốc Gia Liên Hiệp) and then folded it into the Vietnam National Rally (Việt Nam Quốc Gia Liên Hiệp), which united non-communist Vietnamese nationalists. He also established relationships with some leading Vietnamese anti-communists like Nguyễn Tôn Hoàn (1917–2001), a fellow Catholic and political activist. His other allies and advisors were dominated by Catholics, especially his family members and their friends.

Diệm also secretly maintained contact with high-ranking leaders of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to convince them to leave Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s government and join him. Meanwhile, Diệm lobbied French colonial officials for “true independence” for Vietnam, but was disappointed when Bảo Đại agreed to French demands for an “associate state” within the French Union, which allowed France to maintain its diplomatic, economic, and military policies in Vietnam. In the meantime, the French had created the State of Vietnam and Diệm refused Bảo Đại&#x27;s offer to become the Prime Minister. On 16 June 1949, he published a new manifesto in newspapers proclaiming a third force different from the Việt Minh and Bảo Đại, but it raised little interest and provided further evidence to both the French and Việt Minh that Diệm was a dangerous rival.

In 1950, the Việt Minh lost patience and sentenced him to death in absentia, and the French refused to protect him. Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s cadres tried to assassinate him while he was traveling to visit his elder brother Thục, bishop of the Vĩnh Long diocese in the Mekong Delta. Recognizing his political status, Diệm decided to leave Vietnam in 1950.

According to Miller, during his early career, there were at least three ideologies that influenced Diệm&#x27;s social and political views in the 1920s and 1930s. The first of these were Catholic nationalism, which Diệm inherited from his family&#x27;s tradition, especially from his brother Bishop Ngô Đình Thục and Nguyễn Hữu Bài, who advised him to &quot;return the seal&quot; in 1933 to oppose French policies. The second was Diệm&#x27;s understanding of Confucianism, especially through his friendship with Phan Bội Châu who argued that Confucianism&#x27;s teachings could be applied to modern Vietnam. Lastly, instructed by Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm began to examine Personalism, which originated from French Catholicism&#x27;s philosophy and then applied this doctrine as the main ideology of his regime.

==Exile==

Diệm applied for permission to travel to Rome for the Holy Year celebrations at the Vatican. After gaining French permission, he left in August 1950 with his older brother, Bishop Ngô Đình Thục. Before going to Europe, Diệm went to Japan where he met with Prince Cường Để, his former ally, and discussed Cường Để&#x27;s efforts to return to Vietnam and his capacity to play some roles in his homeland. Diệm&#x27;s friend also managed to organize a meeting between him and Wesley Fishel, an American political science professor at the University of California, who was working for the CIA in Japan. Fishel was a proponent of the anti-colonial, anti-communist third force doctrine in Asia and was impressed with Diệm and helped him organize connections in the United States. In 1951, Diệm flew to the United States to seek the support of government officials but he was not successful in winning US support for Vietnamese anti-communists.

In Rome, Diệm obtained an audience with Pope Pius XII at the Vatican before undertaking further lobbying across Europe. He also met with French and Vietnamese officials in Paris and sent a message indicating that he was willing to be the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam to Bảo Đại but Bảo Đại refused to meet with him. Diệm returned to the United States to continue building support among Americans. Nonetheless, to Americans, the fact that Diệm was an anti-communist was not enough to distinguish him from Bảo Đại and other State of Vietnam leaders. Some American officials worried that his devout Catholicism could hinder his ability to mobilize support in a predominantly non-Catholic country. Diệm recognized that concern and broadened his lobbying efforts to include a development focus in addition to anti-communism and religious factors. Diệm was motivated by the knowledge that the US was enthusiastic in applying their technology and knowledge to modernize postcolonial countries. With the help of Fishel, then at Michigan State University (MSU), Diệm was appointed as a consultant to MSU&#x27;s Government Research Bureau. MSU was administering government-sponsored assistance programs for Cold War allies, and Diệm helped Fishel to lay the foundation for a program later implemented in South Vietnam, the Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group.

The Americans&#x27; assessments of Diệm were varied but Diệm did gain favor with some high-ranking officials, such as Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, Roman Catholic cardinal Francis Spellman, Representative Mike Mansfield of Montana, and Representative John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts along with numerous journalists, academics, and the former director of the Office of Strategic Services William J. Donovan. Although he did not succeed in winning official support from the US, his personal interactions with American political leaders promised the prospect of gaining more support in the future. Mansfield remembered after the luncheon with Diệm held on 8 May 1953, he felt that &quot;if anyone could hold South Vietnam, it was somebody like Ngô Đình Diệm&quot;.

During Diệm&#x27;s exile, his brothers Nhu, Cẩn, and Luyện played important roles in helping him build international and internal networks and support in different ways for his return to Vietnam. In the early 1950s, Nhu established the Cần Lao Party, which played a key role in helping Diệm attain and consolidate his power.

==Becoming Prime Minister and consolidation of power==
Until 1953, the State of Vietnam was nominally independent from Paris. Since dissatisfaction with France and Bảo Đại was rising among non-communist nationalists, and support from non-communist nationalists and Diệm&#x27;s allies was rising for his &quot;true independence&quot; point of view, Diệm sensed that it was time for him to come to power in Vietnam.In early 1954, Bảo Đại offered Diệm the position of Prime Minister in the new government in Vietnam. In May 1954, the French surrendered at Điện Biên Phủ and the Geneva Conference began in April 1954. On 16 June 1954, Diệm met with Bảo Đại in France and agreed to be the Prime Minister if Bảo Đại would give him military and civilian control. On 25 June 1954, Diệm returned from exile, arriving at Tân Sơn Nhứt airport in Saigon. On 7 July 1954, Diệm established his new government with a cabinet of 18 people.

In the first period of his premiership, Diệm did not have much power in the government; he lacked control of the military and police forces, and the civil system&#x27;s key positions were still held by French officials. He also could not control the Bank of Indochina. Besides, Diệm had to face massive obstacles: refugee issues; the French colonists wanting to remove Diệm to protect France&#x27;s interest in South Vietnam; General Nguyễn Văn Hinh, a Francophile, the leader of National Army was ready to oust Diệm; the leaders of the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài sectarian armies wanted positions in Diệm&#x27;s cabinet and complete administrative control over the areas in which they had large numbers of followers; and the major threat of Bình Xuyên, an organized crime syndicate that controlled the National Police led by Lê Văn Viễn, whose power was focused in Saigon. In summer 1954, the three organizations controlled approximately one-third of the territory and population of South Vietnam. Besides his own political skills, Diệm had to trust in his relatives and the backing of his American supporters to overcome the obstacles and neutralize his opponents.

=== Partition ===

On 21 July 1954, the Geneva Accords temporarily partitioned Vietnam at the 17th parallel, pending elections in July 1956 to reunify the country. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam controlled the north, while the French-backed State of Vietnam controlled the south with Diệm as the Prime Minister. Diệm criticized the French for abandoning North Vietnam to the Communists at Geneva, claimed that the terms did not represent the will of the Vietnamese people, and refused French suggestions to include more pro-French officials in the government.

The Geneva Accords allowed for freedom of movement between the two zones until October 1954; this put a large strain on the south. Diệm had only expected 10,000 refugees, but by August, there were more than 200,000 waiting for evacuation from Hanoi and Hải Phòng. Nevertheless, the migration helped to strengthen Diệm&#x27;s political base of support as the refugees were strongly anti-communist. To deal with the refugee situation, Diem&#x27;s government arranged for their relocation into fertile and under-populated provinces in the western Mekong Delta. The Diệm regime also provided them with food and shelter, farm tools, and housing materials as well as digging irrigation canals, building dykes, and dredging swamp-lands to help stabilise their lives.

=== Establishing control ===

In August 1954, Diệm also had to face the &quot;Hinh crisis&quot; when Hinh launched a series of public attacks on Diem, proclaiming that South Vietnam needed a “strong and popular” leader, as well as threatening to coup. However, at the end of 1954, Diệm successfully forced Hinh to resign from his post. Hinh had to flee to Paris and hand over his command of the national army to General Nguyễn Văn Vy. But the National Army officers favoured Diệm&#x27;s leadership over General Vy, which forced him to flee to Paris. Despite the failure of Hinh&#x27;s alleged coup, the French continued to encourage Diệm&#x27;s enemies in an attempt to destabilize him.

On 31 December 1954, Diệm established the National Bank of Vietnam and replaced the Indochinese banknotes with new Vietnamese banknotes. In early 1955, although American advisors encouraged Diệm to negotiate with the leaders of the political-religious forces who threatened to overthrow his position and to forge an anti-communist bloc, he was determined to attack his enemies to consolidate his power. In April 1955, Diệm&#x27;s army forces took most of Bình Xuyên&#x27;s posts in Saigon after a victory in the Battle of Saigon. Within a few months, Diệm&#x27;s troops wiped out the Bình Xuyên&#x27;s remnants, leaving only a few small bands, who then joined forces with the communists.

The defeat of Bình Xuyên increased the authority and prestige of Diệm&#x27;s government and marked the end of French efforts to remove Diệm. Most of the Cao Đài leaders chose to rally to Diệm&#x27;s government. Diệm then dismantled the private armies of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects. By the end of 1955, Diệm had almost taken control of South Vietnam, and his government was stronger than ever before. In April 1956, along with the capture of Ba Cụt, the leader of the last Hòa Hảo rebels, Diệm almost subdued all of his non-communist enemies, and could focus on his Vietnamese communist opponents. According to Miller, Diệm&#x27;s capacity in subduing his enemies and consolidating his power strengthened U.S. support of his government, although the U.S. government had planned to withdraw its backing from Diệm during his early difficult years of leadership.

==Presidency (1955–1963)==
===Establishment of the Republic of Vietnam===
In South Vietnam, a referendum was scheduled for 23 October 1955 to determine the future direction of the south, in which the people would choose Diệm or Bảo Đại as the leader of South Vietnam. Diem, with the support of his brother Ngô Đình Nhu and the Cần Lao Party, used an avid propaganda campaign to destroy Bảo Đại&#x27;s reputation and garner support for Diem. Supporters of Bảo Đại were not allowed to campaign, and were physically attacked by Nhu&#x27;s workers. Official results showed 98.2 per cent of voters favoured Diệm, an implausibly high result that was condemned as fraudulent. The total number of votes far exceeded the number of registered voters by over 380,000, further evidence that the referendum was heavily rigged. For example, only 450,000 voters were registered in Saigon, but 605,025 were said to have voted for Diệm.
On 26 October 1955, Diệm proclaimed the formation of the Republic of Vietnam, with himself as its first President until 26 October 1956. The first Constitution provided articles to establish the republic and organize the election of its president. The 1954 Geneva Accords prescribed elections to reunify the country in 1956. Diệm refused to hold these elections, claiming that a free election was not possible in the North and that since the previous State of Vietnam had not signed the accords, they were not bound by it – despite having been part of the French Union, which itself was bound by the Accords. According to historian Keith Taylor, Diệm&#x27;s rejection of the Geneva Accords was a way of objecting to the French colonization of Vietnam, while at the same time expressing his opinion of Bảo Đại, and the establishment of the First Republic of Vietnam served to assert Vietnamese independence from France. At the same time, the first Constitution of the Republic of Vietnam was promulgated. According to the Constitution, the President was granted an inordinate amount of power, and his governing style became increasingly authoritarian over time.

Diệm&#x27;s rule was authoritarian and nepotistic. His most trusted official was his brother Nhu, leader of the primary pro-Diệm party, the Cần Lao Party. Nhu was an opium addict and admirer of Adolf Hitler. He modeled the Cần Lao secret police&#x27;s marching style and torture styles on Nazi methodology. Cẩn, another brother, was put in charge of the former Imperial City of Huế. Although neither Cẩn nor Nhu held any official role in the government, they ruled their regions of South Vietnam absolutely, commanding private armies and secret police forces. Diệm&#x27;s youngest brother Luyện was appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom. His elder brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was Archbishop of Huế. Despite this, Thuc lived in the Presidential Palace, along with Nhu, Nhu&#x27;s wife, and Diệm. Diệm was nationalistic, devoutly Catholic, anti-Communist, and preferred the philosophies of personalism and Confucianism.&lt;
Diệm&#x27;s rule was also pervaded by family corruption. Cẩn was widely believed to be involved in several illegal operations, namely the illegal smuggling of rice to North Vietnam on the black market, the opium trade via Laos, in monopolizing the cinnamon trade, and amassing a fortune in foreign banks. With Nhu, Cẩn competed for U.S. contracts and rice trade. Thuc, the most powerful religious leader in the country, was allowed to solicit &quot;voluntary contributions to the Church&quot; from Saigon businessmen, which was likened to &quot;tax notices.&quot; Thuc also used his position to acquire farms, businesses, urban real estate, rental property, and rubber plantations in the name of the Catholic Church. He also used Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) personnel to work on his timber and construction projects. The Nhus amassed a fortune by running numbers and lottery rackets, manipulating currency and extorting money from Saigon businesses, while Luyen became a multimillionaire by speculating in Piastres and Pounds on the currency exchange using inside government information.

However, Miller wrote that Diệm also clamped down on corruption. South Vietnam was divided into colonial-era provinces, of which governors enjoyed sweeping powers and firmly controlled local administrations, creating a problem of corruption and cronyism. The governors were seen as petty tyrants, and Diệm launched corruption probes while also replacing many of the governors. However, starting in 1954, the political turmoil prevented him from taking further measures. The MSUG, an American advisory body created to aid the Diệm&#x27;s regime, recommended that Diệm centralize power by abolishing local administrations and reforming the existing ones into much larger &quot;areas&quot;, with much less power and no financial autonomy. Diệm objected to abolishing the position of province chiefs, arguing that only local governments could address &quot;the needs of local people&quot; as he believed that requiring fiscal self-sufficiency from the local governments was key to creating the &quot;ethos of mutual responsibility&quot; – a key concept in Diệm&#x27;s communitarian interpretation of democracy.

The Cần Lao Party played a key role in Diệm&#x27;s regime, often acting as much more than a tool of political organization. Initially, the party acted secretly based on a network of cells, and each member only knew the identities of a few other members. When necessary, the Party could assume the role of the government. After 1954, the existence of the party was recognized, but its activities were hidden from public view. In the early 1950s, Diệm and Nhu used the party to mobilize support for Diệm&#x27;s political movements. According to the Republic of Vietnam decree 116/BNV/CT, the Cần Lao Party was established on 2 September 1954. Personalism, as part of Person Dignity Theory, officially became the basic doctrine of Diệm&#x27;s regime, reflected in the Constitution&#x27;s preface, which declared that &quot;Building Politics, Economy, Society, Culture for the people based on respecting Personalism&quot;.

=== Elections ===
According to Miller, democracy, to Diệm, was rooted in his dual identity as Confucian and Catholic, and was associated with communitarianism and the doctrine of Personalism. He defined democracy as &quot;a social ethos based on certain sense of moral duty&quot;, not in the U.S. sense of &quot;political right&quot; or political pluralism and in the context of an Asian country like Vietnam, Confucian and Catholic values were relevant to deal with contemporary problems in politics, governance, and social change. In this sense, Diệm was not a reactionary mandarin lacking an interest in democracy as he has been portrayed by some scholars. His way of thinking about democracy became a key factor of his approach to political and administrative reform. Diệm argued that post-colonial Vietnam must be a democratic country, but noted that Vietnamese democracy should develop out of its precolonial models, rather than European and American concepts, arguing that Vietnamese &quot;institutions, customs and the principles underlying them are democratic facts.&quot; Researching the Nguyễn dynasty, Diệm asserted that the moral norm of Nguyễn-era Vietnam was that it was founded &quot;on the people&quot;, following the Confucian concept of Mandate of Heaven; people could and often did withdraw their support from unpopular monarchs, causing their downfall. Diệm considered it an &quot;indigenous Vietnamese democratic tradition&quot; and wished to make it the basis of democracy that would emerge in Vietnam.

Diệm&#x27;s ideology of personalism was largely influenced by the Confucian notion that self-improvement meant cooperation with one&#x27;s local community and society at large; he thought that there is a tension between individual&#x27;s personal ambitions and community&#x27;s ethos of mutual responsibility. Inspired by the writings of Catholic philosopher Emmanuel Mounier, Diệm considered his ideology of personalism a &quot;third way&quot; of communitarianism, presenting an alternative to both individualism and collectivism, insisting that democracy couldn&#x27;t be realised &quot;by drafting and promulgating documents and regulations&quot;, but that civil liberties granted by democratic regime to its citizens should serve &quot;collective social improvement&quot;, serving each person&#x27;s community rather than the individual itself.

In 1955, Diệm wrote that &quot;democracy is primarily a state of mind, a way of living that respects the human person, both with regard to ourselves and with regard to others&quot; and that &quot;more than any other form of government, democracy demands that we all display wisdom and virtue in our dealings with each other.&quot; In 1956, Diem added that democracy had to foster a feeling of community and mutual responsibility, arguing that respect for democracy lays in &quot;decency in social relations&quot;, thus defining Vietnamese democracy as inherently communitarian and not individualist.

In summer and fall of 1955, Diệm&#x27;s administration had to decide the fate of the former emperor Bảo Đại. Bảo Đại was initially supposed to remain the head of state until the National Assembly elections, but Diệm&#x27;s cabinet decided to decide the monarch&#x27;s fate through a referendum. Miller highlights that despite the popular belief that the referendum was put forward by Edward Lansdale, it was Diệm who decided to organise the referendum as a way to burnish his democratic credentials and attempt to realise his democratic ideas. While the monarch was highly unpopular given his collaboration with the French colonial regime, the new government committed to further diminishing Đại&#x27;s reputation with aggressive smear campaign and large pro-rallies. Additionally, the referendum itself was considered non-secret, given that the voters were given ballots with the photos of Diệm and Bảo Đại on it and were supposed to tear it in half and deposit the slice with their preferred candidate into the box – this made one&#x27;s choice visible to everyone. Miller notes that the referendum reveals the eccentric nature of Diệm&#x27;s understanding of democracy – in the sense of political pluralism, the vote appeared inherently authoritarian; but to Diệm his margin appeared legitimate, as he described democracy as &quot;state of mind&quot; in which the people elect the morally superior leader. Thus Diệm was &quot;adamant that the outcome was entirely consistent with his view of democracy as the citizenry&#x27;s embrace of a common moral ethos&quot;.

On 4 March 1956, the elections for the first National Assembly were held. These elections were considerably more free and fair than the referendum, and some governmental candidates would highly contest with independents and oppositionist candidates for their seats, according to Miller. On this occasion, non-government candidates were allowed to campaign and the election had an atmosphere of legitimate pluralism, but the government retained the right to ban candidates deemed to be linked to the communists or other &#x27;rebel&#x27; groups, and campaign material was screened. However, Miller notes that in some districts the opposition candidates withdrew due to police intimidation and military presence. Surprisingly, instead of letting the draft constitution be created by a handpicked commission, Diệm dissolved it and had the constitution be made by the National Assembly deputies instead. The government hailed the process as democratic and transparent, given how the Assembly meetings were open and media presence was allowed; the National Revolutionary Movement dominated the council, but a handful of opposition figures had won seats as well.

However, Diệm&#x27;s regime of &quot;democratic one man rule&quot; faced increasing difficulties. After coming under pressure from within Vietnam and from the United States, Diệm agreed to hold legislative elections in August 1959 for South Vietnam. However, in reality, newspapers were not allowed to publish names of independent candidates or their policies, and political meetings exceeding five people were prohibited. Candidates who ran against government-supported opponents faced harassment and intimidation. In rural areas, candidates who ran were threatened using charges of conspiracy with the Việt Cộng, which carried the death penalty. Phan Quang Đán, the government&#x27;s most prominent critic, was allowed to run. Despite the deployment of 8,000 ARVN plainclothes troops into his district to vote, Đán still won by a ratio of six to one. The busing of soldiers to vote for regime approved candidates occurred across the country. When the new assembly convened, Đán was arrested.
In May 1961, U.S. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson visited Saigon and enthusiastically declared Diệm the &quot;Winston Churchill of Asia&quot;. When asked why he had made the comment, Johnson replied, &quot;Diệm&#x27;s the only boy we got out there.&quot; Johnson assured Diệm of more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists.

===Socio-economic policies===
During his presidency, Diệm imposed programs to reform Saigon society in accordance with Catholic and Confucian values. Brothels and opium dens were closed, divorce and abortion were made illegal, and adultery laws were strengthened. Additionally, Diệm&#x27;s government established many schools and universities, such as the National Technical Center at Phú Thọ in 1957, the University of Saigon (1956), the University of Hue (1957), and the University of Dalat (1957).

===Rural development===
Diệm hoped to develop a national, revolutionary spirit within the citizens of South Vietnam as well as a vibrant communal democracy and an independent, non-communist Vietnam. He saw the peasantry as the key to this nation-building as he believed the peasantry was more likely to put the country before their own self interest in a spirit of volunteerism. A Special Commissariat for Civic Action was established to extend the reach of the Saigon government into rural areas and to help create &#x27;model villages&#x27; to show rural peasants that the South Vietnamese government was viable as well as allowing citizen volunteers, and experts, to help these communities develop and tie them to the nation. The Special Commissariat for Civic Action was considered a practical tool of Diệm&#x27;s government to serve &quot;the power vacuum&quot;, and be a force of influence for Diệm&#x27;s government, in the rural countryside following the departure of Việt Minh cadres after the Geneva Accords (1954).

Geoffrey C. Stewart&#x27;s study provides a clearer picture of Diệm&#x27;s domestic policies and a further understanding of his government&#x27;s efforts in reaching and connecting with local communities in South Vietnam that shows &quot;an indigenous initiative&quot; of the government in building an independent and viable nation.

Land Reform In South Vietnam, especially in Mekong Delta, landholdings in rural areas were concentrated in small number of rich landlord families. Thus, it was urgent to implement land reform in South Vietnam. Diệm had two attempts to control the excesses of the land tenancy system by promulgating the Ordinance 2 on 28 January 1955 to reduce land rent between 15% and 25% of the average harvest and the Ordinance 7 on 5 February 1955 to protect the rights of tenants on new and abandoned land and enhancing cultivation. In October 1956, with the urge from Wolf Ladejinsky, Diệm&#x27;s personal adviser on agrarian reform, Diệm promulgated a more serious ordinance on the land reform, in which he proclaimed a &quot;land to the tiller&quot; (not to be confused with other Land reform in South Vietnam like Nguyễn Văn Thiệu&#x27;s later &#x27;Land to the Tiller&quot; program) program to put a relatively high 100 hectares limit on rice land and 15 hectares for ancestral worship.

However, this measure had no real effect because many landlords evaded the redistribution by transferring the property to the name of family members. Besides, during the 1946–54 war against the French Union forces, the Việt Minh had gained control of parts of southern Vietnam, initiated land reform, confiscated landlords&#x27; land and distributed it to the peasants. Additionally, the ceiling limit was more than 30 times that allowed in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and the 370,000 acres (1,500 km2) of the Catholic Church&#x27;s landownings in Vietnam were exempted. The political, social, and economic influences of the land reform was minimal. From 1957 to 1963, only 50 percent of expropriated land was redistributed, and only 100,000 out of approximately one million tenant farmers in South Vietnam benefited from the reform.

Resettlement According to Miller, Diệm, who described tenant farmers as a &quot;real proletariat&quot; and pursued the goal of &quot;middle peasantization&quot;, was not a beholden to large landowners, instead of vigorously implementing Land Reform, Diệm had his own vision in Vietnamese rural development based on resettlement, which focused on redistribution of people (rather than land), could reduce overpopulation and lead to many benefits in socio-economic transformation as well as military affairs and security, especially anti-communist infiltration. Moreover, Diệm was ambitious to envision Resettlement as a tactic to practice the government&#x27;s ideological goals. The differences between the US and Diệm over nation building in countryside shaped the clashes in their alliance.

The Cái Sắn resettlement project: In late 1955, with the help of US material support and expertise, Diệm&#x27;s government implemented the project Cái Sắn in An Giang province, which aimed to resettle one hundred thousand northern refugees.

Land Development program (&quot;Khu dinh điền&quot;): In early 1957, Diệm started a new program called the &quot;Land Development&quot; to relocate poor inhabitants, demobilized soldiers, and minority ethnic groups in central and southern Vietnam into abandoned or unused land in Mekong Delta and Central Highlands, and cultivating technological and scientific achievements to transform South Vietnam and ensure security and prevent communist infiltration. Diệm believed that the program would help improve civilians&#x27; lives, teach them the values of being self-reliant and hard working. At the end of 1963, the program had built more than two hundred settlements for a quarter of a million people. Nevertheless, the lacks of conditions in these areas along with the corruption and mercilessness of local officials failed the program.

Agroville program (&quot;khu trù mật&quot;): During late 1959 and early 1960, motivated by the idea of population reunification, Diệm introduced the Agroville Program, which he intended to physically relocate residents who lived in remote and isolated regions in Mekong delta into new settlements in &quot;dense and prosperous areas&quot;proposing to offer them urban modernity and amenities without leaving their farms, and to keep them far away from the communists. Nonetheless, by late 1960, Diệm had to admit that the program&#x27;s objective failed since the residents were not happy with the program and the communists infiltrated it, and he had to discard it.

According to Miller, the disagreement between the US and Diệm over agrarian reform made their alliance &quot;move steadily from bad to worse&quot;. Miller argues that Diệm expressed &quot;genuine desire to end the exploitation and misery that afflicted millions of South Vietnamese rural residents&quot;, and wished to support poor peasantry by gradual modernisation and moderate redistribution of land. Diệm&#x27;s ideal was rendering the Vietnamese countryside dominated by freeholding farmers with roughly equal position of wealth. Diệm wanted to acquire and distribute the land of rich landowners, but also wished to protect the property of middle-class ones. One of the main concerns of Diệm was overpopulation, aggravated by the mass migration of refugees from the North, something that Diệm wished to alleviate by resettlement. Diệm considered resettlement an important part of his economic nationalism, arguing that utilising Vietnamese land would increase the production of grains and rubber and allow South Vietnam to enter international trade. Ideologically, Diệm considered this policy a key to his &quot;Personalist revolution&quot; – the resettled villages would be &quot;neither communist-style collectives nor incubators of rugged individualism&quot;, but they would rather conform to his ideal of communitarianism. Rendering landless peasants freeholders was seen as a step towards reforming the Vietnamese society as a whole.

In late 1955, a Cai San Project was launched that aimed to settle northern refugees in rural areas previously occupied by Hòa Hảo partisans. This project created an intense social conflict between the settlers and Cai San natives, and Diệm offered a concession to the local landowners by decreeing that refugees must sign rental contracts with them. This sparked refugee demonstrations that only started to fade away when Diệm ordered that refugees have the right to buy out the land they worked at. While initially considered a failure, especially due to the fact that the resettlement sparked anti-government sentiment and created social conflicts, Miller notes that Cai San became fairly prosperous by 1960, and the settlement did gradually evolve into a pro-government stronghold, thus succeeding in its aim at counter-insurgency. Many of the counter-insurgency programs progressed too quickly however, and ended up destabilising the regime.

===Counter-insurgency===

During his presidency, Diệm strongly focused on his central concern: internal security to protect his regime as well as maintain order and social change: staunch anti-subversion and anti-rebellion policies. After the Bình Xuyên was defeated and the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài were subdued, Diệm concentrated on his most serious threat: the communists. Diệm&#x27;s main measures for internal security were threats, punishment and intimidation. His regime countered North Vietnamese and communist subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in &quot;political re-education centers&quot;. The North Vietnamese government claimed that over 65,000 individuals were imprisoned and 2,148 killed in the process by November 1957. According to historian Gabriel Kolko, from 1955 to by the end of 1958, 40,000 political prisoners had been jailed and many were executed.

By the end of 1959, Diệm was able to entirely control each family and the communists had to suffer their &quot;darkest period&quot; in their history. Membership declined by two thirds and they had almost no power in the countryside of South Vietnam. Diệm&#x27;s repression extended beyond communists to anti-communist dissidents and anti-corruption whistleblowers. In 1956, after the &quot;Anti-Communist Denunciation Campaign&quot;, Diệm issued Ordinance No. 6, which placed anyone who was considered a threat to the state and public order in jail or house arrest.

Nevertheless, Diệm&#x27;s hard policies led to fear and resentment in many quarters in South Vietnam and negatively affected his relations with the US in terms of counter-insurgent methods. On 22 February 1957, when Diệm delivered a speech at an agricultural fair in Buôn Ma Thuột, a communist named Hà Minh Tri attempted to assassinate the president. He approached Diệm and fired a pistol from close range, but missed, hitting the Secretary for Agrarian Reform&#x27;s left arm. The weapon then jammed and security overpowered Tri before he was able to fire another shot. Diệm was unmoved by the incident. The assassination attempt was the desperate response of the communists to Diệm&#x27;s relentless anti-communist policies.

As opposition to Diệm&#x27;s rule in South Vietnam grew, a low-level insurgency began to take shape there in 1957. Finally, in January 1959, under pressure from southern communist cadres who were being successfully targeted by Diệm&#x27;s secret police, Hanoi&#x27;s Central Committee issued a secret resolution authorizing the use of armed insurgency in the South with supplies and troops from the North. On 20 December 1960, under instructions from Hanoi, southern communists established the Vietcong (VC) in order to overthrow the government of the south. On 11 November 1960, a failed coup attempt against Diệm was led by Lieutenant Colonel Vương Văn Đông and Colonel Nguyễn Chánh Thi of the ARVN Airborne Division. There was a further attempt to assassinate Diệm and his family in February 1962 when two air force officersacting in unisonbombed the Presidential Palace.
In 1962, the cornerstone of Diệm&#x27;s counterinsurgency effort – the Strategic Hamlet Program (&quot;Vietnamese:&quot; &quot;Ấp Chiến lược&quot;), &quot;the last and most ambitious of Diem&#x27;s government&#x27;s nation building schemes&quot;, was implemented, calling for the consolidation of 14,000 villages of South Vietnam into 11,000 secure hamlets, each with its own houses, schools, wells, and watchtowers supported by South Vietnamese government. The hamlets were intended to isolate the VC from the villages, their source for recruiting soldiers, supplies, and information, and to transform the countryside. In the end, because of many shortcomings, the Strategic Hamlet Program was not as successful as had been expected and was cancelled after the assassination of Diệm. However, according to Miller, the program created a remarkable turnabout in Diệm&#x27;s regime in their war against communism. Frederick Nolting reported that Diệm named reestablishing control and security as his number one priority regarding the countryside. While appearing receptive to building an &quot;infrastructure of democracy&quot; in the rural areas, Diệm emphasised that it would have to wait until the conclusion of the war.

===Religious policies and the Buddhist crisis===

By most estimates, Buddhism was followed by 70–90% of the population, though some estimates place it lower, and Buddhism was followed alongside other traditions such as Vietnamese folk religion and Taoism.

Diem was widely regarded by historians as having pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists. Specifically, the government was regarded as being biased towards Catholics in public service and military promotions, as well as the allocation of land, business favors, and tax concessions. Diệm allegedly once told a high-ranking officer, forgetting that he was a Buddhist, &quot;Put your Catholic officers in sensitive places. They can be trusted.&quot; Many officers in the ARVN converted to Catholicism in the belief that their military prospects depended on it. The distribution of weapons to village self-defense militias intended to repel VC guerrillas saw weapons only given to Catholics. Some Buddhist villages converted en masse to Catholicism in order to receive aid or to avoid being forcibly resettled by Diệm&#x27;s regime, with Buddhists in the army being denied promotion if they refused to convert to Catholicism. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies, and in some areas forced conversions, looting, shelling, and demolition of pagodas occurred. Słowiak argues that Diệm&#x27;s favoritism towards Catholics was not a sign of corruption and nepotism, but that it was necessary for Diệm to favor people loyal towards him, given the precarious internal situation of Vietnam.

The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and the &quot;private&quot; status imposed on Buddhism by the French required official permission to conduct public Buddhist activities and was never repealed by Diệm. Catholics were also &quot;de facto&quot; exempt from the &quot;corvée&quot; labor that the government obliged all citizens to perform; US aid was disproportionately distributed to Catholic-majority villages. The land owned by the Catholic Church was exempt from land reform. Under Diệm, the Catholic Church enjoyed special exemptions in property acquisition, and in 1959, Diệm dedicated his country to the Virgin Mary. The white and gold Vatican flag was regularly flown at all major public events in South Vietnam. The newly constructed Hue and Dalat universities were placed under Catholic authority to foster a Catholic-skewed academic environment. Nonetheless, Diệm had contributed to Buddhist communities in South Vietnam by giving them permission to carry out activities that were banned by the French and supported money for Buddhist schools, ceremonies, and building more pagodas. Among the eighteen members of Diệm&#x27;s cabinet, there were five Catholics, five Confucians, and eight Buddhists, including a vice-president and a foreign minister. Only three of the top nineteen military officials were Catholics.

The regime&#x27;s relations with the United States worsened during 1963, as discontent among South Vietnam&#x27;s Buddhist majority was simultaneously heightened. In May, in the heavily Buddhist central city of Huếthe seat of Diệm&#x27;s elder brother as the local Catholic archbishopthe Buddhist majority was prohibited from displaying Buddhist flags during Vesak celebrations commemorating the birth of Gautama Buddha when the government cited a regulation prohibiting the display of non-government flags. A few days earlier, however, white and yellow Catholic papal flags flew at the 25th anniversary commemoration of Ngô Đình Thục&#x27;s elevation to the rank of bishop. According to Miller, Diệm then proclaimed the flag embargo because he was annoyed with the commemoration for Thục. However, the ban on religious flags led to a protest led by Thích Trí Quang against the government, which was suppressed by Diệm&#x27;s forces, and unarmed civilians were killed in the clash. Diệm and his supporters blamed the Việt Cộng for the deaths and claimed the protesters were responsible for the violence. Although the provincial chief expressed sorrow for the killings and offered to compensate the victims&#x27; families, they resolutely denied that government forces were responsible for the killings and blamed the Viet Cong. According to Diệm, it was the communists who threw a grenade into the crowd.

The Buddhists pushed for a five-point agreement: freedom to fly religious flags, an end to arbitrary arrests, compensation for the Huế victims, punishment for the officials responsible, and religious equality. Diệm then banned demonstrations and ordered his forces to arrest those who engaged in civil disobedience. On 3 June 1963, protesters attempted to march towards the Từ Đàm pagoda. Six waves of ARVN tear gas and attack dogs failed to disperse the crowds. Finally, brownish-red liquid chemicals were doused on praying protesters, resulting in 67 being hospitalized for chemical injuries. A curfew was subsequently enacted.

The turning point came in June when a Buddhist monk, Thích Quảng Đức, set himself on fire in the middle of a busy Saigon intersection in protest of Diệm&#x27;s policies; photos of this event were disseminated around the world, and for many people these pictures came to represent the failure of Diệm&#x27;s government. A number of other monks publicly self-immolated, and the US grew increasingly frustrated with the unpopular leader&#x27;s public image in both Vietnam and the United States. Diệm used his conventional anti-communist argument, identifying the dissenters as communists. As demonstrations against his government continued throughout the summer, the special forces loyal to Diệm&#x27;s brother, Nhu, conducted an August raid of the Xá Lợi pagoda in Saigon. Pagodas were vandalized, monks beaten, and the cremated remains of Quảng Đức, which included his heart, a religious relic, were confiscated. Simultaneous raids were carried out across the country, with the Từ Đàm pagoda in Huế looted, the statue of Gautama Buddha demolished, and the body of a deceased monk confiscated. When the populace came to the defense of the monks, the resulting clashes saw 30 civilians killed and 200 wounded. In all 1,400 monks were arrested, and some thirty were injured across the country. The United States indicated its disapproval of Diệm&#x27;s administration when ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. visited the pagoda. No further mass Buddhist protests occurred during the remainder of Diệm&#x27;s rule.

Madame Nhu Trần Lệ Xuân, Nhu&#x27;s wife, inflamed the situation by mockingly applauding the suicides, stating, &quot;If the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I will be glad to supply the gasoline.&quot; The pagoda raids stoked widespread public disquiet in Saigon. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which led to arrests, imprisonments, and the closure of the university; this was repeated at Huế University. When high school students demonstrated, Diệm arrested them as well; over 1,000 students from Saigon&#x27;s leading high school, most of them children of Saigon civil servants, were sent to re-education camps, including, reportedly, children as young as five, on charges of anti-government graffiti. Diệm&#x27;s foreign minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving his head like a Buddhist monk in protest. When he attempted to leave the country on a religious pilgrimage to India, he was detained and kept under house arrest.

At the same time that the Buddhist crisis was taking place, a French diplomatic initiative to end the war had been launched. The initiative was known to historians as the &quot;Maneli affair&quot;, after Mieczysław Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the International Control Commission who served as an intermediary between the two Vietnams. In 1963, North Vietnam was suffering its worst drought in a generation. Maneli conveyed messages between Hanoi and Saigon negotiating a declaration of a ceasefire in exchange for South Vietnamese rice being traded for North Vietnamese coal. On 2 September 1963, Maneli met with Nhu at his office in the Gia Long Palace, a meeting that Nhu leaked to the American columnist Joseph Alsop, who revealed it to the world in his &quot;A Matter of Fact&quot; column in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Nhu&#x27;s purpose in leaking the meeting was to blackmail the United States with the message that if Kennedy continued to criticize Diệm&#x27;s handling of the Buddhist crisis, Diem would reach an understanding with the Communists. The Kennedy administration reacted with fury at what Alsop had revealed. In a message to Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Roger Hilsman urged that a coup against Diệm be encouraged to take place promptly, saying that the mere possibility that Diệm might make a deal with the Communists meant that he had to go.

There have been many interpretations of the Buddhist crisis and the immolation of Thích Quảng Đức in 1963. Relating the events to the larger context of Vietnamese Buddhism in the 20th century and looking at the interactions between Diệm and Buddhist groups, the Buddhist protests during Diệm&#x27;s regime were not only the struggles against discrimination in religious practices and religious freedom, but also the resistance of Vietnamese Buddhism to Diệm&#x27;s nation-building policies centered by a personalist revolution that Buddhists considered a threat to the revival of Vietnamese Buddhist power. Until the end of his life, Diệm, along with his brother Nhu still believed that their nation-building was successful and they could resolve the Buddhist crisis in their own way, like what they had done with the Hinh crisis in 1954 and the struggle with the Bình Xuyên in 1955.

Jerema Słowiak of Jagiellonian University notes that the American media coverage skewed the true background of the conflict, spreading the &quot;narrative of evil dictator Diệm oppressing good, peaceful Buddhists&quot;. Because of this, Diệm was considered a brutal and corrupt dictator in the United States at the time of his assassination. However, Diệm enjoyed relatively good relations with the Buddhists until 1963, and sponsored numerous Buddhist temples, especially Xá Lợi Pagoda in 1956. Vietnamese Buddhists had a nationalist vision for Vietnam of their own, and were political enemies of Diệm, engaged in &quot;a clash of two competing visions of Vietnam&quot;. The Buddhist challenge to Diệm was politically motivated and constituted struggle for power rather than a religious conflict – the Buddhists protested mainly against the Ngo family and rejected Diệm&#x27;s concessions, as their explicit goal was removal of Diệm. Thích Trí Quang, the leader of the Buddhist movement, insisted that the agitation must not stop until the South Vietnamese government is overthrown, and stated his intention to &quot;call for suicide volunteers&quot; if necessary. Edward Miller also argues that the primary cause of the protests was the opposition to Diệm and his agenda rather than the discriminatory policies, as the Buddhist movements of Vietnam had their own political goals that starkly contrasted with Diệm&#x27;s. Diệm reacted to the Buddhist resistance the same way he reacted to the Sect Crisis of 1955, and Xá Lợi Pagoda raids successfully broke the protesters&#x27; movement. The military supported Diệm, and army leaders helped plan the raids and advocated for a forceful response to the protests, and only American disapproval drove military cliques to reconsider their support for Diệm.

===Foreign policy===

The foreign policy of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), according to Fishel, &quot;to a very considerable extent&quot;, was the policy of Ngô Đình Diệm himself during this period. He was the decisive factor in formulating foreign policies of the RVN, besides the roles of his adviser – Ngô Đình Nhu and his foreign ministers: Trần Văn Độ (1954–1955), Vũ Văn Mẫu (1955–1963) and Phạm Đăng Lâm (1963) who played subordinate roles in his regime. Nevertheless, since Diệm had to pay much attention to domestic issues in the context of the Vietnam War, foreign policy did not receive appropriate attention from him. Diệm paid more attention to countries that affected Vietnam directly and he seemed to personalize and emotionalize relations with other nations. The issues Diệm paid more attention in foreign affairs were: the Geneva Accords, the withdrawal of the French, international recognition, the cultivation of the legitimacy of the RVN and the relations with the United States, Laos (good official relations) and Cambodia (complicated relations, especially due to border disputes and minority ethnicities), and especially North Vietnam. Besides, the RVN also focused on diplomatic relations with other Asian countries to secure its international recognition.

Diệm&#x27;s attitude toward India was not harmonious due to India&#x27;s non-alignment policy, which Diệm assumed favored communism. It was not until in 1962, when India voted for a report criticizing the communists for supporting the invasion of South Vietnam, that Diệm eventually reviewed his opinions toward India. For Japan, Diệm&#x27;s regime established diplomatic relations for the recognition of war reparations, which led to a reparation agreement in 1959 with the amount of US$49 million (equivalent to US$514 million in 2023). Diệm also established friendly relations with non-communist states, especially South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Laos and the Federation of Malaya, where Diệm&#x27;s regime shared the common recognition of communist threats.

Regarding the relations with communist North Vietnam, Diệm maintained total hostility and never made a serious effort to establish any relations with it. In relations with France, as an anti-colonialism nationalist, Diệm did not believe in France and France was always a negative factor in his foreign policy. He also never &quot;looked up on France as a counterweight to American influence&quot;.

Concerning relations with the US, although Diệm admitted the importance of the US-RVN alliance, he perceived that the US&#x27;s assistance to the RVN was primarily serving its own national interest, rather than the RVN&#x27;s national interest. Taylor adds that Diệm&#x27;s distrust of the US grew because of its Laotian policy, which gave North Vietnam access to South Vietnam&#x27;s border through southern Laos. Diệm also feared the escalation of American military personnel in South Vietnam, which threatened his nationalist credentials and the independence of his government. In early 1963, the Ngô brothers even revised their alliance with the US. Moreover, they also disagreed with the US on how to best react to the threat from North Vietnam. While Diệm believed that before opening the political system for the participation of other political camps, military, and security matters should be taken into account; the US wanted otherwise and was critical of Diệm&#x27;s clientelistic government, where political power based on his family members and trusted associates. The Buddhist crisis in South Vietnam decreased American confidence in Diệm, and eventually led to the coup d&#x27;état sanctioned by the US. Ultimately, nation-building politics &quot;shaped the evolution and collapse of the US-Diem alliance&quot;. The different visions in the meanings of concepts – democracy, community, security, and social change – were substantial, and were a key cause of the strains throughout their alliance.

==Coup and assassination==

As the Buddhist crisis deepened in July 1963, non-communist Vietnamese nationalists and the military began preparations for a coup. Bùi Diễm, later South Vietnam&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States, reported in his memoirs that General Lê Văn Kim requested his aid in learning what the United States might do about Diệm&#x27;s government. Diễm had contacts in both the embassy and with the high-profile American journalists then in South Vietnam, David Halberstam (&quot;New York Times&quot;), Neil Sheehan (United Press International), and Malcolm Browne (Associated Press).

The coup d&#x27;état was designed by a military revolutionary council including ARVN generals led by General Dương Văn Minh. Lieutenant Colonel Lucien Conein, a CIA officer, had become a liaison between the US Embassy and the generals, who were led by Trần Văn Đôn, and they met each other for the first time on 2 October 1963, at Tân Sơn Nhất airport. Three days later, Conein met with General Dương Văn Minh to discuss the coup and the stance of the US towards it. Conein then delivered the White House&#x27;s message of American non-intervention, which was reiterated by Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the U.S. ambassador, who gave secret assurances to the generals that the United States would not interfere.

The coup was chiefly planned by the Vietnamese generals. Unlike the coup in 1960, the plotters of the 1963 coup knew how to gain broad support from other ARVN officer corps. They obtained the support of Generals Tôn Thất Đính, Đỗ Cao Trí, and Nguyễn Khánh of the III, II, and I Corps respectively. However, commander of the IV Corps Huỳnh Văn Cao remained loyal to Diệm.

On 1 November 1963, Conein donned his military uniform and stuffed three million Vietnamese piastres into a bag to be given to General Minh. Conein then called the CIA station and gave a signal indicating that the planned coup against Diệm was about to start. Minh and his co-conspirators swiftly overthrew the government.
With only the palace guard remaining to defend Diệm and his younger brother Nhu, the generals called the palace offering Diệm exile if he surrendered. That evening, however, Diệm and his entourage escaped via an underground passage to Cha Tam Catholic Church in Cholon, where they were captured the following morning. On 2 November 1963, the brothers were assassinated together in the back of an M113 armored personnel carrier with a bayonet and revolver by Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, under orders from Minh . Diệm was buried in an unmarked grave in Mạc Đĩnh Chi Cemetery. In 1983 the Vietnamese government closed the cemetery, and ordered all remains to be exhumed and removed. Diệm and his brother were reburied in .

==Aftermath==
Upon learning of Diệm&#x27;s ouster and assassination, Hồ Chí Minh reportedly stated: &quot;I can scarcely believe the Americans would be so stupid&quot;. The North Vietnamese Politburo was more explicit:The consequences of the 1 November coup d&#x27;état will be contrary to the calculations of the US imperialists ... Diệm was one of the strongest individuals resisting the people and Communism. Everything that could be done in an attempt to crush the revolution was carried out by Diệm. Diệm was one of the most competent lackeys of the US imperialists  ... Among the anti-Communists in South Vietnam or exiled in other countries, no one has sufficient political assets and abilities to cause others to obey. Therefore, the lackey administration cannot be stabilized. The coup d&#x27;état on 1 November 1963 will not be the last.

After Diệm&#x27;s assassination, South Vietnam was unable to establish a stable government and several coups took place. While the United States continued to influence South Vietnam&#x27;s government, the assassination bolstered North Vietnamese attempts to characterize the South Vietnamese as &quot;supporters of colonialism&quot;.

==Legacy==
Diệm&#x27;s assassination led to the collapse of his regime and to the end of the first Republic of Vietnam. Nevertheless, his contribution over his nine years of power from 1954 to 1963 can be appreciated at many levels by his part in resolving the northern refugees issue, establishing and consolidating the power of his regime, subduing the sects, and pacifying the country. Diệm stabilized an independent South Vietnam, which had suffered in the First Indochina War, and built a relatively stable government in Saigon in the late 1950s. The normality and domestic security created conditions for economic recovery and the development of education in South Vietnam, which contributed educated human resources to serve the nation.

According to historian Philip Catton, Diệm was first and foremost a Vietnamese nationalist who was wary of dependence on the United States and &quot;feared the Americans nearly as much as the Communist insurgents&quot;. Diệm constantly clashed with his American advisors over policies and had a completely different understanding of both democracy and Catholic values in comparison to the West. Keith Taylor argues that while Diệm&#x27;s rule was authoritarian, it was also necessary given the precarious situation of the south. The South Vietnamese army would gradually gain experience and skill in both warfare and intelligence under Diệm&#x27;s command, and his assassination turned the tide in favor of the north, with the subsequent governments proving inefficient and incapable of organising successful resistance to Viet Cong advances. According to Edward Miller, Diệm was greatly autonomous from the United States and that Diệm was neither an outstandingly authoritarian nor excessively corrupt leader, questioning the notion that Diệm&#x27;s main agenda was to increase his family&#x27;s power.

<text>Cuscuta (), commonly known as dodder or amarbel, is a genus of over 201 species of yellow, orange, or red (rarely green) parasitic plants. Formerly treated as the only genus in the family Cuscutaceae, it now is accepted as belonging in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae, on the basis of the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the greatest species diversity in subtropical and tropical regions; the genus becomes rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.

Folk names include strangle tare, strangleweed, scaldweed, beggarweed, lady&#x27;s laces, fireweed, wizard&#x27;s net, devil&#x27;s guts, devil&#x27;s hair, devil&#x27;s ringlet, goldthread, hailweed, hairweed, hellbine, love vine, pull-down, angel hair, and witch&#x27;s hair.

==Description==

Cuscuta can be identified by its thin stems appearing leafless, with the leaves reduced to minute scales. In these respects it closely resembles the similarly parasitic, but unrelated genus, &quot;Cassytha&quot;. From mid-summer to early autumn, the vines can produce small fruit that take the same color as the vine, and are approximately the size of a common pea. It has very low levels of chlorophyll; some species such as &quot;Cuscuta reflexa&quot; can photosynthesize slightly, while others such as &quot;C. europaea&quot; are entirely dependent on the host plants for nutrition.

Dodder flowers range in color from white to pink to yellow to cream. Some flower in the early summer, others later, depending on the species. The seeds are minute and produced in large quantities. They have a hard coating, and typically can survive in the soil for 5–10 years, sometimes longer.

Dodder seeds sprout at or near the surface of the soil. Although dodder germination can occur without a host, it has to reach a green plant quickly and is adapted to grow towards the nearby plants by following chemosensory clues. If a plant is not reached within 5 to 10 days of germination, the dodder seedling will die. Before a host plant is reached, the dodder, as other plants, relies on food reserves in the embryo; the cotyledons, though present, are vestigial.
==Parasitism==
After a dodder attaches itself to a plant, it wraps itself around it. If the host contains food beneficial to dodder, the dodder produces haustoria that insert themselves into the vascular system of the host. The vestigial root of the dodder in the soil then dies. The dodder can grow and attach itself to multiple plants. In tropical areas, it can grow more or less continuously and may reach high into the canopy of shrubs and trees; in cold temperate regions, it is an annual plant and is restricted to relatively low vegetation that can be reached by new seedlings each spring.

Dodder is parasitic on a very wide variety of plants, including a number of agricultural and horticultural crop species, such as alfalfa, lespedeza, flax, clover, potatoes, chrysanthemum, dahlia, helenium, trumpet vine, ivy and petunias. It is an ectoparasite and is categorized as holoparasitic plant, or a plant that is non-photosynthetic and is completely dependent on a host.

Dodder ranges in severity based on its species and the species of the host, the time of attack, and whether any viruses are also present in the host plant. By debilitating the host plant, dodder decreases the ability of plants to resist viral diseases, and dodder can also spread plant diseases from one host to another if it is attached to more than one plant. This is of economic concern in agricultural systems, where an annual drop of 10% yield can be devastating. There has been an emphasis on dodder vine control in order to manage plant diseases in the field.


==Host location==
A report published in &quot;Science&quot; in 2006 demonstrated that dodder use airborne volatile organic compound cues to locate their host plants. Seedlings of &quot;C. pentagona&quot; exhibit positive growth responses to volatiles released by tomato and other species of host plants. When given a choice between volatiles released by the preferred host tomato and the non-host wheat, the parasite grew toward the former. Further experiments demonstrated attraction to a number of individual compounds released by host plants and repellence by one compound released by wheat. These results do not rule out the possibility that other cues, such as light, may also play a role in host location.

==Host defenses==
Less is known about host defenses against dodder and other parasitic plants than is known about plant defenses against herbivores and pathogens. In one study, tomato plants were found to employ complex mechanisms to defend against dodder. Two pathways, using jasmonic acid and salicylic acid, were activated in response to attack by &quot;Cuscuta pentagona&quot;. Dodder attack was also found to induce production of volatiles, including 2-carene, α-pinene, limonene, and β-phellandrene. It is not known if or how these volatiles defend the host, but they could potentially interfere with the dodder&#x27;s ability to locate and select hosts. Also, the presence of trichomes on the tomato stem effectively blocks the dodder from attaching to the stem.

==Prevention and treatment==
Many countries have laws prohibiting import of dodder seed, requiring crop seeds to be free of dodder seed contamination. Before planting, all clothes should be inspected for dodder seed when moving from an infested area to a non-infested crop. When dealing with an infested area, swift action is necessary. Recommendations include planting a non-host crop for several years after the infestation, pulling up host crops immediately, particularly before the dodder produces seed, and use of preemergent herbicides such as Dacthal in the spring. Examples of non-host crops include grasses and many other monocotyledons. If dodder is found before it chokes a host plant, it may be simply removed from the soil. If choking has begun, the host plant must be pruned significantly below the dodder infestation, as dodder is versatile and able to grow back from its haustoria.

==Use in Chinese traditional medicine==

&quot;C. chinensis&quot; seeds () have long been used for osteoporosis in China and some other Asian countries. &quot;C. chinensis&quot; is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine which is believed to strengthen the liver and kidneys. Cuscuta species are also used as medicine in Himalayan regional medical traditions.

<text>The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) is a post–Cold War, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) institution. The EAPC is a multilateral forum created to improve relations between NATO and non-NATO countries in Europe and Central Asia. States meet to cooperate and discuss political and security issues. It was formed on 29 May 1997 at a Ministers’ meeting held in Sintra, Portugal, as the successor to the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), which was created in 1991.

The EAPC provides an overall political framework for NATO’s cooperation with its partner countries in the Euro-Atlantic area. It works alongside the Partnership for Peace (PfP), which was created in January 1994. There are 50 members, including all 32 NATO member countries and 18 Partnership for Peace countries. Of its members, the United States has had a notable role in the council. In the post-Cold War era, the United States served as one of the key members of the EAPC that continued to push for engagement with Russia, which is an EAPC partner country.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus were suspended from the Council.

== Background ==
=== The NACC and PfP ===
The EAPC serves as a successor of the NACC. The NACC, established in 1991, was created with the intention of being a forum of discussion and cooperation with NATO’s former Warsaw Pact adversaries. The NACC allowed for multilateral political consultation and cooperation, which helped build confidence in the early 1990s. Additionally, the NACC paved the way for the launch of the PfP in 1994. NATO launched the PfP with the goal of forging a real partnership of peace, instead of simply engaging in the dialogue. Its role was to expand and intensify political and military cooperation throughout Europe, increase stability, diminish threats to peace, and build relationships. However, the PfP needed the assistance of another organization, such as the EAPC, to work on these tasks.

By 1997, the Allies involved in the NACC recognized the desire to build a security forum that would include other Western European partners. Partners were beginning to deepen cooperation with NATO, and support for defence reform and transitions towards democracy were increasing. They needed a forum that was larger and better suited for increasingly sophisticated relationships, and therefore the EAPC succeeded the NACC in 1997. 

=== Role and structure ===

In addition to providing the overall political framework for cooperation, the EAPC provides a framework for the bilateral relationship developed between NATO and individual partner countries under the PfP program. The EAPC’s actions are based on two-year action plans. These focus on consultation and cooperation on a range of political and security related issues. Under the EAPC, the ambassadors meet monthly while the foreign and defense ministers meet annually. The council&#x27;s role is to maintain long-term consultation and cooperation; do crisis management and peace support operations; deal with regional issues; arms control; issues related to the proliferation of weapons and mass destruction; and international terrorism. On the defence level, the EAPC is responsible for planning, budgeting, policy and strategy, civil emergency planning, disaster preparedness, nuclear safety, air control, and scientific discovery. In addition to this, the EAPC is tasked with promoting and coordinating practical cooperation and exchange of expertise in key areas such as combatting terrorism, border security, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and small arms. NATO and EAPC’s policies have agreed to support international efforts in regards to the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, and combating human trafficking. 

=== Security forums ===
On May 24-25th, 2005, the EAPC held its first Security Forum in Are, Sweden. It brought together Ministers and senior decision-makers from NATO and partner countries; and representatives of civil society and think tanks. Its goal was to engage with civil society and recognize the role NGOs play in NATO’s agenda regarding peace-building and reconstruction, particularly in areas of the Balkans and Afghanistan. NATO noted that delegates had the opportunity to hold deeper discussions on Euro-Atlantic issues compared to regular ministerial meetings.

In June 2007, the second Forum was held in Ohrid, Republic of Macedonia. Its focus was finding a comprehensive approach to Afghanistan, energy security, and integrating the Balkans into the Euro-Atlantic structure. The Forum included Ministers, senior officials, parliamentarians, academics, NGOs, and journalists. Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, the Secretary-General of NATO stated that they wanted participants from a range of professional backgrounds to bring about ideas, have open discussions, and understand different perspectives.

 Russia and Belarus are currently suspended due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Belarus being suspended because it has allowed the Russian military to use its territory to attack Ukraine.

== USA involvement in the EAPC ==
The USA served as one of the founding members of the NACC, the predecessor of the EAPC, in December 1991. Following the collapse of the NACC and the fusion of the PfP and the EAPC, the United States continued to serve on the EAPC as one of its key members.

In the post-Cold War era, The USA objective was to express more global interests in confronting crises and challenges. USA officials remained hopeful that cooperation with Russia was possible. According to Ingrid Lundestad, the inclusion of Russia within the EAPC was understood to provide reconciliation and stability to the United States and the Euro-Atlantic region.

The promotion of democracy and market economics serves as an incentive for the United States to be involved in the EAPC. Greater European integration in the United States, combined with a persistent transatlantic bond, is one of the greatest motivators for the United States to be involved in the EAPC.

== Russia and the EAPC ==
In the early 1990s, NATO Allies took several steps to engage Moscow in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership. They wished to promote democratic and economic reforms in the Euro-Atlantic area, particularly with Russia following a Cold-War period. Russia serves as a partner country in the EAPC. Their involvement can be traced to the first meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council on December 20, 1991. The meeting took place with NATO, Eastern European nations, and the USSR present. Near the end of this meeting, the Soviet Ambassador received a message that as the meeting was taking place, the Soviet Union would cease to exist the following day. The Soviet Ambassador noted at that point that he would only be representing the Russian Federation, and no longer the Soviet Union.

By 1994, Russia joined the Partnership for Peace (PfP), strengthening the ties between Russia and NATO. Upon the fusion of the PfP and NACC, Russia automatically became a member of the EAPC in 1997. The same year, the NATO-Russia Founding Act was also signed, showing cooperation following a Cold-War era. While Russia primarily rejected the notion of an alliance, rather embracing practical cooperation with NATO and its organizations such as the Euro-Atlantic Partnership, in the 1990s Russia signed and engaged with a number of partnerships with NATO, such as the NATO-Russia Partnership Commission (NRC), which, in 1997, turned into the NATO-Russia Standing Joint Commission.

According to Vladimir Baranovsky, Russia’s objectives with the EAPC fall largely in the desire to promote security. Baranovsky says that Russia’s initiatives include stabilizing Europe, promoting cooperation and interaction between Europe in ‘traditional’ security-related areas and in new ideas, and narrowing differences over political and legal interpretations of Europe’s security. He also says that the most cooperative method to enhance traditional security is a three-way partnership with the United States, Russia, and NATO, and Russia is able to find this in the EAPC. Arms control in Europe is also discussed within the Council, and Russia finds an additional incentive to be a part of the EAPC due to this.

As explored in Russia and the EAPC section, the EAPC has previously served as a ‘reset’ in US-Russia relations, and by extension NATO-Russia relations.

Today, the EAPC members continue to engage in partnership and dialogue. It has maintained a focus on security, stability, and democratic transformation in the Euro-Atlantic region.

<doc id="54023" wikidata="Q344902" url="?curid=54023" title="Peter Bonetti">
<text>Peter Philip Bonetti (27 September 1941 – 12 April 2020) was an English professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Chelsea, the St. Louis Stars, Dundee United and England. He was known for his safe handling, lightning reflexes and his graceful style, for which he was given the nickname &quot;The Cat&quot;. He was one of several goalkeepers (Gordon West of Everton was another) who specialised in a one-armed throw which could achieve a similar distance to a drop kick.

Bonetti played seven times for England, but mainly served the team as a back-up to Gordon Banks; he was part of the winning England squad for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but did not play. He belatedly received a winners&#x27; medal in 2009, after the Football Association led a successful campaign for non-playing members of the squad to be recognised. After Banks fell ill before the 1970 FIFA World Cup quarter-final, Bonetti played as England lost 3–2 to West Germany.

==Early life==
Bonetti was born in Putney, southwest London. His family moved to Worthing, Sussex in 1948. His parents ran a café on the seafront next to the Dome Cinema. They were Swiss-Italian emigrants from Ticino. Bonetti attended St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Worthing. He shone at an early age, playing for Worthing.

==Club career==
===Chelsea===
Chelsea signed him from the Reading youth team after his mother had written to manager Ted Drake, requesting that he give her son a trial. Whilst a Chelsea junior, Bonetti made five appearances for Croydon Amateurs in the Surrey Senior League thanks to youth team coach Albert Tennant who was also coaching Croydon at that time. He made his first team debut in 1960, and a few weeks later helped the Chelsea youth team win the FA Youth Cup. From the 1960–61 season onward he was Chelsea&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper, a position he held more-or-less constantly for the next nineteen years.

Chelsea were relegated in Bonetti&#x27;s second full season, which saw the appointment of Tommy Docherty as manager. Bonetti emerged as a key figure in a talented young team which included Bobby Tambling, Terry Venables, John Hollins and Barry Bridges. The team went into the penultimate match of the season needing to beat promotion rivals Sunderland to have a chance of going up. Chelsea won 1–0, with Bonetti making a brilliant last minute save to deny George Mulhall and maintain his team&#x27;s promotion chances; a 7–0 win over Portsmouth secured instant promotion back to the First Division.

The new Chelsea team challenged for honours during the 1960s, with Bonetti a key figure throughout, although more often than not the team narrowly missed out. The club won the League Cup in 1965 with a 3–2 aggregate victory over Leicester City. Leicester put Chelsea under heavy pressure in the second leg at Filbert Street, but an inspired performance from Bonetti helped secure a 0–0 draw, and thus the trophy for his team. For most of that season Chelsea were on course to add both the league title and the FA Cup, but ultimately missed out. They were beaten by Liverpool in the FA Cup; meanwhile, their title challenge ended with a few matches left, following a bust-up between Docherty and several of his first-team players (though not Bonetti). The disunity behind the scenes meant that a much-weakened team was fielded in a key match against Burnley, in which Bonetti conceded six goals.

Bonetti played in every match of Chelsea&#x27;s Inter-Cities Fairs Cup run the following season, putting in a series of impressive displays against the likes of Roma, A.C. Milan and Barcelona, though the team was eventually knocked out in the semi-final, as they were in the FA Cup for the second consecutive year. The signing of Alex Stepney at the end of that season briefly threatened his position as Chelsea&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper, and he considered putting in a transfer request, but Stepney ultimately made only one appearance for the club and was sold to Manchester United a few months later. Chelsea eventually reached an FA Cup final in 1967, where they faced Tottenham Hotspur, but the team got outplayed on the day and Bonetti could do little to stop Spurs winning 2–1.

That was the closest he came to winning another trophy with Chelsea until 1970, by which time Docherty had been succeeded by Dave Sexton. In 1970, Chelsea again reached the FA Cup final and this time faced reigning league champions Leeds United. Over the two fiercely contested matches, Bonetti had what was perhaps the finest moment of his playing career. Chelsea were outplayed for large spells in the first final at Wembley Stadium and he made a series of crucial saves to help them emerge with a 2–2 draw. Shortly into the replay at Old Trafford, his left knee was badly injured after a challenge from Leeds&#x27; Mick Jones. He returned to the field after treatment, but was effectively playing on one leg for the rest of the match and was powerless to stop Jones scoring the opener a few minutes later. In spite of the injury, and being targeted by the Leeds forwards, he made crucial saves throughout the match, denying both Peter Lorimer and Terry Cooper, and resisted more pressure from Leeds after Chelsea had taken the lead in extra time to help secure a 2–1 win. Such were Bonetti&#x27;s performances that season, he was voted runner-up in the FWA Footballer of the Year awards.

A year later, the team added the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup after another replayed win in the final, this time over Spanish giants Real Madrid in Athens. Chelsea took a 2–0 lead in the replay, but Real dominated for much of the second half and it was another inspired performance from Bonetti that helped them hold on for a 2–1 win.

That was his last trophy with the club, although they narrowly missed out on more in the following years, losing in the 1972 League Cup final to Stoke City and in the semi-final of the same competition to Norwich City a year later. Financial and disciplinary problems within the club prevented them from building on their success.

===St Louis Stars===
Bonetti left on a free transfer in 1975, joining the St. Louis Stars of the North American Soccer League. That year, he made 21 appearances for the team and helped them top the Central Division that summer and reach the play-off semi-final.

===Return to Chelsea===
He then returned to Chelsea, where his experience proved invaluable in helping new manager Eddie McCreadie&#x27;s young team gain promotion in 1976–77. Two years later, in May 1979, he played his final appearance for Chelsea, a 1–1 draw with Arsenal, having made a total of 729 appearances for the club in nineteen years – only Ron Harris has made more – and kept over 200 clean sheets. He conceded one goal or less in two-thirds of his appearances for Chelsea.

==International career==
Bonetti earned seven caps for England, kept out of the team by Gordon Banks. He was a member of England&#x27;s successful 1966 FIFA World Cup squad, but did not make an appearance.

Bonetti&#x27;s England career is largely remembered for one match – the 1970 FIFA World Cup quarter-final against West Germany in Mexico. He was thrust into the starting line-up as a late replacement for Banks, who was suffering from severe food poisoning. During the match England relinquished a 2–0 second-half lead and lost 3–2 after extra time. Bonetti received a large amount of blame from the public for the loss, and never played for England again.

In the 1966 World Cup final only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the 4–2 win over West Germany received medals. Following a Football Association-led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to all winning squad members, Bonetti was presented with his medal by prime minister Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009.

==Retirement==
After leaving Chelsea, Bonetti moved to the Isle of Mull where he ran a guesthouse and became a postman. While living in Scotland, he briefly came out of retirement to make several appearances for Dundee United as understudy to Hamish McAlpine. Following his retirement from playing, Bonetti moved into coaching and had spells with Chelsea and the England national team, as well as working with Kevin Keegan at Newcastle United, Fulham and Manchester City.

During his time as a Chelsea coach, he was persuaded to play two matches for Isthmian League Division Two club Woking, including an FA Cup debut in a 1–0 win over Football Conference team Weymouth. At one time he held the record for the most appearances for a single club by a goalkeeper, but was overtaken in the 1990s by Portsmouth&#x27;s Alan Knight.

Since 2005, Bonetti made several appearances for an Old England XI in various charity matches, notably against celebrity teams, usually coming on for the last 10 minutes of each match.

Bonetti died on 12 April 2020, aged 78, following a long illness. On 18 April 2022, his ashes were left behind the goal at the Shed End at Stamford Bridge.

<text>In the field of jurisprudence, equity is the particular body of law, developed in the English Court of Chancery, with the general purpose of providing legal remedies for cases wherein the common law is inflexible and cannot fairly resolve the disputed legal matter. Conceptually, equity was part of the historical origins of the system of common law of England, yet is a field of law separate from common law, because equity has its own unique rules and principles, and was administered by courts of equity. 

Equity exists in domestic law, both in civil law and in common law systems, as well as in international law. The tradition of equity begins in antiquity with the writings of Aristotle (&quot;epieikeia&quot;) and with Roman law (&quot;aequitas&quot;). Later, in civil law systems, equity was integrated in the legal rules, while in common law systems it became an independent body of law.

== Equity in common law jurisdictions (general) ==
In jurisdictions following the English common law system, equity is the body of law which was developed in the English Court of Chancery and which is now administered concurrently with the common law. In common law jurisdictions, the word &quot;equity&quot; &quot;is not a synonym for &#x27;general fairness&#x27; or &#x27;natural justice, but refers to &quot;a particular body of rules that originated in a special system of courts&quot;.

For much of its history, the English common law was principally developed and administered in the central royal courts: the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Exchequer. Equity was the name given to the law which was administered in the Court of Chancery. The Judicature Acts of the 1870s effected a procedural fusion of the two bodies of law, ending their institutional separation. The reforms did not fuse the actual bodies of law however. As an example, this lack of fusion meant it was still not possible to receive an equitable remedy for a purely common law wrong. Judicial or academic reasoning which assumes the contrary has been described as a &quot;fusion fallacy&quot;.

Jurisdictions which have inherited the common law system differ in their treatment of equity. Over the course of the twentieth century some common law systems began to place less emphasis on the historical or institutional origin of substantive legal rules. In England and Wales, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, equity remains a distinct body of law. Modern equity includes, among other things:

* the law relating to express, resulting, and constructive trusts;
* fiduciary law;
* equitable estoppel (including promissory and proprietary estoppel);
* relief against penalties and relief against forfeiture;
* the doctrines of contribution, subrogation and marshalling; and
* equitable set-off.

&quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot;, 10th ed., definition 4, differentiates &quot;common law&quot; (or just &quot;law&quot;) from &quot;equity&quot;. Before 1873, England had two complementary court systems: courts of &quot;law&quot; which could only award money damages and recognized only the legal owner of property, and courts of &quot;equity&quot; (courts of chancery) that could issue injunctive relief (that is, a court order to a party to do something, give something to someone, or stop doing something) and recognized trusts of property. This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States. The states of Delaware, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee continue to have divided Courts of Law and Courts of Chancery. In New Jersey, the appellate courts are unified, but the trial courts are organized into a Chancery Division and a Law Division. There is a difference of opinion in Commonwealth countries as to whether equity and common law have been fused or are merely administered by the same court, with the orthodox view that they have not (expressed as rejecting the &quot;fusion fallacy&quot;) prevailing in Australia, while support for fusion has been expressed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal.

For most purposes, the U.S. federal system and most states have merged the two courts.

The latter part of the twentieth century saw increased debate over the utility of treating equity as a separate body of law. These debates were labelled the &quot;fusion wars&quot;. A particular flashpoint in this debate centred on the concept of unjust enrichment and whether areas of law traditionally regarded as equitable could be rationalised as part of a single body of law known as the law of unjust enrichment.

=== History of equity in common law jurisdictions ===
After the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th century, royal justice came to be administered in three central courts: the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Exchequer. The common law developed in these royal courts, which were created by the authority of the King of England, and whose jurisdiction over disputes between the King&#x27;s subjects was based upon the King&#x27;s writ. Initially, a writ was probably a vague order to do right by the plaintiff, and it was usually a writ of grace, issued at the pleasure of the King.

During the 12th and 13th centuries, writ procedure gradually evolved into something much more rigid. All writs to commence actions had to be purchased by litigants from the Chancery, the head of which was the Lord Chancellor. After writs began to become more specific and creative (in terms of the relief sought), Parliament responded in 1258 by providing in the Provisions of Oxford that the Chancellor could no longer create new writs without permission from the King and the King&#x27;s Council (the curia regis). Pursuant to this authorization, litigants could purchase certain enumerated writs (as a matter of course) which later became known as writs (as a matter of right). Each of these writs was associated with particular circumstances and led to a particular kind of judgment. Procedure in the common law courts became tightly focused on the form of action (the particular procedure authorized by a particular writ to enforce a particular substantive right), rather than what modern lawyers would now call the cause of action (the underlying substantive right to be enforced).

Because the writ system was limited to enumerated writs for enumerated rights and wrongs, it sometimes produced unjust results. Thus, even though the King&#x27;s Bench might have jurisdiction over a case and might have the power to issue the perfect writ, the plaintiff might still not have a case if there was not a single form of action combining them. Lacking a legal remedy, the plaintiff&#x27;s only option would be to petition the King.

Litigants began to seek relief against unfair judgments of the common law courts by petitioning the King. Such petitions were initially processed by the King&#x27;s Council, which itself was quite overworked, and the Council began to delegate the hearing of such petitions to the Lord Chancellor. This delegation is often justified by the fact that the Lord Chancellor was literally the Keeper of the King&#x27;s Conscience, although Francis Palgrave argued that the delegation was initially driven by practical concerns and the moral justification came later. The moral justification went as follows: as Keeper of the King&#x27;s Conscience, the Chancellor &quot;would act in particular cases to admit &#x27;merciful exceptions&#x27; to the King&#x27;s general laws to ensure that the King&#x27;s conscience was right before God&quot;. This concern for the King&#x27;s conscience was then extended to the conscience of the defendant in Chancery, in that the Chancellor would intervene to prevent &quot;unconscionable&quot; conduct on the part of the defendant, in order to protect the conscience of the King. 

By the 14th century, it appears that Chancery was operating as a court, affording remedies for which the strict procedures of the common law worked injustice or provided no remedy to a deserving plaintiff. Chancellors often had theological and clerical training and were well versed in Roman law and canon law. During this era, the Roman concept of influenced the development of the distinctly different but related English concept of equity: &quot;The equity administered by the early English chancellors ... [was] confessedly borrowed from the aequitas and the judicial powers of the Roman magistrates.&quot; By the 15th century, the judicial power of Chancery was clearly recognised. 

Early Chancery pleadings vaguely invoked some sort of higher justice, such as with the formula &quot;for the love of God and in way of charity&quot;. During the 15th century, Chancery pleadings began to expressly invoke &quot;conscience&quot;, to the point that English lawyers in the late 15th century thought of Chancery as a court of &quot;conscience&quot;, not a court of &quot;equity&quot;. However, the &quot;reasoning of the medieval chancellors has not been preserved&quot; as to what they actually meant by the word &quot;conscience&quot;, and modern scholars can only indirectly guess at what the word probably meant. The publication of the treatise &quot;The Doctor and Student&quot; in the early 16th century marked the beginning of Chancery&#x27;s transformation from a court of conscience to a court of equity. 

Before that point in time, the word &quot;equity&quot; was used in the common law to refer to a principle of statutory interpretation derived from : the idea that written laws ought to be interpreted &quot;according to the intention rather than the letter&quot; of the law. What was new was the application of the word &quot;equity&quot; to &quot;the extraordinary form of justice administered by the chancellor&quot;, as a convenient way to distinguish Chancery jurisprudence from the common law.

A common criticism of Chancery practice as it developed in the early medieval period was that it lacked fixed rules, varied greatly from Chancellor to Chancellor, and the Chancellor was exercising an unbounded discretion. The counterargument was that equity mitigated the rigour of the common law by looking to substance rather than to form.

The early chancellors were influenced by their training in theology and canon law, but the law of equity they applied was not canon law, but a new kind of law purportedly driven by conscience. Whatever it meant in the medieval era, the word &quot;conscience&quot; clearly carried a subjective connotation (as it still does today). Complaints about equity as an arbitrary exercise of conscience by nonlawyer Chancellors became quite frequent under the chancellorship of Thomas Wolsey (1515–1529), who &quot;had no legal training, and delighted in putting down lawyers&quot;. 

In 1546, Chancellor Thomas Wriothesley, a nonlawyer, was accused of trying to inject the civil law into Chancery. This was a &quot;wild exaggeration&quot;, but as a result, the Crown began to transition away from clergy and nonlawyers and instead appointed only lawyers trained in the common law tradition to the position of Lord Chancellor (although there were six more nonlawyer chancellors in the decades after Wriothesley). The last person without training in the common law before 2016 to serve as Lord Chancellor was Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, who served briefly from 1672 to 1673. (Liz Truss was appointed as Lord Chancellor in 2016, but this was after the position had been stripped of its judicial powers by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, leaving the Chancellor of the High Court as the highest judge sitting in equity in England and Wales.)

The development of a court of equity as a remedy for the rigid procedure of the common law courts meant it was inevitable that the two systems would come into conflict. Litigants would go &quot;jurisdiction shopping&quot; and often would seek an equitable injunction prohibiting the enforcement of a common law court order. The penalty for disobeying an equitable injunction and enforcing an unconscionable common law judgment was imprisonment.

The 1615 conflict between common law and equity came about because of a &quot;clash of strong personalities&quot; between Lord Chancellor Ellesmere and the Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, Sir Edward Coke. Chief Justice Coke began the practice of issuing writs of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; that required the release of people imprisoned for contempt of chancery orders. This tension reached a climax in the Earl of Oxford&#x27;s case (1615) where a judgment of Chief Justice Coke was allegedly obtained by fraud. Chancellor Ellesmere issued an injunction from the Chancery prohibiting the enforcement of the common law order. The two courts became locked in a stalemate, and the matter was eventually referred to the Attorney General, Sir Francis Bacon. Sir Francis, by authority of King James I, upheld the use of the equitable injunction and concluded that in the event of any conflict between the common law and equity, equity would prevail.

Chancery continued to be the subject of extensive criticism, the most famous of which was 17th-century jurist John Selden&#x27;s aphorism:

After 1660, Chancery cases were regularly reported, several equitable doctrines developed, and equity started to evolve into a system of precedents like its common law cousin. Over time, equity jurisprudence would gradually become a &quot;body of equitable law, as complex, doctrinal, and rule-haunted as the common law ever was&quot;.

One indicator of equity&#x27;s evolution into a coherent body of law was Lord Eldon&#x27;s response to Selden in an 1818 chancery case: &quot;I cannot agree that the doctrines of this court are to be changed with every succeeding judge. Nothing would inflict on me greater pain, in quitting this place, than the recollection that I had done anything to justify the reproach that the equity of this court varies like the Chancellor&#x27;s foot.&quot;

Equity&#x27;s primacy over common law in England was later enshrined in the Judicature Acts of the 1870s, which also served to fuse the courts of equity and the common law (although emphatically not the systems themselves) into one unified court system.

=== Statute of Uses 1535 ===

One area in which the Court of Chancery assumed a vital role was the enforcement of uses, a role that the rigid framework of land law could not accommodate. This role gave rise to the basic distinction between legal and equitable interests.

In order to avoid paying land taxes and other feudal dues, lawyers developed a primitive form of trust called the &quot;use&quot; that enabled one person (who was not required to pay tax) to hold the legal title of the land for the use of another person. The effect of this trust was that the first person owned the land under the common law, but the second person had a right to use the land under the law of equity.

Henry VIII enacted the Statute of Uses in 1535 (which became effective in 1536) in an attempt to outlaw this practice and recover lost revenue. The Act effectively made the beneficial owner of the land the legal owner and therefore liable for feudal dues.

The response of the lawyers to this Statute was to create the &quot;use upon a use&quot;. The Statute recognized only the first use, and so land owners were again able to separate the legal and beneficial interests in their land.

== Comparison of equity traditions in common law countries ==
=== Australia ===

Equity remains a cornerstone of Australian private law. A string of cases in the 1980s saw the High Court of Australia re-affirm the continuing vitality of traditional equitable doctrines. In 2009 the High Court affirmed the importance of equity and dismissed the suggestion that unjust enrichment has explanatory power in relation to traditional equitable doctrines such as subrogation.

The state of New South Wales is particularly well known for the strength of its Equity jurisprudence. However, it was only in 1972 with the introduction of reform to the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) that empowered both the Equity and Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of NSW to grant relief in either equity or common law. In 1972 NSW also adopted one of the essential sections of the Judicature reforms, which emphasised that where there was a conflict between the common law and equity, equity would always prevail. Nevertheless, in 1975 three alumni of Sydney Law School and judges of the NSW Supreme Court, Roddy Meagher, William Gummow and John Lehane produced &quot;&quot;. It remains one of the most highly regarded practitioner texts in Australia and England. The work is now in its 5th edition and edited by Dyson Heydon, former Justice of the High Court, Justice Mark Leeming of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, and Dr Peter Turner of Cambridge University.

==== England and Wales ====
Equity remains a distinct part of the law of England and Wales. The main challenge to it has come from academic writers working within the law of unjust enrichment. Scholars such as Peter Birks and Andrew Burrows argue that in many cases the inclusion of the label &quot;legal&quot; or &quot;equitable&quot; before a substantive rule is often unnecessary. Many English universities, such as Oxford and Cambridge, continue to teach Equity as a standalone subject. Leading practitioner texts include &quot;Snell&#x27;s Equity&quot;, &quot;Lewin on Trusts&quot;, and &quot;Hayton &amp; Underhill&#x27;s Law of Trusts and Trustees&quot;.

Limits on the power of equity in English law were clarified by the House of Lords in &quot;The Scaptrade&quot; case (&quot;Scandinavian Trading Tanker Co. A.B. v Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana&quot; [1983] 2 AC 694, 700), where the notion that the court&#x27;s jurisdiction to grant relief was &quot;unlimited and unfettered&quot; (per Lord Simon of Glaisdale in &quot;Shiloh Spinners Ltd v. Harding&quot; [1973] A.C. 691, 726) was rejected as a &quot;beguiling heresy&quot;.

==== Scotland ====

The courts of Scotland have never recognised a division between the normal common law and equity, and as such the Court of Session (the supreme civil court of Scotland) has exercised an equitable and inherent jurisdiction and called the . The enables the Court to provide a legal remedy where statute or the common law are silent, and prevent mistakes in procedure or practice that would lead to injustice. The exercise of this power is limited by adherence to precedent, and when legislation or the common law already specify the relevant remedy. Thus, the Court cannot set aside a statutory power, but can deal with situations where the law is silent, or where there is an omission in statute. Such an omission is sometimes termed a .

=== India ===

In India the common law doctrine of equity had traditionally been followed even after it became independent in 1947. However, in 1963 the Specific Relief Act was passed by the Parliament of India following the recommendation of the Law Commission of India and repealing the earlier &quot;Specific Relief Act&quot; of 1877. Under the 1963 Act, most equitable concepts were codified and made statutory rights, thereby ending the discretionary role of the courts to grant equitable reliefs. The rights codified under the 1963 Act were as under:
* Recovery of possession of immovable property (ss. 5–8)
* Specific performance of contracts (ss. 9–25)
* Rectification of instruments (s. 26)
* Recession of contracts (ss. 27–30)
* Cancellation of instruments (ss. 31–33)
* Declaratory decrees (ss. 34–35)
* Injunctions (ss. 36–42)

With this codification, the nature and tenure of the equitable reliefs available earlier have been modified to make them statutory rights and are also required to be pleaded specifically to be enforced. Further to the extent that these equitable reliefs have been codified into rights, they are no longer discretionary upon the courts or as the English law has it, &quot;Chancellor&#x27;s foot&quot; but instead are enforceable rights subject to the conditions under the 1963 Act being satisfied. Nonetheless, in the event of situations not covered under the 1963 Act, the courts in India continue to exercise their inherent powers in terms of Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which applies to all civil courts in India.

There is no such inherent powers with the criminal courts in India except with the High Courts in terms of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Further, such inherent powers are vested in the Supreme Court of India in terms of Article 142 of the Constitution of India which confers wide powers on the Supreme Court to pass orders &quot;as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause of matter pending before it&quot;.

=== United States ===

In modern practice, perhaps the most important distinction between law and equity is the set of remedies each offers. The most common civil remedy a court of law can award is monetary damages. Equity, however, enters injunctions or decrees directing someone either to act or to forbear from acting. Often, this form of relief is in practical terms more valuable to a litigant; for example, a plaintiff whose neighbor will not return his only milk cow, which had wandered onto the neighbor&#x27;s property, may want that particular cow back, not just its monetary value. However, in general, a litigant cannot obtain equitable relief unless there is &quot;no adequate remedy at law&quot;; that is, a court will not grant an injunction unless monetary damages are an insufficient remedy for the injury in question. Law courts can also enter certain types of immediately enforceable orders, called &quot;writs&quot; (such as a writ of habeas corpus), but they are less flexible and less easily obtained than an injunction.

Another distinction is the unavailability of a jury in equity: the judge is the trier of fact. In the American legal system, the right of jury trial in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment &quot;in Suits at common law&quot;, cases that traditionally would have been handled by the law courts. The question of whether a case should be determined by a jury depends largely on the type of relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder. On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an injunction, declaratory judgment, specific performance, modification of contract, or some other non-monetary relief, the claim would usually be one in equity.

Thomas Jefferson explained in 1785 that there are three main limitations on the power of a court of equity: &quot;If the legislature means to enact an injustice, however palpable, the court of Chancery is not the body with whom a correcting power is lodged. That it shall not interpose in any case which does not come within a general description and admit of redress by a general and practicable rule.&quot; The US Supreme Court, however, has concluded that courts have wide discretion to fashion relief in cases of equity. The first major statement of this power came in &quot;Willard v. Tayloe&quot;, 75 U.S. 557 (1869). The Court concluded that &quot;relief is not a matter of absolute right to either party; it is a matter resting in the discretion of the court, to be exercised upon a consideration of all the circumstances of each particular case.&quot; &quot;Willard v. Tayloe&quot; was for many years the leading case in contract law regarding intent and enforcement. as well as equity.

In the United States, the federal courts and most state courts have merged law and equity into courts of general jurisdiction, such as county courts. However, the substantive distinction between law and equity has retained its old vitality. This difference is not a mere technicality, because the successful handling of certain law cases is difficult or impossible unless a temporary restraining order (TRO) or preliminary injunction is issued at the outset, to restrain someone from fleeing the jurisdiction taking the only property available to satisfy a judgment, for instance. Furthermore, certain statutes like the Employee Retirement Income Security Act specifically authorize &quot;only&quot; equitable relief, which forces American courts to analyze in lengthy detail whether the relief demanded in particular cases brought under those statutes would have been available in equity.

Equity courts were widely distrusted in the northeastern United States following the American Revolution. A serious movement for merger of law and equity began in the states in the mid-19th century, when David Dudley Field II convinced New York State to adopt what became known as the Field Code of 1848. The federal courts did not abandon the old law/equity separation until the promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938.

Three states still have separate courts for law and equity: Delaware, whose Court of Chancery is where most cases involving Delaware corporations (which includes a disproportionate number of multi-state corporations) are decided; Mississippi; and Tennessee. However, merger in some states is less than complete; some other states (such as Illinois and New Jersey) have separate divisions for legal and equitable matters in a single court. Virginia had separate law and equity dockets (in the same court) until 2006. Besides corporate law, which developed out of the law of trusts, areas traditionally handled by chancery courts included wills and probate, adoptions and guardianships, and marriage and divorce. Bankruptcy was also historically considered an equitable matter; although bankruptcy in the United States is today a purely federal matter, reserved entirely to the United States Bankruptcy Courts by the enactment of the United States Bankruptcy Code in 1978, bankruptcy courts are still officially considered &quot;courts of equity&quot; and exercise equitable powers under Section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code.

After US courts merged law and equity, American law courts adopted many of the procedures of equity courts. The procedures in a court of equity were much more flexible than the courts at common law. In American practice, certain devices such as joinder, counterclaim, cross-claim and interpleader originated in the courts of equity.

<text>Rubiaceae () is a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the coffee, madder, or bedstraw family. It consists of terrestrial trees, shrubs, lianas, or herbs that are recognizable by simple, opposite leaves with interpetiolar stipules and sympetalous actinomorphic flowers. The family contains about 14,100 species in about 580 genera, which makes it the fourth-largest angiosperm family. Rubiaceae has a cosmopolitan distribution; however, the largest species diversity is concentrated in the tropics and subtropics. Economically important genera include &quot;Coffea&quot;, the source of coffee; &quot;Cinchona&quot;, the source of the antimalarial alkaloid quinine; ornamental cultivars (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Gardenia&quot;, &quot;Ixora&quot;, &quot;Pentas&quot;); and historically some dye plants (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Rubia&quot;).

==Description==
The Rubiaceae are morphologically easily recognizable as a coherent group by a combination of characters: opposite or whorled leaves that are simple and entire, interpetiolar stipules, tubular sympetalous actinomorphic corollas and an inferior ovary.

A wide variety of growth forms are present: shrubs are most common (e.g. &quot;Coffea&quot;, &quot;Psychotria&quot;), but members of the family can also be trees (e.g. &quot;Cinchona&quot;, &quot;Nauclea&quot;), lianas (e.g. &quot;Psychotria samoritourei&quot;), or herbs (e.g. &quot;Galium&quot;, &quot;Spermacoce&quot;). Some epiphytes are also present (e.g. &quot;Myrmecodia&quot;). The plants usually contain iridoids, various alkaloids, and raphide crystals are common. The leaves are simple, undivided, and entire; there is only one case of pinnately compound leaves (&quot;Pentagonia osapinnata&quot;). Leaf blades are usually elliptical, with a cuneate base and an acute tip. In three genera (&quot;Pavetta&quot;, &quot;Psychotria&quot;, &quot;Sericanthe&quot;), bacterial leaf nodules can be observed as dark spots or lines on the leaves. The phyllotaxis is usually decussate, rarely whorled (e.g. &quot;Fadogia&quot;), or rarely seemingly alternate resulting from the reduction of one leaf at each node (e.g. &quot;Sabicea sthenula&quot;). Characteristic for the Rubiaceae is the presence of stipules that are mostly fused to an interpetiolar structure on either side of the stem between the opposite leaves. Their inside surface often bears glands called &quot;colleters&quot;, which produce mucilaginous compounds protecting the young shoot. The &quot;whorled&quot; leaves of the herbaceous tribe Rubieae have classically been interpreted as true leaves plus interpetiolar leaf-like stipules. The inflorescence is a cyme, rarely of solitary flowers (e.g. &quot;Rothmannia&quot;), and is either terminal or axillary and paired at the nodes. The 4-5-merous (rarely pleiomerous; e.g. six in &quot;Richardia&quot;) flowers are usually bisexual and usually epigynous. The perianth is usually biseriate, although the calyx is absent in some taxa (e.g. &quot;Theligonum&quot;). The calyx mostly has the lobes fused at the base; unequal calyx lobes are not uncommon, and sometimes (e.g. &quot;Mussaenda&quot;) one lobe is enlarged and coloured (a so-called “semaphyl”). The corolla is sympetalous, mostly actinomorphic, usually tubular, mostly white or creamy but also yellow (e.g. &quot;Gardenia&quot; spp., &quot;Mycelia basiflora&quot;), and rarely blue (e.g. &quot;Faramea calyptrata&quot;) or red (e.g. &quot;Alberta magna&quot;, &quot;Ixora coccinea&quot;). The stamens are alternipetalous and epipetalous. Anthers are longitudinal in dehiscence, but are poricidal in some genera (e.g. &quot;Rustia&quot;, &quot;Tresanthera&quot;). The gynoecium is syncarpous with an inferior ovary (rarely secondarily superior, e.g. &quot;Gaertnera&quot;, &quot;Pagamea&quot;). Placentation is axial, rarely parietal (e.g. &quot;Gardenia&quot;); ovules are anatropous to hemitropous, unitegmic, with a funicular obturator, one to many per carpel. Nectaries are often present as a nectariferous disk atop the ovary. The fruit is a berry, capsule (e.g. &quot;Oldenlandia&quot;), drupe (e.g. &quot;Coffea&quot;, &quot;Psychotria&quot;), or schizocarp (e.g. &quot;Cremocarpon&quot;). Red fruits are fairly dominant (e.g. &quot;Coffea arabica&quot;); yellow (e.g. &quot;Rosenbergiodendron formosum&quot;), orange (e.g. &quot;Vangueria infausta&quot;), or blackish fruits (e.g. &quot;Pavetta gardeniifolia&quot;) are equally common; blue fruits are rather exceptional save in the Psychotrieae and associated tribes. Most fruits are about 1 cm in diameter; very small fruits are relatively rare and occur in herbaceous tribes; very large fruits are rare and confined to the Gardenieae. The seeds are endospermous.

==Distribution and habitat==
Rubiaceae have a cosmopolitan distribution and are found in nearly every region of the world, except for extreme environments such as the polar regions and deserts. The distribution pattern of the family is very similar to the global distribution of plant diversity overall. However, the largest diversity is distinctly concentrated in the humid tropics and subtropics. An exception is the tribe Rubieae, which is cosmopolitan but centered in temperate regions. Only a few genera are pantropical (e.g. &quot;Ixora&quot;, &quot;Psychotria&quot;), many are paleotropical, while Afro-American distributions are rare (e.g. &quot;Sabicea&quot;). Endemic rubiaceous genera are found in most tropical and subtropical floristic regions of the world. The highest number of species is found in Colombia, Venezuela, and New Guinea. When adjusted for area, Venezuela is the most diverse, followed by Colombia and Cuba.

The Rubiaceae consist of terrestrial and predominantly woody plants. Woody rubiaceous shrubs constitute an important part of the understorey of low- and mid-altitude rainforests. Rubiaceae are tolerant of a broad array of environmental conditions (soil types, altitudes, community structures, etc.) and do not specialize in one specific habitat type (although genera within the family often specialize).

==Ecology==

===Flower biology===
Most members of the Rubiaceae are zoophilous, pollinated mainly by insects. Entomophilous species produce nectar from an epigynous disk at the base of the corolla tube to attract insects. Ornithophily is rare and is found in red-flowered species of &quot;Alberta&quot;, &quot;Bouvardia&quot;, and &quot;Burchellia&quot;. Anemophilous species are found in the tribes Anthospermeae and Theligoneae and are characterized by hermaphroditic or unisexual flowers that exhibit a set of specialized features, such as striking sexual dimorphism, increased receptive surface of the stigmas and pendulous anthers.

Although most Rubiaceae species are hermaphroditic, outbreeding is promoted through sequential hermaphroditism and spatial isolation of the reproductive organs. More complex reproductive strategies include secondary pollen presentation, heterostyly, and unisexual flowers.

Secondary pollen presentation (also known as stylar pollen presentation or ixoroid pollen mechanism) is especially known from the Gardenieae and related tribes. The flowers are proterandrous and the pollen is shed early onto the outside of the stigmas or the upper part of the style, which serve as a pollen receptacle. Increased surface area and irregularity of the pollen receptacle, caused by swellings, hairs, grooves or ridges often ensure a more efficient pollen deposition. After elongation of the style, animals transport the pollen to flowers in the female or receptive stage with exposed stigmatic surfaces. A pollen catapult mechanism is present in the genera &quot;Molopanthera&quot; and &quot;Posoqueria&quot; (tribe Posoquerieae) that projects a spherical pollen mass onto visiting hawk moths.

Heterostyly is another mechanism to avoid inbreeding and is widely present in the family Rubiaceae. The tribes containing the largest number of heterostylous species are Spermacoceae and Psychotrieae. Heterostyly is absent in groups that have secondary pollen presentation (e.g. Vanguerieae).

Unisexual flowers also occur in Rubiaceae and most taxa that have this characteristic are dioecious. The two flower morphs are however difficult to observe as they are rather morphologically similar; male flowers have a rudimentary pistil with the ovaries empty and female flowers sterile or rudimentary stamens with empty anthers. Flowers that are morphologically hermaphrodite, but functionally dioecious occur in &quot;Pyrostria&quot;.

=== Fruit biology ===
The dispersal units in Rubiaceae can be entire fruits, syncarps, mericarps, pyrenes or seeds. Fleshy fruit taxa are probably all (endo)zoochorous (e.g. tribes Pavetteae, Psychotrieae), while the dispersal of dry fruits is often unspecialized (e.g. tribes Knoxieae, Spermacoceae). When seeds function as diaspores, the dispersal is either anemochorous or hydrochorous. The three types of wind-dispersed diaspores in Rubiaceae are dust seeds (rare, e.g. &quot;Lerchea&quot;), plumed seeds (e.g. &quot;Hillia&quot;), and winged seeds (e.g. &quot;Coutarea&quot;). Long-distance dispersal by ocean currents is very rare (e.g. the seashore tree &quot;Guettarda speciosa&quot;). Other dispersal mechanisms are absent or at least very rare. Some Spermacoceae having seeds with elaiosomes are probably myrmecochorous (e.g. &quot;Spermacoce hepperiana&quot;). Epizoochorous taxa are limited to herbaceous Rubiaceae (e.g. &quot;Galium aparine&quot; fruits are densely covered with hooked bristly hairs).

=== Associations with other organisms ===
The genera &quot;Anthorrhiza&quot;, &quot;Hydnophytum&quot;, &quot;Myrmecodia&quot;, &quot;Myrmephytum&quot;, and &quot;Squamellaria&quot; are succulent epiphytes that have evolved a mutualistic relationship with ants. Their hypocotyl grows out into an ant-inhabited tuber. Some shrubs or trees have ant holes in their stems (e.g. &quot;Globulostylis&quot;). Some Rubiaceae species have domatia that are inhabited by mites (viz. acarodomatia; e.g. &quot;Plectroniella armata&quot;).

An intimate association between bacteria and plants is found in three rubiaceous genera (viz. &quot;Pavetta&quot;, &quot;Psychotria&quot;, and &quot;Sericanthe&quot;). The presence of endophytic bacteria is visible by eye because of the formation of dark spots or nodules in the leaf blades. The endophytes have been identified as &quot;Burkholderia&quot; bacteria. A second type of bacterial leaf symbiosis is found in the genera &quot;Fadogia&quot;, &quot;Fadogiella&quot;, &quot;Globulostylis&quot;, &quot;Rytigynia&quot;, and &quot;Vangueria&quot; (all belonging to the tribe Vanguerieae), and in some species of &quot;Empogona&quot; and &quot;Tricalysia&quot; (both belonging to the tribe Coffeeae), where &quot;Burkholderia&quot; bacteria are found freely distributed among the mesophyll cells and no leaf nodules are formed. The hypothesis regarding the function of the symbiosis is that the endophytes provide chemical protection against herbivory by producing certain toxic secondary metabolites.

==Systematics==
The family Rubiaceae is named after &quot;Rubia&quot;, a name used by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia for madder (&quot;Rubia tinctorum&quot;). The roots of this plant have been used since ancient times to extract alizarin and purpurin, two red dyes used for coloring clothes. The name &quot;rubia&quot; is therefore derived from the Latin word &quot;ruber&quot;, meaning &quot;red&quot;. The well-known genus &quot;Rubus&quot; (blackberries and raspberries) is unrelated and belongs to Rosaceae, the rose family.

===Taxonomy===
The name Rubiaceae (nomen conservandum) was published in 1789 by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, but the name was already mentioned in 1782.

Several historically accepted families are included in Rubiaceae: Aparinaceae, Asperulaceae, Catesbaeaceae, Cephalanthaceae, Cinchonaceae, Coffeaceae, Coutariaceae, Dialypetalanthaceae, Galiaceae, Gardeniaceae, Guettardaceae, Hameliaceae, Hedyotidaceae, Henriqueziaceae, Houstoniaceae, Hydrophylacaceae, Lippayaceae, Lygodisodeaceae, Naucleaceae, Nonateliaceae, Operculariaceae, Pagamaeaceae, Psychotriaceae, Randiaceae, Sabiceaceae, Spermacoceaceae, Theligonaceae.

====Subfamilies and tribes====
The classical classification system of Rubiaceae distinguished only two subfamilies: Cinchonoideae, characterized by more than one ovule in each locule, and Coffeoideae, having one ovule in each locule. This distinction, however, was criticized because of the distant position of two obviously related tribes, viz. Gardenieae with many ovules in Cinchonoideae and Ixoreae with one ovule in Coffeoideae, and because in species of &quot;Tarenna&quot; the number of ovules varies from one to several in each locule. During the 20th century, other morphological characters were used to delineate subfamilies, e.g. stylar pollen presentation, raphides, endosperm, heterostyly, etc. On this basis, three or eight subfamilies were recognised. The last subfamilial classification solely based on morphological characters divided Rubiaceae into four subfamilies: Cinchonoideae, Ixoroideae, Antirheoideae, and Rubioideae. In general, problems of subfamilies delimitation in Rubiaceae based on morphological characters are linked with the extreme naturalness of the family, hence a relatively low divergence of its members.

The introduction of molecular phylogenetics in Rubiaceae research has corroborated or rejected several of the conclusions made in the pre-molecular era. There was support for the subfamilies Cinchonoideae, Ixoroideae, and Rubioideae, although differently circumscribed, and Antirheoideae was shown to be polyphyletic. For a long time, the classification with three subfamilies (Cinchonoideae, Ixoroideae, and Rubioideae) was followed. However, an alternative opinion existed with only two subfamilies: an expanded Cinchonoideae (that includes Ixoroideae, Coptosapelteae, and Luculieae) and Rubioideae. Finally, more and more evidence pointed towards a two-family classification. The adoption of the Melbourne Code for botanical nomenclature had an unexpected impact on many names that have been long in use and are well-established in literature. According to the Melbourne Code, the subfamilial name Ixoroideae had to be replaced by Dialypetalanthoideae. This means that the two subfamilies in Rubiaceae now are: Dialypetalanthoideae and Rubioideae. The monogeneric tribes Coptosapelteae, Acranthereae, and Luculieae are not placed within a subfamily and are sister to the rest of Rubiaceae. The following overview shows the latest classification of the family, with two subfamilies and 71 tribes. The approximate number of species and genera are indicated between brackets (species/genera).

====Genera====

The family Rubiaceae contains about 14,100 species in 580 genera. This makes it the fourth-largest family of flowering plants by number of species and fifth-largest by number of genera. Although taxonomic adjustments are still being made, the total number of accepted genera remains stable. In total, around 1338 genus names have been published, indicating that more than half of the published names are synonyms. &quot;Psychotria&quot;, with around 1630 species, is the largest genus within the family and the third-largest genus of the angiosperms, after the legume &quot;Astragalus&quot; and the orchid &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot;. However, the delimitation of &quot;Psychotria&quot; remains problematic and its adjustment might reduce the number of species. In total, 30 genera have more than 100 species. However, 197 genera are monotypic, which account for a third of all genera, but only for 1.4% of all species.

===Phylogeny===
Molecular studies have demonstrated the phylogenetic placement of Rubiaceae within the order Gentianales and the monophyly of the family is confirmed. The relationships of the two subfamilies of Rubiaceae together with the tribes Acranthereae, Coptosapelteae, and Luculieae are shown in the phylogenetic tree below. The placement of these three tribes relative to the two subfamilies has not been fully resolved.

===Evolution===
The fossil history of the Rubiaceae goes back at least as far as the Eocene. The geographic distribution of these fossils, coupled with the fact that they represent all three subfamilies, is indicative of an earlier origin for the family, probably in the Late Cretaceous or Paleocene. Although fossils dating back to the Cretaceous and Palaeocene have been referred to the family by various authors, none of these fossils has been confirmed as belonging to the Rubiaceae.

The oldest confirmed fossils, which are fruits that strongly resemble those of the genus &quot;Emmenopterys&quot;, were found in the Washington and are 48–49 million years old. A fossil infructescence and fruit found in 44 million-year-old strata in Oregon was assigned to &quot;Emmenopterys dilcheri&quot;, an extinct species. The next-oldest fossils date to the Late Eocene and include &quot;Canthium&quot; from Australia, &quot;Faramea&quot; from Panama, &quot;Guettarda&quot; from New Caledonia, and &quot;Paleorubiaceophyllum&quot;, an extinct genus from the southeastern United States.

Fossil Rubiaceae are known from three regions in the Eocene (North America north of Mexico, Mexico-Central America-Caribbean, and Southeast Pacific-Asia). In the Oligocene, they are found in these three regions plus Africa. In the Miocene, they are found in these four regions plus South America and Europe.

==Uses==

===Food===
No staple foods are found in the Rubiaceae, but some species are consumed locally and fruits may be used as famine food. Examples are African medlar fruits (e.g. &quot;V. infausta&quot;, &quot;V. madagascariensis&quot;), African peach (&quot;Nauclea latifolia&quot;), and noni (&quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot;).

===Beverage===
The most economically important member of the family is the genus &quot;Coffea&quot; used in the production of coffee. &quot;Coffea&quot; includes 124 species, but only three species are cultivated for coffee production: &quot;C. arabica&quot;, &quot;C. canephora&quot;, and &quot;C. liberica&quot;.

===Medicinal===
The bark of trees in the genus &quot;Cinchona&quot; is the source of a variety of alkaloids, the most familiar of which is quinine, one of the first agents effective in treating malaria. Woodruff (&quot;Galium odoratum&quot;) is a small herbaceous perennial that contains coumarin, a natural precursor of warfarin, and the South American plant &quot;Carapichea ipecacuanha&quot; is the source of the emetic ipecac. &quot;Psychotria viridis&quot; is frequently used as a source of dimethyltryptamine in the preparation of ayahuasca, a psychoactive decoction. The bark of the species &quot;Breonadia salicina&quot; have been used in traditional African medicine for many years. The leaves of the Kratom plant (&quot;Mitragyna speciosa&quot;) contain a variety of alkaloids, including several psychoactive alkaloids and is traditionally prepared and consumed in Southeast Asia, where it has been known to exhibit both painkilling and stimulant qualities, behaving as a μ-opioid receptor agonist, and often being used in traditional Thai medicine in a similar way to and often as a replacement for opioid painkillers like morphine.

===Ornamentals===
Originally from China, the common gardenia (&quot;Gardenia jasminoides&quot;) is a widely grown garden plant and flower in frost-free climates worldwide. Several other species from the genus are also seen in horticulture. The genus &quot;Ixora&quot; contains plants cultivated in warmer-climate gardens; the most commonly grown species, &quot;Ixora coccinea&quot;, is frequently used for pretty red-flowering hedges. &quot;Mussaenda&quot; cultivars with enlarged, colored calyx lobes are shrubs with the aspect of &quot;Hydrangea&quot;; they are mainly cultivated in tropical Asia. The New Zealand native &quot;Coprosma repens&quot; is a commonly used plant for hedges. The South African &quot;Rothmannia globosa&quot; is seen as a specimen tree in horticulture. &quot;Nertera granadensis&quot; is a well-known house plant cultivated for its conspicuous orange berries. Other ornamental plants include &quot;Mitchella&quot;, &quot;Morinda&quot;, &quot;Pentas&quot;, and &quot;Rubia&quot;.

===Dyes===
Rose madder, the crushed root of &quot;Rubia tinctorum&quot;, yields a red dye, and the tropical &quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot; yields a yellow dye.

<text>Uncaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It has about 40 species. Their distribution is pantropical, with most species native to tropical Asia, three from Africa and the Mediterranean and two from the neotropics. They are known colloquially as gambier, cat&#x27;s claw or uña de gato. The latter two names are shared with several other plants. The type species for the genus is &quot;Uncaria guianensis&quot;.

Indonesian Gambier (&quot;U. gambir&quot;) is a large tropical vine with leaves typical of the genus, being opposite and about long. The South American &quot;U. tomentosa&quot; is called Uña de Gato. &quot;Uncaria sinensis&quot; is common in China.

&quot;Uncaria&quot; was named in 1789 by Johann von Schreber in his &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot; edition 8[a] (not to be confused with books of the same title by Linnaeus, Jussieu, and others). The genus name is derived from the Latin word &quot;uncus&quot;, meaning &quot;a hook&quot;. It refers to the hooks, formed from reduced branches, that &quot;Uncaria&quot; vines use to cling to other vegetation.

&quot;Uncaria&quot; is a member of the tribe Naucleeae, but its position within that tribe remains unresolved.

==Description==
Woody lianas; climbing by hooks formed from reduced, modified branches. Stipules entire or bifid. Inflorescences are compact heads at the ends of horizontal, very reduced branches. Corolla lobes without appendages. Seeds with a long wing at each end, the lower wing deeply bifid.

*&quot;Uncaria sessilifructus&quot; 
*&quot;Uncaria sinensis&quot; 
*&quot;Uncaria sterrophylla&quot; 
*&quot;Uncaria talbotii&quot; 
*&quot;Uncaria tomentosa&quot; 
*&quot;Uncaria velutina&quot; 
==Uses==
Diplomat Edmund Roberts noted that, upon his visit to China in the 1830s, Chinese were using &quot;U. gambir&quot; for tanning, and noted that the &quot;U. gambir&quot; made &quot;leather porous and rotten.&quot; He also noted that Chinese would chew it with areca nut. The plant extract contains some 150 identified phytochemicals, including catechins, proanthocyanins, and chalcone-flavan-3-ol dimers, called gambiriins. Cat&#x27;s claw (&quot;U. tomentosa&quot;) and the Chinese &quot;Uncaria&quot; species are used in traditional medicine, although there is no high-quality clinical evidence they have any medicinal properties.

==Adverse effects==
Although cat&#x27;s claw appears to be safe for human use below 350 milligrams per day over 6 weeks, its adverse effects may include nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach, and an increased risk of bleeding if used with an anticoagulant drug.

<text>Cubomania is a Surrealist technique of making collages by cutting an image into squares and reassembling without regard for the original image at random to create something new. 

The technique was invented by the Romanian surrealist Gherasim Luca. Luca introduced cubomania at two exhibitions in Bucharest, in 1945 and 1946, and in small publications. Luca positioned cubomania as a mix of Karl Marx&#x27;s and André Breton&#x27;s ideas. It was a critique of the alleged objectivity of social conditions and rejected the tyranny over liberty. 

It has been described as a &quot;statistical method&quot;.

Penelope Rosemont and Joseph Jablonski have suggested that cubomania can &quot;subvert the enslaving &#x27;message&#x27; of advertising and to free images from repressive contexts.&quot;
