<text>The Boeing B-29 Superfortress was an American four-engined propeller-driven heavy bomber, designed by Boeing and flown primarily by the United States during World War II and the Korean War. Named in allusion to its predecessor, the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, the Superfortress was designed for high-altitude strategic bombing, but also excelled in low-altitude night incendiary bombing, and in dropping naval mines to blockade Japan. B-29s dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only aircraft ever to drop nuclear weapons in combat.

One of the largest aircraft of World War II, the B-29 was designed with state-of-the-art technology, which included a pressurized cabin, dual-wheeled tricycle landing gear, and an analog computer-controlled fire-control system that allowed one gunner and a fire-control officer to direct four remote machine gun turrets. The $3 billion cost of design and production (equivalent to $ billion in ), far exceeding the $1.9 billion cost of the Manhattan Project, made the B-29 program the most expensive of the war. The B-29 remained in service in various roles throughout the 1950s, being retired in the early 1960s after 3,970 had been built. A few were also used as flying television transmitters by the Stratovision company. The Royal Air Force flew the B-29 with the service name &quot;Washington&quot; from 1950 to 1954 when the jet-powered Canberra entered service.

The B-29 was the progenitor of a series of Boeing-built bombers, transports, tankers, reconnaissance aircraft, and trainers. For example, the re-engined B-50 Superfortress &quot;Lucky Lady II&quot; became the first aircraft to fly around the world non-stop, during a 94-hour flight in 1949. The Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter airlifter, which was first flown in 1944, was followed in 1947 by its commercial airliner variant, the Boeing Model 377 Stratocruiser. In 1948, Boeing introduced the KB-29 tanker, followed in 1950 by the Model 377-derivative KC-97. A line of outsized-cargo variants of the Stratocruiser is the GuppyMini GuppySuper Guppy, which remain in service with NASA and other operators. The Soviet Union produced 847 Tupolev Tu-4s, an unlicensed reverse-engineered copy of the B-29. Twenty-two B-29s have survived to preservation; while the majority are on static display at museums, 2 airframes, &quot;FIFI&quot; and &quot;Doc&quot;, still fly.

==Design and development==

Boeing began work on long-range bombers in 1938. Boeing&#x27;s design study for the Model 334 was a pressurized derivative of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress with nosewheel undercarriage. Although the Air Corps lacked funds to pursue the design, Boeing continued development with its own funds as a private venture. In December 1939, the Air Corps issued a formal specification for a so-called &quot;superbomber&quot; that could deliver of bombs to a target away, and at a speed of . Boeing&#x27;s previous private venture studies formed the starting point for its response to the Air Corps formal specification.

On 29 January 1940, the United States Army Air Corps issued a request to five major aircraft manufacturers to submit designs for a four-engine bomber with a range of . Boeing submitted its Model 345 on 11 May 1940, in competition with designs from Consolidated Aircraft (the Model 33, which later became the B-32), Lockheed (the Lockheed XB-30), and Douglas (the Douglas XB-31). 

Douglas and Lockheed soon abandoned work on their projects, but Boeing received an order for two flying prototypes, which were given the designation XB-29, and an airframe for static testing on 24 August 1940, with the order being revised to add a third flying aircraft on 14 December. Consolidated continued to work on its Model 33, as it was seen by the Air Corps as a backup if there were problems with Boeing&#x27;s design. These designs were evaluated, and on 6 September orders were placed for two experimental models each from Boeing and Consolidated Aircraft, which became the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and the Consolidated B-32 Dominator. These were known as very long range (VLR) bombers; the name &quot;Superfortress&quot; was not assigned until March 1944. On 17 May 1941, Boeing received an initial production order for 14 service test aircraft and 250 production bombers; this being increased to 500 aircraft in January 1942. 

Manufacturing the B-29 was a complex task that involved four main-assembly factories. There were two Boeing operated plants at Renton, Washington (Boeing Renton Factory), and one in Wichita, Kansas (now Spirit AeroSystems), a Bell plant at Marietta, Georgia, near Atlanta (&quot;Bell-Atlanta&quot;), and a Martin plant at Bellevue, Nebraska (&quot;Martin-Omaha&quot; – Offutt Field). Thousands of subcontractors were also involved in the project. The first prototype made its maiden flight from Boeing Field, Seattle, on 21 September 1942. The combined effects of the aircraft&#x27;s highly advanced design, challenging requirements, immense pressure for production, and hurried development caused setbacks. Unlike the unarmed first prototype, the second was fitted with a Sperry defensive armament system using remote-controlled gun turrets sighted by periscopes and first flew on 30 December 1942, although the flight was terminated due to a serious engine fire.

On 18 February 1943, the second prototype, flying out of Boeing Field in Seattle, experienced an engine fire and crashed. The crash killed Boeing test pilot Edmund T. Allen and his 10-man crew, 20 workers at the Frye Meat Packing Plant and a Seattle firefighter. Changes to the production craft came so often and so fast that, in early 1944, B-29s flew from the production lines directly to modification depots for extensive rebuilds to incorporate the latest changes. AAF-contracted modification centers and its own air depot system struggled to handle the scope of the requirements. Some facilities lacked hangars capable of housing the giant B-29, requiring outdoor work in freezing weather, further delaying necessary modification. By the end of 1943, although almost 100 aircraft had been delivered, only 15 were airworthy. This prompted an intervention by General Hap Arnold to resolve the problem, with production personnel being sent from the factories to the modification centers to speed availability of sufficient aircraft to equip the first bomb groups in what became known as the &quot;Battle of Kansas&quot;. This resulted in 150 aircraft being modified in the five weeks, between 10 March and 15 April 1944.

The most common cause of maintenance headaches and catastrophic failures was the engines. Although the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines later became a trustworthy workhorse in large piston-engined aircraft, early models were beset with dangerous reliability problems. This problem was not fully cured until the aircraft was fitted with the more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 &quot;Wasp Major&quot; in the B-29D/B-50 program, which arrived too late for World War II. Interim measures included cuffs placed on propeller blades to divert a greater flow of cooling air into the intakes, which had baffles installed to direct a stream of air onto the exhaust valves. Oil flow to the valves was also increased, asbestos baffles were installed around rubber push rod fittings to prevent oil loss, thorough pre-flight inspections were made to detect unseated valves, and mechanics frequently replaced the uppermost five cylinders (every 25 hours of engine time) and the entire engines (every 75 hours).

Pilots, including the present-day pilots of the Commemorative Air Force&#x27;s &quot;Fifi&quot;, one of the last two remaining flying B-29s, describe flight after takeoff as being an urgent struggle for airspeed (generally, flight after takeoff should consist of striving for altitude). Radial engines need airflow to keep them cool, and failure to get up to speed as soon as possible could result in an engine failure and risk of fire. One useful technique was to check the magnetos while already on takeoff roll rather than during a conventional static engine-runup before takeoff.
The $3 billion cost of design and production (equivalent to $ billion in 2022), far exceeding the $1.9 billion cost of the Manhattan Project, made the B-29 program the most expensive of the war. Unit cost was US$639,188 (prototype cost $3,392,396.60)
==Features==


===Defensive gun turret emplacements===
In wartime, the B-29 was capable of flight at altitudes up to , at speeds of up to (true airspeed). This was its best defense because Japanese fighters could barely reach that altitude, and few could catch the B-29 even if they did attain that altitude.

The General Electric Central Fire Control system on the B-29 directed four remotely controlled turrets armed with two .50 Browning M2 machine guns each. All weapons were aimed optically, with targeting computed by analog electrical instrumentation. There were five interconnected sighting stations located in the nose and tail positions and three Plexiglas blisters in the central fuselage. Five General Electric analog computers (one dedicated to each sight) increased the weapons&#x27; accuracy by compensating for factors such as airspeed, lead, gravity, temperature and humidity. The computers also allowed a single gunner to operate two or more turrets (including tail guns) simultaneously. The gunner in the upper position acted as fire control officer, managing the distribution of turrets among the other gunners during combat. The tail position initially had two .50 Browning machine guns and a single M2 20 mm cannon. Later aircraft had the 20 mm cannon removed, sometimes replaced by a third machine gun.

In early 1945, Major General Curtis Lemay, commander of XXI Bomber Command—the Marianas-based B-29-equipped bombing force—ordered most of the defensive armament and remote-controlled sighting equipment removed from the B-29s under his command. The affected aircraft had the same reduced defensive firepower as the nuclear weapons-delivery intended &quot;Silverplate&quot; B-29 airframes and could carry greater fuel and bomb loads as a result of the change. The lighter defensive armament was made possible by a change in mission from high-altitude, daylight bombing with high explosive bombs to low-altitude night raids using incendiary bombs. As a consequence of that requirement, Bell Atlanta (BA) produced a series of 311 B-29Bs that had turrets and sighting equipment omitted, except for the tail position, which was fitted with AN/APG-15 fire-control radar. That version could also have an improved APQ-7 &quot;Eagle&quot; bombing-through-overcast radar fitted in an airfoil-shaped radome under the fuselage. Most of those aircraft were assigned to the 315th Bomb Wing, Northwest Field, Guam.

===Pressurization===

The crew would enjoy, for the first time in a bomber, full-pressurization comfort. This first-ever cabin pressure system for an Allied production bomber was developed for the B-29 by Garrett AiResearch. Both the forward and rear crew compartments were to be pressurized, but the designers had to decide whether to have bomb bays that were not pressurized or a fully pressurized fuselage that would have to be de-pressurized prior to opening the bomb bay doors. The solution was to have bomb bays that were not pressurized and a long tunnel joining the forward and rear crew compartments. Crews could use the tunnel if necessary to crawl from one pressurized compartment to the other.

==Operational history==

===World War II===


In September 1941, the United States Army Air Forces&#x27; plans for war against Germany and Japan proposed basing the B-29 in Egypt for operations against Germany, as British airbases were likely to be overcrowded. Air Force planning throughout 1942 and early 1943 continued to have the B-29 deployed initially against Germany, transferring to the Pacific only after the end of the war in Europe. By the end of 1943, plans had changed, partly due to production delays, and the B-29 was dedicated to the Pacific Theater. A new plan implemented at the direction of President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a promise to China, called Operation Matterhorn, deployed the B-29 units to attack Japan from four forward bases in southern China, with five main bases in India, and to attack other targets in the region from China and India as needed. The Chengdu region was eventually chosen over the Guilin region to avoid having to raise, equip, and train 50 Chinese divisions to protect the advanced bases from Japanese ground attack. The XX Bomber Command, initially intended to be two combat wings of four groups each, was reduced to a single wing of four groups because of the lack of availability of aircraft, automatically limiting the effectiveness of any attacks from China.

This was an extremely costly scheme, as there was no overland connection available between India and China, and all supplies had to be flown over the Himalayas, either by transport aircraft or by B-29s themselves, with some aircraft being stripped of armor and guns and used to deliver fuel. B-29s started to arrive in India in early April 1944. The first B-29 flight to airfields in China (over the Himalayas, or &quot;The Hump&quot;) took place on 24 April 1944. The first B-29 combat mission was flown on 5 June 1944, with 77 out of 98 B-29s launched from India bombing the railroad shops in Bangkok and elsewhere in Thailand. Five B-29s were lost during the mission, none to hostile fire.

====Forward base in China====
On 5 June 1944, B-29s raided Bangkok, in what is reported as a test before being deployed against the Japanese home islands. Sources do not report from where they launched and vary as to the numbers involved—77, 98, and 114 being claimed. Targets were Bangkok&#x27;s Memorial Bridge and a major power plant. Bombs fell over two kilometers away, damaged no civilian structures, but destroyed some tram lines, and destroyed both a Japanese military hospital and the Japanese secret police headquarters. On 15 June 1944, 68 B-29s took off from bases around Chengdu, 47 B-29s bombed the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. This was the first attack on Japanese islands since the Doolittle raid in April 1942. The first B-29 combat losses occurred during this raid, with one B-29 destroyed on the ground by Japanese fighters after an emergency landing in China, one lost to anti-aircraft fire over Yawata, and another, the &quot;Stockett&#x27;s Rocket&quot; (after Capt. Marvin M. Stockett, Aircraft Commander) B-29-1-BW 42-6261, disappeared after takeoff from Chakulia, India, over the Himalayas (12 KIA, 11 crew and one passenger). This raid, which did little damage to the target, with only one bomb striking the target factory complex, nearly exhausted fuel stocks at the Chengdu B-29 bases, resulting in a slow-down of operations until the fuel stockpiles could be replenished. Starting in July, the raids against Japan from Chinese airfields continued at relatively low intensity. Japan was bombed on:

* 7 July 1944 (14 B-29s)
* 29 July (70+)
* 10 August (24)
* 20 August (61)
* 8 September (90)
* 26 September (83)
* 25 October (59)
* 12 November (29)
* 21 November (61)
* 19 December (36)
* 6 January 1945 (49)
B-29s were withdrawn from airfields in China by the end of January 1945. Throughout the prior period, B-29 raids were also launched from China and India against many other targets throughout Southeast Asia, including a series of raids on Singapore and Thailand. On 2 November 1944, 55 B-29s raided Bangkok&#x27;s Bang Sue marshaling yards in the largest raid of the war. Seven RTAF Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Hayabusa&quot;s from Foong Bin (Air Group) 16 and 14 IJAAF Ki-43s attempted intercept. RTAF Flt Lt Therdsak Worrasap attacked a B-29, damaging it, but was shot down by return fire. One B-29 was lost, possibly the one damaged by Flt Lt Therdsak. On 14 April 1945, a second B-29 raid on Bangkok destroyed two key power plants and was the last major attack conducted against Thai targets. The B-29 effort was gradually shifted to the new bases in the Mariana Islands in the Central Pacific, with the last B-29 combat mission from India flown on 29 March 1945.

====New Mariana Islands air bases====
In addition to the logistical problems associated with operations from China, the B-29 could reach only a limited part of Japan while flying from Chinese bases. The solution to this problem was to capture the Mariana Islands, which would bring targets such as Tokyo, about north of the Marianas within range of B-29 attacks. The Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed in December 1943 to seize the Marianas.

US forces invaded Saipan on 15 June 1944. Despite a Japanese naval counterattack which led to the Battle of the Philippine Sea and heavy fighting on land, Saipan was secured by 9 July. Operations followed against Guam and Tinian, with all three islands secured by August.

Naval construction battalions (Seabees) began at once to construct air bases suitable for the B-29, commencing even before the end of ground fighting. In all, five major airfields were built: two on the flat island of Tinian, one on Saipan, and two on Guam. Each was large enough to eventually accommodate a bomb wing consisting of four bomb groups, giving a total of 180 B-29s per airfield. These bases could be supplied by ship and, unlike the bases in China, were not vulnerable to attack by Japanese ground forces.

The bases became the launch sites for the large B-29 raids against Japan in the final year of the war. The first B-29 arrived on Saipan on 12 October 1944, and the first combat mission was launched from there on 28 October 1944, with 14 B-29s attacking the Truk atoll. The 73rd Bomb Wing launched the first mission against Japan from bases in the Marianas, on 24 November 1944, sending 111 B-29s to attack Tokyo. For this first attack on the Japanese capital since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942, 73rd Bomb Wing wing commander Brigadier General Emmett O&#x27;Donnell Jr. acted as mission command pilot in B-29 &quot;Dauntless Dotty&quot;.

The campaign of incendiary raids started with the bombardment of Kobe on 4 February 1945, then peaked early with the most destructive bombing raid in history (even when the later &quot;Silverplate&quot;-flown nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are considered) on the night of 9–10 March 1945 on Tokyo. From then on, the raids intensified, being launched regularly until the end of the war. The attacks succeeded in devastating most large Japanese cities (with the exception of Kyoto and four that were reserved for nuclear attacks), and gravely damaged Japan&#x27;s war industries. Although less publicly appreciated, the mining of Japanese ports and shipping routes (Operation Starvation) carried out by B-29s from April 1945 reduced Japan&#x27;s ability to support its population and move its troops.

====Nuclear weapons====
The most famous B-29s were the Silverplate series, being extensively modified to carry nuclear weapons. Early consideration was given to using the British Lancaster as a nuclear bomber, as this would require less modification. However, the superior range and high-altitude performance of the B-29 made it a much better choice, and after the B-29 began to be modified in November 1943 for carrying the atomic bomb, the suggestion for using the Lancaster never came up again.

The most significant modification was the enlargement of the bomb bay enabling each aircraft to carry either the Thinman or Fatman weapons. These Silverplate bombers differed from other B-29s then in service by having fuel injection and reversible props. Also, to make a lighter aircraft, the Silverplate B-29s were stripped of all guns, except for those on the tail. Pilot Charles Sweeney credits the reversible props for saving &quot;Bockscar&quot; after making an emergency landing on Okinawa following the Nagasaki bombing.

&quot;Enola Gay&quot;, flown by Colonel Paul Tibbets, dropped the first bomb, called Little Boy, on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. &quot;Enola Gay&quot; is fully restored and on display at the Smithsonian&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, outside Dulles Airport near Washington, D.C. &quot;Bockscar&quot;, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney, dropped the second bomb, called Fat Man, on Nagasaki three days later. &quot;Bockscar&quot; is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

Following the surrender of Japan, called V-J Day, B-29s were used for other purposes. A number supplied POWs with food and other necessities by dropping barrels of rations on Japanese POW camps. In September 1945, a long-distance flight was undertaken for public relations purposes: Generals Barney M. Giles, Curtis LeMay, and Emmett O&#x27;Donnell Jr. piloted three specially modified B-29s from Chitose Air Base in Hokkaidō to Chicago Municipal Airport, continuing to Washington, D.C., the farthest nonstop distance () to that date flown by U.S. Army Air Forces aircraft and the first-ever nonstop flight from Japan to Chicago. Two months later, Colonel Clarence S. Irvine commanded another modified B-29, &quot;Pacusan Dreamboat&quot;, in a world-record-breaking long-distance flight from Guam to Washington, D.C., traveling in 35 hours, with a gross takeoff weight of . Almost a year later, in October 1946, the same B-29 flew nonstop from Oahu, Hawaii, to Cairo, Egypt, in less than 40 hours, demonstrating the possibility of routing airlines over the polar ice cap.

====B-29s in Europe and Australia====
Although considered for other theaters, and briefly evaluated in the UK, the B-29 was exclusively used in World War II in the Pacific Theatre. The use of YB-29-BW &quot;41-36393&quot;, the so-named &quot;Hobo Queen&quot;, one of the service test aircraft flown around several British airfields in early 1944, was part of a &quot;disinformation&quot; program from its mention in an American-published &quot;Sternenbanner&quot; German-language propaganda leaflet from Leap Year Day in 1944, meant to be circulated within the Reich, with the intent to deceive the Germans into believing that the B-29 would be deployed to Europe.

American post-war military assistance programs loaned the RAF 87 Superfortresses, to equip eight RAF Bomber Command squadrons. The aircraft was known as the Washington B.1 in RAF service and served from March 1950 until the last bombers were returned in March 1954. Deployment was restricted to long-range training for strategic attacks against the Soviet Union, which was beyond the range of the RAF&#x27;s Avro Lincolns. The phase-out was occasioned by deliveries of the English Electric Canberra bombers.

Three Washingtons modified for ELINT duties and a standard bomber version used for support by No. 192 Squadron RAF were decommissioned in 1958, being replaced by de Havilland Comet aircraft.

Two British Washington B.1 aircraft were transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1952. They were attached to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit and used in trials conducted on behalf of the British Ministry of Supply. Both aircraft were placed in storage in 1956 and were sold for scrap in 1957.

===Soviet Tupolev Tu-4===
At the end of WWII, Soviet development of modern four-engine heavy bombers lagged behind the West. The Petlyakov Pe-8—the sole heavy bomber operated by the Soviet Air Forces—first flew in 1936. Intended to replace the obsolete Tupolev TB-3, only 93 Pe-8s were built by the end of WWII. During 1944 and 1945, four B-29s made emergency landings in Soviet territory after bombing raids on Japanese Manchuria and Japan. In accordance with Soviet neutrality in the Pacific War, the bombers were interned by the Soviets despite American requests for their return. Rather than return the aircraft, the Soviets reverse engineered the American B-29s and used them as a pattern for the Tupolev Tu-4.

On 31 July 1944, &quot;Ramp Tramp&quot; (serial number 42-6256), of the United States Army Air Forces 462nd (Very Heavy) Bomb Group was diverted to Vladivostok, Russia, after an engine failed and the propeller could not be feathered. This B-29 was part of a 100-aircraft raid against the Japanese Showa steel mill in Anshan, Manchuria. On 20 August 1944, &quot;Cait Paomat&quot; (42-93829), flying from Chengdu, was damaged by anti-aircraft gunfire during a raid on the Yawata Iron Works. Due to the damage it sustained, the crew elected to divert to the Soviet Union. The aircraft crashed in the foothills of Sikhote-Alin mountain range east of Khabarovsk after the crew bailed out.

On 11 November 1944, during a night raid on Omura in Kyushu, Japan, the &quot;General H. H. Arnold Special&quot; (42-6365) was damaged and forced to divert to Vladivostok in the Soviet Union. The crew was interned. On 21 November 1944, &quot;Ding How&quot; (42-6358) was damaged during a raid on an aircraft factory at Omura and was also forced to divert to Vladivostok.

The interned crews of these four B-29s were allowed to escape into American-occupied Iran in January 1945, but none of the B-29s were returned after Stalin ordered the Tupolev OKB to examine and copy the B-29 and produce a design ready for quantity production as soon as possible.

Because aluminum in the USSR was supplied in different gauges from that available in the US (metric vs imperial), the entire aircraft had to be extensively re-engineered. In addition, Tupolev substituted his own favored airfoil sections for those used by Boeing, with the Soviets themselves already having their own Wright R-1820-derived 18 cylinder radial engine, the Shvetsov ASh-73 of comparable power and displacement to the B-29&#x27;s Duplex Cyclone radials available to power their design. In 1947, the Soviets debuted both the Tupolev Tu-4 (NATO ASCC code named Bull), and the Tupolev Tu-70 transport variant. The Soviets used tail-gunner positions similar to the B-29 in many later bombers and transports.

===Transition to USAF===
Production of the B-29 was phased out after WWII, with the last example completed by Boeing&#x27;s Renton factory on 28 May 1946. Many aircraft went into storage, being declared excess inventory, and were ultimately scrapped as surplus. Others remained in the active inventory and equipped the Strategic Air Command when it formed on 21 March 1946. In particular, the &quot;Silverplate&quot; modified aircraft of the 509th Composite Group remained the only aircraft capable of delivering the atomic bomb, and so the unit was involved in the Operation Crossroads series of tests, with B-29 &quot;Dave&#x27;s Dream&quot; dropping a Fat Man bomb in Test &quot;Able&quot; on 1 July 1946.

Some B-29s, fitted with filtered air sampling scoops, were used to monitor above-ground nuclear weapons testing by the US and the USSR by sampling airborne radioactive contamination. The USAF also used the aircraft for long-range weather reconnaissance (WB-29), for signals intelligence gathering (EB-29) and photographic reconnaissance (RB-29).

===Korean War and postwar service===

The B-29 was used in 1950–1953 in the Korean War. At first, the bomber was used in normal strategic day-bombing missions, although North Korea&#x27;s few strategic targets and industries were quickly destroyed. More importantly, in 1950 numbers of Soviet MiG-15 jet fighters appeared over Korea, and after the loss of 28 aircraft, future B-29 raids were restricted to night missions, largely in a supply-interdiction role.

The B-29 dropped the VB-3 &quot;Razon&quot; (a range-controllable version of the earlier Azon guided ordnance device) and the VB-13 &quot;Tarzon&quot; MCLOS radio-controlled bombs in Korea, mostly for demolishing major bridges, like the ones across the Yalu River, and for attacks on dams. The aircraft also was used for numerous leaflet drops in North Korea, such as those for Operation Moolah.

A Superfortress of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron flew the last B-29 mission of the war on 27 July 1953.

Over the course of the war, B-29s flew 20,000 sorties and dropped 200,000 tonnes (220,000 tons) of bombs. B-29 gunners were credited with shooting down 27 enemy aircraft. In turn 78 B-29s were lost; 57 B-29 and reconnaissance variants were lost in action and 21 were non-combat losses.

Soviet records show that one MiG-15 jet fighter was shot down by a B-29 during the war. This occurred on 6 December 1950, when a B-29 shot down Lieutenant N. Serikov.

With the arrival of the mammoth Convair B-36, the B-29 was reclassified as a medium bomber by the Air Force. The later B-50 Superfortress variant (initially designated B-29D) was able to handle auxiliary roles such as air-sea rescue, electronic intelligence gathering, air-to-air refueling, and weather reconnaissance.

The B-50D was replaced in its primary role during the early 1950s by the Boeing B-47 Stratojet, which in turn was replaced by the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. The final active-duty KB-50 and WB-50 variants were phased out in the mid-1960s, with the final example retired in 1965. A total of 3,970 B-29s were built.

==Variants==

The variants of the B-29 were outwardly similar in appearance but were built around different wing center sections that affected the wingspan dimensions. The wing of the Renton-built B-29A-BN used a different subassembly process and was a foot longer in span. The Georgia-built B-29B-BA weighed less through armament reduction. A planned C series with more reliable R-3350s was not built.

Moreover, engine packages changed, including the type of propellers and range of the variable pitch. A notable example was the eventual 65 airframes (up to 1947&#x27;s end) for the Silverplate and successor-name &quot;Saddletree&quot; specifications built for the Manhattan Project with Curtiss Electric reversible pitch propellers.

The other differences came through added equipment for varied mission roles. These roles included cargo carriers (CB); rescue aircraft (SB); weather ships (WB); and trainers (TB); and aerial tankers (KB).

Some were used for odd purposes such as flying relay television transmitters under the name of Stratovision.
The B-29D led progressively to the XB-44, and the family of B-50 Superfortress (which was powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360-35 Wasp Major engines).

Another role was as a mothership. This included being rigged for carrying the experimental parasite fighter aircraft, such as the McDonnell XF-85 Goblin and Republic F-84 Thunderjets as in flight lock on and offs. It was also used to develop the Airborne Early Warning program; it was the ancestor of various modern radar picket aircraft. A B-29 with the original Wright Duplex Cyclone powerplants was used to air-launch the Bell X-1 supersonic research rocket aircraft, as well as Cherokee rockets for the testing of ejection seats.

Some B-29s were modified to act as testbeds for various new systems or special conditions, including fire-control systems, cold-weather operations, and various armament configurations. Several converted B-29s were used to experiment with aerial refueling and re-designated as KB-29s. Perhaps the most important tests were conducted by the XB-29G. It carried prototype jet engines in its bomb bay, and lowered them into the air stream to conduct measurements.

Twenty-two B-29s are preserved at various museums worldwide, including two flying examples; &quot;FIFI&quot;, which belongs to the Commemorative Air Force, and &quot;Doc&quot;, which belongs to Doc&#x27;s Friends. Doc made its first flight in 60 years from Wichita, Kansas, on 17 July 2016. The public is being invited to inspect and take a short paid flight in Doc and Fifi at various venues.

Three of the Silverplate B-29s modified to drop nuclear bombs survived. Superfortress 44-86292 &quot;Enola Gay&quot; (nose number 82), which dropped the first atomic bomb, was fully restored and placed on display at the Smithsonian&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air &amp; Space Museum near Washington Dulles International Airport in 2003. The B-29 that dropped Fat Man on Nagasaki, Superfortress 44-27297 &quot;Bockscar&quot; (nose number 77), is restored and on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, posed with a replica of the Mark 3 Fat Man nuclear bomb. The third is Superfortress 45-21748, which was delivered on 9 August 1945 and is on display at the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Only two of the twenty-two museum aircraft are outside the United States: &quot;It&#x27;s Hawg Wild&quot; at the Imperial War Museum Duxford and another at the KAI Aerospace Museum in Sachon, South Korea.

==Accidents and incidents==

Notable accidents and incidents involving B-29s include:
* The 1947 crash of the Kee Bird in Greenland during a flight to the geographic North Pole, and its subsequent destruction in 1995 during a recovery attempt.
* The 1948 Waycross B-29 crash, which resulted in the &quot;United States v. Reynolds&quot; lawsuit regarding state secrets privilege.
* The 1948 Lake Mead Boeing B-29 crash during the &quot;Sun Tracker&quot; project that aimed to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile guidance system that used the sun for direction and positioning.
* The 3 November 1948 crash at Bleaklow moor near Glossop, Derbyshire, England. Much of the wreckage is still exposed and can be reached by a walk from the summit of Snake Pass, starting along the Pennine Way footpath through Devil&#x27;s Dyke.
* On 11 April 1950 a B-29 departed Kirtland Air Force Base and crashed into a mountain on Manzano Base approximately three minutes later, killing the crew. Detonators were installed in the nuclear bomb on the aircraft. The bomb case was demolished and some high-explosive (HE) material burned in the fire. Both the weapon and the capsule of nuclear material were on board but the capsule was not inserted in the bomb for safety reasons, so no nuclear detonation was possible.
*On 5 August 1950, a B-29 carrying a Mark 4 nuclear bomb crashed shortly after takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base with 20 men on board. Twelve men were killed in the crash, including Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and another seven on the ground when the aircraft exploded. The base was later renamed after Travis.

<text>Mexican hip hop is a form of hip hop music from Mexico, performed by Mexican artists and artists of Mexican descent. The growth of hip hop as a genre has led to various adaptations of it depending on a region and language.

Mexican hip hop is different from Chicano rap. Chicano rap is a subgenre of hip hop and tied more to Chicano and Mexican American experiences.

== History ==

Hip hop originated from the Bronx, New York and as it become a sensation it grew to other parts of the world. The hip-hop movement reached Mexico around the 1990s with the emergence of the group Control Machete and it has evolved to spanning more artists like Cartel de Santa, Gera MX, El Pinche Mara, Natanael Cano, and many more.

<doc id="53182" wikidata="Q868855" url="?curid=53182" title="Old-school hip-hop">
<text>Old-school hip hop (also spelled old skool) (also known as disco-rap) is the earliest commercially recorded hip hop music and the original style of the genre. It typically refers to the music created around 1979 to 1983, as well as any hip hop that does not adhere to contemporary styles.

The image, styles and sounds of old-school hip hop were exemplified by figures like Disco King Mario, DJ Hollywood, Grandmaster Flowers, Grand Wizzard Theodore, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Kool Herc, Treacherous Three, Funky Four Plus One, Kurtis Blow, The Sugarhill Gang, Melle Mel, Super-Wolf, West Street Mob, Spoonie Gee, Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee Starski, Lovebug Starski, The Cold Crush Brothers, Warp 9, T-Ski Valley, Grandmaster Caz, Doug E. Fresh, The Sequence, Jazzy Jay, Crash Crew, Rock Steady Crew, and Fab Five Freddy, Run-DMC.

It is characterized by the more straightforward rapping techniques of the time and the general focus on party-related subject matter. The lyrics were usually not a very important part of old-school rap songs, but always included shoutouts to the artist&#x27;s native New York City borough. Rap also emphasized the fashion of the time, whether it be Adidas, Kangol, Lee jeans, or the popular &quot;Sheep dog&quot; coats. However, there were some songs, such as Brother D&#x27;s &quot;How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?&quot; and Kurtis Blow&#x27;s &quot;Hard Times&quot; (both released in 1980), that explored socially relevant ideas. The release of &quot;The Message&quot; in 1982, written by Duke Bootee and Melle Mel and credited to Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five, marked the arrival of hip hop as social commentary, making it possible for future artists like Public Enemy and N.W.A to create an identity based on socially conscious themes in later years. Fun rhymes, like the &quot;Birthday Song&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s the Joint&quot; rocked the airwaves. Old-school rappers are widely respected by current hip hop artists and fans, with many claiming they have contributed to the evolution of hip hop.

==Musical characteristics and themes==
Old-school hip hop is noted for its relatively simple rapping techniques, compared to later hip hop music. Artists such as Melle Mel would use few syllables per bar of music, with simple rhythms and a moderate tempo.

Much of the subject matter of old-school hip-hop centers around partying and having a good time. In the book &quot;How to Rap&quot;, Immortal Technique explains how party content played a big part in old-school hip hop: &quot;hip-hop was born in an era of social turmoil... in the same way that slaves used to sing songs on a plantation... that&#x27;s the party songs that we used to have&quot;.

Battle rap was also a part of the old-school hip-hop aesthetic. While discussing battle rapping, Esoteric said, &quot;a lot of my stuff stems from old school hip-hop, braggadocio ethic&quot;. A famous old-school hip-hop battle occurred in December 1981, when Kool Moe Dee challenged Busy Bee Starski. Busy Bee Starski&#x27;s defeat by the more complex raps of Kool Moe Dee meant that &quot;no longer was an MC just a crowd-pleasing comedian with a slick tongue; he was a commentator and a storyteller&quot;. in the documentary &quot;Beef&quot;, KRS-One also credits this as creating a shift in rapping.

Sci-fi/Afrofuturism was another theme introduced into hip hop. The release of &quot;Planet Rock&quot; in 1982 was a game-changer, like &quot;a light being switched on.&quot; The combination of electronic percussive propulsion and Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s rap sounded like &quot;an orchestra being rocketed into outer space.&quot; &quot;Light Years Away&quot;, by Warp 9 (1983), produced and written by Lotti Golden and Richard Scher, explored social commentary from a sci-fi perspective. A &quot;cornerstone of early 80&#x27;s beatbox afrofuturism&quot;, &quot;Light Years Away&quot; is characterized as &quot;a brilliantly spare and sparse piece of electro hip-hop traversing inner and outer space.&quot;

Freestyle rap during hip hop&#x27;s old-school era was defined differently than today. Kool Moe Dee refers to this earlier definition in his book &quot;There&#x27;s a God on the Mic&quot;: &quot;There are two types of freestyle. There&#x27;s an old-school freestyle that&#x27;s basically rhymes that you&#x27;ve written that may not have anything to do with any subject or that goes all over the place. Then there&#x27;s freestyle where you come off the top of the head&quot;. This is in contrast to the more recent definition which usually defines freestyle rap as &quot;improvisational rap like a jazz solo&quot;. In old-school hip hop, Kool Moe Dee says that improvisational rapping was instead called &quot;coming off the top of the head&quot;.

Old-school hip hop often sampled disco and funk tracks, such as &quot;Good Times&quot; by Chic, when performed live in the 1970s. Recorded hip hop (such as Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;) would use a live band to do covers of the famous breaks from the 1970s block parties. However, after &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, electro-funk (the electronic Roland TR-808 drum machine recreation of the original 1970s breakbeat sound from the now infamous block parties) became the staple production technique between 1982 and 1986 (the invention of the sampler later in the 80s and Eric B. &amp; Rakim&#x27;s &quot;Eric B. Is President&quot; brought the original 1970s breakbeat sound back to hip hop, referred to today as the &quot;boom bap&quot; sound). The use of extended percussion breaks led to the development of mixing and scratching techniques. Scratching was pioneered by Grand Wizard Theodore in 1975, and the technique was further developed by other prominent DJs, such as Grandmaster Flash. One example is &quot;Adventures on the Wheels of Steel&quot;, which was composed entirely by Flash on the turntables.

Quincy Jones was an influential figure in hip-hop as a record producer for Mercury Records, and eventually became its vice president, which made him popular in hip-hop culture. He went on to publish &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine, which became a cornerstone in hip-hop history.

==History==
Old-school hip-hop typically refers to music created around 1980; however, the term may also be applied to music before this with hip-hop styles. &quot;Here Comes the Judge&quot; (1968) by Pigmeat Markham is often referred to as &quot;old-school hip hop&quot;.

<doc id="53183" wikidata="Q4045303" url="?curid=53183" title="New-school hip-hop">
<text>The new school of hip hop was a movement in hip hop music, beginning in 1983–84 with the early records of Run-DMC, Whodini, and LL Cool J. Predominantly from Queens and Brooklyn, it was characterized by Drum Machine-led minimalism, often tinged with elements of Rock; rapped taunts, boasts, and socio-political commentary; and aggressive, self-assertive delivery. In song and image, its artists projected a tough, cool, street B-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with Funk and Disco, Novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers, and party rhymes of artists prevalent in the early 1980s. Compared to their older hip hop counterparts, new school artists crafted more cohesive LPs and shorter songs more amenable to airplay. By 1986, their releases began to establish hip hop in the mainstream.

The somewhat broader era of golden age hip hop is applied to late 1980s-to-early 1990s mainstream hip hop, characterized by diversity, quality, innovation and influence, and associated with Public Enemy, KRS-One and his Boogie Down Productions, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Ultramagnetic MCs, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and the Jungle Brothers, known for themes of Afrocentricity and political militancy, experimental music, and eclectic sampling. This period is sometimes referred to as &quot;Mid-school&quot; or &quot;middle school&quot;; associated acts included Gang Starr, The UMC&#x27;s, Main Source, Lord Finesse, EPMD, Just Ice, Stetsasonic, True Mathematics, and Mantronix.

The innovations of Run-D.M.C., MC Shan, and LL Cool J, and New School Producers such as Larry Smith and Rick Rubin of Def Jam, were quickly surpassed by Beastie Boys, Marley Marl and his Juice Crew MCs, Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, and Eric B. &amp; Rakim. Hip-hop production became denser, rhymes and beats faster, as the drum machine was augmented with Sampler technology. Rakim took lyrics about the art of rapping to new heights, while KRS-One and Chuck D pushed &quot;message rap&quot; towards black activism. Native Tongues artists&#x27; inclusive, sample-crowded music accompanied their positivity, Afrocentricity, and playful energy. The new school/golden age ended with the eventual commercial dominance of West Coast gangsta rap, particularly the emergence of the relaxed sounds of G-funk by the early nineties, while the East Coast scene became dominated by hardcore rappers such as the Wu-Tang Clan and gangsta rappers such as Nas and The Notorious B.I.G.

The terms &quot;old school&quot; and &quot;new school&quot; fell into the vernacular as synonyms for &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; in hip hop, to the confusion and occasional exasperation of writers who use the terms historically. The phrase &quot;Leader of The New School&quot;, coined in hip hop by Chuck D in 1988, and given further currency by the eponymous group Leaders of the New School (who were named by Chuck D before signing with Elektra in 1989), remains popular. It has been applied to artists ranging from Jay-Z to Lupe Fiasco.

==Prehistory==

Elements of new school had existed in some form in the popular culture since hip-hop&#x27;s birth. The first MC&#x27;s rapped over DJs swapping back and forth between two copies of the same record playing the same drum break, or playing instrumental portions or versions of a broad range of records. This part of the culture was initiated by  DJ Kool Herc in 1973 using breaks from James Brown, The Incredible Bongo Band and English rock group Babe Ruth in his block parties. Brown&#x27;s music—&quot;extensive vamps&quot; in which his voice was &quot;a percussive instrument with frequent rhythmic grunts&quot;, and &quot;with rhythm-section patterns ... [resembling] West African polyrhythms&quot;—was a keynote of hip hop&#x27;s early days. By 1975, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa had taken up Kool Herc&#x27;s breakbeat style of DJing, each with their own accompanying rappers. Flash was especially associated with an important break known as &quot;The Bells&quot;—a cut-up of the intro to Bob James&#x27;s jazz cover of Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Take Me To The Mardi Gras&quot;—while Bambaataa delighted in springing occasional rock music breaks from records like &quot;Mary, Mary&quot;, &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and Grand Funk Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot; on unsuspecting b-boys.

The earliest hip-hop records replaced the DJ with a live band playing funk and disco influenced tunes, or &quot;interpolating&quot; the tunes themselves, as in &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; (Sugar Hill, 1979) and &quot;King Tim III (Personality Jock)&quot; (Spring, 1979). It was the soft, futuristic funk closely tied to disco that ruled hip hop&#x27;s early days on record, to the exclusion of the hard James Brown beats so beloved of the first b-boys. Figures such as Flash and Bambaataa were involved in some early instances of moving the sound away from that of a live band, as in Flash&#x27;s DJ track &quot;The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel&quot; (Sugar Hill, 1981), and even innovating popular new sounds and subgenres, as in the synthesizer-laden electro of Bambaataa&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot; (Tommy Boy, 1982). Often though the rawer elements present in live shows did not make it past the recording studio.

Bambaataa&#x27;s first records, for instance, two versions of &quot;Zulu Nation Throwdown&quot; (Winley, 1980), were recorded with just drums and rhymes. When Bambaataa heard the released records, a complete live band had been added. Something closer to his intentions can be heard on a portion of &quot;Death Mix&quot;, a low-quality bootleg of a Zulu Nation night at James Monroe High School in the Bronx, released without his permission on Winley Records in 1983. Likewise on the bootleg &quot;Live Convention &#x27;82&quot; (Disco Wax, 1982), Grand Wizard Theodore cuts the first six bars of Rufus Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Do the Funky Penguin&quot; together for five and a half minutes while an MC raps over the top. Grandmaster Flash&#x27;s &quot;Superrappin&#x27;&quot; (Enjoy, 1979) had a pumping syncopated rhythm and The Furious Five emulating his spinbacks and needle drops and chanting that &quot;that Flash is on the beatbox going ...&quot; The beatbox itself however, a drum machine which Flash had added to his turntable set-up some time earlier, was absent on the record, the drums being produced by a live drummer.

Kool Moe Dee&#x27;s verbal personal attacks on Busy Bee Starski live at Harlem World in 1982 caused a popular sensation in hip hop circles. In the same way, groups like the Cold Crush Brothers and The Force MCs were known for their routines, competitive attitude, and battle rhymes. Tapes of battles like these circulated widely, even without them becoming viable recordings. Apart from some social commentary like Melle Mel&#x27;s one verse on &quot;Superrappin&#x27;&quot;, Kurtis Blow&#x27;s ruefully comedic &quot;The Breaks&quot; (Mercury, 1980) and a spurt of records following the success of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five&#x27;s &quot;The Message&quot; (Sugar Hill, 1982), the old school specialized lyrically in party rhymes.

==Advent==


David Toop writes of 1984 that &quot;pundits were writing obituaries for hip hop, a passing fad&quot; which &quot;Hollywood had mutated into an all-singing, all-dancing romance&quot; in movies like &quot;Flashdance&quot; and &quot;Breakin&#x27;&quot;. Against this, Run-D.M.C., The Beastie Boys and the label Def Jam were &quot;consciously hardcore&quot;, &quot;a reaction against the populist trend in hip hop at the time&quot;, and &quot;an explosive emergence of an underground alternative&quot;. For Peter Shapiro, Run-D.M.C.&#x27;s 1983 two-song release &quot;It&#x27;s like That&quot;/&quot;Sucker MCs&quot; &quot;completely changed hip-hop&quot; &quot;rendering everything that preceded it distinctly old school with one fell swoop.&quot; In a 47-point timeline of hip hop and its antecedents spanning 64 years, Shapiro lists this release as his 43rd point. Reviewing Toop&#x27;s book in the LA Weekly, Oliver Wang of Soul Sides concurs, hailing Run-D.M.C. as inaugurating the new school of rap.

===Run-D.M.C.===
Run-D.M.C. rapped over the most sparse of musical backing tracks. In the case of &quot;Sucker MCs&quot;, there was a loud, Oberheim DMX drum machine, a few scratches and nothing else, while the rhymes harangued weak rappers and contrasted them to the group&#x27;s success. &quot;It&#x27;s like That&quot; was an aggressively delivered message rap whose social commentary has been defined variously as &quot;objective fatalism&quot;, &quot;frustrated and renunciatory&quot;, and just plain &quot;reportage&quot;. Run-D.M.C. wore street clothes, tracksuits, sneakers, one even wore glasses. Their only possible concession to an image extraneous to that of kids on the street was the stylistic flourish of black fedoras atop their heads. This stood in sharp contrast to the popular artists of the time, who had variously bedecked themselves with feathers, suede boots, jerri curls, and red or even pink leather suits.

The group&#x27;s early singles are collected on their eponymous debut (Profile, 1984), introducing rock references in &quot;Rock Box&quot;, and recognized then and now as the best album of hip hop&#x27;s early years. The next year, they appeared at Live Aid and released &quot;King of Rock&quot; (Profile, 1985), on which they asserted that they were &quot;never ever old school&quot;. &quot;Raising Hell&quot; (Profile, 1986) was a landmark, containing quintessentially hip hop tracks like &quot;Peter Piper&quot;, &quot;Perfection&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Tricky&quot;, and going platinum in the year of its release on the back of the huge crossover hit &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. The group had rapped over the beat from the 1975 original in their early days, without so much as knowing the name of the band. When &quot;Raising Hell&quot;&#x27;s producer Rick Rubin heard them playing around with it in the studio, he suggested using the Aerosmith lyrics, and the collaboration between the two groups came about. The album&#x27;s last track was &quot;Proud To Be Black&quot;, written under the influence of Chuck D of the as-yet unrecorded Public Enemy. On &quot;My Adidas&quot; the band rapped that they &quot;took the beat from the street and put it on TV&quot;.

Comments from Darryl McDaniels, AKA DMC of Run-D.M.C., make this connection to the underground explicit: &quot;[T]hat&#x27;s exactly what we did. We didn&#x27;t really think it was pioneering, we just did what rappers did before us was doing on tapes. When a lot of the old guys, like Kool Moe Dee, The Treacherous Three, and Grandmaster Flash, got in the studio, they never put their greatness on records. Me and Run and Jay would listen ... and we&#x27;d say, &#x27;They didn&#x27;t do that shit last night in the Bronx!&#x27; ... So we said that we weren&#x27;t going to be fake. We ain&#x27;t gonna wear no costumes. We&#x27;re gonna keep it real.&quot;

=== Whodini ===

Coming out of the fertile New York rap scene of the early 1980s, Whodini was one of the first rap groups to add a R&amp;B twist to their music, thus laying the foundation for a new genre, new jack swing. The group made its name with good-humored songs such as &quot;Magic&#x27;s Wand&quot; (the first rap song accompanied by a video), &quot;The Haunted House of Rock&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Five Minutes of Funk&quot;, and &quot;Freaks Come Out at Night&quot;. Live performances of the group were the first rap concerts with the participation of breakdance dancers from the group UTFO. Russell Simmons was the manager of the group in the 1980s.

The group released six studio albums. Fourteen of the group&#x27;s singles hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Four of the group&#x27;s albums were certified Platinum by the RIAA.

In 1984, the group released the second album &quot;Escape&quot;. The entire album was fully produced by Larry Smith. From the laid back groove titled &quot;Five Minutes of Funk&quot; to &quot;Friends&quot;, a cynical story of betrayal sampled everywhere from Nas&#x27; &quot;If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)&quot; to 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;Troublesome &#x27;96&quot;, to harder edged singles &quot;Freaks Come Out at Nite&quot; and &quot;Big Mouth&quot;.

In 1986, the group released a third album &quot;Back in Black&quot;, fully produced by Smith. A number of songs from the album received heavy local New York airplay, such as &quot;Funky Beat&quot; and the controversial &quot;I&#x27;m a Ho&quot;. &quot;Fugitive&quot; was guitar-driven funk and &quot;Last Night (I Had a Long Talk With...)&quot; was introspective. Paul Kodish, the drummer of Pendulum, was featured on the album.

===Def Jam===
The other production credit on &quot;Raising Hell&quot; went to Run&#x27;s brother, Russell Simmons; he ran Rush Artist Management, now Rush Communications, which as well as handling Run-D.M.C., managed the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, Whodini and Public Enemy. Simmons also co-owned Def Jam Recordings, an important new-school label, with Rubin. Simmons rose with Def Jam to become one of the biggest moguls in rap, while Rubin claimed credit for introducing radio-friendly brevity and song structure to hip hop. Def Jam&#x27;s first 12-inch release was the minimalist drum machine breakdown &quot;I Need A Beat&quot; by LL Cool J (1984). This was followed by &quot;I Can&#x27;t Live Without My Radio&quot; (Def Jam, 1985), a loud, defiant declaration of public loyalty to his boom box which the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1987 called &quot;quintessential rap in its directness, immediacy and assertion of self&quot;. Both were on his debut album for Def Jam, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Radio&quot; (described as &quot;Reduced by Rick Rubin&quot; in its liner notes), which also contained the minimalist and rock-influenced track &quot;Rock the Bells&quot;. Rubin also produced music for Beastie Boys, who sampled AC/DC on their &quot;Rock Hard&quot; EP on Def Jam in 1984 and recorded a Run-D.M.C. outtake and a heavy metal parody on their hugely commercially successful debut album &quot;Licensed To Ill&quot; (Def Jam, 1986). In 1987, &quot;Raising Hell&quot; surpassed three million units sold, and &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; five million. Faced with figures like these, major labels finally began buying into independent New York hip hop imprints.

==Further development==
===The Juice Crew===
One of hip hop&#x27;s most important producers and innovators, Marley Marl found Cold Chillin&#x27; Records and assembled various hip hop acts, including MC Shan, Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie, Roxanne Shanté, Kool G Rap &amp; DJ Polo, and Masta Ace. His Juice Crew collective was an important force in ushering the &quot;golden age&quot; era of hip hop, with advances in lyrical technique, distinctive personalities of emerging stars like Biz Markie and Big Daddy Kane, and attaining crossover commercial success for hip hop music.

Marley Marl&#x27;s first production was an &quot;answer record&quot; to &quot;Sucker MCs&quot; in 1983 entitled &quot;Sucker DJs&quot; by Dimples D. Soon after came 14-year-old Roxanne Shanté&#x27;s answer to UTFO&#x27;s &quot;Roxanne Roxanne&quot;, &quot;Roxanne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1985), sparking off the huge wave of answer records known as the Roxanne Wars. More disses (insults intended to show disrespect) from Shanté followed: &quot;Bite This&quot; (1985), &quot;Queen of Rox&quot; (1985), introducing Biz Markie on &quot;Def Fresh Crew&quot; (1986), &quot;Payback&quot; (1987), and perhaps her greatest record, &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; (1987).

===Boogie Down Productions===

Shante&#x27;s &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; had aimed some barbs at the principal two members of a new group from the Bronx called Boogie Down Productions (BDP): &quot;Now KRS-ONE you should go on vacation with that name soundin&#x27; like a wack radio station, and as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed, when T La Rock said &quot;It&#x27;s Yours&quot;, he didn&#x27;t mean his name&quot;. Boogie Down Productions had manufactured a disagreement with the Juice Crew&#x27;s MC Shan, releasing &quot;South Bronx&quot; and &quot;The Bridge is Over&quot; in reply to his &quot;The Bridge&quot; and &quot;Kill That Noise&quot; respectively.
KRS-One considered Run-D.M.C. the epitome of rap music in 1984 and had begun to rap following their lead. But he has also said that BDP&#x27;s approach reflected a feeling that the early innovators like Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J were by 1986 tainted by commercial success and out of touch with the streets.

Boogie Down&#x27;s first album &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; (B-Boy, 1987) admitted a reggae influence and had KRS-One imititating the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; on the title track. It also contained two tales of grim street life, yet played for callous laughs: &quot;The P Is Free&quot;, in which KRS speals of throwing out his girl who wants crack cocaine in exchange for sex, and &quot;9mm Goes Bang&quot;, in which he shoots a drug dealer then cheerfully sings &quot;la la la la la la&quot;. Songs like these presaged the rise of an underground that matched violent lyrics to the hardcore drum machine tracks of the new school. The cover of &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; was a further reflection of a move towards this sort of radical image, depicting the group in a half-light, holding firearms. The next album &quot;By All Means Necessary&quot; (B-Boy, 1988) left that element behind for political radicalism following the murder of Scott La Rock, with the title and cover alluding to Malcolm X. KRS-One became involved with the Stop the Violence Movement at this time. Boogie Down Productions, along with Run-D.M.C. and Public Enemy, associated the new school as rap music with a strong message.

===Eric B. &amp; Rakim===
Eric B. &amp; Rakim appeared with the Marley Marl-produced &quot;Eric B. Is President&quot; and &quot;My Melody&quot; on Zakia Records in 1986. Both tracks appeared on &quot;Paid in Full&quot; (4th &amp; Broadway, 1987). Just as B.D.P. had, the pair reflected changes in street life on their debut&#x27;s cover, which depicted the two wearing huge gold chains and surrounded by money. Like Criminal Minded, the sampling prevalent in the album cemented James Brown&#x27;s status as a hip hop source, while Rakim&#x27;s allusions showed the growing influence of mystic Nation of Islam-offshoot The Nation of Gods and Earths in hip-hop. The music was minimalist, austerely so, with many writers noting that coupled with Rakim&#x27;s precise, logical style, the effect was almost one of scientific rigour. The group followed &quot;Paid in Full&quot; with &quot;Follow The Leader&quot; (Uni, 1988), &quot;Let the Rhythm Hit &#x27;Em&quot; (MCA, 1990) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Sweat The Technique&quot; (MCA, 1992).

Rakim is generally regarded as the most cutting-edge of the MCs of the new school era.
Jess Harvell in &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in 2005 wrote that &quot;Rakim&#x27;s innovation was applying a patina of intellectual detachment to rap&#x27;s most sacred cause: talking shit about how you&#x27;re a better rapper than everyone else.&quot; Christgau in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; in 1990 wrote of Rakim&#x27;s style as &quot;calm, confident, clear. On their third album, as on their phase-shifting 1986 debut,&quot; he continues, &quot;Eric B.&#x27;s samples truly are beats, designed to accentuate the natural music of an idealized black man&#x27;s voice.&quot; Looking back at the late eighties in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1997, Moralez describes Rakim as &quot;the new-school MC of the moment, using a smooth baritone to become the jazz soloist of mystic Afrocentric rap.&quot;

===Public Enemy===

Public Enemy, having been reluctantly convinced to sign to a record label, released &quot;Yo! Bum Rush the Show&quot; on Def Jam in 1987. It debuted the Public Enemy logo, which depicted a hatted b-boy in a sniper&#x27;s crosshairs, and was replete with battle rhymes (&quot;Miuzi Weighs a Ton&quot;, &quot;Public Enemy #1&quot;), social-political fare (&quot;Rightstarter, Message to a Black Man)&quot; and anti-crack messages (&quot;Megablast&quot;).

The album was a critical and commercial success, particularly in Europe, unusually so for a hip hop album at that time. &quot;Yo! Bum Rush the Show&quot; had been recorded on the heels of Run-D.M.C.&#x27;s &quot;Raising Hell&quot;, but was held back by Def Jam in order for them to concentrate on releasing and promoting the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;License to Ill&quot;. Chuck D of Public Enemy felt that by the time their first record was released, BDP and Rakim had already changed the landscape for how an MC could rap. Public Enemy were already recording their second album &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot; (Def Jam, 1988) when &quot;Yo! Bum Rush the Show&quot; hit stores.

===Gangsta rap===
The underground sound centered on urban violence that was to become gangsta rap existed on the East Coast from soon after Run–D.M.C. had inaugurated the new school of hip hop. Philadelphia&#x27;s Schoolly D self-released &quot;Gangsta Boogie&quot; in 1984, and &quot;P.S.K. What Does It Mean?&quot;/&quot;Gucci Time&quot; in 1985, leading to &quot;Saturday Night&quot; (Schoolly D, 1986, Jive, 1987). The West Coast, which became the home of gangsta rap, had Toddy Tee&#x27;s influential &quot;Batteram&quot; mixtape in 1985, and Ice-T&#x27;s &quot;Six in the Morning&quot; in 1986 before N.W.A&#x27;s first records, leading to the hugely successful &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; in 1988.

===Native Tongues===
Developments in the New York new school continuum in this climate were represented by the Native Tongues groups—The Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Queen Latifah and Monie Love—along with fellow travellers like Leaders of the New School, KMD and Brand Nubian. They moved away from aggressive, macho posturing, towards ambiguity, fun and Afrocentricity. Their music was sample-crowded, more open and accessible than their new school predecessors. De La Soul&#x27;s debut sampled everyone from The Turtles to Steely Dan, while A Tribe Called Quest matched tough beats to mellow jazz samples and playful, thoughtful raps.

==Notes==

a. &quot;A few weeks ago I was DJing a party and a young twentysomething came up to me to request &#x27;some old-school.&#x27; I asked for clarification – after all, Run DMC and LL Cool J are considered old-school, but technically, they invented the new school. The response: &#x27;I don&#x27;t know, some Tribe Called Quest or something.&#x27; After gently picking my jaw from off the floor, I turned back to my crates and wondered to myself, &#x27;If Tribe is old-school, what does that make Kurtis Blow? In utero?&#x27;&quot;—Oliver Wang, &quot;Book report&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Bay Guardian&quot;, April 6, 2003.

b. &quot;I always get frustrated when I see a link to this site on some hipster&#x27;s blog with a tagline like &#x27;taking it back to the old school&#x27;, when I very rarely post anything recorded before 1989. I mean, I guess a lot of what I post here is old, but that don&#x27;t make it old school, yaoming? Like how you gonna call Leaders of the New School old school?&quot;—Noz, &quot;Lady Don&#x27;t Tek No Beat&quot;, &quot;Cocaine Blunts and Hip Hop Tapes&quot;, January 10, 2005.

<text>French hip hop or French rap (, ), is the hip hop music style developed in French-speaking countries. France is the second largest hip-hop market in the world after the United States.

==History==

===Beginning of French hip hop: the 70s and 80s===
By 1982 and 1983, a number of hip hop radio shows had appeared on Paris radio, including &quot;Rapper Dapper&quot; (hosted by Sidney Duteil) and &quot;Funk à Billy&quot; (hosted by DJ Dee Nasty). In November 1982 the New York City Rap Tour traveled around France and to London featuring Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmixer DST, Fab 5 Freddy, Mr Freeze and the Rock Steady Crew.

The first major star of French hip hop was MC Solaar. Born Claude M&#x27;Barali in Dakar, Senegal, he moved as a child to France in 1970 and lived in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges. His 1991 album, &quot;Qui sème le vent récolte le tempo&quot;, was a major hit. The European Music Office&#x27;s report on Music in Europe said that the French language was well-suited for rapping. He set many records, including being the first French hip hop recording artist to go platinum. Some artists claim that the French language hip hop style was influenced by the music of French singer Renaud.

Following MC Solaar&#x27;s breakthrough, two broad styles emerged within the French hip hop scene; artists such as Solaar, Dee Nasty, and Lionel D championed a more mellow, sanguine style, while more hardcore performers such as Assassin and Suprême NTM assumed a more aggressive aesthetic. Many such artists found themselves at the heart of controversies over lyrics that were seen as glorifying the murder of police officers and other crimes, similar to outcries over violent thuggish lyrics in American gangsta rap. The cases include the notorious Ministère AMER&#x27;s &quot;Sacrifice de poulet&quot;, NTM&#x27;s &quot;Police&quot; and later Lunatic&#x27;s &quot;Le crime paie&quot;.

===Influence of American hip-hop===
French hip-hop, like hip-hop in other countries, is highly influenced by American hip-hop. Columnist David Brooks wrote that &quot;ghetto life, at least as portrayed in rap videos, now defines for the young, poor and disaffected what it means to be oppressed. Gangsta resistance is the most compelling model for how to rebel against that oppression.&quot; He argued that the gangster image of American hip hop appeals to mostly young &amp; impoverished immigrant minorities in France, as a means to oppose the racism and oppression they experience. Jody Rosen counters Brooks&#x27; argument, criticizing that Brooks makes use of only a few, old samples of potential French gangsta rap that contain violent or misogynistic lyrics, and asserting that Brooks fails to accurately assess French hip hop&#x27;s larger scope and discounts its potential for &quot;rappers of amazing skill, style, and wit.&quot;

Francophone rap was given a boost in the early 21st century by a decision of the French ministry of culture, which insisted that French-language stations play a minimum of 40 percent of French-language music during transmission.

This makes up one quarter of the radio&#x27;s top 100, ten percent of local music production and has sold hundreds of thousands of CDs. French hip hop, however, is often criticized for imitating American hip hop style. French rapper MC Solaar agrees sarcastically, saying, &quot;French rap is pretty much a U.S. branch office... we copy everything, don&#x27;t we? We don&#x27;t even take a step back.&quot;

Parts of American hip-hop culture have left a mark on the culture of French hip-hop as well in terms of fashion, clothing, music videos, jewelry, sounds and other things. Hip-hop culture was imported from America, especially with the influence of New York rappers and the music that came out of New York.

===The 1990s and 2000s===

Through the 1990s, the music grew to become one of the most popular genres in France; in 1997, IAM&#x27;s release &quot;L&#x27;école du Micro d&#x27;Argent&quot; sold more than 1 million discs, with NTM moving more than 700,000 copies of their final album &quot;Suprême NTM&quot;. The group went their separate ways in 2000.

As hip hop moved into a new millennium, French hip hop artists developed rapidly, seeing commercial success, and even some international appeal. One of the most influential French hip hop albums of all time, Cinquième As, was released by MC Solaar in 2001. At the same time, new artists like Sinik and Diam&#x27;s began to see significant success, as well, bringing a new sound and genre of lyrical prowess to the game.

==Themes==

Themes in French hip hop include opposition to the social order, humor and puns, as well as ethnic and cultural identity. Whereas early French hip hop was seen as mimicking American hip hop in terms of aesthetic appeal, later French rappers added their own cultural and ethnic identities to the mix. With the rise of IAM&#x27;s pharaoism, or allusions to ancient Egyptian pharaohs, the French hip hop artists are seen attempting to negotiate and create a space for themselves in a social scene rife with discrimination and racist ideologies.

French hip hop can be defined by two major categories or subgenres: hip-hop from the north, mainly centered around major cities like Paris and its suburbs, and hip-hop from the south which focuses around cities like Marseille. The different social climates in the regions make the two subgenres distinct from one another. Lyrics from the south tend to be more socially conscious, with content mainly focusing on the fight against discrimination. Rappers from the south of France are known to tell the &#x27;cold reality&#x27; of life in France. In the north, however, content tends to be more straightforward, with rappers typically talking about the drug trade, gang wars, ghetto life and clashes with the police, etc.

Many of the French hip hop artists come from the poor urban areas on the outskirts of large cities known as &quot;banlieues&quot; (&quot;suburbs&quot;). Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Nantes, Lille, Strasbourg, Rennes, Caen, Le Havre, Rouen, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Grenoble and Nice have produced various French hip hop artists. The political and social status of the minority immigrant groups living in France have a direct influence on French hip hop. 

French hip hop has been political in its history as well. Hip-hop in France owes its success to a strong social demand for it. Historically, France adopted a series of hostile policy against immigrant families. For example, a contentious debate is currently being fought out in the political realm as to whether or not Muslim women should be permitted to wear head scarves. Domestic policy in the period since decolonization has resulted in the development of stifling set of inequalities. Most of these political outcries and demands are coming from the younger generation. Hip-Hop remains to be a place where young people can express their needs and themselves politically and freely.

The protest at the heart of French hip-hop can be traced directly to the economic boom following World War II. France required manpower to sustain its newly booming industries and the governmental solution was the mass immigration of peoples from regions of past French colonial empire to fill the gaps caused by shortage in personnel. As early as 1945, &quot;l&#x27;Office national d&#x27;immigration&quot; (ONI) was formed to supervise the immigration of new workers. Newly arrived Africans were not given the same employment opportunities as their French Caribbean counterparts because they were not citizens and often Africans ended up working as civil servants and menial employees living in dilapidated housing projects. Much of the resistance to social and economic imbalances in French hip-hop relate to this historically unequal situation. This is proved by lyrics of Aktivist&#x27;s song, &quot;Ils ont&quot;, the extract when translated states &quot;Aktivist denounces intolerance to all immigrant fathers/Exploited in France since the 50s-60s/...their bodies are falling apart/And their children are still being judged according to their origins.

==Relationship with Africa and the Caribbean==
When hip-hop reached the European continent in the 1980s Afrika Bambaataa was an early pioneer, and when he came to France he was overwhelmed by the great importance of African culture coming from Africa and the Caribbean.

Many French hip hop artists express strong ties to Africa, though not overtly. Rappers from the 1980s and 90s needed to keep their references to Africa subtle for a few reasons. First, explicitly praising Africa would have been offensive to the many immigrants who fled Algeria and other North African countries because of the economic adversity they faced there, and many rappers probably had parents who had done so. Also, obvious Afrocentrism would have provided the French anti-Maghrebi extreme right with an opportunity to tell Maghrebi immigrants to return to North Africa. And finally, rising conservative Islamism in North Africa would have prevented rappers from being able to imitate their behavior in their native land.

The progress of rap in France is associated with the postcolonial relationships founded with former colonies of Africa and the Caribbean. Therefore, the definition of Africa according to French ideas, and the nature of racism in French society is crucial to understanding the reason for the hip hop and rap sensation in France. Rappers are overwhelmingly of African descent, and in tackling the issue of their invisibility in French society and declaring their origins, they redefine their identity and defy French notions of ethnicity and citizenship.

Some French hip hop artists of African origin have used their music to address challenges and issues that cause poverty in African nations. The French hip hop group Bisso Na Bisso&#x27;s song &quot;Dans la peau d&#x27;un chef&quot; refers to the corruption of African heads of state. Though their music and the issues they cover focus more on their home country, the Republic of the Congo, all members of Bisso Na Bisso live in France and rap in French. Although many artists that have dominated the hip hop scene in France are of African descent, themes dealing with the intimate connection between France and various African countries tend not to get much promotion on mainstream radio and even less consideration in scholarly research on the subject. While the popularity of nationally grown rap in France grew with the presence of MC Solaar, his involvement in the overall French hip hop subculture is non-existent as many consider his work to be in the traditional vein of French pop.

Specifically, IAM incorporates many African-related themes into its music. Their 1991 song &quot;Les tam-tam de l&#x27;Afrique&quot; was one of the first French rap hits to deal explicitly with slavery. This particular track &quot;focused on the plunder of Africa, the abduction of its inhabitants, the Middle Passage, and the plantation system in the Americas.&quot; It uses a sample from a Stevie Wonder song called &quot;Past Time Paradise&quot;, which, appropriately, touches on race relations and slavery as well. Many other French hip hop artists made similar statements through their music, by collaborating to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in France in 1998. In order to mark the anniversary of the abolition of slavery in Martinique (which is an overseas department of France in the Caribbean), on May 22, Paris&#x27;s Olympia theater hosted a concert that opened with &quot;drummers chained together&quot; and featured performances from &quot;rappers of African descent such as Doc Gyneco, Stomy Bugsy, Arsenik, and Hamed Daye.&quot;

IAM also incorporates images associated with ancient Egypt. Several group members assumed names reflective of this influence. For example, IAM member Eric Mazel goes by the name Kheops, the name of the builder of the Egyptian pyramids.

The African music influences in French hip hop also extend to the use of African instruments such as the Kora, balafon, and ngoni. Many of the drums played in Africa and the Caribbean music such as &quot;derbuka from North Africa, djembe from Senegal, gwo ka drums from Guadeloupe, bèlè drums from Martinique and Dominica, zouk, bouyon music, etc.). The mixture of the diverse traditional African, Caribbean, and other instrumentals is what produced the French hip-hop and made it distinct.

Today, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and it&#x27;s global diaspora, especially in Belgium and France has brought about some of the largest and fastest growing French-language rap singers. Traditional Congolese music including in the local Lingala language has become popular globally including by artists with Congolese origin such as Tiakola, Dadju, Damso, and GIMS all of which have worked with Congolese singer, Fally Ipupa.

===French Antilles hip hop===
The French Antilles hip hop is a style of hip hop music originating from the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. Usually in French and Antillean creole, the French Antilles hip hop is most popular in the French Antilles and France.

Sidney Duteil (born Patrick Duteil in 1955 in Argenteuil, Val-d&#x27;Oise), better known as Sidney, is a French musician, rapper, DJ, television and radio host, and occasional actor of Guadeloupean origin. He is well known in France for his connection with the beginnings of the French hip hop scene.

==Language==

Although hip hop in France has been greatly influenced by American hip hop culture, the lyrics remain typically in French. Other than English, other language influences are based on oral traditions such as African griots, &quot;talk over&quot; of Jamaica and the blues. French music lyrics typically feature puns, play on words and suggestive phonetic combinations. Such artists as Boby Lapointe often use alliterations, onomatopoeia and puns or double entendre lyrics. The dialect of choice for many hip hop artists in France is verlan which is based on the inverse of original French words. In some cases artists rap in several different languages on a track including Arabic, French and English. The purpose of the lyrics, no matter the language, is &quot;to popularize and vent the anger and frustrations of many disadvantaged and sometimes mistreated individuals, and to defend the cause of the poorest and least socially integrated segment of French society&quot;.

French hip hop stands out for its &quot;flowing, expressive tones of the language [that] give it a clear identity within the rap world.&quot; In many French rap songs, verlan is used which is a slang that twists words by reversing and recombining them. This makes it difficult for even French speaking listeners to understand what the MC is saying. Even though it is difficult at times to understand completely the lyrics that are being said rappers still get the heat for causing violence and disturbance within society because of their intense message of rebelling against the system.

It is said that one of the most interesting points about French rap is the idea that &quot;poetry and philosophy are greatly esteemed in France, and that they&#x27;re even more greatly esteemed in French.&quot;

David Brooks claims that French rap is a copy of American gangsta rap of the early 1990s. However, his position was attacked by Jody Rosen in his article which debunks Brooks&#x27;s belief that the French hip hop scene is no more than a carbon copy of earlier American work.

Like much of the hip hop from the United States, many French hip hop artists use the genre to address pressing social issues. The authors of &quot;Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Rai, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identity&quot; state that French rappers rap about &quot;the history of slavery, humanity&#x27;s origins in Africa, Europe&#x27;s destruction of African civilizations and the independence struggle led by the Front De Liberation Nationale.&quot; The components of their music are mostly influenced by the American rappers, but they also have their own style such as having their culture&#x27;s tune in the beat. And they rap in their language and their phonetic sounds differ in time to time.

As France has embraced hip hop, they put a huge emphasis on the lyrics. They love to sing about love and poetry, and they also love to rap in French dialect. The French government has a mandate that 40 percent of the music played on the radio must be in French. Hip hop is a way for artists to express these feelings. More precisely, a hip hop built of French language lyrics laid on top of traditional break beats and samples.

== Influence on pop culture==

The image of the &quot;banlieue&quot;, comparable to what in the United States would be called one&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, has propagated itself into French pop culture in the form of clothing, accessories, attitude and of course the hip-hop music it yields. This fascination with the banlieue image has also found its way into the big screen with the movie B-13. This action/martial arts film depicts a somewhat exaggerated view of what one of the worst suburbs (which is what banlieue means, roughly translated) would be like 6 years in the future. One finds within this movie almost every iconic paradigm inherent to the gangster image in the U.S. We have a plethora of drugs and guns. We have a Don Corleone/&quot;Scarface&quot; figure who, under the influence of enough of his own product, considers himself invincible. There is, of course, a general disdain for corrupt police and politicians, and last but not least, there is the unfair imprisonment of the protagonist. The aforementioned traits contained the sub-plots of &quot;Menace II Society&quot;, &quot;Juice&quot;, &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, &quot;Belly&quot; and &quot;New Jack City&quot; among other movies considered pivotal to gangsta rap culture. The obvious parallels seen in the glorification of the banlieue and that of one&#x27;s &quot;hood&quot; is not one to overlook. The commonalities in the two cultures are indicative of the fact that a.) almost every hip hop movement was bred from necessity and from rebellion. The guns, drugs and money of the hood are typically not the aftermath of an easy life but the result of a struggle whether it is as a hustler or as a gangbanger. Hip-hop provides an outlet for people in the struggle to lash out at the powers that be, and to rebel in some small way against the life they&#x27;re stuck in. b.) the glorification of the banlieue also reminds us that there will always be a consumerist market of people, not in the struggle, who will take advantage of the allure of the image without totally understanding it.

Such as much of the rap and hip hop in the United States talks about money, women, guns, etc., rap in France is also somewhat following this path. Yet, many artists still rap about their ties to Africa, culture, and sending out important messages. However, hip hop in France is taking on the same image as hip hop in the United States. It&#x27;s changed to talking about gang-banging and other illegal activities. Not only in France, but in many African countries, French hip hop is played and heard. &quot;The images, modes and attitudes of hip-hop and gangsta rap are so powerful they are having a hegemonic effect across the globe.&quot;

==Breakdancing==
The break-dancing scene in France is widespread, and some French B-boys are well known for taking part in competitions such as BOTY. Two of the most well-known crews from France are the Vagabonds and the Pockemon, as both of them won the BOTY.

<doc id="53186" wikidata="Q945056" url="?curid=53186" title="Sam Snead">
<text>Samuel Jackson Snead (; May 27, 1912 – May 23, 2002) was an American professional golfer who was one of the top players in the world for the better part of four decades (having won PGA of America and Senior PGA Tour events over six decades) and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. Snead was awarded a record 94 gold medallions, for wins in PGA of America (referred to by most as the PGA) Tour events and later credited with winning a record 82 PGA Tour events tied with Tiger Woods, including seven majors. He never won the U.S. Open, though he was runner-up four times. Snead was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974.

Snead&#x27;s nicknames included &quot;The Slammer&quot;, &quot;Slammin&#x27; Sammy Snead&quot;, and &quot;The Long Ball Hitter from West Virginia&quot;, and he was admired by many for having a &quot;perfect swing&quot;, which generated many imitators. Snead was famed for his folksy image, wearing a straw hat, and making such statements as &quot;Keep close count of your nickels and dimes, stay away from whiskey, and never concede a putt.&quot; and &quot;There are no short hitters on the tour anymore, just long and unbelievably long.&quot; Fellow West Virginia Golf Hall of Fame Inductee Bill Campbell has said of Snead, &quot;He was the best natural player ever. He had the eye of an eagle, the grace of a leopard, and the strength of a lion.&quot; Gary Player once said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any question in my mind that Sam Snead had the greatest golf swing of any human being that ever lived.&quot; Jack Nicklaus said that Snead&#x27;s swing was &quot;so perfect... and the most fluid motion in the game of golf&quot;.

==Awards==
Snead was the PGA leading money winner in 1938, 1949 and 1950. He won the Vardon Trophy, for lowest scoring average, four times: 1938, 1949, 1950, and 1955. In 1949, he was PGA Golfer of the Year.

Snead was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1973. In 1986, Snead was inducted into the Middle Atlantic PGA Hall of Fame. Snead was also inducted into the PGA of America Hall of Fame and the Helms Hall of Fame. Snead received the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. In 2009, Snead was inducted into the inaugural class of the West Virginia Golf Hall of Fame and in 2016, Snead was the unanimous top choice for inclusion in the Virginia Golf Hall of Fame&#x27;s inaugural class.

Born in Ashwood, Virginia, near Hot Springs, Snead began caddying at age seven at The Homestead&#x27;s Old Course in Hot Springs. He worked as an assistant pro at The Homestead at 17 in 1929, then moved to the Cascades Course and turned professional in 1934. During the depression, Snead taught himself the game of golf from a set of clubs carved from tree limbs. Snead joined the PGA Tour in 1936 and achieved immediate success by winning the West Virginia Closed Pro tournament.

In 1936 he won two matches at the Meadow Brook Club, earning a $10,000 prize. This gave him the money he needed to start playing professionally full-time. In 1944 he became resident playing professional at The Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, and maintained ties to Hot Springs and The Homestead all of his life. During the winter, he was a resident playing pro at the Boca Raton Resort from 1956 to 1969. Each spring he returned to the Mid-Atlantic, stopping at The Masters Tournament on his way back to The Greenbrier.

Snead served in the U.S. Navy during World War II from 1942 to 1944. He was an athletic specialist in Cmdr. Gene Tunney&#x27;s program in San Diego, and was given a medical discharge for a back injury in September 1944.

Snead appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, &quot;The Colonel Breaks Par&quot;, in 1957.

His nephew, J. C. Snead, was also a successful professional golfer, winning tournaments on both the PGA Tour and the Champions Tour.

==Career==
In July 1936, Snead won his first tournament, the West Virginia Closed Pro, contested at The Greenbrier&#x27;s Championship Course and Old White Course. He shot rounds of 70–61 to rout Logan, West Virginia professional, Clem Wiechman by 16 strokes (74-73). The following month, he won the first of 17 West Virginia Open championships by beating Art Clark by five strokes at Guyan Country Club in Huntington, West Virginia.

In 1937, Snead&#x27;s first full year on the PGA Tour, he won six events, including the Oakland Open at Claremont Country Club in California and his second West Virginia Open. In Snead&#x27;s debut in the U.S. Open hosted at Oakland Hills, he finishes runner-up to Ralph Guldahl (who won with 19 clubs in his bag). Snead shared the first round lead shooting 69 with fellow West Virginian Denny Shute (1936 and 1937 PGA Champion). In Snead&#x27;s first of two attempts in The Open Championship, he finished tied for 11th. While working at The Greenbrier, Snead played in the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships. In the first round, he faced the eventual winner Karel Kozeluh, losing to Kozeluh by scores of 6–1, 6–1, and 6–1.

In 1938, Snead first won the Greater Greensboro Open, the first of eight times, the Tour record for victories in a single tournament event. Snead&#x27;s last win at Greensboro was in 1965, at the age of , making him the oldest player to win a PGA Tour event. Snead introduced his first book, &quot;Sam Snead&#x27;s quick way to better golf&quot;.

In 1939, Snead won three times. 1939 was the first of four times (although Snead had already come close in 1937, losing to the eventual champion who had 19 clubs in his bag) where Snead failed at crucial moments of the U.S. Open, the only major event he never won. Needing a par to win at the Philadelphia C.C., but not knowing that, since on-course scoreboards did not exist at that time, Snead posted a triple-bogey 8 on the par-5 72nd hole, taking a risky shot from a difficult lie in the fairway. Snead had been told on the 18th tee by a spectator that he needed a birdie to win. Snead ended up in fifth place, two shots behind three players who went into a playoff.

During World War II, Snead was prevented from participating in 14 major championships (1940–1945 Open Championship, 1942–1945 U.S. Open, 1943–1945 Masters, 1943 PGA Championship), due to their cancellations. Snead served in the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1944.

In 1946, Snead won six times including the Open Championship at St Andrews. His expenses for playing there were more than three times his winning purse. Snead tied for sixth in the Open in 1962. Snead introduced the book, &quot;Sam Snead&#x27;s How to play golf, and professional tips on improving your score. Also, rules of the game of golf, as approved by the United States Golf Association, and by the Royal and ancient golf club of St. Andrews&quot;.

At the U.S. Open in 1947, Snead missed a putt on the final playoff hole to finish runner-up to Lew Worsham.

Snead won three times in 1948, including his first Texas Open and fourth West Virginia Open.

In 1949, Snead won nine PGA events including two majors including the Masters and the PGA Championship and was awarded Golfer of the Year. For Snead, it was the third of four second-place finishes at the U.S. Open, the only major championship he never won. Needing two pars to finish in a tie for the lead, Snead took three shots to hole out his ball from the fringe of the green on the 17th hole.

In 1950, Snead won 11 events, placing him third in that category behind Byron Nelson (18, in 1945) and Ben Hogan (13, in 1946). Snead claimed that 1950 was his &quot;greatest year&quot; winning &quot;eleven tournaments&quot; including a playoff victory over Hogan in the L.A. Open yet lost the &quot;Golfer of the Year&quot; to Hogan, who won one &quot;tournament&quot;. His scoring average of 69.23 was a Vardon Trophy record that stood for 50 years.

In 1952, Snead won ten events including the Masters. At the Jacksonville Open, Snead forfeited rather than play an 18-hole playoff against Doug Ford after the two golfers finished in a tie at the end of regulation play. The forfeit stemmed from a ruling Snead received during the tournament&#x27;s second round of play. On the 10th hole, Snead&#x27;s drive landed behind an out-of-bounds stake. While Chick Harbert, who was playing with Snead, thought the ball was out of bounds, a rules official ruled differently due to the starter not telling players the stakes had been moved after the previous day&#x27;s play had ended. Afterward, Snead explained why he forfeited even though Ford suggested they play sudden death for the title. &quot;I want to be fair about it. I don&#x27;t want anyone to think I took advantage of the ruling.&quot; Snead set the record for most PGA wins after reaching age 40, with 17.

In 1953, Snead won three events. He finished runner-up to Ben Hogan at the U.S. Open (the fourth time he would finish runner-up at the U.S. Open).

In 1954, Snead won two events, one of which was the Masters in an 18-hole playoff over Ben Hogan.

In December 1959, Snead took part in a controversial match against Mason Rudolph, at the Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda. The match played under the NBC&#x27;s &quot;World Championship Golf&quot; series, was a match-play event that was tied after 11 holes. On the 12th hole, Snead discovered that he had a 15th club in the bag, a violation of the Rules of Golf that limits a player to 14 clubs. The extra club in his bag, a fairway wood Snead had been experimenting with in practice, meant Rudolph had won on the 12th hole immediately, 11 and 7, after applying the penalty of a loss of hole for each hole the club was in the bag, even though he did not use it during the round. With the match legally concluded, Snead deliberately missed puts later in the program to create the legitimate result, a Rudolph win. Snead explained the match had ended up on the 11 loss of hole penalties, and said he did not disqualify himself in order not to spoil the show. This occurred shortly after the investigations into the quiz show scandals where players were given answers to questions in fixed matches. The match was broadcast in April 1960, and the sponsor canceled further participation in the series after Snead&#x27;s admission he recreated the result after the match officially ended as a Rudolph win. The rule was changed for the 1964 Rules of Golf, where the penalty is capped at two holes (match play) or two strokes per hole capped at four strokes (stroke play).

Beginning in 1960, Snead hosted television&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Golf&quot; program, emceed by Harry von Zell, competing for charity in nine-hole contests against Hollywood celebrities like Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope. Snead had appeared with Martin and Lewis in their 1953 comedy film, &quot;The Caddy&quot;.

On February 7, 1962, at age 49, Snead won the Royal Poinciana Plaza Invitational, an LPGA Tour &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; tournament where he faced off against 14 LPGA pros. The low woman was Mickey Wright, herself Snead&#x27;s equivalent in women&#x27;s golf, with the most wins on that tour.

His 1962 autobiography was titled &quot;The Education of a Golfer.&quot; Snead later wrote several golf instructional books, and frequently wrote instructional columns in golf magazines.

In 1965, Snead became the oldest player (52 years, 10 months, and 8 days) to win on the PGA Tour (the Greater Greensboro Open).

Snead played on seven Ryder Cup teams: 1937, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1955, and 1959. Snead was selected to the 1939 Ryder Cup team however the event was never played due to World War II. He captained the team in 1951, 1959, and 1969.

In 1971, he won the PGA Club Professional Championship at Pinehurst Resort.

In 1973, Snead became the oldest player to make a cut in a U.S. Open at age 61.

In 1974, at age 61, he shot a third-round 66 at the Los Angeles Open at Riviera Country Club to move into contention. A birdie at #17 in the last round moved him to within one stroke of the lead. Dave Stockton hit a miraculous fairway wood on the final hole. Snead was joint runner-up.

He shot a final-round 68 at the 1974 PGA Championship to finish tied for third, three strokes behind winner Lee Trevino. At age 62, it was Snead&#x27;s third consecutive top-10 finish at the PGA Championship, but his last time in contention at a major.

In 1978, he won the first Legends of Golf event, which was the impetus for the creation, two years later, of the Senior PGA Tour, now the Champions Tour.

In 1979, he was the youngest PGA Tour golfer to shoot his age (67) in the second round of the 1979 Quad Cities Open. He shot under his age (66) in the final round.

In 1982, he teamed with Don January to shoot 27-under-par to win the rain-shortened 54-hole Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf event at Onion Creek Club &quot;The Birthplace of the Senior PGA Tour&quot; in Austin, Texas. This victory would mark victories for Snead that spanned over six decades (1930s–1980s) winning tour and senior tour events.

In 1983, at age 71, he shot a round of 60 (12-under-par) at The Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia.

In 1986, Snead wrote the book, &quot;Pigeons, Marks, Hustlers and Other Golf Bettors You Can Beat&quot;.

In 1997, at age 85, he shot a round of 78 at the Old White course of The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.

In 1998, he received the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award, the fourth person to be so honored.

From 1984 to 2002, he hit the honorary starting tee shot at the Masters Tournament. Until 1999, he was joined by Gene Sarazen, and until 2001, by Byron Nelson.

In 2000, Snead was ranked the third greatest golfer of all time, in &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine&#x27;s rankings, behind only Jack Nicklaus and Ben Hogan.

==Death==

Snead died in Hot Springs, Virginia in 2002 following complications from a stroke, four days before his 90th birthday. He was survived by two sons: Sam Jr. of Hot Springs, and Terry, of Mountain Grove, Virginia, and a brother, Pete, of Pittsburgh, as well as two grandchildren. His wife Audrey died in 1990. His nephew J. C. Snead was also a PGA Tour golfer.

==In popular culture==
Snead was mentioned several times in the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; at the height of his popularity during the 1950s and 1960s. As its creator and avid golfer Charles M. Schulz said in a 1971 interview: &quot;I was a great admirer of Sam Snead. I once watched him play a round in the St. Paul tournament when he hit every green in regulation figures – and all the par fives in two – for a truly flawless round.&quot;

He played himself in the 1951 Ben Hogan semi-autobiographical movie starring Glenn Ford and Anne Baxter called &quot;Follow the Sun.&quot;

There is a Sam Snead Street in San Antonio, Texas.

==Playing style==
During his peak years, Snead was an exceptionally long driver, particularly into the wind, with very good accuracy as well. He was a superb player with the long irons. Snead was also known for a very creative short game, pioneering the use of the sand wedge for short shots from grass. As he aged, he began to experiment with different putting styles. Snead pioneered croquet-style putting in the 1960s, where he straddled the ball with one leg on each side. The United States Golf Association banned this technique in 1968 by amending the old Rule 35–1, since, until that time, golfers had always faced the ball when striking. Snead then went to side-saddle putting, where he crouched and angled his feet towards the hole, and held the club with a split grip. He used that style for the rest of his career.

<text>Italian hip hop is hip hop music rapped in the Italian language and/or made by Italian artists. One of the first hip hop crews to catch the attention of the Italian mainstream was Bologna&#x27;s Isola Posse All Star, then and still today produced by Sandro Orru, who had written the soundtrack to the animated Signor Rossi TV series Signor Rossi in the 1970s. The European Music Office&#x27;s report on &quot;Music in Europe&quot; claimed that in general, hip hop from the south of Italy tends to be harder than that from the north.

==History==

===1980s===
In the early 1980s, hip hop spread to Italy through posse cuts, which were popular in social centers, alternative centers where several left-wing young people regularly meet, and where the extremely influential Italian hardcore punk scene was flourishing, from which the Italian posse cut movement inherited its social conscious. The first star to emerge from this scene was Jovanotti, who would rap in otherwise standard Italian pop. While Jovanotti was discovered by the famous producer Claudio Cecchetto and quickly reached fame, in the underground Radical Stuff published the first Italian hip hop street video Let&#x27;s Get Dizzy, featuring lo Greco Bros in 1989. Also that year, Marko Von Schoenberg of Stone Castle Records in Italy produced Dre&#x27; n OG along with Andre Herring (now known as the King of Art) and Nathaniel Goodwin, with songs such as AK-47, Got Damn, Do Beat, and Spread Your Legs. But DRE and OG never received any payments for recordings.

Underground hip hop group Assalti Frontali, was founded in Rome in 1988. They are known for their left-wing politically and socially charged lyrics. 
===1990s===
In 1991, the posse cut movement produced its first underground rap in the Italian language, with tracks such as &quot;Stop al panico&quot; by Isola Posse All Star, a track against murders and violence in the streets.

Articolo 31, formed by J-Ax and DJ Jad: they started out as a mainly East Coast hip hop-inspired hip hop duo, rapped in two commercials (for big companies such as Fiat and Big Bubble) in 1993. The duo had always been criticized for their connection to the Italian pop music market. In 1996, as they started their performance at Venice&#x27;s hip hop festival, the others rappers left the stage as a symbolic protest against them. 

Later that decade, a dissing battle started between them and the Zero Stress Crew (formed by Sangue Misto and Radical Stuff). Other important crews and rappers included Bologna&#x27;s Porzione Massiccia Crew, Sangue Misto (project born from Isola Posse All Star), with their 1994 album SXM, which has influenced all subsequent Italian hip hop tracks.

At the end of 1999, the Milanese group Sacre Scuole, made up of Jake La Furia, Gué Pequeno and Dargen D&#x27;Amico, released the album &quot;3 MC&#x27;s al cubo&quot;.

The group Gemelli DiVersi was founded in 1997, it is a group which blends hip hop with vocal harmonies, and often with socially conscious lyrics. Their first single was the Pooh sampling &quot;Un attimo ancora&quot; (1998). The group had a peak of success in the 2000s, with songs such as &quot;Un altro ballo&quot; (2004), &quot;Vivi per un miracolo&quot; (2007) and their biggest hit, &quot;Mary&quot; (2003).

===2000s===
At the beginning of the new millennium, the Apulian rapper Caparezza achieves success with the album &quot;Verità supposte&quot;. In 2001, the group Sottotono took part in the Sanremo Music Festival and then broke up shortly after. After the dissolution of the Articolo 31 and the abandonment of Neffa from the rap scene, there is a period of fatigue for the Italian scene that awakens with some productions: first of all we must remember &quot;Mi fist&quot; by Club Dogo, 60 Hz by DJ Shocca, &quot;Fabiano detto Inoki&quot; by Inoki, &quot;Mondo Marcio&quot; by Mondo Marcio, and above all &quot;Mr. Simpatia&quot; by Fabri Fibra. 

Although the Italian hip hop scene remains firm in the underground, the record market, and headed by independent labels such as Portafoglio Lainz or Vibra Records. In 2006, several MCs manage to get a record deal with major majors: Mondo Marcio, a Milanese rapper, signs for EMI, Inoki with Warner, Fabri Fibra and Club Dogo with Universal, while Cor Veleno sign for H2O Music, being the first Italian artists to exploit digital music. Some video clips, such as that of &quot;Applausi per Fibra&quot; by Fabri Fibra, manage to reach broadcasters such as AllMusic or MTV and gain decent positions in the charts. Between 2006 and 2008, the genre expands to a wider audience, initially thanks to the album &quot;Solo un uomo&quot; by Mondo Marcio, which brought the genre to the general public in Italy, then followed by the albums &quot;Tradimento&quot; by Fabri Fibra and &quot;Marracash&quot; by Marracash, who managed to conquer the top positions in the standings.

Meanwhile in Rome, among all the hip hop groups, the Truceklan was establishing itself, created by the union of the hip hop groups Truceboys and In the Panchine. Among the main members of the group stood out: Noyz Narcos, Metal Carter, Gel, Cole, Gemello, Chicoria, Benassa, Duke Montana (who left the group in 2011) and Zinghero. While on the production side: Lou Chano, DJ Sano Volcano, 3FX, Fuzzy, DJ Gengis, Rough, Giordy Beatz, Meme, DJ Sine, Marco Tozzi and Low Killa. The main album released by the collective is Ministero dell&#x27;Inferno. The genres touched by the group range from Gangsta rap to Hardcore hip hop to Rap metal.

===2010s===

Since 2010, after the success of the single &quot;Tranne te&quot; by Fabri Fibra, a real phenomenon of the mainstream rapper is created. Artists such as Emis Killa, Clementino, Fedez, Gemitaiz, MadMan, Rocco Hunt, Baby K, and Salmo make their debut in Italian hip hop. 

At the same time artists are born who manage to bring their music to high levels of sale, examples of these artists are Noyz Narcos and Nitro. Around 2015, the trap influence arrives in Italy starting from albums like &quot;Santeria&quot; by Gué Pequeno and Marracash, &quot;XDVR&quot; and &quot;Sfera Ebbasta&quot; by Sfera Ebbasta, &quot;23 6451&quot; by tha Supreme and &quot;The Dark Album&quot; by the Dark Polo Gang. 

It is followed by new artists such as Achille Lauro, Capo Plaza, Izi, Ghali, Ketama126, Massimo Pericolo, Ernia, tha Supreme and many others. Although, the underground remains firm with artists such as Jack the Smoker, Lord Madness, Murubutu, Claver Gold, Primo Brown (died in 2016), DJ Fastcut, Suarez, Leslie, Hard Squat Crew, Inoki, Rancore, Mezzosangue, Lanz Khan, Mattak (Italian-speaking but Swiss), Gionni Gioielli, L&#x27;Elfo, En?gma and many others. 

During the decade, albums that have already become classics of the genre such as &quot;Il ragazzo d&#x27;oro&quot; by Guè Pequeno, &quot;Mea culpa&quot; by Clementino, &quot;The Island Chainsaw massacre&quot; by Salmo, &quot;Il cuore e la fame&quot; by Egreen and &quot;Dead Poets&quot; by DJ FastCut are released. 

===2020s===
Among the artists of the alternative hip hop genre that include En?gma, with the series of albums &quot;Totem&quot;, started with &quot;Totem – Episodio uno&quot;, anticipated by the single &quot;Bomaye&quot;. Other important artists are Madame and Willie Peyote, both present at the 71st edition of the Sanremo Music Festival respectively with the songs &quot;Voce&quot;, produced by Dardust and &quot;Mai dire mai (La locura)&quot;. At the start of 2021, Il Tre released his first album, &quot;Ali&quot;, that debuted on the first place in the FIMI chart just 1 week after its release. Other modern Italian rappers, such as Wado, focus more on issues of immigration and racism in their lyrics, which still affect many Afro-Italian rappers today. 

==Other forms of the hip hop==

===Freestyle===

The first to have practiced freestyle in Italy were Neffa, Danno from Colle der Fomento, El Presidente and Moddi MC from the crew Pooglia Tribe. Clementino is a multiple-time Italian freestyle champion.

===DJing, writing and breakdancing===
From the overseas situation, writing, beatboxing and breakdancing have been &quot;imported&quot;, as well as DJing. DJs include DJ Jad, Don Joe, Shablo, DJ Tayone, DJ Squarta (Cor Veleno), DJ Double S, Deleterio, DJ Nais, DJ Gruff, DJ Shocca, Mr. Phil, DJ 2P, Bassi Maestro, Big Joe and DJ Harsh.

<doc id="53189" wikidata="Q1071969" url="?curid=53189" title="GNU Bison">
<text>GNU Bison, commonly known as Bison, is a parser generator that is part of the GNU Project. Bison reads a specification in Bison syntax (described as &quot;machine-readable BNF&quot;), warns about any parsing ambiguities, and generates a parser that reads sequences of tokens and decides whether the sequence conforms to the syntax specified by the grammar.

The generated parsers are portable: they do not require any specific compilers. Bison by default generates LALR(1) parsers but it can also generate canonical LR, IELR(1) and GLR parsers.

In POSIX mode, Bison is compatible with Yacc, but also has several extensions over this earlier program, including
* Generation of counterexamples for conflicts
* Location tracking (e.g., file, line, column)
* Rich and internationalizable syntax error messages in the generated parsers
* Customizable syntax error generation,
* Reentrant parsers
* Push parsers, with autocompletion
* Support for named references
* Several types of reports (graphical, XML) on the generated parser
* Support for several programming languages (C, C++, D, or Java)

Flex, an automatic lexical analyser, is often used with Bison, to tokenise input data and provide Bison with tokens.

Bison was originally written by Robert Corbett in 1985. Later, in 1989, Robert Corbett released another parser generator named Berkeley Yacc. Bison was made Yacc-compatible by Richard Stallman.

Bison is free software and is available under the GNU General Public License, with an exception (discussed below) allowing its generated code to be used without triggering the copyleft requirements of the licence.

==Features==
===Counterexample generation===
One delicate issue with LR parser generators is the resolution of conflicts (shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts). With many LR parser generators, resolving conflicts requires the analysis of the parser automaton, which demands some expertise from the user.

To aid the user in understanding conflicts more intuitively, Bison can instead automatically generate counterexamples. For ambiguous grammars, Bison often can even produce counterexamples that show the grammar is ambiguous.

For instance, on a grammar suffering from the infamous dangling else problem, Bison reports

===Reentrancy===
Reentrancy is a feature which has been added to Bison and does not exist in Yacc.

Normally, Bison generates a parser which is not reentrant. In order to achieve reentrancy the declaration codice_1 must be used. More details on Bison reentrancy can be found in the Bison manual.

===Output languages===
Bison can generate code for C, C++, D and Java.

For using the Bison-generated parser from other languages a language binding tool such as SWIG can be used.

==License and distribution of generated code==
Because Bison generates source code that in turn gets added to the source code of other software projects, it raises some simple but interesting copyright questions.

===A GPL-compatible license is not required===
The code generated by Bison includes significant amounts of code from the Bison project itself. The Bison package is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) but an exception has been added so that the GPL does not apply to output.

Earlier releases of Bison stipulated that parts of its output were also licensed under the GPL, due to the inclusion of the yyparse() function from the original source code in the output.

===Distribution of packages using Bison===
Free software projects that use Bison may have a choice of whether to distribute the source code which their project feeds into Bison, or the resulting C code made output by Bison. Both are sufficient for a recipient to be able to compile the project source code. However, distributing only the input carries the minor inconvenience that the recipients must have a compatible copy of Bison installed so that they can generate the necessary C code when compiling the project. And distributing only the C code in output, creates the problem of making it very difficult for the recipients to modify the parser since this code was written neither &quot;by&quot; a human nor &quot;for&quot; humans - its purpose is to be fed directly into a C compiler.

These problems can be avoided by distributing both the input files and the generated code. Most people will compile using the generated code, no different from any other software package, but anyone who wants to modify the parser component can modify the input files first and re-generate the generated files before compiling. Projects distributing both usually do not have the generated files in their version control systems. The files are only generated when making a release.

Some licenses, such as the GPL, require that the source code be in &quot;the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it&quot;. GPL&#x27;d projects using Bison must thus distribute the files which are the input for Bison. Of course, they can also include the generated files.

==Use==
Because Bison was written as a replacement for Yacc, and is largely compatible, the code from a lot of projects using Bison could equally be fed into Yacc. This makes it difficult to determine if a project &quot;uses&quot; Bison-specific source code or not. In many cases, the &quot;use&quot; of Bison could be trivially replaced by the equivalent use of Yacc or one of its other derivatives.

Bison has features not found in Yacc, so some projects can be truly said to &quot;use&quot; Bison, since Yacc would not suffice.

The following list is of projects which are known to &quot;use&quot; Bison in the looser sense, that they use free software development tools and distribute code which is intended to be fed into Bison or a Bison-compatible package.

* Bash shell uses a yacc grammar for parsing the command input.
* Bison&#x27;s own grammar parser is generated by Bison.
* CMake uses several Bison grammars.
* GCC started out using Bison, but switched to a hand-written recursive-descent parser for C++ in 2004 (version 3.4), and for C and Objective-C in 2006 (version 4.1)
* The Go programming language (GC) used Bison, but switched to a hand-written scanner and parser in version 1.5.
* LilyPond requires Bison to generate its parser.
* MySQL
* GNU Octave uses a Bison-generated parser.
* Perl 5 uses a Bison-generated parser starting in 5.10.
* The PHP programming language (Zend Parser).
* PostgreSQL
* Ruby MRI, the reference implementation of the Ruby programming language, relies on a Bison grammar.
* syslog-ng uses several Bison grammars assembled together.

==A complete reentrant parser example==
The following example shows how to use Bison and flex to write a simple calculator program (only addition and multiplication) and a program for creating an abstract syntax tree. The next two files provide definition and implementation of the syntax tree functions.

The tokens needed by the Bison parser will be generated using flex.

The names of the tokens are typically neutral: &quot;TOKEN_PLUS&quot; and &quot;TOKEN_STAR&quot;, not &quot;TOKEN_ADD&quot; and &quot;TOKEN_MULTIPLY&quot;. For instance if we were to support the unary &quot;+&quot; (as in &quot;+1&quot;), it would be wrong to name this &quot;+&quot; &quot;TOKEN_ADD&quot;. In a language such as C, &quot;int *ptr&quot; denotes the definition of a pointer, not a product: it would be wrong to name this &quot;*&quot; &quot;TOKEN_MULTIPLY&quot;.

Since the tokens are provided by flex we must provide the means to communicate between the parser and the lexer. The data type used for communication, &quot;YYSTYPE&quot;, is set using Bison &quot;%union&quot; declaration.

Since in this sample we use the reentrant version of both flex and yacc we are forced to provide parameters for the &quot;yylex&quot; function, when called from &quot;yyparse&quot;. This is done through Bison &quot;%lex-param&quot; and &quot;%parse-param&quot; declarations.

<text>German hip hop (locally known as &quot;Deutschrap&quot;, &quot;Deutsch&quot; meaning German) refers to hip hop music produced in Germany. Elements of American hip hop culture, such as graffiti art and breakdancing, diffused into Western Europe in the early 1980s.

==History==

===1980–1990===
Early underground artists included Cora E. and Advanced Chemistry. It was not until the early 1990s that German hip hop entered the mainstream as groups like Die Fantastischen Vier and the Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt gained popularity. German hip hop was heavily influenced by films, leading to a strong emphasis on visual and cultural elements such as graffiti and breakdancing beyond the music itself.

In addition to films, such as Wild Style and Beat Street, American expats and soldiers stationed in Germany facilitated the introduction of hip hop music and culture into German pop culture.

&quot;GLS United&quot; released the first German language hip hop song, &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Deutsch&quot;, in 1980. While the group (consisting of three radio DJs including the later comedian and TV host Thomas Gottschalk) was formed explicitly for the one song, and the song was intended primarily as a parody of Rapper&#x27;s Delight by The Sugarhill Gang, it was none-the-less the first German hip hop group and first German-language hip hop track. Also the punk rock band Die Toten Hosen released one of the first German hip hop songs, Hip Hop Bommi Bop, in 1983, which also was one of the first rap rock crossovers ever. The song, created in collaboration with Fab 5 Freddy, is a parody hip hop version of their song Eisgekühlter Bommerlunder. Nina Hagen also raps in her 1983 single New York / N.Y. &quot;New York New York&quot;, the English version of &quot;New York / N.Y.&quot;, was successful in American dance charts, peaking at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs.

These hip hop movies -&quot;Wild Style&quot; and &quot;Beat Street&quot;- led the younger audiences in Germany to realize that hip hop was much more than just rap music, but was very much a cultural movement in and of itself. Though at the time of the release of the movie, it did not have a great overall impact, once German reunification began in 1990, the hip hop scene began to flourish. As one German remembers on a visit to the US in 1986, things were much different. MTV did not exist in Europe at the time, and the scene was still very much underground. Moreover, there was a lack of European hip hop clubs.

After this initial wave of popularity, hip hop fans were few and far between. However, the fans that did remain would play a role in the resuscitation of the hip hop culture. &quot;The hardcore hip-hop fans that remained after the breakdance craze faded from the media were central to the further development of hip hop in Germany-they supplied much of the personnel for the important rap groups that began to develop in the late 1980s and early &#x27;90s.&quot; &quot;Graffiti and breakdancing came out big but it only lasted for a short period of time. But hip hop survived in the underground.&quot;

American hip hop continued to influence the German scene, influencing emergent acts such as Rock Da Most. Originally most German rappers relied on English language lyrics, a fact which has led some academics and groups of the German public to interpret the emergence of hip hop in German pop culture as &quot;cultural imperialism&quot;: that is to say, as a movement that emulated the culture of the United States at the expense of their native German cultural traditions. The influence of American hip hop artists remains strong even in today&#x27;s German language hip hop scene: music videos rely on similar symbols of power and affluence, such as cars and jewelry.

Many German hip hop artists are of Turkish-German or Arab-German descent, often second- and third-generation German citizens who grew up in comparatively poor or &quot;tough&quot; neighborhoods, which has become an influential hip hop narrative. Identification with their roots in neighborhoods remains an important aspect of the identity of individual rappers and their &quot;crews&quot;.

When not rapping in English, many German rappers employ a dialect of German developed in these communities and which is therefore associated with immigrants and the German &quot;ghetto&quot;. Using this language in their music, some academics have argued, enables them to levy criticism and protest aspects of society and politics that they perceive as having disadvantaged them and their communities.

Die Fantastischen Vier (the Fantastic Four) are another important German hip hop group, who also began to rap in German around the same time as Advanced Chemistry. Die Fantastischen Vier saw English rap in Germany as meaningless loyalty to &quot;surface elements&quot; of U.S. rap, and devoid of any German political or social context. They sought to appropriate hip hop from its foreign framework, and use it to bring a voice to historical and contemporary problems in Germany. The shift of rapping from English into German increased hip hop&#x27;s appeal to the German people, Gastarbeiter (guest workers) included. Growing self-confidence among Germany&#x27;s immigrant population coincided with the use of the German language in German hip hop, and provided them with a vocal outlet in line with the plight of poor African Americans, out of which hip hop had originally emerged.

The Group &quot;Advanced Chemistry&quot; originated from Heidelberg, Germany. As they were one of the few early hip hop groups to rap in English, they were extremely influential in promoting the hip hop scene in Germany. More importantly, however, &quot;Advanced Chemistry&quot; was a prominent hip hop group, because of the ethnic diversity of the members. Torch, the leader of the group for instance is both of a Haitian and German ethnic background. &quot;Advanced Chemistry&quot; exploded onto the German hip hop scene in November 1992 with their first mixed single entitled &quot;Fremd im eigenen Land&quot; (Foreign in Your Own Country). This song was immensely popular because it directly addressed the issue of immigrants in Germany: &quot;In the video of the song, a band member brandishes a German passport in a symbolic challenge to traditional assumptions about what it means to be German. If the passport is not enough, the video implies, then what is required? German Blood?&quot;.

After the reunification of Germany in 1990, many Germans saw a growing wave of racism. Because many hip hop artists were children of immigrants, this became a major theme of German hip hop.

During the 1980s Germany first saw a wave of second generation immigrants coming into the country. Immigration became a big issue in hip hop albums at this point. The German synonym for an immigrant is Gastarbeiter, which means &quot;guest worker&quot;, and these &quot;guest workers&quot; were rapped about often. Immigrant teenagers commonly use rap and hip hop as a way to defend themselves in their new countries. &quot;Since honour cannot be gained, but only lost, a permanent readiness to fight is required. Thus social approval is acquired by actually defending one&#x27;s honour or by exhibiting abilities such as the willingness to face physical encounter, talkativeness and humour... According to the rules of the game, the first one to whom nothing clever comes to the mind is the loser. This concept is quite similar to &#x27;dissing&#x27; in rap.&quot;

===1990–1995===
In 1991, the German music label &quot;Bombastic&quot; released the record Krauts with Attitude: German Hip Hop Vol. 1. The album featured fifteen songs – three in German, eleven in English, and one in French. The album was produced by DJ Michael Reinboth, a popular hip hop DJ at that time. Michael Reinboth moved to Munich in 1982 and was the first DJ to introduce Garage House and Old school hip hop music to the Munich club scene. His compilation &quot;Krauts with Attitude&quot; is considered one of the first German hip hop albums, as it features Die Fantastischen Vier. The title refers to N.W.A (Niggaz with Attitude), one of the most controversial hip hop groups of the time in the United States. &quot;Krauts with Attitude&quot; was the first album to nationalize German hip hop, and its album packaging reflected this. &quot;The cover was designed in the colours of the national flag (black, red and yellow), and the liner notes read as follows: &#x27;Now is the time to oppose somehow the self confidence of the English and the American.&#x27;&quot; 

In the early 1990s, hip hop established itself in the mainstream, and many new rappers emerged on the scene. One such band was Die Fantastischen Vier, four rappers from Stuttgart, whose optimistic sound and lighthearted lyrics have brought them fame both in Germany and abroad. Apparently, original crew members Smudo and Thomas D, were inspired to begin rapping in German following a six-month visit to the United States. It became apparent that they had nothing in common with U.S. rappers and their essentially middle-class upbringing was foreign to that of the cultural environment of U.S. hip hop. &quot;The group subsequently decided to concentrate on issues they saw around them, using their own language, rather than aping American styles.&quot;

Although Die Fantastischen Vier achieved commercial success and helped to pioneer hip hop music in Germany, they were contested for sounding &quot;too American.&quot; The group&#x27;s lack of socially conscious topics and simplistic delivery and material informed the ways in which they were viewed as a trite pop group.

During 1992–93 many acts of protest occurred in the wake of rising anti-immigration sentiment in Germany. Amongst the angst of this period, the content of German hip hop started to become more politicized. Additionally, the language of the music started to reflect a more local voice. The group Advanced Chemistry has been noted as one of the first to incorporate social critiques of growing prejudice and racism in Germany. &quot;…the newly emerging hip hop movement took a clear stance for the minorities and against the marginalisation of immigrants who, as the song said, might be German on paper, but not in real life&quot; In 1992 the group released the single Fremd im eigenen Land. The song dealt with the widespread racism that non-white German citizens faced. In the same year, another rock-hip-hop collaboration emerged. The punk rock band Die Goldenen Zitronen, together with the US-American rapper Eric IQ Gray and the hip-hop group &quot;Easy Business&quot;, released the maxi-single &quot;80 000 000 Hooligans&quot;, which includes a rap version of their song &quot;80 Million Hooligans&quot;. The song addressed the nationalism and hatred against foreigners that emerged in Germany after the reunification.

During the inception of hip hop into Germany, most popular hip hop artists have come from West Germany. This could be because of the large immigrant population there at the time. &quot;By 1994, the number of immigrants living in Germany had reached 6.9 million. 97 per cent of all immigrants were resident in the western part of the country, which meant that in the former Federal Republic of Germany and in West Berlin every tenth citizen was a foreigner.&quot; Of those 97% of immigrants in the Western part of Germany over 1.5 million of them originated from a European country. For example, the community with the largest number of immigrants (roughly 1.9 million people) was the Turkish community. Within the Turkish community only 5% of its people were of age 60 or older. Such statistics give justification for why hip hop may have flourished in Germany; many of the people were young. Furthermore, German hip hop, much like many other countries, was heavily influenced by the western world. During that time, a rises of anti-immigrant feelings resulted in the acts of arson and murder against the Turkish asylum seekers. In May 1993, 5 Turkish people were killed and many injured when someone attacked the home of a Turkish family with a firebomb. In 1993 German hip hop &quot;globalized&quot; with the emergence of &quot;Viva&#x27;s Freestyle&quot;; the equivalent to the American Yo! MTV Raps show. &quot;Viva&#x27;s freestyle&quot; consisted of hip hop songs from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. The influx of immigrants into Germany caused an adverse effect on employment and wages. It was found that immigrants and native Germans were imperfect substitutes for each other, while old and new immigrants were interchangeable exposing an inelastic labor market.

In the mid-1990s German hip hop was growing. John Clarke used the term &#x27;recontextualization&#x27; to describe the process of borrowing cultural ideas and integrating them into a new society. German hip hop did just this as it took US hip-hop and gave it a new meaning and identity in German culture. Black American gangsta rap, however, is not the only type of rap that has developed in Germany. Some of the most innovative rap music in Germany is made by Germans or by underground crews dedicated to rap for both political and artistic reasons. Rap has been able to succeed in Germany not just due to a different national culture of the U.S., but also because people are responding to other racial and ethnic cultures.
At this time, in the mid-1990s, the relation of import and domestic rap was 70% import to 30% domestic, but domestic was increasing rapidly. CD&#x27;s had practically taken over the market in Germany and cassettes were almost out and were just used for black copies. German hip hop was yet to have a specific identity as different styles occurred due to ethnic and musical background.

===1995–2000===
This was also a time that a lot of immigrants were moving to Germany and they all came with their own culture which contrasted with or added to that of Germany.

Karakan also emerged in the German hip hop scene. In 1991, Alper Aga &amp; Kabus Kerim formed the group in Nuremberg, Germany. This year, they released the first-ever Turkish language rap track in, named &quot;Bir Yabancının Hayatı&quot; (Life of a Foreigner). Two years later, they released classic tracks like &quot;Cehenneme Hoşgeldin&quot; (Welcome to Hell) and the controversial &quot;Defol Dazlak&quot; (Begone Skinhead), which was released as a Maxi Single. &quot;Big Porno Ahmet&quot; joined the group as a producer/beatmaker. Shortly, the success of Karakan spread beyond the borders of Germany and the group started to get well known within the European hip hop scene. During jams, they met Cinai Sebeke (Da Crime Posse) and Erci-E. Together, they established the legendary group CARTEL and released a compilation album in 1995. In 1997, KARAKAN finally released his first official album &quot;Al Sana Karakan&quot; and shot 2 videos, which marked a high point in Turkish hip hop.

The multilingual and multinational group TCA- The Microphone Mafia is an example of &#x27;Oriental Hip Hop in the German Diaspora&#x27;. They combine Spanish, Italian, Turkish and German raps with live music and samples of traditional music from all the previously named countries.

===2000 to present===

In October 2006, what is thought to be the first US-released commercial compilation of German hip hop (and reggae), &quot;Big Up Berlin,&quot; was released in the US. It received 4.5 of 5 stars in All Music Guide (now known as All Music) and featured artists such as Bushido, Fler, Kool Savas, Azad and others.

Today, the German hip hop scene is a reflection of the many dimensions that Germany has come to represent in a unified image of Europe. Everything from &quot;migrant hip hop,&quot; which is known as hip hop from the large Turkish immigrant population, to the more humour-based groups paint a portrait of a vibrant and diverse hip hop community in Germany.

Despite common notions of the Old School German hip hop&#x27;s emulation of US hip hop styles and the New School&#x27;s attempt to rap about crime and violence, some &quot;Old Schoolers&quot; feel that the New School has, in fact, forgotten about its roots. Old School supporters and Scholars disagree on the nature of the recent transformation in German hip hop. Scholars have argued that the Old School German hip hop &quot;scene was musically and vocally oriented to American role models. Rhymes were written in English; funk and soul samples dominated musical structures&quot;. However, Old Schoolers themselves contend that it is the New School German rap artists who have been &quot;Americanized,&quot; and therefore lack the authenticity of the struggle of the ghetto in West Germany. The German old school acknowledged that there were many differences between the situation in the United States and the situation in Germany, and aimed at expressing the concept of &quot;realness,&quot; meaning to &quot;be true to oneself&quot;. Different from the US hip hop&#x27;s equating &quot;realness&quot; with a tougher &quot;street credibility,&quot; many raps that came out of the old school German hip hop &quot;address this issue and reject unreflected imitation of US hip hop as clichés and as the betrayal of the concept of realness&quot;. Furthermore, the Old School of German hip hop may have been seen as representing &quot;a critique of White America&quot; because of its modeling after US hip hop; however, Old schoolers dispute that hip hop in Germany was about the oppression of people in Germany. One Old School artist, DJ Cutfaster lamented that, &quot;Most people have forgotten that hip hop functions as a mouthpiece against violence and oppression and ultimately against the ghetto, which has become the metaphor for the deplorable state of our world&quot;. Contrary to the New School hip hop&#x27;s attempts to crossover into the mainstream popular culture, the Old School &quot;envisioned and propagated hip hop as an underground community that needed to keep its distance from and to create resistance to mainstream culture in order to avoid co-optation&quot;.

<text>The Swiss hip hop culture began in the early 1980s.

== Beginnings ==

=== Crews ===
The most known, active dancers and crews were:
* Fantastic Rockers from Zürich: Power, Fast5, Prince Crime, Chase, Sky
* Battle Rockers (formerly known as &quot;Back Street Crew&quot;) from Zürich: Charly, Duster, Csizee, Spinkie, Steve
* City Rockers (’83–’84) from Bern: Zed &amp; Ice (later joined Jazzy Rockers), Silvano, Mike, J.K., Scholl, Tweety
* Jam Power (ca. ’82–’83) from Geneva: Pascal, Punchy, Fred, Jose, Emilio (a.k.a. Joe B &amp; DJ Mil of rap crew &quot;Duty Free&quot;)
* Supreme Rockers from Lausanne: Speedy &amp; Carlos (rap group &quot;Sens Unik&quot;), Oswaldo, Nino, JP
* Jazzy Rockers from Biel/Bienne: Seyo, Eduzy, Kid Rock, Rubber Band, Dee, Chico Rock, Zed, Soul, (around ’86 Carlos a.k.a. Risk Leader of the African Posse, Shy One, Lee joined)
* Basel City Breakers from Basel: Melo, N-Top, Steve, Ricki, Oli, Willi &amp; others

(Of course there were also others who played a significant role along with those above.)

These crews were the Swiss hip hop founders and brought the hip hop culture fundamentals (Peace, love &amp; unity state of mind, graffiti, breakdance, DJing, MCs) and clothing styles straight from the roots and basic founders in New York City (Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa &amp; The Zulu Nation, Fab 5 Freddy, Grandmaster Flash, The Rock Steady Crew, The New York City Breakers and many other U.S. hip hop masters…). They led the hip hop culture in Switzerland until the end of the 1980s and even after.

Although some of them returned to anonymity since then or died young, the most of these &quot;old schoolers&quot; are still around, watching what&#x27;s going on. Some of them are still taking part of actual hip hop events and others are even still active (like Seyo in Painting Art, others are dealing with music industry in different music styles) and living this culture yet mostly in their heart with a nostalgic state of mind.

=== Rap ===
Early Swiss German rappers started rapping in English, but after the bilingual track &quot;Murder by Dialect&quot; by P-27 featuring Black Tiger, rappers switched to their native Swiss German dialects. Rappers from the French-speaking part (where the traditional dialects died out in most parts) and from the Italian-speaking part (where most people mix dialects and Standard Italian freely) rap in the standard languages.

The issue of language choice has become a major influence in the Swiss hip hop scene: As author Pascale Hofmeier notes, the creation of &quot;Mundartrap&quot; (dialect rap) has enabled Switzerland to develop a unique scene that, due to the lingual choice, is immediately identifiable as a distinctly Swiss product. The importance of language in Swiss hip hop can also create tension, however: Although the members of the Italian-speaking group Stoffunita live in Switzerland and consider it their home, their choice of language combined with their lack of Swiss citizenship earmark them as &quot;Secondo&quot;, a term used to indicate people of foreign descent born in Switzerland. Given Switzerland&#x27;s particularly strong opinions on who is &quot;Swiss&quot; and who is &quot;other&quot;, it is easy to see that groups such as Stoffunita make use of the fact that hip hop &quot;is still considered a voice for the oppressed&quot; as hip hop scholar and author Jeff Chang notes.

The European Music Office&#x27;s report on &quot;Music in Europe&quot; claimed that Switzerland&#x27;s hip hop scene is &quot;particularly innovative and advanced&quot;, featuring Unik Records (the first European indie rap label).

<doc id="53194" wikidata="Q12876996" url="?curid=53194" title="Greek hip-hop">
<text>Greek hip hop (, ), is the chief genre of rap music in Greece.

==History==
The earliest indications of the localized genre date back to 1987 the Maxi-single Deejays&#x27;s with the group FF.C, though native language albums did not appear until the mid-1990s. The first hip hop album was &quot;Diamartiria&quot; (protest) in 1993 of Active Member along with &quot;Σκληροί καιροί&quot; (Hard Times) by FF.C. Both albums released under the independent label &quot;Freestyle Productions&quot;. Though many can argue that the album Modern Fears &quot;Η Αναμέτρηση&quot; (circa 1992) by Aris Thomas was the first hip hop influenced record in Greece. Then Razastarr followed with their unreleased demo on Freestyle Productions, and TXC (now Artemis/Efthimis) with their single &quot;Terror X Crew&quot; in 1995.

Gangsta rap came to Greece in 1997 with the group Zontanoi Nekroi (Ζωντανοί Νεκροί; &quot;Living Dead&quot;). In 1999 the group Paremvoles (Παρεμβολές) released the first hardcore CD named &quot;En Opsi&quot; (Εν όψει; &quot;In consideration of&quot;). In 2000 the group Alfa Gama (Άλφα Γάμα [Α.Γ.]) continued with the CD named &quot;Agnostofovia&quot; (Αγνωστοφοβία; &quot;Fear of the unknown&quot;). Imiskoumbria and Goin&#x27; Through made Greek hip-hop famous in the mainstream Greek audience. Goin&#x27; Through changed their way of music from hip hop to a kind of R&amp;B or Pop music. The political issues and the society also invaded to this type of music. Terror X Crew introduced a new style of rapping with their CDs &quot;I Polis Ealo&quot; (1997) and &quot;Essetai Imar&quot; (2001). These &quot;ethnocentric&quot; albums signified the first time Greek nationalism was involved with hip-hop music. In 2001 Makis Voridis, the then president of the Hellenic Front, awarded the band for its service to contemporary Greek music.

Nowadays Greek hip hop covers a broad spectrum, all the way from hardcore hip hop to urban pop.

<text>Turkish hip hop refers to hip hop music produced by members of the Turkish minority in Germany, and to a lesser degree by hip hop artists in Turkey. The Turkish minority, called the Turks, first drew inspiration from the discrimination and racism they received while living as migrant workers in Germany in the 1960s. Turkish hip hop uses Arabesk music, a folk style that finds its roots in Turkey during the 1960s, and is influenced by the hip hop music of America and Germany. Album artwork, lyrical content, and the Turkish language are used by hip hop artists to express their uniquely Turkish identity.

The first Turkish hip hop album was recorded by the Nuremberg, Germany group King Size Terror in 1991. Islamic Force (now known as KanAK) is often recognized as the beginning of Turkish hip hop. Turkish hip hop is still used as an outlet for many who feel marginalized as Turks living in German society.

==History==
Before Turkish hip hop took hold in Turkey, specifically Istanbul and Ankara, it originally grew out of Turkish ethnic enclaves in Germany. Owing its large population to the Turkish migrants that came to Germany in the 1960s as Gastarbeiter (guest-workers), 2/3 of all Turks in Germany are under the age of 35 and half are under 25. Exclusionary practices on behalf of the government, particularly in terms of citizenship status, create systematic discrimination of Turks in Germany that fuels racism against migrant workers. Although born in Germany, the children of these Gastarbeiters are not recognized as citizens by Germany or their parents&#x27; country of origin. Often living in dilapidated neighborhoods and marked as outsiders by their &quot;eastern&quot; traditions and poor command of the German language, Turkish urban youth gravitate towards hip hop as means of expressive identity construction. From the first rap vinyl recorded in the Turkish language—‘Bir Yabancının Hayatı’ (The Life of a Foreigner) by King Size Terror—to the creation of an entire subgenre—Oriental hip hop—Turkish youth in Germany have embraced and moved beyond pure imitation of African American hip-hop culture. Localizing hip hop, Turks in Germany have reworked it to “act as a mode of expression for a range of local issues” particularly those related racism and the problem of national identity experienced by younger members of ethnic minority groups.

Turkish hip-hop had risen to prominence in Germany with the success and popularity of the Turkish rap group Cartel in the mid 1995s throughout Turkey. After the success of their first album, the members of Cartel had a fight almost killing some of their members. The group was forbidden to perform together again and the members of Cartel were jailed. Cartel&#x27;s album was banned from the music market.

==Turkish Migration to Germany==
After being recruited by the German government to fill the labor shortages in specific industries, Turkish migrants relocated to German cities such as Berlin and Frankfurt under the ‘myth of return’. The first generation of migrants came to Berlin as individual workers and then slowly brought their families over. Gastarbeiters, by nature of the very word (translated as ‘guest worker&#x27;), expected to return to their homeland and did not identify with Germany. This mentality combined with government exclusionary practices caused many Turks to feel alienated and displaced; they maintained an outsider position in society. Whereas the German government could recruit temporary guest workers, they could also be controlled and sent away as the interest of capital dictated. Turks in Germany, excluded because of German policies regarding citizenship, rallied around ethnic lines as a political strategy.

Because of poor integration policies in Germany, Turkish immigrants isolated themselves in ethnic enclaves away from the dominant society and created their own vibrant communities. After Germany passed a law in 1983 to pay foreigners to leave the country, Turks set up their own services to mediate between individuals and the government, creating institutionalized space. Discrimination in Western Europe forced immigrants to constitute their own communities and to define their group boundaries in cultural terms. Children of migrants who were born in Germany and grew up in these ethnic enclaves carry the norms and traditions of their parents&#x27; culture and the dominant society. Kreuzberg, a densely populated area in Berlin with a history of hosting guest workers, is dubbed ‘Kleines Istanbul’ or ‘Little Istanbul.’ Reminiscent of the atmosphere in Istanbul, Kreuzberg is full of local Turkish businesses, open Turkish markets, travel agencies offering regular flights to Turkey, and a Turkish language library. Turks in Germany maintain strong connections to their homeland while constructing local Turkish networks through the conduits of globalization; Turkish language mass media is salient in Berlin.

==Influences==
Before Turkish hip hop took root in Germany, it was influenced by American and German hip hop. Whereas German hip hop gained widespread appeal throughout the early 1995s, it wasn&#x27;t until Advance Chemistry&#x27;s single “Fremd im eigenen Land” (“Strangers in Our Own Land”) that plight of the immigrant was addressed. For Turkish youth who didn&#x27;t identify with Germany as a homeland, localized German hip hop still did not appeal to them nor function as a medium of self-expression. Looking for representation of their own heritage, Turkish artists and producers used German hip hop as a springboard to create Turkish inspired rap lyrics and beats. In an interview with Andy Bennet one Turkish-German label owner put it: “Well, from a musical point of view we’re trying to combine traditional Turkish melodies and rhythms with rap. The kids have been doing it for a while… you can buy tapes of Turkish music from Turkish stores around the city and they’ve been experimenting with that music, sampling it, mixing it with other stuff and rapping to it… We’re just trying to build on the Turkish rap thing and build an outlet for it… If I’m going to tell you why we’re doing it, well, it’s pride really. The point about a lot of this German rap it’s all about coloured guys saying look at us, we’re like you, we’re German. But I don’t feel like that I never have. I’m not German, I’m a Turk and I’m passionately proud of it”.

==Language==
The most obvious demarcation of Turkish hip hop in Germany is language. As Bennet writes, “the fact of language itself can also play a crucial role in informing the way in which song lyrics are heard and the forms of significance which are read into them”. First and foremost, Turkish rap distinguishes itself from German and American hip hop by the utilizing the Turkish language rather than German or English. Feridun Zaimoglu, one of Germany’s leading literary figures, describes the Turkish most hip hop artists employ as ‘Kanak Sprak.’ ‘Kanak Sprak’ makes a direct reference to local racism in Germany This creolized Turkish-German spoken by the disenfranchised youth of the hip-hop generation is characterized as sentences without commas, full stops, capital letters, and any kind of punctuation as well as frequent switches between Turkish and German Kanak Sprak alone, without even delving into the lyrics, sets Turkish hip hop apart from pure imitation of American music and makes it more meaningful for its Turkish listeners. For example, when Cartel—the original Turkish-language rap project to get off the ground—released their debut album to address the first generation of Turkish immigrants in Berlin, it sparked an international controversy. Although some refrains were rapped in German, most of the lyrics as well as promotional materials and paraphernalia were in Turkish. Cartel even reclaimed the word ‘Kanak’ from its derogative roots by using it liberally in their album, “Don’t be ashamed, be proud to be a Kanak!” and branding it all over their T-shirts and stickers. This not only marked hip-hop culture as distinctly Turkish, but simultaneously created a separate public sphere for fans of Turkish hip hop because most Germans did not speak Turkish. The very fact that the language of the album was in Turkish shifted the balance of power from privileged Germans to oppressed Turks. In the liner notes of the cd, “the English words ‘What are they sayin?!’ appear in big bubble letters. Underneath, the caption teasingly reads in German: ‘Didn’t pay attention in Turkish class? Then ask for the translations fast with this card’”.

==Aesthetics and Local Significance==
In addition to rapping in the language of their ancestral homeland, Turkish hip hop is aesthetically different from German hip hop. Primarily, Turkish hip-hop artists choose to sample Arabesk music in their songs drawing upon a mythic Turkish past. Arabesk is folk music style that originally appeared in Turkey during the 1960s as a reflection of migrant workers first experience of immigration inside the homeland As Brown writes, “With its bittersweet longing for a homeland left behind—a homeland most Turkish-German youngsters could never have seen expect perhaps on vacation—Arabesk expresses a nostalgia and cultural pessimism that dovetails perfectly with hip hop’s invention of community through stories of displacement” (Brown, 144). In describing Turkish music, Mc Boe-B from Islamic Force tells the narrative, “boy comes home and listens to hip hop, then his father comes along and says ‘come on boy, we’re going shopping.’ They get in the car and the boy listens to Turkish music on the cassette player. Later, he gets our record and listens to both styles in one” 

Furthermore, album artwork and lyrical content enable hip-hoppers and fans to identify commercially and express individually their Turkish identity. In order to see a comprehensive picture of the cultural groundwork Turkish hip hop accomplishes, it&#x27;s important too take a closer look at the origins of the movement as well as specific examples of local artists. Oriental hip hop owes much of its origins to hip-hop groups that were briefly mentioned earlier: Islamic Force and Cartel. Islamic Force (now KanAK) was founded in the 1980s as a way to give ethnic minorities in Germany a voice and is often recognized as the spark that started Oriental hip hop. Along with hip-hop artists DJ Derezon, the group released their first single, “My Melody/Istanbul in 1995 to fight racism towards Turks in Germany by combining Western and Turkish cultures (Hip-Hop Culture). By rapping in English and mixing African-American hip-hop beats with Turkish Arabesk, Islamic Force is a perfect example of Boe-B’s kid who listens to both Turkish and American cassettes in his father’s car. Although they initially focused on American hip hop by rapping in English to gain Western acceptance, an increase in the groups popularity in Turkey led them to eventually switch to rapping in Turkish. By rapping in their native language, Islamic Force connected directly with Turkey as a country as well as their cultural background while simultaneously merging a global genre (hip hop) with a local culture (Turkish traditions) According to Diessel, “The synthesis of Turkish musical idioms and language with hip hop was successful in appealing to a young audience. For Turkish youth in Germany, Oriental hip hop is at once profoundly local and simultaneously global; it imagines, through the evocation of the far reaching ‘Orient’ and the cohesive language of hip hop, multiple possibilities of resistance to the politics of exclusion” 

==Common Themes==
The first rap vinyl to be recorded in the Turkish language was &#x27;Bir Yabancının Hayatı&#x27; (&#x27;The Life of a Foreigner&#x27;), by the Nuremberg, Germany crew King Size Terror. As the title of this track suggests, immigration of Turks around the world, especially Germany, was difficult to cope with. This was due to the almost 2 million Turks in Germany, half of whom were between the ages of 25 and 45. As a result of the fall of the Berlin Wall in the early 1995s a refreshed form of nationalism paved the way for a new youth culture- hip hop. Since Turks felt very marginalized by German society, they turned to hip hop in order to express their concerns. This oriental hip hop allowed Turkish youngsters to discuss what it meant to them to be a German foreigner and how they still identified as being Turkish. In Frankfurt were DJ Mahmut &amp; Murat G. the early starters in Turkish rap, Murat was rapping in both languages German and Turkish, DJ Mahmut delivered the eastern and western sounds. Over the self-founded label Looptown Records they released the first Turkish rap album in 1995 with the compilation Looptown presents Turkish Hip Hop with German-Turkish artists out.

The first solo album DJ Mahmuts and Murat Gs followed only a few years later with Garip Dünya (1997). With this record, the duo toured in 1999 through major cities in Turkey. As a result of this following, groups such as Karakon, an offspring of King Size Terror, reached super stardom as a result of the release of Cartel in Germany in 1995. Cartel was targeted directly to German Turkish youth to be used as a musical lobby for thousands of kids who needed a voice through which they could express the discrimination they have faced in German society. This voice is that of Oriental Hip Hop.

Oriental hip hop is a way for disenfranchised youth to mark their place in German society. They live in Germany, but may feel like outcasts because they do not fit perfectly into the cookie-cutter mold of being only German or only Turkish. Turkish hip-hop has allowed the youth to embrace their identity and let others know that although some may see them as exiles in Germany, the youth take pride in themselves, their community, and their heritage. In fact, it even incorporates an element of &quot;rebellion&quot; towards the discrimination Turks face in German society, and hip-hop is united with other cultural expressions in this regard. For instance, popular German author Feridun Zaimoglu adopts a hip-hop friendly hybridization of German and Turkish in his book &quot;Kanak Sprak&quot;, that allows German Turks to reclaim a pejorative term. This disenfranchised group, defined by one scholar as &quot;hyphenated German citizens,&quot; is drawn to hip-hop as a form of expression because its members have been denied representation and recognition by the majority. In &quot;The Vinyl Ain&#x27;t Final* Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture&quot;, ed . by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, they quote &quot;Advanced chemistry thus represents not a rejection of the idea of &#x27;Germanness&#x27;, but a vision of multicultural type of &#x27;Germanness&#x27;. Hip hop is important not just because it is art, but because it is a weapon against racial chauvinism and ethnic nationalism. But nationalism is not absent from the German rap scene; on the contrary, there is an implicit (and sometimes explicit) conflict over national identity that finds expression, on the one hand, in charges that the attempt to form a &#x27;German&#x27; rap culture is inherently exclusionary, and on the other, in the growth of a counter-nationalism in the form of ethnic-Turkish or so-called &#x27;Oriental hip hop&#x27;&quot; (142) In &quot;From Krauts with attitudes to Turks with attitudes: some aspects oh hip hop history in Germany&quot;, written by Dietmar Eleflein, &quot;Yet at the same time, the title Krauts with Attitude also played with a kind of non-dissident identification of a part of the West German hip-hop scene with its role models. Here the structural signs of competition could be coded nationally in terms of an integration in an international framework* what started as &#x27;Bronx against Queens&#x27; or &#x27;East Coast against West Coast&#x27; gradually turned into &#x27;FRG against USA&#x27;. Further, Niggaz with Attitude themselves, together with performers like Ice Cube and Dre Dre, initiated the &#x27;gangsta hip-hop&#x27;, a subgenre which was especially popular in those parts of the Western German scene in which identification with this youth culture bordered on glorification&quot; (258) .

Oriental hip hop was the product of two innovations, having to do with the Turkish language and the choice of material which started with King Size Terror’s ‘The Life of the Stranger. This art created a new and more useful identity for the Turkish population in Germany. Oriental hip hop represented the second and third generation Turks that rebelled against the policy in Germany; Turkish individuals were discriminated against because of their race. Turkish youth have adopted hip hop as a form of musical expression, commentary, and protest.

A distinctive trait of Turkish rap is the fact that languages other than English and German are used. Rapping in Turkish tongue has had its benefits and its costs. On a positive note, making music with Turkish lyrics helped rappers make their music more personal. It also allowed these artists to localize what was considered to be a foreign U.S. musical commodity into an artistic form that represented their people, situations, and causes. On the negative side of this, some felt that rapping in a language other than English or German further isolated these artists in the German music scene and placed labels on them. As one member of the Turkish rap group Cartel notes, “Rapping consistently in Turkish was not necessarily a choice but rather the result of being defined by mainstream culture as different, more precisely defined within the framework of Orientalist discourse as the exoticized other and marketed as such.&quot; However, Turkish hip-hop can be seen as truly ground-breaking due to the music its artists elect to sample in songs. Instead of simply using clips from American rap songs in their music, Turkish rappers decided to further localize the music and put culturally relevant Turkish samples in songs. As Brown writes, “The central musical innovation in ‘Oriental hip-hop’ – the rejection of African American samples in favor of samples drawn from Turkish &quot;Arabesk&quot; a pop – is emblematic of the blending of diasporic Black culture and diasporic Turkish culture.&quot;

==Diasporic community==
In embracing these Turkish traditions, accessible to them from their parents as well as familial ties to Turkey, Turkish youth in Berlin are influenced by a culture not tied one hundred percent to their current geographical location. Through ‘imaginary’ journeys back to the homeland—whether it&#x27;s reminiscing about vacations to Istanbul or public discourse about Turkey—Turkish-German youth construct their local identities from global places. In addition to the physical transmission of hip-hop cassettes to Germany, globalization enables a transnational movement as well as identity by connecting alienated youth to their ethnic roots. Modern circuitry connects youth not only to the rest of the world, but also to the ‘homeland’. This transcendence of physical borders is exemplified in Turkish hip hop. Azize-A, born in Berlin to a Turkish family, released her first hip-hop album called, Es ist Zeit (It&#x27;s time) in 1997. Considered the first ‘Turkish hip-hopper lady’ Germany, Azize-A gained popular media attention by addressing issues Turkish women deal with as double-minorities. While her appeal is largely to young girls—Azize-A has often been described as the Turkish Queen Latifah—she also directly addresses issues of national identity. In her song, ‘Bosphorus Bridge,’ this Berlin-Turk rapper attempts to “locate the descendants of Turk migrants in a hybrid space where cultural borders blend, where periphery meets the centre, and where the West merges East (. She raps in Turkish,&quot; We live together on planet earth/And if we want to grow in peace/We need to erase our borders,/Share our rich cultures./Yes, connect and blend the West/ West with the East.&quot; Using a reference to the ‘Bosphorus Bridge’—a bridge in Turkey that connects the European and Asian sides—she calls for Turks in Germany to cross invisible cultural borders. In a similar vein, MC Boe-B expresses his double diasporic identity as well as the quest for his homeland in his song ‘Selamın aleyküm.’ Translated by Ayhan Kaya, Mc Boe-B raps the following lyrics, &quot; They arrive in Istanbul from their villages/ And got searched in the German customs/It is as if they got purchased/Germans thought they’d use and kick them off /But they failed to/Our people ruined their plans/Those peasants turned out to be clever/They worked hard/Opened a bakery or a doner kebab/on each corner/ But they paid a lot for this success&quot; Referring to those who have been twice migrants, these lyrics begin by expressing the hardship guest workers faced when they first arrived in Germany. As the song progresses, Boe-B identifies himself within this context of struggle when he raps, “We are losing life, losing blood/I was chosen to explain these things/Everybody screams ‘Tell us Boe-B’/ And I am telling our story as hip hop in Kadikoy’/...We tell you our experiences/we present you the news/we connect our neighbourhood and Kadikoy/we are doing real hip hop/and we tell it to you/...I am telling this story in a far land, Kadikoy.

In distinguishing themselves from their German counterparts, Turkish hip hop culture in Germany creates a diasporic Turkish community essential to the nature and success of a Turkish youth subculture. In &quot;Global Culture&quot;, Appadurai describes diasporic communities as a type of ethnoscape. He defines ethnoscapes as, “the landscapes of persons who constitute the shifting world in which we live: tourist, immigrants, refugees, guest-workers and other moving groups and persons” Ethnoscapes, “allow us to recognize that our notions of space, place and community have become much more complex, indeed a ‘single community’ may now be dispersed across a variety of sites”. Through hip hop Turkish youth in Germany have done precisely that; they have created a community that transcends one specific geographical location. As demonstrated by popular Turkish hip-hop artists, it is only through the global connection to their homeland, that Turkish youth in Berlin find meaning in their local contexts. Turkish hip hop is a “youth culture that enables ethnic minority youths to use both their own ‘authentic’ cultural capital and the global transcultural capital in constructing and articulating their identities”. By embracing hip-hop culture, Turkish youth reclaim a sense of pride, assert their space in the public sphere, and reaffirm their Turkish heritage. As they rework hip hop to act as a mode of expression for a range of local issues—a common theme in global hip hop—Turkish youth also create a diasporic community. It is only through the creation of this diasporic community that Oriental hip hop moves beyond simple appropriation of African-American and German tradition while performing cultural works at a grassroots level 

==Turkish versus German hip hop==
Although being most prominent in Germany, Turkish hip hop is placed in opposition to German hip hop. Timothy Brown in &quot;‘Keeping it Real’ in a Different ‘Hood: (African-) Americanization and Hip-Hop in Germany&quot;, described Turkish hip hop as the product of a language and source material innovation. According to an article about German hip hop in The Bomb Hip-Hop Magazine, Germany is full of immigrants, and consequently, everyone raps in the language they prefer. Turkish hip hop artists rap in their own Turkish language and sample Turkish folk music as opposed to American or German songs. This musical subgenre is therefore seen as a counter nationalism movement marking the Turkish ethnicity within the German nationalism as a whole. It became a weapon against racial chauvinism and ethnic nationalism in Germany.

== Controversies ==
In 2006, the members of Nefret broke up and Dr. Fuchs released the song &quot;Hani Biz Kardeştik (Ceza Diss)&quot; (&quot;I thought we were like brothers&quot;) on his official website. The song claimed that Turkish rapper Ceza had abandoned his team for money and more fame. At the time, Ceza was one of the few rappers played on popular Turkish television stations such as Kral TV. In August, Turkish Rock singer Kıraç explained in an interview that he believed Hip Hop should stay out of Turkish music. He believed that Hip Hop was only brainwashing music and that it took nothing to make a song. He criticized Turkish singers Tarkan and former members of Nefret during his interview and he believed that they should stop trying to make rap music. Ceza responded to this by performing a song about Kıraç which used a lot of explicit content. Kıraç later announced that he planned to sue Ceza in court. Afterwards, Ceza instantly apologized to Kıraç and he said that he will think twice in the future before doing something like this.

In 2007, Turkish rapper Ege Çubukçu released an underground diss single against Ceza titled &quot;Cennet Bekleyebilir&quot; (&quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;). He accused Ceza of stealing beats from American rapper Eminem&#x27;s music. He claimed that Ceza&#x27;s hit song &quot;Sitem&quot; had exactly the same beat as &quot;The Way I Am&quot; by Eminem. The single had little support and airplay.

While Turkish hip hop has been seen to be a form of expression of immigrant youth in areas such as Germany, its authenticity and credibility have been challenged. Artists such as Tarkan, a Turkish pop star, has claimed that &quot;Turkish hip-hop is not original, its something we really are not.&quot; While he also incorporates much western influence and electronic, he believes that pop is the form of music which protects the Turkish essence and that musical genres such as hip hop and rock have only been paid attention to as a result of pop music being overplayed on the radio. The notion of the &quot;underground&quot; is prominent in Turkish hip-hop as it points to the marginalisation and censorship of rap within the music scene in Turkey and also connotes the rappers pursuit for authenticity in their music. 

== In Europe ==

The first Turkish language hip hop record was titled &quot;Bir Yabancının Hayatı&quot; or &quot;The Life of Serkan Danyal Munir Raymondo Tatar&quot;, produced by King Size Terror, a Turkish-German group from Nuremberg, in 1991. Stranger in this context refers to how Turkish youth can feel like strangers to the mainstream German culture. Turkish hip hop continues to influence the hip hop scenes in Western Europe, especially in Germany where many top chart rappers such as Kool Savaş (who has collaborated with 50 Cent, RZA, Jadakiss, &amp; Juelz Santana) Summer Cem and Eko Fresh are of Turkish descent. While Nefret was performing Turkish rap in Turkey and Germany from 1999–2002, another Turkish rap network emerged, however this time from Switzerland with Makale in 1997 with other groups in Europe followed suit like c-it from France who hand a hit single in turkey titled my name. Many Turks came to Germany and UK as immigrants, or what is there referred to as &quot;guest workers&quot;, and created their own enclaves. For example, there are entire neighborhoods in Berlin that are predominantly Turkish, such as Gesundbrunnen and Kreuzberg, in which the influence of Turkish culture as well as the feeling of alienation or isolation from the rest of the city is present.

It is in these settings that hip hop has become an important tool for the German and UK-born children of the Turkish guest workers to express themselves. They used this new form of expression, influenced by American hip hop, to explore and deal with the idea of being &quot;strangers&quot; or &quot;foreigners&quot; even when they had been born German.

<text>Surf lifesaving is a multifaceted social movement that comprises key aspects of voluntary lifeguard services and competitive surf sport. Originating in early 20th century Australia, the movement has expanded globally to other countries, including New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Surf lifesavers in Australia are colloquially known as &quot;Clubbies&quot;.

==History==
Surf lifesaving originated in Australia in 1907 in response to drownings at local beaches in Sydney. Such groups became necessary following the relaxing of laws prohibiting daylight bathing on Australian beaches. Volunteer groups of men were trained in life saving methods and patrolled the beaches as lifesavers looking after public safety.

There had been some debate between Manly Life Saving Club, Bronte Surf Lifesaving Club and Bondi Surf Bathers&#x27; Life Saving Club as to which was formed first. After a panel of SLSA historians reviewed all the documentation provided by each club in 2005, SLSA agreed that they recognise Bondi as the first surf life saving club. They stated “A hardy perennial in surf lifesaving history is the question of the first surf club — Bondi or Bronte. As this study has shown, the first group of organised lifesavers formed on Manly Beach in 1899. While moves on Bondi, Bronte and Manly in early 1907 saw the organisation of irregulars, it was the surf bathers of Bondi who first organised themselves as a formal club in February 1907.” The Bondi Surf Bathers&#x27; Life Saving Club was officially established on 21 February 1907, at the Royal Hotel in Bondi - as was recorded in the newspaper &quot;The East Sydney Argus&quot;, and in the Waverley Council minutes acknowledging receipt of a letter from the newly formed group.

On 10 October 1907, the Surf Bathing Association of New South Wales (SBANSW) was founded with nine clubs and affiliated associations. The nine “foundation” clubs were the Royal Life Saving Society, Manly Surf Club, Bondi Surf Bathers&#x27; Life Saving Club, Coogee Surf Life Brigade (Coogee Surf Life Saving Club), Bronte Surf Brigade (Bronte Surf Lifesaving Club), Bondi Surf and Social Club (North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club), Tamarama Surf Club (later disbanded, however nowadays Tamarama Surf Life Saving Club), Maroubra Surf Club (Maroubra Surf Life Saving Club), United Wanderers Surf Club, and Woollahra Surf Club. The first club outside of Sydney was Kiama Surf Bather&#x27;s Club, founded in 1908.
The first New Zealand Surf Lifesaving Clubs began in the years 1909 to 1910 leading off with: Castlecliff (Wanganui), Lyall Bay (Wellington), New Brighton (Christchurch) and Worser Bay (Wellington). Within the next few years other clubs started forming around five regions: Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Gisborne/Napier/New Plymouth and Wanganui.

In the northern region, Piha Surf Life Saving Club was founded in 1934 and as such is the oldest club on Auckland&#x27;s west coast and is the home of Piha Rescue. Soon after the New Zealand clubs were formed, rivalry began to take place which created the forming of competition between the clubs and regions. By early 1912 competitions were being organised by Wellington&#x27;s Maranui Club, with male members competing in squads of eight. The competitions consisted of a land drill and &#x27;reel test&#x27;. The first New Zealand National Champs where clubs were able to compete was held in 1922.

The Surf Life Saving Great Britain (SLSGB) organisation was formed in 1955. Volunteer clubs patrolled beaches in England at Bude and St. Agnes in Cornwall and at Brighton, their aim to protect, rescue and resuscitate bathers. Voluntary organisations exist in Germany, such as DLRG and Wasserwacht.

==Rescue services==


Lifesavers are volunteers that typically patrol in groups under a patrol captain for a given period of time on weekend and public holidays under a roster system. In order to be a surf lifesaver a person must hold a Bronze Medallion or a Surf Rescue Certificate and pass an annual proficiency test. Lifesavers who are on patrol wear red and yellow cloth caps on the head. While not performing rescues they are also required to wear long-sleeve yellow shirts and red shorts to provide protection against the sun. Support Operations Lifesavers are required to wear the appropriate functional attire. This includes wetsuits for RWC (Rescue Water Craft) drivers, JRB/ORB (jet and offshore rescue boat) crew and high visibility tabards for Duty Officers who liaise with other emergency services at major incidents. The crews of various Lifesaver helicopter services over the country wear appropriate aviation equipment. Each surf life saving club also has a competition cap with distinct colours or patterns. These are worn during competition and for training on the beach. The patrolled area of the beach is marked out with red and yellow flags and beachgoers are encouraged to swim between the flags. Those wishing to use surfcraft are required to remain outside the flags.

In the UK, SLSGB has a long history of voluntary members patrolling local beaches, offering advice, first aid and rescue services. This continues today and is a vital service to the community. Many local authorities provide a lifeguard service from May to September on popular beaches. In some areas Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) Lifeguards operate on behalf of the local authority.

==Competition==
The other key part of surf life saving is the competitive sport which evolved from the training activities of lifesavers at Australian and New Zealand surf beaches, though most events share little with modern inflatable rescue boat (IRB) based surf rescue techniques. The sport is still based on volunteer clubs which perform rescue duty, from children in the &quot;nippers&quot; category through to professional elite circuits that have been established for the high-profile &quot;ironman&quot; events. The sport is still mainly in Australia and New Zealand. However, the Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service in Canada has run the Nova Scotia Surf League competitions every summer since 2000, and competition programs exist in five regions of Canada. In Europe the sport is increasingly developed, with Italy, Spain and Germany particularly strong and the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland developing rapidly.

Surf life saving clubs regularly hold surf carnivals where clubs compete with each other in a range of beach- and rescue-oriented events including combined swimming and running, surf ski and surf boat races. The youth arm of the clubs is known as Nippers, and holds similar events.

The various events involve elements of surf swimming, board riding, sand running, mock rescues using rowed surf boats, and paddling special kayak-like surf skis. Some events are for individuals, but many are team events.

Individual surf lifesaving events include:
*Ironman
*Long boat rescue (also called surf boat rescue)
*R&amp;R (rescue &amp; resuscitation)
*March Past
*Beach events (including beach sprints, beach relays, and beach flags)
*Surf ski
* First aid competition, champion lifesaver and patrol competition
*Board events
*IRB racing

Individual surf life saving clubs compete at the state and national levels at the annual State Championships and Australian Surf Life Saving Championships where around 450 events are run over nine days of competition with over 6,000 competitors from around Australia and internationally.

==Life saving today==

Surf lifesaving in Australia is well-developed as both a voluntary lifesaver service and as a competitive sport. There are 314 surf lifesaving clubs in Australia that collectively patrol over 400 beaches. In the 2003-2004 season there were 24,968 active members (those who are rostered to patrol regularly), of which approximately 40% are women. In the 2003-2004 patrol season, lifesavers performed 9,044 rescues, provided emergency care to 26,739 patients, and undertook 171,965 preventive actions.

Surf life savers provide important surf rescue services on beaches in Australia on weekends and public holidays throughout the patrol season on a volunteer basis. In New South Wales the season coincides with the beginning of the September school holidays and finishes on ANZAC Day. They also provide year-round on-call volunteer rescue services in most areas known as Support Services.

Lifesavers are distinguished in Australia from paid lifeguards which are generally employed by the relevant Local Government authority and patrol the beach throughout the year. Lifeguards also patrol lakes, pools, and other aquatic venues. Support Services also operate to augment the patrols on the beach by providing surveillance away from the flag areas and emergency back-up when required.

<text>Aztec mythology is the body or collection of myths of the Aztec civilization of Central Mexico. The Aztecs were Nahuatl-speaking groups living in central Mexico and much of their mythology is similar to that of other Mesoamerican cultures. According to legend, the various groups who became the Aztecs arrived from the North into the Anahuac valley around Lake Texcoco. The location of this valley and lake of destination is clear – it is the heart of modern Mexico City – but little can be known with certainty about the origin of the Aztec. There are different accounts of their origin. In the myth, the ancestors of the Mexica/Aztec came from a place in the north called Aztlan, the last of seven &quot;nahuatlacas&quot; (Nahuatl-speaking tribes, from &quot;tlaca&quot;, &quot;man&quot;) to make the journey southward, hence their name &quot;Azteca.&quot; Other accounts cite their origin in Chicomoztoc, &quot;the place of the seven caves&quot;, or at Tamoanchan (the legendary origin of all civilizations).

The Mexica/Aztec were said to be guided by their patron war-god Huitzilopochtli, meaning &quot;Left-handed Hummingbird&quot; or &quot;Hummingbird from the South.&quot; At an island in Lake Texcoco, they saw an eagle, perched on a nopal cactus, holding a rattlesnake in its talons. This vision fulfilled a prophecy telling them that they should found their new home on that spot. The Aztecs built their city of Tenochtitlan on that site, building a great artificial island, which today is in the center of Mexico City. This legendary vision is pictured on the Coat of Arms of Mexico.

== Creation myth ==

According to legend, when the Mexica arrived in the Anahuac valley around Lake Texcoco, they were considered by the other groups as the least civilized of all, but the Mexica decided to learn... and they took in all that they could from the other people, especially from the ancient Toltec (whom they seem to have partially confused with the more ancient civilization of Teotihuacan). To the Aztec, the Toltec were the originators of all culture; &quot;Toltecayotl&quot; was a synonym for culture. Aztec legends identify the Toltecs and the cult of Quetzalcoatl with the legendary city of Tollan, which they also identified with the more ancient Teotihuacan.

Because the Aztecs adopted and combined several traditions with their own earlier traditions, they had several creation myths. One of these, the Five Suns, describes four great ages preceding the present world, each of which ended in a catastrophe, and &quot;were named in function of the force or divine element that violently put an end to each one of them&quot;. Coatlicue was the mother of Centzon Huitznahua (&quot;Four Hundred Southerners&quot;), her sons, and Coyolxauhqui, her daughter. At some point, she found a ball of feathers and placed it in her waistband, thus becoming pregnant with Huitzilopochtli. Her other children became suspicious as to the identity of the father, and vowed to kill their mother. She gave birth on Mount Coatepec, pursued by her children, but the newborn Huitzilopochtli (born fully armed and prepared to fight) defeated most of his brothers, who then became the stars. He also killed his half-sister, Coyolxauhqui, by tearing out her heart using Xiuhcoatl (a blue snake) and throwing her body down the mountain. This was said to inspire the Aztecs to rip the hearts out of their human sacrifices and throw their bodies down the sides of the temple dedicated to Huitzilopochtli, who represents the sun, chasing away the stars at dawn.

Our age (&quot;Nahui-Ollin&quot;), the fifth age, or fifth creation, began in the ancient city of Teotihuacan. According to the myth, all the gods had gathered to sacrifice themselves and create a new age. Although the world and the sun had already been created, it would only be through their sacrifice that the sun would be set into motion, and time (as well as history, could begin.) The strongest and most handsome of the gods, Tecuciztecatl, was supposed to sacrifice himself but when it came time to self-immolate, he could not jump into the fire. Instead, Nanahuatl the smallest and humblest of the gods, who was also covered in boils, sacrificed himself first, and jumped into the flames. The sun was set into motion with his sacrifice, and time began. Humiliated by Nanahuatl&#x27;s sacrifice, Tecuciztecatl, too, leaped into the fire and became the moon.

<text>The Aztecs ( ) were a Mesoamerican civilization that flourished in central Mexico in the post-classic period from 1300 to 1521. The Aztec people included different ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to the 16th centuries. Aztec culture was organized into city-states (&quot;altepetl&quot;), some of which joined to form alliances, political confederations, or empires. The Aztec Empire was a confederation of three city-states established in 1427: Tenochtitlan, the capital city of the Mexica or Tenochca, Tetzcoco, and Tlacopan, previously part of the Tepanec empire, whose dominant power was Azcapotzalco. Although the term Aztecs is often narrowly restricted to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan, it is also broadly used to refer to Nahua polities or peoples of central Mexico in the prehispanic era, as well as the Spanish colonial era (1521–1821). The definitions of Aztec and Aztecs have long been the topic of scholarly discussion ever since German scientist Alexander von Humboldt established its common usage in the early 19th century.

Most ethnic groups of central Mexico in the post-classic period shared essential cultural traits of Mesoamerica. So many of the characteristics that characterize Aztec culture cannot be said to be exclusive to the Aztecs. For the same reason, the notion of &quot;Aztec civilization&quot; is best understood as a particular horizon of a general Mesoamerican civilization. The culture of central Mexico includes maize cultivation, the social division between nobility (&quot;pipiltin&quot;) and commoners (&quot;macehualtin&quot;), a pantheon (featuring Tezcatlipoca, Tlaloc, and Quetzalcoatl), and the calendric system of a &quot;xiuhpohualli&quot; of 365 days intercalated with a &quot;tonalpohualli&quot; of 260 days. Particular to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan was the patron god Huitzilopochtli, twin pyramids, and the ceramic styles known as Aztec I to IV.

From the 13th century, the Valley of Mexico was the heart of dense population and the rise of city-states. The Mexica were late-comers to the Valley of Mexico, and founded the city-state of Tenochtitlan on unpromising islets in Lake Texcoco, later becoming the dominant power of the Aztec Triple Alliance or Aztec Empire. It was an empire that expanded its political hegemony far beyond the Valley of Mexico, conquering other city-states throughout Mesoamerica in the late post-classic period. It originated in 1427 as an alliance between the city-states Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan; these allied to defeat the Tepanec state of Azcapotzalco, which had previously dominated the Basin of Mexico. Soon Texcoco and Tlacopan were relegated to junior partnership in the alliance, with Tenochtitlan the dominant power. The empire extended its reach by a combination of trade and military conquest. It was never a true territorial empire controlling territory by large military garrisons in conquered provinces but rather dominated its client city-states primarily by installing friendly rulers in conquered territories, constructing marriage alliances between the ruling dynasties, and extending an imperial ideology to its client city-states. Client city-states paid taxes, not tribute to the Aztec emperor, the &quot;Huey Tlatoani&quot;, in an economic strategy limiting communication and trade between outlying polities, making them dependent on the imperial center for the acquisition of luxury goods. The political clout of the empire reached far south into Mesoamerica conquering polities as far south as Chiapas and Guatemala and spanning Mesoamerica from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans.

The empire reached its maximum extent in 1519, just before the arrival of a small group of Spanish conquistadors led by Hernán Cortés. Cortés allied with city-states opposed to the Mexica, particularly the Nahuatl-speaking Tlaxcalteca as well as other central Mexican polities, including Texcoco, its former ally in the Triple Alliance. After the fall of Tenochtitlan on 13 August 1521 and the capture of the emperor Cuauhtémoc, the Spanish founded Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan. From there, they proceeded with the process of conquest and incorporation of Mesoamerican peoples into the Spanish Empire. With the destruction of the superstructure of the Aztec Empire in 1521, the Spanish used the city-states on which the Aztec Empire had been built to rule the indigenous populations via their local nobles. Those nobles pledged loyalty to the Spanish crown and converted, at least nominally, to Christianity, and, in return, were recognized as nobles by the Spanish crown. Nobles acted as intermediaries to convey taxes and mobilize labor for their new overlords, facilitating the establishment of Spanish colonial rule.

Aztec culture and history are primarily known through archaeological evidence found in excavations such as that of the renowned Templo Mayor in Mexico City; from Indigenous writings; from eyewitness accounts by Spanish conquistadors such as Cortés and Bernal Díaz del Castillo; and especially from 16th- and 17th-century descriptions of Aztec culture and history written by Spanish clergymen and literate Aztecs in the Spanish or Nahuatl language, such as the famous illustrated, bilingual (Spanish and Nahuatl), twelve-volume Florentine Codex created by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún, in collaboration with Indigenous Aztec informants. Important for knowledge of post-conquest Nahuas was the training of indigenous scribes to write alphabetic texts in Nahuatl, mainly for local purposes under Spanish colonial rule. At its height, Aztec culture had rich and complex philosophical, mythological, and religious traditions, as well as remarkable architectural and artistic accomplishments.

== Definitions ==
The Nahuatl words &quot;aztēcatl&quot; (, singular) and &quot;aztēcah&quot; (, plural) mean &quot;people from Aztlán&quot;, a mythical place of origin for several ethnic groups in central Mexico. The term was not used as an endonym by the Aztecs themselves, but it is found in the different migration accounts of the Mexica, where it describes the different tribes who left Aztlan together. In one account of the journey from Aztlan, Huitzilopochtli, the tutelary deity of the Mexica tribe, tells his followers on the journey that &quot;now, no longer is your name Azteca, you are now Mexitin [Mexica]&quot;.

In today&#x27;s usage, the term &quot;Aztec&quot; often refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as &quot;Mēxihcah&quot; (, a tribal designation that included the Tlatelolco), &quot;Tenochcah&quot; (, referring only to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan, excluding Tlatelolco) or &quot;Cōlhuah&quot; (, referring to their royal genealogy tying them to Culhuacan).

Sometimes the term also includes the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan&#x27;s two principal allied city-states, the Acolhuas of Texcoco and the Tepanecs of Tlacopan, who together with the Mexica formed the Aztec Triple Alliance that controlled what is often known as the &quot;Aztec Empire&quot;. The usage of the term &quot;Aztec&quot; in describing the empire centered in Tenochtitlan has been criticized by Robert H. Barlow, who preferred the term &quot;Culhua-Mexica&quot;, and by Pedro Carrasco, who prefers the term &quot;Tenochca empire&quot;. Carrasco writes about the term &quot;Aztec&quot; that &quot;it is of no use for understanding the ethnic complexity of ancient Mexico and for identifying the dominant element in the political entity we are studying&quot;.

In other contexts, Aztec may refer to all the various city-states and their peoples, who shared large parts of their ethnic history and cultural traits with the Mexica, Acolhua, and Tepanecs, and who often also used the Nahuatl language as a lingua franca. An example is Jerome A. Offner&#x27;s &quot;Law and Politics in Aztec Texcoco&quot;. In this meaning, it is possible to talk about an &quot;Aztec civilization&quot; including all the particular cultural patterns common for most of the peoples inhabiting central Mexico in the late postclassic period. Such usage may also extend the term &quot;Aztec&quot; to all the groups in Central Mexico that were incorporated culturally or politically into the sphere of dominance of the Aztec empire.

When used to describe ethnic groups, the term &quot;Aztec&quot; refers to several Nahuatl-speaking peoples of central Mexico in the postclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, especially the Mexica, the ethnic group that had a leading role in establishing the hegemonic empire based at Tenochtitlan. The term extends to further ethnic groups associated with the Aztec empire, such as the Acolhua, the Tepanec, and others that were incorporated into the empire. Charles Gibson enumerates many groups in central Mexico that he includes in his study &quot;The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule&quot; (1964). These include the Culhuaque, Cuitlahuaque, Mixquica, Xochimilca, Chalca, Tepaneca, Acolhuaque, and Mexica.

In older usage, the term was commonly used about modern Nahuatl-speaking ethnic groups, as Nahuatl was previously referred to as the &quot;Aztec language&quot;. In recent usage, these ethnic groups are referred to as the Nahua peoples. Linguistically, the term &quot;Aztecan&quot; is still used about the branch of the Uto-Aztecan languages (also sometimes called the Uto-Nahuan languages) that includes the Nahuatl language and its closest relatives Pochutec and Pipil.

To the Aztecs themselves the word &quot;Aztec&quot; was not an endonym for any particular ethnic group. Rather, it was an umbrella term used to refer to several ethnic groups, not all of them Nahuatl-speaking, that claimed heritage from the mythic place of origin, Aztlan. Alexander von Humboldt originated the modern usage of &quot;Aztec&quot; in 1810, as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the Mexica state and the Triple Alliance. In 1843, with the publication of the work of William H. Prescott on the history of the conquest of Mexico, the term was adopted by most of the world, including 19th-century Mexican scholars who saw it as a way to distinguish present-day Mexicans from pre-conquest Mexicans. This usage has been the subject of debate in more recent years, but the term &quot;Aztec&quot; is still more common.

== History ==
===Sources of knowledge===
Knowledge of Aztec society rests on several different sources: The many archeological remains of everything from temple pyramids to thatched huts can be used to understand many of the aspects of what the Aztec world was like. However, archeologists often must rely on knowledge from other sources to interpret the historical context of artifacts. There are many written texts by the indigenous people and Spaniards of the early colonial period that contain invaluable information about pre-colonial Aztec history. These texts provide insight into the political histories of various Aztec city-states, and their ruling lineages. Such histories were produced as well in pictorial codices. Some of these manuscripts were entirely pictorial, often with glyphs. In the postconquest era, many other texts were written in Latin script by either literate Aztecs or by Spanish friars who interviewed the native people about their customs and stories. An important pictorial and alphabetic text produced in the early sixteenth century was &quot;Codex Mendoza&quot;, named after the first viceroy of Mexico and perhaps commissioned by him, to inform the Spanish crown about the political and economic structure of the Aztec empire. It has information naming the polities that the Triple Alliance conquered, the types of taxes rendered to the Aztec Empire, and the class/gender structure of their society. Many written annals exist, written by local Nahua historians recording the histories of their polity. These annals used pictorial histories and were subsequently transformed into alphabetic annals in Latin script. Well-known native chroniclers and annalists are Chimalpahin of Amecameca-Chalco; Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc of Tenochtitlan; Alva Ixtlilxochitl of Texcoco, Juan Bautista Pomar of Texcoco, and Diego Muñoz Camargo of Tlaxcala. There are also many accounts by Spanish conquerors who participated in the Spanish invasion, such as Bernal Díaz del Castillo who wrote a full history of the conquest.

Spanish friars also produced documentation in chronicles and other types of accounts. Of key importance is Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, one of the first twelve Franciscans arriving in Mexico in 1524. Another Franciscan of great importance was Fray Juan de Torquemada, author of &quot;Monarquia Indiana&quot;. Dominican Diego Durán also wrote extensively about pre-Hispanic religion as well as the history of the Mexica. An invaluable source of information about many aspects of Aztec religious thought, political and social structure, as well as the history of the Spanish conquest from the Mexica viewpoint is the Florentine Codex. Produced between 1545 and 1576 in the form of an ethnographic encyclopedia written bilingually in Spanish and Nahuatl, by Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún and indigenous informants and scribes, it contains knowledge about many aspects of precolonial society from religion, calendrics, botany, zoology, trades and crafts and history. Another source of knowledge is the cultures and customs of the contemporary Nahuatl speakers who can often provide insights into what prehispanic ways of life may have been like. Scholarly study of Aztec civilization is most often based on scientific and multidisciplinary methodologies, combining archeological knowledge with ethnohistorical and ethnographic information.

===Central Mexico in the classic and postclassic===
It is a matter of debate whether the enormous city of Teotihuacan was inhabited by speakers of Nahuatl, or whether Nahuas had not yet arrived in central Mexico in the classic period. It is generally agreed that the Nahua peoples were not indigenous to the highlands of central Mexico, but that they gradually migrated into the region from somewhere in northwestern Mexico. At the fall of Teotihuacan in the 6th century CE, some city-states rose to power in central Mexico, some of them, including Cholula and Xochicalco, probably inhabited by Nahuatl speakers. One study has suggested that Nahuas originally inhabited the Bajío area around Guanajuato which reached a population peak in the 6th century, after which the population quickly diminished during a subsequent dry period. This depopulation of the Bajío coincided with an incursion of new populations into the Valley of Mexico, which suggests that this marks the influx of Nahuatl speakers into the region. These people populated central Mexico, dislocating speakers of Oto-Manguean languages as they spread their political influence south. As the former nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples mixed with the complex civilizations of Mesoamerica, adopting religious and cultural practices, the foundation for later Aztec culture was laid. After 900 CE, during the postclassic period, many sites almost certainly inhabited by Nahuatl speakers became powerful. Among them are the site of Tula, Hidalgo, and also city-states such as Tenayuca, and Colhuacan in the valley of Mexico and Cuauhnahuac in Morelos.

===Mexica migration and foundation of Tenochtitlan===
In the ethnohistorical sources from the colonial period, the Mexica themselves describe their arrival in the Valley of Mexico. The ethnonym Aztec (Nahuatl &quot;Aztecah&quot;) means &quot;people from Aztlan&quot;, Aztlan being a mythical place of origin toward the north. Hence the term applied to all those peoples who claimed to carry the heritage from this mythical place. The migration stories of the Mexica tribe tell how they traveled with other tribes, including the Tlaxcalteca, Tepaneca, and Acolhua, but that eventually their tribal deity Huitzilopochtli told them to split from the other Aztec tribes and take on the name &quot;Mexica&quot;. At the time of their arrival, there were many Aztec city-states in the region. The most powerful were Colhuacan to the south and Azcapotzalco to the west. The Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco soon expelled the Mexica from Chapultepec and executed the first Aztec royal family except Queen Chimalxochitl II. In 1299, Colhuacan ruler Cocoxtli permitted them to settle in the empty barrens of Tizapan, where they were eventually assimilated into Culhuacan culture. The noble lineage of Colhuacan traced its roots back to the legendary city-state of Tula, and by marrying into Colhua families, the Mexica now appropriated this heritage. After living in Colhuacan, the Mexica were again expelled and were forced to move.

According to Aztec legend, in 1323, the Mexica were shown a vision of an eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus, eating a snake. The vision indicated the location where they were to build their settlement. The Mexica founded Tenochtitlan on a small swampy island in Lake Texcoco, the inland lake of the Basin of Mexico. The year of foundation is usually given as 1325. In 1376 the Mexica royal dynasty was founded when Acamapichtli, son of a Mexica father and a Colhua mother, was elected as the first &quot;Huey Tlatoani&quot; of Tenochtitlan.

===Early Mexica rulers===

In the first 50 years after the founding of the Mexica dynasty, the Mexica were a tributary of Azcapotzalco, which had become a major regional power under the ruler Tezozomoc. The Mexica supplied the Tepaneca with warriors for their successful conquest campaigns in the region and received part of the tribute from the conquered city-states. In this way, the political standing and economy of Tenochtitlan gradually grew.

In 1396, at Acamapichtli&#x27;s death, his son Huitzilihhuitl ( &quot;Hummingbird feather&quot;) became ruler; married to Tezozomoc&#x27;s daughter, the relationship with Azcapotzalco remained close. Chimalpopoca ( &quot;She smokes like a shield&quot;), son of Huitzilihhuitl, became ruler of Tenochtitlan in 1417. In 1418, Azcapotzalco initiated a war against the Acolhua of Texcoco and killed their ruler Ixtlilxochitl. Even though Ixtlilxochitl was married to Chimalpopoca&#x27;s daughter, the Mexica ruler continued to support Tezozomoc. Tezozomoc died in 1426, and his sons began a struggle for the rulership of Azcapotzalco. During this power struggle, Chimalpopoca died, probably killed by Tezozomoc&#x27;s son Maxtla who saw him as a competitor. Itzcoatl, brother of Huitzilihhuitl and uncle of Chimalpopoca, was elected the next Mexica &quot;tlatoani&quot;. The Mexica were now in open war with Azcapotzalco and Itzcoatl petitioned for an alliance with Nezahualcoyotl, son of the slain Texcocan ruler Ixtlilxochitl against Maxtla. Itzcoatl also allied with Maxtla&#x27;s brother Totoquihuaztli ruler of the Tepanec city of Tlacopan. The Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan besieged Azcapotzalco, and in 1428 they destroyed the city and sacrificed Maxtla. Through this victory, Tenochtitlan became the dominant city-state in the Valley of Mexico, and the alliance between the three city-states provided the basis on which the Aztec Empire was built.

Itzcoatl proceeded by securing a power basis for Tenochtitlan, by conquering the city-states on the southern lake – including Culhuacan, Xochimilco, Cuitlahuac, and Mizquic. These states had an economy based on highly productive chinampa agriculture, cultivating human-made extensions of rich soil in the shallow lake Xochimilco. Itzcoatl then undertook further conquests in the valley of Morelos, subjecting the city-state of Cuauhnahuac (today Cuernavaca).

===Early rulers of the Aztec Empire===
====Motecuzoma I Ilhuicamina====

In 1440, Moteuczomatzin Ilhuicamina ( &quot;he frowns like a lord, he shoots the sky&quot;) was elected tlatoani; he was the son of Huitzilihhuitl, brother of Chimalpopoca and had served as the war leader of his uncle Itzcoatl in the war against the Tepanecs. The accession of a new ruler in the dominant city-state was often an occasion for subjected cities to rebel by refusing to pay taxes. This meant that new rulers began their rule with a coronation campaign, often against rebellious provinces, but also sometimes demonstrating their military might by making new conquests. Motecuzoma tested the attitudes of the cities around the valley by requesting laborers for the enlargement of the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan. Only the city of Chalco refused to provide laborers, and hostilities between Chalco and Tenochtitlan would persist until the 1450s. Motecuzoma then reconquered the cities in the valley of Morelos and Guerrero, and then later undertook new conquests in the Huaxtec region of northern Veracruz, and the Mixtec region of Coixtlahuaca and large parts of Oaxaca, and later again in central and southern Veracruz with conquests at Cosamalopan, Ahuilizapan, and Cuetlaxtlan. During this period the city-states of Tlaxcalan, Cholula and Huexotzinco emerged as major competitors to the imperial expansion, and they supplied warriors to several of the cities conquered. Motecuzoma therefore initiated a state of low-intensity warfare against these three cities, staging minor skirmishes called &quot;Flower Wars&quot; (Nahuatl &quot;xochiyaoyotl&quot;) against them, perhaps as a strategy of exhaustion. In the Valley of Oaxaca, which was invaded Moctezuma&#x27;s forces in the 1450s, the Aztec Empire would oppress the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples, who they would also require to pay tributes. 

Motecuzoma I also consolidated the political structure of the Triple Alliance and the internal political organization of Tenochtitlan. His brother Tlacaelel served as his main advisor () and he is considered the architect of major political reforms in this period, consolidating the power of the noble class () and instituting a set of legal codes, and the practice of reinstating conquered rulers in their cities bound by fealty to the Mexica tlatoani.

====Axayacatl and Tizoc====
In 1469, the next ruler was Axayacatl ( &quot;Water mask&quot;), son of Itzcoatl&#x27;s son Tezozomoc and Motecuzoma I&#x27;s daughter Atotoztli II. He undertook a successful coronation campaign far south of Tenochtitlan against the Zapotecs in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Axayacatl also conquered the independent Mexica city of Tlatelolco, located on the northern part of the island where Tenochtitlan was also located. The Tlatelolco ruler Moquihuix was married to Axayacatl&#x27;s sister, and his alleged mistreatment of her was used as an excuse to incorporate Tlatelolco and its important market directly under the control of the tlatoani of Tenochtitlan.

Axayacatl then conquered areas in Central Guerrero, the Puebla Valley, on the gulf coast and against the Otomi and Matlatzinca in the Toluca Valley. The Toluca Valley was a buffer zone against the powerful Tarascan state in Michoacan, against which Axayacatl turned next. In the major campaign against the Tarascans () in 1478–1479 the Aztec forces were repelled by a well-organized defense. Axayacatl was soundly defeated in a battle at Tlaximaloyan (today Tajimaroa), losing most of his 32,000 men and only barely escaping back to Tenochtitlan with the remnants of his army.

In 1481 at Axayacatls death, his older brother Tizoc was elected ruler. Tizoc&#x27;s coronation campaign against the Otomi of Metztitlan failed as he lost the major battle and only managed to secure 40 prisoners to be sacrificed for his coronation ceremony. Having shown weakness, many cities rebelled and consequently, most of Tizoc&#x27;s short reign was spent attempting to quell rebellions and maintain control of areas conquered by his predecessors. Tizoc died suddenly in 1485, and it has been suggested that he was poisoned by his brother and war leader Ahuitzotl who became the next tlatoani. Tizoc is mostly known as the namesake of the Stone of Tizoc a monumental sculpture (Nahuatl &quot;temalacatl&quot;), decorated with a representation of Tizoc&#x27;s conquests.

====Ahuitzotl====
The next ruler was Ahuitzotl ( &quot;Water monster&quot;), brother of Axayacatl and Tizoc and war leader under Tizoc. His successful coronation campaign suppressed rebellions in the Toluca Valley and conquered Jilotepec and several communities in the northern Valley of Mexico. A second 1521 campaign to the gulf coast was also highly successful. He began an enlargement of the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan, inaugurating the new temple in 1487. For the inauguration ceremony, the Mexica invited the rulers of all their subject cities, who participated as spectators in the ceremony in which an unprecedented number of war captives were sacrificed – some sources giving a figure of 80,400 prisoners sacrificed over four days. Probably the actual figure of sacrifices was much smaller, but still numbering several thousand. There have never been found enough skulls in the capital to satisfy even the most conservative figures. Ahuitzotl also constructed monumental architecture in sites such as Calixtlahuaca, Malinalco, and Tepoztlan. After a rebellion in the towns of Alahuiztlan and Oztoticpac in Northern Guerrero, he ordered the entire population executed and repopulated with people from the valley of Mexico. He also constructed a fortified garrison at Oztuma defending the border against the Tarascan state.

===Final Aztec rulers and the Spanish conquest===
Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin is known to world history as the Aztec ruler when the Spanish invaders and their indigenous allies began their conquest of the empire in a two-year-long campaign (1519–1521). His early rule did not hint at his future fame. He succeeded in the rulership after the death of Ahuitzotl. Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin ( &quot;He frowns like a lord, the youngest child who is dead as he had lived in life but not death&quot;), was a son of Axayacatl, and a war leader. He began his rule in standard fashion, conducting a coronation campaign to demonstrate his skills as a leader. He attacked the fortified city of Nopallan in Oaxaca and subjected the adjacent region to the empire. An effective warrior, Moctezuma maintained the pace of conquest set by his predecessor and subjected large areas in Guerrero, Oaxaca, Puebla, and even far south along the Pacific and Gulf coasts, conquering the province of Xoconochco in Chiapas. he also intensified the flower wars waged against Tlaxcala and Huexotzinco and secured an alliance with Cholula. He also consolidated the class structure of Aztec society, by making it harder for commoners () to accede to the privileged class of the &quot;pipiltin&quot; through merit in combat. He also instituted a strict sumptuary code limiting the types of luxury goods that could be consumed by commoners.

In 1517, Moctezuma received the first news of ships with strange warriors having landed on the Gulf Coast near Cempoallan and he dispatched messengers to greet them and find out what was happening, and he ordered his subjects in the area to keep him informed of any new arrivals. In 1519, he was informed of the arrival of the Spanish fleet of Hernán Cortés, who soon marched toward Tlaxcala where he allied with the traditional enemies of the Aztecs. On 8 November 1519, Moctezuma II received Cortés and his troops and Tlaxcalan allies on the causeway south of Tenochtitlan, and he invited the Spaniards to stay as his guests in Tenochtitlan. When Aztec troops destroyed a Spanish camp on the Gulf Coast, Cortés ordered Moctezuma to execute the commanders responsible for the attack, and Moctezuma complied. At this point, the power balance had shifted toward the Spaniards who now held Moctezuma as a prisoner in his palace. As this shift in power became clear to Moctezuma&#x27;s subjects, the Spaniards became increasingly unwelcome in the capital city, and, in June 1520, hostilities broke out, culminating in the massacre in the Great Temple, and a major uprising of the Mexica against the Spanish. During the fighting, Moctezuma was killed, either by the Spaniards who killed him as they fled the city, or by the Mexica themselves who considered him a traitor.

Cuitláhuac, a kinsman and adviser to Moctezuma, succeeded him as tlatoani, mounting the defense of Tenochtitlan against the Spanish invaders and their indigenous allies. He ruled for only 80 days, perhaps dying in a smallpox epidemic, although early sources do not give the cause. He was succeeded by Cuauhtémoc, the last independent Mexica tlatoani, who continued the fierce defense of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs were weakened by disease, and the Spanish enlisted tens of thousands of Indian allies, especially Tlaxcalans, for the assault on Tenochtitlan. After the siege and destruction of the Aztec capital, Cuauhtémoc was captured on 13 August 1521, marking the beginning of Spanish hegemony in central Mexico. Spaniards held Cuauhtémoc captive until he was tortured and executed on the orders of Cortés, supposedly for treason, during an ill-fated expedition to Honduras in 1525. His death marked the end of a tumultuous era in Aztec political history.

After the fall of the Aztec Empire, entire Nahua communities were subject to forced labor under the &quot;encomienda&quot; system, the Aztec education system was abolished and replaced by a very limited church education, and Aztec religious practices were forcibly replaced with Catholicism.

==Social and political organization==

===Nobles and commoners===

The highest class was the &quot;pīpiltin&quot; or nobility. The &quot;pilli&quot; status was hereditary and ascribed certain privileges to its holders, such as the right to wear particularly fine garments and consume luxury goods, as well as to own land and direct corvee labor by commoners. The most powerful nobles were called lords () and they owned and controlled noble estates or houses, and could serve in the highest government positions or as military leaders. Nobles made up about five percent of the population.

The second class was the &quot;mācehualtin&quot;, originally peasants, but later extended to the lower working classes in general. Eduardo Noguera estimates that in later stages only 20 percent of the population was dedicated to agriculture and food production. The other 80 percent of society were warriors, artisans, and traders. Eventually, most of the &quot;mācehuallis&quot; were dedicated to arts and crafts. Their works were an important source of income for the city. Macehualtin could become enslaved, () for example if they had to sell themselves into the service of a noble due to debt or poverty, but enslavement was not an inherited status among the Aztecs. Some macehualtin were landless and worked directly for a lord (), whereas the majority of commoners were organized into calpollis which gave them access to land and property.

Commoners were able to obtain privileges similar to those of the nobles by demonstrating prowess in warfare. When a warrior took a captive he accrued the right to use certain emblems, weapons, or garments, and as he took more captives his rank and prestige increased.

===Family and gender===

The Aztec family pattern was bilateral, counting relatives on the father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s side of the family equally, and inheritance was also passed both to sons and daughters. This meant that women could own property just as men and that women therefore had a good deal of economic freedom from their spouses. Nevertheless, Aztec society was highly gendered with separate gender roles for men and women. Men were expected to work outside of the house, as farmers, traders, craftsmen, and warriors, whereas women were expected to take responsibility for the domestic sphere. Women could however also work outside of the home as small-scale merchants, doctors, priests, and midwives. Warfare was highly valued and a source of high prestige, but women&#x27;s work was metaphorically conceived of as equivalent to warfare, and as equally important in maintaining the equilibrium of the world and pleasing the gods. This situation has led some scholars to describe Aztec gender ideology as an ideology not of a gender hierarchy, but of gender complementarity, with gender roles being separate but equal.

Among the nobles, marriage alliances were often used as a political strategy with lesser nobles marrying daughters from more prestigious lineages whose status was then inherited by their children. Nobles were also often polygamous, with lords having many wives. Polygamy was not very common among the commoners and some sources describe it as being prohibited.

===&quot;Altepetl&quot; and &quot;calpolli&quot;===

The main unit of Aztec political organization was the city-state, in Nahuatl called the &quot;altepetl&quot;, meaning &quot;water-mountain&quot;. Each altepetl was led by a ruler, a &quot;tlatoani&quot;, with authority over a group of nobles and a population of commoners. The altepetl included a capital that served as a religious center, the hub of distribution and organization of a local population that often lived spread out in minor settlements surrounding the capital. Altepetl was also the main source of ethnic identity for the inhabitants, even though Altepetl was frequently composed of groups speaking different languages. Each altepetl would see itself as standing in political contrast to other altepetl polities, and war was waged between altepetl states. In this way, Nahuatl-speaking Aztecs of one Altepetl would be solidary with speakers of other languages belonging to the same altepetl, but enemies of Nahuatl speakers belonging to other competing altepetl states. In the basin of Mexico, altepetl was composed of subdivisions called &quot;calpolli&quot;, which served as the main organizational unit for commoners. In Tlaxcala and the Puebla valley, the altepetl was organized into &quot;teccalli&quot; units headed by a lord (), who would hold sway over a territory and distribute rights to land among the commoners. A calpolli was at once a territorial unit where commoners organized labor and land use since the land was not private property, and also often a kinship unit as a network of families that were related through intermarriage. Calpolli leaders might be or become members of the nobility, in which case they could represent their Calpolli interests in the altepetl government.

In the valley of Morelos, archeologist Michael E. Smith estimates that a typical altepetl had from 10,000 to 15,000 inhabitants, and covered an area between . In the Morelos Valley, altepetl sizes were somewhat smaller. Smith argues that the altepetl was primarily a political unit, made up of the population with allegiance to a lord, rather than as a territorial unit. He makes this distinction because in some areas minor settlements with different altepetl allegiances were interspersed.

===Triple Alliance and Aztec Empire===

The Aztec Empire was ruled by indirect means. Like most European empires, it was ethnically very diverse, but unlike most European empires, it was more of a hegemonic confederacy than a single system of government. Ethnohistorian Ross Hassig has argued that the Aztec empire is best understood as an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands; it merely expected taxes to be paid and exerted force only to the degree it was necessary to ensure the payment of taxes. It was also a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected; for example, the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center. The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city-state was conquered, and the Aztecs did not generally interfere in local affairs as long as the tax payments were made and the local elites participated willingly. Such compliance was secured by establishing and maintaining a network of elites, related through intermarriage and different forms of exchange.

Nevertheless, the expansion of the empire was accomplished through military control of frontier zones, in strategic provinces where a much more direct approach to conquest and control was taken. Such strategic provinces were often exempt from taxation. The Aztecs even invested in those areas, by maintaining a permanent military presence, installing puppet rulers, or even moving entire populations from the center to maintain a loyal base of support. In this way, the Aztec system of government distinguished between different strategies of control in the outer regions of the empire, far from the core in the Valley of Mexico. Some provinces were treated as subject provinces, which provided the basis for economic stability for the empire, and strategic provinces, which were the basis for further expansion.

Although the form of government is often referred to as an empire, most areas within the empire were organized as city-states, known as &quot;altepetl&quot; in Nahuatl. These were small polities ruled by a hereditary leader (&quot;tlatoani&quot;) from a legitimate noble dynasty. The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among &quot;altepetl&quot;. Even after the confederation of the Triple Alliance was formed in 1427 and began its expansion through conquest, the &quot;altepetl&quot; remained the dominant form of organization at the local level. The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire&#x27;s hegemonic form of control.

== Economy ==
===Agriculture and subsistence===
Like all Mesoamerican peoples, Aztec society was organized around maize agriculture. The humid environment in the Valley of Mexico with its many lakes and swamps permitted intensive agriculture. The main crops in addition to maize were beans, squashes, chilies, and amaranth. Particularly important for agricultural production in the valley was the construction of chinampas on the lake, artificial islands that allowed the conversion of the shallow waters into highly fertile gardens that could be cultivated year-round. Chinampas are human-made extensions of agricultural land, created from alternating layers of mud from the bottom of the lake, and plant matter and other vegetation. These raised beds were separated by narrow canals, which allowed farmers to move between them by canoe. Chinampas were extremely fertile pieces of land, and yielded, on average, seven crops annually. Based on current chinampa yields, it has been estimated that of chinampa would feed 20 individuals and of &quot;chinampas&quot; could feed 180,000.

The Aztecs further intensified agricultural production by constructing systems of artificial irrigation. While most of the farming occurred outside the densely populated areas, within the cities there was another method of (small-scale) farming. Each family had a garden plot where they grew maize, fruits, herbs, medicines, and other important plants. When the city of Tenochtitlan became a major urban center, water was supplied to the city through aqueducts from springs on the banks of the lake, and they organized a system that collected human waste for use as fertilizer. Through intensive agriculture, the Aztecs were able to sustain a large urbanized population. The lake was also a rich source of proteins in the form of aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians, shrimp, insects and insect eggs, and waterfowl. The presence of such varied sources of protein meant that there was little use for domestic animals for meat (only turkeys and dogs were kept), and scholars have calculated that there was no shortage of protein among the inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico.
===Crafts and trades===
The excess supply of food products allowed a significant portion of the Aztec population to dedicate themselves to trades other than food production. Apart from taking care of domestic food production, women weaved textiles from agave fibers and cotton. Men also engaged in craft specializations such as the production of ceramics and obsidian and flint tools and of luxury goods such as beadwork, featherwork, and the elaboration of tools and musical instruments. Sometimes entire calpollis specialized in a single craft, and in some archeological sites large neighborhoods have been found where- only a single craft specialty was practiced.

The Aztecs did not produce much metalwork but did have knowledge of basic smelting technology for gold, and they combined gold with precious stones such as jade and turquoise. Copper products were generally imported from the Tarascans of Michoacan.

===Trade and distribution===
Products were distributed through a network of markets; some markets specialized in a single commodity (e.g., the dog market of Acolman), and other general markets with the presence of many different goods. Markets were highly organized with a system of supervisors taking care that only authorized merchants were permitted to sell their goods, and punishing those who cheated their customers or sold substandard or counterfeit goods. A typical town would have a weekly market (every five days), while larger cities held markets every day. Cortés reported that the central market of Tlatelolco, Tenochtitlan&#x27;s sister city, was visited by 60,000 people daily. Some sellers in the markets were petty vendors; farmers might sell some of their produce, potters sold their vessels, and so on. Other vendors were professional merchants who traveled from market to market seeking profits.

The pochteca were specialized long-distance merchants organized into exclusive guilds. They made long expeditions to all parts of Mesoamerica bringing back exotic luxury goods, and they served as the judges and supervisors of the Tlatelolco market. Although the economy of Aztec Mexico was commercialized (in its use of money, markets, and merchants), land and labor were not generally commodities for sale, though some types of land could be sold between nobles. In the commercial sector of the economy, several types of money were in regular use. Small purchases were made with cacao beans, which had to be imported from lowland areas. In Aztec marketplaces, a small rabbit was worth 30 beans, a turkey egg cost three beans, and a tamal cost a single bean. For larger purchases, standardized lengths of cotton cloth, called quachtli, were used. There were different grades of quachtli, ranging in value from 65 to 300 cacao beans. About 20 quachtli could support a commoner for one year in Tenochtitlan.

===Taxation===
Another form of distribution of goods was through the payment of taxes. When an altepetl was conquered, the victor imposed a yearly tax, usually paid in the form of whichever local product was most valuable or treasured. Several pages from the Codex Mendoza list subject towns along with the goods they supplied, which included not only luxuries such as feathers, adorned suits, and greenstone beads, but more practical goods such as cloth, firewood, and food. Taxes were usually paid twice or four times a year at differing times.

Archaeological excavations in the Aztec-ruled provinces show that incorporation into the empire had both costs and benefits for provincial peoples. On the positive side, the empire promoted commerce and trade, and exotic goods from obsidian to bronze managed to reach the houses of both commoners and nobles. Trade partners also included the enemy Purépecha (also known as Tarascans), a source of bronze tools and jewelry. On the negative side, imperial taxes imposed a burden on commoner households, who had to increase their work to pay their share of taxes. Nobles, on the other hand, often made out well under the imperial rule because of the indirect nature of imperial organization. The empire had to rely on local kings and nobles and offered them privileges for their help in maintaining order and keeping the tax revenue flowing.

==Urbanism==
Aztec society combined a relatively simple agrarian rural tradition with the development of a truly urbanized society with a complex system of institutions, specializations, and hierarchies. The urban tradition in Mesoamerica was developed during the classic period with major urban centers such as Teotihuacan with a population well above 100,000, and, at the time of the rise of the Aztecs, the urban tradition was ingrained in Mesoamerican society, with urban centers serving major religious, political and economic functions for the entire population.

===Mexico-Tenochtitlan===

The capital city of the Aztec empire was Tenochtitlan, now the site of modern-day Mexico City. Built on a series of islets in Lake Texcoco, the city plan was based on a symmetrical layout that was divided into four city sections called &quot;campan&quot; (directions). Tenochtitlan was built according to a fixed plan and centered on the ritual precinct, where the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan rose above the city. Houses were made of wood and loam, and roofs were made of reed, although pyramids, temples, and palaces were generally made of stone. The city was interlaced with canals, which were useful for transportation. Anthropologist Eduardo Noguera estimated the population at 200,000 based on the house count and merging the population of Tlatelolco (once an independent city, but later became a suburb of Tenochtitlan). If one includes the surrounding islets and shores surrounding Lake Texcoco, estimates range from 300,000 to 700,000 inhabitants. Michael E. Smith gives a somewhat smaller figure of 212,500 inhabitants of Tenochtitlan based on an area of and a population density of 157 inhabitants per hectare (/acre). The second largest city in the valley of Mexico in the Aztec period was Texcoco with some 25,000 inhabitants dispersed over .

The center of Tenochtitlan was the sacred precinct, a walled-off square area that housed the Great Temple, temples for other deities, the ballcourt, the calmecac (a school for nobles), a skull rack &quot;tzompantli,&quot; displaying the skulls of sacrificial victims, houses of the warrior orders and a merchants palace. Around the sacred precinct were the royal palaces built by the tlatoanis.

====The Great Temple====

The centerpiece of Tenochtitlan was the Templo Mayor, the Great Temple, a large stepped pyramid with a double staircase leading up to two twin shrines – one dedicated to Tlaloc, the other to Huitzilopochtli. This was where most of the human sacrifices were carried out during the ritual festivals and the bodies of sacrificial victims were thrown down the stairs. The temple was enlarged in several stages, and most of the Aztec rulers made a point of adding a further stage, each with a new dedication and inauguration. The temple has been excavated in the center of Mexico City and the rich dedicatory offerings are displayed in the Museum of the Templo Mayor.

Archeologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma, in his essay &quot;Symbolism of the Templo Mayor&quot;, posits that the orientation of the temple is indicative of the totality of the vision the Mexica had of the universe (cosmovision). He states that the &quot;principal center, or navel, where the horizontal and vertical planes intersect, that is, the point from which the heavenly or upper plane and the plane of the Underworld begin and the four directions of the universe originate, is the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan&quot;. Matos Moctezuma supports his supposition by claiming that the temple acts as an embodiment of a living myth where &quot;all sacred power is concentrated and where all the levels intersect&quot;.

===Other major city-states===

Other major Aztec cities were some of the previous city-state centers around the lake including Tenayuca, Azcapotzalco, Texcoco, Colhuacan, Tlacopan, Chapultepec, Coyoacan, Xochimilco, and Chalco. In the Puebla Valley, Cholula was the largest city with the largest pyramid temple in Mesoamerica, while the confederacy of Tlaxcala consisted of four smaller cities. In Morelos, Cuahnahuac was a major city of the Nahuatl-speaking Tlahuica tribe, and Tollocan in the Toluca Valley was the capital of the Matlatzinca tribe which included Nahuatl speakers as well as speakers of Otomi and the language today called Matlatzinca. Most Aztec cities had a similar layout with a central plaza with a major pyramid with two staircases and a double temple oriented toward the west.

== Religion ==

Nahuas&#x27; metaphysics centers around , &quot;a single, dynamic, vivifying, eternally self-generating and self-regenerating sacred power, energy or force.&quot; This is conceptualized in a kind of monistic pantheism as manifest in the supreme god , as well as a large pantheon of lesser gods and idealizations of natural phenomena such as stars and fire. Priests and educated upper classes held more monistic views, while the popular religion of the uneducated tended to embrace the polytheistic and mythological aspects.

In common with many other indigenous Mesoamerican civilizations, the Aztecs put great ritual emphasis on , and scheduled festivals, government ceremonies, and even war around key transition dates in the Aztec calendar. Public ritual practices could involve food, storytelling, and dance, as well as ceremonial warfare, the Mesoamerican ballgame, and human sacrifice, as a manner of payment for, or even effecting, the continuation of the days and the cycle of life.

===Deities===

The four main deities worshiped by the Aztecs were Tlaloc, Huitzilopochtli, Quetzalcoatl, and Tezcatlipoca. Tlaloc is a rain and storm deity; Huitzilopochtli, a solar and martial deity and the tutelary deity of the Mexica tribe; Quetzalcoatl, a wind, sky, and star deity and cultural hero; and Tezcatlipoca, a deity of the night, magic, prophecy, and fate. The Great Temple in Tenochtitlan had two shrines on its top, one dedicated to Tlaloc, the other to Huitzilopochtli. The two shrines represented two sacred mountains: the left one was Tonacatepetl, the Hill of Sustenance, whose patron god was Tlaloc, and the right one was Coatepec, whose patron god was Huitzilopochtli. Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca each had separate temples within the religious precinct close to the Great Temple, and the high priests of the Great Temple were named &quot;Quetzalcoatl Tlamacazqueh&quot;. Other major deities were Tlaltecutli or Coatlicue (a female earth deity); the deity couple Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl (associated with life and sustenance); Mictlantecutli and Mictlancihuatl, a male and female couple of deities that represented the underworld and death; Chalchiutlicue (a female deity of lakes and springs); Xipe Totec (a deity of fertility and the natural cycle); Huehueteotl or Xiuhtecuhtli (a fire god); Tlazolteotl (a female deity tied to childbirth and sexuality); and Xochipilli and Xochiquetzal (gods of song, dance and games). In some regions, particularly Tlaxcala, Mixcoatl or Camaxtli was the main tribal deity. A few sources mention a binary deity, Ometeotl, who may have been a god of the duality between life and death, male and female, and who may have incorporated Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl. Some historians argue against the notion that Ometeotl was a dual god, claiming that scholars are applying their preconceived ideas onto translated texts. Apart from the major deities, there were dozens of minor deities each associated with an element or concept, and as the Aztec empire grew so did their pantheon because they adopted and incorporated the local deities of conquered people into their own. Additionally, the major gods had many alternative manifestations or aspects, creating small families of gods with related aspects.

===Mythology and worldview===

Aztec mythology is known from many sources written down in the colonial period. One set of myths, called Legend of the Suns, describes the creation of four successive suns, or periods, each ruled by a different deity and inhabited by a different group of beings. Each period ends in a cataclysmic destruction that sets the stage for the next period to begin. In this process, the deities Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl appear as adversaries, each destroying the creations of the other. The current Sun, the fifth, was created when a minor deity sacrificed himself on a bonfire and turned into the sun, but the sun only begins to move once the other deities sacrifice themselves and offer it their life force.

In another myth of how the earth was created, Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl appear as allies, defeating a giant crocodile Cipactli, and requiring her to become the earth, allowing humans to carve into her flesh and plant their seeds, on the condition that in return they will offer blood to her. In the story of the creation of humanity, Quetzalcoatl travels with his twin Xolotl to the underworld and brings back bones which are then ground like corn on a metate by the goddess Cihuacoatl, the resulting dough is given human form and comes to life when Quetzalcoatl imbues it with his blood.

Huitzilopochtli is the deity tied to the Mexica tribe and he figures in the story of the origin and migrations of the tribe. On their journey, Huitzilopochtli, in the form of a deity bundle carried by the Mexica priest, continuously spurs the tribe by pushing them into conflict with their neighbors whenever they are settled in a place. In another myth, Huitzilopochtli defeats and dismembers his sister the lunar deity Coyolxauhqui, and her four hundred brothers at the hill of Coatepetl. The southern side of the Great Temple, also called Coatepetl, was a representation of this myth, and at the foot of the stairs lay a large stone monolith carved with a representation of the dismembered goddess.

===Calendar===

Aztec religious life was organized around the calendars. Like most Mesoamerican people, the Aztecs used two calendars simultaneously: a ritual calendar of 260 days called the &quot;tonalpohualli&quot; and a solar calendar of 365 days called the &quot;xiuhpohualli&quot;. Each day had a name and number in both calendars, and the combination of two dates was unique within 52 years. The tonalpohualli was mostly used for divinatory purposes and it consisted of 20-day signs and number coefficients of 1–13 that cycled in a fixed order. The &quot;xiuhpohualli&quot; was made up of 18 &quot;months&quot; of 20 days, and with a remainder of five &quot;void&quot; days at the end of a cycle before the new &quot;xiuhpohualli&quot; cycle began. Each 20-day month was named after the specific ritual festival that began the month, many of which contained a relation to the agricultural cycle. Whether, and how, the Aztec calendar was corrected for leap year is a matter of discussion among specialists. The monthly rituals involved the entire population as rituals were performed in each household, in the &quot;calpolli&quot; temples, and the main sacred precinct. Many festivals involved different forms of dancing, as well as the reenactment of mythical narratives by deity impersonators and the offering of sacrifice, in the form of food, animals, and human victims.

Every 52 years, the two calendars reached their shared starting point and a new calendar cycle began. This calendar event was celebrated with a ritual known as &quot;Xiuhmolpilli&quot; or the New Fire Ceremony. In this ceremony, old pottery was broken in all homes and all fires in the Aztec realm were put out. Then a new fire was drilled over the breast of a sacrificial victim and runners brought the new fire to the different &quot;calpolli&quot; communities where fire was redistributed to each home. The night without fire was associated with the fear that star demons, &quot;tzitzimimeh&quot;, might descend and devour the earth – ending the fifth period of the sun.

=== Human sacrifice and cannibalism ===

To the Aztecs, death was instrumental in the perpetuation of creation, and gods and humans alike had the responsibility of sacrificing themselves to allow life to continue. As described in the myth of creation above, humans were understood to be responsible for the sun&#x27;s continued revival, as well as for paying the earth for its continued fertility. Blood sacrifice in various forms was conducted. Both humans and animals were sacrificed, depending on the god to be placated and the ceremony being conducted, and priests of some gods were sometimes required to provide their blood through self-mutilation. It is known that some rituals included acts of cannibalism, with the captor and his family consuming part of the flesh of their sacrificed captives, but it is not known how widespread this practice was.

While human sacrifice was practiced throughout Mesoamerica, the Aztecs, according to their accounts, brought this practice to an unprecedented level. For example, for the reconsecration of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, Aztec and Spanish sources later said that 80,400 prisoners were sacrificed over four days, reportedly by Ahuitzotl, the Great Speaker himself. This number, however, is considered by many scholars as wildly exaggerated. Other estimates place the number of human sacrifices at between 1,000 and 20,000 annually.

The scale of Aztec human sacrifice has provoked many scholars to consider what may have been the driving factor behind this aspect of Aztec religion. In the 1970s, Michael Harner and Marvin Harris argued that the motivation behind human sacrifice among the Aztecs was the cannibalization of the sacrificial victims, depicted for example in &quot;Codex Magliabechiano&quot;. Harner claimed that very high population pressure and an emphasis on maize agriculture, without domesticated herbivores, led to a deficiency of essential amino acids among the Aztecs. While there is universal agreement that the Aztecs practiced sacrifice, there is a lack of scholarly consensus as to whether cannibalism was widespread. Harris, the author of &quot;Cannibals and Kings&quot; (1977), has propagated the claim, originally proposed by Harner, that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins. These claims have been refuted by Bernard Ortíz Montellano who, in his studies of Aztec health, diet, and medicine, demonstrates that while the Aztec diet was low in animal proteins, it was rich in vegetable proteins. Ortiz also points to the preponderance of human sacrifice during periods of food abundance following harvests compared to periods of food scarcity, the insignificant quantity of human protein available from sacrifices, and the fact that aristocrats already had easy access to animal protein. Today, many scholars point to ideological explanations of the practice, noting how the public spectacle of sacrificing warriors from conquered states was a major display of political power, supporting the claim of the ruling classes to divine authority. It also served as an important deterrent against rebellion by subjugated polities against the Aztec state, and such deterrents were crucial for the loosely organized empire to cohere.

The Aztecs greatly appreciated the &quot;toltecayotl&quot; (arts and fine craftsmanship) of the Toltecs, who predated the Aztecs in central Mexico. The Aztecs considered Toltec productions to represent the finest state of culture. The fine arts included writing and painting, singing and composing poetry, carving sculptures and producing mosaics, making fine ceramics, producing complex featherwork, and working metals, including copper and gold. Artisans of the fine arts were referred to collectively as &quot;tolteca&quot; (Toltec).

===Writing and iconography===

The Aztecs did not have a fully developed writing system like the Maya; however, like the Maya and Zapotec, they did use a writing system that combined logographic signs with phonetic syllable signs. Logograms would, for example, be the use of an image of a mountain to signify the word &quot;tepetl,&quot; &quot;mountain&quot;, whereas a phonetic syllable sign would be the use of an image of a tooth &quot;tlantli&quot; to signify the syllable &quot;tla&quot; in words unrelated to teeth. The combination of these principles allowed the Aztecs to represent the sounds of names of persons and places. Narratives tended to be represented through sequences of images, using various iconographic conventions such as footprints to show paths, temples on fire to show conquest events, etc.

Epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has demonstrated that the different syllable signs used by the Aztecs almost enabled the representation of all the most frequent syllables of the Nahuatl language (with some notable exceptions), but some scholars have argued that such a high degree of phonetics was only achieved after the conquest when the Aztecs had been introduced to the principles of phonetic writing by the Spanish. Other scholars, notably Gordon Whittaker, have argued that the syllabic and phonetic aspects of Aztec writing were considerably less systematic and more creative than Lacadena&#x27;s proposal suggests, arguing that Aztec writing never coalesced into a strictly syllabic system such as the Maya writing, but rather used a wide range of different types of phonetic signs.

The image to the right demonstrates the use of phonetic signs for writing place names in the colonial Aztec Codex Mendoza. The uppermost place is &quot;Mapachtepec&quot;, meaning literally &quot;Hill of the Raccoon&quot;, but the glyph includes the phonetic prefixes &quot;ma&quot; (hand) and &quot;pach&quot; (moss) over a mountain &quot;tepetl&quot; spelling the word &quot;mapach&quot; (&quot;raccoon&quot;) phonetically instead of logographically. The other two place names, &quot;Mazatlan&quot; (&quot;Place of Many Deer&quot;) and &quot;Huitztlan&quot; (&quot;Place of many thorns&quot;) use the phonetic element &quot;tlan&quot; represented by a tooth (&quot;tlantli&quot;) combined with a deer head to spell &quot;maza&quot; (&quot;mazatl&quot; = deer) and a thorn (&quot;huitztli&quot;) to spell &quot;huitz&quot;.

===Music, song and poetry===

Song and poetry were highly regarded; there were presentations and poetry contests at most of the Aztec festivals. There were also dramatic presentations that included players, musicians, and acrobats. There were several different genres of &quot;cuicatl&quot; (song): &quot;Yaocuicatl&quot; was devoted to war and the god(s) of war, &quot;Teocuicatl&quot; to the gods and creation myths and adoration of said figures, &quot;xochicuicatl&quot; to flowers (a symbol of poetry itself and indicative of the highly metaphorical nature of poetry that often used duality to convey multiple layers of meaning). &quot;Prose&quot; was &quot;tlahtolli&quot;, also with its different categories and divisions.

A key aspect of Aztec poetics was the use of parallelism, using a structure of embedded couplets to express different perspectives on the same element. Some such couplets were diphrasisms, conventional metaphors whereby an abstract concept was expressed metaphorically by using two more concrete concepts. For example, the Nahuatl expression for &quot;poetry&quot; was &quot;in xochitl in cuicatl&quot; a dual term meaning &quot;the flower, the song&quot;.

A remarkable amount of this poetry survives, having been collected during the era of the conquest. In some cases poetry is attributed to individual authors, such as Nezahualcoyotl, &quot;tlatoani&quot; of Texcoco, and Cuacuauhtzin, Lord of Tepechpan, but whether these attributions reflect actual authorship is a matter of opinion. An important collection of such poems is &quot;Romances de los señores de la Nueva España&quot;, collected (Tezcoco 1582), probably by Juan Bautista de Pomar, and the &quot;Cantares Mexicanos&quot;. Both men and women were poets in Aztec society, illustrating pre-Hispanic Mexico&#x27;s gender parallelism in upper-class society. One famous female poet is Macuilxochitzin, whose work primarily focused on the Aztec conquest. 

===Ceramics===
The Aztecs produced ceramics of different types. Common are orange wares, which are orange or buff burnished ceramics with no slip. Red wares are ceramics with a reddish slip. Polychrome ware is ceramics with a white or orange slip, with painted designs in orange, red, brown, and/or black. Very common is &quot;black on orange&quot; ware which is orange ware decorated with painted designs in black.

Aztec black-on-orange ceramics are chronologically classified into four phases: Aztec I and II corresponding to c. 1100–1350 (early Aztec period), Aztec III (c. 1350–1520), and the last phase Aztec IV was the early colonial period. Aztec I is characterized by floral designs and day-name glyphs; Aztec II is characterized by a stylized grass design above calligraphic designs such as S-curves or loops; Aztec III is characterized by very simple line designs; Aztec IV continues some pre-Columbian designs but adds European influenced floral designs. There were local variations on each of these styles, and archeologists continue to refine the ceramic sequence.

Typical vessels for everyday use were clay griddles for cooking (&quot;comalli&quot;), bowls and plates for eating (&quot;caxitl&quot;), pots for cooking (&quot;comitl&quot;), molcajetes or mortar-type vessels with slashed bases for grinding chilli (&quot;molcaxitl&quot;), and different kinds of braziers, tripod dishes, and biconical goblets. Vessels were fired in simple updraft kilns or even in open firing in pit kilns at low temperatures. Polychrome ceramics were imported from the Cholula region (also known as Mixteca-Puebla style), and these wares were highly prized as a luxury ware, whereas the local black on orange styles were also for everyday use.

===Painted art===
Aztec painted art was produced on animal skin (mostly deer), on cotton lienzos, and amate paper made from bark (e.g., from &quot;Trema micrantha&quot; or &quot;Ficus aurea&quot;), it was also produced on ceramics and carved in wood and stone. The surface of the material was often first treated with gesso to make the images stand out more clearly. The art of painting and writing was known in Nahuatl by the metaphor &quot;in tlilli, in tlapalli&quot; – meaning &quot;the black ink, the red pigment&quot;.

There are few extant Aztec-painted books. Of these, none are conclusively confirmed to have been created before the conquest, but several codices must have been painted either right before the conquest or very soon after – before traditions for producing them were much disturbed. Even if some codices may have been produced after the conquest, there is good reason to think that they may have been copied from pre-Columbian originals by scribes. The Codex Borbonicus is considered by some to be the only extant Aztec codex produced before the conquest – it is a calendric codex describing the day and month counts indicating the patron deities of the different periods. Others consider it to have stylistic traits suggesting a post-conquest production.

Some codices were produced post-conquest, sometimes commissioned by the colonial government, for example, Codex Mendoza, were painted by Aztec &quot;tlacuilos&quot; (codex creators), but under the control of Spanish authorities, who also sometimes commissioned codices describing pre-colonial religious practices, for example, Codex Ríos. After the conquest, codices with calendric or religious information were sought out and systematically destroyed by the church – whereas other types of painted books, particularly historical narratives, and tax lists continued to be produced. Although depicting Aztec deities and describing religious practices also shared by the Aztecs of the Valley of Mexico, the codices produced in Southern Puebla near Cholula, are sometimes not considered to be Aztec codices, because they were produced outside of the Aztec &quot;heartland&quot;. Karl Anton Nowotny, nevertheless considered that the Codex Borgia, painted in the area around Cholula and using a Mixtec style, was the &quot;most significant work of art among the extant manuscripts&quot;.

The first Aztec murals were from Teotihuacan. Most of our current Aztec murals were found in Templo Mayor. The Aztec capital was decorated with elaborate murals. In Aztec murals, humans are represented like they are represented in the codices. One mural discovered in Tlateloco depicts an old man and an old woman. This may represent the gods Cipactonal and Oxomico.

===Sculpture===

Sculptures were carved in stone and wood, but few wood carvings have survived. Aztec stone sculptures exist in many sizes from small figurines and masks to large monuments, and are characterized by a high quality of craftsmanship. Many sculptures were carved in highly realistic styles, for example realistic sculpture of animals such as rattlesnakes, dogs, jaguars, frogs, turtles, and monkeys.

In Aztec artwork some monumental stone sculptures have been preserved, such sculptures usually functioned as adornments for religious architecture. Particularly famous monumental rock sculpture includes the so-called Aztec &quot;Sunstone&quot; or Calendarstone discovered in 1790; also discovered in 1790 excavations of the Zócalo was the Coatlicue statue made of andesite, representing a serpentine chthonic goddess with a skirt made of rattlesnakes. The Coyolxauhqui Stone representing the dismembered goddess Coyolxauhqui, found in 1978, was at the foot of the staircase leading up to the Great Temple in Tenochtitlan. Two important types of sculpture are unique to the Aztecs, and related to the context of ritual sacrifice: the &quot;cuauhxicalli&quot; or &quot;eagle vessel&quot;, large stone bowls often shaped like eagles or jaguars used as a receptacle for extracted human hearts; the &quot;temalacatl&quot;, a monumental carved stone disk to which war captives were tied and sacrificed in a form of gladiatorial combat. The most well-known examples of this type of sculpture are the Stone of Tizoc and the Stone of Motecuzoma I, both carved with images of warfare and conquest by specific Aztec rulers. Many smaller stone sculptures depicting deities also exist. The style used in religious sculpture was rigid stances likely meant to create a powerful experience for the onlooker. Although Aztec stone sculptures are now displayed in museums as unadorned rock, they were originally painted in vivid polychrome color, sometimes covered first with a base coat of plaster. Early Spanish conquistador accounts also describe stone sculptures as having been decorated with precious stones and metal, inserted into the plaster.

===Featherwork===

An especially prized art form among the Aztecs was featherwork – the creation of intricate and colorful mosaics of feathers, and their use in garments as well as decoration on weaponry, war banners, and warrior suits. The class of highly skilled and honored craftsmen who created feather objects was called the &quot;amanteca&quot;, named after the &quot;Amantla&quot; neighborhood in Tenochtitlan where they lived and worked. They did not pay taxes nor were required to perform public service. The Florentine Codex gives information about how feather works were created. The amanteca had two ways of creating their works. One was to secure the feathers in place using agave cords for three-dimensional objects such as fly whisks, fans, bracelets, headgear, and other objects. The second and more difficult was a mosaic-type technique, which the Spanish also called &quot;feather painting&quot;. These were done principally on feather shields and cloaks for idols. Feather mosaics were arrangements of minute fragments of feathers from a wide variety of birds, generally worked on a paper base, made from cotton and paste, then itself backed with amate paper, but bases of other types of paper and directly on amate were done as well. These works were done in layers with &quot;common&quot; feathers, dyed feathers, and precious feathers. First, a model was made with lower-quality feathers and the precious feathers were found only on the top layer. The adhesive for the feathers in the Mesoamerican period was made from orchid bulbs. Feathers from local and faraway sources were used, especially in the Aztec Empire. The feathers were obtained from wild birds as well as from domesticated turkeys and ducks, with the finest quetzal feathers coming from Chiapas, Guatemala, and Honduras. These feathers were obtained through trade and taxes. Due to the difficulty of conserving feathers, fewer than ten pieces of original Aztec featherwork exist today.

== Colonial period, 1521–1821 ==

Mexico City was built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan, gradually replacing and covering the lake, the island and the architecture of Aztec Tenochtitlan. After the fall of Tenochtitlan, Aztec warriors were enlisted as auxiliary troops alongside the Spanish Tlaxcalteca allies, and Aztec forces participated in all of the subsequent campaigns of conquest in northern and southern Mesoamerica. This meant that aspects of Aztec culture and the Nahuatl language continued to expand during the early colonial period as Aztec auxiliary forces made permanent settlements in many of the areas that were put under the Spanish crown.

The Aztec ruling dynasty continued to govern the indigenous polity of San Juan Tenochtitlan, a division of the Spanish capital of Mexico City, but the subsequent indigenous rulers were mostly puppets installed by the Spanish. One was Andrés de Tapia Motelchiuh, who was appointed by the Spanish. Other former Aztec city states likewise were established as colonial indigenous towns, governed by a local indigenous &quot;gobernador&quot;. This office was often initially held by the hereditary indigenous ruling line, with the &quot;gobernador&quot; being the tlatoani, but the two positions in many Nahua towns became separated over time. Indigenous governors were in charge of the colonial political organization of the Indians. In particular, they enabled the continued functioning of the tax and enslavement of indigenous commoners to benefit the Spanish encomenderos. Encomenderos owned &quot;encomiendas&quot;, large tracts of agricultural land on which the encomenderos and their slaves lived. The Spanish coerced the tribes into granting them private ownership of indigenous people and land for enslavement and encomiendas. Occasionally, an Indigenous individual benefited from this system and grew into substantial wealth and power come the colonial period.

===Population decline===
After the arrival of the Europeans in Mexico and the conquest, indigenous populations declined significantly. This was largely the result of the epidemics of viruses brought to the continent against which the natives had no immunity. In 1520–1521, an outbreak of smallpox swept through the population of Tenochtitlan and was decisive in the fall of the city; further significant epidemics struck in 1545 and 1576.

There has been no consensus about the population size of Mexico at the time of European arrival. Early estimates gave very small population figures for the Valley of Mexico, in 1942 Kubler estimated a figure of 200,000. In 1963 Borah and Cook used preconquest tax lists to calculate the number of residents in central Mexico, estimating over 18–30 million. Their very high figure has been highly criticized for relying on unwarranted assumptions. Archeologist William Sanders based an estimate on archeological evidence of dwellings, arriving at an estimate of 1–1.2 million inhabitants in the Valley of Mexico. Whitmore used a computer simulation model based on colonial censuses to arrive at an estimate of 1.5 million for the Basin in 1519, and an estimate of 16 million for all of Mexico. Depending on the estimations of the population in 1519 the scale of the decline in the 16th century, range from around 50 percent to around 90 percent – with Sanders&#x27;s and Whitmore&#x27;s estimates being around 90 percent.

===Social and political continuity and change===
Although the Aztec empire fell, some of its highest elites continued to hold elite status in the colonial era. The principal heirs of Moctezuma II and their descendants retained high status. His son Pedro Moctezuma produced a son, who married into the Spanish aristocracy and a further generation saw the creation of the title Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo. From 1696 to 1701, the Viceroy of Mexico held the title of Count of Moctezuma. In 1766, the holder of the title became a Grandee of Spain. In 1865, (during the Second Mexican Empire) the title, which was held by Antonio María Moctezuma-Marcilla de Teruel y Navarro, 14th Count of Moctezuma de Tultengo, was elevated to that of a Duke, thus becoming Duke of Moctezuma, with &quot;de Tultengo&quot; again added in 1992 by Juan Carlos I. Two of Moctezuma&#x27;s daughters, Doña Isabel Moctezuma and her younger sister, Doña Leonor Moctezuma, were granted extensive &quot;encomiendas&quot; in perpetuity by Hernán Cortes. Doña Leonor Moctezuma married in succession two Spaniards, and left her &quot;encomiendas&quot; to her daughter by her second husband.

The different Nahua peoples, just like other Mesoamerican indigenous peoples in colonial New Spain, were able to maintain many aspects of their social and political structure under colonial rule. The basic division the Spanish made was between the Indigenous populations, organized under the &quot;República de indios&quot;, which was separate from the Hispanic sphere, the &quot;República de españoles&quot;. The &quot;República de españoles&quot; included not just Europeans, but also Africans and mixed-race castas. The Spanish recognized the indigenous elites as nobles in the Spanish colonial system, maintaining the status distinction of the preconquest era, and used these noblemen as intermediaries between the Spanish colonial government and their communities. This was contingent on their conversion to Christianity and continuing loyalty to the Spanish crown. Colonial Nahua polities had considerable autonomy to regulate their local affairs. The Spanish rulers did not entirely understand the indigenous political organization, but they recognized the importance of the existing system and their elite rulers. They reshaped the political system utilizing &quot;altepetl&quot; or city-states as the basic unit of governance. In the colonial era, &quot;altepetl&quot; was renamed &quot;cabeceras&quot; or &quot;head towns&quot; (although they often retained the term &quot;altepetl&quot; in local-level, Nahuatl-language documentation), with outlying settlements governed by the &quot;cabeceras&quot; named &quot;sujetos&quot;, subject communities. In &quot;cabeceras&quot;, the Spanish created Iberian-style town councils, or &quot;cabildos&quot;, which usually continued to function as the elite ruling group had in the Preconquest era. Population decline due to epidemic disease resulted in many population shifts in settlement patterns and the formation of new population centers. These were often forced resettlements under the Spanish policy of &quot;congregación&quot;. Indigenous populations living in sparsely populated areas were resettled to form new communities, making it easier for them to be brought within range of evangelization efforts, and easier for the colonial state to exploit their labor.

== Legacy ==
Today the legacy of the Aztecs lives on in Mexico in many forms. Archeological sites are excavated and opened to the public and their artifacts are prominently displayed in museums. Place names and loanwords from the Aztec language Nahuatl permeate the Mexican landscape and vocabulary, and Aztec symbols and mythology have been promoted by the Mexican government and integrated into contemporary Mexican nationalism as emblems of the country.

During the 19th century, the image of the Aztecs as uncivilized barbarians was replaced with romanticized visions of the Aztecs as original sons of the soil, with a highly developed culture rivaling the ancient European civilizations. When Mexico became independent from Spain, a romanticized version of the Aztecs became a source of images that could be used to ground the new nation as a unique blend of European and American.

===The Aztecs and Mexico&#x27;s national identity===

Aztec culture and history have been central to the formation of a Mexican national identity after Mexican independence in 1821. In 17th and 18th century Europe, the Aztecs were generally described as barbaric, gruesome, and culturally inferior. Even before Mexico achieved its independence, American-born Spaniards (&quot;criollos&quot;) drew on Aztec history to ground their search for symbols of local pride, separate from that of Spain. Intellectuals used Aztec writings, such as those collected by Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, and writings of Hernando Alvarado Tezozomoc, and Chimalpahin to understand Mexico&#x27;s indigenous past in texts by indigenous writers. This search became the basis for what historian D.A. Brading calls &quot;creole patriotism&quot;. Seventeenth-century cleric and scientist, Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora acquired the manuscript collection of Texcocan nobleman Alva Ixtlilxochitl. Creole Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero published &quot;La Historia Antigua de México&quot; (1780–1781) in his Italian exile following the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767, in which he traces the history of the Aztecs from their migration to the last Aztec ruler, Cuauhtemoc. He wrote it expressly to defend Mexico&#x27;s indigenous past against the slanders of contemporary writers, such as Pauw, Buffon, Raynal, and William Robertson. Archeological excavations in 1790 in the capital&#x27;s main square uncovered two massive stone sculptures, buried immediately after the fall of Tenochtitlan in the conquest. Unearthed were the famous calendar stone, as well as a statue of Coatlicue. Antonio de León y Gama&#x27;s 1792 &quot;Descripción histórico y cronológico de las dos piedras&quot; examines the two stone monoliths. A decade later, German scientist Alexander von Humboldt spent a year in Mexico, during his four-year expedition to Spanish America. One of his early publications from that period was &quot;Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas&quot;. Humboldt was important in disseminating images of the Aztecs to scientists and general readers in the Western world.

In the realm of religion, late colonial paintings of the Virgin of Guadalupe have examples of her depicted floating above the iconic nopal cactus of the Aztecs. Juan Diego, the Nahua to whom the apparition was said to appear, links the dark Virgin to Mexico&#x27;s Aztec past.

When New Spain achieved independence in 1821 and became a monarchy, the First Mexican Empire, its flag had the traditional Aztec eagle on a nopal cactus. The eagle had a crown, symbolizing the new Mexican monarchy. When Mexico became a republic after the overthrow of the first monarch Agustín de Iturbide in 1822, the flag was revised to show the eagle with no crown. In the 1860s, when the French established the Second Mexican Empire under Maximilian of Habsburg, the Mexican flag retained the emblematic eagle and cactus, with elaborate symbols of monarchy. After the defeat of the French and their Mexican collaborators, the Mexican Republic was re-established, and the flag returned to its republican simplicity. This emblem has also been adopted as Mexico&#x27;s national coat of arms, and is emblazoned on official buildings, seals, and signs.

Tensions within post-independence Mexico pitted those rejecting the ancient civilizations of Mexico as a source of national pride, the &quot;Hispanistas&quot;, mostly politically conservative Mexican elites, and those who saw them as a source of pride, the &quot;Indigenistas&quot;, who were mostly liberal Mexican elites. Although the flag of the Mexican Republic had the symbol of the Aztecs as its central element, conservative elites were generally hostile to the current indigenous populations of Mexico or crediting them with a glorious pre-Hispanic history. Under Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna, pro-indigenist Mexican intellectuals did not find a wide audience. With Santa Anna&#x27;s overthrow in 1854, Mexican liberals and scholars interested in the indigenous past became more active. Liberals were more favorably inclined toward the Indigenous populations and their history, but considered a pressing matter being the &quot;Indian Problem&quot;. Liberals&#x27; commitment to equality before the law meant that for upwardly mobile Indigenous, such as Zapotec Benito Juárez, who rose in the ranks of the liberals to become Mexico&#x27;s first president of Indigenous origins, and Nahua intellectual and politician Ignacio Altamirano, a disciple of Ignacio Ramírez, a defender of the rights of the indigenous, liberalism presented a way forward in that era. For investigations of Mexico&#x27;s indigenous past, however, the role of moderate liberal José Fernando Ramírez is important, serving as director of the National Museum and doing research utilizing codices, while staying out of the fierce conflicts between liberals and conservatives that led to a decade of civil war. Mexican scholars who pursued research on the Aztecs in the late 19th century were Francisco Pimentel, Antonio García Cubas, Manuel Orozco y Berra, Joaquín García Icazbalceta, and Francisco del Paso y Troncoso contributing significantly to the 19th-century development of Mexican scholarship on the Aztecs.

The late 19th century in Mexico was a period in which Aztec civilization became a point of national pride. The era was dominated by liberal military hero, Porfirio Díaz, a mestizo from Oaxaca who was president of Mexico from 1876 to 1911. His policies opening Mexico to foreign investors and modernizing the country under a firm hand controlling unrest, &quot;Order and Progress&quot;, undermined Mexico&#x27;s indigenous populations and their communities. However, for investigations of Mexico&#x27;s ancient civilizations, his was a benevolent regime, with funds supporting archeological research and for protecting monuments. &quot;Scholars found it more profitable to confine their attention to Indians who had been dead for a number of centuries.&quot; His benevolence saw the placement of a monument to Cuauhtemoc in a major traffic roundabout (&quot;glorieta&quot;) of the wide Paseo de la Reforma, which he inaugurated in 1887. In world fairs of the late 19th century, Mexico&#x27;s pavilions included a major focus on its indigenous past, especially the Aztecs. Mexican scholars such as Alfredo Chavero helped shape the cultural image of Mexico at these exhibitions. 

The Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) and the significant participation of Indigenous people in the struggle in many regions, ignited a broad government-sponsored political and cultural movement of &quot;indigenismo&quot;, with symbols of Mexico&#x27;s Aztec past becoming ubiquitous, most especially in Mexican muralism of Diego Rivera.

In their works, Mexican authors such as Octavio Paz and Agustin Fuentes have analyzed the use of Aztec symbols by the modern Mexican state, critiquing the way it adopts and adapts indigenous culture to political ends, yet they have also in their works made use of the symbolic idiom themselves. Paz for example critiqued the architectural layout of the National Museum of Anthropology, which constructs a view of Mexican history as culminating with the Aztecs, as an expression of a nationalist appropriation of Aztec culture.

===Aztec history and international scholarship===
Scholars in Europe and the United States increasingly wanted investigations into Mexico&#x27;s ancient civilizations, starting in the nineteenth century. Humboldt had been extremely important in bringing ancient Mexico into broader scholarly discussions of ancient civilizations. French Americanist Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg (1814–1874) asserted that &quot;science in our own time has at last effectively studied and rehabilitated America and the Americans from the [previous] viewpoint of history and archeology. It was Humboldt [...] who woke us from our sleep.&quot; Frenchman Jean-Frédéric Waldeck published &quot;Voyage pittoresque et archéologique dans la province d&#x27;Yucatan pendant les années 1834 et 1836&quot; in 1838. Although not directly connected with the Aztecs, it contributed to the increased interest in ancient Mexican studies in Europe. English aristocrat Lord Kingsborough spent considerable energy in their pursuit of understanding ancient Mexico. Kingsborough answered Humboldt&#x27;s call for the publication of all known Mexican codices, publishing nine volumes of &quot;Antiquities of Mexico&quot; (1831–1846) that were richly illustrated, bankrupting him. He was not directly interested in the Aztecs, but rather in proving that Mexico had been colonized by Jews. However, his publication of these valuable primary sources gave others access to them.

In the United States in the early 19th century, interest in ancient Mexico propelled John Lloyd Stephens to travel to Mexico and then publish well-illustrated accounts in the early 1840s. The research of a half-blind Bostonian, William Hickling Prescott, into the Spanish conquest of Mexico, resulted in his highly popular and deeply researched &quot;The Conquest of Mexico&quot; (1843). Although not formally trained as a historian, Prescott drew on the obvious Spanish sources, but also Ixtlilxochitl and Sahagún&#x27;s history of the conquest. His resulting work was a mixture of pro- and anti-Aztec attitudes. It was not only a bestseller in English, but it also influenced Mexican intellectuals, including the leading conservative politician, Lucas Alamán. Alamán pushed back against his characterization of the Aztecs. In the assessment of Benjamin Keen, Prescott&#x27;s history &quot;has survived attacks from every quarter, and still dominates the conceptions of the laymen, if not the specialist, concerning Aztec civilization&quot;. In the later 19th century, businessman and historian Hubert Howe Bancroft oversaw a huge project, employing writers and researchers, to write the history the &quot;Native Races&quot; of North America, including Mexico, California, and Central America. One entire work was devoted to ancient Mexico, half of which concerned the Aztecs. It was a work of synthesis drawing on Ixtlilxochitl and Brasseur de Bourbourg, among others.

When the International Congress of Americanists was formed in Nancy, France in 1875, Mexican scholars became active participants, and Mexico City hosted the biennial multidisciplinary meeting six times, starting in 1895. Mexico&#x27;s ancient civilizations have continued to be the focus of major scholarly investigations by Mexican and international scholars.

===Language and placenames===
The Nahuatl language is today spoken by 1.5 million people, mostly in mountainous areas in the states of central Mexico. Mexican Spanish today incorporates hundreds of loans from Nahuatl, and many of these words have passed into general Spanish use, and further into other world languages.

In Mexico, Aztec place names are ubiquitous, particularly in central Mexico where the Aztec empire was centered, but also in other regions where many towns, cities, and regions were established under their Nahuatl names, as Aztec auxiliary troops accompanied the Spanish colonizers on the early expeditions that mapped New Spain. In this way even towns, that were not originally Nahuatl speaking came to be known by their Nahuatl names. In Mexico City there are commemorations of Aztec rulers, including on the Mexico City Metro, line 1, with stations named for Moctezuma II and Cuauhtemoc.

===Cuisine===
Mexican cuisine continues to be based on staple elements of Mesoamerican cooking and, particularly, of Aztec cuisine: corn, chili, beans, squash, tomato, and avocado. Many of these staple products continue to be known by their Nahuatl names, carrying in this way ties to the Aztec people who introduced these foods to the Spaniards and the world. Through the spread of ancient Mesoamerican food elements, particularly plants, Nahuatl loan words (&quot;chocolate&quot;, &quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;chili&quot;, &quot;avocado&quot;, &quot;tamale&quot;, &quot;taco&quot;, &quot;pupusa&quot;, &quot;chipotle&quot;, &quot;pozole&quot;, &quot;atole&quot;) have been borrowed through Spanish into other languages around the world. Through the spread and popularity of Mexican cuisine, the culinary legacy of the Aztecs can be said to have a global reach. Today, Aztec images and Nahuatl words are often used to lend an air of authenticity or exoticism in the marketing of Mexican cuisine.

===Ethnic identity===
Aztec and Maya were newly listed examples given for American Indian groups in the 2020 United States census, and &quot;Aztec&quot; became the largest American Indian group that respondents identified as having a full background.

===In popular culture===
The idea of the Aztecs has captivated the imaginations of Europeans since the first encounters and has provided many iconic symbols to Western popular culture. In his book &quot;The Aztec Image in Western Thought&quot;, Benjamin Keen argued that Western thinkers have usually viewed Aztec culture through a filter of their cultural interests.

The Aztecs and figures from Aztec mythology feature in Western culture. The name of Quetzalcoatl, a feathered serpent god, has been used for a genus of pterosaurs, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;, a large flying reptile with a wingspan of as much as . Quetzalcoatl has appeared as a character in many books, films and video games. D.H. Lawrence gave the name &quot;Quetzalcoatl&quot; to an early draft of his novel &quot;The Plumed Serpent&quot;, but his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, insisted on a change of title. American author Gary Jennings wrote two acclaimed historical novels set in Aztec-period Mexico, &quot;Aztec&quot; (1980) and &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot; (1997). The novels were so popular that four more novels in the Aztec series were written after his death.

Aztec society has also been depicted in cinema. The Mexican feature film &quot;The Other Conquest&quot; (Spanish: &quot;La Otra Conquista&quot;) from 2000 was directed by Salvador Carrasco and illustrated the colonial aftermath of the 1520s Spanish Conquest of Mexico. It adopted the perspective of an Aztec scribe, Topiltzin, who survived the attack on the temple of Tenochtitlan. The 1989 film &quot;Retorno a Aztlán&quot; by Juan Mora Catlett is a work of historical fiction set during the rule of Motecuzoma I, filmed in Nahuatl and with the alternative Nahuatl title &quot;Necuepaliztli in Aztlan&quot;. In Mexican exploitation B movies of the 1970s, a recurring figure was the &quot;Aztec mummy&quot; as well as Aztec ghosts and sorcerers.

<text>David Carroll Eddings (July 7, 1931 – June 2, 2009) was an American fantasy writer. With his wife Leigh, he authored several best-selling epic fantasy novel series, including &quot;The Belgariad&quot; (1982–84), &quot;The Malloreon&quot; (1987–91), &quot;The Elenium&quot; (1989–91), &quot;The Tamuli&quot; (1992–94), and &quot;The Dreamers&quot; (2003–06).

==Early life and career==
Eddings was born in Spokane, Washington, to George Wayne Eddings and Theone (Berge) Eddings, in 1931. Eddings was known to claim to be part Cherokee.

Eddings grew up near Puget Sound in the City of Snohomish. After graduating from Snohomish High School in 1949, he worked for a year before majoring in speech, drama and English at junior college. Eddings displayed an early talent for drama and literature, winning a national oratorical contest, and performing the male lead in most of his drama productions. He graduated with a BA from Reed College in 1954, writing his first novel, &quot;How Lonely Are The Dead&quot;, as his senior thesis. After graduating from Reed College, Eddings was drafted into the U.S. Army, having also previously served in the National Guard. After being discharged in 1956, Eddings attended the graduate school of the University of Washington in Seattle for four years, graduating with an MA in 1961 after submitting a novel in progress, &quot;Man Running&quot;, for his thesis.

After earning his Master&#x27;s, Eddings worked as a purchaser for Boeing, where he met his future wife, then known as Judith Leigh Schall. They married in 1962, she taking the name Leigh Eddings, and through most of the 1960s, Eddings worked as an assistant professor at Black Hills State College in South Dakota.

=== Child abuse conviction ===
Eddings and his wife Leigh pled guilty to 11 counts of physical child abuse of their adopted children. They adopted one boy in 1966, Scott David, then two months old, and subsequently adopted a girl between 1966 and 1969. In 1970 the couple lost custody of both children and were each sentenced to a year in jail in separate trials for extensive child abuse of both children.

== Literary career ==

=== Early literary career ===
Eddings had completed the first draft of his first published novel, &quot;High Hunt&quot;, in March 1971 while serving his jail term. &quot;High Hunt&quot; was a contemporary story of four young men hunting deer. Like many of his later novels, it explores themes of manhood and coming of age. Convinced that being an author was his future career, after a short period in Denver, David and Leigh Eddings moved to Spokane, where he relied on a job at a grocery shop for his funds. &quot;High Hunt&quot; was published in early 1972 by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons to modestly positive reviews.

Eddings continued to work on several unpublished novels, including &quot;Hunseeker&#x27;s Ascent&quot;, a story about mountain climbing, which was later burned, as Eddings claimed it was &quot;a piece of tripe so bad it even bored me.&quot; Most of his attempts followed the same vein as &quot;High Hunt&quot;: adventure stories and contemporary tragedies. None were sold or published, with the eventual exception of &quot;The Losers&quot;, which tells the story of God and the Devil cast in the roles of Raphael Taylor, gifted student and athlete, and Damon Flood, a scoundrel determined to bring Raphael down. Though written in the 1970s, &quot;The Losers&quot; was not published until June 1992, well after Eddings&#x27; success as an author was established.

===Success in fantasy writing===
Eddings doodled a fantasy map one morning before work. According to Eddings&#x27; account several years later, when seeing a copy of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in a bookshop, he muttered, &quot;Is this old turkey still floating around?&quot;. He was surprised to learn that it was then in its 78th printing. He had, though, already included Tolkien&#x27;s work in the syllabuses for at least three sections of his English Literature survey courses in the summer of 1967 and the springs of 1968 and 1969. He began to annotate the map doodle, which became the basis for his factional country of Aloria. Over the course of a year, Edding detailed around 250 pages of kingdoms, races, characters, theologies and a mythology.

As the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; had been published as three books, Eddings believed fantasy in general was supposed to be published in trilogy form. He initially laid out &quot;The Belgariad&quot; as three books, until his editor, Lester del Rey, advised him that booksellers would refuse to accept books of 600 pages. Del Rey suggested the series be published as five books. Eddings at first refused, but having already signed the contract, and with Del Rey&#x27;s promise that he would receive advances for five books rather than three, agreed to the arrangement. &quot;Pawn of Prophecy&quot;, the first volume in the series, was issued in April 1982. The next four novels where published between then and 1984. The series was popular. Eddings continued to produce fantasy novels for the rest of his life, usually producing a book every year or two.

From 1995 onwards, the novels were credited jointly to Leigh Eddings; Eddings explained in a foreword that their working together as authors &quot;had been the case from the beginning.&quot; This is generally accepted as broadly accurate, although Eddings scholar James Gifford notes that collaboration would have been &quot;impossible&quot; with &quot;High Hunt&quot;, as David Eddings&#x27; own notes show that the first draft was completed while he and Leigh were both in separate jails, about half-way through their terms.

The Eddingses&#x27; final work, the novel series &quot;The Dreamers&quot;, was published in four volumes between 2003 and 2006.

== Later life ==
On January 26, 2007, Eddings accidentally burned about a quarter of his office, next door to his house, along with his Excalibur sports car.

On February 28, 2007, David Eddings&#x27; wife Leigh died following a series of strokes that left her unable to communicate. She was 69. Eddings cared for her at home with her mother after her first stroke, which occurred three years before he finished writing &quot;The Dreamers&quot;.

Eddings died of natural causes on June 2, 2009, in Carson City, Nevada.

Dennis, Eddings&#x27; brother, said that he had suffered from dementia for a long time, but that the disease had progressed rapidly since September 2008, and that he needed 24-hour care. He also confirmed that in his last months, his brother had been working on a manuscript that was unlike any of his other works, stating &quot;It was very, very different. I wouldn&#x27;t call it exactly a satire of fantasy but it sure plays with the genre&quot;. The unfinished work, along with his other manuscripts, went to his alma mater, Reed College, along with a bequest of $18 million to fund &quot;students and faculty studying languages and literature.&quot; Eddings also bequeathed $10 million to the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver for pediatric asthma treatment and research; Eddings&#x27; wife Leigh had asthma throughout her life.

<text>The Belgariad is a five-book fantasy epic written by David Eddings, following the journey of protagonist Garion and his companions, first to recover a sacred stone, and later to use it against antagonist Torak. It was a bestseller from the first book in the series. It has been called both the &quot;last gasp&quot; of traditional fantasy and &quot;one of the founding megasagas&quot; of modern fantasy.

== Background ==
David Eddings, who had been writing adventure and thriller genres, has said he developed the idea for a fantasy series somewhat &quot;cynically&quot; after noticing how many times J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series had been reprinted. He had an epiphany, realizing the fantasy genre might be very lucrative and was currently &quot;underserved&quot;. He mapped out an imaginary world to use in developing the story for the Belgariad.

He has also said he was influenced by reading medieval epics and by Lester del Rey&#x27;s editorial input. In later works he acknowledged his wife, Leigh Eddings, as an &quot;unindicted collaborator&quot;; eventually later books credited her as co-author. She is generally acknowledged as a co-author of the earlier books as well.

== Characters ==
== Works in the series ==

The Belgariad is composed of five books, namely &#x27; (1982), &#x27; (1982), &#x27; (1983), &#x27; (1984), and &quot;&quot; (1984).

The title of each book combines a chess term with a fantasy term; whereas the concept of a &#x27;Game of Destiny&#x27; is a significant motif in the story. The series has been reprinted as a two-volume set, titled &quot;The Belgariad Volume One&quot;, containing the first three books of the series, and &quot;The Belgariad Volume Two&quot;, which contains the last two books. This does not include the original map by Chris Barbieri, but only Shelly Shapiro&#x27;s map.

&quot;The Malloreon&quot; is a five-book sequel to &quot;The Belgariad&quot;. &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot; (1995) and &quot;Polgara the Sorceress&quot; (1997) are prequels that share the setting and most characters. &quot;The Rivan Codex&quot; (1998) features annotated background material.

=== &quot;Pawn of Prophecy&quot; ===

The book opens with a prologue, beginning with the creation of the world by seven gods. Aldur, oldest of the seven, fashions a stone orb and creates within it a &quot;living soul&quot;. Torak, the most beautiful of the seven, attempts to seize the Orb from Aldur and subdue the Orb&#x27;s intelligence; the Orb mutilates the left side of Torak&#x27;s body. The Orb of Aldur is later recovered by Belgarath the Sorcerer, King Cherek, and Cherek&#x27;s sons. Riva, Cherek&#x27;s youngest son, is found to be able to hold the Orb unharmed; he and his descendants protect the Orb from Torak.

The story then begins in earnest with the experiences of protagonist Garion. His childhood on a large, prosperous farm: his earliest memories in the kitchen of his Aunt Pol; his friend Durnik the blacksmith; early games and friends; and the romance between Garion and local girl Zubrette. It also introduces Belgarath, as a wandering storyteller nicknamed &#x27;Mister Wolf&#x27;; Garion&#x27;s telepathic vision of the antagonist Asharak/Chamdar; and a &quot;dry voice&quot; in his mind, distinct from his own consciousness. The reader later discovers that this is the Voice of Prophecy, or &quot;Necessity&quot;, which takes action through him.

When Belgarath, alias &quot;Wolf&quot;, announces the theft of a mysterious object (actually the Orb), he, Garion, and Aunt Pol leave Faldor&#x27;s farm to pursue the thief, reluctantly allowing Durnik to accompany them. They are joined later by Silk/Kheldar, a Drasnian prince, spy, and thief; and by Barak, a Cherek earl. Thereafter Mister Wolf follows an invisible trail through several regions until they are arrested.

They are taken to a meeting of monarchs where Garion suspects a green-cloaked individual of treason. A few days later, Barak and Garion are hunting wild boar when Garion notices the green-cloaked spy discussing further espionage; but before Garion can tell anyone of this, he is attacked by a wild boar, which is then slain by Barak in the form of a bear. Garion later exposes the green-cloaked spy, and the latter&#x27;s patrons are defeated in a fight. Garion himself is almost captured, but escapes. 
Garion learns that Polgara is Belgarath&#x27;s daughter and the sister of Garion&#x27;s second-most-distant female ancestor (identified in the prologue as Queen Beldaran, wife of Riva), and for that reason called his aunt. Having learned this, Garion identifies Belgarath as his grandfather. The group, with the addition of an Algarian prince named Hettar, then leave in search of the Orb.

=== &quot;Queen of Sorcery&quot; ===

The story opens in the Kingdom of Arendia, where Garion duels and then befriends a master archer named Lelldorin. The party travel to Lelldorin&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s manor, where Garion hears about a plot to kill the Mimbrate king Korodullin and to start a civil war between the two grand duchies. The plot is masterminded by a spy from Cthol Murgos named Nachak.
After leaving Lelldorin&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s manor the party journey south towards the great plains where they are ambushed by a group of Algroths; a fictional &quot;monster&quot; devised by Eddings that are something between a goat facially and a gorilla bodily, while being somewhat akin to, even if a bit smaller than a troll (QoS Chapter 6). Lelldorin is gravely injured during the encounter which only ends with the arrival of Mandorallen, the supreme Mimbrate knight of the realm who chases them off. Just as he does so Chamdar&#x27;s shade appears before them to mock them. Belgarath asks whether it was he who drove the Algroths out of the mountains of Ulgoland. Chamdar denies doing so but is less than convincing.

As they continue south, Mandorallen, upon Polgara&#x27;s advice (but unknown to Garion who later judges Mandorallen&#x27;s motives), forces Lelldorin on his honour to stay behind so he can heal from the wounds inflicted by the Algroth who had mauled him.

The party continue without Lelldorin to Vo Mimbre, the Arendish capital, where Garion reveals the plot to kill Korodullin, without naming its local conspirators, and Mandorallen challenges Nachak to a duel, which Hettar terminates by killing Nachak. Soon afterwards the party bid farewell to Vo Mimbre, with King Korodullin vowing to stamp out any untoward activity of the Angaraks (and particularly the Murgos) in his kingdom. He also pledged to ready his kingdom for the anticipated war against Torak&#x27;s forces.

The party next travels to Tolnedra, and soon after crossing the border they come across a group of Monks from Mar Terrin. One of them, driven insane by the continual presence of the spirits of Maragor launches himself at Garion who naturally reaches out a hand. The man falls to the ground with an ugly welt on his head. Polgara instructs Garion to get off his horse and apologise to the man who comes to with his sanity restored. The monks proclaim a miracle, but Garion knows otherwise as do Belgarath and Polgara.

In healing the monk of his madness, Garion performed his first, albeit unknowingly, act of sorcery.

They then press on with their quest with their next planned stop being to talk to the Emperor Ran Borune in the city of Tol Honeth, and are nearly captured by a group of mercenaries for the Queen of neighboring Nyissa. At Tol Honeth, Belgarath and Polgara urge the Emperor to rid Tolnedra of the invading &#x27;Murgos&#x27;; but Ran Borune refuses. Ce&#x27;Nedra bursts in towards the end of the meeting and Garion feels a sense of &quot;recognition&quot; although he has no idea how their lives would become forever entwined in the near future. Almost immediately afterwards Asharak presents himself to Ran Borune and it is revealed that Chamdar and Asharak are in fact the same person.

Upon leaving the capital, the group acquire an ineffectually-disguised Princess Ce&#x27;Nedra (Ran Borune&#x27;s daughter), and enter the Wood of the Dryads, hoping to cross into Nyissa ahead of their opponent Zedar. In the Wood, Ce&#x27;Nedra asks the Dryad Queen Xantha for sanctuary, on grounds of common ancestry; but is refused and soon after the continue on the journey. 

As they set off and leave the Dryads behind Silk and Belgarath head off on their own in pursuit of Zedar and the Orb as they&#x27;d be able to move faster, with the intention being to meet up again in the Nyissan capital of Sthiss Tor in a couple of weeks. 

Meanwhile, the rest of them start making their own way directly to Sthiss Tor, but are detained by Tolnedran legionnaires under the command of Grand Duke Kador of Tol Vordue. They are accompanied by Asharak / Chamdar. Kador demands that Ce&#x27;Nedra be handed over to secure Kador&#x27;s claim on the imperial throne. Asharak just wants Polgara and Garion and doesn&#x27;t care what happens to the others. Polgara is powerless to do anything because Asharak has his hand grasped on Garion&#x27;s heart (in the sense that he could crush it using sorcery). Almost unnoticed Garion alone can act and when Asharak slaps Polgara, Garion strikes Asharak and speaks the word &quot;burn&quot; and Asharak bursts into flames. For just a moment Garion&#x27;s compassion almost saves Asharak but then Polgara tells Garion in his mind that it was Asharak who killed his parents. Suddenly, the flames are not hot enough and Garion keeps the flames on him until he dies. 

Polgara exalts and calls Garion, Belgarion (his birthright name) for the first time.

Upon this shocking act of sorcery Kador&#x27;s men turn against him and remember their loyalty to the Emperor. They take Kador prisoner and promise to deliver him to the garrison at Tol Borune as commanded to by Ce-Nedra who is speaking in her authority as an Imperial Princess of Tolnedra.

Arriving at Nyissa by boat, Garion, angry at the treatment of the slaves there, uses the Will and the Word (the ability shared by himself with Belgarath, Polgara, and all other sorcerers in the story) to teleport one but does not know that the leeches in the river are poisonous so the slave dies. Following a quarrel with Polgara, during which she explains to him that the power he had used to kill Asharak was the same as the one he had earlier used unwittingly to cure a madman, Garion is kidnapped, drugged, and presented to Queen Salmissra to be used as a mind-controlled sex slave. He is rescued by Polgara and Barak (the latter again assuming a bear&#x27;s shape); and Polgara, with permission by Issa, the god of the Nyissans, transforms Salmissra into an immortal snake. Thereafter Garion is reconciled with Polgara.

=== &quot;Magician&#x27;s Gambit&quot; ===

After learning at the end of the Queen of Sorcery that the Angarak sorcerer Ctuchik had stolen the Orb from its erstwhile thief Zedar, Belgarion and friends set off for the Vale of Aldur after Belgarath had received instruction to do so from Aldur Himself.

Although they preferred to avoid it, the party were eventually left with no other choice than to pass through Maragor, which was haunted by the spirit of Mara himself, who manifests his grief (for the Marags were slain by the Tolnedrans many centuries earlier) through countless ghostly apparitions that drive anybody who dares to enter Maragor (usually for the rich gold deposits) mad. On the whole only the monks - &quot;Tolnedra&#x27;s conscience&quot; - are tolerated. 

In order to pass through Maragor mentally unscathed, Belgarath and Polgara put everybody into a trance and somehow, while the others go under, Garion slipped into a semi-wakeful consciousness that has to all intents and purposes turned off his emotions. The &quot;voice&quot; (of the prophecy) had been waiting for this opportunity to talk to him rationally about what he is destined to do and it is here that an analogy comes up.

In the analogy the voice describes how something went wrong in the universe and it created two divergent destinies one of which is the original and the other an alternative. Garion equates this to when Doroon broke a window at Faldor&#x27;s Farm and the voice goes along with this and suggests that if another stone was to be thrown quickly enough then it could deflect the first stone and Faldor&#x27;s window would be saved. The implication being that the voice is the stone-thrower and Garion is the stone.

Soon after the conversation finishes, the party come before Mara and Belgarath and Polgara appeal to him to set aside his grief as the time of prophecy is at hand. Still inconsolable, Mara refuses and his grief turns to anger when he sets his eyes on Ce-Nedra, a child of Nedra. In his anger he threatens her with all kind of unpleasantness and suffering but when he goes to strike against her the voice intervenes through Garion. Too powerful to strike Mara, for fear of destroying the world, the voice stands unmoved and resolute until Mara yields and the voice urges everybody to leave Mara to his grief, as Ce-Nedra&#x27;s presence pains him terribly. 

They duly do so, although Belgarath and the voice talk briefly and both Polgara and Belgarath come to understand that Garion is now ready to be trained in the &quot;Will and the Word&quot;. When the voice goes Garion is put into a deeper slumber like most of the rest of his companions before they are all woken up having passed through Maragor.

Now they are somewhere probably in the foothills of Ulgoland and Hettar notes that one of the pack mares, pregnant, is in serious trouble. With the condition of the mare getting worse and the weather turning against them, Garion suggests they shelter in the cave, which he had previously been unaware of but somehow knew was always there. He led everybody straight to it and they soon took shelter.

The cave, according to Belgarath, was the meeting place of the Gods and where they conferred during the making of the world. 

Soon afterwards the mare gives birth but the foal is stillborn. Without hesitation, Garion moves and brings it back to life. This is of significance because Polgara and Belgarath maintained that before this, it was impossible to use the &quot;Will and the Word&quot; to restore life to the dead. 

Soon afterwards they leave the cave and continue their journey to The Vale.

Upon arriving in the Vale, Aldur confers with Belgarath and Polgara, but before they go aside Garion accompanies Belgarath to his tower and begins his instruction in earnest. Although the significance of what follows is not acknowledged by Eddings until the next chapter, Garion transitions from thinking in terms of &quot;Mister Wolf&quot; and now thinks in terms of &quot;Belgarath&quot;. It is a milestone in the series as Garion leaves behind his childhood understanding and fully accepts that Mister Wolf is in fact Eternal Belgarath. 

Soon afterwards Garion attempts a conscious act of sorcery for the first time rather than an instinctive and spontaneous use of it, as he had done when healing the mad monk, burning Chamdar, translocating the slave in Nyissa and reviving Horse (as the colt came to be known). He moves the self-same rock that Belgarath moved many millennia earlier with semi-disastrous results which prompts a lot of amusement, but more importantly more instruction.

Soon after they leave for Rak Cthol and on their way the group enters Ulgoland, and head for the hidden city of Prolgu which is down in the caves below the ancient city. Proglu was abandoned after the cracking of the world sent the monsters insane. Before they get there they encounter a herd of carnivorous hruglin, horse-like creatures, and have to kill the stallion to drive them off. Just before Hettar kills the stallion his mind (as a Sha-Dar) connects with it just momentarily before the madness returns and he regrettably kills it. 

As they continue they also come face to face with Grul, an Eldrak, a giant creature related to trolls, but far more intelligent and far more deadly. They are forced to fight him to the death and it comes at some cost with both Mandorallen and Durnik suffering significant injuries. Barak also receives a leg wound.

After that, they continue unmolested to Prolgu and are welcomed by the Gorim - chieftain and elder of the Ulgo. They are there to recruit Relg a rock diviner who has both the special ability to detect caves but also to pass through the very rock itself. According to prophecies both Angarak and Western there is enough of a suggestion that caves exist below Rak Cthol which will provide a way in when they go to retrieve the Orb. Relg, as it turns out is a zealot and a fanatic and according to Gorim the &quot;worst of the lot&quot;. When he is presented before Gorim and the party he initially refuses until UL, the father of the Gods makes himself present and commands Relg to go. UL then turns his attention to Ce&#x27;Nedra and compels her to stay behind as a guest of Gorim, the Ulgos. UL warns that if she goes to Cthol Murgos she will surely die and the prophecy will be lost. Ce&#x27;Nedra usually willful and independently minded, recognises the authority of the command and stays behind as ordered.

So with Relg now on board the party travel to Cthol Murgos. On their way to Rak Cthol they meet Yarblek, a Nadrak merchant (who later becomes a significant secondary character) and are nearly caught by Taur Urgas, the King of the Murgos. The party made their escape out of the back of a tent just in time. Silk who&#x27;d tried to flee beforehand, on hearing that Taur Urgas was approaching with an army, was caught by Brill when attempting to flee. The party were in great despair about Silk&#x27;s fate but then Relg, used his specially rock divining gift to go and simply pick him up and. although the experience of seeping through the rock left Silk traumatised he was physically fine and so they continued with the journey. Later Garion learns how to create a mind shield which, with Polgara, is used to hide the party on their approach while Belgarath concentrates on Ctuchik himself. They enter Rak Cthol through the caves that lead to the slave pens and on the way they meet Taiba (a Marag slave woman;&#x27;The Mother of the Race who Died&#x27;) and do what they can to make her comfortable before carrying on. On their way up they encounter Brill again, who Silk dispatches with a throw that tosses him over the parapets to his death. Silk later jokes that Brill was trying to fly, but not doing very well unless &quot;bouncing counts&quot; Ultimately they reach Ctuchik&#x27;s chambers, which only Belgarath, Garion and Polgara enter with the others being told to wait outside. Ctuchik gloats that he has won as he intends to kill Ce&#x27;Nedra and destroy The Prophecy, but then to his chagrin he realises she is not among the party and is invulnerable under the protection of UL himself. Belgarath takes great satisfaction at his adversary&#x27;s miscalculation, which had actually made their passing through of Cthol Murgos easier. Belgarath then fights Ctuchik. Driven by a vision of Garion suddenly taking hold of the Orb, Ctuchik attempts to &quot;unmake&quot; the Orb and thus &quot;unmakes&quot; himself. The explosion sets off an earthquake. The group escapes, taking the now unconscious Belgarath and Errand the Orb Bearer. With the book ending with them fleeing the collapsing city.

=== &quot;Castle of Wizardry&quot; ===

On their way out of the caves under Rak Cthol they pause briefly to pick up Taiba who Relg pulls through the collapsed rocks, just as he has done Silk after he had been captured by Brill. Now out in the open the role of leader is thrust upon Garion with Belgarath incapacitated after his fight with Ctuchik and Polgara focusing on protecting Errand. Unable to attack Errand directly the Hierarchs of Rak Cthol go for Durnik instead. With the guidance of The Prophecy Garion climbs into his shadow and goes after them. He soon finds them in the broken remains of Rak Cthol and shatters the jewel which they are using to concentrate their will before rather melodramatically threatening one of the Hierarchs by clutching his shadow hand around his heart. When Garion&#x27;s shadow returns Belgarath stirs briefly and now the threat has been neutralised they are able to continue unshielded, but with the knowledge that Taur Urgas is pursuing them.

As they race across Cthol Murgos in the direction of Algaria things gets very tight and they are not helped by their horses cramping up. In the end, just when they thought they were about to be intercepted countless Algarian horsemen swept down and slaughtered a great many of the Murgos. For just a brief moment Taur Urgas and King Cho-Hag of Algaria came within range of each other before once more being swept apart by the ensuing battle.

That very evening Belgarath collapses and is carried to The Stronghold with the utmost urgency for his very life was in danger. Cajoled, tormented and molly-coddled, Polgara nurses him back to health. In doing so she abandons her usual remedies as she knows her father well enough to realise that he will just lay back and indulge in being taken care of. What he needed most was mental stimulation and what she feared most was that he might have lost his ability to use the &quot;Will and the Word&quot; the very thing that had kept Angarak in check since The Battle of Vo Mimbre some 500 years earlier.

Once recovered and in time for Erastide they travelled to Riva, but not before picking up Ce&#x27;Nedra from Ulgo. Then as they head west, Garion, Polgara, Ce&#x27;Nedra and Durnik visit Faldor&#x27;s Farm for one last time. For Polgara it was so she could pick up some favourite pots she&#x27;d been left behind, but most importantly it was for Garion to find closure on that chapter of his life which is best represented by how coldly he showed affection, but no love, for Zubrette, his childhood sweetheart.

Now in Riva, Belgarion is led by Belgarath, Polgara, and the Voice of Prophecy to accept the Orb of Aldur from Errand in the Hall of the Rivan King, where the ancient Sword rests above the Rivan Throne. In Garion&#x27;s hands, the Orb identifies him as the long-lost heir to the throne. This revelation infuriates Ce&#x27;Nedra, who discovers herself betrothed to him. During the investiture, Garion, aided by the Voice of Prophecy, sees each member of the quest as an Instrument of Prophecy.

Shortly after the betrothal, Garion learns from the Mrin Prophecy that the Rivan King must slay the god Torak or die in the process. In order to save lives and try to avoid a catastrophic war, like the one that had culminated in the Battle of Vo Mimbre some 500 years previously, Belgarion decided to set off relatively on his own to face Torak.Taking only Belgarath, and Silk with him he left notes for Polgara and Ce&#x27;Nedra with instructions not to pursue them.

From this point in the story the narrative is split into two tracks, with the first following Garion, Belgarath and Silk and the second following Ce&#x27;Nedra and everything that happens around her. The two tracks are brought back together in &quot;Enchanter&#x27;s End Game&quot; when all the protagonists are brought together again just before the confrontation with Torak.

(Additionally, from time to time, in &quot;Enchanter&#x27;s End Game&quot;, a third minor track is added with a chapter devoted to events far away from the main events centred on the rulers of the western kingdoms - including Nyissa).

The three of them pass through Drasnia, where they happen upon Vordai, the Witch of the Fens who is hospitable but quite defensive. Later to their chargin, they realise they are trapped in the fens and Vordai exacts a price for showing them the way out. She insists that Belgarath gives the fenlings (small otter-like creatures) the power of speech as she knew she wouldn&#x27;t be around much longer to protect them. Garion is immediately alarmed, for fear that Belgarath has lost his power but by the time he tells Vordai it is too late. After conferring with the spirit of Aldur, Belgarath gives the fenlings the power to talk and it was only later when Garion realises that even he could have used sorcery to find their way out of the fens that Belgarath had done it out of compassion. Any thoughts of Belgarath losing his power are forever dispelled at that moment.

They then head towards Boktor where they confer with Porenn and Silk meets his mother who was once one of the great beauties of Drasnia. She was tragically blinded and marred by a vicious plague some 20 years earlier and visiting her was very hard on Silk who sees the blinding as half a blessing as his mother can no longer look on her face and see how scarred it became after the plague had left her disfigured. 

Meanwhile, upon discovery of Garion, Belgarath and Silk&#x27;s departure, Polgara enters a rage, which devastates her apartment and causes a thunderstorm overhead. Ce&#x27;Nedra too, feeling humiliated and taking it personally, has her own tantrum before calming down. She then discovers the power of Beldaran&#x27;s necklace and, having learnt the reason for Garion&#x27;s departure, she raises an international army to distract the Angaraks from Garion&#x27;s quest so that he may reach Cthol Mishrak safely and overcome Torak.

=== &quot;Enchanters&#x27; End Game&quot; ===

The final book of the series starts with Belgarion, Silk, and Belgarath sneaking through Gar og Nadrak on their way to Mallorea. In the opening chapters they are accompanied first by a Drasnian trader and then later by an old man who lives a hermit like existence in the forests. He warns them that Mallorean recruiters are forcibly enlisting people into the army for the forthcoming war. Soon they come across a mining town and have a conversation with a local Nadrak who tells of a &quot;Queen&quot; raising an army in the west. Garion is incredulous and even wonders if it was Polgara. Soon afterwards Mallorean recruiters arrive and the three of them manage to get out just in time - unlike their new Nadrak friend.

As they continue on their quest the three of them enter the Nadrak forest and Garion comes to see that he understands the language of wolves even in his human form. Soon they stop off in a small town. It is only worthy of a mention because it is here that they come across Vella for the first time, a Nadrak woman, who later becomes an important secondary character as she gets to know Yarblek and then later on, in the Mallorean, Beldin. Due to Silk being recognised as a wanted man they soon have to flee with a pack of wolves, one of which Garion had not long met and conversed with, putting the trackers off.

As they carry on eastwards they are ambushed in a tavern and Garion and Silk are forcibly enlisted into the Mallorean army. Belgarath somehow manages to escape. En route to Thull Zelik, the Mallorean army&#x27;s staging post, the recruiters and their hapless prisoners are met my Yarblek the Nadrak who quickly disposes of the Malloreans before telling Garion and Silk that he is under orders from Drosta lek Thun, the King of the Nadraks to deliver Silk to him.

With Belgarath still nowhere in sight, Garion and Silk travel with Yarblek to Yar Nadrak, the capital, where they meet Drosta in some run down squalid inn. Just before they meet Drosta they see Belgarath apparently drunk in a corner of the inn with his head down.

Drosta is looking for a way out of the war and freedom from Mallorean domination and he asks for help, or to at least get a message to Rhodar before Belgarath bursts in and rapidly moves things along. Then, realising who Garion is, Drosta lets them continue on their journey.

They are tracked by Malloreans who follow them out of Yar Nadrak, but they manage to stay well ahead of them. However, under such pressure they decide to turn north and go across Morindland to the land bridge between the two continents rather than continue as they originally intended. Just as they decided Beldin pays them a visit and updates them on what is happening in the West and the current strategy that aims to get the Cherek fleet into the Sea of the East to stop the Malloreans from flooding in. Belgarath is deeply unhappy as he realises that such a strategy could backfire and &#x27;Zakath will use the very land bridge he intends to use to get to Cthol Mishrak and thus block their passage. Beldin also delivers the news that the Orb will restore Torak&#x27;s marred face. 

They get across Morindland, after fighting off a challenge from an other clan.

Then as they finally get across to Mallorea, Garion is tempted by Torak to accept him as a father and Polgara as his mother, but rejects this offer and reaches Cthol Mishrak unchallenged.

Ce&#x27;Nedra&#x27;s army invades Angarak lands, and wins a hard-fought Battle at Thull Mardu with both physical and magical powers employed by both sides. However, in the moment of victory Ce&#x27;Nedra, Polgara, Durnik, and Errand are captured by the emperor Zakath of Mallorea, who gives them to Zedar to offer to Torak. &quot;En route&quot; to Cthol Mishrak, Polgara reveals that the Mallorean Prophecies identify her as Torak&#x27;s fiancée, and that her resistance to Torak&#x27;s call may decide Belgarion&#x27;s duel. Zedar takes his prisoners to Torak&#x27;s chamber, where Zedar kills Durnik, enraging Belgarath, who buries him alive. Torak attempts to sway Polgara; but Garion sends images of Durnik into her mind, thereby helping her to withstand Torak&#x27;s call. A final battle ensues, during which Garion and Torak swell into immensity, and in which Garion, having &#x27;rejected&#x27; Torak again, kills him outright. The other gods claim Torak&#x27;s body, and UL, revealed as the father of the gods, agrees to allow Garion to revive Durnik; Mara objects, but relents when Belgarath reveals the existence of Taiba.

Upon the company&#x27;s return to Riva, Garion and Ce&#x27;Nedra plan their wedding, while Polgara and Durnik are married in a private chapel in the Citadel. Here, Durnik reveals that he received the &quot;Will and the Word&quot; when he was brought back to life, and that Belgarath had been training him to control the &quot;will and the word&quot;. Ce&#x27;Nedra and Garion are married, dance with everyone, and retire to their chambers. The story ends with a half-drunk Belgarath having a conversation with the Orb, while Garion and Ce&#x27;Nedra consummate their marriage.

== Reception and impact ==
The series was a bestseller and an instant sensation. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; in their review of &quot;The Rivan Codex&quot; (1998) called &quot;The Belgariad&quot; &quot;one of the founding megasagas in modern English-language fantasy.&quot; The Guardian credited Eddings with creating &quot;the craze for doorstopper-sized fantasy series&quot;. The series was published in a transitional period for fantasy literature, when the genre was becoming more &quot;complex and nuanced,&quot; and the Eddings books were a sort of &quot;last gasp&quot; of popularity for traditional fantasy. Stephen Hunt said the books &quot;were fantasy, but they carried a modern feel to the dialogue and characterisation, while still being firmly placed in a deeply believable fantasy world.&quot; 

Jason Heller wrote a retrospective on the series for NPR in 2017 after re-reading the books as an adult ~30 years after reading them originally. He found the archetypical fantasy aspects had aged reasonably well despite his expectations that the tropes might feel worn out, and noted the story&#x27;s very direct use of the hero&#x27;s journey from Joseph Campbell. Heller did find that the gender roles had aged poorly, though: 

Heller also felt that the series uncritically mirrored the real-life East–West dichotomy, and that this aspect also bothered him as an adult. The protagonists are largely fair-skinned good guys in the West, while the antagonists of the series are from the kingdoms of the East and &quot;systematically sinister or congenitally stupid.&quot;

<text>The Malloreon is a five-part fantasy book series written by David Eddings, which follows &quot;The Belgariad&quot;. The Malloreon is set in the same world as The Belgariad, but expands on several aspects of the setting, especially the eastern continent of Mallorea.

== Works in the series ==
# &quot; ()
# &quot; ()

While the story concludes in The Malloreon, minor events occur in the prequels &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;Polgara the Sorceress&quot;, which otherwise cover the history of the world.

=== &quot;Guardians of the West&quot; ===
At the end of &quot;The Belgariad&quot;, Garion has slain the evil god Torak and expects lasting peace. The first half of the book concentrates on the first eight years of Belgarion&#x27;s reign, describing minor problems including Queen Ce&#x27;Nedra&#x27;s seeming infertility and a civil war in Arendia. All of these problems are resolved without much trouble, their resolutions providing some comic relief. The book also depicts the life of Errand, Polgara&#x27;s ward. During his years under her care, Errand displays near-omniscience; this puzzles Polgara and Belgarath. During the same years, Errand encounters a lesson learned telepathically from an ancient tree and two contacts with people important to his destiny. The inciting action of the story occurs when Garion and Errand are both summoned by the Orb of Aldur, and the Voice of Prophecy warns them &quot;Beware Zandramas!&quot;. Thereafter Garion and Belgarath seek to discover the identity and purpose of Zandramas through records of ancient, dubious prophecies. Ultimately, Garion learns that he is still a figure of prophecy and bears the responsibility of defeating Torak&#x27;s successor, the &quot;Child of Dark&quot;.

Subsequent to Garion&#x27;s discovery, his regent Brand is murdered by assassins sent to kill Ce&#x27;Nedra and her newborn son Geran. The assassins are traced to the Bear-Cult, a legion of ethnocentric fanatics dedicated to reunification of the empire divided among the sons of Garion&#x27;s ancestor King Cherek. In response, Garion and other descendants of Cherek destroy the Bear-Cult, but are unable to prevent the abduction of Prince Geran. When the cult rising is put down, it is revealed that the leader of the cultists is the priest/sorcerer Harakan, a servant of Torak&#x27;s disciple Urvon. Harakan escapes shortly after the revelation of his true identity.

The military leaders are later visited by the clairvoyant Cyradis, who reveals that Geran&#x27;s kidnapping was carried out by Zandramas, the new Child of Dark, and that Garion must recover him with the help of Belgarath, Polgara, Ce&#x27;Nedra, Errand, Durnik, and Silk; but shall later acquire the Huntress (a Drasnian spy named Liselle or Velvet), the Man Who Is No Man (the eunuch Sadi), the Empty One (Mallorean Emperor Zakath), the Silent Man (Cyradis&#x27; bodyguard Toth) and the Woman Who Watches (Belgarath&#x27;s wife Poledra). With these companions he must travel to the Place Which Is No More for the final meeting between Light and Dark that will decide the fate of the world. When all objections are overcome, the company assembles and departs.

=== &quot;King of the Murgos&quot; ===

In this book, Belgarion and his fellow travelers learn more about the murderous woman Zandramas and of her minion, a white-eyed Angarak named Naradas. During their stay in Nyissa they recruit Sadi, a eunuch expelled from Queen Salmissra&#x27;s court. Sadi convinces the group to pose as slavers searching for escaped runaways as the Mallorean army ravages Cthol Murgos. When they enter the wastelands of Cthol Murgos, they are captured by the desert-dwelling Dagashi and given the task of secreting an assassin through the Mallorean army lines. Eventually, they arrive in the palace of the King of the Murgos, Urgit, and discover, to Kheldar&#x27;s surprise, that his father had sired the Murgo King while on a diplomatic mission many years before.

Urgit, upon learning that Kheldar is his half-brother, arranges for the group to travel south to the Isle of Verkat. Before they leave the city, they find that the Dagashi assassin is in fact Harakan. Garion and Harakan duel with swords until Harakan realizes he is about to lose and resorts to sorcery to save himself. The group then sails south. En route, their ship wrecks and they must travel to the coast on foot. On the coast, Toth tells them that Cyradis has arranged a boat to take them to the island. On the island, they are directed to Ashaba, Torak&#x27;s ruined castle. Before they can leave the island, Mallorean soldiers come looking for them, and Cyradis, who must abet both Necessities equally, tells Toth to alert the guards to their presence. The book ends with the company being sent to Emperor Zakath&#x27;s Imperial Stronghold.

=== &quot;Demon Lord of Karanda&quot; ===

At the beginning of this chapter, Belgarion and his fellow travellers are brought to Mallorea. There Belgarion meets Kal Zakath, the Mallorean emperor bent on destroying the Murgos&#x27; royal family. Gradually, Zakath and Garion become friends. When a sudden plague spreads, necessitating quarantine, the questing party escape the city so as to continue their journey. In escape, they are joined by the jester Feldegast (actually Belgarath&#x27;s &#x27;brother&#x27; Beldin in disguise), with whom they approach Ashaba. Problems arise when they confirm the report of demons under the Demon Lord Nahaz, who has turned the sorcerer Urvon insane.

Reaching Ashaba, Garion is tricked into believing that he sees Zandramas and his son meeting with Urvon and charges into the throne room. Beldin, on seeing Urvon and his man Harakan, assumes his true form; this starts a battle with Urvon&#x27;s forces, which ultimately results in Harakan&#x27;s death. Nahaz faces the group of sorcerers and the Orb, ready to fight; but when Eriond comes to stand with Garion, the Demon Lord flees, carrying Urvon with him. The group then continues east. Travelling through the demon-infested countryside, and seeing horrors such as women impregnated by demons (the births usually resulting in the mother&#x27;s death), the group encounters Zandramas, who attempts to coerce Ce&#x27;Nedra within killing distance, until Poledra, Polgara&#x27;s mother and Belgarath&#x27;s wife, forces Zandramas to retreat.

=== &quot;Sorceress of Darshiva&quot; ===
The party enters the Melcene Empire, where they discover that the Sardion, the moral opposite of the Orb of Aldur, was once kept in an undersea cave where traces of its power still resonate. Upon reaching the University at Melcena, Belgarath finds an unmutilated copy of the Ashabine Oracles, which he has sought, and decides that the party must go to Kell to learn of the location of &quot;The Place That Is No More&quot;. Garion, in the same book, sees that in his sole moment of sanity, Torak specifically addressed Belgarion, demanding that if need be he should destroy the world, even kill his own son, rather than let Zandramas complete her plans. This reflects a similar warning made by Cyradis in &quot;Guardians of the West&quot;. Having achieved this knowledge, the group return to Mallorea and travel overland. At some point thereafter, a suggestion is made that Torak&#x27;s existence was an aberration and that another God shall appear to take his place.

The party is recaptured by Zakath, who threatens to take Garion back to Mal Zeth with his companions as collateral. At Beldin&#x27;s request, Cyradis persuades him to release the party, offering herself as a hostage; Zakath does so and joins their quest. Shortly thereafter, Poledra joins them in the guise of a wolf, bringing an orphaned cub later domesticated by Ce&#x27;Nedra. Her identity is concealed from both characters and reader until the next book.

Urvon&#x27;s Karand army under Nahaz and Zandramas&#x27; Darshivan army eventually engage each other in battle, as do Urvon&#x27;s Demon Lord Nahaz and Zandramas&#x27; Demon Lord Mordja. The demons go after Garion&#x27;s group, sensing the Orb&#x27;s presence, but Aldur infuses Durnik with his own powers, and he defeats and banishes Nahaz. Aldur, before leaving, informs Belgarath, Beldin, and Polgara that Durnik is &quot;also my beloved Disciple, as he was the best suited of ye&quot;. An amulet shaped in the likeness of a sledgehammer (the only one made by Aldur without the aid of Belgarath) is then bestowed upon the smith.

=== &quot;The Seeress of Kell&quot; ===

The group continues to Kell, where they meet with Cyradis. As promised, the Seeress surrenders herself to Zakath, and directs the others to Perivor, an island to the southwest of the Mallorean continent. Garion&#x27;s party and Zandramas&#x27;s servant Naradas attempt to find maps in Perivor, a kingdom of shipwrecked Mimbrates, that point the way to the Place Which Is No More. Naradas, disguised as a court minister, delays Garion with red-herring quests, whereafter Sadi poisons him. With the aid of a Necromancer, they expose his treachery to the King and find an ancient map on which Place Which is No More is the &#x27;High Places of Korim&#x27;, an ancient temple of Torak. There, they confront Zandramas. A battle ensues against her Grolim priests, as well as the demon Mordja. Mordja kills the blindfolded Seeress&#x27;s guide Toth; but Garion slays the demon with his ancestral sword.

The group then accompanies Zandramas into the Sardion&#x27;s resting place, where Zandramas chooses Geran as the next Child of Dark, whereupon Garion chooses Eriond as the next Child of Light. Cyradis, still grieving over the loss of Toth and unable to consult her people, is terrified of making the wrong choice, until Polgara removes her blindfold. Receiving a final challenge from Zandramas, Cyradis ultimately chooses Eriond, whereupon Zandramas and the Sardion are changed into stars and transported into outer space.

The Voice of Prophecy explains that the events of the preceding books were the result of an ancient &#x27;accident&#x27; in space, that resulted in the Light and Dark prophecies, and that Eriond, the final Child of the Light, is now the God of Angarak. Zakath&#x27;s personal guard soon arrives on the Imperial ship. In the harbor, Barak, Lelldorin, Mandorallen, and Hettar arrive in Barak&#x27;s ship, with Barak&#x27;s son Unrak tied to the ship&#x27;s mast. Here, it is revealed that Unrak is his father&#x27;s successor to the position of the Rivan King&#x27;s guardian, the Dreadful Bear. The sorcerers honor the fallen Toth by populating his funeral slab with eternally growing flowers and sealing off the section of Mount Korim with glowing quartz as his tomb.

After leaving Eriond, Zakath, and Cyradis, the adventurers return home in Barak&#x27;s ship, where it is revealed that both Ce&#x27;Nedra and Polgara are pregnant. The story ends with Garion reading a letter from Zakath, showing that Zakath has now married Cyradis and is witness to the social changes wrought by Eriond, while Garion, Belgarath, and Durnik are in the Vale of Aldur, as Polgara gives birth to twins. This birth is theorized as the first &quot;new&quot; event in their world&#x27;s history.

<doc id="53207" wikidata="Q183945" url="?curid=53207" title="Record producer">
<text>A record producer or music producer is a music creating project&#x27;s overall supervisor whose responsibilities can involve a range of creative and technical leadership roles. Typically the job involves hands-on oversight of recording sessions; ensuring artists deliver acceptable and quality performances, supervising the technical engineering of the recording, and coordinating the production team and process. The producer&#x27;s involvement in a musical project can vary in depth and scope. Sometimes in popular genres the producer may create the recording&#x27;s entire sound and structure. However, in classical music recording, for example, the producer serves as more of a liaison between the conductor and the engineering team. The role is often likened to that of a film director though there are important differences. It is distinct from the role of an executive producer, who is mostly involved in the recording project on an administrative level, and from the audio engineer who operates the recording technology.

Varying by project, the producer may or may not choose all of the artists. If employing only synthesized or sampled instrumentation, the producer may be the sole artist. Conversely, some artists do their own production. Some producers are their own engineers, operating the technology across the project: preproduction, recording, mixing, and mastering. Record producers&#x27; precursors were &quot;A&amp;R men&quot;, who likewise could blend entrepreneurial, creative, and technical roles, but often exercised scant creative influence, as record production still focused, into the 1950s, on simply improving the record&#x27;s sonic match to the artists&#x27; own live performance.

Advances in recording technology, especially the 1940s advent of tape recording—which Les Paul promptly innovated further to develop multitrack recording—and the 1950s rise of electronic instruments, turned record production into a specialty. In popular music, then, producers like George Martin, Phil Spector and Brian Eno led its evolution into its present use of elaborate techniques and unrealistic sounds, creating songs impossible to originate live. After the 1980s, production&#x27;s move from analog to digital further expanded possibilities. By now, DAWs, or digital audio workstations, like Logic Pro, Pro Tools and Studio One, turn an ordinary computer into a production console, whereby a solitary novice can become a skilled producer in a thrifty home studio. In the 2010s, efforts began to increase the prevalence of producers and engineers who are women, heavily outnumbered by men and prominently accoladed only in classical music.
== Production overview ==

As a broad project, the creation of a popular music recording may be split across three specialists: the executive producer, who oversees business partnerships and financing; the vocal producer or vocal arranger, who aids vocal performance via expert critique and coaching of vocal technique, and the record producer or music producer, who, often called simply the producer, directs the overall creative process of recording the song in its final mix.

The producer&#x27;s roles can include gathering ideas, composing music, choosing session musicians, proposing changes to song arrangements, coaching the performers, controlling sessions, supervising the audio mixing, and, in some cases, supervising the audio mastering. A producer may give creative control to the artists themselves, taking a supervisory or advisory role instead. As to qualifying for a Grammy nomination, the Recording Academy defines a producer:

The person who has overall creative and technical control of the entire recording project, and the individual recording sessions that are part of that project. He or she is present in the recording studio or at the location recording and works directly with the artist and engineer. The producer makes creative and aesthetic decisions that realize both the artist&#x27;s and label&#x27;s goals in the creation of musical content. Other duties include, but are not limited to: keeping budgets and schedules; adhering to deadlines; hiring musicians, singers, studios, and engineers; overseeing other staffing needs; and editing (Classical projects).

The producer often selects and collaborates with a mixing engineer, who focuses on the especially technological aspects of the recording process, namely, operating the electronic equipment and blending the raw, recorded tracks of the chosen performances, whether vocal or instrumental, into a &quot;mix&quot;, either stereo or surround sound. Then a mastering engineer further adjusts this recording for distribution on the chosen media. A producer may work on only one or two songs or on an artist&#x27;s entire album, helping develop the album&#x27;s overall vision. The record producers may also take on the role of executive producer, managing the budget, schedules, contracts, and negotiations.

== Historical developments ==

=== A&amp;R team ===

(Artists and Repertoires)

In the 1880s, the record industry began by simply having the artist perform at a phonograph. In 1924, the trade journal &quot;Talking Machine World&quot;, covering the phonography and record industry, reported that Eddie King, Victor Records&#x27; manager of the &quot;New York artist and repertoire department&quot;, had planned a set of recordings in Los Angeles. Later, folklorist Archie Green called this perhaps the earliest printed use of &quot;A&amp;R man&quot;. Actually, it says neither &quot;A&amp;R man&quot; nor even &quot;A&amp;R&quot;, an initialism perhaps coined by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in 1946, and entering wide use in the late 1940s.

In the 1920s and 1930s, A&amp;R executives, like Ben Selvin at Columbia Records, Nathaniel Shilkret at Victor Records, and Bob Haring at Brunswick Records became the precursors of record producers, supervising recording and often leading session orchestras. During the 1940s, major record labels increasingly opened official A&amp;R departments, whose roles included supervision of recording. Meanwhile, independent recording studios opened, helping originate &quot;record producer&quot; as a specialty. But despite a tradition of some A&amp;R men writing music, &quot;record production&quot; still referred to just the manufacturing of record discs.

=== Record producers ===

After World War II, pioneering A&amp;R managers who transitioned influentially to record production as now understood, while sometimes owning independent labels, include J. Mayo Williams and John Hammond. Upon moving from Columbia Records to Mercury Records, Hammond appointed Mitch Miller to lead Mercury&#x27;s popular recordings in New York. Miller then produced country-pop crossover hits by Patti Page and by Frankie Laine, moved from Mercury to Columbia, and became a leading A&amp;R man of the 1950s.

During the decade, A&amp;R executives increasingly directed songs&#x27; sonic signatures, although many still simply teamed singers with musicians, while yet others exercised virtually no creative influence. The term &quot;record producer&quot; in its current meaning—the creative director of song production—appearing in a 1953 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, became widespread in the 1960s. Still, a formal distinction was elusive for some time more. A&amp;R managers might still be creative directors, like William &quot;Mickey&quot; Stevenson, hired by Berry Gordy, at the Motown record label.

=== Tape recording ===

In 1947, the American market gained audio recording onto magnetic tape. At the record industry&#x27;s 1880s dawn, rather, recording was done by phonograph, etching the sonic waveform vertically &quot;into&quot; a cylinder. By the 1930s, a gramophone etched it laterally &quot;across&quot; a disc. Constrained in tonal range, whether bass or treble, and in dynamic range, records made a grand, concert piano sound like a small, upright piano, and maximal duration was four and a half minutes. Selections and performance were often altered accordingly, and playing this disc—the wax master—destroyed it. The finality often caused anxiety that restrained performance to prevent error. In the 1940s, during World War II, the Germans refined audio recording onto magnetic tape—uncapping recording duration and allowing immediate playback, rerecording, and editing—a technology that premised emergence of record producers in their current roles.

=== Multitrack recording ===

Early in the recording industry, a record was attained by simply having all of the artists perform together live in one take. In 1945, by recording a musical element while playing a previously recorded record, Les Paul developed a recording technique called &quot;sound on sound&quot;. By this, the final recording could be built piece by piece and tailored, effecting an editing process. In one case, Paul produced a song via 500 recorded discs. But, besides the tedium of this process, it serially degraded the sound quality of previously recorded elements, rerecorded as ambient sound. Yet in 1948, Paul adopted tape recording, enabling true multitrack recording by a new technique, &quot;overdubbing&quot;.

To enable overdubbing, Paul revised the tape recorder itself by adding a second playback head, and terming it the &quot;preview head&quot;. Joining the preexisting recording head, erase head, and playback head, the preview head allows the artist to hear the extant recording over headphones playing it in synchrony, &quot;in sync&quot;, with the present performance being recorded alone on an isolated track. This isolation of multiple tracks enables countless mixing possibilities. Producers began recording initially only the &quot;bed tracks&quot;—the rhythm section, including the bassline, drums, and rhythm guitar—whereas vocals and instrument solos could be added later. A horn section, for example, could record a week later, and a string section another week later. A singer could perform her own backup vocals, or a guitarist could play 15 layers.

=== Electronic instruments ===

Across the 1960s, popular music increasingly switched from acoustic instruments, like piano, upright bass, acoustic guitar, and brass instruments, to electronic instruments, like electric guitars, keyboards, and synthesizers, employing instrument amplifiers and speakers. These could mimic acoustic instruments or create utterly new sounds. Soon, by combining the capabilities of tape, multitrack recording, and electronic instruments, producers like Phil Spector, George Martin, and Joe Meek rendered sounds unattainable live. Similarly, in jazz fusion, Teo Macero, producing Miles Davis&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, spliced sections of extensive improvisation sessions.

=== Performer-producer ===
In the 1960s, rock acts like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Kinks produced some of their own songs, although many such songs are officially credited to specialist producers. Yet especially influential was the Beach Boys, whose band leader Brian Wilson took over from his father Murry within a couple of years after the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough. By 1964, Wilson had taken Spector&#x27;s techniques to unseen sophistication. Wilson alone produced all Beach Boys recordings between 1963 and 1967. Using multiple studios and multiple attempts of instrumental and vocal tracks, Wilson selected the best combinations of performance and audio quality, and used tape editing to assemble a composite performance.

=== Digital production ===
The 1980s advent of digital processes and formats rapidly replaced analog processes and formats, namely, tape and vinyl. Although recording onto quality tape, at least half an inch wide and traveling 15 inches per second, had limited &quot;tape hiss&quot; to silent sections, digital&#x27;s higher signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, abolished it. Digital also imparted to the music a perceived &quot;pristine&quot; sound quality, if also a loss of analog recordings&#x27; perceived &quot;warm&quot; quality and better-rounded bass. Yet whereas editing tape media requires physically locating the target audio on the ribbon, cutting there, and splicing pieces, editing digital media offers inarguable advantages in ease, efficiency, and possibilities.

In the 1990s, digital production reached affordable home computers via production software. By now, recording and mixing are often centralized in DAWs, digital audio workstations—for example, Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Ableton, Cubase, Reason, and FL Studio—for which plugins, by third parties, effect virtual studio technology. DAWs fairly standard in the industry are Logic Pro and Pro Tools. Physical devices involved include the main mixer, MIDI controllers to communicate among equipment, the recording device itself, and perhaps effects gear that is outboard. Yet literal recording is sometimes still analog, onto tape, whereupon the raw recording is converted to a digital signal for processing and editing, as some producers still find audio advantages to recording onto tape.

Conventionally, tape is more forgiving of overmodulation, whereby dynamic peaks exceed the maximal recordable signal level: tape&#x27;s limitation, a physical property, is magnetic capacity, which tapers off, smoothing the overmodulated waveform even at a signal nearly 15 decibels too &quot;hot&quot;, whereas a digital recording is ruined by harsh distortion of &quot;clipping&quot; at any overshoot. In digital recording, however, a recent advancement, 32-bit float, enables DAWs to undo clipping. Still, some criticize digital instruments and workflows for excess automation, allegedly impairing creative or sonic control. In any case, as production technology has drastically changed, so have the knowledge demands, although DAWs enables novices, even teenagers at home, to learn production independently. Some have attained professional competence before ever working with an artist.

== Women in producing ==

Among female record producers, Sylvia Moy was the first at Motown, Gail Davies the first on Nashville&#x27;s Music Row, and Ethel Gabriel, with RCA, the first at a major record label. Lillian McMurry, owning Trumpet Records, produced influential blues records. Meanwhile, Wilma Cozart Fine produced hundreds of records for Mercury Records&#x27; classical division. For classical production, three women have won Grammy awards, and Judith Sherman&#x27;s 2015 win was her fifth. Yet in nonclassical, no woman has won Producer of the Year, awarded since 1975 and only one even nominated for a record not her own, Linda Perry. After Lauren Christy&#x27;s 2004 nomination, Linda Perry&#x27;s 2019 nomination was the next for a woman. On why no woman had ever won it, Perry commented, &quot;I just don&#x27;t think there are that many women interested.&quot; In the U.K., Lynsey de Paul was an early female record producer, having produced both of her Ivor Novello award-winning songs.

Across the decades, many female artists have produced their own music. For instance, artists Kate Bush, Madonna, Mariah Carey, Shakira, Janet Jackson, Beyoncé (even that of Destiny&#x27;s Child and the Carters), Lana Del Rey, Taylor Swift, and Lorde have produced or coproduced and Ariana Grande who produces and arranges her vocals as well as being an audio engineer. Still among specialists, despite some prominent women, including Missy Elliott in hip hop and Sylvia Massy in rock, the vast majority have been men. Early in the 2010s, asked for insights that she herself had gleaned as a woman who has specialized successfully in the industry, Wendy Page remarked, &quot;The difficulties are usually very short-lived. Once people realize that you can do your job, sexism tends to lower its ugly head.&quot; Still, when tasked to explain her profession&#x27;s sex disparity, Page partly reasoned that record labels, dominated by men, have been, she said, &quot;mistrustful of giving a woman the reins of an immense, creative project like making a record.&quot; Ultimately, the reasons are multiple and not fully clear, although prominently proposed factors include types of sexism and scarcity of female role models in the profession.

Women producers known for producing records not their own include Sonia Pottinger, Sylvia Robinson and Carla Olson.

In January 2018, a research team led by Stacy L. Smith, founder and director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, based in the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, issued a report, estimating that in the prior several years, about 2% of popular songs&#x27; producers were female. Also that month, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine queried, &quot;Where are all the female music producers?&quot; Upon the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative&#x27;s second annual report, released in February 2019, its department at USC reported, &quot;2018 saw an outcry from artists, executives and other music industry professionals over the lack of women in music&quot; and &quot;the plight of women in music&quot;, where women were allegedly being &quot;stereotyped, sexualized, and shut out&quot;. Also in February 2019, the Recording Academy&#x27;s Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion announced an initiative whereby over 200 artists and producers—ranging from Cardi B and Taylor Swift to Maroon 5 and Quincy Jones—agreed to consider at least two women for each producer or engineer position. The academy&#x27;s website, &quot;Grammy.com&quot;, announced, &quot;This initiative is the first step in a broader effort to improve those numbers and increase diversity and inclusion for all in the music industry.&quot;

<text>Lloyd Chudley Alexander (January 30, 1924 – May 17, 2007) was an American author of more than 40 books, primarily fantasy novels for children and young adults. Over his seven-decade career, Alexander wrote 48 books, and his work has been translated into 20 languages. His most famous work is &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;, a series of five high fantasy novels whose conclusion, &quot;The High King&quot;, was awarded the 1969 Newbery Medal for excellence in American children&#x27;s literature. He won U.S. National Book Awards in 1971 and 1982. 

Alexander grew up in Pennsylvania during the Great Depression. He developed a passion for reading books and writing poetry. He attended college for only one term, believing that there was nothing more college could teach him. He enlisted in the United States Army and rose to be a staff sergeant in intelligence and counter-intelligence. He met his wife while he was stationed in France and studied French literature at the University of Paris. After returning to the United States with his new family, he struggled to make a living from writing until he published &quot;And Let the Credit Go&quot; (1955), his first autobiographical novel. His interest in Welsh mythology led to the publication of &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;. 

Alexander was nominated twice for the international Hans Christian Andersen Award, and received the 1971 National Book Award for Children&#x27;s Books for &quot;The Marvelous Misadventures of Sebastian&quot; and the 1982 National Book Award for &quot;Westmark&quot;. Alexander received three lifetime achievement awards before his death in 2007. The Harold B. Lee Library at Brigham Young University contains a permanent Lloyd Alexander exhibit that showcases several items from his home office including his desk, typewriter, and manuscripts and editions of his books.

==Early life and education==
Alexander was born in Philadelphia on January 30, 1924, to Edna (née Chudley) and Alan Audley Alexander, and grew up in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, a section of Upper Darby, just west of the city. He had an elder sister, Florence. His parents only read newspapers, but they did buy books &quot;at the Salvation Army to fill up empty shelves&quot;. He taught himself to read around age four and skipped grades one and two at a private Quaker school. He and his friends played war, using equipment from World War I in their games. After his father Alan, a stockbroker, bankrupted in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Alexander attended public school, where he skipped yet another grade, entering seventh grade at age nine. Alexander read Shakespeare, Dickens, Mark Twain and myths, especially King Arthur. In addition to being interested in art, at age thirteen, Alexander wanted to become an Episcopal priest; however, his family could not afford to send him to divinity school. Passionate about writing, Alexander believed he could preach and worship God through his writing and his art. In high school, he began writing romantic poetry modeled after the work of nineteenth-century poets and narrative short stories, but he failed to acquire interest from publishers. His parents found him a job as a bank messenger, which inspired a satire that would become his first book published fifteen years later, &quot;And Let the Credit Go&quot; (1955). He graduated at age sixteen in 1940 from Upper Darby High School, where he was inducted into the school&#x27;s Wall of Fame in 1995.

He attended West Chester State Teachers College, which he left after only one term because he did not find the curriculum rigorous enough. After dropping out of college, Alexander worked for six months in the mailroom of the Atlantic Refining Company. Alexander decided that adventure was a better school for a writer than college and enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was too clumsy with artillery to be sent to the front, and the sight of blood made him faint, making him unfit to work as a medic. With no prior musical experience, he briefly played the cymbals in a marching band in Texas. Shortly after, he was transferred to serve as a chaplain&#x27;s assistant. He had the opportunity to study the French language, politics, customs, and geography at Lafayette College through the army. He was later moved to Camp Ritchie, Maryland, to receive specialized intelligence training in the United States Army Combat Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence Corps. At Camp Ritchie, Alexander rose to the rank of Staff Sergeant. There he met war veterans, scholars, refugees, and members of the Cherokee tribe. He rose to be a staff sergeant in the corps. 

Alexander was stationed in Wales and England briefly and then was assigned to the 7th army in eastern France where he translated radio messages for six months. His next assignment was the Paris office of the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) where he worked as a translator and an interpreter until the end of 1945. After the war, Alexander attended the University of Paris where he studied French literature and was fascinated by the poetry of Paul Éluard. Alexander called Éluard on the phone and showed him his English translations of Éluard&#x27;s work. Éluard immediately named Alexander his sole English translator. Alexander also contacted Gertrude Stein, who advised him that becoming a writer was a difficult and discouraging process. In Paris, he met Janine Denni, who had a young daughter named Madeleine. Alexander and Denni were married on January 8, 1946, and soon moved to Philadelphia. The three moved into the attic of his parents&#x27; home where Alexander spent twelve hours a day translating Éluard&#x27;s works and writing his own.

==Writing career==
For about fifteen years in Philadelphia, Alexander wrote primarily fiction, non-fiction, and translations for adults. Desperate for a job, he worked as a potter&#x27;s apprentice for his sister. At the end of 1948, he started writing advertising copy, and he began to receive more royalties for his translations, leading him to purchase a house for his family in Kellytown. However, he lost his job after three months, requiring his wife to take up employment in a textile mill to make ends meet. Alexander continued to write diligently, though no publishers bought his novels for seven years.

One of his short stories, &quot;The Fantastic Symphony&quot; (1949), published in the &quot;New Directions Annual&quot;, was a surrealistic piece inspired by Berlioz&#x27;s notes on the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;. Alexander&#x27;s breakthrough came with his novel &quot;And Let the Credit Go&quot; (1955), his first autobiographical work in which he focused on his experience as a bank messenger in his adolescence. He wrote his second novel, &quot;My Five Tigers&quot; (1956), about his cats, continuing the trend of writing about subjects familiar to him. He found work as a copyeditor and a cartoonist where he finished his last four adult publications. He wrote two semi-autobiographical novels: &quot;Janine is French&quot; (1959) and &quot;My Love Affair with Music&quot; (1960). Alexander co-authored &quot;Park Avenue Vet&quot; (1960) with Louis Camuti, who specialized in treating cats. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals subsequently commissioned their history, which Alexander wrote as &quot;Fifty Years in the Doghouse&quot; (1964). During that time he wrote two non-fiction books for children, biographies for August Bondi and Aaron Lopez commissioned by the Jewish Publication Society, the former of which won the National Jewish Book Award in 1959. Alexander&#x27;s subsequent novel was his first of the fantasy genre: &quot;Time Cat&quot; (1963). He later called it &quot;the most creative and liberating experience of my life&quot;. The novel imagines a cat who can visit its other lives in different time periods, which Alexander researched extensively. &quot;Fifty Years in the Doghouse&quot; (1964; reprinted as &quot;Send for Ryan&quot;) told stories of how William Michael Ryan saved animals as part of his job as a special agent for the ASPCA.

Almost forty years old, he then specialized in children&#x27;s fantasy, the genre of his best-known works. His wartime tenure in Wales introduced him to castles and scenery that would inspire settings for many of his books. Alexander was particularly fascinated with Welsh mythology, especially the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. The plot for &quot;The Book of Three&quot; is based on a fragment from the &quot;Myvyrian Archaiology&quot;. Alexander signed a book deal with Henry Holt and Company for a trilogy called &quot;The Sons of Llyr&quot;. Alexander resisted simplifying the Welsh names, stating that they gave the book a certain mood and strangeness. After the release of the first novel, &quot;The Book of Three&quot; (1964), the series became known as &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;. The second book of the series, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, followed in 1965. After beginning the third book, &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot; (1966), Alexander decided his story needed to be told in four books, not three, and he planned his fourth and final novel, &quot;The High King of Prydain&quot;. During this time he also worked at the &quot;Delaware Valley Announcer&quot; as an associate editor. After having a near-death experience, Alexander hastily finished &quot;The High King&quot;, concerned he would be unable to finish his saga. However, his editor, Ann Durell, suggested that he write a fourth book in between &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot; and &quot;The High King&quot; (1968); this book became &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; (1967). The five novels detail the adventures of a young man named Taran, who dreams of being a sword-bearing hero but has only the title of Assistant Pig-Keeper. He progresses from youth to maturity and must finally choose whether to be High King of Prydain. Alexander also wrote two spin-off children&#x27;s books from the Prydain series, &quot;Coll and His White Pig&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Truthful Harp&quot; (1967). Alexander won the Newbery Medal for &quot;The High King&quot; in 1969. 

Alexander&#x27;s novel &quot;The Marvelous Misadventures of Sebastian&quot; (1970) was rejected after its first submission, and he rewrote it three times before it was published. It won the National Book Award in 1971. He published two picture books: &quot;The King&#x27;s Fountain&quot; (1971), for which he collaborated with the author Ezra Jack Keats, and &quot;The Four Donkeys&quot; (1972). He wrote the novel &quot;The Cat Who Wished to be a Man&quot; in 1973. The same year Alexander published &quot;The Foundling: And Other Tales of Prydain&quot;, a companion book to the Prydain series. After the success of &quot;Prydain&quot;, Alexander was author-in-residence at Temple University from 1970 to 1974. He once described it as being educational for him and &quot;rather like being a visiting uncle, who has a marvelous time with his nephews and nieces, then goes off leaving the parents to cope with attacks of whooping cough, mending socks and blackmailing the kids to straighten up the mess in their rooms.&quot; Alexander wrote &quot;The Wizard in the Tree&quot; while suffering from depression and published it in 1975. The character Arbican was based on Alexander and his personal struggles. In 1977 he published &quot;The Town Cats&quot;, which received a more favorable critical reception than &quot;The Wizard in the Tree&quot;. His next book, &quot;The First Two Lives of Lukas-Kasha&quot;, set in a fantasy world based on 15th century Persia, was published in 1978. It won the Silver Slate Pencil Award in Holland and the Austrian Book Award in Austria.

Alexander&#x27;s other fiction series are &quot;Westmark&quot; (1981 to 1984) and &quot;Vesper Holly&quot; (1987 to 1990 and 2005). &quot;Westmark&quot; features a former printer&#x27;s apprentice involved in the rebellion and civil war in a fictional European kingdom around 1800. Vesper Holly is a wealthy and brilliant Philadelphia orphan who has adventures in various fictional countries during the 1870s. There was some controversy about &quot;The Fortune-Tellers&quot; (1992), a picture book illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman. Some felt that the story was European in origin and therefore inappropriate for its African setting. Alexander&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Golden Dream of Carlo Chuchio&quot;, was published in August 2007. 

Alexander helped create the children&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;Cricket&quot; and served on its editorial board. He served on the library committee of &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot; in 1974 and in the board of directors in the Friends of the International Board on Books for Young People in 1982. Alexander maintained a rigorous working schedule, awakening at 4 a.m. and working until the late afternoon, afterwards enjoying his sole meal with his wife. He adhered to this routine even when he did not feel inspired, stating that he could not rely on inspiration alone. He corresponded with fans, who on occasion visited him in his home.

Alexander died on May 17, 2007, of cancer, a few weeks after the death of his wife of sixty-one years. His stepdaughter, Madeleine Khalil, had predeceased both him and her mother in 1995. He was survived by his five step-grandchildren and five step-great-grandchildren. He is buried at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill.

==Themes and style==
The Prydain Chronicles are set in a fantasy world that has much in common with Welsh folklore and mythology. Critics called the chronicles &quot;one of the most important and compelling examples of Welsh mythopoesis to date.&quot; According to &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot;, Alexander&#x27;s books had &quot;the special depth and insight provided by characters who not only act but think, feel and struggle with the same kinds of problems that confuse and trouble people in the twentieth century.&quot; Some Arthurian scholars argue that Alexander took too many liberties with the material, creating works that are &quot;too contemporary&quot;. Alexander described his own writings as based on myth, but written with his personal life experience, or &quot;micromythology&quot;. C. W. Sullivan, a professor of Northern European mythology at East Carolina University, stated that Alexander took the structure of a fairy tale, or &quot;märchen&quot;, and added Welsh details. Brian Attebery wrote that &quot;The Book of Three&quot; was &quot;no more than a clever imitation of Tolkien&quot;, but noted that Taran, written by an American, finds his identity in the future, not the past. Attebery described Alexander&#x27;s mythopoeism as a &quot;modest&quot; success, bringing his own creativity to Welsh mythology. Mark Oziewicz, a professor specializing in young adult fantasy, wrote that the Prydain Chronicles show the importance of connecting the present to the past. Taran learns firsthand the importance of stories when he encounters the characters from them, who are often nothing like he imagined. Throughout the series, he must trust the knowledge of authority figures when he takes on quests he does not initially understand. The gradual transformation of Prydain from magical to mundane mirrors Taran&#x27;s coming-of-age. The way the series starts in the past but comments on the future is reminiscent of Welsh &quot;hanesion&quot; narrative, which returns to the past in order to heal the present. Alexander&#x27;s biographer, Jill May, along with critic Normal Bagnall, noted several American themes in the Prydain series: that leadership is an ability, not inherited, and that anyone can become a hero. Bagnall further elucidated that Taran&#x27;s character development was American, with him growing from an inarticulate, self-conscious teen into a self-educated, self-sacrificing adult. In contrast, Kath Filmer-Davies from the University of Queensland argues that the Welshness of the Prydain Chronicles is responsible for much of their appeal. She noted that in Welsh culture, Taran&#x27;s knowledge and nationalism are more important than his non-noble family status.

Alexander&#x27;s works are usually coming-of-age novels in fantasy settings where characters fulfill quests. The main characters are common people who return to their regular lives after their quests. While his settings are inspired by fairy tales and legends, his stories are modern. Self-acceptance and awareness are vital for the protagonists to grow. Alexander&#x27;s works are fundamentally optimistic about human nature, with endings that are hopeful rather than tragic. He stated that in his fantasy world, &quot;good is ultimately stronger than evil&quot; and &quot;courage, justice, love, and mercy actually function&quot;. The Prydain Chronicles deal with themes of good and evil and what it means to be a hero. The Westmark Trilogy also explores good and evil and shows how corrupt leadership can lead to unrest and revolution. The main character, Mickle, reluctantly joins the army in an unexpected war, subverting typical war heroics. The books are appealing adventure stories that simultaneously discuss ethical issues, a quality that critic Hazel Rochman praised in &quot;School Library Journal&quot;. Writing at &quot;The Horn Book&quot;, Mary M. Burns stated that &quot;The Illyrian Adventure&quot; was excellent because it was believable while being a fantasy and had a strong underlying theme. Alexander himself remarked that his &quot;own concerns and questions&quot; still came out in his fiction. He consciously used fantasy stories as a way to understand reality.

Alexander strove to create women characters who were more than a passive trophy for the hero. Rodney Fierce, a history professor, analyzes Eilonwy&#x27;s agency and character over the five books in the Prydain Chronicles. While she is independent and assertive in &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, other characters view her adventuring in &quot;The High King&quot; as unladylike, consistently dismissing her useful advice. Taran only becomes attracted to her when she is wearing fancy feminine clothes, while Eilonwy&#x27;s affections do not rely on Taran being luxuriously accoutered. In &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot;, Taran commands her not to leave the castle but cannot tell her why, leaving readers to feel that his controlling behavior is noble. His secrecy is only vital to make Eilonwy a helpless victim, which will allow Taran to rescue her. In fighting the enchantress who conquered her ancestral home in Caer Colur, Eilonwy destroys her and the castle that would rightfully be hers. After the destruction of her home castle, Eilonwy&#x27;s desire shifts from being focused on her own development to waiting to marry Taran. Even though Taran decides he would rather stay in Prydain than be with Eilonwy, Eilonwy gives up her magical power to marry Taran and stay with him in Prydain. Fierce concludes that, unlike other women in fantasy fiction, at least Eilonwy made the decision herself to lose her magical powers. Sullivan noted how Taran&#x27;s rise to power symbolizes an &quot;age of male dominance&quot;, contrasting Prydain&#x27;s previous age of women in power. In 1985, Lois Kuznets argued that the Prydain chronicles do not achieve American ideals because Taran becomes a king rather than a president, and Eilonwy does not &quot;achieve womanhood&quot;. Alexander&#x27;s biographer, Jill May, rebutted this argument, stating that when Alexander wrote the books in the 1960s, his audience was just beginning to accept feminist ideas, and his works need to be considered in their historical context. One critic, John Rowe Townsend, disliked the &quot;two-dimensional&quot; and &quot;predictable&quot; characters of Taran and Eilonwy.

Several critics have commented on Alexander&#x27;s writing style. In a &quot;Horn Book&quot; review of the Vesper Holly books, Ethel L. Heins stated that Alexander&#x27;s writing was &quot;elegant, witty, [and] beautifully paced&quot;. Reviewers praised the action scenes in the Prydain chronicles, stating that they involved the reader in the scene without gruesome detail. Jill P. May stated that his prose changes depending on the goal of his work. While his fantasy style has been compared to J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, his later writings have a completely different style. His first work for children, a biography of Jewish freedom fighter August Bondi, had little dialogue, perhaps in an effort to be faithful to historical sources. The fictional characters stood out more than Bondi&#x27;s. Alexander wrote another biography for the Jewish Publication Society on Aaron Lopez. In absence of detailed historical sources, Alexander fictionalized more events in this work, with Lopez&#x27;s fictional attitudes mirroring Alexander&#x27;s.

== Awards and honors ==
Alexander first garnered significant critical acclaim with his &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; series. The second volume (&quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;) was a runner-up for the 1966 Newbery Medal; the fourth (&quot;Taran Wanderer&quot;) was a &quot;School Library Journal&quot; Best Book of the Year; the fifth and concluding volume (&quot;The High King&quot;) won the 1969 Newbery. Alexander was included in the 1972 third volume of the H. W. Wilson reference series, &quot;Book of Junior Authors and Illustrators&quot;—early in his career as a children&#x27;s writer, but after &quot;Prydain&quot; was complete. For his contribution as a children&#x27;s writer, Alexander was U.S. nominee in 1996 and again in 2008 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest recognition available to creators of children&#x27;s books. Many of Alexander&#x27;s later books received awards; &quot;The Marvelous Misadventures of Sebastian&quot; won the 1971 National Book Award in category Children&#x27;s Books and in 1982, &quot;Westmark&quot; also won a National Book Award.
&quot;The Fortune-Tellers&quot;, illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman, won the 1992
Boston Globe–Horn Book Award in the Picture Book category. The American Library Association selected &quot;The Beggar Queen&quot; as one of the best books for young adults in 1984, and &quot;The Illyrian Adventure&quot; as a &quot;notable book&quot; in 1986. 
He received at least three lifetime achievement awards.
In 1991, the Free Library of Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Center for the Book awarded him the Pennbook Lifetime Achievement Award.
In 2001, he received the inaugural Parents&#x27; Choice Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award.
In 2003, Alexander received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement.

On January 28, 2010, an exhibit opened at the Harold B. Lee Library on the campus of Brigham Young University, displaying several items from Alexander&#x27;s home office, which he referred to as &quot;the Box&quot;. Items include manuscripts, editions of all his books, his violin, typewriter, and desk. On October 19, 2012, a documentary chronicling the life and writings of Alexander was released. The film is titled &quot;Lloyd Alexander&quot;. On September 23, 2014, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the series, Henry Holt published a special &quot;50th Anniversary Edition&quot; of &quot;The Book of Three&quot;.

<text>Marion Eleanor Zimmer Bradley (June 3, 1930 – September 25, 1999) was an American author of fantasy, historical fantasy, science fiction, and science fantasy novels and is best known for the Arthurian fiction novel &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; and the &quot;Darkover&quot; series. She was noted for the feminist perspective in her writing. 

Bradley began writing at the age of 17 and later graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hardin-Simmons University. She co-founded the Society for Creative Anachronism in 1966. She also served as the editor of the long-running &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot; anthology series. She was posthumously awarded the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 2000.

Though Bradley remained popular during her lifetime, her reputation was posthumously marred when in 2014 her daughter reported that Bradley had sexually abused her, and allegedly assisted her second husband, convicted child abuser Walter Breen, in his own grooming and sexual abuse of multiple unrelated children. Many science fiction authors have since publicly condemned Bradley.

== Personal life ==

Born Marion Eleanor Zimmer on June 3, 1930, she lived on a farm in Albany, New York, and began writing at the age of 17. She was married to Robert Alden Bradley from October 26, 1949, until their divorce on May 19, 1964. They had a son, David Robert Bradley (1950–2008). During the 1950s she was introduced to lesbian advocacy organization the Daughters of Bilitis.

After her divorce, Bradley married numismatist Walter H. Breen on June 3, 1964. They had a daughter, Moira Greyland, who is a professional harpist and singer, and a son, Mark Greyland. Moira&#x27;s son, RJ Stern, is a college football player who was featured on season 5 of &quot;Last Chance U&quot; on Netflix.

In 1965, Bradley graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas. Afterward, she moved to Berkeley, California, to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley between 1965 and 1967. In 1966, with her brother Paul Edwin Zimmer, she helped found and name the Society for Creative Anachronism and was involved in developing several local groups, some in New York after her move to Staten Island. In particular, she and Breen founded and served as the first directors for the Kingdom of the East.

Bradley and Breen separated in 1979 but remained married. They also continued a business relationship and lived on the same street for over a decade. They officially divorced on May 9, 1990, the year Breen was arrested on child molestation charges after a 13-year-old boy reported that Breen had been molesting him for four years. She had edited Breen&#x27;s book &quot;Greek Love&quot; (published pseudonymously), which was dedicated to her (named simply as &quot;[his] wife&quot;), and in 1965 had contributed an article, &quot;Feminine Equivalents of Greek Love in Modern Literature&quot;, to Breen&#x27;s journal &quot;The International Journal of Greek Love&quot;. She allegedly was told of Breen&#x27;s abuse of a minor by her secretary and &quot;she was extremely upset&quot; and immediately divorced him.

== Literary career ==

=== Early work ===

Bradley stated that when she was a child she enjoyed reading adventure fantasy authors such as Henry Kuttner, Edmond Hamilton, C.L. Moore, and Leigh Brackett, especially when they wrote about &quot;the glint of strange suns on worlds that never were and never would be&quot;. Her first novel and much of her subsequent work show their influence strongly. At 17, she began her first novel &quot;The Forest House&quot;, her retelling of &quot;Norma&quot;; she finished it before her death.

Bradley made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1949 with the short story &quot;Outpost&quot;. &quot;Outpost&quot; was published in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; Vol. 23, No. 12, the December 1949 issue; it had previously appeared in the fanzine &quot;Spacewarp&quot; Vol. 4, No. 3, in December 1948. Her first professional publication was a short story &quot;Women Only&quot;, which appeared in the second (and final) issue of &quot;Vortex Science Fiction&quot; in 1953. Her first published novel-length work was &quot;Falcons of Narabedla&quot;, first published in the May 1957 issue of &quot;Other Worlds&quot;.

=== Gay and lesbian pulp fiction ===

Early in her career, writing as Morgan Ives, Miriam Gardner, John Dexter, and Lee Chapman, Bradley produced several works outside the speculative fiction genre, including gay and lesbian pulp fiction novels; &quot;I Am a Lesbian&quot; was published in 1962. Though relatively tame by today&#x27;s standards, her novels were considered pornographic when published.

=== Darkover ===

Her 1958 novel &quot;The Planet Savers&quot; introduced the planet of Darkover, which became the setting of a popular series by Bradley and other authors. The Darkover milieu is a science fantasy fictional world, with science fiction as well as fantasy overtones: Darkover is a lost human colony where psi powers developed to an unusual degree, and work like magic, while technology has regressed to a more-or-less medieval stage. Bradley wrote many Darkover novels by herself, but in her later years collaborated with other authors for publication; her literary collaborators have continued the series since her death. 

=== Encouraging fan interaction ===

Bradley took an active role in science fiction and fantasy fandom, promoting interaction with professional authors and publishers and making several important contributions to the subculture. In her teens she wrote letters to the pulp magazines of the time, such as the above-mentioned &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;. Starting in the late 1940s and continuing in the 1950s and 1960s, she published her own fanzines, including &quot;Astra&#x27;s Tower&quot;, &quot;Day*Star&quot;, and &quot;Anything Box&quot;. She also co-edited fanzines, including &quot;Ugly Bird&quot; with Redd Boggs, &quot;MEZRAB&quot; with her first husband Robert Bradley, and &quot;Allerlei&quot; with her second husband Walter Breen. Bradley contributed to several other fanzines, including &quot;The Gorgon&quot; and &quot;The Nekromantikon&quot;. 

For many years, Bradley actively encouraged Darkover fan fiction. She encouraged submissions from unpublished authors and reprinted some of it in commercial Darkover anthologies. This ended after a dispute with a fan over an unpublished Darkover novel of Bradley&#x27;s that had similarities to one of the fan&#x27;s stories. As a result, the novel remained unpublished and Bradley demanded the cessation of all Darkover fan fiction.

=== Tolkien fandom ===

In the 1970s, as part of the contemporary wave of enthusiasm for J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional world of Middle-earth, she wrote an essay about Éowyn&#x27;s supposed love for the hero Aragorn called &quot;Of Men, Halflings, and Hero Worship&quot; for the &quot;Astra&#x27;s Tower&quot; fanzine. She also penned two short fanfic stories about Arwen, publishing them in chapbook format. One story, &quot;The Jewel of Arwen&quot; (originally published in a different form in the fanzine &quot;I Palantir&quot; #2, August 1961), appeared in her professional anthology &quot;The Best of Marion Zimmer Bradley&quot; (1985), but was dropped from later reprints. She continued to contribute to different science fiction and fantasy fanzines and magazines throughout her career.

=== Other work ===

In 1966, Bradley became a co-founder of the Society for Creative Anachronism and is credited with coining the name of that group.

Bradley was the editor of the long-running &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot; anthology series, which encouraged submissions of fantasy stories featuring original and non-traditional heroines from young and upcoming authors. Although she particularly encouraged young female authors, she was not averse to including stories from men in her anthologies. Mercedes Lackey was one of many authors who first appeared in the anthologies. Bradley also maintained a large family of writers at her home in Berkeley, California. Following Bradley&#x27;s death, the anthology was edited by Elizabeth Waters and continued until 2019.

Her most famous single novel may be &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, a retelling of the Camelot legend from the point of view of Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar. It grew into a series of books and, like the Darkover series, the later novels are written with or by other authors and have continued to appear since Bradley&#x27;s death.

Bradley was posthumously awarded the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 2000.

==Child sex abuse allegations==
In 2000, shortly after Bradley&#x27;s death, author Stephen Goldin, the stepfather of a boy who had been molested by Walter Breen, started a website claiming that Bradley had been fully aware of her husband&#x27;s crimes and made no effort to report them or protect his victims. However, Elizabeth Waters, Bradley&#x27;s secretary, claimed that she was the first one who told Bradley and that Bradley &quot;was extremely upset&quot; at the news.

In 2014, Moira Greyland, the daughter of Bradley and Breen, accused Bradley of sexual abuse from the age of 3 to 12. In an email to &quot;The Guardian,&quot; Greyland said that she had not spoken out before because &quot;I thought that my mother&#x27;s fans would be angry with me for saying anything against someone who had championed women&#x27;s rights and made so many of them feel differently about themselves and their lives. I didn&#x27;t want to hurt anyone she had helped, so I just kept my mouth shut&quot;.

Greyland also confirmed Goldin&#x27;s statements by saying that Bradley was aware of her husband&#x27;s behavior and chose not to report him. Greyland reported that she was not the only victim and that she was one of the people who reported her father for child molestation, for which he received multiple convictions. 

In December 2017, Bradley&#x27;s daughter published a detailed biography of her mother, including her pedophilia and sexual abuse, in a book entitled &quot;The Last Closet: The Dark Side of Avalon&quot;.

Additionally, according to Greyland, Bradley assisted Breen (her husband at the time) in accessing and abusing multiple unrelated young boys, knowing he was a pedophile who was engaging in sexual contact with children as young as eight. Greyland states that Bradley and her live-in female partner (whom Greyland refers to as her step-mother) both admitted to knowledge of the abuse and purposefully avoided investigating, questioning, or notifying any authorities. Bradley was also accused of attempting to adopt a child whom Breen was interested in sexually.

In response to these allegations, on July 2, 2014, Victor Gollancz Ltd, the publisher of Bradley&#x27;s digital backlist, began donating all income from the sales of Bradley&#x27;s e-books to the charity Save the Children. Janni Lee Simner donated advances and royalties from her two &quot;Darkover&quot; short stories and, at the request of her husband, Larry Hammer, payment for his sale to Bradley&#x27;s magazine, to the American anti-sexual assault organization Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network.

A number of science fiction authors have publicly condemned Bradley. Among the first was John Scalzi, who expressed his horror within a day of the allegations being made public. Hugo Award winner Jim C. Hines wrote that Bradley&#x27;s positive effect on her readers and associates &quot;makes the revelations about Marion Zimmer Bradley protecting a known child rapist and molesting her own daughter and others even more tragic.&quot; G Willow Wilson, who, along with Bradley, is a fellow World Fantasy Award winner, said she was &quot;speechless&quot;. Diana L. Paxson, who collaborated with Bradley on a number of novels and who continued to write novels set in the Avalon Series after Bradley&#x27;s death, said that she was &quot;shocked and appalled to read Moira Greyland&#x27;s posts about her mother... I never personally observed, nor had any reason to suspect, that (Bradley) was abusing either of her children.&quot;

==Religion==
While she was attending the College for Teachers (now University at Albany, SUNY) in Albany, Bradley became involved in Western esoteric tradition. She later completed a Rosicrucian correspondence course.

In the late 1950s or early 1960s, Bradley and Walter H. Breen founded the Aquarian Order of the Restoration based on the work of Dion Fortune. By 1961 she was formally initiating others, including Ramfis S. Firethorn.

Bradley was active in Darkmoon Circle, which was founded in 1978 by several women who were members of her Aquarian Order of the Restoration. Bradley renovated her garage to provide a meeting room for Darkmoon Circle as well as for other local Pagan groups. In 1981 Bradley, Diana L. Paxson, and Elisabeth Waters incorporated the Center for Non-Traditional Religion.

In the 1990s Bradley said she would return to Christianity, telling an interviewer: &quot;I just go regularly to the Episcopalian church ... That pagan thing ... I feel that I&#x27;ve gotten past it. I would like people to explore the possibilities.&quot;

==Death==
After suffering declining health for years, Bradley died at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a heart attack. Her ashes were later scattered at Glastonbury Tor in Somerset, England.

<text>The Bering Strait () is a strait between the Pacific and Arctic oceans, separating the Chukchi Peninsula of the Russian Far East from the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. The present Russia–United States maritime boundary is at 168° 58&#x27; 37&quot; W longitude, slightly south of the Arctic Circle at about 65° 40&#x27; N latitude. The Strait is named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born Russian explorer.

The Bering Strait has been the subject of the scientific theory that humans migrated from Asia to North America across a land bridge known as Beringia when lower ocean levels – a result of glaciers locking up vast amounts of water – exposed a wide stretch of the sea floor, both at the present strait and in the shallow sea north and south of it. This view of how Paleo-Indians entered America has been the dominant one for several decades and continues to be the most accepted one. Numerous successful crossings without the use of a boat have also been recorded since at least the early 20th century.

== Geography and science ==

The Bering Strait is about wide at its narrowest point, between Cape Dezhnev, Chukchi Peninsula, Russia, the easternmost point (169° 39&#x27; W) of the Asian continent and Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska, United States, the westernmost point (168° 05&#x27; W) of the North American continent. Its deepest point is only . It borders the Chukchi Sea (part of the Arctic Ocean) to the north and the Bering Sea to the south. The strait is a unique habitat sparsely populated by the Yupik, Inuit, and Chukchi people who have cultural and linguistic ties to each other.

The strait is thought to have opened 4.8-7.4 million years ago. It is believed that the narrowing of the strait 900,000 years ago could be one of the reasons for increasing the duration of the ice age.

== Expeditions ==

From at least 1562, European geographers thought that there was a Strait of Anián between Asia and North America. In 1648, Semyon Dezhnyov probably passed through the strait, but his report did not reach Europe. Danish-born Russian navigator Vitus Bering entered it in 1728. In 1732, Mikhail Gvozdev crossed it for the first time, from Asia to America. It was visited in 1778 by the third voyage of James Cook.

American vessels were hunting for bowhead whales in the strait by 1847.

In March 1913, Captain Max Gottschalk (German) crossed from the east cape of Siberia to Shishmaref, Alaska, on dogsled via Little and Big Diomede islands. He was the first documented modern voyager to cross from Russia to North America without the use of a boat.

In 1987, swimmer Lynne Cox swam a course between the Diomede Islands from Alaska to the Soviet Union in water during the last years of the Cold War. She was congratulated jointly by American President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

In June and July 1989, three independent teams attempted the first modern sea-kayak crossing of the Bering Strait. The groups were: seven Alaskans, who called their effort &quot;Paddling Into Tomorrow&quot; (i.e. crossing the international dateline); a four-man British expedition, &quot;Kayaks Across the Bering Strait&quot;; and a team of Californians in a three-person baidarka, led by Jim Noyes (who launched his ambitious expedition as a paraplegic). Accompanying the Californians was a film crew in a umiak, a walrus-skin boat traditional to the region; they were filming the 1991 documentary &quot;Curtain of Ice&quot;, directed by John Armstrong.

In March 2006, Briton Karl Bushby and French-American adventurer Dimitri Kieffer crossed the strait on foot, walking across a frozen section in 15 days. They were soon arrested for not entering Russia through a regular port of entry.

August 2008 marked the first crossing of the Bering Strait using an amphibious road-going vehicle. The specially modified Land Rover Defender 110 was driven by Steve Burgess and Dan Evans across the straits on its second attempt following the interruption of the first by bad weather.

In February 2012, a Korean team led by Hong Sung-Taek crossed the straits on foot in six days. They started from Chukotka Peninsula, the east coast of Russia on February 23 and arrived in Wales, the western coastal town in Alaska on February 29.

In July 2012, six adventurers associated with &quot;Dangerous Waters&quot;, a reality adventure show under production, made the crossing on Sea-Doos but were arrested and permitted to return to Alaska on their Sea-Doos after being briefly detained in Lavrentiya, the administrative center of the Chukotsky District. They were treated well and given a tour of the village&#x27;s museum, but not permitted to continue south along the Pacific coast. The men had visas but the western coast of the Bering Strait is a closed military zone.

Between August 4 and 10 (US time), 2013, a team of 65 swimmers from 17 countries performed a relay swim across the Bering Strait, the first such swim in history. They swam from Cape Dezhnev, Russia, to Cape Prince of Wales, United States (roughly , due to the current). They had direct support from the Russian Navy, using one of its ships, and assistance with permission.

== Proposed crossing ==
A physical link between Asia and North America via the Bering Strait nearly became a reality in 1864 when a Russian-American telegraph company began preparations for an overland telegraph line connecting Europe and America via the east. It was abandoned when the undersea Atlantic Cable proved successful.

A further proposal for a bridge-and-tunnel link from eastern Russia to Alaska was made by French engineer Baron Loicq de Lobel in 1906. Czar Nicholas II of Russia issued an order authorising a Franco-American syndicate represented by de Lobel to begin work on the Trans-Siberian Alaska railroad project, but no physical work ever commenced.

Suggestions have been made to construct a Bering Strait bridge between Alaska and Siberia. Despite the unprecedented engineering, political, and financial challenges, Russia green-lit a US$65-billion TKM-World Link tunnel project in August 2011. If completed, the tunnel would be the world&#x27;s longest. China considered construction of a &quot;China-Russia-Canada-America&quot; railroad line that would include construction of a underwater tunnel that would cross the Bering Strait.

== Proposed dam ==
In 1956, the Soviet Union proposed to the US a joint bi-national project to warm the Arctic Ocean and melt some of the ice cap. As designed by Petr Borisov, the Soviet project called for a dam across the Bering Strait. It would block the cold Pacific current from entering the Arctic. By pumping low-salinity cold surface water across the dam to the Pacific, warmer and higher salinity sea water from the Atlantic Ocean would be introduced into the Arctic Ocean. However, citing national security concerns, the CIA and FBI experts opposed the Soviet plan by arguing that while the plan was feasible, it would compromise NORAD and thus the dam could be built at only an immense cost. Soviet scientist D. A. Drogaytsev also opposed the idea, stating that the sea north of the dam and north-flowing rivers in Siberia would become unnavigable year round, and the Gobi and other deserts would be extended to the northern Siberia coastline.

American Charles P. Steinmetz (1865–1923) earlier proposed to widen the Bering Strait by removing St. Lawrence Island and parts of Seward and Chukotski Peninsulas. A strait wide would let the Japan Current melt the Arctic Ocean.

In the 21st century, a dam has also been proposed. However, the aim of the proposal is to preserve the Arctic ice cap against global warming.

== &quot;Ice Curtain&quot; border ==
During the Cold War, the Bering Strait marked the border between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Diomede Islands—Big Diomede (Russia) and Little Diomede (US)—are only apart. Traditionally, the indigenous people in the area had frequently crossed the border back and forth for &quot;routine visits, seasonal festivals and subsistence trade&quot;, but were prevented from doing so during the Cold War. The border became known as the &quot;Ice Curtain&quot;. It was completely closed, and there was no regular passenger air or boat traffic.

Since 2012, the Russian coast of the Bering Strait has been a closed military zone. Through organized trips and the use of special permits, it is possible for foreigners to visit. All arrivals must be through an airport or a cruise port, near the Bering Strait only at Anadyr or Provideniya. Unauthorized travelers who arrive on shore after crossing the strait, even those with visas, may be arrested, imprisoned briefly, fined, deported and banned from future visas.

<text>Swabia (, Swabian: &quot;Schwaabe&quot;, ) is one of the seven administrative regions of Bavaria, Germany. It consists of ten districts and 340 municipalities (including four cities) with Augsburg being the administrative capital. 

==Governance==
The county of Swabia is located in southwest Bavaria. It was annexed by Bavaria in 1803, is part of the historic region of Swabia and was formerly ruled by dukes of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. During the Nazi period, the area was separated from the rest of Bavaria to become the Gau Swabia. It was re-incorporated into Bavaria after the war.

The Regierungsbezirk is subdivided into 3 regions (&quot;Planungsregionen&quot;): Allgäu, Augsburg, and Donau-Iller. Donau-Iller also includes two districts and one city of Baden-Württemberg.


==Districts and district-free towns before the regional reorganization in 1972==

==Population==
Historical population of Swabia:
*1939: 934,311
*1950: 1,293,734
*1961: 1,340,217
*1970: 1,467,454
*1987: 1,546,504

*2015: 1,846,020
*2019: 1,899,442

==Economy==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was € 74.8 billion in 2018, accounting for 2.2% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was € 36,500 or 121% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 101% of the EU average.

==History==

The Bavarian administrative region of Swabia is the eastern part of the Duchy of Swabia. After the execution of the Swabian duke Conradin in Naples in 1268, his uncle, the Bavarian duke Louis, inherited some of Conradin&#x27;s possessions in Swabia. In 1803, with the German Mediatisation, Bavaria acquired the further East Swabian territories, which were merged with Palatinate-Neuburg.

After the founding of the Kingdom of Bavaria, the state was totally reorganised and, in 1808, divided into 15 administrative districts (), in Bavaria called . They were created in the fashion of the French departements, quite even in size and population, and named after their main rivers. 

In the following years, due to territorial changes (e.g. the loss of Tyrol, the addition of the Palatinate), the number of districts was reduced to 8. The Swabian territories were merged with Palatinate-Neuburg and the new district was called (Upper Danube District). In 1837, king Ludwig I of Bavaria renamed all the districts after historical territorial names and tribes of the area. This also involved some border changes or territorial swaps. Thus the name changed to Swabia.

In 1945, the town of Lindau was detached from Bavaria by France, but it was reunited with the district of Swabia in 1955. In 1972, the former Swabian city Neuburg an der Donau was reunited with the district of Upper Bavaria.

==Main sites==

Major attractions include the capital Augsburg; several other old cities including Donauwörth, Nördlingen, Memmingen, Mindelheim, Kaufbeuren and Kempten; the Ottobeuren Abbey and the scenic attractions of the River Danube in the north; the Allgäu in the south; the Allgäu Alps and Oberstdorf; and the royal castles of Hohenschwangau, Neuschwanstein and Füssen. With the district of Lindau, Bavarian Swabia has access to Lake Constance.

==Food and drink==
Swabian cuisine is down-to-earth and rather simple. Noodle products are very important.
* Brenntar
* Spätzle
* Maultaschen
* Bergkäse
* Schupfnudel
* Alb-Leisa
==Notable people==
* Michael Bredl (1916–1999), a singer and collector of traditional Swabian Volksmusik
* Ludwig Aurbacher (1784–1847), famous for his stories about The Seven Swabians
* Ludwig Ganghofer (1855–1920), writer and inventor
* Sebastian Kneipp (1821–1897), inventor of Kneipp-Kur known as Water-Doctor of Hydrotherapy

<doc id="53214" wikidata="Q47967" url="?curid=53214" title="North West England">
<text>North West England is one of nine official regions of England and consists of the ceremonial counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. The North West had a population of 7,417,397 in 2021. It is the third-most-populated region in the United Kingdom, after the South East and Greater London. The largest settlements are Manchester and Liverpool. It is one of the three regions, alongside North East England and Yorkshire and the Humber, that make up Northern England.

==Subdivisions==
The official region consists of the following subdivisions:

After abolition of the Greater Manchester and Merseyside County Councils in 1986, power was transferred to the metropolitan boroughs, making them equivalent to unitary authorities. In April 2011, Greater Manchester gained a top-tier administrative body in the form of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which means the 10 Greater Manchester boroughs are once again second-tier authorities.

==Geography==
North West England is bounded to the east by the Pennines and to the west by the Irish Sea. The region extends from the Scottish Borders in the north to the West Midlands region in the south. To its southwest is North Wales. Amongst the better known of the North West&#x27;s physiographical features are the Lake District and the Cheshire Plain. The highest point in North West England (and the highest peak in England) is Scafell Pike, Cumbria, at a height of .

Windermere is the largest natural lake in England, while Broad Crag Tarn on Broad Crag is England&#x27;s highest lake. Wast Water is England&#x27;s deepest lake, being 74 metres deep.

A mix of rural and urban landscape, two large conurbations, centred on Liverpool and Manchester, occupy much of the south of the region. The north of the region, comprising Cumbria and northern Lancashire, is largely rural, as is the far south which encompasses parts of the Cheshire Plain and Peak District.

The region includes parts of three National parks (all of the Lake District, and small parts of the Peak District and the Yorkshire Dales) and three areas of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (all of Arnside and Silverdale and the Solway Coast, and almost all of the Forest of Bowland).

===Weather===
Weather in this part of England is typically classified as maritime, moist and temperate, with a moderate annual temperature range. Average annual precipitation in the UK typically ranges from approximately 800 mm to 1,400 mm. Temperatures are generally close to the national average. Cumbria usually experiences the most severe weather, with high precipitation in the mountainous regions of the Lake District and Pennines. In winter, the most severe weather occurs in the more exposed and elevated areas of the North West, once again mainly the Lake District and Pennine areas.

==Demographics==
===Population, density, and settlements===
&quot;Source: Office for National Statistics Mid Year Population Estimates in 2008&quot;
North West England&#x27;s population accounts for just over 13% of England&#x27;s overall population. 37.86% of the North West&#x27;s population resides in Greater Manchester, 21.39% in Lancashire, 20.30% in Merseyside, 14.76% in Cheshire and 7.41% live in the largest county by area, Cumbria.

===Ethnicity===
According to 2009 Office for National Statistics estimates, 91.6% (6,323,300) of people in the region describe themselves as &#x27;White&#x27;: 88.4% (6,101,100) White British, 1.0% (67,200) White Irish and 2.2% (155,000) White Other. During the Industrial Revolution hundreds of thousands of Welsh people migrated to the North West of England to work in the coal mines. Parts with notably high populations with Welsh ancestry as a result of this include Liverpool, Chester, Skelmersdale, Widnes, Halewood, Wallasey, Ashton-in-Makerfield and Birkenhead.

The Mixed Race population makes up 1.3% (93,800) of the region&#x27;s population. There are 323,800 South Asians, making up 4.7% of the population, and 1.1% Black (80,600). 0.6% of the population (39,900) are Chinese and 0.5% (36,500) of people belong to another ethnic group.

North West England is a very diverse region, with Manchester and Liverpool amongst the most diverse cities in Europe. 19.4% of Blackburn with Darwen&#x27;s population are Muslim, the third-highest among all local authorities in the United Kingdom and the highest outside London. Areas such as Moss Side in Greater Manchester are home to a 30%+ Black British population. In contrast, the town of St. Helens in Merseyside, unusually for a city area, has a very low percentage of ethnic minorities with 98% identifying as White British. The City of Liverpool, over 800 years old, is one of the few places in Britain where ethnic minority populations can be traced back over dozens of generations: being the closest major city in England to Ireland, it is home to a significant ethnic Irish population, with the city being home to one of the first ever Afro-Caribbean communities in the UK, as well as the oldest Chinatown in Europe.
===Place of birth===

The table below is not how many people belong to each ethnic group (e.g. a BBC News article in 2008 claimed there are over 25,000 ethnic Italians in Manchester alone whilst only 6,000 Italian-born people live in the North West). The proportion of people residing in North West England born outside the UK was 11.7% in 2021, compared with 8.2% in 2011 and 5.1% in 2001. Below are the fifteen largest overseas-born groups in the region according to the 2021 census, alongside the two previous censuses:


===Religion===
One in five of the population in the North West is Catholic, a result of large-scale Irish emigration in the nineteenth century as well as the high number of English recusants in Lancashire.

===Social deprivation===
Of the nine regions of England, the North West has the fourth-highest GVA per capita—the highest outside southern England. Despite this the region has above average multiple deprivation with wealth heavily concentrated on very affluent areas like rural Cheshire, rural Lancashire, and south Cumbria. As measured by the Indices of deprivation 2007, the region has many more Lower Layer Super Output Areas in the 20% most deprived districts than the 20% least deprived council districts. Only North East England shows more indicators of deprivation than the North West, but the number of affluent areas in the North West is very similar to Yorkshire and the Humber.

The most deprived local authority areas in the region (based on specific wards within those borough areas) are, in descending order—Liverpool, Manchester, Knowsley, Blackpool, Salford, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Rochdale, Barrow-in-Furness, Halton, Hyndburn, Oldham, Pendle, St Helens, Preston, Bolton, Tameside, Wirral, Wigan, Copeland, Sefton, and Rossendale.

In 2007 when Cheshire still had district councils, the least deprived council districts in the region by council district, in descending order, were—Congleton, Ribble Valley, Macclesfield, and South Lakeland. These areas have Conservative MPs, except South Lakeland has a Lib Dem and Labour MPs. At county level, before it was split into two, Cheshire was the least deprived, followed by Trafford, and by Warrington and Stockport.

In March 2011, the overall unemployment claimant count was 4.2% for the region. Inside the region the highest was Liverpool with 6.8%, followed by Knowsley on 6.3%, Halton with 5.5% and Rochdale with 5.1%. The lowest claimant count is in Eden (Cumbria) and Ribble Valley (Lancashire) each with 1.3%, followed by South Lakeland with 1.4%.

===Elections===
In the 2019 general election, the Conservatives gained ten seats, from the Labour Party, with no other seats changing hands. Labour held 42 of their 52 seats, albeit many with slimmed down majorities. They remain the dominant party in the region by seat count, with the Conservatives total now standing at 27. The Conservatives made two gains in Cheshire, three gains in Lancashire, five gains in Greater Manchester, notably including Andy Burnham&#x27;s former seat of Leigh.

In the 2017 general election, the area was dominated by the Labour Party. Fifty-five per cent of the region&#x27;s electorate voted Labour, 36.3% Conservative, 5.4% Liberal Democrat, 1.9% UKIP and 1.1% Greens; however, by number of parliamentary seats, Labour have 54, the Conservatives have 20, and the Liberal Democrats have 1. The Lib Dems&#x27; North West seat is in south Cumbria; Labour dominates Greater Manchester, and the Conservatives&#x27; vote is concentrated in affluent suburban areas such as Cheadle, Hazel Grove and Altrincham and Sale West. Labour seats also predominate in Merseyside. In Cheshire the 2015 result was reversed, with Labour winning seven seats and the Conservatives four, whilst Lancashire is competitive between Labour and Conservative (8 seats each); the Labour seats in Lancashire are concentrated in the south of the county along the M65. For the region, the Labour gained 3 seats; there was a 5.2% swing from Conservative to Labour.

In the 2015 general election, Liverpool Walton was the safest seat in the UK, with a 72% majority, and in 2017 this was repeated with a 77% majority for Dan Carden (Labour), when an astonishing 85.7% of the electorate voted for him (the Conservatives came second with 8.6%). In the by-election of 2012, Manchester Central has the record for the lowest turnout in the UK—18%. Gwyneth Dunwoody, for Crewe and Nantwich, was the longest serving female MP until her death in 2008.

In the final European Elections in the UK in 2019, 31.23% voted for the Brexit Party, with Labour polling 21.91%, the Liberal Democrats 17.15% and the Green Party 12.48%. The Conservatives came fifth in the region with 7.55% of votes cast.

===Language and dialect===
The earliest known language spoken in the North West was a dialect of the Brythonic language spoken across much of Britain from at least the Iron Age up to the arrival of English in the first millennium AD. Fragments of this early language are seen in the inscriptions and place names of the Roman era. In some parts of the region, the Brythonic dialect developed into the medieval language known today as Cumbric, which continued to be spoken perhaps as late as the 12th century in the north of Cumbria. This early Celtic heritage remains today in place names such as Carlisle, Penrith and Eccles, and many river names such as Cocker, Kent and Eden.

English may have been spoken in the North West from around the 7th century AD, when the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria first appears to have made inroads west of the Pennines. The language at this time would have been the Northumbrian dialect of Old English. The high percentage of English place names in the region as a whole suggests English became almost ubiquitous over the coming centuries, particularly in the area south of the Lake District. Manchester, Liverpool, Lancaster, Blackburn and Preston are among the region&#x27;s many English place names. In the 9th to the 11th centuries, Danes from the east and Norsemen from Ireland and Scotland began settling in the area. The North West is really the only area of England where Norse settlement was significant and their influence remains in the place names and dialect of the region. Elements like &quot;fell&quot;, &quot;thwaite&quot; and &quot;tarn&quot;, which are particularly common in Cumbria, are all Norse. The numerous Kirkbys and place names with &quot;holm&quot; and &quot;dale&quot; show the Scandinavian influence throughout the North West.

Through the Middle Ages the dialects of the North West would have been considerably different from those spoken in the Midlands and south. It was only with the spread of literacy (particularly with the publication of the King James Bible) that Standard English spread to the region. Even so, local dialects continued to be used and were relatively widespread until the 19th and 20th centuries.

In modern times, English is the most spoken language in the North West, with a large percentage of the population fluent in it, and close to 100% conversational in it. To the north-east of the region, within the historic boundaries of Cumberland, the Cumbrian dialect is dominant. The historical county of Lancashire covered a vast amount of land, and the Lancashire dialect and accent is still predominant throughout the county, and stretches as far north as Furness in South Cumbria to parts of north Greater Manchester and Merseyside in the south of the region. The region boasts some of the most distinctive accents in the form of the Scouse accent, which originates from Liverpool and its surrounding areas, and the Manc accent, deriving from the central Manchester district. Both of these descend from the Lancashire dialect but have some distinctions from it, especially Scouse. The region&#x27;s accents are among those referred to as &#x27;Northern English&#x27;.

Large immigrant populations in the North West result in the presence of significant immigrant languages. South Asian languages such as Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi are widespread, with the largest number of speakers residing in Preston, Blackburn and Manchester. The Chinese once made up the largest minority in the region (as Liverpool has one of the oldest Chinese settlements in Europe), and still do to the far north where Chinese is spoken by small but significant communities. Since the enlargement of the EU, over one million Poles have immigrated to the UK, a large number of them settling in the North West. Places such as Crewe as well as larger cities make Polish written information available for the public, to much controversy. Other immigrant languages with a presence in the North West are Spanish, mainly amongst the Latin American communities in Liverpool and Manchester, as well as various other Eastern European and Asian languages.

The most taught languages in schools across the North West are English, French and Spanish. German and Italian are available at more senior levels and, in cities such as Manchester and Liverpool, even Urdu and Mandarin are being taught to help maintain links between the local minority populations.

===Eurostat NUTS===
In the Eurostat Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), North West is a level-1 NUTS region, coded &quot;UKD&quot;, which (since 2015) is subdivided as follows:
==Cities and towns==

Population &gt; 400,000
Population &gt; 100,000
Population &gt; 70,000
Population &gt; 50,000

Population &gt; 30,000
Population &gt; 20,000

Population &gt; 10,000

Population &gt; 5,000
===Metropolitan areas===

The five largest metropolitan areas in the North West are as follows:
*Greater Manchester metropolitan area – 2,556,000
*Liverpool/Birkenhead metropolitan area – 2,241,000
*Blackburn/Burnley – 391,000
*Preston – 354,000
*Blackpool −304,000

Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered parts of a single large polynuclear metropolitan area, or megalopolis but are usually treated as separate metropolitan areas. In some studies, part of Wigan in Greater Manchester is considered part of the Liverpool metropolitan area.

==Politics==
The North West of England has historically been held by the Labour Party.

===National politics===
In the 2019 United Kingdom general election, the Labour Party won a plurality of seats in the North West.
===Elected regional assembly===
It is one of the two regions (along with Yorkshire and the Humber) that were expected to hold a referendum on the establishment of an elected regional assembly. However, when the North East region of England rejected having an elected regional assembly in a referendum, further referendums were cancelled and the proposals for elected regional assemblies in England put on hold. The regional leaders&#x27; forum, 4NW is based on Waterside Drive in Wigan.

===European Parliament===
The former North West England European Parliament constituency had the same boundaries as the Region.

==History==
Ten English regions were established by the government in 1994. At that time, Merseyside, which already had its own Government Office, formerly the Merseyside Task Force, was regarded as a separate region. In 1998, Merseyside was merged into the North West region. This action was controversial in some quarters. Regional Government Offices were abolished in April 2011 by the Coalition Government.

===Scientific heritage===

Sir Ernest Marsden (of Blackburn) and Hans Geiger conducted the Geiger–Marsden experiment at the University of Manchester in 1909, where the Geiger counter was invented, which demonstrated the existence of the atomic nucleus. Sir J. J. Thomson of Cheetham Hill discovered the electron (given its name in 1891 by George Johnstone Stoney) in April 1897 and received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1906; his son George Paget Thomson would win the Nobel Prize for Physics 1937 for discovering electron diffraction (at the University of Aberdeen). John Dalton, from Cumbria and moved to Manchester, developed atomic theory. William Sturgeon of Lancashire invented the electromagnet in 1825.

Sydney Chapman, a mathematician from Eccles, in 1930 explained the ozone–oxygen cycle in the stratosphere, being the first to propose that atmospheric oxygen or ozone molecules absorb (harmful UVB and UVC) ultraviolet wavelengths of light in photolysis, to produce reactive single atoms which accumulate to form the ozone layer.

Graphene was discovered at the University of Manchester in 2004 under Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov.
At the Calico Printers&#x27; Association in Manchester in 1941, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson discovered polyethylene terephthalate, known as PET, a common polyester compound found in plastic bottles and food, and also known as Terylene or Dacron. Cheslene and Crepes of Macclesfield discovered crimplene, the fabric that is now referred to as polyester. ICI Dyestuffs at Hexagon House, in Blackley in north Manchester, discovered Procion dyes. At the Winnington Laboratory on 27 March 1933, Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson discovered polythene in an ICI laboratory in Northwich, when reacting benzaldehyde with ethene at a pressure of 2,000 atmospheres; the process was improved in 1935 by Michael Perrin.

Halothane, the world&#x27;s first synthetic inhalation general anaesthetic gas, was discovered in 1951 at ICI&#x27;s Widnes Laboratory by Wallasey&#x27;s Charles Suckling, and first tested on a patient in Manchester in 1956; it works by binding to the GABA receptor. John Charnley of Bury invented the hip replacement in 1962 at Wrightington Hospital, Lancashire, north-west of Wigan. Clatterbridge Hospital in Bebington has a cyclotron (linear accelerator), and is the only hospital in the UK to offer proton therapy.

Alderley Park opened in October 1957, and ICI Pharmaceuticals was formed in the same year. In 1962 Dora Richardson of ICI discovered tamoxifen. ICI Alderley Park later discovered Anastrozole, Fulvestrant, Goserelin and Bicalutamide, later made by Zeneca. James Black discovered beta blockers—propranolol (Inderal) at Alderley Park in 1962. The Wellcome Foundation, a provider of much of Britain&#x27;s medical research, was based from 1966 to 1997 at Crewe Hall in Crewe Green.

Clifford Cocks and James H. Ellis from Cheshire, with Malcolm J. Williamson, invented the RSA (algorithm) in 1973 at GCHQ, used for public-key cryptography. Richard Owen from Lancaster coined the word &quot;dinosaur&quot; in 1842, and he founded the Natural History Museum, London, opening in 1881.

===Industrial heritage===
The Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway was the world&#x27;s first passenger inter-city railway in 1830. Manchester Liverpool Road railway station is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving railway station, having opened on 15 September 1830; the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway had opened in 1825. Chat Moss was a problem to constructing the railway, with Edge Hill Tunnel and Sankey Viaduct; the line was bitterly opposed by William Molyneux, 2nd Earl of Sefton. The Bridgewater Canal was the first recognised canal of the modern era. Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater had visited France and noted their canals. John Gilbert had the innovative idea to use water pumped out of his coal mines to fill a canal from the Duke&#x27;s Worsley mines to Manchester. It was designed by James Brindley and built in 1761.

The Bridgewater Foundry in Patricroft (Salford), can claim to be the world&#x27;s first factory
with an assembly line type arrangement in 1836. Joseph Huddart of Cumbria was the first to mechanise the production of rope in 1793. The spinning jenny was invented in 1764 in Lancashire by James Hargreaves, a mechanical advance on the spinning wheel.

The University of Manchester built the world&#x27;s first programmable computer, the Manchester Baby, on 21 June 1948; the Williams–Kilburn tube on the machine was the world&#x27;s first computer memory, and the beginning of random-access memory (RAM); the baby computer was made from 550 Mullard valves. The first commercially available computer, the Ferranti Mark 1, was made in Manchester and sold in February 1951 to the University of Manchester. The world&#x27;s first transistor computer was the Manchester Transistor Computer in November 1953. Atlas was another important computer developed at the University of Manchester, largely developed by Tom Kilburn; at the time in 1962 it was most powerful computer in the world. The government had dropped its financial support of this computer, and was only funded by Ferranti—the total development cost was around £1m. Britain was leading the world at this time in computing, with the only main competitor being IBM; after the mid-1950s America took over the industry. The spreadsheet was invented in 1974, known as the Works Record System, and used an Adabas database on an IBM 3270 at ICI in Northwich; it was developed by Robert Mais and it was around four years before (the more well-known) VisiCalc in 1978. The University of Manchester has collected 25 Nobel prizes, though recent years have been less notable.

Parsonage Colliery at Leigh had the UK&#x27;s deepest mine—1,260 metres in 1949. Macclesfield was the base of UK&#x27;s silk weaving industry. John Benjamin Dancer of Manchester invented microphotography in 1839, which would lead to microform in the 1920s. Frank Hornby from Liverpool invented Meccano in 1901, where Meccano Ltd would be based for over 60 years. Bryant &amp; May&#x27;s site in Garston was the last wooden match factory in the UK, closing in 1994 to become The Matchworks business centre off the A561 west of the former Speke airport. Cottonopolis was the industrial name for Manchester and the local area. Manchester at one time was the world&#x27;s richest city. The CIS Tower, built by John Laing in 1962, was Europe&#x27;s tallest building, and Britain&#x27;s tallest building until 1963, and Manchester&#x27;s tallest building until 2006.

Kirkby was planned in the 1950s as the largest trading estate in Britain—1,800 acres. Trafford Park is the world&#x27;s first planned industrial estate. Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers opened their first co-operative outlet on 21 December 1844.
Alastair Pilkington invented the float glass method of manufacture in 1957 at St Helens, announcing it in January 1959. It was manufactured from 1961, and 80% of the world&#x27;s glass is made with the process; the former site closed in 2014 and it is made now at the Green Gate site. Pears soap, made at Port Sunlight, is the world&#x27;s first registered brand, and world&#x27;s oldest brand in existence. Elihu Thomson, born in Manchester who subsequently moved to America, formed Thomson-CSF which became Thales Group in 2000. The British part (British Thomson-Houston) would later become part of GEC; he invented the arc lamp. Henry Brunner from Liverpool would join with Ludwig Mond in the 1860s to form a chemical company which became ICI in 1926. Mossbay Steelworks in Workington, when opened in 1877, were the world&#x27;s first large-scale steelworks; its austenitic manganese steel (mangalloy) was produced from 1877 until 1974, with Britain&#x27;s railways converting from iron to steel by the 1880s. Track was made there for the UK&#x27;s railways (exclusively from the 1970s onwards, with the steel made in Teesside) until August 2006; much of the rails made were exported (from 1882), with its main competitor being Voestalpine of Austria, and a plant (bought by British Steel in 1999) in Hayange, France, who make all of SNCF&#x27;s railway tracks, and the Katowice Steelworks in Poland. Workington was thought to make the best quality rail track in the world.

Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, born in Liverpool in 1864, was an electrical engineer who designed the layout for Deptford Power Station, the first alternating current power station in the world in 1887, and whose design all others would follow; his later company Ferranti, of Oldham, would later be an industry leader in Britain&#x27;s defence electronics, on the FTSE 100 Index. Ferranti&#x27;s design of increasing AC voltage to high tension at the power station, to be stepped-down at a transformer at substations before entering properties, is the system all electricity networks take today; the system reduces wasteful heating of electricity transmission cables.
The Chain Home radar transmitters were built by Metrovick at its Trafford Park Works, which became part of AEI in 1929, GEC in 1968, and as Alstom it was closed in June 2000. 2ZY, the first broadcasts in the north of England, were made from the Metrovick factory in November 1922, which became part of the BBC National Programme in 1927. GEC opened its first factory in Manchester in 1888, moving to Salford in 1895 at the Peel Works, and had built the Osram electric light company in 1893. The Metropolitan-Vickers F.2 of Trafford Park Works, Manchester was the first axial-flow jet engine, with a nine-stage compressor, first running in 1941. It would end up as the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire and the American-built Wright J65. The F.2 gas turbine would power MGB.2009 the first gas-turbine-powered vessel in 1947. No. 1 Parachute Training School RAF—the main parachute training site for the war—was at RAF Ringway (the Central Landing Establishment and Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment) now Manchester Airport; many aircraft were built there too, and the Ford Trafford Park Factory built 34,000 aircraft engines—mostly Merlin engines; the nearby Metropolitan-Vickers factory built many Lancasters.
Calder Hall was the world&#x27;s first nuclear power station in 1956. There are approximately 430 nuclear power stations around the world, and the UK is the third most experienced operator of nuclear reactors after the US and France, and is the world&#x27;s ninth largest producer of nuclear-generated electricity, with nine stations operating in the UK producing around 10GW. New-build nuclear power stations will either be the AP1000 (Toshiba Westinghouse NuGeneration) or EPR design (developed by Areva). BNFL bought Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric Company in 1999; it was sold in October 2006 for £5.4 billion to Toshiba. British Energy was sold in 2009 for £12.5 billion to EDF; Centrica (British Gas) had also wanted to buy it; 26 Magnox reactors were built in the UK, followed by 14 AGR reactors.

Operation Hurricane on 3 October 1952, Britain&#x27;s first nuclear bomb, detonated on HMS &quot;Plym&quot; on the Montebello Islands in the state of Western Australia, was made of plutonium-239 mostly made at Windscale (which began production in 1950), with some possibly from Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, Canada (where the Tube Alloys project was later moved).

W. T. Glover &amp; Co. of Salford were important electricity cable manufacturers throughout the early 20th century. BAE Systems Wind Tunnel Department at Warton—one of its four wind tunnels—the High Speed Wind Tunnel—can test speeds intermittently up to Mach 3.8 (trisonic)—the second fastest in the UK, to the University of Manchester&#x27;s Aero-Physics Laboratory which has a hypersonic wind tunnel up to Mach 6. Osborne Reynolds of Owens College (which became the Victoria University of Manchester in 1904), known worldwide for his Reynolds number (introduced elsewhere by the mathematician George Gabriel Stokes), showed in the early 1880s that wind tunnels (invented by Francis Herbert Wenham in 1871) could model large-scale objects accurately. BAE Systems Regional Aircraft assembled Britain&#x27;s last airliner, the British Aerospace 146 (Avro RJX), at Woodford in November 2001. The Merlin-powered Avro Tudor G-AGPF, which took off from what is now Manchester Airport on 14 June 1945, was Britain&#x27;s first pressurised civilian aircraft; only 38 were built and it was designed for the North Atlantic route. On 13 May 1949, &quot;VN799&quot; the English Electric Canberra first flew from Warton: Warton at the time was a former USAAF wartime maintenance base; the German Arado Ar 234 was technically the world&#x27;s first jet bomber; the Canberra would be the first jet aircraft to make a non-stop crossing of the Atlantic on 21 February 1951.

Robert Whitehead of Bolton invented the modern-day torpedo in 1866. Sir William Pickles Hartley of Lancashire founded Hartley&#x27;s Jam in 1871, building a purpose-built village at Aintree. Sir Henry Tate also came from Lancashire, joining Abram Lyle in 1921, of whose Golden syrup tins are claimed to be Britain&#x27;s oldest brand; he established the Tate Gallery in 1897. Robert Hope-Jones of the Wirral invented the Wurlitzer organ. The Christys&#x27; &amp; Co factory in Stockport was the largest hat-making factory in the world in the nineteenth century; it became part of Associated British Hat Manufacturers and is now in Oxfordshire. The company owner&#x27;s son founded Christy in 1850 in Droylsden (now in Tameside), which invented the industrially produced towel.
Britain&#x27;s most popular car, the Ford Escort, was made throughout its life (until 21 July 2000) at Halewood by Ford; 5 million were made there from 1967. In 1998, production of its replacement the Focus was transferred to Saarlouis and Valencia, which signalled the end of the site&#x27;s ownership by Ford. The Jaguar X-Type was first made there in May 2001, until late 2009. In the UK, the Mondeo has sold 1.4m since 1993, and is made in Valencia in Spain.

Starchaser Industries of Hyde is hoping to send a British citizen into space, on a British rocket; BAC at Preston had proposed its MUSTARD re-usable spacecraft in 1964, which although not built had given NASA a concept.

===Culture===

The Suffragette movement came from Manchester—the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union. Arthur Wynne, born in Liverpool, invented the crossword in December 1913. On 13 August 1964, Britain carried out its last two executions at Strangeways and Walton Prison. Under the Museums Act 1845, the UK&#x27;s second and third public municipal libraries were at Warrington in 1848 and at Salford Museum and Art Gallery in 1850; Canterbury had been first in 1847. The first Trades Union Congress was held in 1868 at the Mechanics&#x27; Institute, Manchester. The World Pie Eating Championship is held in Wigan each year.

Ann Lee from Manchester started the USA Shakers movement, founded out of the Quakers, which itself has strong links to Pendle Hill in Lancashire. Joseph Livesey of Preston was the founder of Britain&#x27;s temperance movement, and the word &quot;teetotal&quot; was first coined in Preston in 1833. The crumbly Cheshire cheese is thought to be the oldest in Britain. Heaton Park in north Manchester is the largest municipal park in Europe. Jelly Babies were invented in Lancaster in 1864, at Fryers of Lancashire. The first KFC outlet in the UK was on Fishergate in Preston in May 1965, opened by the entrepreneur Ray Allen. Oldham claims to be the site of the first fried potatoes in the UK in 1860. The UK&#x27;s biggest dance music festival takes place on the August Bank Holiday at Creamfields on Daresbury Estate. Ingvar Kamprad&#x27;s IKEA opened its first UK store in Warrington on 1 October 1987; the UK was the 20th country at the time that IKEA had been established. The International Cheese Awards are held at the end of July in Nantwich.

Liverpool and Manchester, the two largest cities in the North West by population, are known for being the birthplace of beat music (also called &quot;Merseybeat&quot;) during the 1960s to 1970s, and the development of the Madchester music scene from the 1980s, and 1990s respectively.

&quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; was an influential 1960s film set in Salford, depicting working class poverty in ways not previously seen at the cinema, known as kitchen sink realism; Walter Greenwood&#x27;s &quot;Love on the Dole&quot;, a 1930s book also set in Salford, was thought by the BBFC to be too sordid a depiction of poverty to be made into a film; Mike Leigh, from Salford, has produced films on a similar subject.

==Transport==
===Transport policy===
As part of the national transport planning system,
the North West Regional Assembly was, before its abolition in 2008, required to produce a Regional Transport Strategy (RTS) to provide long term planning for transport in the region. This involved region wide transport schemes, such as those carried out by the Highways Agency and Network Rail. Within the region, the local transport authorities plan for the future by producing Local Transport Plans (LTPs) which outline their strategies, policies and implementation programmes. The most recent LTP is that for the period 2006–11. In the North West region, the following transport authorities have published their LTP online: Blackburn with Darwen U.A, Blackpool U.A., Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Halton U.A., Lancashire, Merseyside and Warrington U.A. Since 1 April 2009, when the county of Cheshire was split into two unitary councils the Cheshire transport authority ceased to exist, however it is the most recent LTP for the area.

===Road===
====Regionwide====
Regionwide, the principal road link is the M6, which enters the region, from Scotland, near Carlisle in the north and leaves it, for the English Midlands, near Crewe in the south. It connects such towns and cities as Penrith, Kendal, Lancaster, Preston, Warrington, Liverpool and Manchester. The M6 intersects many of the North West&#x27;s motorways and A-roads, carrying almost 120,000 vehicles per day (41,975,000 per year).

Britain&#x27;s most severe steep road is Hardknott Pass in Cumbria and the highest road in the UK is the former A6293 at 2,780 ft at Milburn, Cumbria; the highest classified road in England was the A689 east of Nenthead in Cumbria on the Durham boundary.
====Greater Manchester and Merseyside====

The Greater Manchester and Merseyside areas are home to almost 4 million people; over half of the region&#x27;s population. The road networks intertwining these metropolitan areas are extremely important to the economy and are largely motorway, including the M62 which crosses the entire country (east to west, Hull to Liverpool); this motorway directly connects the cities of Manchester and Liverpool, carrying 78,000 vehicles in the North West per day.

The Merseyside-Manchester region has many other motorways that serve many millions on a daily basis: the M61 connects Manchester to Preston; the M56 runs south of Manchester to Cheshire and Wales; the M57 and M58 motorways run north of Liverpool and connect towns such as St. Helens and Wigan; the M60 is Manchester&#x27;s ring road; and the M67 and M66 motorways run east and north respectively, both of these roads are under and link Manchester to smaller outlying settlements. On top of this there are countless numbers of A-roads, B-roads and minor roads which circle, entwine and serve these two major metropolises.

====Cumbria====
In Cumbria the M6 runs all the way down the east of the county connecting the very north of England to the Lancashire border. The A590 links Barrow-in-Furness to Kendal with around 14,000 vehicles per day. The A595 runs all the way along the West Cumbrian coast beginning near Barrow and ending in Carlisle, linking towns such as Whitehaven and Workington. The A591 road runs from Kendal to the centre of the county connecting Lake District settlements like Windermere, Ambleside and Keswick. Other important A-roads include the A5092, A66, A596 and formerly the A74, until this was upgraded to motorway standard as an extension of the M6 between 2006 and 2008 to meet the A74(M) at the Scottish border.

====Lancashire====
The Lancashire economy relies strongly on the M6, which also runs from north to south (Lancaster to Chorley). Other motorways in the region include the M55, which connects the city of Preston and the town of Blackpool at in length. The M65 motorway runs from east to west, starting in the town of Colne, running past Burnley, Accrington, Blackburn and terminating in Preston. The Lancaster-Morecambe area is served by the A683, A6, A588 and A589 roads. The Blackpool-Fylde-Fleetwood area is home to the A583, A584, A585, A586, A587 and A588 roads. The city of Preston and its surroundings are served by the A6, A59, A582, A583, A584 and, to the very south-east, the M61 motorway. To the east of the county are the A59, A6119, A677, A679, A666, A680, A56, A646 and A682. The M66 begins inside the county border near Edenfield, providing an important link between east Lancashire and Manchester.

====Cheshire====
In Cheshire, there are four motorways: the M6, the M56 (linking Chester to the east), the M53 (linking Chester to Birkenhead) and the M62, which runs just along the county&#x27;s northern border with Merseyside and Greater Manchester. The Cheshire road system is made up of of highway and the principal road (M6) carries 140,000 vehicles in the county daily, linking the North West to the West Midlands.

The county town of Chester is served by the A55, A483 and A494 roads, amongst others. To the west of the M6, Crewe, Northwich and Sandbach are served by the A54, A51, A49, A533, A556 and A530 roads; these all eventually link up connecting the towns to the larger cities, including Stoke-on-Trent to the south. To the east of the M6 in Cheshire lies the Peak District and towns such as Macclesfield and Congleton, which are served by the A6, A537, A536, A34, A523 and A566 roads.

===Air===


The biggest international airport in the region is Manchester Airport, which serves 28.2 million passengers annually; more than some of the world&#x27;s major aviation hubs. The airport is home to three terminals, plus the World Freight Terminal, which serve destinations worldwide. The largest airlines at the airport (in terms of numbers of flights in 2007) were Flybe, BMI, British Airways, Jet2.com and Lufthansa; several long-haul carriers such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Virgin Atlantic, Singapore Airlines and Emirates also operate from the airport. Manchester Airports Group is owned approximately one-third by Manchester Council and one-third by the other nine Greater Manchester councils. In 2007, Manchester had a recorded 222,703 aircraft movements. The airport is also a hub for major holiday airlines such as First Choice Airways and Thomson Airways; it was previously served by Thomas Cook Airlines and Monarch Airlines.

The region&#x27;s second largest airport, but is the oldest and fastest growing, is Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which serves over 5 million passengers annually. The airport serves destinations primarily in the UK and Europe and is a major hub for EasyJet and Ryanair.

The only other significant passenger airport in the region was Blackpool Airport, which was refurbished in 2006 and handled around half a million passengers annually. Destinations ranged from the Canary Islands in Spain to the Republic of Ireland. Commercial flights ended there in March 2017.

===Rail===


The main connection by train is the West Coast Main Line, connecting most of the North West. Other important lines are the Liverpool to Manchester Lines and the North TransPennine, which connects Liverpool to Manchester through Warrington. East-west connections in Lancashire are carried via the Caldervale Line to Blackpool. Liverpool and Manchester both have extensive local passenger rail networks operating high-frequency commuter trains. The quietest railway station in the region, by usage, is Reddish South, the 4th quietest in Britain.

The InterCity branded service in the UK began between London and Manchester in the mid-1960s; the new Euston station opened in 1968. With the new electrification of the line in the late 1960s, passenger numbers doubled.

The region saw the last steam-train service on the UK network – the Fifteen Guinea Special on 11 August 1968, with

==Education==
===Secondary education===
Secondary schools are mostly comprehensive, but Trafford retains a wholly selective school system, and there are some other grammar schools in Lancashire, Wirral, Liverpool and Cumbria.

There are around 345,000 at secondary school in the region, the third highest in England, after South East England and Greater London. This is around three times as much as there are in North East England. For school truancy the most persistent truants are in Manchester with a rate of 7.3%, followed by Knowsley with 6.9%, and Blackpool with 6.6%. The lowest truancy rate is in South Ribble with 2.4% followed by Ribble Valley with 2.9% (both in Lancashire).

At A level in 2010, Trafford performed the best and, again like its results at GCSE, is one of the best areas in England. The lowest performing area is, again, Knowsley but followed by Rochdale. Knowsley has had some dreadful results at A-level; Halewood Academy, its last school sixth-form, closed in 2016; there is now no school-based A-level provision in Knowsley, it is provided by the Knowsley Community College. For traditional counties, Lancashire gets excellent results at A-level, being one of the best in England. Areas also performing above the England average, in order of results, are Blackpool, Warrington, Wigan, Cheshire West and Chester, Bury, Cumbria, Wirral, and Stockport. Blackpool performs not particularly well at GCSE, yet produces much better results at A level—even better than Cheshire West and Chester, and the third-best in the region.

<text>South Africa is divided into nine provinces. On the eve of the 1994 general election, South Africa&#x27;s former homelands, known as Bantustans, were reintegrated into the country, and the four provinces were increased to nine. The borders of Natal and the Orange Free State were retained, while the Cape Province and Transvaal were divided into three provinces each, plus North West Province which straddles the border of and contains territory from both these two former provinces. The twelfth, thirteenth and sixteenth amendments to the Constitution of South Africa changed the borders of seven of the provinces.

==History==
The Union of South Africa was established in 1910 by combining four British colonies: Cape Colony; Natal Colony; Transvaal Colony; Orange River Colony. The last two were, before the Second Boer War, independent republics known as the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. These colonies became the four original provinces of the Union: Cape Province; Transvaal Province; Natal Province; Orange Free State Province.
Segregation of the black population started as early as 1913, with ownership of land by the black majority being restricted to certain areas totalling about 13% of the country. From the late 1950s, these areas were gradually consolidated into &quot;homelands&quot;, also called &quot;bantustans&quot;. Four of these homelands were established as quasi-independent nation states of the black population during the apartheid era. In 1976, the homeland of Transkei was the first to accept independence from South Africa, and although this independence was never acknowledged by any other country, three other homelands Bophuthatswana (1977), Venda (1979) and Ciskei (1981) followed suit.

On 27 April 1994, the date of the first non-racial elections and of the adoption of the Interim Constitution, all of these provinces and homelands were dissolved, and nine new provinces were established. The boundaries of these provinces were established in 1993 by a &quot;Commission on the Demarcation/Delimitation of Regions&quot; created by CODESA, and were broadly based on &quot;planning regions&quot; demarcated by the Development Bank of Southern Africa in the 1980s, and amalgamated from existing magisterial districts, with some concessions to political parties that wished to consolidate their power bases, by transferring districts between the proposed provinces. The definitions of the new provinces in terms of magisterial districts were found in Schedule 1 of the Interim Constitution.

On 11 July 2003, the 11th amendment to the fifth constitution renamed the Northern Province to Limpopo. On 1 March 2006, the 12th and 13th amendments altered the boundaries of 7 provinces. On 3 April 2009 the 16th amendment altered the boundaries of the North West and Gauteng provinces.

== Government ==
South Africa&#x27;s provinces are governed, in different ways, on a national, provincial and local level.

Nationally, there is the National Council of Provinces, one of the houses of Parliament. Then there is the provincial government and, below that, the administration of district and metropolitan municipalities.

=== National Council of Provinces ===

South Africa has two houses of parliament: the National Assembly, and the National Council of Provinces. The second exists to ensure that the interests of each province are protected in the laws passed by the National Assembly.

Each one of South Africa&#x27;s nine provinces sends 10 representatives to the National Council of Provinces. Six of these are permanent members of the council, and four are special delegates.

=== Provincial government ===
Each province is governed by a unicameral legislature. The size of the legislature is proportional to population, ranging from 30 members in the Northern Cape to 80 in KwaZulu-Natal. The legislatures are elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation; by convention, they are all elected on the same day, at the same time as the National Assembly election.

The provincial legislature elects, from amongst its members, a Premier, who is the head of the executive. The Premier chooses an Executive Council consisting of between five and ten members of the legislature, which is the cabinet of the provincial government. The Members of the Executive Council (MECs) are the provincial equivalent of ministers.

The powers of the provincial government are limited to specific topics listed in the national constitution. On some of these topicsfor example, agriculture, education, health and public housingthe province&#x27;s powers are shared with the national government, which can establish uniform standards and frameworks for the provincial governments to follow; on other topics the provincial government has exclusive power.

The provinces do not have their own court systems, as the administration of justice is the responsibility of the national government.

<doc id="53217" wikidata="Q1068126" url="?curid=53217" title="Exotic atom">
<text>An exotic atom is an otherwise normal atom in which one or more sub-atomic particles have been replaced by other particles. For example, electrons may be replaced by other negatively charged particles such as muons (muonic atoms) or pions (pionic atoms). Because these substitute particles are usually unstable, exotic atoms typically have very short lifetimes and no exotic atom observed so far can persist under normal conditions.

== Muonic atoms ==

In a &quot;muonic atom&quot; (previously called a &quot;mu-mesic&quot; atom, now known to be a misnomer as muons are not mesons), an electron is replaced by a muon, which, like the electron, is a lepton. Since leptons are only sensitive to weak, electromagnetic and gravitational forces, muonic atoms are governed to very high precision by the electromagnetic interaction.

Since a muon is more massive than an electron, the Bohr orbits are closer to the nucleus in a muonic atom than in an ordinary atom, and corrections due to quantum electrodynamics are more important. Study of muonic atoms&#x27; energy levels as well as transition rates from excited states to the ground state therefore provide experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics.

Muon-catalyzed fusion is a technical application of muonic atoms.

Other muonic atoms can be formed when negative muons interact with ordinary matter. The muon in muonic atoms can either decay or get captured by a proton. Muon capture is very important in heavier muonic atoms, but shortens the muon&#x27;s lifetime from 2.2 μs to only 0.08 μs.

=== Muonic hydrogen ===
Muonic hydrogen is like normal hydrogen with the electron replaced by a negative muon—that is a proton orbited by a muon. It is important in addressing the proton radius puzzle.

=== Muonic helium (Hydrogen-4.1) ===
The symbol 4.1H (Hydrogen-4.1) has been used to describe the exotic atom muonic helium (4He-μ), which is like helium-4 in having two protons and two neutrons. However one of its electrons is replaced by a muon, which also has charge –1. Because the muon&#x27;s orbital radius is less than the electron&#x27;s orbital radius (due to the mass ratio), the muon can be considered as a part of the nucleus. The atom then has a nucleus with two protons, two neutrons and one muon, with total nuclear charge +1 (from two protons and one muon) and only one electron outside, so that it is effectively an isotope of hydrogen instead of an isotope of helium. A muon&#x27;s weight is approximately 0.1 Da so the isotopic mass is 4.1. Since there is only one electron outside the nucleus, the hydrogen-4.1 atom can react with other atoms. Its chemical behavior behaves more like a hydrogen atom than an inert helium atom. 

== Hadronic atoms ==
A &quot;hadronic atom&quot; is an atom in which one or more of the orbital electrons are replaced by a negatively charged hadron. Possible hadrons include mesons such as the pion or kaon, yielding a &quot;pionic atom&quot; or a &quot;kaonic atom&quot; (see Kaonic hydrogen), collectively called &quot;mesonic atoms&quot;; antiprotons, yielding an &quot;antiprotonic atom&quot;; and the particle, yielding a or &quot;sigmaonic atom&quot;.

Unlike leptons, hadrons can interact via the strong force, so the orbitals of hadronic atoms are influenced by nuclear forces between the nucleus and the hadron. Since the strong force is a short-range interaction, these effects are strongest if the atomic orbital involved is close to the nucleus, when the energy levels involved may broaden or disappear because of the absorption of the hadron by the nucleus. Hadronic atoms, such as pionic hydrogen and kaonic hydrogen, thus provide experimental probes of the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics.

== Onium ==
An &quot;onium&quot; (plural: &quot;onia&quot;) is the bound state of a particle and its antiparticle. The classic onium is positronium, which consists of an electron and a positron bound together as a metastable state, with a relatively long lifetime of 142 ns in the triplet state. Positronium has been studied since the 1950s to understand bound states in quantum field theory. A recent development called non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (NRQED) used this system as a proving ground.

Pionium, a bound state of two oppositely charged pions, is useful for exploring the strong interaction. This should also be true of protonium, which is a proton–antiproton bound state. Understanding bound states of pionium and protonium is important in order to clarify notions related to exotic hadrons such as mesonic molecules and pentaquark states. Kaonium, which is a bound state of two oppositely charged kaons, has not been observed experimentally yet.

The true analogs of positronium in the theory of strong interactions, however, are not exotic atoms but certain mesons, the &quot;quarkonium states&quot;, which are made of a heavy quark such as the charm or bottom quark and its antiquark. (Top quarks are so heavy that they decay through the weak force before they can form bound states.) Exploration of these states through non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) and lattice QCD are increasingly important tests of quantum chromodynamics.

Muonium, despite its name, is &quot;not&quot; an onium state containing a muon and an antimuon, because IUPAC assigned that name to the system of an antimuon bound with an electron. However, the production of a muon–antimuon bound state, which &quot;is&quot; an onium (called true muonium), has been theorized. The same applies to the ditauonium (or &quot;true tauonium&quot;) exotic QED atom.

== Hypernuclear atoms ==
Atoms may be composed of electrons orbiting a hypernucleus that includes strange particles called hyperons. Such hypernuclear atoms are generally studied for their nuclear behaviour, falling into the realm of nuclear physics rather than atomic physics.

== Quasiparticle atoms ==
In condensed matter systems, specifically in some semiconductors, there are states called excitons, which are bound states of an electron and an electron hole.

== Exotic molecules ==
An exotic molecule contains one or more exotic atoms.
*Di-positronium, two bound positronium atoms
*Positronium hydride, a positronium atom bound to a hydrogen atom

&quot;Exotic molecule&quot; can also refer to a molecule having some other uncommon property such as pyramidal hexamethylbenzene and a Rydberg atom.

<text>Pionium is a composite particle consisting of one and one meson. It can be created, for instance, by interaction of a proton beam accelerated by a particle accelerator and a target nucleus. Pionium has a short lifetime, predicted by chiral perturbation theory to be (i.e. 2.89 femtoseconds). It decays mainly into two mesons, and to a smaller extent into two photons.

It has been investigated at CERN to measure its lifetime. The Dimeson Relativistic Atomic Complex (DIRAC) experiment at the Proton Synchrotron was able to detect 21,227 atomic pairs from a total of events, which allows the pionium lifetime to be determined to within statistical errors of 9%.&lt;ref name=&quot;hep-ph/9808407&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the NA48/2 collaboration at CERN published an evidence for pionium production and decay in decays of charged kaons, studying mass spectra of daughter pion pairs in the events with three pions in the final state K± → π±(ππ)atom → π±π0π0.&lt;ref name=&quot;hep-ex/0511056&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a precision measurement of the S-wave pion scattering length, published by the collaboration in 2009.

The results of the above experiments will provide crucial tests of low-energy QCD predictions.
