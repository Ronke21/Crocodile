<text>Vanilla Sky is a 2001 American science fiction psychological thriller film directed, written, and co-produced by Cameron Crowe. It is an English-language remake of Alejandro Amenábar&#x27;s 1997 Spanish film &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, which was written by Amenábar and Mateo Gil. The film stars Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Kurt Russell. It follows a magazine publisher who begins to question reality after being disfigured in a car crash.

&quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; grossed over $203 million worldwide against a production budget of $68 million and received mixed critical reception. Diaz&#x27;s performance was widely praised, earning her a Screen Actors Guild and a Golden Globe Award nomination. The song &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; by Paul McCartney was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The film later gained a cult following.

==Plot==

David Aames, the owner of a large publishing company he inherited from his father, is in prison. Wearing a prosthetic mask, David tells his life story to court psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe. In flashbacks, David leaves the duties of the publisher to his father&#x27;s trusted associates while living as a playboy in Manhattan. He is introduced to Sofia Serrano by his best friend, Brian Shelby, during a party.

David and Sofia spend the night together at Sofia&#x27;s apartment and fall in love, unaware that David&#x27;s current lover, Julie Gianni, has followed them there. As David leaves, Julie offers him a ride and soon reveals her jealousy of Sofia. She purposely crashes the car, killing herself and disfiguring David. Doctors cannot repair his face using plastic surgery, forcing David to wear a prosthetic mask, and the mental and physical scarring from the accident causes him to become withdrawn and depressed. David joins Brian and Sofia at a club, but they all leave after David starts an argument while drunk. After David insults them and they part ways, David passes out on the street outside the club.

The next day, Sofia returns and apologizes to David. She takes him home, the two form a relationship and he slowly begins to recover. After surgeons find a way to repair David&#x27;s face despite their prior prognosis, he is plagued by bizarre experiences, such as brief flashbacks of his disfigurement and an encounter with a mysterious man at a bar who informs him that David is omnipotent, demonstrated by the entire bar falling silent at David&#x27;s command. One day, while at Sofia&#x27;s, David awakens to find himself in bed with Julie, whose face has replaced Sofia&#x27;s in their photographs. In shock, he suffocates Julie. David is arrested and imprisoned and his facial disfigurement is mysteriously restored.

McCabe conducts several more interviews, which serve to help David to recall the name &quot;Life Extension&quot;. Seeing a company with that name nearby, McCabe arranges to take David there under guard. Rebecca Dearborn, a company representative, explains how Life Extension uses cryonic suspension to save those with terminal illnesses until a cure can be found, keeping them in a lucid dream state to otherwise exercise their mind. David realizes that he is in cryonic suspension and that the world he inhabits is his lucid dream, which has become a nightmare. He escapes McCabe and the guards while calling for &quot;tech support&quot;, and rushes for the building&#x27;s lobby, which is suddenly empty. An elevator opens, revealing the strange man from the bar. As the elevator climbs to the top of an impossibly tall building, the man explains that he is Tech Support and that David has been in suspension for 150 years.

Unable to face the twin traumas of the loss of his love, Sofia, and his facial injuries, he had opted for Life Extension, to be awakened when technology could repair his face, and left the publishing company in the hands of his father&#x27;s associates, ultimately overdosing on medication and causing Brian to arrange a three-day memorial for him in his home. As part of the program, David had chosen to experience a lucid dream, in which his life would resume the morning after Sofia left him; however, a glitch in the software had caused other elements of his subconscious to distort his dream.

David and Tech Support emerge on the rooftop, high above the clouds. There, Tech Support tells David that while they have corrected the flaw, he now has a choice of either being returned to the dream or being restored to life, requiring a literal leap of faith off the roof that will wake him from his sleep. David chooses the latter, despite McCabe warning him against it. Before jumping, David envisions Brian and Sofia to say his goodbyes. He leaps from the edge of the building, and his life flashes before him. A female voice invites him to open his eyes, and the movie ends with a shot of David&#x27;s eye opening and looking at the audience.

==Production==
===Development===
After the American debut of Alejandro Amenábar&#x27;s 1997 Spanish film &quot;Abre los ojos&quot; (&quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;) at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, Tom Cruise and his producing partner Paula Wagner optioned the remake rights. Hoping to entice director Cameron Crowe, who collaborated with Cruise on &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, Cruise invited Crowe over to his house to view the film. Cruise has stated:

I&#x27;ve been offered a lot of films to buy and remake, and I never have because I felt it was too connected with the culture of that place, whatever country it was from. But this was a universal story that was still open-ended, that still felt like it needed another chapter to be told.
The title of the film is a reference to depictions of skies in certain paintings by Claude Monet. In addition to Monet&#x27;s impressionistic artwork, the film&#x27;s tone was derived from the acoustic ballad &quot;By Way of Sorrow&quot; by Julie Miller and a line from an early interview of Elvis Presley in which he said, &quot;I feel lonely, even in a crowded room.&quot;

===Filming===
Principal photography for &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; began in late 2000 and lasted six weeks. On November 12, 2000, shooting for the scene of the deserted Times Square in New York took place in the early hours of the day. A large section of traffic was blocked off around Times Square while the scene was shot. &quot;There was a limit on how long the city would let us lock everything up even on an early Sunday morning when much of NYC would be slow getting up,&quot; said Steadicam operator Larry McConkey. &quot;Several times we rehearsed with Steadicam and Crane including a mockup of an unmovable guardrail that we had to work the crane arm around. [Cruise] participated in these rehearsals as well so we shared a clear understanding of what my limitations and requirements would be.&quot;

Filming lasted for six weeks around the New York City area, which included scenes in Central Park, the Upper West Side, SoHo, and Brooklyn. One prominent location in the area was the Condé Nast Building that served as Aames Publishing and David&#x27;s office. After filming finished in New York, production moved to Los Angeles, where the remaining interior shots were completed at Paramount Studios. Crowe intentionally left in shots of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks as a tribute.

Despite the film&#x27;s distorted aspects of reality, the style of cinematography remains grounded for much of the film. &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything that was overtly obvious, because the story revolves around the main character not knowing whether he&#x27;s in a state of reality, a dream or a nightmare, so we want it to feel a little ambiguous,&quot; said cinematographer John Toll. &quot;We want the audience to make discoveries as [Cruise]&#x27;s character does, rather than ahead of him.&quot; &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; magazine wrote a feature story on the lighting designer Lee Rose&#x27;s work on the film.

===Alternate ending===
The 2015 Blu-ray release offers the option to watch the film with an alternative ending. This ending expands on the details at the end of the film. While it all leads to the same conclusion, there are additional scenes, alternative takes, and alternative dialogue.

After Rebecca describes the lucid dream, David rushes out of the room but does not immediately dash towards the elevator. He meets McCabe in the restroom who tries to convince him that this is all a hoax and a con and that his case is going to trial. David tells him that he&#x27;s only in his imagination. Much like in the theatrical cut, the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; plays, but this version makes it clear that David hears the music and that he chose it; meanwhile, McCabe tries to convince him there is no music.

At this point, David dashes out of the restroom for the elevator the way he does in the theatrical cut, but the scene in the lobby is expanded: David shoots the police officer who is firing at him and is then surrounded by a SWAT team whom McCabe tries to talk down, but the SWAT team fires at both of them. They black out and wake up in the emptied lobby where McCabe continues to applaud what he believes is a performance while David gets into the elevator with Ventura, who tells him what happened at the end of his real life.

Once they reach the roof, McCabe reenters again and his pleas to David not to believe Ventura become more and more desperate until he collapses onto the ground in despair. David&#x27;s interaction with Sofia is extended as he tells her he loves her but &quot;can&#x27;t settle for a dream&quot;. He then jumps off the building, screaming &quot;I want to wake up!&quot; as images from his life flash before his eyes. He wakes up in bed and a voice tells him &quot;Open your eyes. You&#x27;re going to be fine.&quot;

==Music==
&quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;&#x27;s score was by Crowe&#x27;s then wife, Nancy Wilson, who also scored &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; and &quot;Almost Famous&quot;. Wilson spent nine months on the film&#x27;s music, which was done through experimentation of sound collages. &quot;We were trying to balance out the heaviness of the story with sugary pop-culture music,&quot; she said. &quot;We made sound collages of all kinds. We were channeling Brian Wilson to a large extent. I was recording things through hoses, around corners, playing guitars with cello bows, and with [music editor] Carl Kaller, we tried all kinds of wacky stuff. In the murder–sex scene sound collage, Cameron even used Brian Wilson&#x27;s speaking voice from a &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; mix session.&quot;

Besides the publicly available soundtrack album, Music from Vanilla Sky, the original score was released as a &quot;for your consideration&quot; release for Academy Awards nomination and never released publicly for sale.

The eponymous song from the soundtrack, written and recorded by Paul McCartney, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Additional songs featured included Radiohead&#x27;s song &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot;, and &quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot; by the Icelandic group Sigur Rós.

==Interpretations==
According to Cameron Crowe&#x27;s commentary, there are five different interpretations of the ending:
# &quot;Tech support&quot; is telling the truth: 150 years have passed since Aames killed himself and subsequent events form a lucid dream.
# The entire film is a dream, evidenced by a sticker on Aames&#x27;s car that reads &quot;2/30/01&quot; (February 30 does not occur in the Gregorian calendar).
# The events after the crash are a dream Aames has while comatose.
# The entire film is the plot of the book that Brian is writing.
# The entire film after the crash is a hallucination caused by drugs administered during Aames&#x27;s reconstructive surgery.

Crowe notes that the presence of a &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; during the morning reunion after the nightclub scene marks the first lucid dream scene, and that everything that follows from then on is a dream.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; opened at number one at the box office in the United States when it was first presented on December 14, 2001. The opening weekend took in a gross income of $25,015,518 (24.9%). The final domestic gross income was $100.61 million while the international gross income was slightly higher at $102.76 million for a total worldwide gross income of $203.39 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, 43% of 174 critic reviews are positive and the average rating is 5.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;An ambitious mix of genres, &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; collapses into an incoherent jumble. Cruise&#x27;s performance lacks depth, and it&#x27;s hard to feel sympathy for his narcissistic character.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;D−&quot; on a scale from A to F.

Roger Ebert&#x27;s printed review of &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; awarded the film three out of four stars:

Ebert interpreted the ending as an explanation for &quot;the mechanism of our confusion&quot;, rather than a device that tells &quot;us for sure what actually happened.&quot; Film critic Richard Roeper ranked the film the second best of 2001.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calls &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; a &quot;highly entertaining, erotic science-fiction thriller that takes Mr. Crowe into Steven Spielberg territory&quot;, but then says: &quot;As it leaves behind the real world and begins exploring life as a waking dream (this year&#x27;s most popular theme in Hollywood movies with lofty ideas), &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; loosens its emotional grip and becomes a disorganised and abstract if still-intriguing meditation on parallel themes. One is the quest for eternal life and eternal youth; another is guilt and the ungovernable power of the unconscious mind to undermine science&#x27;s utopian discoveries. David&#x27;s redemption ultimately consists of his coming to grips with his own mortality, but that redemption lacks conviction.&quot;

Salon.com called &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; an &quot;aggressively plotted puzzle picture, which clutches many allegedly deep themes to its heaving bosom without uncovering even an onion-skin layer of insight into any of them.&quot; The review rhetorically asks: &quot;Who would have thought that Cameron Crowe had a movie as bad as &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; in him? It&#x27;s a punishing picture, a betrayal of everything that Crowe has proved he knows how to do right. ... But the disheartening truth is that we can see Crowe taking all the right steps, the most Crowe-like steps, as he mounts a spectacle that overshoots boldness and ambition and idiosyncrasy and heads right for arrogance and pretension—and those last two are traits I never would have thought we&#x27;d have to ascribe to Crowe.&quot; Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film 2/4 and wrote: &quot;The film&#x27;s aim—to dazzle and inspire—is sapped by Cruise&#x27;s vein-popping, running-the-marathon performance.&quot;

Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Gareth Von Kallenbach of the publication &quot;Film Threat&quot; compared &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; unfavorably to &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;. Bradshaw says &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; is &quot;certainly more distinctive than&quot; &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, which he describes as an &quot;extraordinarily narcissistic high-concept vanity project for producer-star Tom Cruise.&quot; Other reviewers extrapolate from the knowledge that Cruise had bought the rights to do a version of Amenábar&#x27;s film. A &quot;Village Voice&quot; reviewer characterized &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; as &quot;hauntingly frank about being a manifestation of its star&#x27;s cosmic narcissism&quot;.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Cameron Diaz &quot;compelling as the embodiment of crazed sensuality&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer said she gives a &quot;ferociously emotional&quot; performance. Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; similarly says of the film, &quot;most impressive is Cameron Diaz, whose fatal-attraction stalker is both heartbreaking and terrifying.&quot; For her performance, Diaz won multiple critics&#x27; groups awards, as well as being nominated for the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award, Saturn Award, and AFI Award. Penélope Cruz&#x27;s performance earned her a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress (in addition to her roles in &quot;Blow&quot; and &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot;).

<text>A brocard is a legal maxim in Latin that is, in a strict sense, derived from traditional legal authorities, even from ancient Rome.

==History==

According to the dictionaries, the word is a variant of the Latinized name of Burchard of Worms (died AD 1025), Bishop of Worms, Germany, who compiled 20 volumes of &quot;Ecclesiastical Rules&quot;, although some sources disagree. Begun in AD 1008, the materials took Burchard four years to compile. He wrote it while living in a small structure on top of a hill in the forest outside Worms, after his defeat of Duke Otto and while raising his adopted child. The collection, which he called the &quot;Collectarium Canonum&quot; or &quot;Decretum&quot;, became a primary source for canon law.

Along with numerous documents from a variety of sources, including the Old Testament and Saint Augustine of Hippo, Burchard included the &quot;Canon Episcopi&quot; in this collection, under the belief that it dated from an episcopal &quot;Council of Anquira&quot; in AD 314, but no other evidence of this council exists. Because of this inclusion, Burchard has been described as something of a rationalist. As the source of canon law, Burchard&#x27;s &quot;Decretum&quot; was supplanted around 1150 by the , a much larger collection that further attempted to reconcile contradictory elements of canon law.

Burchard spent the years 1023 to 1025 promulgating &quot;Leges et Statuta Familiae S. Petri Wormatiensis&quot;, a collection of religious laws he endorsed as just and hoped to have officially approbated.

Spargo points out that early compilations of brocards sometimes contained miscellaneous trivia in Latin, and a hard association of the term &quot;brocard&quot; with a legal maxim came later. As an example, he quotes a 1521 work published in Toulouse: (a bookcase is a place where the books are returned).

Although the Romans first came to Britain in 55 BC, Roman Law has had negligible influence on English common law. Latin legal phrases are used in English only because Latin was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Medieval era. Although some of these phrases are in common use in law, such as &quot;res ipsa loquitur&quot;, &quot;novus actus interveniens&quot;, &quot;talem qualem&quot;, &quot;de minimis non curat lex&quot;, and &quot;consensus ad idem&quot;, the common law is not premised on the principles of civil law, and their use is being replaced by that of vernacular substitutes. For example, &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; previously included numerous brocards among its entries.

Although the Romans did not conquer Scotland, Scots Law is a mixed legal system in which &quot;brocards are regarded as part of the common law&quot;.

=== Etymology ===

Multiple sources, including the Oxford English Dictionary, derive the term from the name of Bishop Burkhardt, although contemporaneous Medieval Latin spelling was typically &quot;Burkhardus&quot;. Spargo in 1948 pointed out that Friedrich Carl von Savigny, an 18th century authority on canon law, declared association to be solely due to a similarity in sound, and stated that the origin of the term is &quot;very uncertain&quot;. So did the Encyclopédie des sciences ecclésiastiques in 1937.

==Examples==

;&quot;Consuetudo pro lege servatur&quot; : &quot;Custom is held as law.&quot; Where no laws apply to a given situation, the customs of the place and time will have the force of law.
;&quot;Contra non valentem agere nulla&quot; [or &quot;non&quot;] &quot;currit praescriptio&quot; : A statute of limitation does not run against those who cannot act; this is the basis of the American discovery rule limiting prescriptive limitation periods.
;&quot;Cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos&quot; : &quot;Whoever&#x27;s is the soil, all the way to heaven and to the depths is theirs.&quot; Used in reference to the rights of property owners to the air above, and land below, their property.

;&quot;De minimis non curat lex&quot; : &quot;The law does not concern itself with the smallest things&quot;. There must be a minimal level of substance or impact in order to bring a legal action.
;&quot;Dubia in meliorem partem interpretari debent&quot; : &quot;Doubtful things should be interpreted in the best way.&quot; Often spoken as &quot;to give the benefit of the doubt&quot;.
;&quot;Dura lex, sed lex&quot; : &quot;The law [is] harsh, but [it is] the law.&quot; It follows from the principle of the rule of law that even draconian laws must be followed and enforced; if one disagrees with the result, one must seek to change the law.

;&quot;In claris non fit interpretatio&quot; : &quot;In clear things no interpretation is made.&quot; When a rule is clearly intelligible, there is no need of proposing a (usually extensive) interpretation.
;&quot;Inadimplenti non est adimplendum&quot; : &quot;One has no need to respect his obligation if the counter-party has not respected his own.&quot; This is used in civil law to briefly indicate a principle (adopted in some systems) referred to as the synallagmatic contract.
;&quot;Inter arma enim silent leges&quot; : &quot;For among arms, the laws fall silent.&quot; A concept that during war, many illegal activities occur. Also taken to mean that in times of war, laws are suppressed, ostensibly for the good of the country.
;&quot;Iudex non calculat&quot; : &quot;The judge does not calculate.&quot; A principle that calculation errors made by the court do not invalidate the judgement on a technicality. Also taken to mean that the judge does not tally up the arguments of both sides and decide in favor of the more numerous, but rather weighs all of the evidence without regard to the number of arguments made.
;&quot;Iura novit curia&quot; : &quot;The court knows the law.&quot; Concept that parties to a case do not need to define how the law applies to their case. The court is solely responsible for determining what laws apply.

;&quot;Maleficia propositis distinguuntur&quot; : &quot;Evil acts are distinguished from (evil) purposes&quot; or &quot;crimes are distinguished by evil intent&quot;.
;&quot;Nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans&quot; : &quot;No one can be heard, who invokes his own guilt.&quot; Nobody can bring a case that stems from their own illegal act.
; &quot;Nemo dat quod non habet&quot;: &quot;No one gives what they do not have.&quot; The basic rule that a person who does not own property (e.g. a thief) cannot confer it on another except with the true owner&#x27;s authority (i.e. as his agent). Exceptions to this rule include sales under statutory powers, and cases where the doctrine of estoppel prevents a legal owner from denying a seller&#x27;s right to sell.
;&quot;Nemo debet esse iudex in propria&quot; : &quot;No one shall be a judge in his own case.&quot; In the past it was thought that it included just two rules, namely (1) &quot;nemo iudex in causa sua&quot; (no one shall be a judge in his own case).
;&quot;Nemo ius ignoratur censetur&quot; : &quot;Not knowing the law is harmful.&quot; Everyone should know the law. This is used in European Law-countries with a history of Roman law; the &#x27;sentence&#x27; was first made by Aristotle.
;&quot;Nemo judex in sua causa&quot; : &quot;No one shall be a judge in his own case.&quot; Prevents conflict of interest in courts. Often invoked when there is really no conflict, but when there is even the appearance of one.
;&quot;Nemo plus iuris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse habet&quot; : &quot;No one can transfer a greater right than he himself has.&quot; A purchaser of stolen goods will not become the rightful owner thereof, since the seller himself was not the owner to begin with.
;&quot;Non faciat malum, ut inde veniat bonum&quot; : &quot;Not to do evil that good may come.&quot; Performing some illegal action is not excused by the fact that a positive result came therefrom. Often used to argue that some forms of expression, such as graffiti or pornographic films, cannot be given the protection of law (e.g. copyright) as they are or may be considered illegal or morally reprehensible.
;&quot;Nulla poena sine culpa&quot;: &quot;No punishment without fault.&quot; A person can not be punished for a crime that they are not guilty of.
;&quot;Nulla poena sine lege&quot; or &quot;nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali&quot; : &quot;No penalty without law&quot; or &quot;no crime, no punishment without a previous penal law&quot;. (1) One cannot be prosecuted for doing something that is not prohibited by law. (2) One cannot be prosecuted for doing something that was not prohibited by law at the time and place it was committed, notwithstanding laws made since that time. A form of prohibition on retroactive laws.
;&quot;Nunc pro tunc&quot;: &quot;Now for then.&quot; The form of a current order intended to be effective retroactively.
;&quot;Pacta sunt servanda&quot;: &quot;Agreements are to be kept.&quot; Contracts are the law &quot;or&quot; contracts establish obligations (between those who sign them).
;&quot;Par in parem non habet imperium&quot;: &quot;Equals have no sovereignty over each other.&quot;
;&quot;Prior tempore potior iure&quot; : &quot;Earlier in time, stronger in right.&quot; &quot;The law favors those who establish their rights earlier rather than later.&quot;
;&quot;Prius quam exaudias ne iudices&quot; : &quot;Before you hear, do not judge.&quot;
;&quot;Probatio vincit praesumptionem&quot; : &quot;Proof overcomes presumption.&quot;
;&quot;Prout patet per recordum&quot; : &quot;As appears in the record&quot;. Used to cite something that has already been admitted into the record. It was frequently used in pleadings, generally abbreviated &quot;prout &amp;c.&quot;, to indicate that a fact was supported by documentary evidence. Failure to use this phrase correctly could be a fatal defect and so cause a case to fail.
;&quot;Qui facit per alium facit per se&quot; : &quot;Who acts through another, acts himself.&quot; One who delegates a task to another, takes full responsibility for the performance of that act as if he himself had done it. Basis for the law of agency.
;&quot;Quod est necessarium est licitum&quot; : &quot;What is necessary is lawful.&quot;
; &quot;Quod non est in registro, non est in Mundo&quot; : &quot;What is not in the register is not in the world.&quot; What is not reported in the (related, referring) registry, has no legal relevance. Used when a formal act (usually a recording or a transcription) is required in order to give consistence, content or efficacy to a right.
;&quot;Res ipsa loquitur&quot; : &quot;The thing speaks for itself.&quot; Used in tort/delict law when there is no proof of what caused the harm, but it is most likely only the thing that could have caused the harm.
; &quot;Res inter alios acta vel iudicata, aliis nec nocet nec prodocet&quot; : What has been agreed/decided between people (a specific group) can neither benefit nor harm a third party (meaning: two or more people cannot agree amongst each other to establish an obligation for a third party who was not involved in the negotiation; furthermore, any benefit that may be established will have to be accepted by the third party before it can be implemented).
;&quot;Rex non potest peccare&quot; : &quot;The king can do no wrong.&quot; Used to describe the basis for sovereign immunity.
;&quot;Salus populi suprema lex esto&quot; : &quot;The good of the people shall be the supreme law.&quot; Used variously as a motto, a reminder, or a notion of how the law and governments in general should be.
; &quot;Sententia quae in rem iudicatam transit, pro veritate habetur&quot; : When a definitive sentence is declared, it is considered to be the truth. In the case of a sentence &quot;in rem iudicatam&quot; (that finally consents to consider a judgement completed), its content will then be the only legally relevant consideration of a fact.
;&quot;Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas&quot; : &quot;Use your property so as not to injure that of your neighbours.&quot; While an individual is entitled to the use and enjoyment of one&#x27;s estate, the right is not without limits. Restrictions can give rise to tort/delict actions including trespass, negligence, and nuisance.
; &quot;Solve et repete&quot; : &quot;Solve and resume.&quot; Respect your obligation first, then you can ask for reimbursement. Used in those situations in which one of the two (or more) parties needs to complete his obligation before being allowed to ask for the opposite obligation to be respected by his counter party. Usually this principle is used in fields and subjects in which a certain general steadiness or uniformity of the system is considered a particularly relevant value. The case is typical of service contracts with repeated obligations (like with gas, water, electricity providers and similars), in which irregularities on one side cannot be balanced if not in a regular situation (i.e., of payments) on the other side. The customer, for example, might be asked to pay regularly the new bill, before contesting the previous one in which he found irregular calculations, and asking for a balancement with newer bills; he thus cannot by himself determine a discount in the next payment.
; &quot;Ubi lex voluit, dixit; ubi noluit, tacuit&quot; : &quot;When the law wills, it speaks; when it does not will, it is silent.&quot; When the law wants to regulate a matter in further detail, it does regulate the matter; when it does not want to regulate a matter in further detail, it remained silent.
;&quot;Ultra posse nemo obligatur&quot; : &quot;No one is obligated (to do) more than he can.&quot; Specifies that one should do what he can to support the community, but since everyone has different levels of ability, it cannot be expected that all will perform the same.
;&quot;Vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit&quot; : &quot;Equity aids the vigilant, not the sleeping.&quot; Concept that if an opposing party unreasonably delays bringing an action, that it is no longer considered just to hear their claim, due to fundamental changes in circumstance brought on by their delay.
;&quot;Volenti non fit injuria&quot; : &quot;Injury is not done to the willing.&quot; Notion that a person cannot bring a claim against another for injury, if said person willingly placed themselves in a situation where they knew injury could result.

<doc id="54033" wikidata="Q730326" url="?curid=54033" title="List of horse breeds">
<text>The following list of horse and pony breeds includes standardized breeds, some strains within breeds that are considered distinct populations, types of horses with common characteristics that are not necessarily standardized breeds but are sometimes described as such, and terms that describe groupings of several breeds with similar characteristics.

While there is no single definition of the term &quot;breed&quot;, it can be defined as a population sharing common ancestry, which has been subjected to similar selection objectives, and which conforms to certain established “breed standards”. Its members may be called &quot;purebred&quot;. In most cases, bloodlines of horse breeds are recorded with a breed registry. The concept is somewhat flexible in horses, as open stud books are created for recording pedigrees of horse breeds that are not yet fully true-breeding.

Registries are considered the authority as to whether a given breed is listed as a &quot;horse&quot; or a &quot;pony&quot;. There are also a number of &quot;color breed&quot;, sport horse, and gaited horse registries for horses with various phenotypes or other traits, which admit any animal fitting a given set of physical characteristics, even if there the trait is not a true-breeding characteristic. Other recording entities or specialty organizations may recognize horses from multiple breeds, or are recording designer crossbreds. Such animals may be classified here as a breed, a crossbreed, or a &quot;type”, depending on the stage of breed recognition.

== Horse breeds ==

In some cultures and for some competition-sanctioning organizations, a horse that normally matures less than about 145 cm or when fully grown may be classified as a &quot;pony&quot;. However, unless the principal breed registry or breed standard describes the breed as a pony, it is listed in this section, even if some or all representatives are small or have some pony characteristics. Ponies are listed in the section below.

=== A–C ===
=== D–K ===
=== L–R ===
=== S–Z ===
== Pony breeds ==

If a breed is described as a &quot;pony&quot; by the breed standard or principal breed registry, it is listed in this section, even if some individuals have horse characteristics. All other breeds are listed in the section above.

(Because of this designation by the preference of a given breed registry, most miniature horse breeds are listed as &quot;horses&quot;, not ponies.)

=== A–K ===
=== L–Z ===
== Color &quot;breeds&quot; ==

There are some registries that accept horses (and sometimes ponies and mules) of almost any breed or type for registration. Color is either the only criterion for registration or the primary criterion. These are called &quot;color breeds&quot;, because unlike &quot;true&quot; horse breeds, there are few other physical requirements, nor is the stud book limited in any fashion. As a general rule, the color also does not always breed on (in some cases due to genetic impossibility), and offspring without the stated color are usually not eligible for recording with the color breed registry. There are breeds that have color that usually breeds &quot;true&quot; as well as distinctive physical characteristics and a limited stud book. These horses are true breeds that have a preferred color, not color breeds, and include the Friesian horse, the Cleveland Bay, the Appaloosa, and the American Paint Horse.

The best-known &quot;color breed&quot; registries that accept horses from many different breeds are for the following colors:
* Buckskin: a color which cannot breed &quot;true&quot; due to the cream gene which creates it being an incomplete dominant
* Palomino: a color which cannot breed &quot;true&quot; due to the cream gene which creates it being an incomplete dominant
* Pinto: there exists a registry for Pinto-colored horses of varying breeds, distinct from the American Paint Horse registry, though some qualifying horses may be registered in both. 
* White: some of these animals are registered in the United States with the American creme and white horse registry, which was once called an &quot;Albino&quot; registry until it was understood that true albino does not exist in horses. (&quot;see White (horse) and Dominant white for details&quot;)

==Crossbred registration==
The distinction is hotly debated between a standardized breed, a developing breed with an open studbook, a registry of recognized crossbred horses, and a designer crossbred. For the purposes of this list, certain groups of horses that have an organization or registry that records individual animals for breeding purposes, at least in some nations, but does not clearly fall to either the breed or type categories are listed here.
This list does not include organizations that record horses strictly for competition purposes. 

== Types of horse ==

A &quot;type&quot; of horse is not a breed but is used here to categorize groups of horses or horse breeds that are similar in appearance (phenotype) or use. A type usually has no breed registry, and often encompasses several breeds. However, in some nations, particularly in Europe, there is a recording method or means of studbook selection for certain types to allow them to be licensed for breeding. Horses of a given type may be registered as one of several different recognized breeds, or a grouping may include horses that are of no particular pedigree but meet a certain standard of appearance or use.

=== Modern types ===
=== Archaic types ===
Prior to approximately the 13th century, few pedigrees were written down, and horses were classified by physical type or use. Thus, many terms for Horses in the Middle Ages did not refer to breeds as we know them today, but rather described appearance or purpose. These terms included:

* Charger, &quot;see&quot; Courser (horse)
* Courser (horse)
* Destrier &quot;or&quot; &quot;Great Horse&quot;
* Hobby, &quot;see&quot; Irish Hobby
* Jennet, sometimes called Spanish Jennet
* Palfrey
* Rouncey
* Steppe horse, refers to various domesticated horse and wild horse species, particularly those from Siberia and other parts of western Asia

== Extinct breeds == 

Many breeds of horse have become extinct, either because they have died out, or because they have been absorbed into another breed:

<doc id="54034" wikidata="Q5255148" url="?curid=54034" title="Misnay–Schardin effect">
<text>The Misnay–Schardin effect, or platter effect, is a characteristic of the detonation of a broad sheet of explosive.

== Description ==
Explosive blasts expand directly away from, and perpendicular to, the surface of an explosive. Unlike the blast from a rounded explosive charge, which expands in all directions, the blast produced by an explosive sheet expands primarily perpendicular to its plane, in both directions. However, if one side is backed by a heavy or fixed mass, most of the blast (i.e. most of the rapidly expanding gas and its kinetic energy) will be reflected in the direction away from the mass.

== Uses ==
The Misnay–Schardin effect was studied and experimented with by explosive experts József Misnay (sometimes spelled Misznay incorrectly), a Hungarian, and Hubert Schardin, a German, who initially sought to develop a more effective antitank mine for Nazi Germany. Some sources claim that World War II ended before their design became usable, but they and others continued their work. Misnay designed two weapons: the 43M TAK antitank mine and the 44M LŐTAK side-attack mine. The Hungarian army used these weapons in 1944–1945.

The later AT2 and M18 Claymore mines rely on this effect.

<doc id="54035" wikidata="Q604971" url="?curid=54035" title="Jus soli">
<text>Jus soli ( , ), meaning &#x27;right of soil&#x27;, is the right of anyone born in the territory of a state to nationality or citizenship. &quot;Jus soli&quot; was part of the English common law, in contrast to &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; (&#x27;right of blood&#x27;) associated with the French Civil Code of 1803.

&quot;Jus soli&quot; is the predominant rule in the Americas; explanations for this geographical phenomenon include: the establishment of lenient laws by past European colonial powers to entice immigrants from the Old World and displace native populations in the New World, along with the emergence of successful wars of independence movements that widened the definition and granting of citizenship, as a prerequisite to the abolishment of slavery since the 19th century.

The United States is 1 of 33 countries that provides citizenship unconditionally to anyone born within its national borders. Some countries outside the Americas with mixed systems extend &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship on a limited basis to children who are not otherwise eligible for any national citizenship, such as children born to women who are unwed or from countries that do not recognize maternal &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; citizenship. Others impose a residency requirement requiring parents to live in the country for a certain number of years before children born in the country become eligible for conditional &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship. These mixed systems were implemented to fulfill treaty obligations after the atrocities of World War II increased awareness about the vulnerability of stateless persons.

== Background ==
Jus soli, sometimes called &quot;lex soli&quot;, is the principle of citizenship acquired by the place of birth. Children born to a parent in the diplomatic or consular service of another state are often not eligble for &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship in a host State.

Unconditional &quot;jus soli&quot; is mostly found in the Americas. Some countries outside the Americas with mixed systems extend &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship on a limited basis to children who are not otherwise eligible for any national citizenship, such as children born to women who are unwed or from countries do not recognize maternal &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; citizenship. Others impose a residency requirement requiring parents to live in the country for a certain number of years before children born in the country become eligble for conditional &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship. UNHCR gives ten reasons for why people become stateless including laws related to marriage, administrative practices, renunciation of citizenship and nationality laws that discriminate on the basis of gender.

===Reduction of Statelessness===

Countries that have acceded to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness are obligated to grant nationality to people born in their territory who would otherwise become stateless persons. These mixed systems were implemented to fulfill treaty obligations after the atrocities of World War II increased awareness about the vulnerability of stateless persons.

The American Convention on Human Rights similarly provides that &quot;Every person has the right to the nationality of the state in whose territory he was born if he does not have the right to any other nationality.&quot;

===Birthright citizenship===

The &quot;New Oxford American Dictionary&quot; defines birthright citizenship as &quot;a legal right to citizenship for all children born in a country&#x27;s territory, regardless of parentage&quot;. In the United States &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; is not a constitutional right or a birth right. Citizenship by &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; is a legal status conferred by statute. The term birthright citizenship usually means &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship.

Birthright citizenship is rooted in colonial history when settlers born in the colonial United States were considered &quot;natural born&quot; subjects of the King of England. The idea of conferring citizenship based on being born within the borders of the United States comes from this history. Allegiance based on natural law principles was the core concept of citizenship in &quot;Calvin&#x27;s Case&quot; in which Edward Coke said that &quot;they that are born under the obedience, power, faith, ligealty or ligeance of the King are natural subjects and no aliens&quot;. The American concept of citizenship is derived from republican principles and may have been influenced by the French writer Emer de Vattel.

* : Subsection 3(2) of the Citizenship Act states that Canadian citizenship by birth in Canada – including Canadian airspace and territorial waters – is granted to a child born in Canada even if neither parent was a Canadian citizen or permanent resident except if either parent was a diplomat, in service to a diplomat, or employed by an international agency of equal status to a diplomat. However, if neither parent was a diplomat, the nationality or immigration status of the parents do not matter. Some Conservative Party members wish to end birthright citizenship in Canada to the children of tourists and illegal immigrants.
* : &quot;Jus soli&quot; requires registration with the Costa Rican government before the age of 25.

* Mexico: Article 30 of the Constitution of Mexico states that persons born in Mexican territory are natural-born citizens of Mexico regardless of their parents&#x27; nationality. The definition of &quot;territory&quot; includes vessels/aircraft flagged to Mexico travelling in international waters or airspace.

* United States: The Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1868, provides: &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&quot; The concept of birthright citizenship applying to the child born of a foreign national in the country without proper credentials has never been formally litigated, but the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot; (1898) allowed the government to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children only in the cases of children born to foreign diplomats and children born to enemy forces engaged in hostile occupation of the country&#x27;s territory, and, thus, this decision is most often interpreted as barring the government from denying citizenship to those born in the U.S. based on the alienage of their parents. (See United States nationality law.)

: On 20 January 2025, President Donald Trump as part of his Agenda 47 signed an executive order aiming to end the practice of birthright citizenship. The order mandates for at least one parent to be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for persons born in the U.S to become U.S. citizens at birth going forward. The order was scheduled to come into effect on February 19, but on January 23 a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked its enforcement for 14 days after referring it as unconstitutional. On February 6 the judge in Seattle further extended his temporary restraint on the order by blocking it indefinitely. Within hours the Justice Department appealed his decision to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 19 the court of appeals declined to lift the hold that the Seattle judge had placed on the order, after concluding that the order ran afoul of the constitution. Four federal judges have blocked the order. Also lawsuits from individuals, organizations, and twenty two states suing to block the order as well are still pending elsewhere.

* Pakistan: Under the Pakistan Citizenship Act of 1951 passed by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 13 April 1951 permits everyone born in Pakistan on or after that date to automatically receive Pakistani citizenship by birth except if they are the child of a foreign diplomat or enemy alien. On 11 November 2024 the National Assembly of Pakistan passed a bill to restrict citizenship for children born to foreigners. The bill would amend the Pakistan Citizenship Act of 1951 and would change the citizenship law by requiring every person born in Pakistan on or after 13 April 1951 to have at least one parent that is a citizen or a permanent resident of Pakistan in order to be granted Pakistani citizenship by birth or live in Pakistan for a period of 10 years from the date of their birth.
== Restricted &quot;jus soli&quot; ==
There is a trend in some countries toward restricting &quot;jus soli&quot; by requiring that at least one of the child&#x27;s parents be a citizen, national or legal permanent resident of the state in question at time of the child&#x27;s birth. Modification of &quot;jus soli&quot; has been criticized as contributing to economic inequality, the perpetuation of unfree labour from a helot underclass and statelessness. &quot;Jus soli&quot; has been restricted in the following countries:

=== Africa ===
* : According to the nationality law of the Arab Republic of Egypt and its latest amendments, children born to an Egyptian father or an Egyptian mother acquire citizenship at birth, regardless of their place of birth. Additionally, children born in Egypt to unknown parents (or found abandoned at a young age) are granted citizenship at birth.
* : A person who was born in Morocco to parents also born in Morocco and whose immigration is legal, can register as a Moroccan two years prior to becoming adult.
* : A person born in Namibia to a Namibian citizen parent or a foreign parent who is ordinarily resident in Namibia, is a Namibian citizen at birth (see Namibian nationality law).
* : A person born in São Tomé and Príncipe acquires São Toméan nationality, as long as the parents are residents of the country. The only exception is if any of the parents have diplomatic immunity (see São Toméan nationality law).
* : Since 6 October 1995, a person born in South Africa to South African citizens or permanent residents is automatically granted South African citizenship (see South African nationality law).
* : A person born before 1994 gains Sudanese nationality at birth if his father was also born in Sudan. If his father was not born in Sudan, they can apply to the Minister to be granted Sudanese nationality.
* : The Tanzania Citizenship Act of 1995, states that &quot;any child born within the borders of the United Republic of Tanzania, on or after Union Day, 26 April 1964, is granted citizenship of Tanzania, except for children of a father who has diplomatic immunity, or parents who were enemy aliens and the territory was under enemy occupation.&quot; While Tanzania technically observes birthright citizenship, it is official practice that birth in Tanzania has to be further supported by descent from a Tanzanian parent to be recognized as a citizen by birth. This practice has gone uncontested in courts of law.
* : Individuals born in Tunisia are citizens by birth if their father and grandfather were born in Tunisia. Additionally, the person must declare before becoming an adult (20 years) that they want to be a citizen.

=== North America ===
* : The constitution was amended on 26 January 2010. The amendment broadened the definition of the 2004 migration law – which excluded from citizenship children born to individuals that were &quot;in transit&quot; – to include &quot;non-residents&quot; (including individuals with expired residency visas and undocumented workers).

=== South America ===
* : Article 96 of the constitution grants Colombian nationality by birth provided that at least one of the parents is a Colombian national or a legal resident. By presidential decree, in August 2019 nationality was granted to children of Venezuelan migrants born in Colombia regardless of residential status of their parents.

=== Asia ===
* : Article 52 of the constitution of Azerbaijan mentions that a person born on the territory of Azerbaijan is a citizen of Azerbaijan. Although in practice that provision is not enforced and persons are only granted citizenship by right based on the other provision within the article that mentions a person whose one parent is a citizen of Azerbaijan is also a citizen of Azerbaijan.
* : Children born to a foreign father with valid residency permits who himself was born in Bahrain have right to citizenship.
* : In 1996, Cambodia changed the law to grant citizenship to children born to foreign parents if both parents were born in Cambodia and are living legally in Cambodia (under Article 4(2)(a) of the 1996 Nationality Law).
*: China has strict nationality laws that limit &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship to children born to stateless parents who have settled in China.
* Hong Kong: Since the July 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, most political rights and eligibility for most benefits are conferred to permanent residents regardless of citizenship. Conversely, PRC citizens who are not permanent residents (such as residents of Mainland China and Macao) are not conferred these rights and privileges. The Basic Law provides that all citizens of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) born in the territory are permanent residents of the territory and have the right of abode in Hong Kong. The 2001 case &quot;Director of Immigration v. Chong Fung Yuen&quot; clarified that the parents need not have right of abode and as a consequence many women from Mainland China began coming to Hong Kong to give birth. By 2008, the number of babies in the territory born to Mainland China mothers had grown to twenty-five times the number five years prior. Furthermore, persons of Chinese ethnicity (wholly or partly) with PRC nationality born in Hong Kong are PRC nationals with Hong Kong permanent residence, even if their parents are non-PRC citizens (e.g. overseas-born Chinese). Non-PRC citizens born to non-PRC citizen Hong Kong permanent resident parents in Hong Kong also receive permanent residence of Hong Kong at birth. Other persons must have &quot;ordinarily resided&quot; in Hong Kong for seven continuous years in order to gain permanent residence (Articles 24(2) and 24(5)).
* : Indonesian citizenship by birth includes those born anywhere whose parents are both Indonesian nationals, or any person born in Indonesia with at least one Indonesian citizen parent, or a child born in Indonesia to unknown parents, or those born out of wedlock. Citizenship can also be granted to a permanent resident who has lived in Indonesia for a given period of time through naturalization, as long as the parents are stateless, or unknown.
* : Article 976(4) of the Civil Code of Iran grants citizenship at birth to persons born in Iran of foreign parents if one or both of the parents were themselves born in Iran. Article 976(5) People born in Iran of a father of foreign nationality who have resided at least one more year in Iran immediately after reaching the full age of 18; in other cases their naturalization as Iranian subjects will be subject to the stipulations for Iranian naturalization laid down by the law. New legislation passed by the Iranian Parliament in 2012 grants permanent residency to children born to Iranian mothers and foreign fathers. See Iranian nationality law.
* : Children born in Israel who have never acquired another citizenship are eligible to apply for Israeli citizenship between their 18th and 21st birthday if they have lived in Israel for over 5 years (see Israeli citizenship law).
* : Children born in Japan to stateless or unknown parents are Japanese nationals at birth.
* Macau: Similar to Hong Kong, most political rights and eligibility for most benefits are conferred to permanent residents regardless of citizenship since the December 1999 transfer of sovereignty over Macau, according to the Basic Law of Macau. Becoming a Macau permanent resident has slightly different requirements depending on an individual&#x27;s nationality. Acquisition by birth operates on a modified &quot;jus soli&quot; basis; individuals born in Macau to Chinese nationals or to Portuguese citizens domiciled there are automatically permanent residents, while those born to other foreign nationals must have at least one parent who possesses right of abode (see Right of abode in Macau).&lt;ref name=&quot;L8/1999A1&quot;&gt; Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* : A person born in Malaysia on or after 16 September 1963 with at least one parent being a Malaysian citizen or permanent resident is automatically a Malaysian citizen (see Malaysian nationality law).
* Mongolia: A person born in Mongolia to foreign parents with valid residency permits can apply for Mongolian nationality when they turn the age of 16. A child in Mongolian territory with unidentified parents can receive Mongolian citizenship (see Mongolian nationality law).
* : Any child born to parents with Taiwanese citizenship, even those living abroad, can acquire Taiwanese nationality at birth. Children born in Taiwan to stateless parents or have unknown parentage are considered Taiwanese nationals at birth (see Taiwanese nationality law).
* : Thailand operated a system of pure &quot;jus soli&quot; prior to 1972. Due to illegal immigration from Burma, the Nationality Act was amended by requiring both parents to legally reside and be domiciled in Thailand for at least five years for their child to be granted Thai citizenship at birth. Furthermore, someone who has Thai citizenship by sole virtue of &quot;jus soli&quot; may be stripped of Thai citizenship under various conditions (such as living abroad), which does not apply to people who have Thai citizenship by virtue of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;.

=== Europe ===
* : Children born in France (including overseas territories) to at least one parent who is either (i) a French national or (ii) born in France, are automatically granted French nationality at birth. Children born in France to foreign parents who do not fulfil either of these two conditions may acquire citizenship from age 13 subject to residence conditions (see French nationality law). A child born in France to foreign parents becomes a French citizen automatically upon turning 18, provided that they reside in France on their 18th birthday and have had their primary residence in France for a total (but not necessarily continuous) period of at least 5 years since the age of 11. Children born in France to two stateless parents receive French nationality automatically at birth.
* : Prior to 2000, Germany&#x27;s nationality law was based entirely on &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;, but now children born in Germany on or after 1 January 2000 to non-German parents acquire German citizenship at birth if at least one parent has a permanent residence permit and resided in Germany for at least five years prior to the child&#x27;s birth.
* Greece: Apart from regulations in past and historic nationality laws of Greece granting nationality &quot;jus soli&quot;, the Greek Nationality Code of 2004 states that &quot;A person born in Greek territory acquires by birth the Greek nationality if not acquiring alien nationality or is of unknown nationality&quot;. Additionally, as from 2015&#x27;s amendment of 2004 Code (Law 4332 of 2015, G.G. A/76/9 July 2015), a child born in Greece by foreign parents shall acquire the right of Greek nationality with a combination of primary school attendance and parents&#x27; legal residence in Greece (5 years, 10 if the child is born prior to 5 years of legal residence). One year after the implementation of the law (as from July 2016), 6,029 children had been granted Greek nationality, out of 27,720 submitted applications.
* : On 1 January 2005, the law was amended to require that at least one of the parents be an Irish citizen; a British citizen; a resident with a permanent right to reside in Ireland or in Northern Ireland; or a legal resident residing three of the last four years in the country (excluding students and asylum seekers) (see Irish nationality law). The amendment was prompted by the case of Man Chen, a Chinese woman living in mainland United Kingdom who traveled to Belfast (Northern Ireland, part of the UK) to give birth in order to benefit from the previous rule whereby anyone born on any part of the island of Ireland was automatically granted Irish citizenship. The Chinese parents used their daughter&#x27;s Irish (and thereby European Union) citizenship to obtain permanent residence in the UK as parents of a dependent EU citizen. Ireland was the last country in Europe to abolish unrestricted &quot;jus soli&quot;. (see Irish nationality law).
* : The law that regulates this right is n. 91 of 5 February 1992. Article 4 paragraph 2 grants this possibility to a person born in Italy, who has legally resided there without interruption until reaching the age of 18, and becomes a citizen if they declare that they wish to acquire Italian citizenship within one year from the aforementioned date. They can make use of this right by submitting a simple declaration of will to the Civil Status Office of their municipality of residence. It is important to know that the Municipality of belonging is required, according to article 33 of Law 98/2013, to inform foreign citizens, during the 6 months preceding the age of 18, of the possibility of applying for Italian citizenship by the age of 19. In the absence of such communication, the request can be made even after the age of 19. In the event that, despite having been born in Italy, one has not had continuous residence from birth, but has resided in Italy for at least three years, at the age of 18, the application can be presented at the Prefecture with all the necessary documentation. Furthermore, in application of art. 1 of the same law and which aims to prevent statelessness, in Italy the &quot;jus soli&quot; is applied in other cases: – by birth in Italy of unknown or stateless parents; – by birth on Italian territory of foreign parents unable to transmit their citizenship to the subject according to the law of the country of origin; – the child of unknown persons found in the territory of the Republic is considered a citizen by birth, if the possession of another citizenship is not proven.
* : A person born since 1 January 2020 in Latvia or to Latvian-resident parents defaults to Latvian citizenship, although the child can instead gain a different citizenship at birth if both parents agree on this; if either parent is a citizen of another country, the parents must submit documentation disclaiming any other birthright citizenship the child would otherwise be entitled to in order for the child to be recognized as a Latvian citizen by &quot;jus soli&quot;.
* : A person born in Luxembourg is automatically a Luxembourg citizen if at least one of their parents was also born in Luxembourg. Additionally, a person born in Luxembourg to foreign, non-Luxembourg-born parents can become a Luxembourg citizen from the age of 12 if they have resided uninterrupted in Luxembourg for at least 5 years immediately prior to submitting the application, and if at least one of their parents lived in Luxembourg uninterrupted for at least 12 months immediately preceding their birth. Furthermore, a person born in Luxembourg to foreign, non-Luxembourg-born parents gains Luxembourg citizenship automatically upon reaching the age of 18, provided that they have lived uninterrupted in Luxembourg for the preceding 5 years and at least one of their parents lived uninterrupted in Luxembourg for at least 12 months immediately preceding their birth.
* : A person born in Malta on or after 1 August 1989 is automatically a Maltese citizen if at least one of their parents is Maltese or was born in Malta. Anyone born in Malta before 1 August 1989, regardless of their parents&#x27; circumstances, is automatically a Maltese citizen, as the country conferred unconditional &quot;jus soli&quot; until this date (see Maltese nationality law).
* : After 31 December 1984, the following conditions apply: &quot;The child&#x27;s mother has Dutch nationality at the time of birth, or the child&#x27;s parents both have Dutch nationality at the time of birth, or the father of the child has Dutch nationality at the time of birth and is married/registered partner to the non-Dutch mother or acknowledged the child, or the child and the child&#x27;s mother have their principal residence in the Kingdom of the Netherlands at the time of birth. One of the mother&#x27;s parents also had her main residence in the Kingdom on the day the mother was born, or the child and the child&#x27;s father have their principal residence in the Kingdom of the Netherlands at the time of birth. One of the father&#x27;s parents also had his main residence in The Kingdom on the day the father was born.&quot;
* : A child born in Portuguese territory to parents who do not possess another nationality is a Portuguese citizen. Also, a person born to foreign parents who were not serving their respective states at the time of birth is a Portuguese citizen if the person declares that they want to be Portuguese and provided that one of the parents has resided in Portugal for at least one year at the time of birth.
* : A child born in Spain to foreign parents may acquire Spanish citizenship &quot;jus soli&quot; under certain conditions, for example, if either one of the parents was also born in Spain or if neither of the parents can transmit their nationality to the child (such as stateless parents).
* : A child born on the territory of Ukraine may acquire Ukrainian citizenship &quot;jus soli&quot;, if they do not acquire foreign nationality by &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; from parents, or if their parents have been granted refugee or asylum status in Ukraine, or if the child is stateless or of unknown nationality (see Ukrainian citizenship law, articles 6 and 7).
* : Prior to 1 July 2006 unmarried British fathers did not automatically pass on their nationality to children born out of wedlock, even if those children were born in the United Kingdom. &quot;Jus soli&quot; citizenship was abolished by the British Nationality Act of 1981. Since 1 January 1983 until the 2006 changes, children born out of wedlock to foreign (non-British) women were not eligible for citizenship unless the mother was legally &quot;settled&quot; in the country. In 2015 the law was applied retroactively to children born prior to 2006. Under the current law, if neither parent is British or settled, then a child born in the UK can apply for British citizenship if they have spent the first ten years of their life in the UK (see British nationality law).

=== Oceania ===
* : Since 20 August 1986, a person born in Australia acquires Australian citizenship by birth only if at least one parent was an Australian citizen or permanent resident; or else after living the first ten years of their life in Australia, regardless of their parents&#x27; citizenship status (see Australian nationality law).
* : Since 1 January 2006, a person born in New Zealand acquires New Zealand citizenship by birth only if at least one parent was a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident (includes Australian citizens and Permanent Residents) (see New Zealand nationality law), or if to prevent being stateless.
* (): People born in American Samoa do not acquire U.S. citizenship at birth, unless one of their parents is a U.S. citizen.

== Abolition ==
* India: A person who was born in India from 26 January 1950 until 1 July 1987 is a citizen by birth, regardless of the parents&#x27; nationality. It was restricted in 1987 to people with at least one parent who was a citizen. As of today, a person born in India is a citizen only if at least one parent is a citizen, and the other parent is a citizen or a legal migrant. These measures were brought in largely in reaction to illegal migration from Bangladesh.

<text>( , ), meaning &#x27;right of blood&#x27;, is a principle of nationality law by which nationality is determined or acquired by the nationality of one or both parents. Children at birth may be nationals of a particular state if either or both of their parents have nationality of that state. It may also apply to national identities of ethnic, cultural, or other origins. Citizenship can also apply to children whose parents belong to a diaspora and were not themselves citizens of the state conferring citizenship. This principle contrasts with &quot;jus soli&quot; (&#x27;right of soil&#x27;), which is solely based on the place of birth.

In the 21st century, almost all states apply some combination of &quot;jus soli&quot; and &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; in their nationality laws to varying degrees, in contrast to largely pure forms of either as used in the 19th and 20th centuries. Historically, the most common application of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; is a right of a child to their father&#x27;s nationality. Today, the majority of countries extend this right on an equal basis to the mother. Some apply this right irrespective of the place of birth, while others may limit it to those born in the state. Some countries provide that a child acquires the nationality of the mother if the father is unknown or stateless, and some irrespective of the place of birth. Some such children may acquire the nationality automatically while others may need to apply for a parent&#x27;s nationality. 

Most countries with mixed systems extend &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship on a limited basis only to children born in their sovereign territory who do not qualify for citizenship elsewhere to avoid statelessness an obligation for states party to the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

==Modern development==
Originally, the term &quot;nation&quot; was synonymous with &quot;ethnicity&quot;. However, at the end of the 19th century, the French-German debate on nationality saw the French, such as Ernest Renan, oppose the German conception, exemplified by Johann Fichte, who believed in an &#x27;objective nationality&#x27;, based on blood, race, or language. Renan&#x27;s republican conception (with perhaps the presence of a German-speaking population in Alsace-Lorraine) explain France&#x27;s early adoption of &quot;jus soli&quot;.

===Mixed standards===
Many nations have a mixture of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; and &quot;jus soli&quot;. For example, the United States grants citizenship based on &quot;jus soli&quot; to almost all people born within its borders, and also grants citizenship based on &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; to children born outside its borders to U.S. citizen parents subject to the parents meeting certain residency or physical presence criteria. The United Kingdom usually applies &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;, but also has a &quot;jus soli&quot; principle for children of foreign citizens living in the U.K. depending on the parents&#x27; nationality and legal residence status.

About 60% of all countries worldwide have a limited &quot;jus soli&quot; principle that extends citizenship to children born within their borders who do not qualify for citizenship in any other country. Countries which ratified the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness are obligated to enact laws as a solution for statelessness.

===Complications due to imposed boundaries===
Some modern European states which arose out of the dissolved Austro-Hungarian or Ottoman empires have huge numbers of ethnic populations outside of their new &#x27;national&#x27; boundaries, as do most of the former Soviet states. Such long-standing diasporas do not conform to codified 20th-century European rules of citizenship.

In many cases, &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; rights are mandated by international treaty, with citizenship definition imposed by the national and international community. In other cases, minorities are subject to legal and extra-legal persecution and choose to immigrate to their ancestral home country. States offering &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; rights to ethnic citizens and their descendants include Italy, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Lebanon, Armenia, Hungary and Romania.

==Current &quot;Jus sanguinis&quot; states==
=== Africa ===
=== North America ===
=== South America ===
=== Asia ===
=== Europe ===
==Current &quot;Leges sanguinis&quot; states==
Many countries provide citizenship on preferential terms to individuals with ethnic ties to these countries (so-called &quot;leges sanguinis&quot;).

<doc id="54041" wikidata="Q203913" url="?curid=54041" title="Talcott Parsons">
<text>Talcott Parsons (December 13, 1902 – May 8, 1979) was an American sociologist of the classical tradition, best known for his social action theory and structural functionalism. Parsons is considered one of the most influential figures in sociology in the 20th century. After earning a PhD in economics, he served on the faculty at Harvard University from 1927 to 1973. In 1930, he was among the first professors in its new sociology department. Later, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Department of Social Relations at Harvard.

Based on empirical data, Parsons&#x27; social action theory was the first broad, systematic, and generalizable theory of social systems developed in the United States and Europe. Some of Parsons&#x27; largest contributions to sociology in the English-speaking world were his translations of Max Weber&#x27;s work and his analyses of works by Weber, Émile Durkheim, and Vilfredo Pareto. Their work heavily influenced Parsons&#x27; view and was the foundation for his social action theory. Parsons viewed voluntaristic action through the lens of the cultural values and social structures that constrain choices and ultimately determine all social actions, as opposed to actions that are determined based on internal psychological processes. Although Parsons is generally considered a structural functionalist, towards the end of his career, in 1975, he published an article that stated that &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;structural functionalist&quot; were inappropriate ways to describe the character of his theory.

From the 1970s on, a new generation of sociologists criticized Parsons&#x27; theories as socially conservative and his writings as unnecessarily complex. Sociology courses have placed less emphasis on his theories than at the peak of his popularity (from the 1940s to the 1970s). However, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in his ideas.

Parsons was a strong advocate for the professionalization of sociology and its expansion in American academia. He was elected president of the American Sociological Association in 1949 and served as its secretary from 1960 to 1965.

== Early life ==
Parsons was born on December 13, 1902, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Edward Smith Parsons and Mary Augusta Ingersoll. His father had attended Yale Divinity School, was ordained as a Congregationalist minister, and served first as a minister for a pioneer community in Greeley, Colorado. At the time of Parsons&#x27; birth, his father was a professor in English and vice-president at Colorado College. During his Congregational ministry in Greeley, Edward had become sympathetic to the Social Gospel movement but tended to view it from a higher theological position and was hostile to the ideology of socialism.

== Education ==
===Amherst College===
As an undergraduate, Parsons studied biology and philosophy at Amherst College and received his BA in 1924. Amherst College had become the Parsons&#x27; family college by tradition; his father and his uncle Frank had attended it, as had his elder brother, Charles Edward. Initially, Parsons was attracted to a career in medicine, as he was inspired by his elder brother so he studied a great deal of biology and spent a summer working at the Oceanographic Institution at Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

Parsons&#x27; biology professors at Amherst were Otto C. Glaser and Henry Plough. Gently mocked as &quot;Little Talcott, the gilded cherub,&quot; Parsons became one of the student leaders at Amherst. Parsons also took courses with Walton Hale Hamilton and the philosopher Clarence Edwin Ayres, both known as &quot;institutional economists&quot;. Hamilton, in particular, drew Parsons toward social science. They exposed him to literature by authors such as Thorstein Veblen, John Dewey, and William Graham Sumner. Parsons also took a course with George Brown in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and a course in modern German philosophy with Otto Manthey-Zorn, who was a great interpreter of Kant. Parsons showed from early on, a great interest in the topic of philosophy.

Two term papers that Parsons wrote as a student for Clarence E. Ayres at Amherst have survived. They are referred to as the Amherst Papers and have been of strong interest to Parsons scholars. The first was written on December 19, 1922, &quot;The Theory of Human Behavior in its Individual and Social Aspects.&quot; The second was written on March 27, 1923, &quot;A Behavioristic Conception of the Nature of Morals&quot;. The papers reveal Parsons&#x27; early interest in social evolution. The Amherst Papers also reveal that Parsons did not agree with his professors since he wrote in his Amherst papers that technological development and moral progress are two structurally-independent empirical processes.

===London School of Economics===
After Amherst, he studied at the London School of Economics for a year, where he was exposed to the work of Bronisław Malinowski, R. H. Tawney, L. T. Hobhouse, and Harold Laski. During his days at LSE, he made friends with E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Meyer Fortes, and Raymond Firth, who all participated in the Malinowski seminar. Also, he made a close personal friendship with Arthur and Eveline M. Burns.

At LSE he met Helen Bancroft Walker, a young American, and they married on April 30, 1927. The couple had three children: Anne, Charles, and Susan.

===University of Heidelberg===
In June, Parsons went on to the University of Heidelberg, where he received his PhD in sociology and economics in 1927. At Heidelberg, he worked with Alfred Weber, Max Weber&#x27;s brother; Edgar Salin, his dissertation adviser; Emil Lederer; and Karl Mannheim. He was examined on Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; by the philosopher Karl Jaspers. At Heidelberg, Parsons was also examined by Willy Andreas on the French Revolution. Parsons wrote his Dr. Phil. thesis on &quot;The Concept of Capitalism in the Recent German Literature&quot;, with his main focus on the work of Werner Sombart and Weber. It was clear from his discussion that he rejected Sombart&#x27;s quasi-idealistic views and supported Weber&#x27;s attempt to strike a balance between historicism, idealism and neo-Kantianism.

The most crucial encounter for Parsons at Heidelberg was with the work of Max Weber about whom he had never heard before. Weber became tremendously important for Parsons because his upbringing with a liberal but strongly-religious father had made the question of the role of culture and religion in the basic processes of world history a persistent puzzle in his mind. Weber was the first scholar who truly provided Parsons with a compelling theoretical &quot;answer&quot; to the question.

Parsons decided to translate Weber&#x27;s work into English and approached Marianne Weber, Weber&#x27;s widow. Parsons would eventually translate several of Weber&#x27;s works. His time in Heidelberg had him invited by Marianne Weber to &quot;sociological teas&quot;, which were study group meetings that she held in the library room of her and Max&#x27;s old apartment. One scholar that Parsons met at Heidelberg who shared his enthusiasm for Weber was Alexander von Schelting. Parsons later wrote a review article on von Schelting&#x27;s book on Weber. Generally, Parsons read extensively in religious literature, especially works focusing on the sociology of religion. One scholar who became especially important for Parsons was Ernst D. Troeltsch. Parsons also read widely on Calvinism. His reading included the work of Emile Doumerque, Eugéne Choisy, and Henri Hauser.

==Early academic career==
===Harvard===
In 1927, after a year of teaching at Amherst (1926–1927), Parsons entered Harvard, as an instructor in the Economics Department, where he followed F. W. Taussig&#x27;s lectures on economist Alfred Marshall and became friends with the economist historian Edwin Gay, the founder of Harvard Business School. Parsons also became a close associate of Joseph Schumpeter and followed his course General Economics. Parsons was at odds with some of the trends in Harvard&#x27;s department which then went in a highly-technical and a mathematical direction. He looked for other options at Harvard and gave courses in &quot;Social Ethics&quot; and in the &quot;Sociology of Religion&quot;.

The chance for a shift to sociology came in 1930, when Harvard&#x27;s Sociology Department was created under Russian scholar Pitirim Sorokin. Parsons became one of the new department&#x27;s two instructors, along with Carle Zimmerman. Parsons established close ties with biochemist and sociologist Lawrence Joseph Henderson, who took a personal interest in Parsons&#x27; career at Harvard. Parsons became part of L. J. Henderson&#x27;s famous Pareto study group, in which some of the most important intellectuals at Harvard participated, including Crane Brinton, George C. Homans, and Charles P. Curtis. Parsons wrote an article on Pareto&#x27;s theory and later explained that he had adopted the concept of &quot;social system&quot; from reading Pareto. Parsons also made strong connections with two other influential intellectuals with whom he corresponded for years: economist Frank H. Knight and businessman Chester Barnard. The relationship between Parsons and Sorokin turned sour. A pattern of personal tensions was aggravated by Sorokin&#x27;s deep dislike for American civilization, which he regarded as a sensate culture that was in decline. Sorokin&#x27;s writings became increasingly anti-scientistic in his later years, widening the gulf between his work and Parsons&#x27; and turning the increasingly positivistic American sociology community against him. Sorokin also tended to belittle all sociology tendencies that differed from his own writings, and by 1934 was quite unpopular at Harvard.

Some of Parsons&#x27; students in the department of sociology were Robin Williams Jr., Robert K. Merton, Kingsley Davis, Wilbert Moore, Edward C. Devereux, Logan Wilson, Nicholas Demereth, John Riley Jr., and Mathilda White Riley. Later cohorts of students included Harry Johnson, Bernard Barber, Marion Levy and Jesse R. Pitts. Parsons established, at the students&#x27; request, an informal study group which met year after year in Adams&#x27; house. Toward the end of Parsons&#x27; career, German systems theorist Niklas Luhmann also attended his lectures.

In 1932, Parsons bought a farmhouse near the small town of Acworth, but Parsons often, in his writing, referred to it as &quot;the farmhouse in Alstead&quot;. The farmhouse was a very humble structure with almost no modern utilities. Still, it became central to Parsons&#x27; life, and many of his most important works were written there.

In the academic year of 1939–1940 Parsons and Schumpeter conducted an informal faculty seminar at Harvard, which discussed the concept of rationality. Among the participants were D. V. McGranahan, Abram Bergson, Wassily Leontief, Gottfried Haberler, and Paul Sweezy. Schumpeter contributed the essay &quot;Rationality in Economics&quot;, and Parsons submitted the paper &quot;The Role of Rationality in Social Action&quot; for a general discussion.

===Neoclassical economics vs. institutionalists===
In the discussion between neoclassical economics and the institutionalists, which was one of the conflicts that prevailed within the field of economics in the 1920s and early 1930s, Parsons attempted to walk a very fine line. He was very critical about neoclassical theory, an attitude he maintained throughout his life and that is reflected in his critique of Milton Friedman and Gary Becker. He was opposed to the utilitarian bias within the neoclassical approach and could not embrace them fully. However, he agreed partly on their theoretical and methodological style of approach, which should be distinguished from its substance. He was thus unable to accept the institutionalist solution. In a 1975 interview, Parsons recalled a conversation with Schumpeter on the institutionalist methodological position: An economist like Schumpeter, by contrast, would absolutely have none of that. I remember talking to him about the problem and .. I think Schumpeter was right. If economics had gone that way [like the institutionalists] it would have had to become a primarily empirical discipline, largely descriptive, and without theoretical focus. That&#x27;s the way the &#x27;institutionalists&#x27; went, and of course Mitchell was affiliated with that movement.

===Anti-Nazism===
Parsons returned to Germany in the summer of 1930 and became an eyewitness to the feverish atmosphere in Weimar Germany during which the Nazi Party rose to power. Parsons received constant reports about the rise of Nazism through his friend, Edward Y. Hartshorne, who was traveling there. Parsons began, in the late 1930s, to warn the American public about the Nazi threat, but he had little success, as a poll showed that 91 percent of the country opposed the Second World War.
One of the first articles that Parsons wrote was &quot;New Dark Age Seen If Nazis Should Win&quot;. He was one of the key initiators of the Harvard Defense Committee, aimed at rallying the American public against the Nazis. Parsons&#x27; voice sounded again and again over Boston&#x27;s local radio stations, and he also spoke against Nazism during a dramatic meeting at Harvard, which was disturbed by antiwar activists. Together with graduate student Charles O. Porter, Parsons rallied graduate students at Harvard for the war effort. During the war, Parsons conducted a special study group at Harvard, which analyzed what its members considered the causes of Nazism, and leading experts on that topic participated.

==Second World War==
In the spring of 1941, a discussion group on Japan began to meet at Harvard. The group&#x27;s five core members were Parsons, John K. Fairbank, Edwin O. Reischauer, William M. McGovern, and Marion Levy Jr. A few others occasionally joined the group, including Ai-Li Sung and Edward Y. Hartshorne. The group arose out of a strong desire to understand the country, but, as Levy frankly admitted, &quot;Reischauer was the only one who knew anything about Japan.&quot; Parsons, however, was eager to learn more about it and was &quot;concerned with general implications.&quot;

In 1942, Parsons worked on arranging a major study of occupied countries with Bartholomew Landheer of the Netherlands Information Office in New York. Parsons had mobilized Georges Gurvitch, Conrad Arnsberg, Dr. Safranek and Theodore Abel to participate, but it never materialized for lack of funding. In early 1942, Parsons unsuccessfully approached Hartshorne, who had joined the Psychology Division of the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI) in Washington to interest his agency in the research project. In February 1943, Parsons became the deputy director of the Harvard School of Overseas Administration, which educated administrators to &quot;run&quot; the occupied territories in Germany and the Pacific Ocean. The task of finding relevant literature on both Europe and Asia was mindboggling and occupied a fair amount of Parsons&#x27; time. One scholar Parsons came to know was Karl August Wittfogel and they discussed Weber. On China, Parsons received fundamental information from Chinese scholar Ai-Li Sung Chin and her husband, Robert Chin. Another Chinese scholar Parsons worked closely with in this period was Hsiao-Tung Fei (or Fei Xiaotong), who had studied at the London School of Economics and was an expert on the social structure of the Chinese village.

===Intellectual exchanges===
Parsons met Alfred Schütz during the rationality seminar, which he conducted together with Schumpeter, at Harvard in the spring of 1940. Schütz had been close to Edmund Husserl and was deeply embedded in the latter&#x27;s phenomenological philosophy. Schütz was born in Vienna but moved to the US in 1939, and for years, he worked on the project of developing a phenomenological sociology, primarily based on an attempt to find some point between Husserl&#x27;s method and Weber&#x27;s sociology. Parsons had asked Schütz to give a presentation at the rationality seminar, which he did on April 13, 1940, and Parsons and Schütz had lunch together afterward. Schütz was fascinated with Parsons&#x27; theory, which he regarded as the state-of-the-art social theory, and wrote an evaluation of Parsons&#x27; theory that he kindly asked Parsons to comment. That led to a short but intensive correspondence, which generally revealed that the gap between Schütz&#x27;s sociologized phenomenology and Parsons&#x27; concept of voluntaristic action was far too great. From Parsons&#x27; point of view, Schütz&#x27;s position was too speculative and subjectivist, and tended to reduce social processes to the articulation of a &quot;Lebenswelt&quot; consciousness. For Parsons, the defining edge of human life was action as a catalyst for historical change, and it was essential for sociology, as a science, to pay strong attention to the subjective element of action, but it should never become completely absorbed in it since the purpose of a science was to explain causal relationships, by covering laws or by other types of explanatory devices. Schütz&#x27;s basic argument was that sociology cannot ground itself and that epistemology was not a luxury but a necessity for the social scientist. Parsons agreed but stressed the pragmatic need to demarcate science and philosophy and insisted moreover that the grounding of a conceptual scheme for empirical theory construction cannot aim at absolute solutions but needs to take a sensible stock-taking of the epistemological balance at each point in time. However, the two men shared many basic assumptions about the nature of social theory, which has kept the debate simmering ever since. By request from Ilse Schütz, after her husband&#x27;s death, Parsons gave permission to publish the correspondence between him and Schütz. Parsons also wrote &quot;A 1974 Retrospective Perspective&quot; to the correspondence, which characterized his position as a &quot;Kantian point of view&quot; and found that Schütz&#x27;s strong dependence on Husserl&#x27;s &quot;phenomenological reduction&quot; would make it very difficult to reach the kind of &quot;conceptual scheme&quot; that Parsons found essential for theory-building in social sciences.

Between 1940 and 1944, Parsons and Eric Voegelin exchanged intellectual views through correspondence. Parsons had probably met Voegelin in 1938 and 1939, when Voegelin held a temporary instructor appointment at Harvard. The bouncing point for their conversation was Parsons&#x27; manuscript on anti-Semitism and other materials that he had sent to Voegelin. Discussion touched on the nature of capitalism, the rise of the West, and the origin of Nazism. The key to the discussion was the implication of Weber&#x27;s interpretation of Protestant ethics and the impact of Calvinism on modern history. Although the two scholars agreed on many fundamental characteristics about Calvinism, their understanding of its historical impact was quite different. Generally, Voegelin regarded Calvinism as essentially a dangerous totalitarian ideology; Parsons argued that its current features were temporary and that the functional implications of its long-term, emerging value-l system had revolutionary and not only &quot;negative&quot; impact on the general rise of the institutions of modernity.

The two scholars also discussed Parsons&#x27; debate with Schütz and especially why Parsons had ended his encounter with Schutz. Parsons found that Schutz, rather than attempting to build social science theory, tended to get consumed in philosophical detours. Parsons wrote to Voegelin: &quot;Possibly one of my troubles in my discussion with Schuetz lies in the fact that by cultural heritage I am a Calvinist. I do not want to be a philosopher – I shy away from the philosophical problems underlying my scientific work. By the same token I don&#x27;t think he wants to be a scientist as I understand the term until he has settled all the underlying philosophical difficulties. If the physicists of the 17th century had been Schuetzes there might well have been no Newtonian system.&quot;

In 1942, Stuart C. Dodd published a major work, &quot;Dimensions of Society&quot;, which attempted to build a general theory of society on the foundation of a mathematical and quantitative systematization of social sciences. Dodd advanced a particular approach, known as an &quot;S-theory&quot;. Parsons discussed Dodd&#x27;s theoretical outline in a review article the same year. Parsons acknowledged Dodd&#x27;s contribution to be an exceedingly formidable work but argued against its premises as a general paradigm for the social sciences. Parsons generally argued that Dodd&#x27;s &quot;S-theory&quot;, which included the so-called &quot;social distance&quot; scheme of Bogardus, was unable to construct a sufficiently sensitive and systematized theoretical matrix, compared with the &quot;traditional&quot; approach, which has developed around the lines of Weber, Pareto, Émile Durkheim, Sigmund Freud, William Isaac Thomas, and other important agents of an action-system approach with a clearer dialogue with the cultural and motivational dimensions of human interaction.

In April 1944, Parsons participated in a conference, &quot;On Germany after the War&quot;, of psychoanalytical oriented psychiatrists and a few social scientists to analyze the causes of Nazism and to discuss the principles for the coming occupation.

During the conference, Parsons opposed what he found to be Lawrence S. Kubie&#x27;s reductionism. Kubie was a psychoanalyst, who strongly argued that the German national character was completely &quot;destructive&quot; and that it would be necessary for a special agency of the United Nations to control the German educational system directly. Parsons and many others at the conference were strongly opposed to Kubie&#x27;s idea. Parsons argued that it would fail and suggested that Kubie was viewing the question of Germans&#x27; reorientation &quot;too exclusively in psychiatric terms&quot;. Parsons was also against the extremely harsh Morgenthau Plan, published in September 1944. After the conference, Parsons wrote an article, &quot;The Problem of Controlled Institutional Change&quot;, against the plan.

Parsons participated as a part-time adviser to the Foreign Economic Administration Agency between March and October 1945 to discuss postwar reparations and deindustrialization.

Parsons was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1945.

===Taking charge at Harvard===
Parsons&#x27; situation at Harvard University changed significantly in early 1944, when he received a good offer from Northwestern University. Harvard reacted to the offer by appointing Parsons as the chairman of the department, promoting him to the rank of full professor and accepting the process of reorganization, which led to the establishment of the new department of Social Relations. Parsons&#x27; letter to Dean Paul Buck, on April 3, 1944, reveals the high point of this moment. Because of the new development at Harvard, Parsons chose to decline an offer from William Langer to join the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency. Langer proposed for Parsons to follow the American army in its march into Germany and to function as a political adviser to the administration of the occupied territories. Late in 1944, under the auspices of the Cambridge Community Council, Parsons directed a project together with Elizabeth Schlesinger. They investigated ethnic and racial tensions in the Boston area between students from Radcliffe College and Wellesley College. This study was a reaction to an upsurge of anti-Semitism in the Boston area, which began in late 1943 and continued into 1944. At the end of November 1946, the Social Research Council (SSRC) asked Parsons to write a comprehensive report of the topic of how the social sciences could contribute to the understanding of the modern world. The background was a controversy over whether the social sciences should be incorporated into the National Science Foundation.

Parsons&#x27; report was in form of a large memorandum, &quot;Social Science: A Basic National Resource&quot;, which became publicly available in July 1948 and remains a powerful historical statement about how he saw the role of modern social sciences.

==Postwar==
===Russian Research Center===
Parsons became a member of the executive committee of the new Russian Research Center at Harvard in 1948, which had Parsons&#x27; close friend and colleague, Clyde Kluckhohn, as its director. Parsons went to Allied-occupied Germany in the summer of 1948, was a contact person for the RRC, and was interested in the Russian refugees who were stranded in Germany. He happened to interview in Germany a few members of the Vlasov Army, a Russian Liberation Army that had collaborated with the Germans during the war. The movement was named after Andrey Vlasov, a Soviet general captured by the Germans in June 1942. The Vlasov movement&#x27;s ideology was a hybrid of elements and has been called &quot;communism without Stalin&quot;, but in the Prague Manifesto (1944), it had moved toward the framework of a constitutional liberal state.

In Germany in the summer of 1948 Parsons wrote several letters to Kluckhohn to report on his investigations.

===Anticommunism===
Parsons&#x27; fight against communism was a natural extension of his fight against fascism in the 1930s and the 1940s. For Parsons, communism and fascism were two aspects of the same problem; his article &quot;A Tentative Outline of American Values&quot;, published posthumously in 1989, called both collectivistic types &quot;empirical finalism&quot;, which he believed was a secular &quot;mirror&quot; of religious types of &quot;salvationalism&quot;. In contrast, Parsons highlighted that American values generally were based on the principle of &quot;instrumental activism&quot;, which he believed was the outcome of Puritanism as a historical process. It represented what Parsons called &quot;worldly asceticism&quot; and represented the absolute opposite of empirical finalism. One can thus understand Parsons&#x27; statement late in life that the greatest threat to humanity is every type of &quot;fundamentalism&quot;. By the term &quot;empirical finalism&quot;, he implied the type of claim assessed by cultural and ideological actors about the correct or &quot;final&quot; ends of particular patterns of value orientation in the actual historical world (such as the notion of &quot;a truly just society&quot;), which was absolutist and &quot;indisputable&quot; in its manner of declaration and in its function as a belief system. A typical example would be the Jacobins&#x27; behavior during the French Revolution. Parsons&#x27; rejection of communist and fascist totalitarianism was theoretically and intellectually an integral part of his theory of world history, and he tended to regard the European Reformation as the most crucial event in &quot;modern&quot; world history. Like Weber, he tended to highlight the crucial impact of Calvinist religiosity in the socio-political and socio-economic processes that followed. He maintained it reached its most radical form in England in the 17th century and in effect gave birth to the special cultural mode that has characterized the American value system and history ever since. The Calvinist faith system, authoritarian in the beginning, eventually released in its accidental long-term institutional effects a fundamental democratic revolution in the world. Parsons maintained that the revolution was steadily unfolding, as part of an interpenetration of Puritan values in the world at large.

===American exceptionalism===
Parsons defended American exceptionalism and argued that, because of a variety of historical circumstances, the impact of the Reformation had reached a certain intensity in British history. Puritan, essentially Calvinist, value patterns had become institutionalized in Britain&#x27;s internal situation. The outcome was that Puritan radicalism was reflected in the religious radicalism of the Puritan sects, in the poetry of John Milton, in the English Civil War, and in the process leading to the Glorious Revolution of 1688. It was the radical fling of the Puritan Revolution that provided settlers in early 17th-century Colonial America, and the Puritans who settled in America represented radical views on individuality, egalitarianism, skepticism toward state power, and the zeal of the religious calling. The settlers established something unique in the world that was under the religious zeal of Calvinist values.

Therefore, a new kind of nation was born, the character of which became clear by the time of the American Revolution and in the US constitution, and its dynamics were later studied by Alexis de Tocqueville. The French Revolution was a failed attempt to copy the American model. Although America has changed in its social composition since 1787, Parsons maintained that it preserves the basic revolutionary Calvinist value pattern. That has been further revealed in the pluralist and highly individualized America, with its thick, network-oriented civil society, which is of crucial importance to its success and these factors have provided it with its historical lead in the process of industrialization.

Parsons maintained that this has continued to place it in the leading position in the world, but as a historical process and not in &quot;the nature of things&quot;. Parsons viewed the &quot;highly special feature of the modern Western social world&quot; as &quot;dependent on the peculiar circumstances of its history, and not the necessary universal result of social development as a whole&quot;.

===Defender of modernity===
In contrast to some &quot;radicals&quot;, Parsons was a defender of modernity. He believed that modern civilization, with its technology and its constantly evolving institutions, was ultimately strong, vibrant, and essentially progressive. He acknowledged that the future had no inherent guarantees, but as sociologists Robert Holton and Bryan Turner said that Parsons was not nostalgic and that he did not believe in the past as a lost &quot;golden age&quot; but that he maintained that modernity generally had improved conditions, admittedly often in troublesome and painful ways but usually positively. He had faith in humanity&#x27;s potential but not naïvely. When asked at the Brown Seminary in 1973 if he was optimistic about the future, he answered, &quot;Oh, I think I&#x27;m basically optimistic about the human prospects in the long run.&quot; Parsons pointed out that he had been a student at Heidelberg at the height of the vogue of Oswald Spengler, author of &quot;The Decline of the West&quot;, &quot;and he didn&#x27;t give the West more than 50 years of continuing vitality after the time he wrote... Well, its more than 50 years later now, and I don&#x27;t think the West has just simply declined. He was wrong in thinking it was the end.&quot;

===Harvard Department of Social Relations===
At Harvard, Parsons was instrumental in forming the Department of Social Relations, an interdisciplinary venture among sociology, anthropology, and psychology. The new department was officially created in January 1946 with him as the chairman and with prominent figures at the faculty, such as Stouffer, Kluckhohn, Henry Murray and Gordon Allport. An appointment for Hartshorne was considered but he was killed in Germany by an unknown gunman as he was driving on the highway. His position went instead to George C. Homans. The new department was galvanized by Parsons&#x27; idea of creating a theoretical and institutional base for a unified social science. Parsons also became strongly interested in systems theory and cybernetics and began to adopt their basic ideas and concepts to the realm of social science, giving special attention to the work of Norbert Wiener.

Some of the students who arrived at the Department of Social Relations in the years after the Second World War were David Aberle, Gardner Lindzey, Harold Garfinkel, David G. Hays, Benton Johnson, Marian Johnson, Kaspar Naegele, James Olds, Albert Cohen, Norman Birnbaum, Robin Murphy Williams, Jackson Toby, Robert N. Bellah, Joseph Kahl, Joseph Berger, Morris Zelditch, Renée Fox, Tom O&#x27;Dea, Ezra Vogel, Clifford Geertz, Joseph Elder, Theodore Mills, Mark Field, Edward Laumann, and Francis Sutton.

Renée Fox, who arrived at Harvard in 1949, would become a very close friend of the Parsons family. Joseph Berger, who also arrived at Harvard in 1949 after finishing his BA from Brooklyn College, would become Parsons&#x27; research assistant from 1952 to 1953 and would get involved in his research projects with Robert F. Bales.

According to Parsons&#x27; own account, it was during his conversations with Elton Mayo that he realized it was necessary for him to take a serious look at the work of Freud. In the fall of 1938, Parsons began to offer a series of non-credit evening courses on Freud. As time passed, Parsons developed a strong interest in psychoanalysis. He volunteered to participate in nontherapeutic training at the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute, where he began a didactic analysis with Grete Bibring in September 1946. Insight into psychoanalysis is significantly reflected in his later work, especially reflected in &quot;The Social System&quot; and his general writing on psychological issues and on the theory of socialization. That influence was also to some extent apparent in his empirical analysis of fascism during the war. Wolfgang Köhler&#x27;s study of the mentality of apes and Kurt Koffka&#x27;s ideas of Gestalt psychology also received Parsons&#x27; attention.

===&quot;The Social System&quot; and &quot;Toward a General Theory of Action&quot;===
During the late 1940s and the early 1950s, he worked very hard on producing some major theoretical statements. In 1951, Parsons published two major theoretical works, &quot;The Social System&quot; and &quot;Toward a General Theory of Action&quot;. The latter work, which was coauthored with Edward Tolman, Edward Shils and several others, was the outcome of the so-called Carnegie Seminar at Harvard University, which had taken place in the period of September 1949 and January 1950. The former work was Parsons&#x27; first major attempt to present his basic outline of a general theory of society since &quot;The Structure of Social Action&quot; (1937). He discusses the basic methodological and metatheoretical principles for such a theory. He attempts to present a general social system theory that is built systematically from most basic premises and so he featured the idea of an interaction situation based on need-dispositions and facilitated through the basic concepts of cognitive, cathectic, and evaluative orientation. The work also became known for introducing his famous pattern variables, which in reality represented choices distributed along a &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; vs. &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; axis.

The details of Parsons&#x27; thought about the outline of the social system went through a rapid series of changes in the following years, but the basics remained. During the early 1950s, the idea of the AGIL model took place in Parsons&#x27;s mind gradually. According to Parsons, its key idea was sparked during his work with Bales on motivational processes in small groups.

Parsons carried the idea into the major work that he co-authored with a student, Neil Smelser, which was published in 1956 as &quot;Economy and Society&quot;. 
Within this work, the first rudimentary model of the AGIL scheme was presented. It reorganized the basic concepts of the pattern variables in a new way and presented the solution within a system-theoretical approach by using the idea of a cybernetic hierarchy as an organizing principle. The real innovation in the model was the concept of the &quot;latent function&quot; or the pattern maintenance function, which became the crucial key to the whole cybernetic hierarchy.

During its theoretical development, Parsons showed a persistent interest in symbolism. An important statement is Parsons&#x27; &quot;The Theory of Symbolism in Relation to Action&quot;. The article was stimulated by a series of informal discussion group meetings, which Parsons and several other colleagues in the spring of 1951 had conducted with philosopher and semiotician Charles W. Morris. His interest in symbolism went hand in hand with his interest in Freud&#x27;s theory and &quot;The Superego and the Theory of Social Systems&quot;, written in May 1951 for a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. The paper can be regarded as the main statement of his own interpretation of Freud, but also as a statement of how Parsons tried to use Freud&#x27;s pattern of symbolization to structure the theory of social system and eventually to codify the cybernetic hierarchy of the AGIL system within the parameter of a system of symbolic differentiation. His discussion of Freud also contains several layers of criticism that reveal that Parsons&#x27; use of Freud was selective rather than orthodox. In particular, he claimed that Freud had &quot;introduced an unreal separation between the superego and the ego&quot;.

===Subscriber to systems theory===
Parsons was an early subscriber to systems theory. He had early been fascinated by the writings of Walter B. Cannon and his concept of homeostasis as well as the writings of French physiologist Claude Bernard. His interest in systems theory had been further stimulated by his contract with L.J. Henderson. Parsons called the concept of &quot;system&quot; for an indispensable master concept in the work of building theoretical paradigms for social sciences. From 1952 to 1957, Parsons participated in an ongoing Conference on System Theory under the chairmanship of Roy R. Grinker, Sr., in Chicago.

Parsons came into contact with several prominent intellectuals of the time and was particularly impressed by the ideas of social insect biologist Alfred Emerson. Parsons was especially compelled by Emerson&#x27;s idea that, in the sociocultural world, the functional equivalent of the gene was that of the &quot;symbol&quot;. Parsons also participated in two of the meetings of the famous Macy Conferences on systems theory and on issues that are now classified as cognitive science, which took place in New York from 1946 to 1953 and included scientists like John von Neumann. Parsons read widely on systems theory at the time, especially works of Norbert Wiener and William Ross Ashby, who were also among the core participants in the conferences. Around the same time, Parsons also benefited from conversations with political scientist Karl Deutsch on systems theory. In one conference, the Fourth Conference of the problems of consciousness in March 1953 at Princeton and sponsored by the Macy Foundation, Parsons would give a presentation on &quot;Conscious and Symbolic Processes&quot; and embark on an intensive group discussion which included exchange with child psychologist Jean Piaget.

Among the other participants were Mary A.B. Brazier, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, Nathaniel Kleitman, Margaret Mead and Gregory Zilboorg. Parsons would defend the thesis that consciousness is essentially a social action phenomenon, not primarily a &quot;biological&quot; one. During the conference, Parsons criticized Piaget for not sufficiently separating cultural factors from a physiologistic concept of &quot;energy&quot;.

===McCarthy era===
During the McCarthy era, on April 1, 1952, J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, received a personal letter from an informant who reported on communist activities at Harvard. During a later interview, the informant claimed that &quot;Parsons... was probably the leader of an inner group&quot; of communist sympathizers at Harvard. The informant reported that the old department under Sorokin had been conservative and had &quot;loyal Americans of good character&quot; but that the new Department of Social Relations had turned into a decisive left-wing place as a result of &quot;Parsons&#x27;s manipulations and machinations&quot;. On October 27, 1952, Hoover authorized the Boston FBI to initiate a security-type investigation on Parsons. In February 1954, a colleague, Stouffer, wrote to Parsons in England to inform him that Stouffer had been denied access to classified documents and that part of the stated reason was that Stouffer knew communists, including Parsons, &quot;who was a member of the Communist Party&quot;.

Parsons immediately wrote an affidavit in defense of Stouffer, and he also defended himself against the charges that were in the affidavit: &quot;This allegation is so preposterous that I cannot understand how any reasonable person could come to the conclusion that I was a member of the Communist Party or ever had been.&quot; In a personal letter to Stouffer, Parsons wrote, &quot;I will fight for you against this evil with everything there is in me: I am in it with you to the death.&quot; The charges against Parsons resulted in Parsons being unable to participate in a UNESCO conference, and it was not until January 1955 that he was acquitted of the charges.

===&quot;Family, Socialization and Interaction Process&quot;===
Since the late 1930s, Parsons had continued to show great interest in psychology and in psychoanalysis. In the academic year of 1955–1956, he taught a seminar at Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute entitled &quot;Sociology and Psychoanalysis&quot;. In 1956, he published a major work, &quot;Family, Socialization and Interaction Process&quot;, which explored the way in which psychology and psychoanalysis bounce into the theories of motivation and socialization, as well into the question of kinship, which for Parsons established the fundamental axis for that subsystem he later would call &quot;the social community&quot;.

It contained articles written by Parsons and articles written in collaboration with Robert F. Bales, James Olds, Morris Zelditch Jr., and Philip E. Slater. The work included a theory of personality as well as studies of role differentiation. The strongest intellectual stimulus that Parsons most likely got then was from brain researcher James Olds, one of the founders of neuroscience and whose 1955 book on learning and motivation was strongly influenced from his conversations with Parsons. Some of the ideas in the book had been submitted by Parsons in an intellectual brainstorm in an informal &quot;work group&quot; which he had organized with Joseph Berger, William Caudill, Frank E. Jones, Kaspar D. Naegele, Theodore M. Mills, Bengt G. Rundblad, and others. Albert J. Reiss from Vanderbilt University had submitted his critical commentary.

In the mid-1950s, Parsons also had extensive discussions with Olds about the motivational structure of psychosomatic problems, and at this time Parsons&#x27; concept of psychosomatic problems was strongly influenced by readings and direct conversations with Franz Alexander (a psychoanalyst, originally associated with the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute, who was a pioneer of psychosomatic medicine), Grinker and John Spiegel.

In 1955, François Bourricaud was preparing a reader of some of Parsons&#x27; work for a French audience, and Parsons wrote a preface for the book &quot;Au lecteur français&quot; (&quot;To the French Reader&quot;); it also went over Bourricaud&#x27;s introduction very carefully. In his correspondence with Bourricaud, Parsons insisted that he did not necessarily treat values as the only, let alone &quot;the primary empirical reference point&quot; of the action system since so many other factors were also involved in the actual historical pattern of an action situation.

===Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences===
Parsons spent 1957 to 1958 at the Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto, California, where he met for the first time Kenneth Burke; Burke&#x27;s flamboyant, explosive temperament made a great impression on Parsons, and the two men became close friends. Parsons explained in a letter the impression Burke had left on him: &quot;The big thing to me is that Burke more than anyone else has helped me to fill a major gap in my own theoretical interests, in the field of the analysis of expressive symbolism.&quot;

Another scholar whom Parsons met at the Center of Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences at Palo Alto was Alfred L. Kroeber, the &quot;dean of American anthropologists&quot;. Kroeber, who had received his PhD at Columbia and who had worked with the Arapaho Indians, was about 81 when Parsons met him. Parsons had the greatest admiration for Kroeber and called him &quot;my favorite elder statesman&quot;.

In Palo Alto, Kroeber suggested to Parsons that they write a joint statement to clarify the distinction between cultural and social systems, then the subject of endless debates. In October 1958, Parsons and Kroeber published their joint statement in a short article, &quot;The Concept of Culture and the Social System&quot;, which became highly influential. Parsons and Kroeber declared that it is important both to keep a clear distinction between the two concepts and to avoid a methodology by which either would be reduced to the other.

==Later career==
===Public conferences===
In 1955 to 1956, a group of faculty members at Cornell University met regularly and discussed Parsons&#x27; writings. The next academic year, a series of seven widely attended public seminars followed and culminated in a session at which he answered his critics. The discussions in the seminars were summed up in a book edited by Max Black, &quot;The Social Theories of Talcott Parsons: A Critical Examination&quot;. It included an essay by Parsons, &quot;The Point of View of the Author&quot;. The scholars included in the volume were Edward C. Devereux Jr., Robin M. Williams Jr., Chandler Morse, Alfred L. Baldwin, Urie Bronfenbrenner, Henry A. Landsberger, William Foote Whyte, Black, and Andrew Hacker. The contributions converted many angles including personality theory, organizational theory, and various methodological discussions. Parsons&#x27; essay is particularly notable because it and another essay, &quot;Pattern Variables Revisited&quot;, both represented the most full-scale accounts of the basic elements of his theoretical strategy and the general principles behind his approach to theory-building when they were published in 1960.

One essay also included, in metatheoretical terms, a criticism of the theoretical foundations for so-called conflict theory.

===Criticism of theories===
From the late 1950s to the student rebellion in the 1960s and its aftermath, Parsons&#x27; theory was criticized by some scholars and intellectuals of the left, who claimed that Parsons&#x27;s theory was inherently conservative, if not reactionary. Alvin Gouldner even claimed that Parsons had been an opponent of the New Deal. Parsons&#x27; theory was further regarded as unable to reflect social change, human suffering, poverty, deprivation, and conflict. Theda Skocpol thought that the apartheid system in South Africa was the ultimate proof that Parsons&#x27;s theory was &quot;wrong&quot;.

At the same time, Parsons&#x27; idea of the individual was seen as &quot;oversocialized&quot;, &quot;repressive&quot;, or subjugated in normative &quot;conformity&quot;. In addition, Jürgen Habermas and countless others were of the belief that Parsons&#x27; system theory and his action theory were inherently opposed and mutually hostile and that his system theory was especially &quot;mechanical&quot;, &quot;positivistic&quot;, &quot;anti-individualistic&quot;, &quot;anti-voluntaristic&quot;, and &quot;de-humanizing&quot; by the sheer nature of its intrinsic theoretical context.

By the same token, his evolutionary theory was regarded as &quot;uni-linear&quot;, &quot;mechanical&quot;, &quot;biologistic&quot;, an ode to world system status quo, or simply an ill-concealed instruction manual for &quot;the capitalist nation-state&quot;. The first manifestations of that branch of criticism would be intellectuals like Lewis Coser, Ralf Dahrendorf, David Lockwood, John Rex, C. Wright Mills, Tom Bottomore and Gouldner.

===Democratic Party supporter===
Parsons supported John F. Kennedy on November 8, 1960; from 1923, with one exception, Parsons voted for Democrats all his life. He discussed the Kennedy election widely in his correspondence at the time. Parsons was especially interested in the symbolic implications involved in the fact of Kennedy&#x27;s Catholic background for the implications for the United States as an integral community (it was the first time that a Catholic had become President of the United States).

In a letter to Robert N. Bellah, he wrote, &quot;I am sure you have been greatly intrigued by the involvement of the religious issue in our election.&quot; Parsons, who described himself as a &quot;Stevenson Democrat&quot;, was especially enthusiastic that his favored politician, Adlai Stevenson II, had been appointed United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Parsons had supported Stevenson in 1952 and 1956 and was greatly disappointed that Stevenson lost heavily both times.

===Modernization theory influence===
In the early 1960s, it became obvious that his ideas had a great impact on much of the theories of modernization at the time. His influence was very extensive but at the same time, the concrete adoption of his theory was often quite selective, half-hearted, superficial, and eventually confused. Many modernization theorists never used the full power of Parsons&#x27; theory but concentrated on some formalist formula, which often was taken out of the context that had the deeper meaning with which Parsons originally introduced them.

In works by Gabriel A. Almond and James S. Coleman, Karl W. Deutsch, S. N. Eisenstadt, Seymour Martin Lipset, Samuel P. Huntington, David E. Apter, Lucian W. Pye, Sidney Verba, and Chalmers Johnson, and others, Parsons&#x27; influence is clear. Indeed, it was the intensive influence of Parsons&#x27; ideas in political sociology that originally got scholar William Buxton interested in his work. In addition, David Easton would claim that in the history of political science, the two scholars who had made any serious attempt to construct a general theory for political science on the issue of political support were Easton and Parsons.

===Interest in religion===
One of the scholars with whom he corresponded extensively with during his lifetime and whose opinion he highly valued was Robert N. Bellah. Parsons&#x27;s discussion with Bellah would cover a wide range of topics, including the theology of Paul Tillich. The correspondence would continue when Bellah, in the early fall of 1960, went to Japan to study Japanese religion and ideology. In August 1960, Parsons sent Bellah a draft of his paper on &quot;The Religious Background of the American Value System&quot; to ask for his commentary.

In a letter to Bellah of September 30, 1960, Parsons discussed his reading of Perry Miller&#x27;s &quot;Errand into the Wilderness&quot;. Parsons wrote that Miller&#x27;s discussion of the role of Calvinism &quot;in the early New England theology... is a first rate and fit beautifully with the broad position I have taken.&quot; Miller was a literary Harvard historian whose books such as &quot;The New England Mind&quot; established new standards for the writing of American cultural and religious history. Miller remained one of Parsons&#x27; most favoured historians throughout his life. Indeed, religion had always a special place in Parsons&#x27; heart, but his son, in an interview, maintained that he that his father was probably not really &quot;religious.&quot;

Throughout his life, Parsons interacted with a broad range of intellectuals and others who took a deep interest in religious belief systems, doctrines, and institutions. One notable person who interacted with Parsons was Marie Augusta Neal, a nun of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur who sent Parsons a huge number of her manuscripts and invited him to conferences and intellectual events in her Catholic Church. Neal received her PhD from Harvard under Parsons&#x27;s supervision in 1963, and she would eventually become professor and then chair of sociology at Emmanuel College.

===Criticism of Riesman===
Parsons and Winston White cowrote an article, &quot;The Link Between Character and Society&quot;, which was published in 1961. It was a critical discussion of David Riesman&#x27;s &quot;The Lonely Crowd,&quot; which had been published a decade earlier and had turned into an unexpected bestseller, reaching 1 million sold copies in 1977. Riesman was a prominent member of the American academic left, influenced by Erich Fromm and the Frankfurt School. In reality, Riesman&#x27;s book was an academic attempt to give credit to the concept of &quot;mass society&quot; and especially to the idea of an America suffocated in social conformity. Riesman had essentially argued that at the emerging of highly advanced capitalism, the America basic value system and its socializing roles had changed from an &quot;inner-directed&quot; toward an &quot;other-directed&quot; pattern of value-orientation.

Parsons and White challenged Riesman&#x27;s idea and argued that there had been no change away from an inner-directed personality structure. The said that Riesman&#x27;s &quot;other-directness&quot; looked like a caricature of Charles Cooley&#x27;s looking-glass self, and they argued that the framework of &quot;institutional individualism&quot; as the basic code-structure of America&#x27;s normative system had essentially not changed. What had happened, however, was that the industrialized process and its increased pattern of societal differentiation had changed the family&#x27;s generalized symbolic function in society and had allowed for a greater permissiveness in the way the child related to its parents. Parsons and White argued that was not the prelude to greater &quot;otherdirectness&quot; but a more complicated way by which inner-directed pattern situated itself in the social environment.

===Political power and social influence===
1963 was a notable year in Parsons&#x27;s theoretical development because it was the year when he published two important articles: one on political power and one on the concept of social influence. The two articles represented Parsons&#x27;s first published attempt to work out the idea of Generalized Symbolic Media as an integral part of the exchange processes within the AGIL system. It was a theoretical development, which Parsons had worked on ever since the publication of &quot;Economy and Society&quot; (1956).

The prime model for the generalized symbolic media was money and Parsons was reflecting on the question whether the functional characteristics of money represented an exclusive uniqueness of the economic system or whether it was possible to identify other generalized symbolic media in other subsystems as well. Although each medium had unique characteristics, Parsons claimed that power (for the political system) and influence (for the societal community) had institutional functions, which essentially was structurally similar to the general systemic function of money. Using Roman Jakobson&#x27;s idea of &quot;code&quot; and &quot;message&quot;, Parsons divided the components of the media into a question of value-principle versus coordination standards for the &quot;code-structure&quot; and the question of factor versus product control within those social process which carried the &quot;message&quot; components. While &quot;utility&quot; could be regarded as the value-principle for the economy (medium: money), &quot;effectiveness&quot; was the value-principle for the political system (by political power) and social solidarity for the societal community (by social influence). Parsons would eventually choose the concept of value-commitment as the generalized symbolic medium for the fiduciary system with integrity as the value principle.

===Contacts with other scholars===
In August 1963, Parsons got a new research assistant, Victor Lidz, who would become an important collaborator and colleague. In 1964, Parsons flew to Heidelberg to celebrate the 100th birthday of Weber and discuss Weber&#x27;s work with Habermas, Herbert Marcuse, and others. Parsons delivered his paper &quot;Evaluation and Objectivity in Social Science: An Interpretation of Max Weber&#x27;s Contribution&quot;. The meeting became mostly a clash between pro-Weberian scholars and the Frankfurt School. Before leaving for Germany, Parsons discussed the upcoming meeting with Reinhard Bendix and commented, &quot;I am afraid I will be something of a Daniel in the Lion&#x27;s den.&quot; Bendix wrote back and told Parsons that Marcuse sounded very much like Christoph Steding, a Nazi philosopher.

Parsons conducted a persistent correspondence with noted scholar Benjamin Nelson, and they shared a common interest in the rise and the destiny of civilizations until Nelson&#x27;s death in 1977. The two scholars also shared a common enthusiasm for the work of Weber and would generally agree on the main interpretative approach to the study of Weber. Nelson had participated in the Weber Centennial in Heidelberg.

Parsons was opposed to the Vietnam War but was disturbed by what he considered the anti-intellectual tendency in the student rebellion: that serious debate was often substituted by handy slogans from communists Karl Marx, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro.

===Opposition to the Frankfurt School===
Nelson got into a violent argument with Herbert Marcuse and accused him of tarnishing Weber. In reading the written version of Nelson&#x27;s contribution to the Weber Centennial, Parsons wrote, &quot;I cannot let the occasion pass without a word of congratulations which is strong enough so that if it were concert I should shout bravo.&quot; In several letters, Nelson would keep Parsons informed of the often-turbulent leftist environment of Marcuse. In the letter of September 1967, Nelson would tell Parsons how much he enjoyed reading Parsons&#x27; essay on &quot;Kinship and The Associational Aspect of Social Structure&quot;. Also, one of the scholars on whose work Parsons and Nelson would share internal commentaries was Habermas.

===Ethnicity, kinship, and diffuse solidarity===
Parsons had for years corresponded with his former graduate student David M. Schneider, who had taught at the University of California Berkeley until the latter, in 1960, accepted a position as professor in anthropology at the University of Chicago. Schneider had received his PhD at Harvard in social anthropology in 1949 and had become a leading expert on the American kinship system. Schneider, in 1968, published &quot;American Kinship: A Cultural Account&quot; which became a classic in the field, and he had sent Parsons a copy of the copyedited manuscript before its publication. Parsons was highly appreciative of Schneider&#x27;s work, which became in many ways a crucial turning point in his own attempt to understand the fundamental elements of the American kinship system, a key to understanding the factor of ethnicity and especially building the theoretical foundation of his concept of the societal community, which, by the beginning of the early 1970s, had become a strong priority in the number of theoretical projects of his own intellectual life.

Parsons borrowed the term &quot;diffuse enduring solidarity&quot; from Schneider, as a major concept for his own considerations on the theoretical construction of the concept of the societal community. In the spring of 1968, Parsons and Schneider had discussed Clifford Geertz&#x27;s article on religion as a cultural system on which Parsons wrote a review. Parsons, who was a close friend of Geertz, was puzzled over Geertz&#x27;s article. In a letter to Schneider, Parsons spoke about &quot;the rather sharp strictures on what he [Geertz] calls the extremely narrow intellectual tradition with special reference to Weber, but also to Durkheim. My basic point is in this respect, he greatly overstated his case seeming to argue that this intellectual tradition was by now irrelevant.&quot;

Schneider wrote back to Parsons, &quot;So much, so often, as I read Cliff&#x27;s stuff I cannot get a clear consistent picture of just what the religious system consist in instead only how it is said to work.&quot;

In a letter of July 1968 to Gene Tanke of the University of California Press, Parsons offered a critical note on the state of psychoanalytical theory and wrote: &quot;The use of psychoanalytical theory in interpretation of social and historical subject matter is somewhat hazardous enterprise, and a good deal of nonsense has been written in the name of such attempts.&quot; Around 1969, Parsons was approached by the prestigious &quot;Encyclopedia of the History of Idea&quot; about writing an entry in the encyclopedia on the topic of the &quot;Sociology of Knowledge&quot;. Parsons accepted and wrote one of his most powerful essays, &quot;The Sociology of Knowledge and the History of Ideas&quot;, in 1969 or 1970. Parsons discussed how the sociology of knowledge, as a modern intellectual discipline, had emerged from the dynamics of European intellectual history and had reached a kind of cutting point in the philosophy of Kant and further explored by Hegel but reached its first &quot;classical&quot; formulation in the writing of Mannheim, whose brilliance Parsons acknowledged but disagreed with his German historicism for its antipositivistic epistemology; that was largely rejected in the more positivistic world of American social science. For various reasons, the editors of the encyclopedia turned down Parsons&#x27; essay, which did not fit the general format of their volume. The essay was not published until 2006.

Parsons had several conversations with Daniel Bell on a &quot;post-industrial society&quot;, some of which were conducted over lunch at William James Hall. After reading an early version of Bell&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society&quot;, Parsons wrote a letter to Bell, dated November 30, 1971, to offer his criticism. Among his many critical points, Parsons stressed especially that Bell&#x27;s discussion of technology tended to &quot;separate off culture&quot; and treat the two categories &quot;as what I would call culture minus the cognitive component&quot;.

Parsons&#x27; interest in the role of ethnicity and religion in the genesis of social solidarity within the local community heavily influenced another of his early 1960s graduate students, Edward Laumann. As a student, Laumann was interested in the role of social network structure in shaping community-level solidarity. Combining Parsons&#x27; interest in the role of ethnicity in shaping local community solidarity with W. Lloyd Warner&#x27;s structural approach to social class, Laumann argued that ethnicity, religion, and perceived social class all play a large role in structuring community social networks. Laumann&#x27;s work found that community networks are highly partitioned along lines of ethnicity, religion, and occupational social status. It also highlighted the tension individuals experience between their preference to associate with people who are like them (homophily) and their simultaneous desire to affiliate with higher-status others. Later, at the beginning of his career at the University of Chicago, Laumann would argue that how the impulses are resolved by individuals forms the basis of corporate or competitive class consciousness within a given community. In addition to demonstrating how community solidarity can be conceptualized as a social network and the role of ethnicity, religion, and class in shaping such networks, Laumann&#x27;s dissertation became one of the first examples of the use of population-based surveys in the collection of social network data, and thus a precursor to decades of egocentric social network analysis. Parsons thus played an important role in shaping the early interest of social network analysis in homophily and the use of egocentric network data to assess group- and community-level social network structures.

===Systems theory on biological and social systems===
In his later years, Parsons became increasingly interested in working out the higher conceptual parameters of the human condition, which was in part what led him toward rethinking questions of cultural and social evolution and the &quot;nature&quot; of telic systems, the latter which he especially discussed with Bellah, Lidz, Fox, Willy de Craemer, and others. Parsons became increasingly interested in clarifying the relationship between biological and social theory. Parsons was the initiator of the first Daedalus conference on &quot;Some Relations between Biological and Social Theory&quot;, sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Parsons wrote a memorandum dated September 16, 1971, in which he spelled out the intellectual framework for the conference. As Parsons explained in the memo, the basic goal of the conference was to establish a conceptual fundament for a theory of living systems. The first conference was held on January 7, 1972. Among the participants beside Parsons and Lidz were Ernst Mayr, Seymour Kety, Gerald Holton, A. Hunter Dupree, and William K. Wimsatt. A second Daedalus Conference on Living Systems was held on March 1–2, 1974 and included Edward O. Wilson, who was about to publish his famous work on sociobiology. Other new participants were John T. Bonner, Karl H. Pribram, Eric Lennenberg, and Stephen J. Gould.

===Sociology of law===
Parsons began in the fall of 1972 to conduct a seminar on &quot;Law and Sociology&quot; with legal philosopher Lon L. Fuller, well known for his book &quot;The Morality of Law&quot; (1964). The seminar and conversations with Fuller stimulated Parsons to write one of his most influential articles, &quot;Law as an Intellectual Stepchild&quot;. Parsons discuses Roberto Mangabeira Unger&#x27;s &quot;Law in Modern Society&quot; (1976). Another indication of Parsons&#x27; interest in law was reflected in his students, such as John Akula, who wrote his dissertation in sociology, &quot;Law and the Development of Citizenship&quot; (1973). In September 1972, Parsons participated in a conference in Salzburg on &quot;The Social Consequences of Modernization in Socialist Countries&quot;. Among the other participants were Alex Inkeles, Ezra Vogel, and Ralf Dahrendorf.

===Criticism of Bendix===
In 1972, Parsons wrote two review articles to discuss the work of Bendix, which provide a clear statement on Parsons&#x27; approach to the study of Weber. Bendix had become well known for his interpretations of Weber. In the first review article, Parsons analyzed the immigrant Bendix&#x27;s &quot;Embattled Reason&quot;, and he praised its attempt to defend the basic values of cognitive rationality, which he unconditionally shared, and he agreed with Bendix that the question of cognitive rationality was primarily a cultural issue, not a category that could be reduced from biological, economic, and social factors. However, Parsons criticized how Bendix had proceeded, who he felt especially had misrepresented the work of Freud and Durkheim. Parsons found that the misrepresentation was how Bendix tended to conceive the question of systematic theorizing, under the concept of &quot;reductionism&quot;. Parsons further found that Bendix&#x27;s approach suffered from a &quot;conspicuous hostility&quot; to the idea of evolution. Although Parsons assessed that Weber rejected the linear evolutionary approaches of Marx and Herbert Spencer, Weber might not have rejected the question of evolution as a generalized question.

In a second article, a review of Bendix and Guenther Roth&#x27;s &quot;Scholarship and Partisanship: Essays on Max Weber&quot;, Parsons continued his line of criticism. Parsons was especially concerned with a statement by Bendix that claimed Weber believed Marx&#x27;s notion that ideas were &quot;the epiphenomena of the organization of production&quot;. Parsons strongly rejected that interpretation: &quot;I should contend that certainly the intellectual &#x27;mature&#x27; Weber never was an &#x27;hypothetical&#x27; Marxist.&quot; Somewhere behind the attitudes of Bendix, Parsons detected a discomfort for the former to move out of an &quot;idiographic&quot; mode of theorizing.

===Study of US university===
In 1973, Parsons published &quot;The American University&quot;, which he had authored with Gerald M. Platt. The idea had originally emerged when Martin Meyerson and Stephen Graubard of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, in 1969, asked Parsons to undertake a monographic study of the American university system. The work on the book went on for years until it was finished in June 1972.

From a theoretical point of view, the book had several functions. It substantiated Parsons&#x27; concept of the educational revolution, a crucial component in his theory of the rise of the modern world. What was equally intellectually compelling, however, was Parsons&#x27; discussion of &quot;the cognitive complex&quot;, aimed at explaining how cognitive rationality and learning operated as an interpenetrative zone on the level of the general action-system in society. In retrospect, the categories of the cognitive complex are a theoretical foundation to understand what has been called the modern knowledge-based society.

==Retirement==
He officially retired from Harvard in 1973 but continued his writing, teaching, and other activities in the same rapid pace as before. Parsons also continued his extensive correspondence with a wide group of colleagues and intellectuals. He taught at the University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, Rutgers University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California at Berkeley. At Parsons&#x27; retirement banquet, on May 18, 1973, Robert K. Merton was asked to preside, while John Riley, Bernard Barber, Jesse Pitts, Neil J. Smelser, and John Akula were asked to share their experiences of the man with the audience.

===Brown seminars===
One scholar who became important in Parsons&#x27; later years was professor Martin U. Martel, of Brown University. They had made contact in the early 1970s at a discussion of an article that Martel had written about Parsons&#x27; work. Martel arranged a series of seminars at Brown University in 1973 to 1974, and Parsons spoke about his life and work and answered questions from students and faculty. Among the participants at the seminars were Martel, Robert M. Marsh, Dietrich Rueschemeyer, C. Parker Wolf, Albert F. Wessen, A. Hunter Dupree, Philip L. Quinn, Adrian Hayes and Mark A. Shields. In February to May 1974, Parsons also gave the Culver Lectures at Brown and spoke on &quot;The Evolution of Society&quot;. The lectures and were videotaped.

===Refinement of AGIL model===
Late in life, Parsons began to work out a new level of the AGIL model, which he called &quot;A Paradigm of the Human Condition&quot;. The new level of the AGIL model crystallized in the summer of 1974. He worked out the ideas of the new paradigm with a variety of people but especially Lidz, Fox and Harold Bershady. The new metaparadigm featured the environment of the general action system, which included the physical system, the biological system, and what Parsons called the telic system. The telic system represents the sphere of ultimate values in a sheer metaphysical sense. Parsons also worked toward a more comprehensive understanding of the code-structure of social systems and on the logic of the cybernetic pattern of control facilitating the AGIL model. He wrote a bulk of notes: two being &quot;Thoughts on the Linking of Systems&quot; and &quot;Money and Time&quot;. He had also extensive discussions with Larry Brownstein and Adrian Hayes on the possibility of a mathematical formalization of Parsons&#x27; theory.

===Sick role theory===
Parsons had worked intensively with questions of medical sociology, the medical profession, psychiatry, psychosomatic problems, and the questions of health and illness. Most of all Parsons had become known for his concept of &quot;the Sick role&quot;. The last field of social research was an issue that Parsons constantly developed through elaboration and self-criticism. Parsons participated at the World Congress of Sociology in Toronto in August 1974 at which he presented a paper, &quot;The Sick Role Revisited: A Response to Critics and an Updating in Terms of the Theory of Action&quot;, which was published under a slightly different title, &quot;The Sick Role and the Role of the Physician Reconsidered&quot;, in 1975. In this essay, Parsons highlighted that his concept of &quot;sick role&quot; never was meant to be confined to &quot;deviant behavior&quot;, but &quot;its negative valuation should not be forgotten&quot;. It was also important to keep a certain focus on the &quot;motivatedness&quot; of illness, since there is always a factor of unconscious motivation in the therapeutic aspects of the sick role.

===Criticism of broken covenant theory===
In 1975, Bellah published &quot;The Broken Covenant&quot;. Bellah referred to the sermon delivered by John Winthrop (1587–1649) to his flock on the ship &quot;Arbella&quot; on the evening of the landing in Massachusetts Bay in 1630. Winthrop declared that the Puritan colonists&#x27; emigration to the New World was part of a covenant, a special pact with God, to create a holy community and noted: &quot;For we must consider that we shall be a city on the hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.&quot; Parsons disagreed strongly with Bellah&#x27;s analysis and insisted that the covenant was not broken. Parsons later used much of his influential article, &quot;Law as an Intellectual Stepchild&quot;, to discuss Bellah&#x27;s position.

Parsons thought that Bellah trivialized the tensions of individual interests and society&#x27;s interests by reducing them to &quot;capitalism&quot;; Bellah, in his characterization of the negative aspects of American society, was compelled by a charismatic-based optimalism moral absolutism.

===Symbolic interactionism===
In 1975, Parsons responded to an article by Jonathan H. Turner, &quot;Parsons as a Symbolic Interactionist: A Comparison of Action and Interaction Theory&quot;. Parsons acknowledged that action theory and symbolic interactionism should not be regarded as two separate, antagonistic positions but have overlapping structures of conceptualization. Parsons regarded symbolic interactionism and the theory of George Herbert Mead as valuable contributions to action theory that specify certain aspects of the theory of the personality of the individual. Parsons, however, criticized the symbolic interactionism of Herbert Blumer since Blumer&#x27;s theory had no end to the openness of action. Parsons regarded Blumer as the mirror image of Claude Lévi-Strauss, who tended to stress the quasi-determined nature of macro-structural systems. Action theory, Parsons maintained, represented a middle ground between both extremes.

===Review of Piaget===
In 1976, Parsons was asked to contribute to a volume to celebrate the 80th birthday of Jean Piaget. Parsons contributed with an essay, &quot;A Few Considerations on the Place of Rationality in Modern Culture and Society&quot;. Parsons characterized Piaget as the most eminent contributor to cognitive theory in the 20th century. However, he also argued that the future study of cognition had to go beyond its narrow encounter with psychology to aim at a higher understanding of how cognition as a human intellectual force was entangled in the processes of social and cultural institutionalization.

In 1978, when James Grier Miller published his famous work &quot;Living Systems&quot;, Parsons was approached by &quot;Contemporary Sociology&quot; to write a review article on Miller&#x27;s work. Parsons had already complained in a letter to A. Hunter Dupree that American intellectual life suffered from a deep-seated tradition of empiricism and saw Miller&#x27;s book the latest confirmation of that tradition. In his review, &quot;Concrete Systems and &quot;Abstracted Systems&quot;, he generally praised the herculean task behind Miller&#x27;s work but criticized Miller for getting caught in the effort of hierarchize concrete systems but underplay the importance of structural categories in theory building. Parsons also complained about Miller&#x27;s lack of any clear distinction between cultural and non-cultural systems.

===Lectures in Japan===
Japan had long been a keen interest in Parsons&#x27; work. As early as 1958, a Japanese translation of &quot;Economy and Society&quot; appeared. Also, &quot;The Structure of Social Action&quot; was translated into Japanese. &quot;The Social System&quot; was translated into Japanese by Tsutomu Sato in 1974. Indeed, Ryozo Takeda had, as early as 1952 in his &quot;Shakaigaku no Kozo (&quot;The Framework of Sociology&quot;)&quot; introduced Japanese scholars to some of Parsons&#x27; ideas. Parsons had visited Japan for the first time in 1972 and he gave a lecture on November 25 to the Japanese Sociological Association, &quot;Some Reflections on Post-Industrial Society&quot; that was published in &quot;The Japanese Sociological Review&quot;. At the same time, Parsons participated in an international symposium on &quot;New Problems of Advanced Societies&quot;, held in Tokyo, and he wrote short articles written that appeared in the proceedings of the symposium. Tominaga, born in 1931, a leading figure in Japanese sociology and a professor at the University of Tokyo, was asked by Lidz to contribute to a two-volume collection of essays to honor Parsons. Tominaga wrote an essay on the industrial growth model of Japan and used Parsons&#x27; AGIL model.

In 1977, Washio Kurata, the new dean of the Faculty of Sociology of Kwansei Gakuin University, wrote to Parsons and invited him to visit Japan during the 1978–1979 academic year. In early spring, Parsons accepted the invitation, and on October 20, 1978, Parsons arrived at the Osaka Airport, accompanied by his wife, and was greeted by a large entourage.

Parsons began weekly lectures at Kwansei&#x27;s sociology department from October 23 to December 15. Parsons gave his first public lecture to a huge mass of undergraduates, &quot;The Development of Contemporary Sociology&quot;.

On November 17–18, when the Sengari Seminar House was opened, Parsons was invited as the key speaker at the event and gave two lectures, &quot;On the Crisis of Modern Society&quot; and &quot;Modern Society and Religion&quot;. Present were Tominaga, Mutsundo Atarashi, Kazuo Muto, and Hideichiro Nakano.

On November 25, lectures at Kobe University were organized by Hiroshi Mannari. Parsons lectured on organization theory to the faculty and the graduate students from the Departments of Economics, Management and Sociology. Also, faculty members from Kyoto and Osaka universities were present. A text was published the next year. On November 30 to December 1, Parsons participated in a Tsukuba University Conference in Tokyo; Parsons spoke on &quot;Enter the New Society: The Problem of the Relationship of Work and Leisure in Relation to Economic and Cultural Values&quot;.

On December 5, Parsons gave a lecture at Kyoto University on &quot;A Sociologist Looks at Contemporary U.S. Society&quot;.

At a special lecture at Osaka on December 12, Parsons spoke, at the suggestion of Tominaga, on &quot;Social System Theory and Organization Theory&quot; to the Japanese Sociological Association.

On December 14, Kwansei Gakuin University granted Parsons an honorary doctor degree. Some of his lectures would be collected into a volume by Kurata and published in 1983. The Parsons flew back to the US in mid-December 1978.

==Death==
Parsons died May 8, 1979, in Munich on a trip to Germany, where he was celebrating the 50th anniversary of his degree at Heidelberg. The day before, he had given a lecture on social class to an audience of German intellectuals, including Habermas, Niklas Luhmann and Wolfgang Schluchter.

==Work==
Parsons produced a general theoretical system for the analysis of society, which he called &quot;theory of action&quot;, based on the methodological and epistemological principle of &quot;analytical realism&quot; and on the ontological assumption of &quot;voluntaristic action&quot;. Parsons&#x27; concept of analytical realism can be regarded as a kind of compromise between nominalist and realist views on the nature of reality and human knowledge. Parsons believed that objective reality can be related to only by a particular encounter of such reality and that general intellectual understanding is feasible through conceptual schemes and theories. Interaction with objective reality on an intellectual level should always be understood as an approach. Parsons often explained the meaning of analytical realism by quoting a statement by Henderson: &quot;A fact is a statement about experience in terms of a conceptual scheme.&quot;

Generally, Parsons maintained that his inspiration regarding analytical realism had been Lawrence Joseph Henderson and Alfred North Whitehead although he might have gotten the idea much earlier. It is important for Parsons&#x27; &quot;analytical realism&quot; to insist on the reference to an objective reality since he repeatedly highlighted that his concept of &quot;analytical realism&quot; was very different from the &quot;fictionalism&quot; of Hans Vaihiger (Hans Vaihinger):
===&quot;The Structure of Social Action&quot;===
&quot;The Structure of Social Action&quot; (SSA), Parsons&#x27; most famous work, took form piece by piece. Its central figure was Weber, and the other key figures in the discussion were added, little by little, as the central idea took form. One important work that helped Parsons&#x27; central argument in was, in 1932, unexpectedly found: Élie Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La formation du radicalisme philosophique&quot; (1901–1904); he read the three-volume work in French. Parsons explained, &quot;Well, Halévy was just a different world ... and helped me to really get in to many clarifications of the assumptions distinctive to the main line of British utilitarian thought; assumptions about the &#x27;natural identity of interest&#x27;, and so on. I still think it is one of the true masterpieces in intellectual history.&quot; Parsons first achieved significant recognition with the publication of &quot;The Structure of Social Action&quot; (1937), his first grand synthesis, combining the ideas of Durkheim, Weber, Pareto, and others. In 1998, the International Sociological Association listed it as the ninth most important sociological book of the 20th Century.

===Action theory===
Parsons&#x27; action theory can be characterized as an attempt to maintain the scientific rigour of positivism while acknowledging the necessity of the &quot;subjective dimension&quot; of human action incorporated in hermeneutic types of sociological theories. It is cardinal in Parsons&#x27; general theoretical and methodological view that human action must be understood in conjunction with the motivational component of the human act. Social science must consider the question of ends, purpose, and ideals in its analysis of human action. Parsons&#x27; strong reaction to behavioristic theory as well as to sheer materialistic approaches derives from the attempt of the theoretical positions to eliminate ends, purpose, and ideals as factors of analysis. Parsons, in his term papers at Amherst, was already criticizing attempts to reduce human life to psychological, biological, or materialist forces. What was essential in human life, Parsons maintained, was how the factor of culture was codified. Culture, however, was to Parsons an independent variable in that it could not be &quot;deducted&quot; from any other factor of the social system. That methodological intention is given the most elaborate presentation in &quot;The Structure of Social Action,&quot; which was Parsons&#x27; first basic discussion of the methodological foundation of the social sciences.

Some of the themes in &quot;The Structure of Social Action&quot; had been presented in a compelling essay two years earlier in &quot;The Place of Ultimate Values in Sociological Theory&quot;.

An intense correspondence and dialogue between Talcott Parsons and Alfred Schutz serves to highlight the meaning of central concepts in &quot;The Structure of Social Action.&quot;

===Relations to cybernetics and system theory===
Parsons developed his ideas during a period when systems theory and cybernetics were very much on the front burner of social and behavioral science. In using systems thinking, he postulated that the relevant systems treated in social and behavioral science were &quot;open:&quot; they were embedded in an environment with other systems. For social and behavioral science, the largest system is &quot;the action system,&quot; the interrelated behaviors of human beings, embedded in a physical-organic environment.

As Parsons developed his theory, it became increasingly bound to the fields of cybernetics and system theory but also to Emerson&#x27;s concept of homeostasis and Ernst Mayr&#x27;s concept of &quot;teleonomic processes&quot;. On the metatheoretical level, Parson attempted to balance psychologist phenomenology and idealism on the one hand and pure types of what Parsons called the utilitarian-positivistic complex, on the other hand.

The theory includes a general theory of social evolution and a concrete interpretation of the major drives of world history. In Parsons&#x27; theory of history and evolution, the constitutive-cognitive symbolization of the cybernetic hierarchy of action-systemic levels has, in principle, the same function as genetic information in DNA&#x27;s control of biological evolution, but that factor of metasystemic control does not &quot;determine&quot; any outcome but defines the orientational boundaries of the real pathfinder, which is action itself. Parsons compares the constitutive level of society with Noam Chomsky&#x27;s concept of &quot;deep structure&quot;.

As Parsons wrote, &quot;The deep structures do not as such articulate any sentences which could convey coherent meaning. The surface structures constitute the level at which this occurs. The connecting link between them is a set of rules of transformation, to use Chomsky&#x27;s own phrase.&quot; The transformative processes and entities are generally, at least on one level of empirical analysis, performed or actualized by myths and religions, but philosophies, art systems, or even semiotic consumer behavior can, in principle, perform that function.

===Unified concept of social science===
Parsons&#x27; theory reflects a vision of a unified concept of social science and indeed of living systems in general. His approach differs in essence from Niklas Luhmann&#x27;s theory of social systems because Parsons rejects the idea that systems can be autopoietic, short of the actual action system of individual actors. Systems have immanent capacities but only as an outcome of the institutionalized processes of action-systems, which, in the final analysis, is the historical effort of individual actors. While Luhmann focused on the systemic immanence, Parsons insisted that the question of autocatalytic and homeostatic processes and the question about the actor as the ultimate &quot;first mover&quot; on the other hand was not mutually exclusive. Homeostatic processes might be necessary if and when they occur but action is necessitating.

It is only that perspective of the ultimate reference in action that Parsons&#x27; dictum (that higher-order cybernetic systems in history will tend to control social forms that are organized on the lower levels of the cybernetic hierarchy) should be understood. For Parsons, the highest levels of the cybernetic hierarchy as far as the general action level is concerned is what Parsons calls the constitutive part of the cultural system (the L of the L). However, within the interactional processes of the system, attention should be paid especially to the cultural-expressivistic axis (the L-G line in the AGIL). By the term &quot;constitutive&quot;, Parsons generally referred to very highly codified cultural values especially religious elements (but other interpretation of the term &quot;constitutive&quot; is possible).

Cultural systems have an independent status from that of the normative and orientational pattern of the social system; neither system can be reduced to the other. For example, the question of the &quot;cultural capital&quot; of a social system as a sheer historical entity (in its function as a &quot;fiduciary system&quot;), is not identical to the higher cultural values of that system; that is, the cultural system is embodied with a metastructural logic that cannot be reduced to any given social system or cannot be viewed as a materialist (or behavioralist) deduction from the &quot;necessities&quot; of the social system (or from the &quot;necessities&quot; of its economy). Within that context, culture would have an independent power of transition, not only as factors of actual sociocultural units (like Western civilization) but also how original cultural bases would tend to &quot;universalize&quot; through interpenetration and spread over large numbers of social systems as with Classical Greece and Ancient Israel, where the original social bases had died but the cultural system survived as an independently &quot;working&quot; cultural pattern, as in the case of Greek philosophy or in the case of Christianity, as a modified derivation from its origins in Israel.

===General theory===
It is important to highlight that Parsons distinguished two &quot;meanings&quot; or modes of the term &quot;general theory&quot;. He sometimes wrote about general theory as aspects of theoretical concerns of social sciences whose focus is on the most &quot;constitutive&quot; elements of cognitive concern for the basic theoretical systematization of a given field. Parsons would include the basic conceptual scheme for the given field, including its highest order of theoretical relations and naturally also the necessary specification of this system&#x27;s axiomatic, epistemological, and methodological foundations from the point of view of logical implications. All the elements would signify the quest for a general theory on the highest level of theoretical concern.

However, general theory could also refer to a more fully/operational system whose implications of the conceptual scheme were &quot;spelled out&quot; on lower levels of cognitive structuralization, levels standing closer to a perceived &quot;empirical object&quot;. In his speech to the American Sociological Society in 1947, he spoke of five levels:
# The General Theory level, which took form primarily as a theory of social systems.
# The theory of motivation of social behavior, which especially addressed questions of the dynamics of the social system and naturally presupposed theories of motivation, personality and socialization.
# The theoretical bases of systematic comparative analysis of social structure, which would involve a study of concrete cultures in concrete systems on various levels of generalization.
# Special theories around particular empirical problem areas.
# The &quot;fitting&quot; of the theories to specific empirical research techniques, such as statistics, and survey techniques.

During his life, he would work on developing all five fields of theoretical concerns but pay special attention to the development on the highest &quot;constitutive&quot; level, as the rest of the building would stand or fall on the solidity of the highest level.

Despite myths, Parsons never thought that modern societies exist in some kind of perfect harmony with their norms or that most modern societies were necessarily characterized by some high level of consensus or a &quot;happy&quot; institutional integration. Parsons highlighted that is almost logically impossible that there can be any &quot;perfect fit&quot; or perfect consensus in the basic normative structure of complex modern societies because the basic value pattern of modern societies is generally differentiated in such a way that some of the basic normative categories exist in inherent or at least potential conflict with each other. For example, freedom and equality are generally viewed as fundamental and non-negotiable values of modern societies. Each represents a kind of ultimate imperative about what the higher values of humanity. However, as Parsons emphasizes, no simple answer on the priority of freedom or equality or any simple solution on how they possibly can be mediated, if at all. Therefore, all modern societies are faced with the inherent conflict prevailing between the two values, and there is no &quot;eternal solution&quot; as such. There cannot be any perfect match between motivational pattern, normative solutions, and the prevailing value pattern in any modern society. Parsons also maintained that the &quot;dispute&quot; between &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; has something to do with the fact that they both defend ultimately &quot;justified&quot; human values (or ideals), which alone is indispensable as values but are always in an endless conflictual position to each other.

Parsons always maintained that the integration of the normative pattern in society is generally problematic and that the level of integration that is reached in principle is always far from harmonious and perfect. If some &quot;harmonious pattern&quot; emerges, it is related to specific historical circumstances but is not a general law of the social systems.

===AGIL paradigm===
The heuristic scheme that Parsons used to analyze systems and subsystems is called the &quot;AGIL paradigm&quot; or the &quot;AGIL scheme&quot;. To survive or maintain equilibrium with respect to its environment, any system must to some degree:

* adapt to that environment (adaptation)
* attain its goals (goal attainment)
* integrate its components (integration), and
* maintain its latent pattern (latency pattern Maintenance), a sort of cultural template

The concepts can be abbreviated as AGIL and are called the system&#x27;s functional imperatives. Parsons&#x27; AGIL model is an analytical scheme for the sake of theoretical &quot;production&quot;, but it is not any simple &quot;copy&quot; or any direct historical &quot;summary&quot; of empirical reality. Also, the scheme itself does not explain &quot;anything&quot;, just as the periodic table explains nothing by itself in the natural sciences. The AGIL scheme is a tool for explanations and is no better than the quality of the theories and explanation by which it is processed.

In the case of the analysis of a social action system, the AGIL paradigm, according to Parsons, yields four interrelated and interpenetrating subsystems: the behavioral systems of its members (A), the personality systems of those members (G), the social system (as such) (I), and the cultural system of that society (L). To analyze a society as a social system (the I subsystem of action), people are posited to enact roles associated with positions. The positions and roles become differentiated to some extent and, in a modern society, are associated with things such as occupational, political, judicial, and educational roles.

Considering the interrelation of these specialized roles as well as functionally differentiated collectivities (like firms and political parties), a society can be analyzed as a complex system of interrelated functional subsystems:

The pure AGIL model for all living systems:
* (A) Adaptation
* (G) Goal attainment
* (I) Integration
* (L) Latency (pattern maintenance)

The Social System Level:
* The economy — social adaptation to its action and non-action environmental systems
* The polity — collective goal attainment
* The societal community — the integration of its diverse social components
* The fiduciary system — processes that function to reproduce historical culture in its &quot;direct&quot; social embeddedness

The General Action Level:
* The behavioral organism (or system), in later versions, the foci for generalized &quot;intelligence&quot;.
* The personality system.
* The social system.
* The cultural system. (See cultural level.)

The cultural level:
* Cognitive symbolization
* Expressive symbolization
* Evaluative symbolization (sometimes called: moral-evaluative symbolization)
* Constitutive symbolization

The Generalized Symbolic media:

Social System level:
* (A) Economic system: Money
* (G) Political system: Political power
* (I) The Societal Community: Influence
* (L) The Fiduciary system (cultural tradition): Value-commitment

Parsons elaborated upon the idea that each of these systems also developed some specialized symbolic mechanisms of interaction analogous to money in the economy, like influence in the social community. Various processes of &quot;interchange&quot; among the subsystems of the social system were postulated.

Parsons&#x27; use of social systems analysis based on the AGIL scheme was established in his work &quot;Economy and Society&quot; (with N. Smelser, 1956) and prevailed in all his subsequent work. However, the AGIL system existed only in a &quot;rudimentary&quot; form in the beginning and was gradually elaborated and expanded in the decades which followed. A brief introduction to Parsons&#x27; AGIL scheme appears in Chapter 2 of &quot;The American University&quot;.
There is, however, no single place in his writing in which the total AGIL system is visually displayed or explained: the complete system has to be reconstructed from multiple places in his writing. The system displayed in &quot;The American University&quot; has only the most basic elements and should not be mistaken for the whole system.

===Social evolutionism===
Parsons contributed to social evolutionism and neoevolutionism. He divided evolution into four sub-processes:
# differentiation, which creates functional subsystems of the main system, as discussed above;
# adaptation, in which those systems evolve into more efficient versions;
# inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems; 
# generalization of values, increasing the legitimization of the increasingly-complex system.

Furthermore, Parsons explored the sub-processes within three stages of evolution:
# primitive
# archaic
# modern

Parsons viewed Western civilization as the pinnacle of modern societies and the United States as the one that is most dynamically developed.

Parsons&#x27; late work focused on a new theoretical synthesis around four functions that he claimed are common to all systems of action, from the behavioral to the cultural, and a set of symbolic media that enables communication across them. His attempt to structure the world of action according to a scheme that focused on order was unacceptable for American sociologists, who were retreating from the grand pretensions of the 1960s to a more empirical, grounded approach.

===Pattern variables===
Parsons asserted that there are not two dimensions to societies (instrumental and expressive) but that there are qualitative differences between kinds of social interaction.

He observed that people can have personalized and formally detached relationships, based on the roles that they play. The &quot;pattern variables&quot; are what he called the characteristics that are associated with each kind of interaction.

An interaction can be characterized by one of the identifiers of each contrastive pair:
* affectivity – affective neutrality
* self-orientation – collectivity-orientation
* universalism – particularism
* ascription – achievement
* specificity – diffusity

==Legacy==
From the 1940s to the 1970s, Parsons was one of the most famous and most influential but also most controversial sociologists in the world, particularly in the US. His later works were met with criticism and were generally dismissed in the 1970s by the view that his theories were too abstract, inaccessible, and socially conservative.

Recently, interest has increased in Parsons&#x27; ideas and especially often-overlooked later works. Attempts to revive his thinking have been made by Parsonsian sociologists and social scientists like Jeffrey Alexander, Bryan Turner, Richard Münch, and Roland Robertson, and Uta Gerhardt has written about Parsons from a biographical and historical perspective. In addition to the United States, the key centers of interest in Parsons today are Germany, Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

Parsons had a seminal influence and early mentorship of many American and international scholars, such as Ralf Dahrendorf, Alain Touraine, Niklas Luhmann, and Habermas. His best-known pupil was Merton. Parsons was a member of the American Philosophical Society.

<doc id="54044" wikidata="Q176483" url="?curid=54044" title="Gothic architecture">
<text>Gothic architecture is an architectural style that was prevalent in Europe from the late 12th to the 16th century, during the High and Late Middle Ages, surviving into the 17th and 18th centuries in some areas. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. It originated in the Île-de-France and Picardy regions of northern France. The style at the time was sometimes known as &quot;opus Francigenum&quot; (); the term &quot;Gothic&quot; was first applied contemptuously during the later Renaissance, by those ambitious to revive the architecture of classical antiquity.

The defining design element of Gothic architecture is the pointed arch. The use of the pointed arch in turn led to the development of the pointed rib vault and flying buttresses, combined with elaborate tracery and stained glass windows.

At the Abbey of Saint-Denis, near Paris, the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144, drawing together for the first time the developing Gothic architectural features. In doing so, a new architectural style emerged that emphasized verticality and the effect created by the transmission of light through stained glass windows.

Common examples are found in Christian ecclesiastical architecture, and Gothic cathedrals and churches, as well as abbeys, and parish churches. It is also the architecture of many castles, palaces, town halls, guildhalls, universities and, less prominently today, private dwellings. Many of the finest examples of medieval Gothic architecture are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.

With the development of Renaissance architecture in Italy during the mid-15th century, the Gothic style was supplanted by the new style, but in some regions, notably England and Belgium, Gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century. A series of Gothic revivals began in mid-18th century England, spread through 19th-century Europe and continued, largely for churches and university buildings, into the 20th century.

== Name ==
 Medieval contemporaries described the style as , as , , or as .

The term &quot;Gothic architecture&quot; originated as a pejorative description. Giorgio Vasari used the term &quot;barbarous German style&quot; in his &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot; to describe what is now considered the Gothic style, and in the introduction to the &quot;Lives&quot; he attributes various architectural features to the Goths, whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered Rome, and erecting new ones in this style. When Vasari wrote, Italy had experienced a century of building in the Vitruvian architectural vocabulary of classical orders revived in the Renaissance and seen as evidence of a new Golden Age of learning and refinement. Thus the Gothic style, being in opposition to classical architecture, from that point of view was associated with the destruction of advancement and sophistication. The assumption that classical architecture was better than Gothic architecture was widespread and proved difficult to defeat. Vasari was echoed in the 16th century by François Rabelais, who referred to Goths and Ostrogoths (&quot;Gotz&quot; and &quot;Ostrogotz&quot;).

The polymath architect Christopher Wren disapproved of the name Gothic for pointed architecture. He compared it to Islamic architecture, which he called the &#x27;Saracen style&#x27;, pointing out that the pointed arch&#x27;s sophistication was not owed to the Goths but to the Islamic Golden Age. He wrote:

Wren was the first to popularize the belief that it was not the Europeans, but the Saracens that had created the Gothic style. The term &#x27;Saracen&#x27; was still in use in the 18th century and it typically referred to all Muslims, including the Arabs and Berbers. Wren mentions Europe&#x27;s architectural debt to the Saracens no fewer than twelve times in his writings. He also decidedly broke with tradition in his assumption that Gothic architecture did not merely represent a violent and bothersome mistake, as suggested by Vasari. Rather, he saw that the Gothic style had developed over time along the lines of a changing society, and that it was thus a legitimate architectural style of its own.

It was no secret that Wren strongly disliked the building practices of the Gothic style. When he was appointed Surveyor of the Fabric at Westminster Abbey in the year 1698, he expressed his distaste for the Gothic style in a letter to the bishop of Rochester:

The chaos of the Gothic left much to be desired in Wren&#x27;s eyes. His aversion of the style was so strong that he refused to put a Gothic roof on the new St. Paul&#x27;s, despite being pressured to do so. Wren much preferred symmetry and straight lines in architecture, which is why he constantly praised the classic architecture of &#x27;the Ancients&#x27; in his writings.

Even though he openly expressed his distaste for the Gothic style, Wren did not blame the Saracens for the apparent lack of ingenuity. Quite the opposite: he praised the Saracens for their &#x27;superior&#x27; vaulting techniques and their widespread use of the pointed arch. Wren claimed the inventors of the Gothic had seen the Saracen architecture during the Crusades, also called the Religious war or Holy War, organised by the Kingdom of France in the year 1095:

There are several chronological issues that arise with this statement, which is one of the reasons why Wren&#x27;s theory is rejected by many. The earliest examples of the pointed arch in Europe date from before the Holy War in the year 1095; this is widely regarded as proof that the Gothic style could not have possibly been derived from Saracen architecture. Several authors have taken a stance against this allegation, claiming that the Gothic style had most likely filtered into Europe in other ways, for example through Spain or Sicily. The Spanish architecture from the Moors could have favoured the emergence of the Gothic style long before the Crusades took place. This could have happened gradually through merchants, travelers and pilgrims.

According to a 19th-century correspondent in the London journal &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;, Gothic was a derisive misnomer; the pointed arcs and architecture of the later Middle Ages was quite different from the rounded arches prevalent in late antiquity and the period of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy:There can be no doubt that the term &#x27;Gothic&#x27; as applied to pointed styles of ecclesiastical architecture was used at first contemptuously, and in derision, by those who were ambitious to imitate and revive the Grecian orders of architecture, after the revival of classical literature. But, without citing many authorities, such as Christopher Wren, and others, who lent their aid in depreciating the old mediaeval style, which they termed Gothic, as synonymous with every thing that was barbarous and rude, it may be sufficient to refer to the celebrated Treatise of Sir Henry Wotton, entitled &quot;The Elements of Architecture&quot;, ... printed in London so early as 1624. ... But it was a strange misapplication of the term to use it for the pointed style, in contradistinction to the circular, formerly called Saxon, now Norman, Romanesque, &amp;c. These latter styles, like Lombardic, Italian, and the Byzantine, of course belong more to the Gothic period than the light and elegant structures of the pointed order which succeeded them.
== Influences ==

The Gothic style of architecture was strongly influenced by the Romanesque architecture which preceded it; by the growing population and wealth of European cities, and by the desire to express local grandeur. It was influenced by theological doctrines which called for more light and by technical improvements in vaults and buttresses that allowed much greater height and larger windows. It was also influenced by the necessity of many churches, such as Chartres Cathedral and Canterbury Cathedral, to accommodate growing numbers of pilgrims. It adapted features from earlier styles. According to Charles Texier (French historian, architect, and archaeologist) and Josef Strzygowski (Polish-Austrian art historian), after lengthy research and study of cathedrals in the medieval city of Ani, the capital of the medieval kingdom of Armenia concluded to have discovered the oldest Gothic arch. According to these historians, the architecture of the Saint Hripsime Church near the Armenian religious seat Etchmiadzin was built in the fourth century A.D. and was repaired in 618. The cathedral of Ani was built in 980–1012 A.D. However many of the elements of Islamic and Armenian architecture that have been cited as influences on Gothic architecture also appeared in Late Roman and Byzantine architecture, the most noticeable example being the pointed arch and flying buttress. The most notable example is the capitals, which are forerunners of the Gothic style and deviated from the Classical standards of ancient Greece and Rome with serpentine lines and naturalistic forms.

== Periods ==
Architecture &quot;became a leading form of artistic expression during the late Middle Ages&quot;. Gothic architecture began in the earlier 12th century in northwest France and England and spread throughout Latin Europe in the 13th century; by 1300, a first &quot;international style&quot; of Gothic had developed, with common design features and formal language. A second &quot;international style&quot; emerged by 1400, alongside innovations in England and central Europe that produced both the perpendicular and flamboyant varieties. Typically, these typologies are identified as:

* &quot;c&quot;.1130–&quot;c&quot;.1240 &quot;Early&quot; to &quot;High Gothic&quot; and &quot;Early English&quot;
* &quot;c&quot;.1240–&quot;c&quot;.1350 &quot;Rayonnant&quot; and &quot;Decorated Style&quot;
* &quot;c&quot;.1350–&quot;c&quot;.1500 &quot;Late Gothic&quot;: &quot;flamboyant&quot; and &quot;perpendicular&quot;
* &quot;c&quot;.16th–18th century &quot;Post-Gothic&quot;

== History ==
=== Early Gothic ===
Norman architecture on either side of the English Channel developed in parallel towards &quot;Early Gothic&quot;. Gothic features, such as the rib vault, had appeared in England, Sicily and Normandy in the 11th century. Rib-vaults were employed in some parts of the cathedral at Durham (1093–) and in Lessay Abbey in Normandy (1098). However, the first buildings to be considered fully Gothic are the royal funerary abbey of the French kings, the Abbey of Saint-Denis (1135–1144), and the archiepiscopal cathedral at Sens (1135–1164). They were the first buildings to systematically combine rib vaulting, buttresses, and pointed arches. Most of the characteristics of later &quot;Early English&quot; were already present in the lower &quot;chevet&quot; of Saint-Denis.

The Duchy of Normandy, part of the Angevin Empire until the 13th century, developed its own version of Gothic. One of these was the Norman chevet, a small apse or chapel attached to the choir at the east end of the church, which typically had a half-dome. The lantern tower was another common feature in Norman Gothic. One example of early Norman Gothic is Bayeux Cathedral (1060–1070) where the Romanesque cathedral nave and choir were rebuilt into the Gothic style. Lisieux Cathedral was begun in 1170. Rouen Cathedral (begun 1185) was rebuilt from Romanesque to Gothic with distinct Norman features, including a lantern tower, deeply moulded decoration, and high pointed arcades. Coutances Cathedral was remade into Gothic beginning about 1220. Its most distinctive feature is the octagonal lantern on the crossing of the transept, decorated with ornamental ribs, and surrounded by sixteen bays and sixteen lancet windows.

Saint-Denis was the work of the Abbot Suger, a close adviser of Kings Louis VI and Louis VII. Suger reconstructed portions of the old Romanesque church with the rib vault in order to remove walls and to make more space for windows. He described the new ambulatory as &quot;a circular ring of chapels, by virtue of which the whole church would shine with the wonderful and uninterrupted light of most luminous windows, pervading the interior beauty.&quot; To support the vaults he also introduced columns with capitals of carved vegetal designs, modelled upon the classical columns he had seen in Rome. In addition, he installed a circular rose window over the portal on the façade. These also became a common feature of Gothic cathedrals.

Some elements of Gothic style appeared very early in England. Durham Cathedral was the first cathedral to employ a rib vault, built between 1093 and 1104. The first cathedral built entirely in the new style was Sens Cathedral, begun between 1135 and 1140 and consecrated in 1160. Sens Cathedral features a Gothic choir, and six-part rib vaults over the nave and collateral aisles, alternating pillars and doubled columns to support the vaults, and buttresses to offset the outward thrust from the vaults. One of the builders who is believed to have worked on Sens Cathedral, William of Sens, later travelled to England and became the architect who, between 1175 and 1180, reconstructed the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in the new Gothic style.

Sens Cathedral was influential in its strongly vertical appearance and in its three-part elevation, typical of subsequent Gothic buildings, with a clerestory at the top supported by a triforium, all carried on high arcades of pointed arches. In the following decades flying buttresses began to be used, allowing the construction of lighter, higher walls. French Gothic churches were heavily influenced both by the ambulatory and side-chapels around the choir at Saint-Denis, and by the paired towers and triple doors on the western façade.

Sens was quickly followed by Senlis Cathedral (begun 1160), and Notre-Dame de Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements from Saint-Denis. The builders of Notre-Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the upper walls. The buttresses counterbalanced the outward thrust from the rib vaults. This allowed the builders to construct higher, thinner walls and larger windows.
===&quot;Early English&quot; and &quot;High Gothic&quot;===
Following the destruction by fire of the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1174, a group of master builders was invited to propose plans for the reconstruction. The master-builder William of Sens, who had worked on Sens Cathedral, won the competition. Work began that same year, but in 1178 William was badly injured by falling from the scaffolding, and returned to France, where he died. His work was continued by William the Englishman who replaced his French namesake in 1178. The resulting structure of the choir of Canterbury Cathedral is considered the first work of &quot;Early English Gothic&quot;. The cathedral churches of Worcester (1175–), Wells (&quot;c&quot;.1180–), Lincoln (1192–), and Salisbury (1220–) are all, with Canterbury, major examples. &quot;Tiercerons&quot; – decorative vaulting ribs – seem first to have been used in vaulting at Lincoln Cathedral, installed &quot;c&quot;.1200. Instead of a triforium, &quot;Early English&quot; churches usually retained a gallery.

High Gothic (–1250) was a brief but very productive period, which produced some of the great landmarks of Gothic art. The first building in the High Gothic () was Chartres Cathedral, an important pilgrimage church south of Paris. The Romanesque cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1194, but was swiftly rebuilt in the new style, with contributions from King Philip II of France, Pope Celestine III, local gentry, merchants, craftsmen, and Richard the Lionheart, king of England. The builders simplified the elevation used at Notre Dame, eliminated the tribune galleries, and used flying buttresses to support the upper walls. The walls were filled with stained glass, mainly depicting the story of the Virgin Mary but also, in a small corner of each window, illustrating the crafts of the guilds who donated those windows.

The model of Chartres was followed by a series of new cathedrals of unprecedented height and size. These were Reims Cathedral (begun 1211), where coronations of the kings of France took place; Amiens Cathedral (1220–1226); Bourges Cathedral (1195–1230) (which, unlike the others, continued to use six-part rib vaults); and Beauvais Cathedral (1225–).

In central Europe, the High Gothic style appeared in the Holy Roman Empire, first at Toul (1220–), whose Romanesque cathedral was rebuilt in the style of Reims Cathedral; then Trier&#x27;s Liebfrauenkirche parish church (1228–), and then throughout the &quot;Reich&quot;, beginning with the Elisabethkirche at Marburg (1235–) and the cathedral at Metz (&quot;c&quot;.1235–).

In High Gothic, the whole surface of the clerestory was given over to windows. At Chartres Cathedral, plate tracery was used for the rose window, but at Reims the bar-tracery was free-standing. Lancet windows were supplanted by multiple lights separated by &quot;geometrical&quot; bar-tracery. Tracery of this kind distinguishes &quot;Middle Pointed&quot; style from the simpler &quot;First Pointed&quot;. Inside, the nave was divided into by regular bays, each covered by a quadripartite rib vaults.

Other characteristics of the High Gothic were the development of rose windows of greater size, using bar-tracery, higher and longer flying buttresses, which could reach up to the highest windows, and walls of sculpture illustrating biblical stories filling the façade and the fronts of the transept. Reims Cathedral had two thousand three hundred statues on the front and back side of the façade.

The new High Gothic churches competed to be the tallest, with increasingly ambitious structures lifting the vault yet higher. Chartres Cathedral&#x27;s height of was exceeded by Beauvais Cathedral&#x27;s , but on account of the latter&#x27;s collapse in 1248, no further attempt was made to build higher. Attention turned from achieving greater height to creating more awe-inspiring decoration.

=== &quot;Rayonnant Gothic&quot; and &quot;Decorated Style&quot; ===

&quot;Rayonnant Gothic&quot; maximized the coverage of stained glass windows such that the walls are effectively entirely glazed; examples are the nave of Saint-Denis (1231–) and the royal chapel of Louis IX of France on the Île de la Cité in the Seine – the Sainte-Chapelle (&quot;c&quot;.1241–1248). The high and thin walls of French &quot;Rayonnant Gothic&quot; allowed by the flying buttresses enabled increasingly ambitious expanses of glass and decorated tracery, reinforced with ironwork. Shortly after Saint-Denis, in the 1250s, Louis IX commissioned the rebuilt transepts and enormous rose windows of Notre-Dame de Paris (1250s for the north transept, 1258 for the beginning of south transept). This first &#x27;international style&#x27; was also used in the clerestory of Metz Cathedral (&quot;c&quot;. 1245–), then in the choir of Cologne&#x27;s cathedral (&quot;c&quot;. 1250–), and again in the nave of the cathedral at Strasbourg (&quot;c&quot;. 1250–). Masons elaborated a series of tracery patterns for windows – from the basic &quot;geometrical&quot; to the &quot;reticulated&quot; and the &quot;curvilinear –&quot; which had superseded the lancet window. Bar-tracery of the &quot;curvilinear, flowing&quot;, and &quot;reticulated&quot; types distinguish &quot;Second Pointed&quot; style.

&quot;Decorated Gothic&quot; similarly sought to emphasize the windows, but excelled in the ornamentation of their tracery. Churches with features of this style include Westminster Abbey (1245–), the cathedrals at Lichfield (after 1257–) and Exeter (1275–), Bath Abbey (1298–), and the retro choir at Wells Cathedral (&quot;c&quot;.1320–).

The &quot;Rayonnant&quot; developed its second &#x27;international style&#x27; with increasingly autonomous and sharp-edged tracery mouldings apparent in the cathedral at Clermont-Ferrand (1248–), the papal collegiate church at Troyes, Saint-Urbain (1262–), and the west façade of Strasbourg Cathedral (1276–1439)). By 1300, there were examples influenced by Strasbourg in the cathedrals of Limoges (1273–), Regensburg (&quot;c&quot;. 1275–), and in the cathedral nave at York (1292–).
=== &quot;Late Gothic&quot;: &quot;flamboyant&quot; and &quot;perpendicular&quot; ===

Central Europe began to lead the emergence of a new, international &quot;flamboyant&quot; style with the construction of a new cathedral at Prague (1344–) under the direction of Peter Parler. This model of rich and variegated tracery and intricate reticulated rib-vaulting was definitive in the &quot;Late Gothic&quot; of continental Europe, emulated not only by the collegiate churches and cathedrals, but by urban parish churches which rivalled them in size and magnificence. The minster at Ulm and other parish churches like the Heilig-Kreuz-Münster at Schwäbisch Gmünd (&quot;c&quot;.1320–), St Barbara&#x27;s Church at Kutná Hora (1389–), and the Heilig-Geist-Kirche (1407–) and St Martin&#x27;s Church (&quot;c&quot;.1385–) in Landshut are typical. Use of ogees was especially common.
The &quot;flamboyant&quot; style was characterised by the multiplication of the ribs of the vaults, with new purely decorative ribs, called tiercons and liernes, and additional diagonal ribs. One common ornament of &quot;flamboyant&quot; in France is the &quot;arc-en-accolade&quot;, an arch over a window topped by a pinnacle, which was itself topped with fleuron, and flanked by other pinnacles. Examples of French &quot;flamboyant&quot; building include the west façade of Rouen Cathedral, and especially the façades of Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes (1370s) and choir Mont-Saint-Michel&#x27;s abbey church (1448).

In England, ornamental rib-vaulting and tracery of &quot;Decorated Gothic&quot; co-existed with, and then gave way to, the &quot;perpendicular&quot; style from the 1320s, with straightened, orthogonal tracery topped with fan-vaulting. &quot;Perpendicular&quot; &quot;Gothic&quot; was unknown in continental Europe and unlike earlier styles had no equivalent in Scotland or Ireland. It first appeared in the cloisters and chapter-house () of Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London by William de Ramsey. The chancel of Gloucester Cathedral (1357) and its latter 14th century cloisters are early examples. Four-centred arches were often used, and lierne vaults seen in early buildings were developed into fan vaults, first at the latter 14th century chapter-house of Hereford Cathedral (demolished 1769) and cloisters at Gloucester, and then at Reginald Ely&#x27;s King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge (14461461) and the brothers William and Robert Vertue&#x27;s Henry VII Chapel (1512) at Westminster Abbey. &quot;Perpendicular&quot; is sometimes called &quot;Third Pointed&quot; and was employed over three centuries; the fan-vaulted staircase at Christ Church, Oxford built around 1640.

Lacey patterns of tracery continued to characterize continental Gothic building, with very elaborate and articulated vaulting, as at Saint Barbara&#x27;s, Kutná Hora (1512). In certain areas, Gothic architecture continued to be employed until the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in provincial and ecclesiastical contexts, notably at Oxford.

=== Decline and transition ===

Beginning in the mid-15th century, the Gothic style gradually lost its dominance in Europe. It had never been popular in Italy, and in the mid-15th century the Italians, drawing upon ancient Roman ruins, returned to classical models. The dome of Florence Cathedral (1420–1436) by Filippo Brunelleschi, inspired by the Pantheon, Rome, was one of the first Renaissance landmarks, but it also employed Gothic technology; the outer skin of the dome was supported by a framework of twenty-four ribs. In the 16th century, as Renaissance architecture from Italy began to appear in France and other countries in Europe. The Gothic style began to be described as outdated, ugly and even barbaric. The term &quot;Gothic&quot; was first used as a pejorative description. Giorgio Vasari used the term &quot;barbarous German style&quot; in his 1550 &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot; to describe what is now considered the Gothic style. In the introduction to the &quot;Lives&quot; he attributed various architectural features to the Goths whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered Rome, and erecting new ones in this style. In the 17th century, Molière also mocked the Gothic style in the 1669 poem &quot;La Gloire&quot;: &quot;...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...&quot; The dominant styles in Europe became in turn Italian Renaissance architecture, Baroque architecture, and the grand classicism of the &quot;style Louis XIV&quot;.

The Kings of France had first-hand knowledge of the new Italian style, because of the military campaign of Charles VIII to Naples and Milan (1494), and especially the campaigns of Louis XII and Francis I (1500–1505) to restore French control over Milan and Genoa. They brought back Italian paintings, sculpture and building plans, and, more importantly, Italian craftsmen and artists. The Cardinal Georges d&#x27;Amboise, chief minister of Louis XII, built the Chateau of Gaillon near Rouen (1502–1510) with the assistance of Italian craftsmen. The Château de Blois (1515–1524) introduced the Renaissance loggia and open stairway. King Francois I installed Leonardo da Vinci at his Chateau of Chambord in 1516, and introduced a Renaissance long gallery at the Palace of Fontainebleau in 1528–1540. In 1546 Francois I began building the first example of French classicism, the square courtyard of the Louvre Palace designed by Pierre Lescot.

Nonetheless, new Gothic buildings, particularly churches, continued to be built. New Gothic churches built in Paris in this period included Saint-Merri (1520–1552) and Saint-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois. The first signs of classicism in Paris churches did not appear until 1540, at Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais. The largest new church, Saint-Eustache (1532–1560), rivalled Notre-Dame in size, long, wide, and high. As construction of this church continued, elements of Renaissance decoration, including the system of classical orders of columns, were added to the design, making it a Gothic-Renaissance hybrid.

In Germany, some Italian elements were introduced at the Fugger Chapel of St. Anne&#x27;s Church, Augsburg, (1510–1512) combined with Gothic vaults; and others appeared in the Church of St. Michael in Munich, but in Germany Renaissance elements were used primarily for decoration. Some Renaissance elements also appeared in Spain, in the new palace begun by Emperor Charles V in Granada, within the Alhambra (1485–1550), inspired by Bramante and Raphael, but it was never completed. The first major Renaissance work in Spain was El Escorial, the monastery-palace built by Philip II of Spain.

Under Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, England was largely isolated from architectural developments on the continent. The first classical building in England was the Old Somerset House in London (1547–1552) (since demolished), built by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, who was regent as Lord Protector for Edward VI until the young king came of age in 1547. Somerset&#x27;s successor, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, sent the architectural scholar John Shute to Italy to study the style. Shute published the first book in English on classical architecture in 1570. The first English houses in the new style were Burghley House (1550s–1580s) and Longleat, built by associates of Somerset. With those buildings, a new age of architecture began in England.

Gothic architecture, usually churches or university buildings, continued to be built. Ireland was an island of Gothic architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries, with the construction of Derry Cathedral (completed 1633), Sligo Cathedral (), and Down Cathedral (1790–1818) are other examples. In the 17th and 18th century several important Gothic buildings were constructed at Oxford University and Cambridge University, including Tom Tower (1681–82) at Christ Church, Oxford, by Christopher Wren. It also appeared, in a whimsical fashion, in Horace Walpole&#x27;s Twickenham villa, Strawberry Hill (1749–1776). The two western towers of Westminster Abbey were constructed between 1722 and 1745 by Nicholas Hawksmoor, opening a new period of Gothic Revival.

Gothic architecture survived the early modern period and flourished again in a revival from the late 18th century and throughout the 19th. &quot;Perpendicular&quot; was the first Gothic style revived in the 18th century.

==Survival, rediscovery and revival==

In England, partly in response to a philosophy propounded by the Oxford Movement and others associated with the emerging revival of &#x27;high church&#x27; or Anglo-Catholic ideas during the second quarter of the 19th century, neo-Gothic began to become promoted by influential establishment figures as the preferred style for ecclesiastical, civic and institutional architecture. The appeal of this Gothic revival (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed Victorian Gothic), gradually widened to encompass &quot;low church&quot; as well as &quot;high church&quot; clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855–1885, is known in Britain as High Victorian Gothic.

The Palace of Westminster in London by Sir Charles Barry with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, Augustus Welby Pugin, is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the &quot;High Victorian Gothic&quot; period include George Gilbert Scott&#x27;s design for the Albert Memorial in London, and William Butterfield&#x27;s chapel at Keble College, Oxford. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.

The middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of Cologne Cathedral and the Sainte-Clotilde of Paris as speculation of mediaeval architecture turned to technical consideration. London&#x27;s Palace of Westminster, St Pancras railway station, New York&#x27;s Trinity Church and St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral are also famous examples of Gothic Revival buildings. The style also reached the Far East in the period, for instance the Anglican St John&#x27;s Cathedral located at the centre of Victoria City in Central, Hong Kong.

==Structural elements==
===Pointed arches===
The defining characteristic of the Gothic style is the pointed arch, which was widely used in both structure and decoration. The pointed arch did not originate in Gothic architecture; they had been employed for centuries in the Near East in pre-Islamic as well as Islamic architecture for arches, arcades, and ribbed vaults. In Gothic architecture, particularly in the later Gothic styles, they became the most visible and characteristic element, giving a sensation of verticality and pointing upward, like the spires. Gothic rib vaults covered the nave, and pointed arches were commonly used for the arcades, windows, doorways, in the tracery, and especially in the later Gothic styles decorating the façades. They were also sometimes used for more practical purposes, such as to bring transverse vaults to the same height as diagonal vaults, as in the nave and aisles of Durham Cathedral, built in 1093.

The earliest Gothic pointed arches were lancet lights or lancet windows, which are narrow windows terminating in a lancet arch. A lancet arch has a radius longer than their breadth (width) and resembles the blade of a lancet. In the 12th-century &quot;First Pointed&quot; phase of Gothic architecture (also called the &quot;Lancet style&quot;) and before the introduction of tracery in the windows in later styles, lancet windows predominated Gothic building.

The Flamboyant style of Gothic architecture is particularly known for lavish pointed details such as the &quot;arc-en-accolade&quot;, where a pointed arch over a doorway was topped by a pointed sculptural ornament called a fleuron and by pointed pinnacles on either side. The arches of the doorway were further decorated with small cabbage-shaped sculptures called &quot;chou-frisés&quot;.

===Rib vaults===
The Gothic rib vault was one of the essential elements that made the great height and large windows of Gothic architecture possible. Unlike the semi-circular barrel vault of Roman and Romanesque buildings, where the weight pressed directly downward, and required thick walls and small windows, the Gothic rib vault was made of diagonal crossing arched ribs. These ribs directed the thrust outwards to the corners of the vault, and downwards via slender colonnettes and bundled columns, to the pillars and columns below. The space between the ribs was filled with thin panels of small pieces of stone, which were much lighter than earlier groin vaults. The outward thrust against the walls was countered by the weight of buttresses and later flying buttresses. As a result, the massive, thick walls of Romanesque buildings were no longer needed, as since the vaults were supported by columns and piers, the walls could be made thinner and higher, and filled with windows.

The earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Sens Cathedral (begun between 1135 and 1140) and Notre-Dame de Paris (begun 1163), were divided by the ribs into six compartments. They were very difficult to build and could only cross a limited space. Since each vault covered two bays, they needed support on the ground floor from alternating columns and piers. In later construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults were divided into only four compartments. The alternating rows of alternating columns and piers receiving the vaults&#x27; weight were replaced by simple pillars, each receiving the same weight. A single vault could cross the nave. This method was used at Chartres Cathedral (1194–1220), Amiens Cathedral (begun 1220), and Reims Cathedral. The four-part vaults made it possible for taller buildings to be constructed. Notre-Dame, which had begun with six-part vaults, reached a height of . Amiens Cathedral, which had begun with the newer four-part ribs, reached a height of at the transept.


=== Later vaults (13th–15th century) ===
In France, the four-part rib vault, with two diagonals crossing at the center of the traverse, was the type used almost exclusively until the end of the Gothic period. However, in England, several imaginative new vaults were invented which had more elaborate decorative features. They became a signature of the later English Gothic styles.

The first of these new vaults had an additional rib, called a tierceron, which ran down the median of the vault. It first appeared in the vaults of the choir of Lincoln Cathedral at the end of the 12th century, then at Worcester Cathedral in 1224, and then the south transept of Lichfield Cathedral.

The 14th century brought the invention of several new types of vaults which were more and more decorative. These vaults often copied the forms form of the elaborate tracery of the Late Gothic styles. These included the stellar vault, where a group of additional ribs between the principal ribs forms a star design. The oldest vaults of this kind were found in the crypt of Saint Stephen at Westminster Palace, built about 1320. A second type was called a reticulated vault, which had a network of additional decorative ribs, in triangles and other geometric forms, placed between or over the traverse ribs. These were first used in the choir of Bristol Cathedral in about 1311. Another late Gothic form, the fan vault, with ribs spreading upwards and outwards, appeared later in the 14th century. An example is the cloister of Gloucester Cathedral ().

Another new form was the skeleton vault, which appeared in the English Decorated style. It has an additional network of ribs, like the ribs of an umbrella, which criss-cross the vault but are only directly attached to it at certain points. It appeared in a chapel of Lincoln Cathedral in 1300. and then several other English churches. This style of vault was adopted in the 14th century in particular by German architects, particularly Peter Parler, and in other parts of central Europe. Another exists in the south porch of the Prague Cathedral

Elaborate vaults also appeared in civic architecture. An example is the ceiling of the Vladislav Hall in Prague Castle in Bohemia designed by Benedikt Ried in 1493. The ribs twist and intertwine in fantasy patterns, which later critics called &quot;Rococo Gothic&quot;.

===Columns and piers===

In early French Gothic architecture, the capitals of the columns were modeled after Roman columns of the Corinthian order, with finely-sculpted leaves. They were used in the ambulatory of the Abbey church of Saint-Denis. According to its builder, the Abbot Suger, they were inspired by the columns he had seen in the ancient baths in Rome. They were used later at Sens, at Notre-Dame de Paris and at Canterbury in England.

In early Gothic churches with six-part rib vaults, the columns in the nave alternated with more massive piers to provide support for the vaults. With the introduction of the four-part rib vault, all of the piers or columns in the nave could have the same design. In the High Gothic period, a new form was introduced, composed of a central core surrounded several attached slender columns, or colonettes, going up to the vaults. These clustered columns were used at Chartres, Amiens, Reims and Bourges, Westminster Abbey and Salisbury Cathedral. Another variation was a quadrilobe column, shaped like a clover, formed of four attached columns. In England, the clustered columns were often ornamented with stone rings, as well as columns with carved leaves.

Later styles added further variations. Sometimes the piers were rectangular and fluted, as at Seville Cathedral, In England, parts of columns sometimes had contrasting colours, using combining white stone with dark Purbeck marble. In place of the Corinthian capital, some columns used a stiff-leaf design. In later Gothic, the piers became much taller, reaching up more than half of the nave. Another variation, particularly popular in eastern France, was a column without a capital, which continued upward without capitals or other interruption, all the way to the vaults, giving a dramatic display of verticality.

===Flying buttresses===

An important feature of Gothic architecture was the flying buttress, a half-arch outside the building which carried the thrust of weight of the roof or vaults inside over a roof or an aisle to a heavy stone column. The buttresses were placed in rows on either side of the building, and were often topped by heavy stone pinnacles, both to give extra weight and for additional decoration.

Buttresses had existed since Roman times, usually set directly against the building, but the Gothic vaults were more sophisticated. In later structures, the buttresses often had several arches, each reaching in to a different level of the structure. The buttresses permitted the buildings to be both taller, and to have thinner walls, with greater space for windows.

Over time, the buttresses and pinnacles became more elaborate supporting statues and other decoration, as at Beauvais Cathedral and Reims Cathedral. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone gargoyles placed in rows on the buttresses.

Flying buttresses were used less frequently in England, where the emphasis was more on length than height. One example of English buttresses was Canterbury Cathedral, whose choir and buttresses were rebuilt in Gothic style by William of Sens and William the Englishman. However, they were very popular in Germany: in Cologne Cathedral the buttresses were lavishly decorated with statuary and other ornament, and were a prominent feature of the exterior.

=== Towers and spires ===
Towers, spires and flèches were an important feature of Gothic churches. They presented a dramatic spectacle of great height, helped make their churches the tallest and most visible buildings in their city, and symbolised the aspirations of their builders toward heaven. They also had a practical purpose; they often served as bell towers supporting belfries, whose bells told the time by announcing religious services, warned of fire or enemy attack, and celebrated special occasions like military victories and coronations. Sometimes the bell tower is built separate from a church; the best-known example of this is the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

The towers of cathedrals were usually the last part of the structure to be built. Since cathedral construction usually took many years, and was extremely expensive, by the time the tower were to be built public enthusiasm waned, and tastes changed. Many projected towers were never built, or were built in different styles than other parts of the cathedral, or with different styles on each level of the tower. At Chartres Cathedral, the south tower was built in the 12th century, in the simpler Early Gothic, while the north tower is the more highly decorated Flamboyant style. Chartres would have been even more exuberant if the second plan had been followed; it called for seven towers around the transept and sanctuary.

In the Île-de-France, cathedral towers followed the Romanesque tradition of two identical towers, one on either side of the portals. The west front of the Saint-Denis, became the model for the early Gothic cathedrals and High Gothic cathedrals in northern France, including Notre-Dame de Paris, Reims Cathedral, and Amiens Cathedral.

The early and High Gothic Laon Cathedral has a square lantern tower over the crossing of the transept; two towers on the western front; and two towers on the ends of the transepts. Laon&#x27;s towers, with the exception of the central tower, are built with two stacked vaulted chambers pierced by lancet openings. The two western towers contain life-size stone statues of sixteen oxen in their upper arcades, said to honour the animals who hauled the stone during the cathedral&#x27;s construction.

In Normandy, cathedrals and major churches often had multiple towers, built over the centuries; the Abbaye aux Hommes (begun 1066), Caen has nine towers and spires, placed on the façade, the transepts, and the centre. A lantern tower was often placed the centre of the nave, at the meeting point with the transept, to give light to the church below.

In later periods of Gothic, pointed needle-like spires were often added to the towers, giving them much greater height. A variation of the spire was the flèche, a slender, spear-like spire, which was usually placed on the transept where it crossed the nave. They were often made of wood covered with lead or other metal. They sometimes had open frames, and were decorated with sculpture. Amiens Cathedral has a flèche. The most famous example was that of Notre-Dame de Paris. The original flèche of Notre-Dame was built on the crossing of the transept in the middle of the 13th century, and housed five bells. It was removed in 1786 during a program to modernize the cathedral, but was put back in a new form designed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. The new flèche, of wood covered with lead, was decorated with statues of the Apostles; the figure of St Thomas resembled Viollet-le-Duc. The flèche was destroyed in the 2019 fire, but is being restored in the same design.

In English Gothic, the major tower was often placed at the crossing of the transept and nave, and was much higher than the other. The most famous example is the tower of Salisbury Cathedral, completed in 1320 by William of Farleigh. It was a remarkable feat of construction, since it was built upon the pillars of the much earlier church. A crossing tower was constructed at Canterbury Cathedral in 1493–1501 by John Wastell, who had previously worked on King&#x27;s College at Cambridge. It was finished by Henry Yevele, who also built the present nave of Canterbury. The new central tower at Wells Cathedral caused a problem; it was too heavy for the original structure. An unusual double arch had to be constructed in the centre of the crossing to give the tower the extra support it needed.

England&#x27;s Gothic parish churches and collegiate churches generally have a single western tower. A number of the finest churches have masonry spires, with those of St James Church, Louth; St Wulfram&#x27;s Church, Grantham; St Mary Redcliffe in Bristol; and Coventry Cathedral. These spires all exceed in height.

Westminster Abbey&#x27;s crossing tower has for centuries remained unbuilt, and numerous architects have proposed various ways of completing it since the 1250s, when work began on the tower under Henry III. A century and half later, an octagonal roof lantern resembling that of Ely Cathedral was installed instead, which was then demolished in the 16th century. Construction began again in 1724 to the design of Nicholas Hawksmoor, after first Christopher Wren had proposed a design in 1710, but stopped again in 1727. The crossing remains covered by the stub of the lantern and a &#x27;temporary&#x27; roof.

Later Gothic towers in Central Europe often followed the French model, but added even denser decorative tracery. Cologne Cathedral had been started in the 13th century, following the plan of Amiens Cathedral, but only the apse and the base of one tower were finished in the Gothic period. The original plans were conserved and rediscovered in 1817, and the building was completed in the 19th century following the origin design. It has two spectacularly ornamented towers, covered with arches, gables, pinnacles and openwork spires pointing upwards. The tower of Ulm Minster has a similar history, begun in 1377, stopped in 1543, and not completed until the 19th century.

Regional variants of Gothic towers appeared in Spain and Italy. Burgos Cathedral was inspired by Northern Europe. It has an exceptional cluster of openwork spires, towers, and pinnacles, drenched with ornament. It was begun in 1444 by a German architect, Juan de Colonia (John of Cologne) and eventually completed by a central tower (1540) built by his grandson.

In Italy the towers were sometimes separate from the cathedral; and the architects usually kept their distance from the Northern European style. the leaning tower of Pisa Cathedral, built between 1173 and 1372, is the best-known example. The Campanile of Florence Cathedral was built by Giotto in the Florentine Gothic style, decorated with encrustations of polychrome marble. It was originally designed to have a spire.

=== Tracery ===
Tracery is an architectural solution by which windows (or screens, panels, and vaults) are divided into sections of various proportions by stone &quot;bars&quot; or &quot;ribs&quot; of moulding. Pointed arch windows of Gothic buildings were initially (late 12th–late 13th centuries) lancet windows, a solution typical of the &quot;Early Gothic&quot; or &quot;First Pointed&quot; style and of the &quot;Early English&quot; Gothic. Plate tracery was the first type of tracery to be developed, emerging in the later phase of &quot;Early Gothic&quot; or &quot;First Pointed&quot;. &quot;Second Pointed&quot; is distinguished from &quot;First&quot; by the appearance of &quot;bar–tracery&quot;, allowing the construction of much larger window openings, and the development of &quot;Curvilinear&quot;, &quot;Flowing&quot;, and &quot;Reticulated&quot; tracery, ultimately contributing to the &quot;Flamboyant&quot; style. &quot;Late Gothic&quot; in most of Europe saw tracery patterns resembling lace develop, while in England &quot;Perpendicular Gothic&quot; or &quot;Third Pointed&quot; preferred plainer vertical mullions and transoms. Tracery is practical as well as decorative, because the increasingly large windows of Gothic buildings needed maximum support against the wind.

Plate tracery, in which lights were pierced in a thin wall of ashlar, allowed a window arch to have more than one light – typically two side by side and separated by flat stone spandrels. The spandrels were then sculpted into figures like a roundel or a quatrefoil. Plate tracery reached the height of its sophistication with the 12th century windows of Chartres Cathedral and in the &quot;Dean&#x27;s Eye&quot; rose window at Lincoln Cathedral.

At the beginning of the 13th century, plate tracery was superseded by bar-tracery. Bar-tracery divides the large lights from one another with moulded mullions. Stone bar-tracery, an important decorative element of Gothic styles, first was used at Reims Cathedral shortly after 1211, in the chevet built by Jean D&#x27;Orbais. It was employed in England around 1240. After 1220, master builders in England had begun to treat the window openings as a series of openings divided by thin stone bars, while before 1230 the apse chapels of Reims Cathedral were decorated with bar-tracery with cusped circles (with bars radiating from the centre). Bar-tracery became common after , with increasing complexity and decreasing weight. The lines of the mullions continued beyond the tops of the window lights and subdivided the open spandrels above the lights into a variety of decorative shapes. &quot;Rayonnant&quot; style () was enabled by the development of bar-tracery in Continental Europe and is named for the radiation of lights around a central point in circular rose windows. &quot;Rayonnant&quot; also deployed mouldings of two different types in tracery, where earlier styles had used moulding of a single size, with different sizes of mullions. The rose windows of Notre-Dame de Paris (c.1270) are typical.
The early phase of &quot;Middle Pointed&quot; style (late 13th century) is characterized by &quot;Geometrical&quot; tracery – simple bar-tracery forming patterns of foiled arches and circles interspersed with triangular lights. The mullions of &quot;Geometrical&quot; style typically had capitals with curved bars emerging from them. &quot;Intersecting&quot; bar-tracery (c.1300) deployed mullions without capitals which branched off equidistant to the window-head. The window-heads themselves were formed of equal curves forming a pointed arch and the tracery-bars were curved by drawing curves with differing radii from the same centres as the window-heads. The mullions were in consequence branched into Y-shaped designs further ornamented with cusps. The intersecting branches produced an array of lozenge-shaped lights in between numerous lancet arched lights.&quot;Y-tracery&quot; was often employed in two-light windows c.1300.

&quot;Second Pointed&quot; (14th century) saw &quot;Intersecting&quot; tracery elaborated with ogees, creating a complex reticular (net-like) design known as &quot;Reticulated&quot; tracery. &quot;Second Pointed&quot; architecture deployed tracery in highly decorated fashion known as &quot;Curvilinear&quot; and &quot;Flowing&quot; (&quot;Undulating&quot;). These types of bar-tracery were developed further throughout Europe in the 15th century into the &quot;Flamboyant&quot; style, named for the characteristic flame-shaped spaces between the tracery-bars. These shapes are known as &quot;daggers&quot;, &quot;fish-bladders&quot;, or &quot;mouchettes&quot;.

&quot;Third Pointed&quot; or &quot;Perpendicular Gothic&quot; developed in England from the later 14th century and is typified by &quot;Rectilinear&quot; tracery (&quot;panel&quot;-tracery). The mullions are often joined together by transoms and continue up their straight vertical lines to the top of the window&#x27;s main arch, some branching off into lesser arches, and creating a series of panel-like lights. &quot;Perpendicular&quot; strove for verticality and dispensed with the &quot;Curvilinear&quot; style&#x27;s sinuous lines in favour of unbroken straight mullions from top to bottom, transected by horizontal transoms and bars. Four-centred arches were used in the 15th and 16th centuries to create windows of increasing size with flatter window-heads, often filling the entire wall of the bay between each buttress. The windows were themselves divided into panels of lights topped by pointed arches struck from four centres. The transoms were often topped by miniature crenellations. The windows at Cambridge of King&#x27;s College Chapel (1446–1515) represent the heights of &quot;Perpendicular&quot; tracery.

Tracery was used on both the interior and exterior of buildings. It frequently covered the façades, and the interior walls of the nave and choir were covered with blind arcades. It also often picked up and repeated the designs in the stained glass windows. Strasbourg Cathedral has a west front lavishly ornamented with bar tracery matching the windows.

==Plans==

The plan of Gothic cathedrals and churches was usually based on the Latin cross (or &quot;cruciform&quot;) plan, taken from the ancient Roman Basilica, and from the later Romanesque churches. They have a long nave making the body of the church, where the parishioners worshipped; a transverse arm called the transept and, beyond it to the east, the choir, also known as a chancel or presbytery, that was usually reserved for the clergy. The eastern end of the church was rounded in French churches, and was occupied by several radiating chapels, which allowed multiple ceremonies to go on simultaneously. In English churches the eastern end also had chapels, but was usually rectangular. A passage called the ambulatory circled the choir. This allowed parishioners, and especially pilgrims, to walk past the chapels to see the relics displayed there without disturbing other services going on.

Each vault of the nave formed a separate cell, with its own supporting piers or columns. The early cathedrals, like Notre-Dame, had six-part rib vaults, with alternating columns and piers, while later cathedrals had the simpler and stronger four-part vaults, with identical columns.

Following the model of Romanesque architecture and the Basilica of Saint Denis, cathedrals usually had two towers flanking the west façade. Towers over the crossing were common in England (Salisbury Cathedral), York Minister) but rarer in France.

Transepts were usually short in early French Gothic architecture, but became longer and were given large rose windows in the Rayonnant period. The choirs became more important. The choir was often flanked by a double disambulatory, which was crowned by a ring of small chapels. In England, transepts were more important, and the floor plans were usually much more complex than in French cathedrals, with the addition of attached Lady Chapels, an octagonal Chapter House, and other structures (See plans of Salisbury Cathedral and York Minster below). This reflected a tendency in France to carry out multiple functions in the same space, while English cathedrals compartmentalized them. This contrast is visible in the difference between Amiens Cathedral, with its minimal transepts and semicircular apse, filled with chapels, on the east end, compared with the double transepts, projecting north porch, and rectangular east end of Salisbury and York.

==Elevations and the search for height==
Gothic architecture was a continual search for greater height, thinner walls, and more light. This was clearly illustrated in the evolving elevations of the cathedrals.

In Early Gothic architecture, following the model of the Romanesque churches, the buildings had thick, solid walls with a minimum of windows in order to give enough support for the vaulted roofs. An elevation typically had four levels. On the ground floor was an arcade with massive piers alternating with thinner columns, which supported the six-part rib vaults. Above that was a gallery, called the tribune, which provided stability to the walls, and was sometimes used to provide seating for the nuns. Above that was a narrower gallery, called the triforium, which also helped provide additional thickness and support. At the top, just beneath the vaults, was the clerestory, where the high windows were placed. The upper level was supported from the outside by the flying buttresses. This system was used at Noyon Cathedral, Sens Cathedral, and other early structures.

In the High Gothic period, thanks to the introduction of the four part rib vault, a simplified elevation appeared at Chartres Cathedral and others. The alternating piers and columns on the ground floor were replaced by rows of identical circular piers wrapped in four engaged columns. The tribune disappeared, which meant that the arcades could be higher. This created more space at the top for the upper windows, which were expanded to include a smaller circular window above a group of lancet windows. The new walls gave a stronger sense of verticality and brought in more light. A similar arrangement was adapted in England, at Salisbury Cathedral, Lincoln Cathedral, and Ely Cathedral.

An important characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, clerestory) was transformed in the choir of Beauvais Cathedral to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.

Beauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures. Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.

== West front ==

Churches traditionally face east, with the altar at the east, and the west front, or façade, was considered the most important entrance. Gothic façades were adapted from the model of the Romanesque façades. The façades usually had three portals, or doorways, leading into the nave. Over each doorway was a tympanum, a work of sculpture crowded with figures. The sculpture of the central tympanum was devoted to the Last Judgement, that to the left to the Virgin Mary, and that to the right to the Saints honoured at that particular cathedral. In the early Gothic, the columns of the doorways took the form of statues of saints, making them literally &quot;pillars of the church&quot;.

In the early Gothic, the façades were characterized by height, elegance, harmony, unity, and a balance of proportions. They followed the doctrine expressed by Saint Thomas Aquinas that beauty was a &quot;harmony of contrasts&quot;. Following the model of Saint-Denis and later Notre-Dame de Paris, the façade was flanked by two towers proportional to the rest of the façade, which balanced the horizontal and vertical elements. Early Gothic façades often had a small rose window placed above the central portal. In England the rose window was often replaced by several lancet windows.

In the High Gothic period, the façades grew higher, and had more dramatic architecture and sculpture. At Amiens Cathedral (), the porches were deeper, the niches and pinnacles were more prominent. The portals were crowned with high arched gables, composed of concentric arches filled with sculpture. The rose windows became enormous, filling an entirely wall above the central portal, and they were themselves covered with a large pointed arch. The rose windows were pushed upwards by the growing profusion of decoration below. The towers were adorned with their own arches, often crowned with pinnacles. The towers themselves were crowned with spires, often of open-work sculpture. One of the finest examples of a Flamboyant façade is Notre-Dame de l&#x27;Épine (1405–1527).

While French cathedrals emphasized the height of the façade, English cathedrals, particularly in earlier Gothic, often emphasized the width. The west front of Wells Cathedral is 146 feet across, compared with 116 feet wide at the nearly contemporary Amiens Cathedral, though Amiens is twice as high. The west front of Wells was almost entirely covered with statuary, like Amiens, and was given even further emphasis by its colors; traces of blue, scarlet, and gold are found on the sculpture, as well as painted stars against the dark background on other sections.

Italian Gothic façades have the three traditional portals and rose windows, or sometimes simply a large circular window without tracery plus an abundance of flamboyant elements, including sculpture, pinnacles and spires. However, they added distinctive Italian elements. as seen in the façades of Siena Cathedral ) and of Orvieto Cathedral, The Orvieto façade was largely the work of a master mason, Lorenzo Maitani, who worked on the façade from 1308 until his death in 1330. He broke away from the French emphasis on height, and eliminated the column statutes and statuary in the arched entries, and covered the façade with colourful mosaics of biblical scenes (The current mosaics are of a later date). He also added sculpture in relief on the supporting contreforts.

Another important feature of the Italian Gothic portal was the sculpted bronze door. The sculptor Andrea Pisano made the celebrated bronze doors for Florence Baptistry (1330–1336). They were not the first; Abbot Suger had commissioned bronze doors for Saint-Denis in 1140, but they were replaced with wooden doors when the Abbey was enlarged. Pisano&#x27;s work, with its realism and emotion, pointed toward the coming Renaissance.

==East end==
Cathedrals and churches were traditionally constructed with the altar at the east end, so that the priest and congregation faced the rising sun during the morning liturgy. The sun was considered the symbol of Christ and the Second Coming, a major theme in Cathedral sculpture. The portion of the church east of altar is the choir, reserved for members of the clergy. There is usually a single or double ambulatory, or aisle, around the choir and east end, so parishioners and pilgrims could walk freely easily around east end.

In Romanesque churches, the east end was very dark, due to the thick walls and small windows. In the ambulatory of the Basilica of Saint Denis, Abbot Suger first used the novel combination rib vaults and buttresses to replace the thick walls and replace them with stained glass, opening up that portion of the church to what he considered &quot;divine light&quot;.

In French Gothic churches, the east end, or chevet, often had an apse, a semi-circular projection with a vaulted or domed roof. The chevet of large cathedrals frequently had a ring of radiating chapels, placed between the buttresses to get maximum light. There are three such chapels at Chartres Cathedral, seven at Notre Dame de Paris, Amiens Cathedral, Prague Cathedral and Cologne Cathedral, and nine at Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua in Italy. In England, the east end is more often rectangular, and gives access to a separate and large Lady Chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Lady Chapels were also common in Italy.

== Sculpture ==
=== Portals and tympanum ===
Sculpture was an important element of Gothic architecture. Its intent was present the stories of the Bible in vivid and understandable fashion to the great majority of the faithful who could not read. The iconography of the sculptural decoration on the façade was not left to the sculptors. An edict of the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 had declared: &quot;The composition of religious images is not to be left to the inspiration of artists; it is derived from the principles put in place by the Catholic Church and religious tradition. Only the art belongs to the artist; the composition belongs to the Fathers.&quot;

In Early Gothic churches, following the Romanesque tradition, sculpture appeared on the façade or west front in the triangular tympanum over the central portal. Gradually, as the style evolved, the sculpture became more and more prominent, taking over the columns of the portal, and gradually climbing above the portals, until statues in niches covered the entire façade, as in Wells Cathedral, to the transepts, and, as at Amiens Cathedral, even on the interior of the façade.

Some of the earliest examples are found at Chartres Cathedral, where the three portals of the west front illustrate the three epiphanies in the Life of Christ. At Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal depicted the Last Judgement, the right portal showed the Coronation of the Virgin, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese. This set a pattern of complex iconography which was followed at other churches.

The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally representing them as &quot;the pillars of the church&quot;. Each saint had his own symbol at his feet so viewers could recognize them; a winged lion meant Saint Mark, an eagle with four wings meant Saint John the Apostle, and a winged bull symbolized Saint Luke. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the Garden of Eden; grapes represented the wines of Eucharist.

The tympanum over the central portal on the west façade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary.

To make the message even more prominent, the sculpture of the tympanum was painted in bright colors. following a system of colours codified in the 12th century; yellow, called &quot;gold&quot;, symbolized intelligence, grandeur and virtue; white, called &quot;argent&quot;, symbolized purity, wisdom, and correctness; black, or &quot;sable&quot;, meant sadness, but also will; green, or &quot;sinople&quot;, represented hope, liberty and joy; red or &quot;gueules&quot; (see gules) meant charity or victory; blue or &quot;azure&quot; symbolised the sky, faithfulness and perseverance; and violet, or &quot;pourpre&quot;, was the colour of royalty and sovereignty.

In the later Gothic, the sculpture became more naturalistic; the figures were separated from the walls, and had much more expressive faces, showing emotion and personality. The drapery was very skilfully carved. The torments of hell were even more vividly depicted. The late Gothic sculpture at Siena Cathedral, by Nino Pisano, pointing toward the Renaissance, is particularly notable. Much of it is now kept in a museum to protect it from deterioration.

===Grotesques and Labyrinths===

Besides saints and apostles, the exteriors of Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening grotesques or monsters. These included the chimera, a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the strix or stryge, a creature resembling an owl or bat, which was said to eat human flesh. The strix appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet Ovid, who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings. They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.

The gargoyles, which were added to Notre-Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the church, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the church.

Many of the statues at Notre-Dame, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the façade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the French Revolution. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc during the 19th-century restoration. Similar figures appear on the other major Gothic churches of France and England.

Another common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a labyrinth or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolised the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at Amiens Cathedral, have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral still exists essentially in its original form.

==Windows and stained glass==
Increasing the amount of light in the interior was a primary objective of the founders of the Gothic movement. Abbot Suger described the new kind of architecture he had created in the east end of the Saint-Denis: &quot;a circular ring of chapels, by virtue of which the whole church would shine with the wonderful and uninterrupted light of most luminous windows, pervading the interior beauty.&quot;

Religious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a 6th-century mystic whose book, &quot;De Coelesti Hierarchia&quot;, was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine. When the Abbot Suger ordered the reconstruction of choir of the abbey church at Saint-Denis, he had the builders create seventy windows, admitting as much light as possible, as the means by which the faithful could be elevated from the material world to the immaterial world.

The placement of the windows was also determined by religious doctrine. The windows on the north side, frequently in the shade, had windows depicting the Old Testament. The windows of the east, corresponding to the direction of the sunrise, had images of Christ and scenes from the New Testament.

In the Early Gothic period, the glass was particularly thick and was deeply coloured with metal oxides; cobalt for blue, copper for a ruby red, iron for green, and antimony for yellow. The process of making the windows was described in detail by the 12th-century monk known as Theophilus Presbyter. The glass of each colour was melted with the oxide, blown, shaped into small sheets, cracked with a hot iron into small pieces, and assembled on a large table. The details were painted onto the glass in vitreous enamel, then baked in a kiln to fuse the enamel on the glass. The pieces were fit into a framework of thin lead strips, and then put into a more solid frame or iron armatures between the panels. The finished window was set into the stone opening. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called &quot;vergettes&quot; or &quot;barlotierres&quot;, were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass against the wind.

The use of iron rods between the panels of glass and a framework of stone mullions, or ribs, made it possible to create much larger windows. The three rose windows at Chartres (1203–1240) each were more than in diameter. Larger windows also appeared at York Minster (1140–1160) and Canterbury Cathedral (1178–1200)

The stained glass windows were extremely complex and expensive to create. King Louis IX paid for the rose windows in the transept of Notre-Dame de Paris, but other windows were financed by the contributions of the professions or guilds of the city. These windows usually had a panel which illustrated the work of the guild which funded it, such as the drapers, stonemasons, or coopers.

The 13th century saw the introduction of a new kind of window, with grisaille, or white glass, with a geometric pattern, usually joined with medallions of stained glass. These windows allowed much more light into the cathedral, but diminished the vividness of the stained glass, since there was less contrast between the dark interior and bright exterior. The most remarkable and influential work of stained glass in the 13th century was the royal chapel, Sainte-Chapelle (1243–1248), where the windows of the upper chapel, high, occupied all of the walls on the three sides, with 1,134 individual scenes. Sainte-Chapelle became the model for other chapels across Europe.

The 14th century brought a variety of new colours, and the use of more realistic shading and half-toning. This was done by the development of flashed glass. Clear glass was dipped into coloured glass, then portions of the coloured glass were ground away to give exactly the right shade. In the 15th century, artists began painting directly onto the glass with enamel colours. Gradually the art of glass came closer and closer to traditional painting.


One of the most celebrated Flamboyant buildings was the Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes (1370s), with walls of glass from floor to ceiling. The original glass was destroyed, and is replaced by grisaille glass. King&#x27;s College Chapel (15th century), also followed the model of walls entirely filled with glass.

The stained glass windows were extremely complex and expensive to create. King Louis IX paid for the rose windows in the transept of Notre-Dame de Paris, while other windows were often financed by the contributions of the professions or guilds of the city. These windows usually incorporated a panel which illustrates the work of the guild which funded it, such as the drapers, stonemasons, or barrel-makers.

In England, the stained glass windows also grew in size and importance; major examples were the Becket Windows at Canterbury Cathedral (1200–1230) and the windows of Lincoln Cathedral (1200–1220). Enormous windows were also an important element of York Minster and Gloucester Cathedral.

Much of the stained glass in Gothic churches today dates from later restorations, but a few, notably Chartres Cathedral and Bourges Cathedral, still have many of their original windows

===Rose windows===
Rose windows were a prominent feature of many Gothic churches and cathedrals. The rose was a symbol of the Virgin Mary, and they were particularly used in churches dedicated to her. The French Gothic cathedrals of Chartres, Notre Dame de Paris, Reims, and Laon have them in the west façade, and in the transepts as well. Amiens Cathedral, Strasbourg Cathedral and Westminster Abbey also have them in transepts. The designs of their tracery became increasingly complex, and gave their names to two periods; the Rayonnant and the Flamboyant. Two of the most famous Rayonnant rose windows were constructed in the transepts of Notre-Dame in the 13th century.

=== High Gothic architectural elements, 1180–1230 ===

* Flying buttresses developed
* Higher vaults were possible because of the flying buttresses
* Larger clerestory windows because of the flying buttresses.
* Clerestory windows had geometric tracery
* Rose windows became larger, with geometric tracery
* The west front of Notre-Dame set a formula adopted by other cathedrals.
* Transept ends had ornate portals like the west front

===Rayonnant Gothic architectural elements, 1230–1350===

* Cathedrals increasingly tall in relation to width, facilitated by the development of complex systems of buttressing
* Quadripartite vaults over a single bay
* Vaults in France maintained simple forms but elsewhere the patterns of ribs became more elaborate.
* Emphasis on the appearance of high internally.
* Abandonment of fourth stage, either the deep triforium gallery or the shallow tribune gallery, in the internal elevation.
* Columns of classical proportion disappear in favour of increasingly tall columns surrounded by clusters of shafts.
* Complex shafted piers
* Large windows divided by mullions into several lights (vertical panels) with geometric tracery in the arch
* Large rose windows in geometric or radiating designs

===Flamboyant Gothic architectural elements, 1350–1550===

* The design of tracery no longer dependent on circular shapes, developed S curves and flame-like shapes.
* Complex vaults with Flamboyant shapes in the ribs, particularly in Spain and Central Europe, but rare in France
* Many rose windows built with Flamboyant tracery, many in France.
* Large windows of several lights with Flamboyant tracery in the arch
* The Flamboyant arch, drafted from four centres, used for smaller openings, e.g. doorways and niches.
* Mouldings of Flamboyant shape often used as non structural decoration over openings, topped by a floral finial (&quot;poupée&quot;)

== Palaces ==

The Gothic style was used in royal and papal residences as well as in churches. Prominent examples include the Palais de la Cité the Medieval Louvre, the Chateau de Vincennes in Paris, residences of the French kings, the Doge&#x27;s Palace in Venice, and the Palace of the Kings of Navarre in Olite (1269–1512). Another is the Palais des Papes (Palace of the Popes), the former Papal residence in Avignon. It was constructed between 1252 and 1364, during the Avignon Papacy. Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.
The Palais de la Cité in Paris, close to Notre-Dame de Paris, begun in 1119, which was the principal residence of the French kings until 1417. Most of the Palais de la Cité is gone, but two of the original towers along the Seine, of the towers, the vaulted ceilings of the Hall of the Men-at-Arms (1302), (now in the Conciergerie; and the original chapel, Sainte-Chapelle, can still be seen.

The Louvre Palace was originally built by Philippe II of France beginning in 1190 to house the King&#x27;s archives and treasures, and given machicoulis and features of a Gothic fortress. However, it was soon made obsolete by the development of artillery, and in the 15th century it was remodelled into a comfortable residential palace. While the outer walls retained their original military appearance, the castle itself, with a profusion of spires, towers, pinnacles, arches and gables, became a visible symbol of royalty and aristocracy. The style was copied in chateaux and other aristocratic residences across France and other parts of Europe.

== Civic architecture ==
In the 15th century, following the late Gothic period or flamboyant style, elements of Gothic decoration began to appear in the town halls of northern France, Flanders and the Netherlands. The Rouen Courthouse in Normandy is representative of Flamboyant Gothic in France. The Hôtel de Ville of Compiègne has an imposing Gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate accolades or ornamental arches. Similarly flamboyant town halls were found in Arras, Douai, and Saint-Quentin, Aisne, and in modern Belgium, in Brussels, Ghent, Bruges, Audenarde, Mons and Leuven.

Gothic civil architecture in Spain includes the Silk Exchange in Valencia, Spain (1482–1548), a major marketplace, which has a main hall with twisting columns beneath its vaulted ceiling.

==University Gothic==
The Gothic style was adopted in the late 13th to 15th centuries in early English university buildings, with inspiration coming from monasteries and manor houses. The oldest existing example in England is probably the Mob Quad of Merton College at Oxford University, constructed between 1288 and 1378.

The style was further refined by William of Wykeham, Chancellor of England and founder of New College, Oxford, in 1379. His architect, William Wynford, designed the New College quadrangle in the 1380s, which combined a hall, chapel, library, and residences for Fellows and undergraduates. A similar kind of academic cloister was created at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, in the 1140s, likely designed by Reginald Ely.
The design of the colleges was influenced not only by abbeys, but also the design of English manor houses of the 14th and 15th century, such as Haddon Hall in Derbyshire. They were composed of rectangular courtyards with covered walkways which separated the wings. Some colleges, like Balliol College, Oxford, borrowed a military style from Gothic castles, with battlements and crenelated walls.

King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge is one of the finest examples of the late Gothic style. It was built by King Henry VI, who was displeased by the excessive decoration of earlier styles. He wrote in 1447 that he wanted his chapel &quot;to proceed in large form, clean and substantial, setting apart superfluity of too great curious works of entail and busy moulding.&quot; The chapel, built between 1508 and 1515, has glass walls from floor to ceiling, rising to spreading fan vaults designed by John Wastell. The glass walls are supported by large external buttresses concealed at the base by side chapels.

Other European examples include Collegio di Spagna in the University of Bologna, built during the 14th and 15th centuries; the Collegium Carolinum of the Charles University in Prague in the Czech Republic (); the Escuelas mayores of the University of Salamanca in Spain; and the Collegium Maius of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland.

==Military architecture==

In the 13th century, the design of the castle () evolved in response to contact with the more sophisticated fortifications of the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic world during the Crusades. These new fortifications were more geometric, with a central high tower called a keep () which could be defended even if the curtain walls of the castle were breached. The donjon of the Château de Vincennes, begun by Philip VI of France was a good example. It was high, and, even though within the moat and walls of the fortress, had its own separate drawbridge to going to higher floor.

Towers, usually round, were placed at the corners and along the walls in the Phillipienne castle, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, a crenellated parapet with merlons, and projecting machicolations from which missiles could be dropped on besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, &quot;échauguettes&quot; and &quot;bretèches&quot;, from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with arrowslits, which sometimes took the form of crosses to enable a wider field of fire for archers and crossbowmen.

Castles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers. One good surviving example is the Château de Dourdan, near Nemours.

After the end of the Hundred Years War (1337–1453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls. The tower of the Château de Vincennes became a part-time royal residence until the Palace of Versailles was completed.

==Synagogues==

Although Christianity played a dominant role in the Gothic sacred architecture, Jewish communities were present in many European cities during the Middle Ages and they also built their houses of prayer in the Gothic style. Unfortunately, most of the Gothic synagogues did not survive, because they were often destroyed in connection with persecution of the Jews (e. g. in Bamberg, Nürnberg, Regensburg, Vienna). One of the best preserved examples of a Gothic synagogue is the Old New Synagogue in Prague which was completed around 1270 and never rebuilt.

==Influences==

===Romanesque and Norman influence===
Romanesque architecture and Norman architecture had a major influence upon Gothic architecture. The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based upon the plan of the ancient Roman basilica, which was adopted by Romanesque architecture. The Latin cross form, with a nave and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the nave from the collateral aisles, the triforium over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a tympanum filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the flying buttress with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the barrel vault with a round arch to cover the nave, and a groin vault when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. One of the first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque Durham Cathedral, (1093–1104).

Norman Architecture, similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in Lessay Abbey in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. Cefalu Cathedral (1131–1267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Gothic rib vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.

Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland and Croatia, and Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern France while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto López, wherein the French city of Amiens was able to fund its architectural projects whereas Cologne could not because of the economic inequality of the two. This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers. This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing Normandy, Tuscany, Flanders, and the southern Rhineland to enter into competition with France.

===Islamic influence===
The pointed arch, one of the defining attributes of Gothic, was earlier featured in Islamic architecture, Though it did not have the same functions. Precursor of pointed arch appeared in Byzantine and Sassanian architectures, This was evidenced in early church building in Syria and occasional secular structures, like the Karamagara Bridge; in Sassanian architecture, employed in palace and sacred construction. These pre-Islamic arches were decorative rather than structural in their function. The pointed arch as an architectonic principle was first clearly established in Islamic architecture; as an architectonic principle, the pointed arch was entirely alien to the pre-Islamic world. Use of the pointed arch seems to have taken off dramatically in Islamic architecture. It begins to appear throughout the Islamic world in close succession after its adoption in the late Umayyad or early Abbasid period. Some examples are the Al-Ukhaidir Palace (775 AD), the Abbasid reconstruction of the Al-Aqsa mosque in 780 AD, the Ramlah Cisterns (789 AD), the Great Mosque of Samarra (851 AD), and the Mosque of Ibn Tulun (879 AD) in Cairo. It also appears in one of the early reconstructions of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia, and the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba in 987 AD. The pointed arch had already been used in Syria, but in the mosque of Ibn Tulun we have one of the earliest examples of its use on an extensive scale, some centuries before it was exploited in the West by the Gothic architects.

A kind of rib vault was also used in Islamic architecture, for example in the ceiling of the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba. In Cordoba, the dome was supported by pendentives, which connected the dome to the arches below. The pendentives were decorated with ribs. Unlike the Gothic rib vault, the Islamic ribs were purely decorative; they did not extend outside of the vault, and they were not part of the structure supporting the roof.

The military and cultural contacts with the medieval Islamic world, including the Norman conquest of Islamic Sicily in 1090, the Crusades (beginning 1096), and the Islamic presence in Spain, may have influenced Medieval Europe&#x27;s adoption of the pointed arch. Another feature of Gothic architecture, a kind of rib vault, had also earlier appeared in Islamic architecture, and spread to Western Europe via Islamic Spain and Sicily. The early rib vaults in Spain were used to support cupolas, and were decorative. The dome of the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba was supported by pendentives, rather than the vault. These were frequently used in Romanesque and Byzantine architecture, as in the dome of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, which also was supported by pendentives. The Gothic rib vault, among other features, such as the flying buttress, have their antecedents in Romanesque architecture, such as Durham Cathedral, constructed between 1093 and 1096.

In those parts of the Western Mediterranean subject to Islamic control or influence, rich regional variants arose, fusing Romanesque and later Gothic traditions with Islamic decorative forms. For example, in Monreale and Cefalù Cathedrals, the Alcázar of Seville, and Teruel Cathedral.

=== Armenian influence ===
A number of scholars have cited the Armenian Cathedral of Ani, completed 1001 or 1010, as a possible influence on the Gothic, especially due to its use of pointed arches and cluster piers. However, other scholars such as Sirarpie Der Nersessian, who rejected this notion as she argued that the pointed arches did not serve the same function of supporting the vault. Lucy Der Manuelian contends that some Armenians (historically documented as being in Western Europe in the Middle Ages) could have brought the knowledge and technique employed at Ani to the west.

<text>The Old Italic scripts are a family of ancient writing systems used in the Italian Peninsula between about 700 and 100 BC, for various languages spoken in that time and place. The most notable member is the Etruscan alphabet, which was the immediate ancestor of the Latin alphabet used by more than 100 languages today, including English. The runic alphabets used in Northern Europe are believed to have been separately derived from one of these alphabets by the 2nd century AD.

==Origins==
The Old Italic alphabets ultimately derive from the Phoenician alphabet, but the general consensus is that the Etruscan alphabet was imported from the Euboean Greek colonies of Cumae and Ischia (Pithekoūsai) situated in the Gulf of Naples in the 8th century BC; this Euboean alphabet is also called &#x27;Cumaean&#x27; (after Cumae), or &#x27;Chalcidian&#x27; (after its metropolis Chalcis). The Cumaean hypothesis is supported by the 1957–58 excavations of Veii by the British School at Rome, which found pieces of Greek pottery indicating that contacts between the Etruscan city of Veii and the Greek colonies of Cumae and Ischia have existed ever since the second half of the 8th century. Other scholars posit a different hypothetical Western Greek alphabet that was even older than those attested to have given rise to the Etruscan letters. Whatever the case, the Etruscans added the &quot;c&quot;, the &quot;q&quot; and the combination of &quot;vh&quot; or &quot;hv&quot; (for /f/) in order to spell sounds that did not exist in Ancient Greek. The development and usage of their own Greek-derived alphabet arguably marked the end of the Villanovan culture and ushered in the Etruscan Orientalising period.

As the Etruscans were the leading civilization of Italy in that period, it is widely accepted that they spread their alphabet across the peninsula, and the other Old Italic scripts were derived from theirs. Scholars provide three reasons: Etruscans and non-Etruscans had strong contacts in the 8th and 7th centuries, surviving inscriptions from other languages appear later (after the end of the 8th century) than the earliest Etruscan ones (first amongst the Umbrians, Faliscans, Latins, and Sabines to the south, in the 6th century also in the Po Valley and amongst the Cisalpine Celtic, Venetic and Raetic tribes), and the letters used in these texts are evidently based on the Etruscan version of the Western Greek alphabet. However, some of them, including the Latin alphabet, retained certain Greek letters that the Etruscans themselves dropped at a rather early stage.

The Old Italic alphabets were used for various different languages, which included some Indo-European ones (predominantly from the Italic branch, but also in Gaulish and probably in inscriptions interpreted as Proto-Germanic) and some non-Indo-European ones (such as Etruscan itself).

==Alphabets related to Etruscan==
The following table shows the ancient Italic scripts that are presumed to be related to the Etruscan alphabet. Symbols that are assumed to be correspondent are placed on the same column. Many symbols occur with two or more variant forms in the same script; only one variant is shown here. The notations [←] and [→] indicate that the shapes shown were used when writing right-to-left and left-to-right, respectively.

Warning: For the languages marked [?] the appearance of the &quot;Letters&quot; in the table is whatever one&#x27;s browser&#x27;s Unicode font shows for the corresponding code points in the Old Italic Unicode block. The same code point represents different symbol shapes in different languages; therefore, to display those glyph images properly one needs to use a Unicode font specific to that language.



Missing from the above table:
* Venetic
* Faliscan
* Umbrian
* North Picene
* Rhaetic (Raetic)
* Camunic

===Etruscan alphabet===
Various Indo-European languages belonging to the Italic branch (Faliscan and members of the Sabellian group, including Oscan, Umbrian, and South Picene, and other Indo-European branches such as Venetic) originally used the alphabet. Faliscan, Oscan, Umbrian, North Picene, and South Picene all derive from an Etruscan form of the alphabet.

===Nucerian alphabet===
The &quot;Nucerian alphabet&quot; is based on inscriptions found in southern Italy (Nocera Superiore, Sorrento, Vico Equense and other places). It is attested only between the 6th and the 5th century BC.
The most important sign is the /S/, shaped like a fir tree, and possibly a derivation from the Phoenician alphabet.

===Rhaetic alphabets===

Attested in almost 400 inscriptions from mainly the Trentino and South Tyrol regions of Northern Italy, and North Tyrol (Austria) in two distinct alphabets: the alphabet of Sanzeno, and the alphabet of Magrè (near Schio). It was used to write the Rhaetic language.

===Venetic alphabet===
Alphabet of Este: Similar but not identical to that of Magrè, Venetic inscriptions.

===Camunic alphabet===

Inscribed abecedaria and other short inscriptions found on rock drawings in Valcamonica.

===Latin alphabet===
21 of the 26 archaic Etruscan letters were adopted for Old Latin from the 7th century BC, either directly from the Cumae alphabet, or via archaic Etruscan forms, compared to the classical Etruscan alphabet retaining B, D, K, O, Q, X but dropping Θ, Ξ, Ϻ, Φ, and Ψ.

===South Picene alphabet===

The South Picene alphabet, known from the 6th century BC, is most like the southern Etruscan alphabet in that it uses &quot;Q&quot; for /k/ and &quot;K&quot; for /g/.
 is a reduced and is a reduced , used for .

==Unicode==
The Old Italic alphabets were unified and added to the Unicode Standard in March 2001 with the release of version 3.1. The Unicode block for Old Italic is U+10300–U+1032F without specification of a particular alphabet (i.e. the Old Italic alphabets are considered equivalent, and the font used will determine the variant).

Writing direction (right-to-left, left-to-right, or boustrophedon) varies based on the language and even the time period. For simplicity most scholars use left-to-right and this is the Unicode default direction for the Old Italic block. For this reason, the glyphs in the code chart are shown with left-to-right orientation.

<text>Rubus, or Bramble, is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as &quot;brambles&quot;. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries. It is a diverse genus, with the estimated number of &quot;Rubus&quot; species varying from 250 to over 1000, found across all continents except Antarctica.

Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses; spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus. The &quot;Rubus&quot; fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets. The term &quot;cane fruit&quot; or &quot;cane berry&quot; applies to any &quot;Rubus&quot; species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of such plants are also referred to as canes.

== Description ==

Bramble bushes typically grow as shrubs (though a few are herbaceous), with their stems being typically covered in sharp prickles. They grow long, arching shoots that readily root upon contact with soil, and form a soil rootstock from which new shoots grow in the spring. The leaves are either evergreen or deciduous, and simple, lobed, or compound. The shoots typically do not flower or set fruit until the second year of growth (i.e. they are biennial). The rootstock is perennial. Most species are hermaphrodites with male and female parts being present on the same flower. Bramble fruits are aggregate fruits formed from smaller units called drupelets.

Around 60-70% of species of &quot;Rubus&quot; are polyploid (having more than two copies of each chromosome), with species ranging in ploidy from diploid (2x, with 14 chromosomes) to tetradecaploid (14x).

==Taxonomy==
=== Modern classification ===
&quot;Rubus&quot; is the only genus in the tribe Rubeae.

&quot;Rubus&quot; is very complex, particularly within the blackberry/dewberry subgenus (&quot;Rubus&quot;), with polyploidy, hybridization, and facultative apomixis apparently all frequently occurring, making species classification of the great variation in the subgenus one of the grand challenges of systematic botany. In publications between 1910 and 1914, German botanist Wilhelm Olbers Focke attempted to organize the genus into 12 subgenera, a classification system that since became widely accepted, though modern genetic studies have found that many of these subgenera are not monophyletic.

Some treatments have recognized dozens of species each for what other, comparably qualified botanists have considered single, more variable species. On the other hand, species in the other &quot;Rubus&quot; subgenera (such as the raspberries) are generally distinct, or else involved in more routine one-or-a-few taxonomic debates, such as whether the European and American red raspberries are better treated as one species or two (in this case, the two-species view is followed here, with &quot;R. idaeus&quot; and &quot;R. strigosus&quot; both recognized; if these species are combined, then the older name &quot;R. idaeus&quot; has priority for the broader species).

The classification presented below recognizes 13 subgenera within &quot;Rubus&quot;, with the largest subgenus (&quot;Rubus&quot;) in turn divided into 12 sections. Representative examples are presented, but many more species are not mentioned here. A comprehensive 2019 study found subgenera &quot;Orobatus&quot; and &quot;Anoplobatus&quot; to be monophyletic, while all other subgenera to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic.

=== Phylogeny ===
The genus has a likely North American origin, with fossils known from the Eocene-aged Florissant Formation of Colorado, around 34 million years old. &quot;Rubus&quot; expanded into Eurasia, South America, and Oceania during the Miocene. Fossil seeds from the early Miocene of &quot;Rubus&quot; have been found in the Czech part of the Zittau Basin. Many fossil fruits of †&quot;Rubus laticostatus&quot;, †&quot;Rubus microspermus&quot; and †&quot;Rubus semirotundatus&quot; have been extracted from bore hole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland.

Molecular data have backed up classifications based on geography and chromosome number, but following morphological data, such as the structure of the leaves and stems, do not appear to produce a phylogenetic classification.

==== Hybrid berries ====

The term &quot;hybrid berry&quot; is often used collectively for those fruits in the genus &quot;Rubus&quot; which have been developed mainly in the U.S. and U.K. in the last 130 years. As &quot;Rubus&quot; species readily interbreed and are apomicts (able to set seed without fertilisation), the parentage of these plants is often highly complex, but is generally agreed to include cultivars of blackberries (&quot;R. ursinus&quot;, &quot;R. fruticosus&quot;) and raspberries (&quot;R. idaeus&quot;). The British National Collection of &quot;Rubus&quot; stands at over 200 species and, although not within the scope of the National Collection, also hold many cultivars.

The hybrid berries include:-
* loganberry (California, U.S., 1883) &quot;R.&quot; ×&quot;loganobaccus&quot;, a spontaneous hybrid between &quot;R. ursinus&quot; &#x27;Aughinbaugh&#x27; and &quot;R. idaeus&quot; &#x27;Red Antwerp&#x27;
* boysenberry (U.S., 1920s) a hybrid between &quot;R. idaeus&quot; and &quot;R.&quot; × &quot;loganobaccus&quot;
* nectarberry Suspected variant of boysenberry, a hybrid between &quot;R. idaeus&quot; and &quot;R.&quot; × &quot;loganobaccus&quot;
* olallieberry (U.S., 1930s) a hybrid between the loganberry and youngberry, themselves both hybrid berries
* veitchberry (Europe, 1930s) a hybrid between &quot;R. fruticosus&quot; and &quot;R. idaeus&quot;
* skellyberry (Texas, U.S., 2000s), a hybrid between &quot;R. invisus&quot; and &quot;R. phoenicolasius&quot;
* marionberry (1956) now thought to be a blackberry cultivar &quot;R.&quot; &#x27;Marion&#x27;
* silvanberry, &quot;R.&quot; &#x27;Silvan&#x27;, a hybrid between &quot;R.&quot; &#x27;Marion&#x27; and the boysenberry
* tayberry (Dundee, Scotland, 1979), another blackberry/raspberry hybrid
* tummelberry, &quot;R.&quot; &#x27;Tummel&#x27;, from the same Scottish breeding programme as the tayberry
* hildaberry (1980s), a tayberry/boysenberry hybrid discovered by an amateur grower
* youngberry, a complex hybrid of raspberries, blackberries, and dewberries

=== Etymology ===
The generic name means blackberry in Latin and was derived from the word &quot;ruber&quot;, meaning &quot;red&quot;.

The blackberries, as well as various other &quot;Rubus&quot; species with mounding or rambling growth habits, are often called brambles. However, this name is not used for those like the raspberry that grow as upright canes, or for trailing or prostrate species, such as most dewberries, or various low-growing boreal, arctic, or alpine species. The scientific study of brambles is known as &quot;&quot;.
&quot;Bramble&quot; comes from Old English &quot;bræmbel&quot;, a variant of &quot;bræmel&quot;.

<text>In physical geography, a steppe () is an ecoregion characterized by grassland plains without closed forests except near rivers and lakes.
Steppe biomes may include:

* the montane grasslands and shrublands biome
* the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome 
* the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome 

A steppe is usually covered with grass and shrubs, depending on the season and latitude. The term &quot;steppe climate&quot; denotes a semi-arid climate, which is encountered in regions too dry to support a forest, but not dry enough to be a desert.

Steppes are usually characterized by a semi-arid or continental climate. Temperature extremes can be recorded in the summer of up to and in winter of down to . Besides this major seasonal difference, fluctuations between day and night are also significant: in both the highlands of Mongolia and northern Nevada, can be reached during the day with sub-freezing readings at night.

Steppes average of annual precipitation and feature hot summers and cold winters when located in mid-latitudes. In addition to the precipitation level, its combination with potential evapotranspiration defines a steppe climate.

== Classification ==
Steppe can be classified by climate: 
* Temperate steppe: the &quot;true&quot; steppe, found in continental climates can be further subdivided, as in the Rocky Mountains Steppes
* Subtropical steppe: a similar association of plants occurring in the driest areas with a Mediterranean climate; it usually has a short wet period

It can also be classified by vegetation type, e.g. shrub-steppe and alpine-steppe.

===Cold steppe===

The world&#x27;s largest steppe region, often referred to as &quot;the Great Steppe&quot;, is found in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and neighbouring countries stretching from Ukraine in the west through Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to the Altai, Koppet Dag and Tian Shan ranges in China. The Eurasian Steppe had a significant role in the spread of the horse, the wheel and Indo-European languages. In the Eurasian steppe, soils often consist of chernozem.

The inner parts of Anatolia in Turkey, Central Anatolia and East Anatolia in particular and also some parts of Southeast Anatolia, as well as much of Armenia and Iran are largely dominated by cold steppe.

The Pannonian Plain is another steppe region in Central Europe, centered in Hungary but also including portions of Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, and Austria. Another large steppe area (prairie) is located in the central United States, western Canada and the northern part of Mexico. The shortgrass prairie steppe is the westernmost part of the Great Plains region. The Columbia Plateau in southern British Columbia, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington state, is an example of a steppe region in North America outside of the Great Plains.

In South America, cold steppe can be found in Patagonia and much of the high elevation regions east of the southern Andes.

Relatively small steppe areas can be found in the interior of the South Island of New Zealand.

In Australia, a moderately sized temperate steppe region exists in the northern and northwest regions of Victoria, extending to the southern and mid regions of New South Wales. This area borders the semi-arid and arid Australian Outback which is found farther inland on the continent.

===Subtropical steppe===
In Europe, some Mediterranean areas have a steppe-like vegetation, such as central Sicily in Italy, southern Portugal, parts of Greece in the southern Athens area, and central-eastern Spain, especially the southeastern coast (around Murcia), and places cut off from adequate moisture due to rain shadow effects such as Zaragoza.

In northern Africa, the Mediterranean area also hosts the same steppe-like vegetation, such as the Algerian-Moroccan Hautes Plaines and by extension the North Saharan steppe and woodlands.

In Asia, a subtropical steppe can be found in semi-arid lands that fringe the Thar Desert of the Indian subcontinent as well as much of the Deccan Plateau in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats, and the Badia of the Levant.

In Australia, subtropical steppe can be found in a belt surrounding the most severe deserts of the continent and around the Musgrave Ranges.

In North America this environment is typical of transition areas between zones with a Mediterranean climate and true deserts, such as Reno, Nevada, the inner part of California, and much of western Texas and adjacent areas in Mexico.

== Human impact ==
Humans have severe impacts on their environments. Among many examples the following two give only an impression.

* The formation of the forest steppe of Eastern Europe in the fourth millennium BC appeared in the context of the Tripolje culture and very probably, the economy of this culture with its large settlements contributed to the process.
* The formation of the Błędów Desert in Poland in the Middle Ages was certainly man-made.

<text>Typographic units are the units of measurement used in typography or typesetting. Traditional units are different from familiar metric units because they were established in the early days of printing. Though most printing is digital now, the old terms and units have persisted.

Even though these units are all very small, across a line of print they add up quickly. Confusions such as resetting text originally in type of one unit in type of another will result in words moving from one line to the next, resulting in all sorts of typesetting errors (viz. rivers, widows and orphans, disrupted tables, and misplaced captions). Before the popularization of desktop publishing, type measurements were done with a tool called a typometer.

== Development ==
In Europe, the Didot point system was created by François-Ambroise Didot (1730–1804) in c. 1783. Didot&#x27;s system was based on Pierre Simon Fournier&#x27;s (1712–1768), but Didot modified Fournier&#x27;s by adjusting the base unit precisely to a French Royal inch (&quot;pouce&quot;), as Fournier&#x27;s unit was based on a less common foot.

(Fournier&#x27;s printed scale of his point system, from &quot;Manuel Typographique&quot;, Barbou, Paris 1764, enlarged)

However, the basic idea of the point system – to generate different type sizes by multiplying a single minimum unit calculated by dividing a base measurement unit such as one French Royal inch – was not Didot&#x27;s invention, but Fournier&#x27;s. In Fournier&#x27;s system, an approximate French Royal inch (&quot;pouce&quot;) is divided by 12 to calculate 1 &quot;ligne&quot;, which is then divided by 6 to get 1 point. Didot just made the base unit (one French Royal inch) identical to the standard value defined by the government.

&quot;In Didot&#x27;s point system:&quot;
*1 point = 1⁄6 &quot;ligne&quot; = 1⁄72 French Royal inch = 15 625⁄41 559 mm  0.375 971 510 4 mm, however in practice mostly: 0.376 mm (i.e. + 0.0076%).

Both in Didot&#x27;s and Fournier&#x27;s systems, some point sizes have traditional names such as &quot;Cicero&quot; (before introduction of point systems, type sizes were called by names such as &quot;Cicero&quot;, &quot;Pica&quot;, &quot;Ruby&quot;, &quot;Great Primer&quot;, etc.).

*1 &quot;cicero&quot; = 12 Didot points = 1⁄6 French Royal inch = 62 500⁄13 853 mm  4.511 658 124 6 mm, also in practice mostly: 4.512 mm (i.e. + 0.0076%).

The Didot point system has been widely used in European countries. An abbreviation for it that these countries use is &quot;dd&quot;, employing an old method for indicating plurals. Hence &quot;12 dd&quot; means twelve didot points.

In Britain and the United States, many proposals for type size standardization had been made by the end of 19th century (such as Bruce Typefoundry&#x27;s mathematical system that was based on a precise geometric progression). However, no nationwide standard was created until the American Point System was decided in 1886.

The American Point System was proposed by Nelson C. Hawks of Marder Luse &amp; Company in Chicago in the 1870s, and his point system used the same method of size division as Fournier&#x27;s; viz. dividing 1 inch by 6 to get 1 pica, and dividing it again by 12 to get 1 point. However, the American Point System standardized finally in 1886 is different from Hawks&#x27; original idea in that 1 pica is not precisely equal to 1⁄6 inch (neither the Imperial inch nor the US inch), as the United States Type Founders&#x27; Association defined the standard pica to be the Johnson Pica, which had been adopted and used by Mackellar, Smiths and Jordan type foundry (MS&amp;J), Philadelphia. As MS&amp;J was very influential in those days, many other type foundries were using the Johnson Pica. Also, MS&amp;J defined that 83 Picas are equal to 35 centimeters. The choice of the metric unit for the prototype was because at the time the Imperial and US inches differed in size slightly, and neither country could legally specify a unit of the other.

The Johnson Pica was named after Lawrence Johnson who had succeeded Binny &amp; Ronaldson in 1833. Binny &amp; Ronaldson was one of the oldest type foundries in the United States, established in Philadelphia in 1796. Binny &amp; Ronaldson had bought the type founding equipment of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s (1706–1790) type foundry established in 1786 and run by his grandson Benjamin Franklin Bache (1769–1798). The equipment is thought to be that which Benjamin Franklin purchased from Pierre Simon Fournier when he visited France for diplomatic purposes (1776–85).

The official standard approved by the Fifteenth Meeting of the Type Founders Association of the United States in 1886 was this Johnson pica, equal to exactly 0.166 inch. Therefore, the two other – very close – definitions, 1200 / 7227 inch and 350 / 83 mm, are both unofficial.

Monotype wedges used in England and America were based on a pica = .1660 inch. But on the European continent all available wedges were based on the &quot;old-pica&quot; 1 pica - .1667 inch. These wedges were marked with an extra E behind the numbers of the wedge and the set. These differences can also be found in the tables of the manuals.

&quot;In the American point system:&quot;
*1 Johnson pica = exactly 0.166 inch &quot;(versus 0.166 = 1⁄6 inch for the DTP-pica)&quot; = 4.2164 mm.
*1 point = 1⁄12 pica = exactly 0.013 83 inch = 0.351 36 mm.

The American point system has been used in the US, Britain, Japan, and many other countries.

Today, digital printing and display devices and page layout software use a unit that is different from these traditional typographic units. On many digital printing systems (desktop publishing systems in particular), the following equations are applicable (with exceptions, most notably the popular TeX typesetting system and its derivatives&lt;ref name=LaTeX/Length&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;).

*1 pica = 1⁄6 inch (British/American inch of today) = 4.233 mm.
*1 point = 1⁄12 pica = 1⁄72 inch = 127⁄360 mm = 0.3527 mm.

Digital displays and printing led to the use an additional unit:

*1 twip = 1⁄20 point = 1⁄1440 inch = 127⁄7200 mm = 0.017 638 mm.

Fournier&#x27;s original method of division is now restored in today&#x27;s digital typography.

Comparing a piece of type in didots for Continental European countries – 12 dd, for example – to a piece of type for an English-speaking country – 12 pt – shows that the main body of a character is actually about the same size. The difference is that the languages of the former often need extra space atop the capital letters for accent marks (e.g. Ñ, Â, Ö, É), but English rarely needs this.

== Metric units ==
The traditional typographic units are based either on non-metric units, or on odd multiples (such as 35⁄83) of a metric unit. There are no specifically metric units for this particular purpose, although there is a DIN standard sometimes used in German publishing, which measures type sizes in multiples of 0.25 mm, and proponents of the metrication of typography generally recommend the use of the millimetre for typographical measurements, rather than the development of new specifically typographical metric units. The Japanese already do this for their own characters (using the &quot;kyu&quot;, which is &quot;q&quot; in romanized Japanese and is also 0.25 mm), and have metric-sized type for European languages as well. One advantage of the q is that it reintroduces the proportional integer division of 3 mm (12 q) by 6 &amp; 4.

During the age of the French Revolution or Napoleonic Empire, the French established a typographic unit of 0.4 mm, but except for the government&#x27;s print shops, this did not catch on.

In 1973, the &quot;didot&quot; was restandardized in the EU as 0.375 (= 3⁄8) mm. Care must be taken because the name of the unit is often left unmodified. The Germans, however, use the terms Fournier-Punkt and Didot-Punkt for the earlier ones, and Typografischer Punkt for this metric one. The TeX typesetting system uses the abbreviation dd for the earlier definition, and nd for the metric &quot;new didot&quot;

<text>The Wank () is a mountain in southern Germany, situated in the Loisach valley close to the Austrian border in the southwestern Ester Mountains range near Garmisch-Partenkirchen. It rises from about above mean sea level up to at the summit. The mountain is crowned by a grassy summit which has views over Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the surrounding region. The summit can be reached via the eponymous Wankbahn, a cable car system that runs during the summer months, or by a network of footpaths that criss-cross the area. A mountain hut on the summit, the Wank-Haus, provides food and accommodation, and a nearby scientific observatory plays a role in monitoring atmospheric and climatic conditions. The Wank is a destination for hikers, day-trippers from Garmisch-Partenkirchen and paragliders. 

==Physical characteristics==
The mountain&#x27;s geology, which is dominated by calcareous rocks, is typical of the Bavarian Alps. Its climate is also typical of the region. Precipitation is high, ranging from about at valley level to at the summit. It peaks in the summer and is lowest in winter. The Wank&#x27;s mean annual air temperature ranges from in the valley to at the summit. The prevailing wind comes from a westerly direction but for about 30 to 40 days a year the mountain experiences a warm, dry föhn wind. A local wind system also operates in the area giving a daily uphill/downhill circulation. Inversion layers occur for about 30 days per year, predominantly in the autumn and winter.

The Wank was originally covered by a forest consisting of a mix of spruce, fir and beech trees. A process of man-made deforestation that began in the Roman period, when the trees were cut down and the mountain&#x27;s slopes were grazed by horses, sheep, goats and cattle, resulted in much of the forest being destroyed by the 15th century. Forestry in the area was taken over by the Bavarian government in 1803 but the former forest cover did not regenerate due in part to the continued use of forest lands as pasture, storms and browsing by game animals. As a result, the current Wank forest is predominantly spruce (about 75%) and pine (15%). Forestry programmes are currently underway to improve the arboreal diversity of the mountain.

==Wankbahn==
The Wank is linked to Garmisch-Partenkirchen by a cable car system called the Wankbahn, which usually operates between May and September during daylight hours. Construction began in 1928 under the auspices of the Wank-Bahn AG and the cable car entered service in 1929. It is long and rises from above sea level. The system has been upgraded several times since its opening. In 1960 its passenger capacity was increased from 125 to 210 persons per hour. A new Wankbahn was built in 1982, opening on 18 December, which increased the system&#x27;s capacity to 1,000 persons per hour. Two 300 kW DC motors were installed to drive the cable.

The current Wankbahn is built in two sections, measuring long respectively, with a maximum height of above the ground. The Wankbahn&#x27;s 135 cabins each have a capacity of four people. They take approximately 18 minutes at a speed of to reach the summit station. A &quot;Wankpass&quot; permits year-round access to the cable car.

==Summit==
The grassy summit of the Wank is topped by a cross, set up in July 1904 by the Werdenfelser Heimat Partenkirchen society. Nearby is an observatory and the Wank-Haus, also known as the Alois Huber Haus, a mountain hut that provides food and accommodation to visitors. The Wank-Haus was built by the local branch of the German Alpine Association (DAV) in 1911. Its construction was originally proposed in 1894 and was approved by the Bavarian Forest Service in 1903. It was designed by the Partenkirchen DAV&#x27;s Treasurer, Alois Huber, and work began in July 1910. It was opened on 28 May 1911 and was renamed after Huber following his death in 1922. It has since been renovated and upgraded on several occasions, most recently in 2006.

The summit is known for its views across the region, which provide views of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and a panorama of the Zugspitze and the Wetterstein mountain range. Patrons of Garmisch&#x27;s spas sometimes take-in the sunshine at the summit as part of their &quot;Liegekur&quot; (&quot;deckchair cure&quot;).

===Summit observatory===
The summit observatory, which is located at an altitude of , is an important scientific measuring station operated by the Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Since 1972 it has measured a variety of atmospheric and climatic phenomena, including the levels of ozone, nitric oxide, sulphur dioxide and various hydrocarbons in the atmosphere as well as meteorological data such as the levels of temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, wind, global and direct irradiance. It became part of the World Meteorological Organization&#x27;s Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network in 1982. Supplementary meteorological stations have also been established at middle elevation ( above sea level) and in the valley at . This has enabled scientists to measure a range of natural phenomena including the transport of air pollutants in the region and a marked decline since 1990 in the amount of atmospheric mercury pollution, an effect which has been attributed to the post-1989 closure of polluting factories in the former Eastern Bloc states.

==Paragliding==
The mountain is a popular destination for enthusiasts of paragliding who take off from the summit plateau to fly south into the Garmisch-Partenkirchen valley or to peaks in the Wettersteingebirge. The mountain&#x27;s thermals make it popular, as they enable paragliders to make long flights when the weather conditions are right.

==Humour==
The term &quot;wank&quot; is somewhat obscure British jargon for a part of one&#x27;s morning routine; this has made the mountain, and particularly the &quot;Wankpass&quot;, a frequent target of humour among Britishers in the same way as signs bearing the number 420 and 710 (for their connotations in cannabis culture) as well as 714 (for its association with an American brand of methaqualone tablet). Such jokes tend toward references along the lines, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know you needed a pass to wank&quot; etc., along with signage theft, which is criminalised in Germany (the penalty can range up to a year in prison).

<text>Rolemaster (originally Role Master) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game published by Iron Crown Enterprises in 1980. The game system has undergone several revisions and editions since then.

==Description==

&quot;Rolemaster&quot; is a fantasy role-playing game system that has been characterized as highly complex, with a large number of charts and tables to be consulted for every action.

===Character creation and development===
&quot;Rolemaster&quot; characters have ten attributes such as physical strength, memory, self-discipline, and agility with scores between 1 and 100. These scores can be determined either through a point-buy system or randomly. Each attribute is then used to relevant skill bonuses.

Skills are purchased in Ranks; the more ranks a character has in a skill, the more able they are at actions covered by that skill.

===Task resolution===
When a player wishes to attempt an action, the player rolls percentile dice, applies relevant modifiers, and looks the result up on the appropriate chart to determine the result. 

===Combat===
An attacking combatant rolls percentile dice, adds their Offensive Bonus to the total, adds modifiers, and subtracts the defender&#x27;s Defensive Bonus. The total is then applied to a table for the attacker&#x27;s weapon. The attack total is cross-indexed with the type of armor (if any) worn by the defender and the result will be a number of concussion hits dealt, which are then subtracted from the defender&#x27;s running total. If sufficient hits are dealt, the defender may become unconscious.

In addition to concussion hits, some dice rolls will result in a critical hit, which can vary in type and severity. The system of tables details what part of the body has been damaged, describing, as one reviewer noted, &quot;various horrific wounds in graphic detail.&quot;

== Publication history==
&quot;Rolemaster&quot; has a total of five editions.

=== First edition (RM1): 1980–1982 ===
This edition includes five books: &quot;Arms Law&quot;, &quot;Claw Law&quot;, &quot;Spell Law&quot;, &quot;Character Law&quot; and &quot;Campaign Law&quot;. These were available initially as individual books, and later as combined volumes and in boxed sets.

=== Second edition (RM2): 1984–1994 ===
In 1984, an initial boxed set was issued containing both expanded and revised rules. The box included &quot;Spell Law&quot;, and a combined &quot;Arms Law &amp; Claw Law&quot;, &quot;Character Law&quot;, as well as the Vog Mur campaign module for the Loremaster setting.

Shortly after the first box, a new boxed set was released, containing all of the previous contents as well as &quot;The Cloudlords of Tanara&quot;, a detailed setting and adventure supplement. The supplement introduced ICE&#x27;s original Loremaster setting, which would later develop into the more sophisticated &quot;Shadow World&quot;.

Several additional supplementary books were published individually for the second edition, including three &quot;Creatures &amp; Treasures&quot; books, and many companion books that expanded the core rules.

=== Rolemaster Standard System: 1994 ===
In 1994 the game was revised and re-released as &quot;Rolemaster Standard System&quot; (RMSS). The biggest changes were to character generation, particularly in the number of skills available and the method for calculating bonuses for skills. 

Many supplementary rulebooks and accessories were subsequently published.

=== Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing: 1999 ===
In 1999 the game underwent a slight restructuring when &quot;Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing&quot; (RMFRP) was released, but this was mostly a rearranging of material with very few changes to the rules themselves.

The older single-volume &quot;Spell Law&quot; was divided into three separate books, &quot;Of Essence&quot;, &quot;Of Channelling&quot; and &quot;Of Mentalism&quot;, each of which expands that realm of power with additional professions and spell lists.

=== Rolemaster Unified: 2022 ===

Rolemaster Unified is a new edition based on a number of revisions from RMSS/RMFRP editions.

=== Variant systems ===
Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) went defunct in 2000, and in 2001, they sold the intellectual rights to &quot;Rolemaster&quot; to the London-based company Aurigas Aldebaron, while the ICE brand name was licensed to a U.S.-based company named Mjolnir LLC. In 2016, the licensing went to Guild Companion Publications, with whom Aurigas Aldebaron merged. From 2017, the merger changed its name to Iron Crown Enterprises, effectively returning to its original, well-known publisher name.

Throughout the various ownership and publisher name changes, &quot;Rolemaster&quot; remained sufficiently popular that the original books eventually sold out and went out of print. This led to several reprints by the new owners and publishers, resulting in three variants of the original &quot;Rolemaster&quot; game system.

In 1995, the boxed set Rolemaster: The Basics was issued as a simplified version of the &quot;Rolemaster Standard System&quot;. The box contains rulebooks with all rules necessary for playing this simplified variant of the game.

In 2007, the second edition (RM2) rules system was revitalized and issued under the name Rolemaster Classic, or RMC for short. The revitalization was published by Guild Companion Publications and included new versions of all the old core rulebooks of &quot;Arms Law&quot;, &quot;Spell Law&quot;, &quot;Character Law&quot;, and &quot;Creatures and Treasures&quot;, but also an updated &quot;Rolemaster Companion&quot; and a new &quot;Combat Companion&quot; from 2008.

Also in 2007, Rolemaster Express, or RMX for short, was issued by Guild Companion Publications. It is a simplified version of the &quot;Rolemaster Classic System&quot;, with all necessary rules combined into a single book.

==Reception==
In the August 1984 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #88), Arlen Walker queried whether the hefty $48 price tag for the second edition boxed set was worth the money, and provided a long and in-depth examination of the box&#x27;s contents. Walker had quibbles over the combat system, which seemed to generalize rather than individualize weapons; and he felt the book on animal encounters had very little information about the actual animals. Walker concluded, &quot;Is the &quot;Rolemaster&quot; system worth the $48, then? The answer is a resounding &#x27;maybe.&#x27; If you want a freer, more open game than you are currently playing, I’d say it is probably worth it. Even with the inconsistencies noted it still allows more freedom of choice than almost any other game. Although the physical size of the game is rather imposing, the actual mechanics run rather smoothly and simply.&quot;

Walker also reviewed the separately published books &quot;Character Law&quot;, &quot;Campaign Law&quot;, &quot;Spell Law&quot;, &quot;Claw Law&quot; and &quot;Arms Law&quot;. 
* Character Law Although Walker liked the ability to move randomly generated ability scores around to produce the most beneficial results for the character class sought, he disagreed with the system of rolling dice ten times in order to generate character abilities, and then raising two of those abilities up to 90, if they were not already 90 or better. Walker felt this created a monochrome cast of characters and non-player characters. Walker liked the different ways that characters could gain experience points, such as travel, having religious experiences such as visions, and for coming up with a brilliant idea — although he thought this one would probably lead to arguments over which player had originally voiced the germ of the idea. But he didn&#x27;t like the idea that characters get experience points for dying.
* Spell Law Walker was impressed with the variety of spells detailed in &quot;Spell Law&quot;, numbering over two thousand. He found that the &quot;spell-casting system is somewhat more complicated than in other games, but not unplayably so.&quot;
* Arms Law He had quibbles about &quot;Arms Law&quot; — combat was very fast and lethal due to the high amount of damage inflicted by a single blow, and he believed that new players used to other role-playing systems should be made aware of this. Walker also questioned why a character could not parry with a two-handed weapon, although he realized it was probably &quot;a concession to speed of play.&quot;
* Claw Law Walker criticized the lack of descriptions of the animals covered in &quot;Claw Law&quot;, saying, &quot;The animal descriptions have little if anything to do with animals. Calling them descriptions, in fact, is probably overstating the case dramatically... We are told nothing else about the animal, including what it looks like, where it can be found, and how it will behave if found.&quot; Walker went on to question why &quot;Historical Weapons&quot; were found in this book, which was supposed to be about damage from animals and monsters, rather than in &quot;Arms Law&quot;. He also criticized the lack of variety these weapons represented, since to calculate damage and other combat-related numbers for these exotic weapons, referees were simply referred to equivalent weapons in &quot;Arms Law&quot;. &quot;For example, if you wish to have your character use a Katana, you use the same chart as if he were using a broadsword. The cover blurbs (for &quot;Arms Law&quot;) say, &#x27;Because a mace is not an arrow or a scimitar...&#x27; yet this section says a broadsword is both a long sword and a sabre (as well as a Katana) and a dart is a dagger, because they use the same tables.&quot;
* Campaign Law Unlike the first four books, Walker had high praise for &quot;Campaign Law&quot;, saying, &quot;Whether you’re looking for a new system to run or not, &quot;Campaign Law&quot; is definitely worth the $10 price of admission. The information and guidelines this book will give you on fleshing out and filling in a consistent campaign world are almost invaluable. All I can say is that if this book had been available when I first began running campaigns, it would have saved me at least a year of development time.&quot;

Rick Swan reviewed various editions of the game system:
* In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, Swan thought that the second edition game system &quot;reads more like a collection of supplements than an integrated system ... it&#x27;s still extraordinarily complicated and by no means for beginners.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a rating of 2.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;&quot;Rolemaster&quot; lacks the flavor of classic fantasy RPGs such as &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;Runequest&quot;, coming off as a dull collection of numbers and tables.&quot; 
* In the September 1995 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 221), Swan reviewed the updated 144-page &quot;Arms Law&quot; book that had been released in conjunction with the revised &quot;Rolemaster Standard System&quot; edition. Swan still found the complexity of the &quot;Rolemaster&quot; system astounding, saying, &quot;With its tidal wave of numbers, formulas, and tables, the &quot;Rolemaster&quot; game always struck me as the kind of fantasy RPG that calculus professors play on their day off.&quot; Swan found &quot;Arms Law&quot; to be &quot;mainly a book of tables — more than 100 pages worth.&quot; He gave the book an average rating of 4 out of 6, and recommended it only for the mathematically inclined: &quot;If you read computer manuals for fun, if you get misty-eyed thinking about your high school algebra class, if you wonder why your friends complain about something as trivial as filling out tax forms, then &quot;Rolemaster&quot; ought to be right up your alley. &quot;Arms Law&quot; is as good a place as any to begin your investigation.&quot;
* In the July 1996 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 231), Swan reviewed the new supplement &quot;Arcane Companion&quot; that had been published in conjunction with the revision of the magic system in the &quot;Rolemaster Standard System&quot; edition. Swan reiterated that the &quot;Rolemaster&quot; system was a mathematician&#x27;s delight: &quot;Saturated with charts and numbers, it&#x27;s for players who buy pocket calculators by the crate... If you&#x27;re the kind of guy who needs his fingers to do arithmetic, this ain&#x27;t your kind of game.&quot; Despite this, Swan found &quot;Arcane Companion&quot; to be &quot;not only comprehensible, but entertaining, thanks to the designers’ efforts to infuse the facts and figures with vivid imagery.&quot; Swan concluded that because this supplement was so solidly linked to the &quot;Rolemaster&quot; system, it could not be ported to another game system, but &quot;experienced players should welcome this ambitious expansion with open arms. And if you’re among those who’ve dismissed &quot;Rolemaster&quot; as not worth the effort, sneak a peek at &quot;Arcane Companion&quot;; it might tempt you to reconsider.&quot;

In a 1996 reader poll conducted by UK games magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; to determine the 50 best roleplaying systems, &quot;Rolemaster&quot; was ranked 15th. &quot;Arcane&quot; editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;Often used as an archetypal example of a complex roleplaying system, &quot;Rolemaster&quot; is a fairly numbers-heavy game that also relies on the use of a lot of tables. Most notable are its notorious &#x27;critical hit&#x27; charts, which are subdivided by damage type and describe various horrific wounds in graphic detail. If you&#x27;re looking for a highly detailed and fairly complex system, &quot;Rolemaster&quot; has a great deal to recommend it. The rules are fairly well organised and very flexible, easily adaptable to a wide variety of situations. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re not one for tables and calculations, it&#x27;s probably not going to ring your bell.&quot;

Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2013 rated &quot;Rolemaster&quot; as #6 in the top ten role-playing games of all time, saying &quot;Also attributed to the frame of the &quot;Middle-Earth Role-Playing Game&quot;, which was the 2nd most popular fantasy RPG of the 1980s, I.C.E.&#x27;s &quot;Rolemaster&quot; must certainly make a showing as something of a heavyweight in the industry, even if it no longer exists as an entity&quot;.

=== Supplementary publications ===
Several publications and magazines with supplementary game material has been issued under the ICE brand over the years.

For the Rolemaster Standard System, &quot;Rolemaster Annual 1996&quot; and &quot;Rolemaster Annual 1997&quot; included new additional rules for that game system, including new professions, races, spelllists, and errata.

For the Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing system, Guild Companion Publications (GCP) issued &quot;Rolemaster Quarterly&quot; from April 2006 to August 2007. The magazine was dedicated to presenting optional rules and play material, and a total of seven magazines were published.

Several Electronic Roleplaying Assistants (ERAs) have been issued for use with the RMC, RMSS and RMFRP systems since 2005. They are computer applications, developed for use with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux, helping players and game masters running the game digitally, including character creation and management.

<text>The IS–LM model, or Hicks–Hansen model, is a two-dimensional macroeconomic model which is used as a pedagogical tool in macroeconomic teaching. The IS–LM model shows the relationship between interest rates and output in the short run in a closed economy. The intersection of the &quot;investment–saving&quot; (IS) and &quot;liquidity preference–money supply&quot; (LM) curves illustrates a &quot;general equilibrium&quot; where supposed simultaneous equilibria occur in both the goods and the money markets. The IS–LM model shows the importance of various demand shocks (including the effects of monetary policy and fiscal policy) on output and consequently offers an explanation of changes in national income in the short run when prices are fixed or sticky. Hence, the model can be used as a tool to suggest potential levels for appropriate stabilisation policies. It is also used as a building block for the demand side of the economy in more comprehensive models like the AD–AS model.

The model was developed by John Hicks in 1937 and was later extended by Alvin Hansen as a mathematical representation of Keynesian macroeconomic theory. Between the 1940s and mid-1970s, it was the leading framework of macroeconomic analysis. Today, it is generally accepted as being imperfect and is largely absent from teaching at advanced economic levels and from macroeconomic research, but it is still an important pedagogical introductory tool in most undergraduate macroeconomics textbooks. 

As monetary policy since the 1980s and 1990s generally does not try to target money supply as assumed in the original IS–LM model, but instead targets interest rate levels directly, some modern versions of the model have changed the interpretation (and in some cases even the name) of the LM curve, presenting it instead simply as a horizontal line showing the central bank&#x27;s choice of interest rate. This allows for a simpler dynamic adjustment and supposedly reflects the behaviour of actual contemporary central banks more closely.

==History==
The IS–LM model was introduced at a conference of the Econometric Society held in Oxford during September 1936. Roy Harrod, John R. Hicks, and James Meade all presented papers
describing mathematical models attempting to summarize John Maynard Keynes&#x27; &quot;General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money&quot;. Hicks, who had seen a draft of Harrod&#x27;s paper, invented the IS–LM model (originally using the abbreviation &quot;LL&quot;, not &quot;LM&quot;). He later presented it in
&quot;Mr. Keynes and the Classics: A Suggested Interpretation&quot;. Hicks and Alvin Hansen developed the model further in the 1930s and early 1940s, Hansen extending the earlier contribution.
The model became a central tool of macroeconomic teaching for many decades. Between the 1940s and mid-1970s, it was the leading framework of macroeconomic analysis. It was particularly suited to illustrate the debate of the 1960s and 1970s between Keynesians and monetarists as to whether fiscal or monetary policy was most effective to stabilize the economy. Later, this issue faded from focus and came to play only a modest role in discussions of short-run fluctuations. 

The IS-LM model assumes a fixed price level and consequently cannot in itself be used to analyze inflation. This was of little importance in the 1950s and early 1960s when inflation was not an important issue, but became problematic with the rising inflation levels in the late 1960s and 1970s, which led to extensions of the model to also incorporate aggregate supply in some form, e.g. in the form of the AD–AS model, which can be regarded as an IS-LM model with an added supply side explaining rises in the price level.

One of the basic assumptions of the IS-LM model is that the central bank targets the money supply. However, a fundamental rethinking in central bank policy took place from the early 1990s when central banks generally changed strategies towards targeting inflation rather than money growth and using an interest rate rule to achieve their goal. As central banks started paying little attention to the money supply when deciding on their policy, this model feature became increasingly unrealistic and sometimes confusing to students. David Romer in 2000 suggested replacing the traditional IS-LM framework with an IS-MP model, replacing the positively sloped LM curve with a horizontal MP curve (where MP stands for &quot;monetary policy&quot;). He advocated that it had several advantages compared to the traditional IS-LM model. John B. Taylor independently made a similar recommendation in the same year. After 2000, this has led to various modifications to the model in many textbooks, replacing the traditional LM curve and story of the central bank influencing the interest rate level indirectly via controlling the supply of money in the money market to a more realistic one of the central bank determining the policy interest rate as an exogenous variable directly.

Today, the IS-LM model is largely absent from macroeconomic research, but it is still a backbone conceptual introductory tool in many macroeconomics textbooks. 

==Formation==

The point where the IS and LM schedules intersect represents a short-run equilibrium in the real and monetary sectors (though not necessarily in other sectors, such as labor markets): both the product market and the money market are in equilibrium. This equilibrium yields a unique combination of the interest rate and real GDP.

===IS (investment–saving) curve===

The IS curve shows the causation from interest rates to planned investment to national income and output.

For the investment–saving curve, the independent variable is the interest rate and the dependent variable is the level of income. The IS curve is drawn as downward-sloping with the interest rate &quot;r&quot; on the vertical axis and GDP (gross domestic product: &quot;Y&quot;) on the horizontal axis. The IS curve represents the locus where total spending (consumer spending + planned private investment + government purchases + net exports) equals total output (real income, &quot;Y&quot;, or GDP).

The IS curve also represents the equilibria where total private investment equals total saving, with saving equal to consumer saving &quot;plus&quot; government saving (the budget surplus) &quot;plus&quot; foreign saving (the trade surplus). The level of real GDP (Y) is determined along this line for each interest rate. Every level of the real interest rate will generate a certain level of investment and spending: lower interest rates encourage higher investment and more spending. The multiplier effect of an increase in fixed investment resulting from a lower interest rate raises real GDP. This explains the downward slope of the IS curve. In summary, the IS curve shows the causation from interest rates to planned fixed investment to rising national income and output.

The IS curve is defined by the equation
:formula_1
where &quot;Y&quot; represents income, formula_2 represents consumer spending increasing as a function of disposable income (income, &quot;Y&quot;, minus taxes, &quot;T&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;), which themselves depend positively on income), formula_3 represents business investment decreasing as a function of the real interest rate, &quot;G&quot; represents government spending, and &quot;NX&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) represents net exports (exports minus imports) decreasing as a function of income (decreasing because imports are an increasing function of income).

===LM (liquidity-money) curve===

The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rates and levels of real income for which the money market is in equilibrium. It shows where money demand equals money supply. For the LM curve, the independent variable is income and the dependent variable is the interest rate.

In the money market equilibrium diagram, the liquidity preference function is the willingness to hold cash. The liquidity preference function is downward sloping (i.e. the willingness to hold cash increases as the interest rate decreases). Two basic elements determine the quantity of cash balances demanded:
# Transactions demand for money: this includes both (a) the willingness to hold cash for everyday transactions and (b) a precautionary measure (money demand in case of emergencies). Transactions demand is positively related to real GDP. As GDP is considered exogenous to the liquidity preference function, changes in GDP shift the curve. 
# Speculative demand for money: this is the willingness to hold cash instead of securities as an asset for investment purposes. Speculative demand is inversely related to the interest rate. As the interest rate rises, the opportunity cost of holding money rather than investing in securities increases. So, as interest rates rise, speculative demand for money falls.

Money supply is determined by central bank decisions and willingness of commercial banks to loan money. Money supply in effect is perfectly inelastic with respect to nominal interest rates. Thus the money supply function is represented as a vertical line – money supply is a constant, independent of the interest rate, GDP, and other factors. Mathematically, the LM curve is defined by the equation formula_4, where the supply of money is represented as the real amount &quot;M&quot;/&quot;P&quot; (as opposed to the nominal amount &quot;M&quot;), with &quot;P&quot; representing the price level, and &quot;L&quot; being the real demand for money, which is some function of the interest rate and the level of real income.

An increase in GDP shifts the liquidity preference function rightward and hence increases the interest rate. Thus the LM function is positively sloped.

==Shifts==
One hypothesis is that a government&#x27;s deficit spending (&quot;fiscal policy&quot;) has an effect similar to that of a lower saving rate or increased private fixed investment, increasing the amount of demand for goods at each individual interest rate. An increased deficit by the national government shifts the IS curve to the right. This raises the equilibrium interest rate (from i1 to i2) and national income (from Y1 to Y2), as shown in the graph above. The equilibrium level of national income in the IS–LM diagram is referred to as aggregate demand.

Keynesians argue spending may actually &quot;crowd in&quot; (encourage) private fixed investment via the accelerator effect, which helps long-term growth. Further, if government deficits are spent on productive public investment (e.g., infrastructure or public health) that spending directly and eventually raises potential output, although not necessarily more (or less) than the lost private investment might have. The extent of any crowding out depends on the shape of the LM curve. A shift in the IS curve along a relatively flat LM curve can increase output substantially with little change in the interest rate. On the other hand, a rightward shift in the IS curve along a vertical LM curve will lead to higher interest rates, but no change in output (this case represents the &quot;Treasury view&quot;).

Rightward shifts of the IS curve also result from exogenous increases in investment spending (i.e., for reasons other than interest rates or income), in consumer spending, and in export spending by people outside the economy being modelled, as well as by exogenous decreases in spending on imports. Thus these too raise both equilibrium income and the equilibrium interest rate. Of course, changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the IS curve in the opposite direction.

The IS–LM model also allows for the role of monetary policy. If the money supply is increased, that shifts the LM curve downward or to the right, lowering interest rates and raising equilibrium national income. Further, exogenous decreases in liquidity preference, perhaps due to improved transactions technologies, lead to downward shifts of the LM curve and thus increases in income and decreases in interest rates. Changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the LM curve in the opposite direction.

==IS–LM model with interest targeting central bank==

The fact that contemporary central banks normally do not target the money supply, as assumed by the original IS–LM model, but instead conduct their monetary policy by steering the interest rate directly, has led to increasing criticism of the traditional IS–LM setup since 2000 for being outdated and confusing to students. In some textbooks, the traditional LM curve derived from an explicit money market equilibrium story consequently has been replaced by an LM curve simply showing the interest rate level determined by the central bank. Notably this is the case in Olivier Blanchard&#x27;s widely-used intermediate-level textbook &quot;Macroeconomics&quot; since its 7th edition in 2017.

In this case, the LM curve becomes horizontal at the interest rate level chosen by the central bank, allowing a simpler kind of dynamics. Also, the interest rate level measured along the vertical axis may be interpreted as either the nominal or the real interest rate, in the latter case allowing inflation to enter the IS–LM model in a simple way. The output level is still determined by the intersection of the IS and LM curves. The LM curve may shift because of a change in monetary policy or possibly a change in inflation expectations, whereas the IS curve as in the traditional model may shift either because of a change in fiscal policy affecting government consumption or taxation, or because of shocks affecting private consumption or investment (or, in the open-economy version, net exports). Additionally, the model distinguishes between the policy interest rate determined by the central bank and the market interest rate which is decisive for firms&#x27; investment decisions, and which is equal to the policy interest rate plus a premium which may be interpreted as a risk premium or a measure of the market power or other factors influencing the business strategies of commercial banks. This premium allows for shocks in the financial sector being transmitted to the goods market and consequently affecting aggregate demand.

Similar models, though called slightly different names, appear in the textbooks by Charles Jones and by Wendy Carlin and David Soskice and the CORE Econ project. Parallelly, texts by Akira Weerapana and Stephen Williamson have outlined approaches where the LM curve is replaced with a real interest rate rule.

==Incorporation into larger models==
By itself, the traditional IS–LM model is used to study the short run when prices are fixed or sticky, and no inflation is taken into consideration. In addition, the model is often used as a sub-model of larger models which allow for a flexible price level. The addition of a supply relation enables the model to be used for both short- and medium-run analysis of the economy, or to use a different terminology: classical and Keynesian analysis.

A main example of this is the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply model – the AD–AS model. In the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model, each point on the aggregate demand curve is an outcome of the IS–LM model for aggregate demand Y based on a particular price level. Starting from one point on the aggregate demand curve, at a particular price level and a quantity of aggregate demand implied by the IS–LM model for that price level, if one considers a higher potential price level, in the IS–LM model the real money supply M/P will be lower and hence the LM curve will be shifted higher, leading to lower aggregate demand as measured by the horizontal location of the IS–LM intersection; hence at the higher price level the level of aggregate demand is lower, so the aggregate demand curve is negatively sloped.

In the 2018 textbook &quot;Macroeconomics&quot; by Daron Acemoglu, David Laibson and John A. List, the corresponding model combining a traditional IS-LM setup with a relation for a changing price level is named an IS-LM-FE model (FE standing for &quot;full equilibrium&quot;).

===AD-AS-like models with inflation instead of price levels=== 

In many modern textbooks, the traditional AD–AS diagram is replaced by a variation in which the variables are not output and the price level, but instead output and inflation (i.e., the change in the price level). In this case, the relation corresponding to the AS curve is normally derived from a Phillips curve relationship between inflation and the unemployment gap. As policymakers and economists are generally concerned about inflation levels and not actual price levels, this formulation is considered more appropriate. This variation is often referred to as a dynamic AD–AS model, but may also have other names. Olivier Blanchard in his textbook uses the term IS–LM–PC model (PC standing for Phillips curve). Others, among them Carlin and Soskice, refer to it as the &quot;three-equation New Keynesian model&quot;, the three equations being an IS relation, often augmented with a term that allows for expectations influencing demand, a monetary policy (interest) rule and a short-run Phillips curve.

==Variations ==

===IS-LM-NAC model===

In 2016, Roger Farmer and Konstantin Platonov presented a so-called IS-LM-NAC model (NAC standing for &quot;no arbitrage condition&quot;, in casu between physical capital and financial assets), in which the long-run effect of monetary policy depends on the way in which people form beliefs. The model was an attempt to integrate the phenomenon of secular stagnation in the IS-LM model. Whereas in the IS-LM model, high unemployment would be a temporary phenomenon caused by sticky wages and prices, in the IS-LM-NAC model high unemployment may be a permanent situation caused by pessimistic beliefs - a particular instance of what Keynes called animal spirits. The model was part of a broader research agenda studying how beliefs may independently influence macroeconomic outcomes.

<doc id="54058" wikidata="Q887231" url="?curid=54058" title="Hypanthium">
<text>In angiosperms, a hypanthium or floral cup is a structure where basal portions of the calyx, the corolla, and the stamens form a cup-shaped tube. It is sometimes called a floral tube, a term that is also used for corolla tube and calyx tube. It often contains the nectaries of the plant. It is present in many plant families, although varies in structural dimensions and appearance. This differentiation between the hypanthium in particular species is useful for identification. Some geometric forms are obconic shapes as in toyon, whereas some are saucer-shaped as in &quot;Mitella caulescens&quot;.

Its presence is diagnostic of many families, including the Rosaceae, Grossulariaceae, and Fabaceae. In some cases, it can be so deep, with such a narrow top, that the flower can appear to have an inferior ovarythe ovary is below the other attached floral parts. The hypanthium is known by different common names in differing species. In the eucalypts, it is referred to as the &quot;gum nut&quot;; in roses it is called the hip.

==Variations in plant species==


In myrtles, the hypanthium can either surround the ovary loosely or tightly; in some cases, it can be fused to the walls of the ovary. It can vary in length. The rims around the outside of the hypanthium contain the calyx lobes or free sepals, petals and either the stamen or multiple stamen that are attached at one or two points.
The flowers of the family Rosaceae, or the rose family, always have some type of hypanthium or at least a floral cup from which the sepals, petals and stamens all arise, and which is lined with nectar-producing tissue known as nectaries. The nectar is a sugary substance that attracts birds and bees to the flower, who then take the pollen from the lining of the hypanthium and transfer it to the next flower they visit, usually a neighbouring plant.

The stamens borne on the hypanthium are the pollen-producing reproductive organs of the flower. The hypanthium helps in many ways with the reproduction and cross pollination pathways of most plants. It provides weather protection and a medium to sustain the lost pollen, increasing the probability of fertility and cross-pollination. The retained pollen can then attach to pollinators such as birds, bees, moths, beetles, bats, butterflies and other animals. Wind can act as an instigator for fertilisation. The hypanthium is also an adaptive feature for structural support. It helps the stem fuse with the flower, in turn strengthening the bond and overall stability and integrity.

<text>The City of Westminster is a London borough with city status in Greater London, England. It is the site of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Houses of Parliament and much of the British government. It contains a large part of central London, including most of the West End, such as the major shopping areas around Oxford Street, Regent Street, Piccadilly and Bond Street, and the entertainment district of Soho. Many London landmarks are within the borough, including Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Whitehall, Westminster Cathedral, 10 Downing Street, and Trafalgar Square.

The borough also has a number of major parks and open spaces, including Hyde Park, and most of Regent&#x27;s Park. Away from central London the borough also includes various inner suburbs, including St John&#x27;s Wood, Maida Vale, Bayswater, Belgravia and Pimlico. The borough had a population of 204,300 at the 2021 census.

The original settlement of Westminster was historically a separate urban area to the west of London, growing up around the minster church of Westminster Abbey. Westminster was an important centre of royal authority from Saxon times, and was declared a city in 1540. It was gradually absorbed into the urban area of London, but London&#x27;s official city boundaries remained unchanged, covering just the area called the City of London, broadly corresponding to the medieval walled city. From the 19th century some metropolis-wide administrative bodies were introduced. The County of London was created in 1889, replaced in 1965 by the larger administrative area of Greater London, which since 2000 has been led by the Mayor of London. The cities of London and Westminster retain their separate city statuses despite having long been part of the same urban area.

The modern borough was created in 1965 as part of the same reforms which created Greater London, covering the area of the three former metropolitan boroughs of Westminster, Paddington and St Marylebone. The local authority is Westminster City Council. To the east, Westminster borders the City of London, with the boundary marked by Temple Bar. Other neighbouring boroughs (anti-clockwise from north-east) are Camden, Brent, Kensington and Chelsea, Wandsworth and Lambeth, the latter two being separated from Westminster by the River Thames. Charing Cross in Westminster is the notional centre of London, being the point from which distances from London are measured.

==History==
After the depopulation of Roman London in the 5th century, an Anglo Saxon agricultural and trade settlement likely developed to its west, associated with the Middle Saxons, sometimes called Lundenwic (&#x27;London village&#x27; or London port&#x27;). Over time, Lundenburh (&#x27;London fort&#x27;), the former Roman city with its still-existing Roman walls, was repopulated and Lundenwic declined, becoming pastoral and partly known as Aldwych (Aldwic—&#x27;old village&#x27;), the name of which lives on for a section of Westminster.

The origins of the City of Westminster pre-date the Norman Conquest of England. In the mid-11th century, King Edward the Confessor began the construction of an abbey at Westminster, only the foundations of which survive today. Between the abbey and the river he built a palace, thereby guaranteeing that the seat of Government would be fixed at Westminster, and inevitably drawing power and wealth west out of the old City of London.

For centuries Westminster and the City of London were geographically quite distinct. It was not until the sixteenth century that houses began to be built over the adjoining fields, eventually absorbing nearby villages such as Marylebone and Kensington, and gradually creating the vast Greater London that exists today.

Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries abolished the abbey at Westminster, although the former abbey church is still called Westminster Abbey. The church was briefly the cathedral of the Diocese of Westminster created from part of the Diocese of London in 1540, by letters patent which also granted city status to Westminster, a status retained after the diocese was abolished in 1550.

===Administrative history===
The area was historically part of the county of Middlesex. Whilst an important centre of royal authority from Saxon times, Westminster was not formally incorporated as a borough for local government purposes until 1900. However, it was declared a city in 1540 on the elevation of Westminster Abbey to being a cathedral. From at least 1545 there was also a Westminster parliamentary borough (constituency). The Anglican Diocese of Westminster was short-lived, being absorbed back into the Diocese of London in 1550. Despite having no borough corporation and having ceased to be the seat of a diocese, Westminster continued to be described as a city. In 1585 the Westminster Court of Burgesses was established to administer certain judicial powers in an area known as the City and Liberty of Westminster.
From 1856 the area was also governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards. Within the City and Liberty of Westminster, the three parishes of St George Hanover Square, St James Piccadilly and St Martin-in-the-Fields were governed by their vestries, whilst the parishes covering the central part of Westminster formed the Westminster District and the parishes and territories adjoining the border with the City of London formed the Strand District. Beyond the liberty to the north, the two parishes of Paddington and St Marylebone were also governed by their vestries. The Westminster District was renamed the St Margaret and St John Combined Vestry in 1887, and unsuccessfully petitioned to be incorporated as a borough in 1897.

In 1900 the lower tier of local government within the County of London was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs. The parish of Paddington became the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington, and the parish of the St Marylebone became the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone. The various territories within the old City and Liberty of Westminster became the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. The new boroughs came into being on 1 November 1900; a few days ahead of that a royal charter was issued conferring city status on the new borough of Westminster from its creation. The Court of Burgesses, which had ceded most practical powers to the newer authorities, was finally abolished in 1901.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963. It was a merger of the old Paddington, St Marylebone and Westminster metropolitan boroughs, and Westminster&#x27;s city status was transferred to the enlarged borough. In 1966 the city was granted the right to appoint a lord mayor.

==Governance==
The local authority is Westminster City Council, which meets at Westminster Council House (also known as Marylebone Town Hall) and has its main offices at Westminster City Hall on Victoria Street.

<text>An amphitheatre (U.S. English: amphitheater) is an open-air venue used for entertainment, performances, and sports. The term derives from the ancient Greek (&#x27;), from (&#x27;), meaning &quot;on both sides&quot; or &quot;around&quot; and (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;place for viewing&quot;.

Ancient Greek theatres were typically built on hillsides and semi-circular in design. The first amphitheatre may have been built at Pompeii around 70 BC. Ancient Roman amphitheatres were oval or circular in plan, with seating tiers that surrounded the central performance area, like a modern open-air stadium. In contrast, both ancient Greek and ancient Roman theatres were built in a semicircle, with tiered seating rising on one side of the performance area.

Modern English parlance uses &quot;amphitheatre&quot; for any structure with sloping seating, including theatre-style stages with spectator seating on only one side, theatres in the round, and stadia. They can be indoor or outdoor.

==Roman amphitheatres==

About 230 Roman amphitheatres have been found across the area of the Roman Empire. Their typical shape, functions and name distinguish them from Roman theatres, which are more or less semicircular in shape; from the circuses (similar to hippodromes) whose much longer circuits were designed mainly for horse or chariot racing events; and from the smaller stadia, which were primarily designed for athletics and footraces.

Roman amphitheatres were circular or oval in plan, with a central arena surrounded by perimeter seating tiers. The seating tiers were pierced by entrance-ways controlling access to the arena floor, and isolating it from the audience. Temporary wooden structures functioning as amphitheaters would have been erected for the funeral games held in honour of deceased Roman magnates by their heirs, featuring fights to the death by gladiators, usually armed prisoners of war, at the funeral pyre or tomb of the deceased. These games are described in Roman histories as &quot;&quot;, gifts, entertainments or duties to honour deceased individuals, Rome&#x27;s gods and the Roman community.

Some Roman writers interpret the earliest attempts to provide permanent amphitheaters and seating for the lower classes as populist political graft, rightly blocked by the Senate as morally objectionable; too-frequent, excessively &quot;luxurious&quot; &quot;&quot; would corrode traditional Roman morals. The provision of permanent seating was thought a particularly objectionable luxury.

The earliest permanent, stone and timber Roman amphitheatre with perimeter seating was built in the in 29 BCE. Most were built under Imperial rule, from the Augustan period (27 BCE–14 CE) onwards. Imperial amphitheatres were built throughout the Roman Empire, especial in provincial capitals and major colonies, as an essential aspect of &quot;Romanitas&quot;. There was no standard size; the largest could accommodate 40,000–60,000 spectators. The most elaborate featured multi-storeyed, arcaded façades and were decorated with marble, stucco and statuary. The best-known and largest Roman amphitheatre is the Colosseum in Rome, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (&quot;&quot;), after the Flavian dynasty who had it built. After the ending of gladiatorial games in the 5th century and of staged animal hunts in the 6th, most amphitheatres fell into disrepair. Their materials were mined or recycled. Some were razed, and others were converted into fortifications. A few continued as convenient open meeting places; in some of these, churches were sited.

==Modern amphitheatres==


In modern english usage of the word, an amphitheatre is not only a circular, but can also be a semicircular or curved performance space, particularly one located outdoors. Contemporary amphitheatres often include standing structures, called bandshells, sometimes curved or bowl-shaped, both behind the stage and behind the audience, creating an area which echoes or amplifies sound, making the amphitheatre ideal for musical or theatrical performances. Small-scale amphitheatres can serve to host outdoor local community performances.

Notable modern amphitheatres include the Shoreline Amphitheatre, the Hollywood Bowl and the Aula Magna at Stockholm University. The term &quot;amphitheatre&quot; is also used for some indoor venues, such as the (by now demolished) Gibson Amphitheatre and Chicago International Amphitheatre.

In other languages (like German) an amphitheatre can only be a circular performance space. A performance space where the audience is not all around the stage can not be called an amphitheatre—by definition of the word.

==Natural amphitheatres==
A natural amphitheatre is a performance space located in a spot where a steep mountain or a particular rock formation naturally amplifies or echoes sound, making it ideal for musical and theatrical performances. An amphitheatre can be naturally occurring formations which would be ideal for this purpose, even if no theatre has been constructed there.

Notable natural amphitheatres include the Drakensberg Amphitheatre in South Africa, Slane Castle in Ireland, the Supernatural Amphitheatre in Australia, and the Red Rocks and the Gorge Amphitheatres in the western United States.

There is evidence that the Anasazi people used natural amphitheatres for the public performance of music in Pre-Columbian times including a large constructed performance space in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.

<doc id="54062" wikidata="Q5273898" url="?curid=54062" title="Southwark">
<text>Southwark ( ) is a district of Central London situated on the south bank of the River Thames, forming the north-western part of the wider modern London Borough of Southwark. The district, which is the oldest part of South London, developed due to its position at the southern end of the early versions of London Bridge, for centuries the only dry crossing on the river. Around 43 AD, engineers of the Roman Empire found the geographic features of the south bank here suitable for the placement and construction of the first bridge.

London&#x27;s historic core, the City of London, lay north of the bridge and for centuries the area of Southwark just south of the bridge was partially governed by the City, while other areas of the district were more loosely governed. The section known as Liberty of the Clink became a place of entertainment. By the 12th century Southwark had been incorporated as an ancient borough, and this historic status is reflected in the alternative name of the area, as Borough. The ancient borough of Southwark&#x27;s river frontage extended from the modern borough boundary, just to the west of the Oxo Tower, to St Saviour&#x27;s Dock (originally the mouth of the River Neckinger) in the east. In the 16th century, parts of Southwark near London Bridge became a formal City ward, Bridge Without.

The urban area expanded over the years and Southwark was completely separated administratively from the now small City in 1900. Like other parts of London, it now falls under the Mayor of London and London Assembly in addition to its Burough authority. Local points of interest include Southwark Cathedral, Borough Market, Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe theatre, The Shard, Tower Bridge, Butler&#x27;s Wharf and the Tate Modern museum.

==History==
===Toponymy===

The name &quot;Suthriganaweorc&quot; or &quot;Suthringa geweorche&quot; is recorded for the area in the 10th-century Anglo-Saxon document known as the &quot;Burghal Hidage&quot; and means &quot;fort of the men of Surrey&quot; or &quot;the defensive work of the men of Surrey&quot;. Southwark is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Sudweca&quot;. The name means &quot;southern defensive work&quot; and is formed from the Old English &quot;sūþ&quot; (south) and &quot;weorc&quot; (work). The southern location is in reference to the City of London to the north, Southwark being at the southern end of London Bridge. In Old English, Surrey means &quot;southern district (or the men of the southern district)&quot;, so the change from &quot;southern district work&quot; to the latter &quot;southern work&quot; may be an evolution based on the elision of the single syllable ge element, meaning district.

===Rome===

Recent excavation has revealed pre-Roman activity including evidence of early ploughing, burial mounds and ritual activity.

The natural geography of Southwark (now much altered by human activity), was the principal determining factor for the location of London Bridge, and therefore London itself.

====Natural setting====
Until relatively recent times, the Thames in central London was much wider and shallower at high tide. The natural shoreline of the City Of London was a short distance further back than it is now, and the high tide shoreline on the Southwark side was much further back, except for the area around London Bridge.

Southwark was mostly made up of a series of often marshy tidal islands in the Thames, with some of the waterways between these island formed by branches of the River Neckinger, a tributary of the Thames. A narrow strip of higher firmer ground ran on a N-S alignment and, even at high tide, provided a much narrower stretch of water, enabling the Romans to bridge the river.

As the lowest bridging point of the Thames in Roman Britain, it determined the position of Londinium; without London Bridge there is unlikely to have been a settlement of any importance in the area; previously the main crossing had been a ford near Vauxhall Bridge. Because of the bridge and the establishment of London, the Romans routed two Roman roads into Southwark: Stane Street and Watling Street which met in what in what is now Borough High Street.

For centuries London Bridge was the only Thames bridge in the area, until a bridge was built upstream more than to the west.

====Archaeological finds====
In February 2022, archaeologists from the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) announced the discovery of a well-preserved massive Roman mosaic which is believed to date from A.D. 175–225. The dining room (triclinium) mosaic was patterned with knot patterns known as the Solomon&#x27;s knot and dark red and blue floral and geometric shapes known as guilloche.

Archaeological work at Tabard Street in 2004 discovered a plaque with the earliest reference to &#x27;Londoners&#x27; from the Roman period on it.

====End of Roman Southwark====
Londinium was abandoned at the end of the Roman occupation in the early 5th century and both the city and its bridge collapsed in decay. The settlement at Southwark, like the main settlement of London to the north of the bridge, had been more or less abandoned, a little earlier, by the end of the fourth century.

=== Saxons and Vikings ===
====King Alfred the Great====
Southwark appears to recover only during the time of King Alfred and his successors. Sometime about 886, the &quot;burh&quot; of Southwark was created and the Roman city area reoccupied. It was probably fortified to defend the bridge and hence the reemerging City of London to the north.

====St Olaf====
This defensive role is highlighted by the role of the bridge in the 1014-1016 war between King Ethelred the Unready and his ally Olaf II Haraldsson (later King of Norway, and afterwards known as &quot;St Olaf&quot;, or &quot;St Olave&quot;) on one side, and Sweyn Forkbeard and his son Cnut (later King Cnut), on the other.

London submitted to Swein in 1014, but on Swein&#x27;s death, Ethelred returned, with Olaf in support. Swein had fortified London and the bridge, but according to Snorri Sturleson&#x27;s saga, Edgar and Olaf tied ropes from the bridge&#x27;s supporting posts and pulled it into the river, together with the Danish army, allowing Ethelred to recapture London. This may be the origin of the nursery rhyme &quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot;.

There was a church, St Olave&#x27;s Church, dedicated to St Olaf before the Norman Conquest and this survived until the 1920&#x27;s. St Olaf House (part of London Bridge Hospital), named after the church and its saint, stands on the spot. Tooley Street, being a corruption of &quot;St Olave&#x27;s Street&quot;, also takes its name from the former church.

====King Canute====
Cnut returned in 1016, but capturing the city was a great challenge. To cut London off from upstream riverborne supplies, Cnut dug a trench around Southwark, so that he could sail or drag his ships around Southwark and get upstream in a way that allowed his boats to avoid the heavily defended London Bridge. In so doing he hoped to cut London off from river borne resupply from upstream. The Dane&#x27;s efforts to recapture London were in vain, until he defeated Ethelred at the Battle of Assandun in Essex later that year, and became King of England. It is thought that the section of the Kent Road, at Lock Bridge, was &quot;Canute&#x27;s Trench&quot;. In May, 1016, In 1173, a channel following a similar course was used to drain the Thames to allowing building work on London Bridge.

===Later medieval period===
Southwark and in particular the Bridge, proved a formidable obstacle against William the Conqueror in 1066. He failed to force the bridge during the Norman conquest of England, but Southwark was devastated.

At Domesday, the area&#x27;s assets were: Bishop Odo of Bayeux held the monastery (the site of modern Southwark Cathedral) and the tideway, which still exists as St Mary Overie dock; the King owned the church (probably St Olave&#x27;s) and its tidal stream (St Olave&#x27;s Dock); the dues of the waterway or mooring place were shared between King William I and Earl Godwin; the King also had the toll of the strand; and &quot;men of Southwark&quot; had the right to &quot;a haw and its toll&quot;. Southwark&#x27;s value to the King was £16. Much of Southwark was originally owned by the church – the greatest reminder of monastic London is Southwark Cathedral, originally the priory of St Mary Overie.

During the early Middle Ages, Southwark developed and was one of the four Surrey towns which returned Members of Parliament for the first commons assembly in 1295. An important market occupied the High Street from some time in the 13th century, which was controlled by the city&#x27;s officers—it was later removed in order to improve traffic to the Bridge, under a separate Trust by Act of Parliament of 1756 as the Borough Market on the present site. The area was renowned for its inns, especially The Tabard, from which Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s pilgrims set off on their journey in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.
The continuing defensive importance of London Bridge was demonstrated by its important role in thwarting Jack Cade&#x27;s Rebellion in 1450; Cade&#x27;s army tried to force its way across the bridge to enter the City, but was foiled in a battle which cost 200 lives. The bridge was also closed during the Siege of London in 1471, helping to foil attempts by the Bastard of Fauconberg to cross and capture the City.

===Post-medieval===
Just west of the Bridge was the Liberty of the Clink manor, which was never controlled by the city, but was held under the Bishopric of Winchester&#x27;s nominal authority. This lack of oversight helped the area become the entertainment district for London, with a concentration of sometimes disreputable attractions such as bull and bear-baiting, taverns, theatre and brothels.

In the 1580s, Reasonable Blackman worked as a silk weaver in Southwark, as one of the first people of African heritage to work as independent business owners in London in that era. In 1587, Southwark&#x27;s first playhouse theatre, The Rose, opened. The Rose was set up by Philip Henslowe, and soon became a popular place of entertainment for all classes of Londoners. Both Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare, two of the finest writers of the Elizabethan age, worked at the Rose.

In 1599 the Globe Theatre, in which Shakespeare was a shareholder, was erected on the Bankside in the Liberty of the Clink. It burned down in 1613, and was rebuilt in 1614, only to be closed by the Puritans in 1642 and subsequently pulled down not long thereafter. A modern replica, called Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, has been built near the original site. The impresario in the later Elizabethan period for these entertainments was Shakespeare&#x27;s colleague Edward Alleyn, who left many local charitable endowments, most notably Dulwich College.

During the Second English Civil War, a force of Kentish Royalist Rebels approached London, hoping the lightly defended city might fall to them, or that the citizens would rise in their favour, however their hopes were quashed when Philip Skippon, in charge of the defence swiftly fortified the bridge making it all but impregnable to the modest Royalist force.

On 26 May 1676, ten years after the Great Fire of London, a great fire broke out, which continued for 17 hours before houses were blown up to create fire breaks. King Charles II and his brother, James, Duke of York, oversaw the effort.

There was also a famous fair in Southwark which took place near the Church of St George the Martyr. William Hogarth depicted this fair in his engraving of &quot;Southwark Fair&quot; (1733).

Southwark was also the location of several prisons, including those of the Crown or Prerogative Courts, the Marshalsea and King&#x27;s Bench prisons, those of the local manors&#x27; courts, e.g., Borough Compter, The Clink and the Surrey county gaol originally housed at the White Lion Inn (also informally called the Borough Gaol) and eventually at Horsemonger Lane Gaol.

One other local family is of note, the Harvards. John Harvard went to the local parish free school of St Saviour&#x27;s and on to Cambridge University. He migrated to the Massachusetts Colony and left his library and the residue of his will to the new college there, named after him as its first benefactor. Harvard University maintains a link, having paid for a memorial chapel within Southwark Cathedral (his family&#x27;s parish church), and where its UK-based alumni hold services. John Harvard&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house is in Stratford-upon-Avon.

===Urbanisation===
In 1836 the first railway in the London area was created, the London and Greenwich Railway, originally terminating at Spa Road and later extended west to London Bridge.

In 1861, another great fire in Southwark destroyed a large number of buildings between Tooley Street and the Thames, including those around Hays Wharf (later replaced by Hays Galleria) and blocks to the west almost as far as St Olave&#x27;s Church.

The first deep-level underground tube line in London was the City and South London Railway, now the Bank branch of the Northern line, opened in 1890, running from King William Street south through Borough to Stockwell. Southwark, since 1999, is also now served by Southwark, Bermondsey and London Bridge stations on the Jubilee line.

==Administrative history==

Southwark is thought to have become a burh in 886. The area appears in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 within the hundred of Brixton as held by several Surrey manors.

The ancient borough of Southwark, enfranchised in 1295, initially consisted of the pre-existing Surrey parishes of St George the Martyr, St Olave, St Margaret and St Mary.

St Margaret and St Mary were abolished in 1541 and their former area combined to create Southwark St Saviour. Around 1555 Southwark St Thomas was split off from St Olave, and in 1733 Southwark St John Horsleydown was also split off.

In 1855 the parishes came into the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The large St George the Martyr parish was governed by its own administrative vestry, but the smaller St John Horsleydown, St Olave and St Thomas parishes were grouped together to form the St Olave District. St Saviour was combined with Southwark Christchurch (the former liberty of Paris Garden) to form the St Saviour&#x27;s District. In 1889 the area became part of the new County of London. St Olave and St Thomas were combined as a single parish in 1896.

The ancient borough of Southwark, was traditionally known simply as The Borough – or Borough – to distinguish it from &#x27;The City&#x27;, and this name has persisted as an alternative name for the area. The medieval heart of Southwark was also, simultaneously, referred to as the ward of Bridge Without when administered by the city (from 1550 to 1900) and as an aldermanry until 1978.

The local government arrangements were reorganised in 1900 with the creation of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. It comprised the parishes of Southwark Christchurch, Southwark St Saviours, Southwark St George the Martyr and Newington. The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark was based at the former Newington Vestry Hall, now known as Walworth Town Hall. The eastern parishes that had formed the St Olave District instead became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. In 1965 the two boroughs were combined with the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell to form the current London Borough of Southwark.

A new Diocese of Southwark was established in 1905 from parts of the Diocese of Rochester; the diocese serves large parts of south London and Surrey.

===Relationship with the City of London===
Southwark was outside of the control of the City of London and was a haven for criminals and free traders, who would sell goods and conduct trades outside the regulation of the city&#x27;s Livery Companies. In 1327 the City obtained control from King Edward III of the manor next to the south side of London Bridge known as the Town of Southwark (called latterly the Guildable Manor—i.e., the place of taxes and tolls). The Livery Companies also ensured that they had jurisdiction over the area.

From the Norman period manorial organisation obtained through major lay and ecclesiastic magnates. Southwark still has vestiges of this because of the connection with the City of London. In 1327 the city acquired from Edward III the original vill of Southwark and this was also described as &quot;the borough&quot;. In 1536 Henry VIII acquired the Bermondsey Priory properties and in 1538 that of the Archbishop. In 1550 these were sold to the city.

After many decades of petitioning, in 1550 Southwark was incorporated into the City of London as the ward of Bridge Without. However, the Alderman was appointed by the Court of Aldermen and no Common Councilmen were ever elected. This ward was constituted of the original Guildable Manor and the properties previously held by the church, under a charter of Edward VI, latterly called the King&#x27;s Manor or Great Liberty. These manors are still constituted by the City under a Bailiff and Steward with their Courts Leet and View of Frankpledge Juries and Officers which still meet—their annual assembly being held in November under the present High Steward (the Recorder of London). The Ward and Aldermanry were effectively abolished in 1978, by merging it with the Ward of Bridge Within. These manorial courts were preserved under the Administration of Justice Act 1977. Therefore, between 1750 and 1978 Southwark had two persons (the Alderman and the Recorder) who were members of the city&#x27;s Court of Aldermen and Common Council who were elected neither by the City freemen or by the Southwark electorate but appointed by the Court of Aldermen.

===Contemporary governance and representation===
The Borough and Bankside Community Council corresponds to the Southwark electoral wards of Cathedrals and Chaucer. They are part of the Bermondsey and Old Southwark Parliament constituency whose Member of Parliament is Neil Coyle. It is within the Lambeth and Southwark London Assembly constituency. Until 2022 Southwark was the location of City Hall, the administrative headquarters of the Greater London Authority and the meeting place of the London Assembly and Mayor of London. Since 2009, Southwark London Borough Council has its main offices at 160 Tooley Street, having moved administrative staff from the Camberwell Town Hall.

== Geography and attractions ==
In common with much of the south bank of the Thames, the Borough has seen extensive regeneration in the last decade. Declining wharfage trade, light industry and factories have given way to residential development, shops, restaurants, galleries, and bars. Most notably, major office developments have arisen along London Bridge City and More London between Tooley Street and the riverside, housing international headquarters of accountancy, legal and other professional services consultancies. More London, in particular, features London&#x27;s former City Hall building. The area is in easy walking distance of the City and the West End, which has helped its growth as a major business centre. London&#x27;s tallest skyscraper, the Shard, is next to London Bridge Station.

To the north is the River Thames and London Bridge station. Southwark Cathedral, a priory then parish church, was made a cathedral in 1905, and is noted for its Merbecke Choir. Borough Market is a well-developed visitor attraction and has grown in size. The adjacent units have been converted and form a gastronomic focus for London. Borough High Street runs roughly north to south from London Bridge towards Elephant and Castle. The Borough runs further to the south than often realised; both St George&#x27;s Cathedral and the Imperial War Museum are within the ancient boundaries, which border nearby Lambeth.

Its entertainment district, in its heyday at the time of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre (which stood 1599–1642) has revived in the form of the post-1997 reinvention of the original theatre, Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, incorporating other smaller theatre spaces, an exhibition about Shakespeare&#x27;s life and work and which neighbours Vinopolis and the London Dungeon. The Southbank area, primarily in Lambeth but shared with Southwark also hosts many artistic venues.

At its heart is the area known as Borough, which has an eclectic covered and semi-covered market and numerous food and drink venues as well as the skyscraper The Shard. The Borough is generally an area of mixed development, with council estates, major office developments, social housing and high value residential gated communities side by side with each other.

=== Transport ===
The area has three main tube stations: Borough, Southwark and one close to the river, which is combined with a railway terminus; London Bridge.

<text>Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a subfield of symbolic artificial intelligence which uses logic programming as a uniform representation for examples, background knowledge and hypotheses. The term &quot;inductive&quot; here refers to philosophical (i.e. suggesting a theory to explain observed facts) rather than mathematical (i.e. proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set) induction. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesised logic program which entails all the positive and none of the negative examples.

* Schema: &quot;positive examples&quot; + &quot;negative examples&quot; + &quot;background knowledge&quot; ⇒ &quot;hypothesis&quot;.

Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing.

== History ==
Building on earlier work on Inductive inference, Gordon Plotkin was the first to formalise induction in a clausal setting around 1970, adopting an approach of generalising from examples. In 1981, Ehud Shapiro introduced several ideas that would shape the field in his new approach of model inference, an algorithm employing refinement and backtracing to search for a complete axiomatisation of given examples. His first implementation was the Model Inference System in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred Horn clause logic programs from positive and negative examples. The term &quot;Inductive Logic Programming&quot; was first introduced in a paper by Stephen Muggleton in 1990, defined as the intersection of machine learning and logic programming. Muggleton and Wray Buntine introduced predicate invention and inverse resolution in 1988.

Several inductive logic programming systems that proved influential appeared in the early 1990s. FOIL, introduced by Ross Quinlan in 1990 was based on upgrading propositional learning algorithms AQ and ID3. Golem, introduced by Muggleton and Feng in 1990, went back to a restricted form of Plotkin&#x27;s least generalisation algorithm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Springer/Ohmsha&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Progol system, introduced by Muggleton in 1995, first implemented inverse entailment, and inspired many later systems. Aleph, a descendant of Progol introduced by Ashwin Srinivasan in 2001, is still one of the most widely used systems .

At around the same time, the first practical applications emerged, particularly in bioinformatics, where by 2000 inductive logic programming had been successfully applied to drug design, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity prediction, and elucidation of the structure and function of proteins. Unlike the focus on automatic programming inherent in the early work, these fields used inductive logic programming techniques from a viewpoint of relational data mining. The success of those initial applications and the lack of progress in recovering larger traditional logic programs shaped the focus of the field.

Recently, classical tasks from automated programming have moved back into focus, as the introduction of meta-interpretative learning makes predicate invention and learning recursive programs more feasible. This technique was pioneered with the Metagol system introduced by Muggleton, Dianhuan Lin, Niels Pahlavi and Alireza Tamaddoni-Nezhad in 2014. This allows ILP systems to work with fewer examples, and brought successes in learning string transformation programs, answer set grammars and general algorithms.

== Setting ==
Inductive logic programming has adopted several different learning settings, the most common of which are learning from entailment and learning from interpretations. In both cases, the input is provided in the form of &quot;background knowledge &quot;, a logical theory (commonly in the form of clauses used in logic programming), as well as positive and negative examples, denoted formula_1 and formula_2 respectively. The output is given as a &quot;hypothesis&quot; &quot;&quot;, itself a logical theory that typically consists of one or more clauses.

The two settings differ in the format of examples presented.

=== Learning from entailment ===
, learning from entailment is by far the most popular setting for inductive logic programming. In this setting, the &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; examples are given as finite sets formula_1 and formula_2 of positive and negated ground literals, respectively. A &quot;correct hypothesis&quot; &quot;&quot; is a set of clauses satisfying the following requirements, where the turnstile symbol formula_5 stands for logical entailment:
formula_6
Completeness requires any generated hypothesis &#x27; to explain all positive examples formula_1, and consistency forbids generation of any hypothesis &#x27; that is inconsistent with the negative examples formula_2, both given the background knowledge &quot;&quot;.

In Muggleton&#x27;s setting of concept learning, &quot;completeness&quot; is referred to as &quot;sufficiency&quot;, and &quot;consistency&quot; as &quot;strong consistency&quot;. Two further conditions are added: &quot;Necessity&quot;, which postulates that &#x27; does not entail formula_1, does not impose a restriction on &#x27;, but forbids any generation of a hypothesis as long as the positive facts are explainable without it. &quot;Weak consistency&quot;, which states that no contradiction can be derived from formula_10, forbids generation of any hypothesis &#x27; that contradicts the background knowledge &#x27;. Weak consistency is implied by strong consistency; if no negative examples are given, both requirements coincide. Weak consistency is particularly important in the case of noisy data, where completeness and strong consistency cannot be guaranteed.

=== Learning from interpretations ===
In learning from interpretations, the &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; examples are given as a set of complete or partial Herbrand structures, each of which are themselves a finite set of ground literals. Such a structure &quot;&quot; is said to be a model of the set of clauses formula_11 if for any substitution formula_12 and any clause formula_13 in formula_11 such that formula_15, formula_16 also holds. The goal is then to output a hypothesis that is &quot;complete,&quot; meaning every positive example is a model of formula_11, and &quot;consistent,&quot; meaning that no negative example is a model of formula_11.

== Approaches to ILP ==
An &quot;inductive logic programming system&quot; is a program that takes as an input logic theories formula_19 and outputs a correct hypothesis with respect to theories formula_19. A system is &quot;complete&quot; if and only if for any input logic theories formula_19 any correct hypothesis with respect to these input theories can be found with its hypothesis search procedure. Inductive logic programming systems can be roughly divided into two classes, search-based and meta-interpretative systems.

Search-based systems exploit that the space of possible clauses forms a complete lattice under the subsumption relation, where one clause formula_22 subsumes another clause formula_23 if there is a substitution formula_12 such that formula_25, the result of applying formula_12 to formula_22, is a subset of formula_23. This lattice can be traversed either bottom-up or top-down.

=== Bottom-up search ===
Bottom-up methods to search the subsumption lattice have been investigated since Plotkin&#x27;s first work on formalising induction in clausal logic in 1970. Techniques used include least general generalisation, based on anti-unification, and inverse resolution, based on inverting the resolution inference rule.

==== Least general generalisation ====
A &quot;least general generalisation algorithm&quot; takes as input two clauses formula_22 and formula_23 and outputs the least general generalisation of formula_22 and formula_23, that is, a clause formula_33 that subsumes formula_22 and formula_23, and that is subsumed by every other clause that subsumes formula_22 and formula_23. The least general generalisation can be computed by first computing all &quot;selections&quot; from formula_33 and formula_39, which are pairs of literals formula_40 sharing the same predicate symbol and negated/unnegated status. Then, the least general generalisation is obtained as the disjunction of the least general generalisations of the individual selections, which can be obtained by first-order syntactical anti-unification.

To account for background knowledge, inductive logic programming systems employ &quot;relative least general generalisations&quot;, which are defined in terms of subsumption relative to a background theory. In general, such relative least general generalisations are not guaranteed to exist; however, if the background theory &#x27; is a finite set of ground literals, then the negation of &#x27; is itself a clause. In this case, a relative least general generalisation can be computed by disjoining the negation of &quot;&quot; with both formula_22 and formula_23 and then computing their least general generalisation as before.

Relative least general generalisations are the foundation of the bottom-up system Golem.

==== Inverse resolution ====
Inverse resolution is an inductive reasoning technique that involves the resolution operator.

Inverse resolution takes information about the resolvent of a resolution step to compute possible resolving clauses. Two types of inverse resolution operator are in use in inductive logic programming: V-operators and W-operators. A V-operator takes clauses formula_43 and formula_22as input and returns a clause formula_23 such that formula_43 is the resolvent of formula_22 and formula_23. A W-operator takes two clauses formula_49 and formula_50 and returns three clauses formula_22, formula_23 and formula_53 such that formula_49 is the resolvent of formula_22 and formula_23 and formula_50 is the resolvent of formula_23 and formula_53.

Inverse resolution was first introduced by Stephen Muggleton and Wray Buntine in 1988 for use in the inductive logic programming system Cigol. By 1993, this spawned a surge of research into inverse resolution operators and their properties.

=== Top-down search ===
The ILP systems Progol, Hail and Imparo find a hypothesis using the principle of the inverse entailment for theories , , : formula_60. First they construct an intermediate theory called a bridge theory satisfying the conditions formula_61 and formula_62. Then as formula_63, they generalize the negation of the bridge theory with anti-entailment. However, the operation of anti-entailment is computationally more expensive since it is highly nondeterministic. Therefore, an alternative hypothesis search can be conducted using the inverse subsumption (anti-subsumption) operation instead, which is less non-deterministic than anti-entailment.

Questions of completeness of a hypothesis search procedure of specific inductive logic programming system arise. For example, the Progol hypothesis search procedure based on the inverse entailment inference rule is not complete by &quot;Yamamoto&#x27;s example&quot;. On the other hand, Imparo is complete by both anti-entailment procedure and its extended inverse subsumption procedure.

=== Metainterpretive learning ===
Rather than explicitly searching the hypothesis graph, metainterpretive or &quot;meta-level&quot; systems encode the inductive logic programming program as a meta-level logic program which is then solved to obtain an optimal hypothesis. Formalisms used to express the problem specification include Prolog and answer set programming, with existing Prolog systems and answer set solvers used for solving the constraints.

And example of a Prolog-based system is Metagol, which is based on a meta-interpreter in Prolog, while ASPAL and ILASP are based on an encoding of the inductive logic programming problem in answer set programming.

=== Evolutionary learning ===
Evolutionary algorithms in ILP use a population-based approach to evolve hypotheses, refining them through selection, crossover, and mutation. Methods like EvoLearner have been shown to outperform traditional approaches on structured machine learning benchmarks.

== Probabilistic inductive logic programming ==
Probabilistic inductive logic programming adapts the setting of inductive logic programming to learning probabilistic logic programs. It can be considered as a form of statistical relational learning within the formalism of probabilistic logic programming.

Given

# background knowledge as a probabilistic logic program , and
# a set of positive and negative examples formula_64 and formula_2

the goal of probabilistic inductive logic programming is to find a probabilistic logic program formula_66 such that the probability of positive examples according to formula_67 is maximized and the probability of negative examples is minimized.

This problem has two variants: parameter learning and structure learning. In the former, one is given the structure (the clauses) of and the goal is to infer the probabilities annotations of the given clauses, while in the latter the goal is to infer both the structure and the probability parameters of . Just as in classical inductive logic programming, the examples can be given as examples or as (partial) interpretations.

=== Parameter Learning ===
Parameter learning for languages following the distribution semantics has been performed by using an expectation-maximisation algorithm or by gradient descent.
An expectation-maximisation algorithm consists of a cycle in which the steps of expectation and maximization are repeatedly performed. In the expectation step, the distribution of the hidden variables is computed according to the current values of the probability parameters, while in the maximisation step, the new values of the parameters are computed. 
Gradient descent methods compute the gradient of the target function and iteratively modify the parameters moving in the direction of the gradient.

=== Structure Learning ===
Structure learning was pioneered by Daphne Koller and Avi Pfeffer in 1997, where the authors learn the structure of first-order rules with associated probabilistic uncertainty parameters. Their approach involves generating the underlying graphical model in a preliminary step and then applying expectation-maximisation.

In 2008, De Raedt et al. presented an algorithm for performing theory compression on ProbLog programs, where theory compression refers to a process of removing as many clauses as possible from the theory in order to maximize the probability of a given set of positive and negative examples. No new clause can be added to the theory.

In the same year, Meert, W. et al. introduced a method for learning parameters and structure of ground probabilistic logic programs by considering the Bayesian networks equivalent to them and applying techniques for learning Bayesian networks.

ProbFOIL, introduced by De Raedt and Ingo Thon in 2010, combined the inductive logic programming system FOIL with ProbLog. Logical rules are learned from probabilistic data in the sense that both the examples themselves and their classifications can be probabilistic. The set of rules has to allow one to predict the probability of the examples from their description. In this setting, the parameters (the probability values) are fixed and the structure has to be learned.

In 2011, Elena Bellodi and Fabrizio Riguzzi introduced SLIPCASE, which performs a beam search among probabilistic logic programs by iteratively refining probabilistic theories and optimizing the parameters of each theory using expectation-maximisation. 
Its extension SLIPCOVER, proposed in 2014, uses bottom clauses generated as in Progol to guide the refinement process, thus reducing the number of revisions and exploring the search space more effectively. Moreover, SLIPCOVER separates the search for promising clauses from that of the theory: the space of clauses is explored with a beam search, while the space of theories is searched greedily.

<doc id="54077" wikidata="Q12623" url="?curid=54077" title="Perpetual motion">
<text>Perpetual motion is the motion of bodies that continues forever in an unperturbed system. A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely without an external energy source. This kind of machine is impossible, since its existence would violate the first and/or second laws of thermodynamics.

These laws of thermodynamics apply regardless of the size of the system. For example, the motions and rotations of celestial bodies such as planets may appear perpetual, but are actually subject to many processes that slowly dissipate their kinetic energy, such as solar wind, interstellar medium resistance, gravitational radiation and thermal radiation, so they will not keep moving forever.

Thus, machines that extract energy from finite sources cannot operate indefinitely because they are driven by the energy stored in the source, which will eventually be exhausted. A common example is devices powered by ocean currents, whose energy is ultimately derived from the Sun, which itself will eventually burn out.

In 2016, new states of matter, time crystals, were discovered in which, on a microscopic scale, the component atoms are in continual repetitive motion, thus satisfying the literal definition of &quot;perpetual motion&quot;. However, these do not constitute perpetual motion machines in the traditional sense, or violate thermodynamic laws, because they are in their quantum ground state, so no energy can be extracted from them; they exhibit motion without energy.

==History==

The history of perpetual motion machines dates back to the Middle Ages. For millennia, it was not clear whether perpetual motion devices were possible or not, until the development of modern theories of thermodynamics showed that they were impossible. Despite this, many attempts have been made to create such machines, continuing into modern times. Modern designers and proponents often use other terms, such as &quot;over unity&quot;, to describe their inventions.

== Basic principles ==

There is a scientific consensus that perpetual motion in an isolated system violates either the first law of thermodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics, or both. The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy. The second law can be phrased in several different ways, the most intuitive of which is that heat flows spontaneously from hotter to colder places; relevant here is that the law observes that in every macroscopic process, there is friction or something close to it; another statement is that no heat engine (an engine which produces work while moving heat from a high temperature to a low temperature) can be more efficient than a Carnot heat engine operating between the same two temperatures.

In other words:

# In any isolated system, one cannot create new energy (law of conservation of energy). As a result, the thermal efficiency—the produced work power divided by the input heating power—cannot be greater than one. 
# The output work power of heat engines is always smaller than the input heating power. The rest of the heat energy supplied is wasted as heat to the ambient surroundings. The thermal efficiency therefore has a maximum, given by the Carnot efficiency, which is always less than one.
# The efficiency of real heat engines is even lower than the Carnot efficiency due to irreversibility arising from the speed of processes, including friction.

Statements 2 and 3 apply to heat engines. Other types of engines that convert e.g. mechanical into electromagnetic energy, cannot operate with 100% efficiency, because it is impossible to design any system that is free of energy dissipation.

Machines that comply with both laws of thermodynamics by accessing energy from unconventional sources are sometimes referred to as perpetual motion machines, although they do not meet the standard criteria for the name. By way of example, clocks and other low-power machines, such as Cox&#x27;s timepiece, have been designed to run on the differences in barometric pressure or temperature between night and day. These machines have a source of energy, albeit one which is not readily apparent, so that they only seem to violate the laws of thermodynamics.

Even machines that extract energy from long-lived sources - such as ocean currents - will run down when their energy sources inevitably do. They are not perpetual motion machines because they are consuming energy from an external source and are not isolated systems.

=== Classification ===
One classification of perpetual motion machines refers to the particular law of thermodynamics the machines purport to violate:
* A perpetual motion machine of the first kind produces work without the input of energy. It thus violates the law of conservation of energy.
* A perpetual motion machine of the second kind is a machine that spontaneously converts thermal energy into mechanical work. When the thermal energy is equivalent to the work done, this does not violate the law of conservation of energy. However, it does violate the more subtle second law of thermodynamics in a cyclic process (see also entropy). The signature of a perpetual motion machine of the second kind is that there is only one heat reservoir involved, which is being spontaneously cooled without involving a transfer of heat to a cooler reservoir. This conversion of heat into useful work, without any side effect, is impossible, according to the second law of thermodynamics.
*A perpetual motion machine of the third kind is defined as one that completely eliminates friction and other dissipative forces, to maintain motion forever due to its mass inertia (&quot;third&quot; in this case refers solely to the position in the above classification scheme, not the third law of thermodynamics). It is impossible to make such a machine, as dissipation can never be completely eliminated in a mechanical system, no matter how close a system gets to this ideal (see examples at below).

=== Impossibility ===
&quot;Epistemic impossibility&quot; describes things which absolutely cannot occur within our &quot;current&quot; formulation of the physical laws. This interpretation of the word &quot;impossible&quot; is what is intended in discussions of the impossibility of perpetual motion in a closed system.

The conservation laws are particularly robust from a mathematical perspective. Noether&#x27;s theorem, which was proven mathematically in 1915, states that any conservation law can be derived from a corresponding continuous symmetry of the action of a physical system. The symmetry which is equivalent to conservation of energy is the time invariance of physical laws. Therefore, if the laws of physics do not change with time, then the conservation of energy follows. For energy conservation to be violated to allow perpetual motion would require that the foundations of physics would change.

Scientific investigations as to whether the laws of physics are invariant over time use telescopes to examine the universe in the distant past to discover, to the limits of our measurements, whether ancient stars were identical to stars today. Combining different measurements such as spectroscopy, direct measurement of the speed of light in the past and similar measurements demonstrates that physics has remained substantially the same, if not identical, for all of observable time spanning billions of years.

The principles of thermodynamics are so well established, both theoretically and experimentally, that proposals for perpetual motion machines are universally dismissed by physicists. Any proposed perpetual motion design offers a potentially instructive challenge to physicists: one is certain that it cannot work, so one must explain &quot;how&quot; it fails to work. The difficulty (and the value) of such an exercise depends on the subtlety of the proposal; the best ones tend to arise from physicists&#x27; own thought experiments and often shed light upon certain aspects of physics. So, for example, the thought experiment of a Brownian ratchet as a perpetual motion machine was first discussed by Gabriel Lippmann in 1900 but it was not until 1912 that Marian Smoluchowski gave an adequate explanation for why it cannot work. However, during that twelve-year period scientists did not believe that the machine was possible. They were merely unaware of the exact mechanism by which it would inevitably fail.

In the mid-19th-century Henry Dircks investigated the history of perpetual motion experiments, writing a vitriolic attack on those who continued to attempt what he believed to be impossible:

=== Techniques ===

Some common ideas recur repeatedly in perpetual motion machine designs. Many ideas that continue to appear today were stated as early as 1670 by John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester and an official of the Royal Society. He outlined three potential sources of power for a perpetual motion machine, &quot; Extractions&quot;, &quot;Magnetical Virtues&quot; and &quot;the Natural Affection of Gravity&quot;.

The seemingly mysterious ability of magnets to influence motion at a distance without any apparent energy source has long appealed to inventors. One of the earliest examples of a magnetic motor was proposed by Wilkins and has been widely copied since: it consists of a ramp with a magnet at the top, which pulled a metal ball up the ramp. Near the magnet was a small hole that was supposed to allow the ball to drop under the ramp and return to the bottom, where a flap allowed it to return to the top again. However, if the magnet is to be strong enough to pull the ball up the ramp, it cannot then be weak enough to allow gravity to pull it through the hole. Faced with this problem, more modern versions typically use a series of ramps and magnets, positioned so the ball is to be handed off from one magnet to another as it moves. The problem remains the same.


Gravity also acts at a distance, without an apparent energy source, but to get energy out of a gravitational field (for instance, by dropping a heavy object, producing kinetic energy as it falls) one has to put energy in (for instance, by lifting the object up), and some energy is always dissipated in the process. A typical application of gravity in a perpetual motion machine is Bhaskara&#x27;s wheel in the 12th century, whose key idea is itself a recurring theme, often called the overbalanced wheel: moving weights are attached to a wheel in such a way that they fall to a position further from the wheel&#x27;s center for one half of the wheel&#x27;s rotation, and closer to the center for the other half. Since weights further from the center apply a greater torque, it was thought that the wheel would rotate forever. However, since the side with weights further from the center has fewer weights than the other side, at that moment, the torque is balanced and perpetual movement is not achieved. The moving weights may be hammers on pivoted arms, or rolling balls, or mercury in tubes; the principle is the same.
Another theoretical machine involves a frictionless environment for motion. This involves the use of diamagnetic or electromagnetic levitation to float an object. This is done in a vacuum to eliminate air friction and friction from an axle. The levitated object is then free to rotate around its center of gravity without interference. However, this machine has no practical purpose because the rotated object cannot do any work as work requires the levitated object to cause motion in other objects, bringing friction into the problem. Furthermore, a &quot;perfect&quot; vacuum is an unattainable goal since both the container and the object itself would slowly vaporize, thereby degrading the vacuum.

To extract work from heat, thus producing a perpetual motion machine of the second kind, the most common approach (dating back at least to Maxwell&#x27;s demon) is &quot;unidirectionality&quot;. Only molecules moving fast enough and in the right direction are allowed through the demon&#x27;s trap door. In a Brownian ratchet, forces tending to turn the ratchet one way are able to do so while forces in the other direction are not. A diode in a heat bath allows through currents in one direction and not the other. These schemes typically fail in two ways: either maintaining the unidirectionality costs energy (requiring Maxwell&#x27;s demon to perform more thermodynamic work to gauge the speed of the molecules than the amount of energy gained by the difference of temperature caused) or the unidirectionality is an illusion and occasional big violations make up for the frequent small non-violations (the Brownian ratchet will be subject to internal Brownian forces and therefore will sometimes turn the wrong way).
Buoyancy is another frequently misunderstood phenomenon. Some proposed perpetual-motion machines miss the fact that to push a volume of air down in a fluid takes the same work as to raise a corresponding volume of fluid up against gravity. These types of machines may involve two chambers with pistons, and a mechanism to squeeze the air out of the top chamber into the bottom one, which then becomes buoyant and floats to the top. The squeezing mechanism in these designs would not be able to do enough work to move the air down, or would leave no excess work available to be extracted.

== Patents ==
Proposals for such inoperable machines have become so common that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has made an official policy of refusing to grant patents for perpetual motion machines without a working model. The USPTO Manual of Patent Examining Practice states:

And, further, that:
The filing of a patent application is a clerical task, and the USPTO will not refuse filings for perpetual motion machines; the application will be filed and then most probably rejected by the patent examiner, after he has done a formal examination. Even if a patent is granted, it does not mean that the invention actually works, it just means that the examiner believes that it works, or was unable to figure out why it would not work.

The United Kingdom Patent Office has a specific practice on perpetual motion; Section 4.05 of the UKPO Manual of Patent Practice states:

Examples of decisions by the UK Patent Office to refuse patent applications for perpetual motion machines include:
* Decision BL O/044/06, John Frederick Willmott&#x27;s application no. 0502841
* Decision BL O/150/06, Ezra Shimshi&#x27;s application no. 0417271

The European Patent Classification (ECLA) has classes including patent applications on perpetual motion systems: ECLA classes &quot;F03B17/04: Alleged perpetua mobilia&quot; and &quot;F03B17/00B: [... machines or engines] (with closed loop circulation or similar : ... Installations wherein the liquid circulates in a closed loop; Alleged perpetua mobilia of this or similar kind&quot;.

== Apparent perpetual motion machines ==
As a perpetual motion machine can only be defined in a finite isolated system with discrete parameters, and since true isolated systems do not exist (among other things, due to quantum uncertainty), &quot;perpetual motion&quot; in the context of this article is better defined as a &quot;perpetual motion machine&quot;, since a machine is a &quot;a mechanically, electrically, or electronically operated device for performing a task&quot;, whereas &quot;motion&quot; is simply movement (such as Brownian motion). Distinctions aside, on the macro scale, there are concepts and technical drafts that propose &quot;perpetual motion&quot;, but on closer analysis it is revealed that they actually &quot;consume&quot; some sort of natural resource or latent energy, such as the phase changes of water or other fluids or small natural temperature gradients, or simply cannot sustain indefinite operation. In general, extracting work from these devices is impossible.

=== Resource consuming ===
Some examples of such devices include:
* The drinking bird toy functions using small ambient temperature gradients and evaporation. It runs until all water is evaporated.
* A capillary action-based water pump functions using small ambient temperature gradients and vapour pressure differences. With the &quot;capillary bowl&quot;, it was thought that the capillary action would keep the water flowing in the tube, but since the cohesion force that draws the liquid up the tube in the first place holds the droplet from releasing into the bowl, the flow is not perpetual.
* A Crookes radiometer consists of a partial vacuum glass container with a lightweight propeller moved by (light-induced) temperature gradients.
* Any device picking up minimal amounts of energy from the natural electromagnetic radiation around it, such as a solar-powered motor.
* Any device powered by changes in air pressure, such as some clocks (Cox&#x27;s timepiece, Beverly Clock). The motion leeches energy from moving air which in turn gained its energy from being acted on.
* A heat pump, due to it having a COP above 1: the energy it consumes as work is less than the energy it moves as heat.
* The Atmos clock uses changes in the vapor pressure of ethyl chloride with temperature to wind the clock spring.
* A device powered by induced nuclear reactions or by radioactive decay from an isotope with a relatively long half-life; such a device could plausibly operate for hundreds or thousands of years.
* The Oxford Electric Bell and the are driven by dry pile batteries.

=== Low friction ===
* In flywheel energy storage, &quot;modern flywheels can have a zero-load rundown time measurable in years&quot;.
* Once spun up, objects in the vacuum of space—stars, black holes, planets, moons, spin-stabilized satellites, etc.—dissipate energy very slowly, allowing them to spin for long periods. Tides on Earth are dissipating the gravitational energy of the Moon/Earth system at an average rate of about 3.75 terawatts.
* In certain quantum-mechanical systems (such as superfluidity and superconductivity), very low friction movement is possible. However, the motion stops when the system reaches an equilibrium state (e.g. all the liquid helium arrives at the same level). Similarly, seemingly entropy-reversing effects like superfluids climbing the walls of containers operate by ordinary capillary action.

=== Thought experiments ===
In some cases a thought experiment appears to suggest that perpetual motion may be possible through accepted and understood physical processes. However, in all cases, a flaw has been found when all of the relevant physics is considered. Examples include:
* Maxwell&#x27;s demon: This was originally proposed to show that the second law of thermodynamics applied in the statistical sense only, by postulating a &quot;demon&quot; that could select energetic molecules and extract their energy. Subsequent analysis (and experiment) have shown there is no way to physically implement such a system that does not result in an overall increase in entropy.
* Brownian ratchet: In this thought experiment, one imagines a paddle wheel connected to a ratchet. Brownian motion would cause surrounding gas molecules to strike the paddles, but the ratchet would only allow it to turn in one direction. A more thorough analysis showed that when a physical ratchet was considered at this molecular scale, Brownian motion would also affect the ratchet and cause it to randomly fail resulting in no net gain. Thus, the device would not violate the laws of thermodynamics.
* Vacuum energy and zero-point energy: In order to explain effects such as virtual particles and the Casimir effect, many formulations of quantum physics include a background energy which pervades empty space, known as vacuum or zero-point energy. The ability to harness zero-point energy for useful work is considered pseudoscience by the scientific community at large. Inventors have proposed various methods for extracting useful work from zero-point energy, but none have been found to be viable, no claims for extraction of zero-point energy have ever been validated by the scientific community, and there is no evidence that zero-point energy can be used in violation of conservation of energy.
*Ellipsoid paradox: This paradox considers a perfectly reflecting cavity with two black bodies at points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. The reflecting surface is composed of two elliptical sections &quot;E&quot;1 and &quot;E&quot;2 and a spherical section &quot;S&quot;, and the bodies at &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are located at the joint foci of the two ellipses and &quot;B&quot; is at the center of &quot;S&quot;. This configuration is such that apparently black body at &quot;B&quot; heat up relative to &quot;A&quot;: the radiation originating from the blackbody at &quot;A&quot; will land on and be absorbed by the blackbody at &quot;B&quot;. Similarly, rays originating from point &quot;B&quot; that land on &quot;E&quot;1 and &quot;E&quot;2 will be reflected to &quot;A&quot;. However, a significant proportion of rays that start from &quot;B&quot; will land on &quot;S&quot; will be reflected back to &quot;B&quot;. This paradox is solved when the black bodies&#x27; finite sizes are considered instead of punctual black bodies.
== Conspiracy theories ==

Despite being dismissed as pseudoscientific, perpetual motion machines have become the focus of conspiracy theories, alleging that they are being hidden from the public by corporations or governments, who would lose economic control if a power source capable of producing energy cheaply was made available.

<text>Robert Ludlum (May 25, 1927 – March 12, 2001) was an American author of 27 thriller novels, best known as the creator of Jason Bourne from the original &quot;The Bourne Trilogy&quot; series. The number of copies of his books in print is estimated between 300 million and 500 million. They have been published in 33 languages and 40 countries. Ludlum also published books under the pseudonyms Jonathan Ryder and Michael Shepherd.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Ludlum was born in New York City, the son of Margaret (née Wadsworth) and George Hartford Ludlum. He was educated at the Rectory School then Cheshire Academy and Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he earned a B.A. in Drama in 1951. 

===Career===
Prior to becoming an author, he had been a United States Marine, a theatrical actor and producer. In the 1950s, he produced shows at the Grant Lee theater in Fort Lee, New Jersey. From 1960 to 1970, he managed and produced shows at the Playhouse on the Mall at Bergen Mall in Paramus, New Jersey. His theatrical experience may have contributed to his understanding of the energy, escapism and action that the public wanted in a novel. He once remarked: &quot;I equate suspense and good theater in a very similar way. I think it&#x27;s all suspense and what-happens-next. From that point of view, yes, I guess, I am theatrical.&quot;

Many of Ludlum&#x27;s novels have been made into films and mini-series, including &quot;The Osterman Weekend&quot;, &quot;The Holcroft Covenant&quot;, &quot;The Apocalypse Watch&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; and &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;. &quot;Covert One: The Hades Factor&quot;, a book co-written with Gayle Lynds, was originally conceived as a mini-series; the book evolved from a short treatment Ludlum wrote for NBC. The Bourne movies, starring Matt Damon in the title role, have been commercially and critically successful (&quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; won three Academy Awards in 2008), although the story lines depart significantly from the source material.

During the 1970s, Ludlum lived in Leonia, New Jersey, where he spent hours each day writing at his home.

===Death===
Ludlum died of a heart attack on March 12, 2001, at his home in Naples, Florida, while recovering from severe burns caused by a mysterious fire which occurred on February 10, 2001.

In 2005, the company which held all merchandising rights for Ludlum&#x27;s works via his estate, Ludlum Entertainment, signed an agreement with Vivendi Universal Games to handle video game rights for ten years. The license expired in 2008. On November 20, 2008, the Ludlum estate signed a deal with Universal Pictures to develop feature films based on the works of Robert Ludlum. On February 2, 2009, his estate transferred video game rights to Ludlum’s work to Electronic Arts after Activision took over Vivendi Games&#x27; assets.

==Writing analysis==
Ludlum&#x27;s novels typically feature one heroic man, or a small group of crusading individuals, in a struggle against powerful adversaries whose intentions and motivations are evil and who are capable of using political and economic mechanisms in frightening ways. The world in his writings is one where global corporations, shadowy military forces and government organizations all conspired to preserve (if it was evil) or undermine (if it was law-abiding) the status quo.

Ludlum&#x27;s novels were often inspired by conspiracy theories, both historical and contemporary. He wrote that &quot;The Matarese Circle&quot; was inspired by rumors about the Trilateral Commission, and it was published only a few years after the commission was founded. His depictions of terrorism in books such as &quot;The Holcroft Covenant&quot; and &quot;The Matarese Circle&quot; reflected the theory that terrorists, rather than being merely isolated bands of ideologically or politically motivated extremists, are actually pawns of governments or private organizations who are using them to facilitate the establishment of authoritarian rule.

==Bibliography==
==Filmography==
Many of Ludlum&#x27;s novels have been made into films and miniseries, although the storylines might depart significantly from the source material. In general, a miniseries is more faithful to the original novel on which it is based. Adaptations of Ludlum&#x27;s works are published under the trademark Treadstone, which is held by the executor of the Robert Ludlum estate.

<text>Gentianales is an order of flowering plant, included within the asterid clade of eudicots. It comprises more than 20,000 species in about 1,200 genera in 5 families. More than 80% of the species in this order belong to the family Rubiaceae.

Many of these flowering plants are used in traditional medicine. They have been used to treat pain, anxiety, cancers and neurological conditions.

According to molecular clock calculations, the lineage that led to Gentianales split from other plants about 108 million years ago or 81 million years ago.

==Taxonomy==
In the classification system of Dahlgren the Gentiales were in the superorder Gentianiflorae (also called Gentiananae). The following families are included according to the APG III system:
* Family Apocynaceae (424 genera)
* Family Gelsemiaceae (2 genera)
* Family Gentianaceae (87 genera)
* Family Loganiaceae (13 genera)
* Family Rubiaceae (611 genera)

===Phylogeny===
The following phylogenetic tree is based on molecular phylogenetic studies of DNA sequences.

===Etymology===
It takes its name from the family Gentianaceae, which in turn is based on the name of the type genus, &quot;Gentiana&quot;. The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king.

== Characteristics ==
This large order has a variety of different plants, ranging from small herbaceous plants and saprophytes to shrubs and large trees. Species are, however, united by their simple and opposite leaves and typically have showy pentamerous flowers (flowers in which components occur in multiples of five) and show nuclear endosperm formation (in which cell division takes place without the cell wall forming between divisions). Many species have structures between the leaf petioles, such as ridges or stipules. Many species also have colleters; thick hair-like structures that secrete mucilage, a thick gluey substance.

== Distribution ==
Species of this order are found in moist climates around the world. They are most common in tropical regions.

==Uses==
Many gentianales contain toxic compounds and species have a variety of uses. Some species are also grown ornamentally. Well-known members of Gentianales are coffee, frangipani, &quot;Gardenia&quot;, gentian, oleander, and periwinkle.

Certain species belonging to the order Gentianales have been used in traditional medicine in rural southeastern Asia countries. &quot;Gelsemium sempervirens&quot; has been used in North American folk medicine to treat conditions such as anxiety, migraines/headaches, and neuralgia, while &quot;Gelsemium elegans&quot; has been used in China to treat rheumatoid arthritis pain, neuropathic pain, skin ulcers, and even cancers.

The compounds found in some species are used in the synthesis of modern medicines. Cinchona trees, for example, are a source of quinine, which is used to treat malaria. Vinblastine, which has anti-tumor properties as it disrupts cell division, is used in chemotherapy. It is extracted from the Madagascar periwinkle.

<doc id="54081" wikidata="Q148737" url="?curid=54081" title="Maloideae">
<text>The Maloideae was the apple subfamily, a grouping used by some taxonomists within the rose family, Rosaceae. Recent molecular phylogenetic evidence has shown that the traditional Spiraeoideae and Amygdaloideae form part of the same clade as the traditional Maloideae, and the correct name for this group is [[Amygdaloideae]]. Earlier circumscriptions of Maloideae are more-or-less equivalent to subtribe Malinae or to tribe Maleae. The group includes a number of plants bearing commercially important fruits, such as apples and pears, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.

In its traditional circumscription this subfamily consisted exclusively of shrubs and small trees characterised by a pome, a type of accessory fruit that does not occur in other Rosaceae, and by a basal haploid chromosome count of 17 (instead of 7, 8, or 9 as in the other Rosaceae), involving approximately 28 genera with approximately 1100 species worldwide, with most species occurring in the temperate Northern Hemisphere.

== Taxonomy ==
The subfamily was given the name Pomoideae Juss. in 1789, but this name is no longer accepted under the nomenclature codes because it is not based on a genus name. It has also been separated into its own family the Malaceae Small (formerly Pomaceae Lindl.).

An earlier intermediate classification expanded Maloideae to include four genera with dry non-pome fruit. These are &quot;Kageneckia&quot;, &quot;Lindleya&quot;, and &quot;Vauquelinia&quot;, which have a haploid chromosome count of 15 or 17, and &quot;Gillenia&quot;, which is herbaceous and has a haploid chromosome count of 9.

A traditional circumscription of Maloideae includes the following genera:
* &quot;Amelanchier&quot; – serviceberry, juneberry
* &quot;Aria&quot; (see &quot;Sorbus&quot;)
* &quot;Aronia&quot; – chokeberry
* &quot;Chaenomeles&quot; – Japanese quince
* &quot;Chamaemeles&quot;
* &quot;Chamaemespilus&quot; (see &quot;Sorbus chamaemespilus&quot;)
* &quot;Cormus&quot; (see &quot;Sorbus&quot;)
* &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; – cotoneaster
* &quot;Crataegus&quot; – hawthorn
* &quot;Cydonia&quot; – quince
* &quot;Dichotomanthes&quot;
* &quot;Docynia&quot;
* &quot;Docyniopsis&quot;
* &quot;Eriobotrya&quot; – loquat
* &quot;Eriolobus&quot;
* &quot;Hesperomeles&quot;
* &quot;Heteromeles&quot; – toyon
* &quot;Malacomeles&quot;
* &quot;Malus&quot; – apple, crabapple
* &quot;Mespilus&quot; – medlar
* &quot;Osteomeles&quot;
* &quot;Peraphyllum&quot;
* &quot;Photinia&quot;
* &quot;Pseudocydonia&quot; – Chinese quince
* &quot;Pyracantha&quot; – firethorn
* &quot;Pyrus&quot; – pear
* &quot;Rhaphiolepis&quot; – hawthorn
* &quot;Sorbus&quot; – rowan, whitebeam, service tree
* &quot;Stranvaesia&quot; = &quot;Photinia&quot; pro parte
* &quot;Torminalis&quot; (see &quot;Sorbus torminalis&quot;)

Intergeneric hybrids:
* &quot;× Amelasorbus&quot;
* &quot;× Crataegosorbus&quot;
* &quot;× Crataemespilus&quot;
* &quot;× Malosorbus&quot;
* &quot;× Sorbocotoneaster&quot;
* &quot;× Sorbopyrus&quot;

<text>Amygdaloideae is a subfamily within the flowering plant family Rosaceae. It was formerly considered by some authors to be separate from Rosaceae, and the family names Prunaceae and Amygdalaceae have been used. Reanalysis from 2007 has shown that the previous definition of subfamily Spiraeoideae was paraphyletic. To solve this problem, a larger subfamily was defined that includes the former Amygdaloideae, Spiraeoideae, and Maloideae. This subfamily, however, is to be called Amygdaloideae rather than Spiraeoideae under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants as updated in 2011.

As traditionally defined, the Amygdaloideae includes such commercially important crops as plum, cherry, apricot, peach, and almond. The fruit of these plants are known as stone fruit (drupes), as each fruit contains a hard shell (the endocarp) called a &quot;stone&quot; or &quot;pit&quot;, which contains the single seed.

The expanded definition of the Amygdaloideae adds to these commercially important crops such as apples and pears that have pome fruit, and also important ornamental plants such as &quot;Spiraea&quot; and &quot;Aruncus&quot; that have hard dry fruits.

==Taxonomic history==
The name Prunoideae is sometimes used, but is incorrect. The 1835 publication of that name by Gilbert Thomas Burnett (Burnett) is invalid because it lacks a description (or diagnosis or reference to an earlier description or diagnosis). Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow (Horan.) published the name in 1847, but Amygdaloideae, published in 1832 by George Arnott Walker-Arnott, has priority and is therefore the correct name.

The taxonomy of this group of plants within the Rosaceae has recently been unclear. In 2001 it was reported that Amygdaloideae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; consists of two distinct genetic groups or &quot;clades&quot;, &quot;Prunus&quot;–&quot;Maddenia&quot; and &quot;Exochorda&quot;–&quot;Oemleria&quot;–&quot;Prinsepia&quot;. Further refinement shows that &quot;Exochorda&quot;–&quot;Oemleria&quot;–&quot;Prinsepia&quot; is somewhat separate from &quot;Prunus&quot;–&quot;Maddenia&quot;–&quot;Pygeum&quot;, and that the traditional subfamilies Maloideae and Spiraeoideae must be included in Amygdaloideae if a paraphyletic group is to be avoided. With this classification, the genus &quot;Prunus&quot; is considered to include &quot;Armeniaca&quot;, &quot;Cerasus&quot;, &quot;Amygdalus&quot;, &quot;Padus&quot;, &quot;Laurocerasus&quot;, &quot;Pygeum&quot;, and &quot;Maddenia&quot;.

Robert Frost alluded to the merging of Amygdalaceae into Rosaceae in his poem &quot;The Rose Family&quot;, when he wrote &quot;The rose is a rose and was always a rose / But the theory now goes that the apple&#x27;s a rose, / and the pear is, and &quot;so&#x27;s the plum, I suppose&quot;.&quot; In the next line he wrote, &quot;The dear [i.e., &quot;the dear Lord&quot;, euphemized] only knows what will next prove a rose.&quot; This referred to shifting botanical opinion which had recently reunited Amygdalaceae, Spiraeaceae, and Malaceae into Rosaceae (which matches de Jussieu&#x27;s 1789 classification).

<text>Leonard Cyril Deighton ( ; born 18 February 1929) is a British author. His publications have included cookery books and works on history, but he is best known for his spy novels.

After completing his national service in the Royal Air Force, Deighton attended the Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art and the Royal College of Art in London; he graduated from the latter in 1955. He had several jobs before becoming a book and magazine illustrator and designed the cover for the first UK edition of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s 1957 work &quot;On the Road&quot;. He also worked for a period in an advertising agency. During an extended holiday in France he wrote his first novel, &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot;, which was published in 1962 and was a critical and commercial success. He wrote several spy novels featuring the same central character, an unnamed working-class intelligence officer, cynical and tough. Between 1962 and 1966 Deighton was the food correspondent for &quot;The Observer&quot; and drew cookstrips—black-and-white graphic recipes with a limited number of words. A selection of these was collected and published in 1965 as &quot;Len Deighton&#x27;s Action Cook Book&quot;, the first of five cookery books he wrote. Other topics of non-fiction include military history.

Many of Deighton&#x27;s books have been best-sellers and he has been favourably compared both to his contemporary John le Carré and his literary antecedents W. Somerset Maugham, Eric Ambler, Ian Fleming and Graham Greene. Deighton&#x27;s fictional work is marked by a complex narrative structure, extensive research and an air of verisimilitude.

Several of Deighton&#x27;s works have been adapted for film and radio. Films include &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965), &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1966), &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967) and &quot;Spy Story&quot; (1976). In 1988 Granada Television produced the miniseries &quot;Game, Set and Match&quot; based on his trilogy of the same name, and in 1995 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a real-time dramatisation of his 1970 novel &quot;Bomber&quot;.
==Biography==
===Early life and early career: 1929–1961===
Leonard Cyril Deighton was born in Marylebone, London, on 18 February 1929. His birth was in the infirmary of a workhouse as the local hospital was full. His father was the chauffeur and mechanic for Campbell Dodgson, the Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum; Deighton&#x27;s mother was a part-time cook. At the time the family lived in Gloucester Place Mews near Baker Street. In 1940, during the Second World War, the eleven-year-old Deighton witnessed the arrest of Anna Wolkoff, a British subject of Russian descent for whom his mother cooked; Wolkoff was detained as a Nazi spy and charged with stealing correspondence between Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Deighton said that observing her arrest was &quot;a major factor in my decision to write a spy story at my first attempt at fiction&quot;.

Deighton was educated at St Marylebone Grammar and William Ellis schools, but was moved to an emergency school for part of the Second World War. After leaving school Deighton worked as a railway clerk before being conscripted for national service at the age of 17, which he completed with the Royal Air Force (RAF). While in the RAF he was trained as a photographer, often recording crime scenes with the Special Investigation Branch (SIB) of the military police as part of his duties. During his work with the SIB he learned to fly and became an experienced scuba diver.

After two-and-a-half years with the RAF, Deighton received a demobilisation grant, enabling him to study at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art where he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art; he graduated from the college in 1955. While studying he held a temporary job in 1951 as a pastry chef at the Royal Festival Hall. He worked as a flight attendant for British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) between 1956 and 1957 before becoming a professional illustrator. Much of his work as an illustrator was in advertising—he worked for agencies in New York and London—but he also illustrated magazines and over 200 book covers, including for the first UK edition of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s 1957 work &quot;On the Road&quot;.

===Writing career: 1961–===

While he was working at the Royal Festival Hall, Deighton would make sketches to remember some of the steps he took preparing dishes. He developed the idea into the concept of the &quot;cookstrip&quot;, a full recipe within a cartoon-style illustration. Following the publication of one of Deighton&#x27;s cookstrips in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in 1961, &quot;The Observer&quot; commissioned him to provide a weekly series for its own magazine, which he did between March 1962 and August 1966. He later explained:

I was buying expensive cookbooks. I&#x27;m very messy, and didn&#x27;t want to take them into the kitchen. So I wrote out the recipes on paper, and it was easier for me to draw three eggs than write &#x27;three eggs&#x27;. So I drew three eggs, then put in an arrow. For me it was a natural way to work.

In 1962 Deighton&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot;, was published; it had been written in 1960 while he was staying in the Dordogne, south west France. The book was soon a commercial success and was a best-seller in the UK, France and the US, selling more than 2.5 million copies in three years. The story—written as a first-person narrative—introduced a working-class protagonist, cynical and tough. Deighton did not want to invent a name for the character and later explained &quot;Some people felt that a contrivance, but I kept putting off inventing a name for him until I got to the end of the book and realised I could finish the book without giving him a name&quot;.

In 2017 Deighton described how he did not consider the character an anti-hero, but &quot;a romantic, incorruptible figure in the mould of Philip Marlowe&quot;. Deighton described the inspiration of using a working-class spy among the Oxbridge-educated members of the Establishment as coming from his time at the advertising agency, when he was the only member of the company&#x27;s board not to have been educated at Eton. He said &quot;&quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; is about spies on the surface, but it&#x27;s also really about a grammar school boy among public school boys and the difficulties he faces.&quot;

Deighton published two further novels with his unnamed protagonist—&quot;Horse Under Water&quot; (1963) and &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1964). &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; stayed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list for twenty weeks and sold over forty thousand copies in hardback in 1965. He published two cookbooks in 1965, &quot;Len Deighton&#x27;s Action Cook Book&quot; (a collection of his cookstrips from &quot;The Observer&quot;) and (Where is the garlic), a collection of French recipes. They also sold well, making Deighton a best-selling author in two genres. Two further novels in the spy series followed—&quot;Billion-Dollar Brain&quot; (1966) and &quot;An Expensive Place to Die&quot; (1967)—after which he published his first historical non-fiction work, &quot;The Assassination of President Kennedy&quot; (1967), co-written with Michael Rand and Howard Loxton. During 1967 he also edited and contributed to &quot;Len Deighton&#x27;s London Dossier&quot;, a work that described itself as &quot;a real London guidebook&quot;. The book suggested the Rowton Houses owned by Rowton Hotels Ltd were doss-houses for the homeless. He and the publishers Jonathan Cape were sued for libel; they apologised, withdrew the suggestions made in the book by amending the claim in unsold editions and paid substantial damages.

In September 1967 he wrote an article in &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; about Operation Snowdrop, an SAS attack on Benghazi during the Second World War. Deighton wrote that the raid &quot;suffered a lack of security&quot; because David Stirling, the leader of the raid, &quot;had insisted upon talking about the raid during two social gatherings at the British Embassy in Cairo although warned not to do so&quot;. Stirling sued Deighton and Times Newspapers for libel the following year as the implication was that his indiscretion had endangered the lives of his men. Stirling explained in court that one of the social gatherings was a dinner with Winston Churchill, Field Marshal Jan Smuts, General Sir Alan Brooke, General Sir Claude Auchinleck and General Harold Alexander; the second occasion was a private conversation with Churchill. Deighton and Times Newspapers apologised, published a correction and paid damages.

During the mid-1960s Deighton wrote for &quot;Playboy&quot; as a travel correspondent, and he provided a piece on the boom in spy fiction; &quot;An Expensive Place to Die&quot; was serialised in the magazine in 1967. In 1968 Deighton was the producer of the film &quot;Only When I Larf&quot;, which was based on his novel of the same name. He was the writer and co-producer of &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; in 1969, but did not enjoy the process of making films, and had his name removed from the film&#x27;s credits. In 1970 Deighton wrote &quot;Bomber&quot;, a fictional account of an RAF Bomber Command raid that goes wrong. To produce the novel he used an IBM MT/ST, and it is possible that this was the first novel to be written using a word processor. Deighton was interviewed on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in June 1976 by Roy Plomley.

Deighton wrote &quot;&quot;, published in 1977, after being advised to do so by the historian A. J. P. Taylor. The book was well received by readers and reviewers, although the inclusion of interviews with German participants led to criticism from some. Taylor wrote the introduction for the book, describing it as a &quot;brilliant analysis&quot;; Albert Speer, once the Minister of Armaments for Adolf Hitler, thought it &quot;an excellent, most thorough examination&quot;.

&quot;Fighter&quot; was followed in 1978 by another novel, &quot;SS-GB&quot;, the idea for which came from Ray Hawkey, Deighton&#x27;s friend from art school and the designer of the covers of several of his books. While the two were discussing what would have happened if the Germans had won the Second World War, Hawkey asked Deighton if he thought there could be an alternative history novel. &quot;&quot;, Deighton&#x27;s 1979 history of the rise of the Nazis and the fall of France, has a foreword written by General Walther Nehring, Chief of Staff to General Heinz Guderian. As at 2023 his last history book is &quot;Blood, Tears and Folly: An Objective Look at World War II&quot; (1993), which examined the events of the war up until 1942. Reviewing for &quot;The Times&quot;, Henry Stanhope considers the work &quot;extremely readable&quot;, although he questions the structure of the book which focuses on different theatres of war, rather than using a purely chronological history. This approach, Stanhope considers, &quot;presents a less complete picture to the reader&quot;. The historian Allan R. Millett considers that the book would have been improved by wider research into the Russian, Japanese and American aspects of the war.

Beginning in 1983 Deighton wrote three connected trilogies: &quot;Berlin Game&quot; (1983), &quot;Mexico Set&quot; (1984) and &quot;London Match&quot; (1985); &quot;Spy Hook&quot; (1988), &quot;Spy Line&quot; (1989) and &quot;Spy Sinker&quot; (1990); and &quot;Faith&quot; (1994), &quot;Hope&quot; (1995) and &quot;Charity&quot; (1996). &quot;Winter&quot;, a companion novel dealing with the lives of a German family from 1899 to 1945, which also provides an historical background to several of the characters from the trilogies, was published in 1987. The trilogies are centred on Bernard Samson, a tough, cynical and disrespectful MI6 intelligence officer.

===Personal life===
Deighton married the illustrator Shirley Thompson in 1960; the couple were divorced in 1976, having not lived together for over five years. He left Britain in 1969, and has lived abroad since, including in Ireland, Austria, France, the US and Portugal. He lived for a while in Blackrock, County Louth, where he married Ysabele in February 1980, the daughter of a Dutch diplomat. The couple have two sons.

Deighton does not like giving interviews, and these have been rare throughout his life; he also avoids appearing at literary festivals. He says that he does not enjoy being a writer and that &quot;The best thing about writing books is being at a party and telling some pretty girl you write books, the worst thing is sitting at a typewriter and actually writing the book.&quot; After completing &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Charity&quot; in 1996, he decided to take a year off writing; at the end of the period, he decided that writing was &quot;a &quot; that he did not miss and did not have to do. By 2016 Deighton had retired from writing.

==Works==
According to the Gale &quot;Contemporary Novelists&quot; monographs, Deighton and fellow author John le Carré follow in the same literary tradition of British espionage writers as W. Somerset Maugham, Eric Ambler and Graham Greene. Deighton provides an &quot;energetic style&quot; and his fictional work is marked by a complex narrative structure, according to Gale. Deighton extensively researched the background and technical aspects of his storylines, and enjoyed this side of producing work; in 1976 he said &quot;I like the research better than I like writing books&quot;. The literary analyst Gina Macdonald observes that the technical aspect of Deighton&#x27;s work can overshadow the plots and characterisation in the novel when Deighton provides too much detail in a short passage, leading to what she calls &quot;banal conversations, stilted and unconvincing&quot;. Deighton was elected to the Detection Club in 1969 and their work &quot;Howdunit&quot;, published in 2020, was dedicated to him.

===Novels===
According to the film and media historian Alan Burton, &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot;—along with le Carré&#x27;s 1963 novel &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;—&quot;changed the nature of British spy fiction&quot; as it brought in &quot;a more insolent, disillusioned and cynical style to the espionage story&quot;. The novel used appendices and footnotes which, according to Burton, gave verisimilitude to the work. The academic George Grella considers Deighton&#x27;s novels to be &quot;stylish, witty [and] well-crafted&quot;, and that they provide &quot;a convincingly detailed picture of the world of espionage while carefully examining the ethics and morality of that world&quot;. Deighton has expressed his admiration for the police procedural, which he considers has an authentic feel, and approaches his fiction writing as a &quot;spy procedural&quot;. Burton considers &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; to be &quot;a marker of a new trend in mature, realistic espionage fiction&quot;.

&quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; appeared in bookshops at the same time as the James Bond film &quot;Dr. No&quot;. Deighton acknowledged that his career had benefited from the enormous popularity of Bond, although he denied any similarity between his and Ian Fleming&#x27;s books except being about spies. The academic Clive Bloom considers that after &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; was published in 1964, Deighton &quot;established a place for himself ... in the front rank of the spy genre, along with Graham Greene, Ian Fleming and John le Carré&quot;. Deighton&#x27;s later works were less oblique than the earlier ones, and had, according to Bloom, &quot;more subtlety and deeper characterization&quot;. Oliver Buckton, the professor of literature, also considers Deighton to be in the forefront of post-war spy writers. The crime writer and poet Julian Symons writes that &quot;[t]he constant crackle of his dialogue makes Deighton a kind of poet of the spy story&quot;.

Grella considers Deighton to be &quot;the angry young man of the espionage novel&quot;, with the central characters of his main novels—the unnamed protagonist from the &quot;IPCRESS&quot; series and Bernard Samson from the nine novels in which he appears—both working-class, cynical and streetwise, in contrast to the upper-class and ineffective senior members of the intelligence service in their respective novels. His working-class heroes also stand in contrast to Fleming&#x27;s Eton- and Fettes-educated smooth, upper-class character James Bond.

Several of Deighton&#x27;s novels have been adapted as films, which include &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965), &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1966), &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967) and &quot;Spy Story&quot; (1976). All feature the books&#x27; unnamed character, but they were given the full name &quot;Harry Palmer&quot; for the films; either the actor Michael Caine—who played Palmer in the films—or the producer for two of the three films, Harry Saltzman, came up with the name. Two television films also featured Palmer: &quot;Bullet to Beijing&quot; (1995) and &quot;Midnight in Saint Petersburg&quot; (1996); they were not based on Deighton&#x27;s stories. All the films except &quot;Spy Story&quot; feature Caine as Palmer. Deighton&#x27;s hands were used in &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; in place of Caine&#x27;s for a scene in which Palmer breaks eggs into a bowl and whisks them. In March 2022 &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, a television adaptation of Deighton&#x27;s novel, was broadcast on UK television. Joe Cole was Palmer; Lucy Boynton and Tom Hollander also appeared in major roles.

&quot;Berlin Game&quot;, &quot;Mexico Set&quot; and &quot;London Match&quot;, the first trilogy of his Bernard Samson novel series, were made into &quot;Game, Set and Match&quot;, a thirteen-part television series by Granada Television in 1988. Although Quentin Tarantino expressed interest in adapting the trilogy, the project did not materialise. The nine Samson novels were in pre-production with Clerkenwell Films in 2013, with a script by Simon Beaufoy.

In 2017 the BBC adapted Deighton&#x27;s novel &quot;SS-GB&quot; for a five-part miniseries, broadcast in one-hour episodes; Sam Riley played the lead role of Detective Superintendent Douglas Archer. In 1995 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a real-time dramatisation of &quot;Bomber&quot;. The drama was in four broadcasts, each of two hours, from 2:30 pm to midnight, threaded through the station&#x27;s schedule of news and current affairs.

===Legacy and influence===
Deighton&#x27;s work has been acknowledged by the thriller writer Jeremy Duns as being an influence on his own work. In &quot;Letters from Burma&quot;, the politician Aung San Suu Kyi mentions reading Deighton&#x27;s books, while under house arrest. Suu Kyi wrote that she was passionate about Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s tales of Sherlock Holmes and the spy novels of le Carré and Deighton. When asked by Christie&#x27;s about his love for Indian art and how he started his collection, the writer V. S. Naipaul credited Deighton. &quot;I met Len Deighton, the thriller writer, at dinner many years ago. He demonstrated to me that Indian art could really be approachable. I bought from ... Maggs because of Len Deighton pushing me onto [them] as being a very fair dealer, saying that they do not charge you much more than they should. That&#x27;s a marvellous thing to be told&quot;.

Deighton&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Bomber&quot; was listed in Anthony Burgess&#x27;s 1984 work &quot;Ninety-Nine Novels&quot; as one of the 99 best novels in English since 1939. &quot;Bomber&quot;, the third album of the rock group Motörhead, was named after the novel, as the band&#x27;s singer, Lemmy, was reading it at the time they were recording the album.

<text>The subfamily Spiraeoideae was traditionally a subfamily of flowering plants within the family Rosaceae. The taxonomy of this subfamily has changed several times in the last century as more detailed studies have been carried out. Spiraeoideae as defined before 2007 is paraphyletic, leading some authors to define a broader subfamily which includes the Spiraeoideae as well as the Maleae (plants such as pears and apples whose fruits are pomes), and the Amygdaloideae (including almonds and plums, whose fruits are drupes). Such an expanded subfamily is to be called Amygdaloideae under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants.

The traditional Spiraeoideae are shrubs. Most have simple leaves, but the genera &quot;Aruncus&quot; and &quot;Sorbaria&quot; have pinnately compound leaves. Carpels are usually 2–5. Most genera traditionally placed in the Spiraeoideae produce flowers with distinct follicles that, upon seed-set, mature to form fruits that are aggregates of follicles.

A traditional classification places the following genera in the subfamily:
* &quot;Aruncus&quot;
* &quot;Eriogynia&quot;
* &quot;Euphronia&quot;
* &quot;Exochorda&quot;
* &quot;Gillenia&quot;
* &quot;Holodiscus&quot;
* &quot;Kageneckia&quot;
* &quot;Lindleya&quot;
* &quot;Neillia&quot;
* &quot;Physocarpus&quot;
* &quot;Quillaja&quot;
* &quot;Sibiraea&quot;
* &quot;Spiraea&quot;
* &quot;Spiraeanthus&quot;
* &quot;Sorbaria&quot;

<doc id="54088" wikidata="Q1749168" url="?curid=54088" title="Harry Palmer">
<text>Harry Palmer is the name given to the anti-hero protagonist of several films based on spy novels written by Len Deighton, in which the main character is an unnamed intelligence officer. For convenience, the novels are also often referred to as the &quot;Harry Palmer&quot; novels. 

Michael Caine played Harry Palmer in three films based on published novels featuring this character: &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965), &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1966) and &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967). Caine also starred as this character in two other films not directly based on Deighton&#x27;s novels.

&quot;The Times&quot; called Caine &quot;the epitome of Sixties cool in his first outing as the secret agent Harry Palmer&quot;. A trailer for his second role as Palmer described him as possessing &quot;horn rims, cockney wit and an iron fist&quot;. The character&#x27;s thick horn-rimmed glasses, girls, and disregard for authority was cited by Mike Myers as an influence for &quot;Austin Powers&quot;; Caine would later star in &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002), with his portrayal of Nigel Powers, father of secret agent Austin Powers, a spoof of Palmer.

==Origin of the &#x27;Harry Palmer&#x27; name==
When developing the 1965 film &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, based on Len Deighton&#x27;s 1962 novel of the same name, the production team needed a name for the previously anonymous protagonist, a rough-edged, petty crook turned spy. They chose &quot;Harry Palmer&quot;, because they wanted a mundane name, &#x27;one that means absolutely nothing, a common name&#x27;, to distance him from Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond, the stereotypical sophisticated, swashbuckling spy. Caine stated at the time of filming that he knew a dull kid at school called &quot;Palmer&quot;, with Harry Saltzman saying &#x27;good, and what about a first name?&#x27;, to which Caine innocently remarked &quot;Harry&quot;, not realising his gaffe until seeing Saltzman&#x27;s stare.

==Appearances==
==Novels==

=== Early novels ===
Len Deighton introduced the lead character in &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot;, his first novel, published in November 1962. In that first-person novel, the intelligence officer is anonymous, although at one point he is greeted by someone saying &quot;Hello, Harry&quot;; he later says, &quot;Now my name isn&#x27;t Harry, but in this business it&#x27;s hard to remember whether it ever had been.&quot; Deighton&#x27;s character is described as working class, living in a back street flat and seedy hotels, and shopping in supermarkets. He wears glasses, is hindered by bureaucracy, and craves a pay rise. It is revealed in passing that he is from Burnley, Lancashire, and that he was born in 1922 or 1923.

Further novels featuring this character followed, including &quot;Horse Under Water&quot; (1963), &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1964), &quot;Billion-Dollar Brain&quot; (1966), and &quot;An Expensive Place to Die&quot; (1967). Again, the lead character is never named, but they appear to be the same character in all of the books. In his 2009 afterword to &quot;Horse Under Water&quot;, Deighton noted &quot;Now, writing a second book, I found it an advantage to have an anonymous hero. He might be the same man; or maybe not. I was able to make minor changes to him and his background...I realized that...identifying him as a northerner would make demands on my knowledge that I could not sustain. It would be more sensible to give him a background closer to my own.&quot;

From the first novel onwards, the narrator shows knowledge of fine food and drink, painting, classical and 20th-century music, jazz, military history, and Latin. In &quot;Horse Under Water&quot;, he is described as an expert on world currency.

===Later novels and discrepancies===
In 1974, the novel &quot;Spy Story&quot; was published, followed by &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Spy&quot; (1975), and &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Spy&quot; (1976) (also known as &quot;Catch a Falling Spy&quot; in North America). As the protagonist also remains anonymous in these novels, it is still open to debate whether the narrator of these last three novels as the same as in the earlier books. There is conflicting evidence for either view. Despite this, and despite the lead protagonist being unnamed, all eight books have been unofficially called the &quot;Harry Palmer novels&quot;, based on the protagonist&#x27;s name given in the subsequent film adaptations of &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; and its sequels.

Evidence for this narrator being different from the earlier novels comes from Deighton himself, who is quoted as saying that the narrator of &quot;Spy Story&quot; is not the same character as the narrator of &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot;; in fact, for most of &quot;Spy Story&quot;, the narrator is named and addressed as &quot;Patrick Armstrong&quot; – although, as another character says, &quot;We have so many different names.&quot; Additionally, he is reported to be in his late 30s, whereas the narrator of &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; was born in 1922 or 1923 (making him in his 40s), and thus implying that this protagonist is different from that of the earlier novels.

Encouraging the unitary concept – that the later novels feature the same narrator – is the 1974 dust jacket to the Harcourt, Brace &amp; Jovanovich American edition of &quot;Spy Story&quot;, in which the cover blurb states, &quot;He is back, after five long-years&#x27; absence, the insubordinate, decent, bespectacled English spy who fought, fumbled, and survived his outrageous way through the best-selling &quot;Horse Under Water&quot;, &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot;, and the rest of those marvellous, celebrated Len Deighton spy thrillers.&quot; Likewise, on the 1976 edition dust jacket to &quot;Catch a Falling Spy&quot;, the novel features &quot;Deighton&#x27;s familiar hero, our bespectacled Englishman&quot;. A number of minor characters from the earlier novels also appear in &quot;Spy Story&quot;, further connecting the books.

==Film adaptations==

===&quot;The Ipcress File&quot;===
&quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; novel came out just after the release of the first James Bond film &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962). When the novel reached best-seller status, Eon Productions film producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli approached Deighton to write the script for the second Bond film, &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963). Little of Deighton&#x27;s screenplay was actually used on the shoot. Saltzman decided instead to make use of &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; in the expectation of beginning a new secret agent film series. Unlike the Bond films, &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; was designed to have a somewhat different, mostly rather naturalistic style, with hints of the kitchen sink school, film adaptations of which Saltzman had produced. Saltzman, however, also contracted crew members who had worked on the Bond films, including production designer Ken Adam, film editor Peter Hunt, and film score composer John Barry. Michael Caine was chosen to play the lead role.

In the film version, Harry Palmer is a British Army sergeant forcibly drafted into the security services to work away a prison sentence for black marketeering. He worked first for Army Intelligence, then the Foreign Office. He works for the brilliant but slightly duplicitous Colonel Ross. Harry Palmer has much in common with Deighton, including passions for military history (Harvey Newbegin complains about his bookshelf contents in &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot;), cooking, and classical music.

=== Sequels ===
After the release of &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965), Saltzman&#x27;s production company made &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1966) and &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967), both starring Michael Caine. The second Harry Palmer novel &quot;Horse Under Water&quot; was not used. In 1976, Deighton&#x27;s novel &quot;Spy Story&quot; was filmed with Michael Petrovitch as &#x27;Patrick Armstrong&#x27;; it is unrelated to Saltzman&#x27;s Harry Palmer films.

In the mid-1990s, two further Harry Palmer films were released, this time with original screenplays and with Michael Caine returning to the role. These were &quot;Bullet to Beijing&quot; (1995) and &quot;Midnight in Saint Petersburg&quot; (1996). Despite sometimes being titled &quot;Len Deighton&#x27;s Bullet to Beijing&quot; and &quot;Len Deighton&#x27;s Midnight in St Petersburg&quot;, Deighton did not participate in the production of these films.

=== Allusions ===
Evidence of Michael Caine&#x27;s popular identification as Harry Palmer can be seen in films such as &quot;Blue Ice&quot; (1992), where he plays an ex-spy named &#x27;Harry&#x27;, and who has many similarities to Harry Palmer.

Caine&#x27;s Harry Palmer character (with the glasses, the girls, and disregard for authority) was an influence for Mike Myers’ spy action comedy films &quot;Austin Powers&quot;. At Myers request, Caine starred in &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002), with his portrayal of Nigel Powers, father of secret agent Austin Powers, a spoof of Harry Palmer.

In &quot;&quot; (2014), Caine portrays the bespectacled head of a secret espionage unit.

==Television==
In 2022, ITV released a six-part television adaptation of &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, starring Joe Cole as Palmer.

<doc id="54089" wikidata="Q117581" url="?curid=54089" title="List of tram and light rail transit systems">
<text>The following is a list of cities that have current tram/streetcar (including heritage trams/heritage streetcars), or light rail systems as part of their regular public transit systems. In other words, this list only includes systems which operate year-round and provide actual transit service, not ones that are primarily tourist services, are seasonal-only, or are excursion-type tram operations.

Some transit systems branded as &quot;light rail&quot; such as the Docklands Light Railway in London, Ampang Line and Kelana Jaya Line of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia qualify as metro systems (see medium-capacity rail system) and thus are not listed here – see List of metro systems.

Only &quot;currently operational&quot; tram and LRT systems are included in this listing – tram and LRT systems that have &quot;suspended operation&quot; or are presently under construction are &quot;excluded&quot;.

==Legend==
; Location: Primary city served by the tram/streetcar or light rail system. 
; Country: Sovereign state in which the tram/streetcar or light rail system is located.
; System:The English name of the tram system or overview article for city.
; Year opened: The year the system opened for passenger service. For older systems, this may refer to horsecar service for those systems &quot;continuously&quot; in operation since their horsecar era.
; Stations: The number of stations in the network, as quoted by the system&#x27;s operator.
; System length: The system length of a tram/streetcar or light rail network is the sum of the lengths of all routes in the rail network in kilometers (or miles). Each section of track is counted only once, regardless of how many lines pass over it, and regardless of whether it is single-track or multi-track, single carriageway or dual carriageway.
; Type: Defines whether the system in question is a tram/streetcar system or a light rail transit system (or, in a few cases, whether the system is a heritage streetcar system).

== North America ==

The following systems provide regular transit service daily and year-round in North America, including those systems or lines using vintage or faux-vintage streetcars. For other heritage streetcar lines, ones with more limited service, see Streetcars in North America. North America, specifically more so the United States, once had extensive tram networks in almost all cities, but nearly all were removed for bus operations between the 1940s and the 1960s. These systems are listed at List of streetcar systems in the United States.

<doc id="54099" wikidata="Q179894" url="?curid=54099" title="Pantothenic acid">
<text>Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is a B vitamin and an essential nutrient. All animals need pantothenic acid in order to synthesize coenzyme A (CoA), which is essential for cellular energy production and for the synthesis and degradation of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.

Pantothenic acid is the combination of pantoic acid and β-alanine. Its name comes from the Greek &quot;pantothen&quot;, meaning &quot;from everywhere&quot;, because pantothenic acid, at least in small amounts, is in almost all foods. Deficiency of pantothenic acid is very rare in humans. In dietary supplements and animal feed, the form commonly used is calcium pantothenate, because chemically it is more stable, and hence makes for longer product shelf-life, than sodium pantothenate and free pantothenic acid.

==Definition==

Pantothenic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, one of the B vitamins. It is synthesized from the amino acid β-alanine and pantoic acid (see biosynthesis and structure of coenzyme A figures). Unlike vitamin E or vitamin K, which occurs in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, pantothenic acid is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a cofactor for many enzyme processes.

==Use in biosynthesis of coenzyme A==

Pantothenic acid is a precursor to CoA via a five-step process. The biosynthesis requires pantothenic acid, cysteine, and four equivalents of ATP (see figure). 
# Pantothenic acid is phosphorylated to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme pantothenate kinase. This is the committed step in CoA biosynthesis and requires ATP.
# A cysteine is added to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase to form 4&#x27;-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). This step is coupled with ATP hydrolysis.
# PPC is decarboxylated to 4′-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase
# 4′-Phosphopantetheine is adenylated (or more properly, AMPylated) to form dephospho-CoA by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase
# Finally, dephospho-CoA is phosphorylated to coenzyme A by the enzyme dephosphocoenzyme A kinase. This final step also requires ATP.

This pathway is suppressed by end-product inhibition, meaning that CoA is a competitive inhibitor of pantothenate kinase, the enzyme responsible for the first step.

Coenzyme A is necessary in the reaction mechanism of the citric acid cycle. This process is the body&#x27;s primary catabolic pathway and is essential in breaking down the building blocks of the cell such as carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids, for fuel. CoA is important in energy metabolism for pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) as acetyl-CoA, and for α-ketoglutarate to be transformed to succinyl-CoA in the cycle. CoA is also required for acylation and acetylation, which, for example, are involved in signal transduction, and various enzyme functions. In addition to functioning as CoA, this compound can act as an acyl group carrier to form acetyl-CoA and other related compounds; this is a way to transport carbon atoms within the cell. CoA is also required in the formation of acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is required for fatty acid synthesis. Its synthesis also connects with other vitamins such as thiamin and folic acid.

==Dietary recommendations==
The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for B vitamins in 1998. At that time, there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs for pantothenic acid. In instances such as this, the Board sets Adequate Intakes (AIs), with the understanding that at some later date, AIs may be replaced by more exact information.

The current AI for teens and adults ages 14 and up is 5 mg/day. This was based in part on the observation that for a typical diet, urinary excretion was approximately 2.6 mg/day, and that bioavailability of food-bound pantothenic acid was roughly 50%. AI for pregnancy is 6 mg/day. AI for lactation is 7 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months, the AI is 1.8 mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years, the AI increases with age from 2 to 4 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).

While for many nutrients, the US Department of Agriculture uses food composition data combined with food consumption survey results to estimate average consumption, the surveys and reports do not include pantothenic acid in the analyses. Less formal estimates of adult daily intakes report about 4 to 7 mg/day.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the US. For women and men over age 11, the Adequate Intake (AI) is set at 5 mg/day. AI for pregnancy is 5 mg/day, for lactation 7 mg/day. For children ages 1–10 years, the AI is 4 mg/day. These AIs are similar to the US AIs.

===Safety===
As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of pantothenic acid, there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. The EFSA also reviewed the safety question and reached the same conclusion as in the United States – that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for pantothenic acid.

===Labeling requirements===
For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For pantothenic acid labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 10 mg, but as of May 2016 it was revised to 5 mg to bring it into agreement with the AI. 
Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by January 2020 for manufacturers with US$10 million or more in annual food sales, and by January 2021 for manufacturers with lower volume food sales. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

==Sources==

===Dietary===
Food sources of pantothenic acid include animal-sourced foods, including dairy foods and eggs. Potatoes, tomato products, oat-cereals, sunflower seeds, avocado are good plant sources. Mushrooms are good sources, too. Whole grains are another source of the vitamin, but milling to make white rice or white flour removes much of the pantothenic acid, as it is found in the outer layers of whole grains. In animal feeds, the most important sources are alfalfa, cereal, fish meal, peanut meal, molasses, rice bran, wheat bran, and yeasts.

===Supplements===
Dietary supplements of pantothenic acid commonly use pantothenol (or &quot;panthenol&quot;), a shelf-stable analog, which is converted to pantothenic acid once consumed. Calcium pantothenate – a salt – may be used in manufacturing because it is more resistant than pantothenic acid to factors that deteriorate stability, such as acid, alkali or heat. The amount of pantothenic acid in dietary supplement products may contain up to 1,000 mg (200 times the Adequate Intake level for adults), without evidence that such large amounts provide any benefit. According to WebMD, pantothenic acid supplements have a long list of claimed uses, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support any of them.

As a dietary supplement, pantothenic acid is not the same as pantethine, which is composed of two pantothenic acid molecules linked by a disulfide bridge. Sold as a high-dose supplement (600 mg), pantethine may be effective for lowering blood levels of LDL cholesterol – a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases – but its long-term effects are unknown, so use should be supervised by a physician. Dietary supplementation with pantothenic acid does not have the cholesterol-lowering effect as pantethine.

===Fortification===
According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, pantothenic acid deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified.

==Absorption, metabolism and excretion==
When found in foods, most pantothenic acid is in the form of CoA or bound to acyl carrier protein (ACP). For the intestinal cells to absorb this vitamin, it must be converted into free pantothenic acid. Within the lumen of the intestine, CoA and ACP are hydrolyzed into 4&#x27;-phosphopantetheine. The 4&#x27;-phosphopantetheine is then dephosphorylated into pantetheine. Pantetheinase, an intestinal enzyme, then hydrolyzes pantetheine into free pantothenic acid. Free pantothenic acid is absorbed into intestinal cells via a saturable, sodium-dependent active transport system. At high levels of intake, when this mechanism is saturated, some pantothenic acid may also be additionally absorbed via passive diffusion. As a whole, when intake increases 10-fold, absorption rate decreases to 10%.

Pantothenic acid is excreted in urine. This occurs after its release from CoA. Urinary amounts are on the order of 2.6 mg/day, but decreased to negligible amounts when subjects in multi-week experimental situations were fed diets devoid of the vitamin.

==Deficiency==
Pantothenic acid deficiency in humans is very rare and has not been thoroughly studied. In the few cases where deficiency has been seen (prisoners of war during World War II, victims of starvation, or limited volunteer trials), nearly all symptoms were reversed with orally administered pantothenic acid. Symptoms of deficiency are similar to other vitamin B deficiencies. There is impaired energy production, due to low CoA levels, which could cause symptoms of irritability, fatigue, and apathy. Acetylcholine synthesis is also impaired; therefore, neurological symptoms can also appear in deficiency; they include sensation of numbness in hands and feet, paresthesia and muscle cramps. Additional symptoms could include restlessness, malaise, sleep disturbances, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps.

In animals, symptoms include disorders of the nervous, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, reduced growth rate, decreased food intake, skin lesions and changes in hair coat, and alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. In rodents, there can be loss of hair color, which led to marketing of pantothenic acid as a dietary supplement which could prevent or treat graying of hair in humans (despite the lack of any human trial evidence).

Pantothenic acid status can be assessed by measuring either whole blood concentration or 24-hour urinary excretion. In humans, whole blood values less than 1 μmol/L are considered low, as is urinary excretion of less than 4.56 mmol/day.

==Animal nutrition==

Calcium pantothenate and dexpanthenol (D-panthenol) are European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved additives to animal feed. Supplementation is on the order of 8–20 mg/kg for pigs, 10–15 mg/kg for poultry, 30–50 mg/kg for fish and 8–14 mg/kg feed for pets. These are recommended concentrations, designed to be higher than what are thought to be requirements. There is some evidence that feed supplementation increases pantothenic acid concentration in tissues, i.e., meat, consumed by humans, and also for eggs, but this raises no concerns for consumer safety.

No dietary requirement for pantothenic acid has been established in ruminant species. Synthesis of pantothenic acid by ruminal microorganisms appears to be 20 to 30 times more than dietary amounts. Net microbial synthesis of pantothenic acid in the rumen of steer calves has been estimated to be 2.2 mg/kg of digestible organic matter consumed per day. Supplementation of pantothenic acid at 5 to 10 times theoretical requirements did not improve growth performance of feedlot cattle.

==Synthesis==
===Biosynthesis===

Bacteria synthesize pantothenic acid from the amino acids aspartate and a precursor to the amino acid valine. Aspartate is converted to β-alanine. The amino group of valine is replaced by a keto-moiety to yield α-ketoisovalerate, which, in turn, forms α-ketopantoate following transfer of a methyl group, then D-pantoate (also known as pantoic acid) following reduction. β-alanine and pantoic acid are then condensed to form pantothenic acid (see figure).

===Industrial synthesis===
The industrial synthesis of pantothenic acid starts with the aldol condensation of isobutyraldehyde and formaldehyde. The resulting hydroxypivaldehyde is converted to its cyanohydrin derivative. which is cyclised to give racemic pantolactone. This sequence of reactions was first published in 1904.
Synthesis of the vitamin is completed by resolution of the lactone using quinine, for example, followed by treatment with the calcium or sodium salt of β-alanine.

==History==

The term &quot;vitamin&quot; is derived from the word &quot;vitamine&quot;, which was coined in 1912 by Polish biochemist Casimir Funk, who isolated a complex of water-soluble micronutrients essential to life, all of which he presumed to be amines. When this presumption was later determined not to be true, the &quot;e&quot; was dropped from the name, hence &quot;vitamin&quot;. Vitamin nomenclature was alphabetical, with Elmer McCollum calling these fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Over time, eight chemically distinct, water-soluble B vitamins were isolated and numbered, with pantothenic acid as vitamin B5.

The essential nature of pantothenic acid was discovered by Roger J. Williams in 1933 by showing it was required for the growth of yeast. Three years later Elvehjem and Jukes demonstrated that it was a growth and anti-dermatitis factor in chickens. Williams dubbed the compound &quot;pantothenic acid&quot;, deriving the name from the Greek word &quot;pantothen&quot;, which translates as &quot;from everywhere&quot;. His reason was that he found it to be present in almost every food he tested. Williams went on to determine the chemical structure in 1940. In 1953, Fritz Lipmann shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for his discovery of co-enzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism&quot;, work he had published in 1946.

<doc id="54104" wikidata="Q141180" url="?curid=54104" title="Vitamin E">
<text>Vitamin E is a group of eight compounds related in molecular structure that includes four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. The tocopherols function as fat-soluble antioxidants which may help protect cell membranes from reactive oxygen species. Vitamin E is classified as an essential nutrient for humans. Various government organizations recommend that adults consume between 3 and 15 mg per day, while a 2016 worldwide review reported a median dietary intake of 6.2 mg per day. Sources rich in vitamin E include seeds, nuts, seed oils, peanut butter, vitamin E–fortified foods, and dietary supplements. Symptomatic vitamin E deficiency is rare, usually caused by an underlying problem with digesting dietary fat rather than from a diet low in vitamin E. Deficiency can cause neurological disorders.

Tocopherols and tocotrienols both occur in α (alpha), β (beta), γ (gamma), and δ (delta) forms, as determined by the number and position of methyl groups on the chromanol ring. All eight of these vitamers feature a chromane double ring, with a hydroxyl group that can donate a hydrogen atom to reduce free radicals, and a hydrophobic side chain that allows for penetration into biological membranes. Both natural and synthetic tocopherols are subject to oxidation, so dietary supplements are esterified, creating tocopheryl acetate for stability purposes.

Population studies have suggested that people who consumed foods with more vitamin E, or who chose on their own to consume a vitamin E dietary supplement, had lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, dementia, and other diseases. However, placebo-controlled clinical trials using alpha-tocopherol as a supplement, with daily amounts as high as 2,000 mg per day, could not always replicate these findings. In the United States, vitamin E supplement use peaked around 2002, but had declined by over 50% by 2006. Declining use was theorized to be due to publications of meta-analyses that showed either no benefits or actual negative consequences from high-dose vitamin E.

Vitamin E was discovered in 1922, isolated in 1935, and first synthesized in 1938. Because the vitamin activity was first identified as essential for fertilized eggs to result in live births (in rats), it was given the name &quot;tocopherol&quot; from Greek words meaning &quot;birth&quot; and &quot;to bear&quot; or &quot;carry&quot;. Alpha-tocopherol, either naturally extracted from plant oils or, most commonly, as the synthetic tocopheryl acetate, is sold as a popular dietary supplement, either by itself or incorporated into a multivitamin product, and in oils or lotions for use on skin.

== Chemistry ==
The nutritional content of vitamin E is defined by equivalency to 100% RRR-configuration α-tocopherol activity. The molecules that contribute α-tocopherol activity are four tocopherols and four tocotrienols, within each group of four identified by the prefixes alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-), and delta- (δ-). For alpha(α)-tocopherol each of the three &quot;R&quot; sites has a methyl group (CH3) attached. For beta(β)-tocopherol: R1 = methyl group, R2 = H, R3 = methyl group. For gamma(γ)-tocopherol: R1 = H, R2 = methyl group, R3 = methyl group. For delta(δ)-tocopherol: R1 = H, R2 = H, R3 = methyl group. The same configurations exist for the tocotrienols, except that the unsaturated side chain has three carbon-carbon double bonds whereas the tocopherols have a saturated side chain.

=== Stereoisomers ===
In addition to distinguishing tocopherols and tocotrienols by position of methyl groups, the tocopherols have a phytyl tail with three chiral points or centers that can have a right or left orientation. The naturally occurring plant form of alpha-tocopherol is RRR-α-tocopherol, also referred to as d-tocopherol, whereas the synthetic form (all-racemic or &quot;all-rac&quot; vitamin E, also dl-tocopherol) is equal parts of eight stereoisomers RRR, RRS, RSS, SSS, RSR, SRS, SRR and SSR with progressively decreasing biological equivalency, so that 1.36 mg of dl-tocopherol is considered equivalent to 1.0 mg of d-tocopherol, the natural form. Rephrased, the synthetic has 73.5% of the potency of the natural.
=== Tocopherols ===
Alpha-tocopherol is a fat-soluble antioxidant functioning within the glutathione peroxidase pathway, and protecting cell membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the oxidation reaction from continuing. The oxidized α-tocopheroxyl radicals produced in this process may be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. Other forms of vitamin E have their own unique properties; for example, γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that can react with electrophilic mutagens.

=== Tocotrienols ===
The four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) are similar in structure to the four tocopherols, with the main difference being that the former have hydrophobic side chains with three carbon-carbon double bonds, whereas the tocopherols have saturated side chains. For &quot;alpha(α)&quot;-tocotrienol each of the three &quot;R&quot; sites has a methyl group (CH3) attached. For &quot;beta(β)&quot;-tocotrienol: R1 = methyl group, R2 = H, R3 = methyl group. For &quot;gamma(γ)&quot;-tocotrienol: R1 = H, R2 = methyl group, R3 = methyl group. For &quot;delta(δ)&quot;-tocotrienol: R1 = H, R2 = H, R3 = methyl group. Tocotrienols have only a single chiral center, which exists at the 2&#x27; chromanol ring carbon, at the point where the isoprenoid tail joins the ring. The other two corresponding centers in the phytyl tail of the corresponding tocopherols do not exist as chiral centers for tocotrienols due to unsaturation (C-C double bonds) at these sites. Tocotrienols extracted from plants are always dextrorotatory stereoisomers, signified as d-tocotrienols. In theory, levorotatory forms of tocotrienols (l-tocotrienols) could exist as well, which would have a 2S rather than 2R configuration at the molecules&#x27; single chiral center, but unlike synthetic dl-alpha-tocopherol, the marketed tocotrienol dietary supplements are extracted from palm oil or rice bran oil.

Tocotrienols are not essential nutrients; government organizations have not specified an estimated average requirement or recommended dietary allowance. A number of health benefits of tocotrienols have been proposed, including decreased risk of age-associated cognitive impairment, heart disease and cancer. Reviews of human research linked tocotrienol treatment to improved biomarkers for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, although those reviews did not report any information on clinically significant disease outcomes. Biomarkers for other diseases were not affected by tocotrienol supplementation.

== Functions ==

Vitamin E may have various roles as a vitamin. Many biological functions have been postulated, including a role as a lipid-soluble antioxidant. In this role, vitamin E acts as a radical scavenger, delivering a hydrogen (H) atom to free radicals. At 323 kJ/mol, the O-H bond in tocopherols is about 10% weaker than in most other phenols. This weak bond allows the vitamin to donate a hydrogen atom to the peroxyl radical and other free radicals, minimizing their damaging effect. The thus-generated tocopheryl radical is recycled to tocopherol by a redox reaction with a hydrogen donor, such as vitamin C.

Vitamin E affects gene expression and is an enzyme activity regulator, such as for protein kinase C (PKC) – which plays a role in smooth muscle growth – with vitamin E participating in deactivation of PKC to inhibit smooth muscle growth.

== Synthesis ==

=== Biosynthesis ===

Photosynthesizing plants, algae, and cyanobacteria synthesize tocochromanols, the chemical family of compounds made up of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols; in a nutrition context this family is referred to as Vitamin E. Biosynthesis starts with formation of the closed-ring part of the molecule as homogentisic acid (HGA). The side chain is attached (saturated for tocopherols, polyunsaturated for tocotrienols). The pathway for both is the same, so that gamma- is created and from that alpha-, or delta- is created and from that the beta- compounds. Biosynthesis takes place in the plastids.

The main reason plants synthesize tocochromanols appears to be for antioxidant activity. Different parts of plants, and different species, are dominated by different tocochromanols. The predominant form in leaves, and hence leafy green vegetables, is α-tocopherol. Located in chloroplast membranes in close proximity to the photosynthetic process, they protect against damage from the ultraviolet radiation of sunlight. Under normal growing conditions, the presence of α-tocopherol does not appear to be essential, as there are other photo-protective compounds; plants that, through mutations, have lost the ability to synthesize α-tocopherol demonstrate normal growth. However, under stressed growing conditions such as drought, elevated temperature, or salt-induced oxidative stress, the plants&#x27; physiological status is superior if it has the normal synthesis capacity.

Seeds are lipid-rich to provide energy for germination and early growth. Tocochromanols protect the seed lipids from oxidizing and becoming rancid. The presence of tocochromanols extends seed longevity and promotes successful germination and seedling growth. Gamma-tocopherol dominates in seeds of most plant species, but there are exceptions. For canola, corn and soy bean oils, there is more γ-tocopherol than α-tocopherol, but for safflower, sunflower and olive oils the reverse is true. Of the commonly used food oils, palm oil is unique in that tocotrienol content is higher than tocopherol content. Seed tocochromanols content is also dependent on environmental stressors. In almonds, for example, drought or elevated temperature increase α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol content of the nuts. Drought increases the tocopherol content of olives, and heat likewise for soybeans.

Vitamin E biosynthesis occurs in the plastid and goes through two different pathways: the Shikimate pathway and the Methylerythritol Phosphate pathway (MEP pathway).
The Shikimate pathway generates the chromanol ring from the Homogentisic Acid (HGA), and the MEP pathway produces the hydrophobic tail which differs between tocopherol and tocotrienol. The synthesis of the specific tail is dependent on which molecule it originates from. In a tocopherol, its prenyl tail emerges from the geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) group, while the phytyl tail of a tocotrienol stems from a phytyl diphosphate.

=== Industrial synthesis ===
The synthetic product is all-rac-alpha-tocopherol, also referred to as dl-alpha tocopherol. It consists of eight stereoisomers (RRR, RRS, RSS, RSR, SRR, SSR, SRS and SSS) in equal quantities. &quot;It is synthesized from a mixture of toluene and 2,3,5-trimethyl-hydroquinone that reacts with isophytol to all-rac-alpha-tocopherol, using iron in the presence of hydrogen chloride gas as catalyst. The reaction mixture obtained is filtered and extracted with aqueous caustic soda. Toluene is removed by evaporation and the residue (all rac-alpha-tocopherol) is purified by vacuum distillation.&quot; The natural alpha tocopherol extracted from plants is RRR-alpha tocopherol, referred to as d-alpha-tocopherol. The synthetic has 73.5% of the potency of the natural. Manufacturers of dietary supplements and fortified foods for humans or domesticated animals convert the phenol form of the vitamin to an ester using either acetic acid or succinic acid because the esters are more chemically stable, providing for a longer shelf-life.

== Deficiency ==
A worldwide summary of more than one hundred human studies reported a median of 22.1 μmol/L for serum α-tocopherol and defined α-tocopherol deficiency as less than 12 μmol/L. It cited a recommendation that serum α-tocopherol concentration be ≥30 μmol/L to optimize health benefits. In contrast, the U.S. Dietary Reference Intake text for vitamin E concluded that a plasma concentration of 12 μmol/L was sufficient to achieve normal ex vivo hydrogen peroxide-induced hemolysis. A 2014 review defined less than 9 μmol/L as deficient, 9-12 μmol/L as marginal, and greater than 12 μmol/L as adequate.

Regardless of which definition is used, vitamin E deficiency is rare in humans, occurring as a consequence of abnormalities in dietary fat absorption or metabolism rather than from a diet low in vitamin E. Cystic fibrosis and other fat malabsorption conditions can result in low serum vitamin E. One example of a genetic abnormality in metabolism is mutations of genes coding for alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (α-TTP). Humans with this genetic defect exhibit a progressive neurodegenerative disorder known as ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) despite consuming normal amounts of vitamin E. Large amounts of alpha-tocopherol as a dietary supplement are needed to compensate for the lack of α-TTP.

Bariatric surgery as a treatment for obesity can lead to vitamin deficiencies. Long-term follow-up reported a 16.5% prevalence of vitamin E deficiency. There are guidelines for multivitamin supplementation, but adherence rates are reported to be less than 20%.

Vitamin E deficiency due to either malabsorption or metabolic anomaly can cause nerve problems due to poor conduction of electrical impulses along nerves due to changes in nerve membrane structure and function. In addition to ataxia, vitamin E deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, myopathies, retinopathy, and impairment of immune responses.

== Drug interactions ==
The amounts of alpha-tocopherol, other tocopherols, and tocotrienols that are components of dietary vitamin E, when consumed from foods, do not appear to cause any interactions with drugs. Consumption of alpha-tocopherol as a dietary supplement in amounts in excess of 300 mg/day may lead to interactions with aspirin, warfarin, tamoxifen and cyclosporine A in ways that alter function. For aspirin and warfarin, high amounts of vitamin E may potentiate anti-blood clotting action. In multiple clinical trials, vitamin E lowered blood concentration of the immunosuppressant medication cyclosporine A. The US National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements, raises a concern that co-administration of vitamin E could counter the mechanisms of anti-cancer radiation therapy and some types of chemotherapy, and so advises against its use in these patient populations. The references it cites report instances of reduced treatment adverse effects, but also poorer cancer survival, raising the possibility of tumor protection from the intended oxidative damage by the treatments.

== Dietary recommendations ==
The U.S. National Academy of Medicine updated estimated average requirements (EARs) and recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin E in 2000. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. Adequate intakes (AIs) are identified when there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs. The EAR for vitamin E for women and men ages 14 and up is 12 mg/day. The RDA is 15 mg/day. As for safety, tolerable upper intake levels (&quot;upper limits&quot; or ULs) are set for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. Hemorrhagic effects in rats were selected as the critical endpoint to calculate the upper limit via starting with the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level. The result was a human upper limit set at 1000 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as dietary reference values, with population reference intakes (PRIs) instead of RDAs, and average requirements instead of EARs. AIs and ULs are defined the same as in the United States. For women and men ages 10 and older, the PRIs are set at 11 and 13 mg/day, respectively. PRI for pregnancy is 11 mg/day, for lactation 11 mg/day. For children ages 1–9 years the PRIs increase with age from 6 to 9 mg/day. The EFSA used an effect on blood clotting as a safety-critical effect. It identified that no adverse effects were observed in a human trial as 540 mg/day, used an uncertainty factor of 2 to derive an upper limit of half of that, then rounded to 300 mg/day.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China publishes dietary guidelines without specifics for individual vitamins or minerals. The United Kingdom recommends 4 mg/day for adult men and 3 mg/day for adult women. The Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition set adult AIs at 6.5 mg/day (females) and 7.0 mg/day (males), and 650–700 mg/day (females), and 750–900 mg/day (males) for upper limits (amounts depending on age). India recommends an adult intake of 7.5–10 mg/day and does not set an upper limit. The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume 10 mg/day.

Consumption tends to be below these recommendations. A worldwide summary reported a median dietary intake of 6.2 mg/d for alpha-tocopherol.

=== Food labeling ===
For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value. For vitamin E labeling purposes 100% of the daily value was 30 international units (IUs), but as of May 2016, it was revised to 15 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

European Union regulations require that labels declare energy, protein, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sugars, and salt. Voluntary nutrients may be shown if present in significant amounts. Instead of daily values, amounts are shown as percent of reference intakes (RIs). For vitamin E, 100% RI was set at 12 mg in 2011.

The international unit measurement was used by the United States in 1968–2016. 1 IU is the biological equivalent of about 0.667 mg d (RRR)-alpha-tocopherol (2/3 mg exactly), or of 0.90 mg of dl-alpha-tocopherol, corresponding to the then-measured relative potency of stereoisomers. In May 2016, the measurements were revised, such that 1 mg of &quot;Vitamin E&quot; is 1 mg of d-alpha-tocopherol or 2 mg of dl-alpha-tocopherol. The change was originally started in 2000, when forms of vitamin E other than alpha-tocopherol were dropped from dietary calculations by the IOM. The UL amount disregards any conversion. The EFSA has never used an IU unit, and their measurement only considers RRR-alpha-tocopherol.

== Sources ==
Of the different forms of vitamin E, gamma-tocopherol (γ-tocopherol) is the most common form found in the North American diet, but alpha-tocopherol (α-tocopherol) is the most biologically active.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Services, maintains a food composition database. The last major revision was Release 28, September 2015. Common naturally occurring vitamin E sources are shown in the table, as are some alpha-tocopherol fortified sources such as ready-to-eat cereals, infant formulas, and liquid nutrition products.





Tocotrienols occur in some food sources, the richest being palm oil, and to a lesser extent rice bran oil, barley, oats, and certain seeds, nuts and grains, and the oils derived from them.

=== Supplements ===

Vitamin E is fat soluble, so dietary supplement products are usually in the form of the vitamin, esterified with acetic acid to generate tocopheryl acetate, and dissolved in vegetable oil in a softgel capsule. For alpha-tocopherol, amounts range from 100 to 1000 IU per serving. Smaller amounts are incorporated into multi-vitamin/mineral tablets. Gamma-tocopherol and tocotrienol supplements are also available from dietary supplement companies. The latter are extracts from palm oil.

=== Fortification ===
The World Health Organization does not have any recommendations for food fortification with vitamin E. The Food Fortification Initiative does not list any countries that have mandatory or voluntary programs for vitamin E. Infant formulas have alpha-tocopherol as an ingredient. In some countries, certain brands of ready-to-eat cereals, liquid nutrition products, and other foods have alpha-tocopherol as an added ingredient.

=== Non-nutrient food additives ===
Various forms of vitamin E are common food additives in oily food, used to deter rancidity caused by peroxidation. Those with an E number include:
# E306 Tocopherol-rich extract (mixed, natural, can include tocotrienol)
# E307 Alpha-tocopherol (synthetic)
# E308 Gamma-tocopherol (synthetic)
# E309 Delta-tocopherol (synthetic)

These E numbers include all racemic forms and acetate esters thereof. Commonly found on food labels in Europe and some other countries, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority.

==Absorption, metabolism, excretion ==
Tocotrienols and tocopherols, the latter including the stereoisomers of synthetic alpha-tocopherol, are absorbed from the intestinal lumen, incorporated into chylomicrons, and secreted into the portal vein, leading to the liver. Absorption efficiency is estimated at 51% to 86%, and that applies to all of the vitamin E family – there is no discrimination among the vitamin E vitamers during absorption. Bile is necessary for chylomicron formation, so disease conditions such as cystic fibrosis result in biliary insufficiency and vitamin E malabsorption. When consumed as an alpha-tocopheryl acetate dietary supplement, absorption is promoted when consumed with a fat-containing meal. Unabsorbed vitamin E is excreted via feces. Additionally, vitamin E is excreted by the liver via bile into the intestinal lumen, where it will either be reabsorbed or excreted via feces, and all of the vitamin E vitamers are metabolized and then excreted via urine.

Upon reaching the liver, RRR-alpha-tocopherol is preferentially taken up by alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (α-TTP). All other forms are degraded to 2&#x27;-carboxethyl-6-hydroxychromane (CEHC), a process that involves truncating the phytic tail of the molecule, then either sulfated or glucuronidated. This renders the molecules water-soluble and leads to excretion via urine. Alpha-tocopherol is also degraded by the same process, to 2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(2&#x27;-carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxychromane (α-CEHC), but more slowly because it is partially protected by α-TTP. Large intakes of α-tocopherol result in increased urinary α-CEHC, so this appears to be a means of disposing of excess vitamin E.

Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein is coded by the &quot;TTPA&quot; gene on chromosome 8. The binding site for RRR-α-tocopherol is a hydrophobic pocket with a lower affinity for beta-, gamma-, or delta-tocopherols, or for the stereoisomers with an S configuration at the chiral 2 site. Tocotrienols are also a poor fit because the double bonds in the phytic tail create a rigid configuration that is a mismatch with the α-TTP pocket. A rare genetic defect of the &quot;TTPA&quot; gene results in people exhibiting a progressive neurodegenerative disorder known as ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) despite consuming normal amounts of vitamin E. Large amounts of alpha-tocopherol as a dietary supplement are needed to compensate for the lack of α-TTP. The role of α-TTP is to move α-tocopherol to the plasma membrane of hepatocytes (liver cells), where it can be incorporated into newly created very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) molecules. These convey α-tocopherol to cells in the rest of the body. As an example of a result of the preferential treatment, the US diet delivers approximately 70 mg/d of γ-tocopherol, and plasma concentrations are on the order of 2–5 μmol/L; meanwhile, dietary α-tocopherol is about 7 mg/d, but plasma concentrations are in the range of 11–37 μmol/L.

Affinity of α-TTP for vitamin E vitamers
== Medical applications ==
Vitamin E has been suggested as a supplement for helping many health conditions, mostly due to its antioxidant activity and potential to protect cells from oxidative damage. In the US, the vitamin is widely available as an over-the-counter supplement; however, medical evidence supporting its effectiveness and safety for treating or preventing a variety of health conditions is mixed. Vitamin E can also interact with some medications and other supplements. Vitamin E has been studied as a treatment for skin health and skin ageing, immune function, and managing conditions like cardiovascular disease or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), or certain types of cancer. Most studies have found limited or inconclusive benefits and the potential for some risks. It is most often recommended to obtain vitamin E through a balanced diet because high-dose supplementation may have health risks. There is evidence that the sale of dietary supplement vitamin E has decreased by up to 33% following a report showing little or no effect of vitamin E in preventing cancer or cardiovascular disease.

In 2022, it was the 244th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

=== All-cause mortality ===
Two meta-analyses concluded that as a dietary supplement, vitamin E neither improved nor impaired all-cause mortality. A meta-analysis of long-term clinical trials reported a non-significant 2% increase in all-cause mortality when alpha-tocopherol was the only supplement used. The same journal article reported a statistically significant 3% increase for results when alpha-tocopherol was used in combination with other nutrients (vitamin A, vitamin C, beta-carotene, selenium).

=== Age-related macular degeneration ===
A Cochrane review concluded that there were no changes seen for risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD) from long-term vitamin E supplementation and that supplementation may slightly increase the chances of developing late AMD.

=== Cognitive impairment and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
Two meta-analyses reported lower vitamin E blood levels in AD people compared to healthy, age-matched people. However, a review of vitamin E supplementation trials concluded that there was insufficient evidence to state that supplementation reduced the risk of developing AD or slowed the progression of AD.

=== Cancer ===
In a 2022 update of an earlier report, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against the use of vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer, concluding there was insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms, yet also concluding with moderate certainty that there is no net benefit of supplementation.

As for literature on different types of cancer, an inverse relationship between dietary vitamin E and kidney cancer and bladder cancer is seen in observational studies. A large clinical trial reported no difference in bladder cancer cases between treatment and placebo.

An inverse relationship between dietary vitamin E and lung cancer was reported in observational studies, but a large clinical trial in male tobacco smokers reported no impact on lung cancer between treatment and placebo, and a trial which tracked people who chose to consume a vitamin E dietary supplement reported an increased risk of lung cancer for those consuming more than 215 mg/day.

For prostate cancer, there are also conflicting results. A meta-analysis based on serum alpha-tocopherol content reported an inverse correlation in relative risk, but a second meta-analysis of observational studies reported no such relationship. A large clinical trial with male tobacco smokers and reported a 32% decrease in the incidence of prostate cancer, but the SELECT trial of selenium or vitamin E for prostate cancer enrolled men ages 55 or older and reported relative risk 17% higher for the vitamin group.

For colorectal cancer, a systematic review of randomized clinical trials and the large SELECT trial reported no statistically significant change in relative risk. The Women&#x27;s Health Study reported no significant differences for incidences of all types of cancer, cancer deaths, or specifically for breast, lung or colon cancers.

Potential confounding factors are the form of vitamin E used in prospective studies and the amounts. Synthetic, racemic mixtures of vitamin E isomers are not bioequivalent to natural, non-racemic mixtures, yet are widely used in clinical trials and as dietary supplement ingredients. One review reported a modest increase in cancer risk with vitamin E supplementation while stating that more than 90% of the cited clinical trials used the synthetic, racemic form dl-alpha-tocopherol.

==== Cancer health claims ====
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration initiated a process of reviewing and approving food and dietary supplement health claims in 1993. Reviews of petitions results in proposed claims being rejected or approved. If approved, specific wording is allowed on package labels. In 1999, a second process for claims review was created. If there is not a scientific consensus on the totality of the evidence, a Qualified Health Claim (QHC) may be established. The FDA does not &quot;approve&quot; qualified health claim petitions. Instead, it issues a Letter of Enforcement Discretion that includes very specific claim language and the restrictions on using that wording. The first QHCs relevant to vitamin E were issued in 2003: &quot;Some scientific evidence suggests that consumption of antioxidant vitamins may reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer.&quot; In 2009, the claims became more specific, allowing that vitamin E might reduce the risk of renal, bladder and colorectal cancers, but with required mention that the evidence was deemed weak and the claimed benefits highly unlikely. A petition to add brain, cervical, gastric and lung cancers was rejected. A further revision, May 2012, allowed that vitamin E may reduce risk of renal, bladder and colorectal cancers, with a more concise qualifier sentence added: &quot;FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence for this claim.&quot; Any company product label making the cancer claims has to include a qualifier sentence.

=== Cataracts ===
A review measured serum tocopherol and reported higher serum concentration was associated with a 23% reduction in relative risk of age-related cataracts (ARC), with the effect due to differences in nuclear cataract rather than cortical or posterior subcapsular cataract. In contrast, meta-analyses reporting on clinical trials of alpha-tocopherol supplementation reported no statistically significant change to risk of ARC compared to placebo.

=== Cardiovascular diseases ===
In a 2022 update of an earlier report, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against the use of vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer, concluding there was insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms, yet also concluding with moderate certainty that there is no net benefit of supplementation.

Research on the effects of vitamin E on cardiovascular disease has produced conflicting results. In theory, oxidative modification of LDL-cholesterol promotes blockages in coronary arteries that lead to atherosclerosis and heart attacks, so vitamin E functioning as an antioxidant would reduce oxidized cholesterol and lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Vitamin E status has also been implicated in the maintenance of normal endothelial cell function of cells lining the inner surface of arteries, anti-inflammatory activity and inhibition of platelet adhesion and aggregation. An inverse relation has been observed between coronary heart disease and the consumption of foods high in vitamin E, and also higher serum concentration of alpha-tocopherol. The problem with observational studies is that these cannot confirm a relation between the lower risk of coronary heart disease and vitamin E consumption diets higher in vitamin E may also be higher in other, unidentified components that promote heart health, or lower in diet components detrimental to heart health, or people choosing such diets may be making other healthy lifestyle choices.

A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reported that when consumed without any other antioxidant nutrient, the relative risk of heart attack was reduced by 18%. However, two large trials that were incorporated into the meta-analysis either did not show any benefit for heart attack, stroke, coronary mortality or all-cause mortality, or else a higher risk of heart failure in the alpha-tocopherol group.

Vitamin E supplementation does not reduce the incidence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. However, supplementation of vitamin E with other antioxidants reduced risk of ischemic stroke by 9% while increased the risk for hemorrhagic stroke by 22%.

==== Denial of cardiovascular health claims ====
In 2001, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected proposed health claims for vitamin E and cardiovascular health. The U.S. National Institutes of Health reviewed literature published up to 2008 and concluded &quot;In general, clinical trials have not provided evidence that routine use of vitamin E supplements prevents cardiovascular disease or reduces its morbidity and mortality.&quot; The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviews proposed health claims for the European Union countries. In 2010, the EFSA reviewed and rejected claims that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of vitamin E and maintenance of normal cardiac function or of normal blood circulation.

=== Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ===
Supplemental vitamin E significantly reduced elevated liver enzymes, steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting that the vitamin may be useful for treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the more extreme subset known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in adults, but not in children.

===Exercise recovery===
In healthy adults, after exercise, vitamin E was shown to not have any benefits for post-exercise recovery, as measured by muscle soreness and muscle strength, or measured by indicators for inflammation or muscle damage, such as interleukin-6 and creatine kinase.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===
For Parkinson&#x27;s disease, there is an observed inverse correlation seen with dietary vitamin E, but no confirming evidence from placebo-controlled clinical trials.

=== Pregnancy ===
Supplementation with a combination of vitamins E and C during pregnancy is not recommended by the World Health Organization. A Cochrane review concluded there was no support for the combination reducing risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, preeclampsia, or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications.

===Topical applications===
There is widespread use of tocopheryl acetate in some skincare and wound-treatment products as a topical medication, with claims for improved wound healing and reduced scar tissue, but reviews have repeatedly concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support these claims. There are also reports of allergic contact dermatitis from use of vitamin-E derivatives such as tocopheryl linoleate and tocopherol acetate in skin care products.

== Vaping-associated lung injury ==
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated in February 2020 that previous research suggested inhaled vitamin E acetate (α-tocopheryl acetate) may interfere with normal lung functioning. In September 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration had announced that vape liquids linked to recent vaping related lung disease outbreak in the United States, tested positive for vitamin E acetate which had been used as a thickening agent by illicit THC vape cartridge manufacturers. By November 2019, the CDC had identified vitamin E acetate as a very strong culprit of concern in the vaping-related illnesses, but has not ruled out other chemicals or toxicants as possible causes. These findings were based on fluid samples from the lungs of people with vaping-associated pulmonary injury. Pyrolysis of vitamin E acetate produces exceptionally toxic ketene gas, along with carcinogenic alkenes and benzene.

== History ==
Vitamin E was discovered in 1922 by Herbert McLean Evans and Katharine Scott Bishop and first isolated in a pure form by Evans and Gladys Anderson Emerson in 1935 at the University of California, Berkeley. Because the vitamin activity was first identified as a dietary fertility factor in rats, it was given the name &quot;tocopherol&quot; from the Greek words &quot;τόκος&quot; [tókos, birth], and &quot;φέρειν&quot;, [phérein, to bear or carry] meaning in sum &quot;to carry a pregnancy,&quot; with the ending &quot;-ol&quot; signifying its status as a chemical alcohol. George M. Calhoun, Professor of Greek at the University of California, was credited with helping with the naming process. Erhard Fernholz elucidated its structure in 1938 and shortly afterward the same year, Paul Karrer and his team first synthesized it.

Nearly 50 years after the discovery of vitamin E, an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association titled &quot;Vitamin in search of a disease&quot; read in part &quot;...research revealed many of the vitamin&#x27;s secrets, but no certain therapeutic use and no definite deficiency disease in man.&quot; The animal discovery experiments had been a requirement for successful pregnancy, but no benefits were observed for women prone to miscarriage. Evidence for vascular health was characterized as unconvincing. The editorial closed with mention of some preliminary human evidence for protection against hemolytic anemia in young children.

A role for vitamin E in coronary heart disease was first proposed in 1946 by Evan Shute and colleagues. More cardiovascular work from the same research group followed, including a proposal that megadoses of vitamin E could slow down and even reverse the development of atherosclerosis. Subsequent research showed no association between vitamin E supplementation and cardiovascular events such as nonfatal stroke or myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular mortality.

There is a long history of belief that topical application of vitamin E containing oil benefits burn and wound healing. This belief persists even though scientific reviews refuted this claim.

The role of vitamin E in infant nutrition has a long research history. From 1949 onward there were trials with premature infants suggesting that oral alpha-tocopherol was protective against edema, intracranial hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia and retrolental fibroplasia. A more recent review concluded that vitamin E supplementation in preterm infants reduced the risk of intracranial hemorrhage and retinopathy, but noted an increased risk of sepsis.

<text>Tocopherols (; TCP) are a class of organic compounds comprising various methylated phenols, many of which have vitamin E activity. Because the vitamin activity was first identified in 1936 from a dietary fertility factor in rats, it was named &quot;tocopherol&quot;, from Greek &quot;tókos&quot; &#x27;birth&#x27; and &quot;phérein&quot; &#x27;to bear or carry&#x27;, that is &#x27;to carry a pregnancy&#x27;, with the ending &quot;-ol&quot; signifying its status as a chemical alcohol.

α-Tocopherol is the main source found in supplements and in the European diet, where the main dietary sources are olive and sunflower oils, while γ-tocopherol is the most common form in the American diet due to a higher intake of soybean and corn oil.

==Forms==
Vitamin E exists in eight different forms, four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. All feature a chromane ring, with a hydroxyl group that can donate a hydrogen atom to reduce free radicals and a hydrophobic side chain that allows for penetration into biological membranes. Both the tocopherols and tocotrienols occur in α (alpha), β (beta), γ (gamma), and δ (delta) forms, determined by the number and position of methyl groups on the chromanol ring. 

The tocotrienols have the same methyl structure at the ring and the same Greek-letter methyl notation, but differ from the analogous tocopherols by the presence of three double bonds in the hydrophobic side chain. The unsaturation of the tails gives tocotrienols only a single stereoisomeric carbon (and thus two possible isomers per structural formula, one of which occurs naturally), whereas tocopherols have three centers (and eight possible stereoisomers per structural formula, again, only one of which occurs naturally).
Each form has a different biological activity.
In general, the unnatural l-isomers of tocotrienols lack almost all vitamin activity, and half of the possible 8 isomers of the tocopherols (those with 2S chirality at the ring–tail junction) also lack vitamin activity. Of the stereoisomers that retain activity, increasing methylation, especially full methylation to the α-form, increases vitamin activity. In tocopherols, this is due to the higher binding energy of the α-tocopherol form of the vitamin to the tocopherol binding protein.

As a food additive, tocopherol is labeled with these E numbers: E306 (tocopherol), E307 (α-tocopherol), E308 (γ-tocopherol), and E309 (δ-tocopherol). All of these are approved in the US, EU, and Australia and New Zealand for use as antioxidants.

===α-Tocopherol===

α-Tocopherol is the form of vitamin E that is preferentially absorbed and accumulated in humans. The measurement of &quot;vitamin E&quot; activity in international units (IU) was based on fertility enhancement by the prevention of miscarriages in pregnant rats relative to α-tocopherol.

Although the mono-methylated form ddd-γ-tocopherol is the most prevalent form of vitamin E in oils, there is evidence that rats can methylate this form to the preferred α-tocopherol, since several generations of rats retained α-tocopherol tissue levels, even when those generations were fed only γ-tocopherol through their lives.

There are three stereocenters in α-tocopherol, so this is a chiral molecule. The eight stereoisomers of α-tocopherol differ in the arrangement of groups around these stereocenters. In the image of &quot;RRR&quot;-α-tocopherol below, all three stereocenters are in the &quot;R&quot; form. However, if the middle of the three stereocenters were changed (so the hydrogen was now pointing down and the methyl group pointing up), this would become the structure of &quot;RSR&quot;-α-tocopherol. These stereoisomers also may be named in an alternative older nomenclature, where the stereocenters are either in the &quot;d&quot; or &quot;l&quot; form.

1 IU of tocopherol is defined as ⅔ milligrams of &quot;RRR&quot;-α-tocopherol (formerly named d-α-tocopherol or sometimes ddd-α-tocopherol). 1 IU is also defined as 1 milligram of an equal mix of the eight stereoisomers, which is a racemic mixture called &quot;all-rac&quot;-α-tocopheryl acetate. This mix of stereoisomers is often called dl-α-tocopheryl acetate, even though it is more precisely ). However, 1 IU of this racemic mixture is not now considered equivalent to 1 IU of natural (RRR) α-tocopherol, and the Institute of Medicine and the USDA now convert IU&#x27;s of the racemic mixture to milligrams of equivalent RRR using 1 IU racemic mixture = 0.45 &quot;milligrams α-tocopherol&quot;.

===Tocotrienols===

Tocotrienols also belong to the vitamin E family. Tocotrienols have four natural 2&#x27; d-isomers (they have a stereoisomeric carbon only at the 2&#x27; ring-tail position). The four tocotrienols (in order of decreasing methylation: d-α-, d-β-, d-γ-, and d-δ-tocotrienol) have structures corresponding to the four tocopherols, except with an unsaturated bond in each of the three isoprene units that form the hydrocarbon tail, whereas tocopherols have a saturated phytyl tail (the phytyl tail of tocopherols gives the possibility for 2 more stereoisomeric sites in these molecules that tocotrienols do not have). Tocotrienols have seen less research as compared to tocopherols.

==Function and dietary recommendations==

===Mechanism of action===
Tocopherols are radical scavengers, delivering an H atom to quench free radicals. At 323 kJ/mol, the O–H bond in tocopherols is approximately 10% weaker than in most other phenols. This weak bond allows the vitamin to donate a hydrogen atom to the peroxyl radical and other free radicals, minimizing their damaging effect. The thus generated tocopheryl radical is relatively unreactive, but reverts to tocopherol by a redox reaction with a hydrogen donor such as vitamin C. As they are fat-soluble, tocopherols are incorporated into cell membranes, which are thus protected from oxidative damage.

===Dietary considerations===
The U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults is 15 mg/day. The RDA is based on the α-tocopherol form because it is the most active form as originally tested. Vitamin E supplements are absorbed best when taken with meals. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has set an upper tolerable intake level (UL) for vitamin E at 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) per day. The European Food Safety Authority sets UL at 300 mg α-tocopherol equivalents per day.

===α-Tocopherol equivalents===
For dietary purposes, vitamin E activity of vitamin E isomers is expressed as α-tocopherol equivalents (a-TEs). One a-TE is defined by the biological activity of 1 mg (natural) d-α-tocopherol in the resorption-gestation test. According to listings by FAO and others β-tocopherol should be multiplied by 0.5, γ-tocopherol by 0.1, and α-tocotrienol by 0.3. The IU is converted to aTE by multiplying it with 0.67. These factors do not correlate with the antioxidant activity of vitamin E isomers, where tocotrienols show even much higher activity in vivo.

==Sources==

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Services, maintains a food composition database. The last major revision was Release 28, September 2015. In general, food sources with the highest concentrations of vitamin E are vegetable oils, followed by nuts and seeds. Adjusting for typical portion sizes, however, for many people in the United States the most important sources of vitamin E include fortified breakfast cereals.

==Deficiency==

Vitamin E deficiency is rare, and in almost all instances caused by an underlying disease rather than a diet low in vitamin E. Vitamin E deficiency causes neurological problems due to poor nerve conduction. These include neuromuscular problems such as spinocerebellar ataxia and myopathies. Deficiency also may cause anemia, due to oxidative damage to red blood cells.

==Supplements==
Commercial vitamin E supplements may be classified into several distinct categories:
* Fully synthetic vitamin E, &quot;dl-α-tocopherol&quot;, the most inexpensive, most commonly sold supplement form usually as the acetate ester
* Semi-synthetic &quot;natural source&quot; vitamin E esters, the &quot;natural source&quot; forms used in tablets and multiple vitamins; these are highly fractionated d-α-tocopherol or its esters, often made by synthetic methylation of gamma and beta vitamers extracted from plant oils.
* Less fractionated &quot;natural mixed tocopherols&quot; and high d-γ-tocopherol fraction supplements

===Synthetic all-racemic===
Synthetic vitamin E derived from petroleum products is manufactured as all-racemic α-tocopheryl acetate with a mixture of eight stereoisomers. In this mixture, one α-tocopherol molecule in eight molecules are in the form of &quot;RRR&quot;-α-tocopherol (12.5% of the total).

The 8-isomer &quot;all-rac&quot; vitamin E is always marked on labels simply as dl-tocopherol or dl-tocopheryl acetate, even though it is (if fully written out) . The present largest manufacturers of this type are DSM and BASF.

Natural α-tocopherol is the RRR-α (or ddd-α) form. The synthetic (&quot;dl-α&quot;) form is not so active as the natural ddd-α (&quot;d-α&quot;) tocopherol form. This is mainly due to reduced vitamin activity of the four possible stereoisomers that are represented by the &quot;l&quot; or &quot;S&quot; enantiomer at the first stereocenter (an S or l configuration between the chromanol ring and the tail, i.e., the SRR, SRS, SSR, and SSS stereoisomers). The three unnatural &quot;2R&quot; stereoisomers with natural R configuration at this 2&#x27; stereocenter, but S at one of the other centers in the tail (i.e., RSR, RRS, RSS), appear to retain substantial RRR vitamin activity, because they are recognized by the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein, and thus maintained in the plasma, where the other four stereoisomers (SRR, SRS, SSR, and SSS) are not. Thus, the synthetic all-rac-α-tocopherol, in theory, would have approximately half the vitamin activity of RRR-α-tocopherol in humans. Experimentally, the ratio of activities of the 8 stereoisomer racemic mixture to the natural vitamin, is 1 to 1.36 in the rat pregnancy model (suggesting a measured activity ratio of 1/1.36 = 74% of natural, for the 8-isomer racemic mix).

Although it is clear that mixtures of stereoisomers are not so active as the natural &quot;RRR&quot;-α-tocopherol form, in the ratios discussed above, specific information on any side effects of the seven synthetic vitamin E stereoisomers is not readily available.

===Esters===
Manufacturers also commonly convert the phenol form of the vitamins (with a free hydroxyl group) to esters, using acetic or succinic acid. These tocopheryl esters are more stable and are easy to use in vitamin supplements. α-Tocopheryl esters are de-esterified in the gut and then absorbed as the free tocopherol. Tocopheryl nicotinate, tocopheryl linolate, and tocopheryl palmitate esters are also used in cosmetics and some pharmaceuticals.

===Mixed tocopherols===
&quot;Mixed tocopherols&quot; in the USA contain at least 20% w/w other natural R, R,R- tocopherols, i.e. R, R,R-α-tocopherol content plus at least 25% R, R,R-β-, R, R,R-γ-, R, R,R-δ-tocopherols.

Some brands may contain 20.0% w/w or more of the other tocopherols and measurable tocotrienols. Some mixed tocopherols with higher γ-tocopherol content are marketed as &quot;High Gamma-Tocopherol&quot;. The label should report each component in milligrams, except R, R,R-α-tocopherol may still be reported in IU. Mixed tocopherols also may be found in other nutritional supplements.

==Uses==

Observational studies that measure dietary intake and/or serum concentration, and experimental studies that ideally are randomized clinical trials (RCTs), are two means of examining the effects or lack thereof of a proposed intervention on human health. Healthcare outcomes may be expected to be in accord between reviews of observational and experimental studies. If there is a lack of agreement, then factors other than design need to be considered. In observational studies on vitamin E, an inverse correlation between dietary intake and risk of a disease, or serum concentration and risk of a disease, may be considered suggestive, but any conclusions also should rest on randomized clinical trials of sufficient size and duration to measure clinically significant results. One concern with correlations is that other nutrients and non-nutrient compounds (such as polyphenols) may be higher in the same diets that are higher in vitamin E. Another concern for the relevance of RCTs described below is that while observational studies are comparing disease risk between low and high dietary intake of naturally occurring vitamin E from food (when worldwide, the adult median dietary intake is 6.2 mg/d for d-α-tocopherol; 10.2 mg/day when all of the tocopherol and tocotrienol isomers are included), the prospective RCTs often used 400 IU/day of synthetic dl-α-tocopherol as the test product, equivalent to 268 mg of α-tocopherol equivalents.

===Supplement popularity over time===
In the US, the popularity for vitamin E as a dietary supplement may have peaked around 2000. The Nurses&#x27; Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) tracked dietary supplement use by people over the age of 40 during years 1986–2006. For women, user prevalence was 16.1% in 1986, 46.2% in 1998, 44.3% in 2002, but had decreased to 19.8% in 2006. Similarly, for men, prevalence for same years was 18.9%, 52.0%, 49.4%, and 24.5%. The authors theorized that declining use in these health science aware populations may have been due to publications of studies that showed either no benefits or negative consequences from vitamin E supplements. There is other evidence for declining use of vitamin E. Within the U.S. military services, vitamin prescriptions written for active, reserve and retired military, and their dependents, were tracked over years 2007–2011. Vitamin E prescriptions decreased by 53% while vitamin C remained constant and vitamin D increased by 454%. A report on vitamin E sales volume in the USA documented a 50% decrease between 2000 and 2006, with a significant cause attributed to a well-publicized meta-analysis that had concluded that high-dosage vitamin E increased all-cause mortality.

=== Age-related macular degeneration ===
A Cochrane review published in 2017 (updated in 2023) on antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identified only one vitamin E clinical trial. That trial compared 500 IU/day of α-tocopherol to placebo for four years and reported no effect on the progression of AMD in people already diagnosed with the condition. Another Cochrane review, same year, same authors, reviewed the literature on α-tocopherol preventing the development of AMD. This review identified four trials, duration 4–10 years, and reported no change to risk of developing AMD. A large clinical trial known as AREDS compared β-carotene (15 mg), vitamin C (500 mg), and α-tocopherol (400 IU) to placebo for up to ten years, with a conclusion that the anti-oxidant combination significantly slowed progression. However, because there was no group in the trial receiving only vitamin E, no conclusions could be drawn as to the contribution of the vitamin to the effect.

=== Complementary and alternative medicine ===
Proponents of megavitamin therapy and orthomolecular medicine advocate &quot;natural tocopherols.&quot; Meanwhile, clinical trials have largely concentrated on use of either a synthetic, all-racemic d-α-tocopheryl acetate or synthetic dl-α-tocopheryl acetate.

====Antioxidant theory====

Tocopherol is described as functioning as an antioxidant. A dose-ranging trial was conducted in people with chronic oxidative stress attributed to elevated serum cholesterol. Plasma F2-isoprostane concentration was selected as a biomarker of free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation. Only the two highest doses - 1600 and 3200 IU/day - significantly lowered F2-isoprostane.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) and vascular dementia are common causes of decline of brain functions that occur with age. AD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that worsens over time. The disease process is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. Vascular dementia may be caused by ischemic or hemorrhagic infarcts affecting multiple brain areas, including the anterior cerebral artery territory, the parietal lobes, or the cingulate gyrus. Both types of dementia may be present. Vitamin E status (and that of other antioxidant nutrients) is conjectured as having a possible impact on risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and vascular dementia. A review of dietary intake studies reported that higher consumption of vitamin E from foods lowered the risk of developing AD by 24%. A second review examined serum vitamin E levels and reported lower serum vitamin E in AD patients compared to healthy, age-matched people. In 2017 a consensus statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology included that until further information is available, vitamin E cannot be recommended for treatment or prevention of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Cancer===
From reviews of observational studies, diets higher in vitamin E content were associated with a lower relative risk of kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and lung cancer When comparisons were made between the lowest and highest groups for dietary vitamin E consumption from food, the average reductions in relative risk were in the range of 16-19%. For all of these reviews, the authors noted that the findings needed to be confirmed by prospective studies. From randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in which α-tocopherol was administered as a dietary supplement, results differed from the dietary intake reviews. A RCT of 400 IU/day of α-tocopherol did not reduce risk of bladder cancer. In male tobacco smokers, 50 mg/day had no impact on developing lung cancer. A review of RCTs for colorectal cancer reported lack of a statistically significant reduction in risk. In male tobacco smokers, 50 mg/day reduced prostate cancer risk by 32%, but in a different trial, majority non-smokers, 400 IU/day increased risk by 17%. In women who consumed either placebo or 600 IU of natural-source vitamin E on alternate days for an average of 10.1 years there were no significant differences for breast cancer, lung cancer, or colon cancer.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration initiated a process of reviewing and approving food and dietary supplement health claims in 1993. A Qualified Health Claim issued in 2012 allows product label claims that vitamin E may reduce risk of renal, bladder, and colorectal cancers, with a stipulation that the label must include a mandatory qualifier sentence: “FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence for this claim.” The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviews proposed health claims for the European Union countries. As of March 2018, EFSA has not evaluated any vitamin E and cancer prevention claims.

===Cataracts===
A meta-analysis from 2015 reported that for studies that reported serum tocopherol, higher serum concentration was associated with a 23% reduction in relative risk of age-related cataracts (ARC), with the effect due to differences in nuclear cataract rather than cortical or posterior subcapsular cataract - the three major classifications of age-related cataracts. However, this article and a second meta-analysis reporting on clinical trials of α-tocopherol supplementation reported no statistically significant change to risk of ARC when compared to placebo.

===Cardiovascular diseases===
Research on the effects of vitamin E on cardiovascular disease has produced conflicting results. An inverse relation has been observed between coronary heart disease and the consumption of foods high in vitamin E, and also higher serum concentration of α-tocopherol. In one of the largest observational studies, almost 90,000 healthy nurses were tracked for eight years. Compared to those in the lowest fifth for reported vitamin E consumption (from food and dietary supplements), those in the highest fifth were at a 34% lower risk of major coronary disease. Diet higher in vitamin E also may be higher in other, unidentified components that promote heart health, or people choosing such diets may be making other healthy lifestyle choices. There is some supporting evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). A meta-analysis on the effects of α-tocopherol supplementation in RCTs on aspects of cardiovascular health reported that when consumed without any other antioxidant nutrient, the relative risk of heart attack was reduced by 18%. The results were not consistent for all of the individual trials incorporated into the meta-analysis. For example, the Physicians&#x27; Health Study II did not show any benefit after 400 IU every other day for eight years, for heart attack, stroke, coronary mortality, or all-cause mortality. The effects of vitamin E supplementation on incidence of stroke were summarized in 2011. There were no significant benefits for vitamin E versus placebo for risk of stroke, or for subset analysis for ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, fatal stroke, or non-fatal stroke.

In 2001 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected proposed health claims for vitamin E and cardiovascular health. The U.S. National Institutes of Health also reviewed the literature and concluded there was not sufficient evidence to support the idea that routine use of vitamin E supplements prevents cardiovascular disease or reduces its morbidity and mortality. In 2010 the European Food Safety Authority reviewed and rejected claims that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of vitamin E and maintenance of normal cardiac function or of normal blood circulation.

=== Pregnancy===
Antioxidant vitamins as dietary supplements have been proposed as having benefits if consumed during pregnancy. For the combination of vitamin E with vitamin C supplemented to pregnant women, a Cochrane review of 21 clinical trials concluded that the data do not support vitamin E supplementation - majority of trials α-tocopherol at 400 IU/day plus vitamin C at 1000 mg/day - as being efficacious for reducing risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, preeclampsia, or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications. The review identified only three small trials in which vitamin E was supplemented without co-supplementation with vitamin C. None of these trials reported any clinically meaningful information.

=== Topical ===
Although there is widespread use of vitamin E as a topical medication, with claims for improved wound healing and reduced scar tissue, reviews have repeatedly concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support these claims.

==Side effects==
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board set a Tolerable upper intake level (UL) at 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) per day derived from animal models that demonstrated bleeding at high doses. The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set a UL at 300 mg/day. A meta-analysis of long-term clinical trials reported a non-significant 2% increase in all-cause mortality when α-tocopherol was the only supplement used. Another meta-analysis reported a non-significant 1% increase in all-cause mortality when α-tocopherol was the only supplement. Subset analysis reported no difference between natural (plant extracted) or synthetic α-tocopherol, or whether the amount used was less than or more than 400 IU/day. There are reports of vitamin E-induced allergic contact dermatitis from use of vitamin-E derivatives such as tocopheryl linoleate and tocopherol acetate in skin care products. Incidence is low despite widespread use.

===Drug interactions===
The amounts of α-tocopherol, other tocopherols and tocotrienols that are components of dietary vitamin E, when consumed from foods, do not appear to cause any interactions with drugs. Consumption of α-tocopherol as a dietary supplement in amounts in excess of 300 mg/day may lead to interactions with aspirin, warfarin, tamoxifen, and cyclosporine A in ways that alter function. For aspirin and warfarin, high amounts of vitamin E may potentiate anti-blood clotting action. One small trial demonstrated that vitamin E at 400 mg/day reduced blood concentration of the anti-breast cancer drug tamoxifen. In multiple clinical trials, vitamin E lowered blood concentration of the immuno-suppressant drug, cyclosporine A. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements, raises a concern that co-administration of vitamin E could counter the mechanisms of anti-cancer radiation therapy and some types of chemotherapy, and so advises against its use in these patient populations. The references it cited reported instances of reduced treatment adverse effects, but also poorer cancer survival, raising the possibility of tumor protection from the oxidative damage intended by the treatments.

==Synthesis==
Naturally sourced d-α-tocopherol can be extracted and purified from seed oils, or γ-tocopherol can be extracted, purified, and methylated to create d-alpha-tocopherol. In contrast to α-tocopherol extracted from plants, which also is called d-α-tocopherol, industrial synthesis creates dl-α-tocopherol. &quot;It is synthesized from a mixture of toluene and 2,3,5-trimethyl-hydroquinone that reacts with isophytol to all-rac-α-tocopherol, using iron in the presence of hydrogen chloride gas as a catalyst. The reaction mixture obtained is filtered and extracted with aqueous caustic soda. Toluene is removed by evaporation and the residue (all rac-α-tocopherol) is purified by vacuum distillation.&quot; Specification for the ingredient is &gt;97% pure. This synthetic dl-α-tocopherol has approximately 50% of the potency of d-α-tocopherol. Manufacturers of dietary supplements and fortified foods for humans or domesticated animals convert the phenol form of the vitamin to an ester using either acetic acid or succinic acid because the esters are more chemically stable, providing for a longer shelf-life. The ester forms are de-esterified in the gut and absorbed as free α-tocopherol.

==History==
During feeding experiments with rats Herbert McLean Evans concluded in 1922 that besides vitamins B and C, an unknown vitamin existed. Although every other nutrition was present, the rats were not fertile. This condition could be changed by additional feeding with wheat germ. It took several years until 1936 when the substance was isolated from wheat germ and the formula C29H50O2 was determined. Evans also found that the compound reacted like an alcohol and concluded that one of the oxygen atoms was part of an OH (hydroxyl) group. As noted in the introduction, the vitamin was given its name by Evans from Greek words meaning &quot;to bear young&quot; with the addition of the -ol as an alcohol.
The structure was determined shortly thereafter in 1938.
