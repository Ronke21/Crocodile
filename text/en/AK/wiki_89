<text>Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958April 21, 2016), known mononymously as Prince, was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation; he was known for his flamboyant, androgynous persona, wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams, as well as and his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his recordings. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&amp;B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz, blues, and hip hop. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound.

Born and raised in Minneapolis, Prince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 18, soon releasing the studio albums &quot;For You&quot; (1978) and &quot;Prince&quot; (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential albums &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; (1980), &quot;Controversy&quot; (1981), and &quot;1999&quot; (1982). In 1984, Prince became the first singer to simultaenously have a number-one film, album and single in the US, with the film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, its soundtrack and his first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart-topping single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;. The album, recorded with his new backing band the Revolution, spent six consecutive months atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. The movie grossed $70.3 million worldwide and it has been regarded as one of the greatest musical films. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince released the album &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; (1987), widely hailed by critics as the greatest work of his career.

In 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol (known to fans as the &quot;Love Symbol&quot;) and was often referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or TAFKAP) or simply The Artist. After moving to Arista Records in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was a prolific musician who released 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased material left in a custom-built bank vault underneath his home, including fully completed albums and over 50 finished music videos. Numerous posthumous collections of his previously unheard work have been issued by his estate.

Prince has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards include the Grammy President&#x27;s Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Icon Award, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016, and was inducted twice into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022. Estimates of the complete number of songs written by Prince range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000.

== Early life ==
Prince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis on June 7, 1958, the son of jazz singer Mattie Della (née Shaw) and pianist and songwriter John Lewis Nelson. All four of his grandparents were from Louisiana. His grand-aunt was the black nationalist Mittie Maude Lena Gordon, who established the Peace Movement of Ethiopia and advocated emigration to West Africa in response to American white supremacy. The jazz drummer Louis Hayes was his paternal cousin.

Prince was named after his father&#x27;s most popular stage name, Prince Rogers, which his father used while performing with Prince&#x27;s mother in a jazz group called the Prince Rogers Trio. In 1991, Prince&#x27;s father told &quot;A Current Affair&quot; that he named his son &quot;Prince&quot; because he wanted Prince &quot;to do everything I wanted to do&quot;. Prince was not fond of his name and wanted people to instead call him &quot;Skipper&quot;, a name which stuck throughout his childhood. Prince said he was &quot;born epileptic&quot; and had seizures when he was young. He stated, &quot;My mother told me one day I walked in to her and said, &#x27;Mom, I&#x27;m not going to be sick anymore,&#x27; and she said, &#x27;Why?&#x27; and I said, &#x27;Because an angel told me so. Prince&#x27;s younger sister, Tyka, was born on May 18, 1960. Both siblings developed a keen interest in music, which was encouraged by their father. His parents were both members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, an evangelical denomination.

In 2022, during a Minneapolis teachers&#x27; strike, Minneapolis-St. Paul news station WCCO-TV was researching a previous teacher&#x27;s strike in April 1970 and accidentally uncovered an interview they had done with Prince about that 1970 strike. Prince, who was 11 years old at the time, said about the strike, &quot;I think they should get a better education too cause, um, and I think they should get some more money cause they work, they be working extra hours for us and all that stuff.&quot; While he never identifies himself in the interview, it was confirmed to be him through interviews with a historian in Minneapolis who is also a fan of Prince, as well as by a former classmate who was a member of Prince&#x27;s first band. The video is one of very few videos of Prince from that stage of his life.

Prince wrote his first song, &quot;Funk Machine&quot;, on his father&#x27;s piano when he was seven years old. His parents divorced when he was 10. His mother remarried Hayward Baker, with whom she had a son named Omarr; Prince had a fraught relationship with Omarr, to the extent that it caused him to repeatedly switch homes, sometimes living with his father and sometimes with his mother and stepfather. Baker took Prince to see James Brown in concert, and Prince credited Baker with improving the family&#x27;s finances. After a brief period of living with his father, who bought him his first guitar, Prince moved into the basement of the Anderson family, a neighbor, after his father threw him out. He befriended the Andersons&#x27; son, Andre, who later collaborated with Prince and became known as André Cymone.

Prince attended Minneapolis&#x27;s Bryant Junior High, where he helped test the original &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;, then Central High School, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He played on Central&#x27;s junior varsity basketball team, and continued to play basketball for fun as an adult. He was trained in classical ballet at the Minnesota Dance Theatre through the Urban Arts Program of Minneapolis Public Schools, Prince became an advocate for dancers, and used his wealth to save the failing Joffrey Ballet in Chicago during the 1990s. He met songwriter and producer Jimmy Jam in 1973 and impressed Jam with his musical talent, early mastery of a wide range of instruments, and work ethic.

== Career ==
=== 1975–1984: Beginnings and breakthrough ===
In 1975, Pepe Willie (the husband of Prince&#x27;s cousin Shauntel), formed the band 94 East with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry, hiring André Cymone and Prince to record tracks. Willie wrote the songs, and Prince contributed guitar tracks, and Prince and Willie co-wrote the 94 East song, &quot;Just Another Sucker&quot;. The band recorded tracks which later became the album &quot;Minneapolis Genius – The Historic 1977 Recordings&quot;. In 1976, shortly after graduating from Central High School, Prince created a demo tape with producer Chris Moon, in Moon&#x27;s Minneapolis studio. Unable to secure a recording contract, Moon brought the tape to Owen Husney, a Minneapolis businessman, who signed Prince, aged 19, to a management contract, and helped him create a demo at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis (with producer/engineer David Z). The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney&#x27;s ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies, including Warner Bros. Records, A&amp;M Records, and Columbia Records.

With the help of Husney, Prince signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1977. The record company agreed to give Prince creative control for three albums and retain his publishing rights. Husney and Prince then left Minneapolis and moved to Sausalito, California, where Prince&#x27;s first album, &quot;For You&quot;, was recorded at Record Plant Studios. The album was mixed in Los Angeles and released on April 7, 1978. According to the &quot;For You&quot; album notes, Prince wrote, produced, arranged, composed, and played all 27 instruments on the recording, except for the song &quot;Soft and Wet&quot;, whose lyrics were co-written by Moon. The cost of recording the album was twice Prince&#x27;s initial advance. Prince used the &quot;Prince&#x27;s Music Co.&quot; to publish his songs. In the United States, &quot;Soft and Wet&quot; reached No. 12 on the Hot Soul Singles chart and No. 92 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song &quot;Just as Long as We&#x27;re Together&quot; reached No. 91 on the Hot Soul Singles chart.

Around this time, a side enterprise that Prince began to pursue involved a then-teenage singer Sue Ann Carwell, whose career as a solo artist he hoped to mould after hearing her talented performance on the Minneapolis R&amp;B scene; however, Carwell resisted his suggestion that she used the name &quot;Susie Stone&quot;, and recordings he had been working on with her for a projected 1978 album (&quot;I&#x27;m Saving It Up&quot;, &quot;Make It Through the Storm&quot;, &quot;Since We&#x27;ve Been Together&quot; and &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t You Love To Love Me?&quot;) went unreleased. Carwell was subsequently signed by Warner Bros. Records.

In 1979, Prince created a band with André Cymone on bass, Dez Dickerson on guitar, Gayle Chapman and Doctor Fink on keyboards, and Bobby Z. on drums. Their first show was at the Capri Theater on January 5, 1979. Warner Bros. executives attended the show but decided that Prince and the band needed more time to develop his music. In October 1979, Prince released the album &quot;Prince&quot;, which was No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Black Albums charts and No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and went platinum. It contained two R&amp;B hits: &quot;Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Lover&quot;, which sold more than a million copies, and reached No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 for two weeks on the Hot Soul Singles chart. Prince performed both these songs on January 26, 1980, on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. On this album, Prince used &quot;Ecnirp Music – BMI&quot;.

In 1980, Prince released the album &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, which contained sexually explicit material, including the title song, &quot;Head&quot;, and the song &quot;Sister&quot;, and was described by Stephen Thomas Erlewine as a &quot;stunning, audacious amalgam of funk, new wave, R&amp;B, and pop, fueled by grinningly salacious sex and the desire to shock&quot;. Recorded in Prince&#x27;s studio, this album was certified gold, and the single &quot;Uptown&quot; reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance chart and No. 5 on the Hot Soul Singles chart. Prince was also the opening act for Rick James&#x27; 1980 &quot;Fire It Up&quot; tour.

In February 1981, Prince made his first appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, performing &quot;Partyup&quot;. In October 1981, Prince released the album &quot;Controversy&quot;. He played several dates in support of it, as the first of three opening acts for the Rolling Stones, on their US tour. In Los Angeles, Prince, who appeared in a trench coat and black bikini briefs, was forced off the stage after just three songs by audience members throwing trash at him. He began 1982 with a small tour of college towns where he was the headlining act. The songs on &quot;Controversy&quot; were published by &quot;Controversy Music&quot; – &quot;ASCAP&quot;, a practice he continued until the &quot;Emancipation&quot; album in 1996. &quot;Controversy&quot; also marked the introduction of Prince&#x27;s use of abbreviated spelling, such as writing the words &quot;you&quot; as &quot;U&quot;, &quot;to&quot; as &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;for&quot; as &quot;4&quot;; by 2002, MTV News noted that &quot;[n]ow all of his titles, liner notes, and Web postings are written in his own shorthand spelling, as seen on 1999&#x27;s &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot;, which featured &#x27;Hot Wit U.

In 1981, Prince formed a side project band called the Time. The band released four albums between 1981 and 1990, with Prince writing and performing most of the instrumentation and backing vocals (sometimes credited under the pseudonyms &quot;Jamie Starr&quot; or &quot;The Starr Company&quot;), with lead vocals by Morris Day.

In late 1982, Prince released a double album, &quot;1999&quot;, which sold more than four million copies. The title track was a protest against nuclear proliferation and became Prince&#x27;s first top 10 hit in countries outside the US. Prince&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; was one of the first two videos by black artists (along with Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Billie Jean&quot;) played in heavy rotation on MTV, which had been perceived as against &quot;black music&quot; until CBS President Walter Yetnikoff threatened to pull all CBS videos. Prince and Jackson had a competitive rivalry which lasted for many years. The song &quot;Delirious&quot; also placed in the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;International Lover&quot; earned Prince his first Grammy Award nomination at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards.

=== 1984–1987: &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot; and &quot;Parade&quot; ===
 During this period Prince referred to his band as the Revolution. The band&#x27;s name was also printed, in reverse, on the cover of &quot;1999&quot; inside the letter &quot;I&quot; of the word &quot;Prince&quot;. The band consisted of Lisa Coleman and Doctor Fink on keyboards, Bobby Z. on drums, Brown Mark on bass, and Dez Dickerson on guitar. Jill Jones, a backing singer, was also part of the lineup for the &quot;1999&quot; album and tour. Following the 1999 Tour, Dickerson left the group for religious reasons. In the book &quot;Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince&quot; (2003), author Alex Hahn says that Dickerson was reluctant to sign a three-year contract and wanted to pursue other musical ventures. Dickerson was replaced by Coleman&#x27;s friend Wendy Melvoin. At first, the band was used sparsely in the studio, but this gradually changed during 1983.
According to his former manager Bob Cavallo, in the early 1980s Prince required his management to obtain a deal for him to star in a major motion picture, even though his exposure at that point was limited to several pop and R&amp;B hits, music videos and occasional TV performances. This resulted in the hit film &quot;Purple Rain&quot; (1984), which starred Prince and was loosely autobiographical, and the eponymous studio album, which was also the soundtrack to the film. The &quot;Purple Rain&quot; album sold more than 13 million copies in the US and spent 24 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The film won Prince an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and grossed more than $68 million in the US ($ million in dollars). Songs from the film were hits on pop charts around the world; &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot; reached No. 1, and the title track reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. At one point in 1984, Prince simultaneously had the No. 1 album, single, and film in the US; it was the first time a singer had achieved this feat. The &quot;Purple Rain&quot; album is ranked 8th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;; it is also included on the list of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s All-Time 100 Albums. The album also produced two of Prince&#x27;s first three Grammy Awards earned at the 27th Annual Grammy Awards—Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.

In 1984, pop artist Andy Warhol created the painting &quot;Orange Prince&quot;. Warhol was fascinated by Prince and ultimately created a total of twelve unique paintings of him in different colorways, all of which were kept in Warhol&#x27;s personal collection. Four of these paintings are now in the collection of The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. In November 1984, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published Warhol&#x27;s portrait to accompany the article &quot;Purple Fame&quot; by Tristan Fox, and claimed that Warhol&#x27;s silkscreen image of Prince with its pop colors captured the recording artist &quot;at the height of his powers&quot;. The &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article was one of the first global media pieces written as a critical appreciation of the musician, which coincided with the start of the 98-date Purple Rain Tour.

After Tipper Gore heard her 11-year-old daughter Karenna listening to Prince&#x27;s song &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; (which gained wide notoriety for its sexual lyrics and a reference to masturbation), she founded the Parents Music Resource Center. The center advocated the mandatory use of a warning label (&quot;Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics&quot;) on the covers of records that have been judged to contain language or lyrical content unsuitable for minors. The recording industry later voluntarily complied with this request.

In 1985, Prince announced that he would discontinue live performances and music videos after the release of his next album. His subsequent recording, &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot; (1985), held the No. 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for three weeks. From that album, the single &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot; reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and &quot;Pop Life&quot; reached No. 7.

In 1986, his album &quot;Parade&quot; reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 2 on the R&amp;B charts. The first single, &quot;Kiss&quot;, with the video choreographed by Louis Falco, reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. (The song was originally written for a side project called Mazarati.) In the same year, the song &quot;Manic Monday&quot;, written by Prince and recorded by the Bangles, reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 chart. The album &quot;Parade&quot; served as the soundtrack for Prince&#x27;s second film, &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot; (1986). Prince directed and starred in the movie, which also featured Kristin Scott Thomas. Although the &quot;Parade&quot; album went platinum and sold two million copies, the film &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot; received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture (tied with &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;), and Prince received Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Director, Worst Actor, and Worst Original Song (for the song &quot;Love or Money&quot;). Some critics later re-evaluated &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot; after Prince&#x27;s death and declared it a cult classic, comparing it to films such as &quot;8½&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;.

In 1986, Prince began a series of live performances called the Hit n Run – Parade Tour. After the tour, Prince disbanded the Revolution and fired Wendy &amp; Lisa. Brown Mark quit the band; keyboardist Doctor Fink remained. Prince recruited new band members Miko Weaver on guitar, Atlanta Bliss on trumpet, and Eric Leeds on saxophone.

=== 1987–1991: &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot;, &quot;Lovesexy&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot; ===
Before disbanding the Revolution, Prince was working on two separate projects, the Revolution album &quot;Dream Factory&quot; and a solo effort, &quot;Camille&quot;. Unlike the three previous band albums, &quot;Dream Factory&quot; included input from the band members and featured songs with lead vocals by Wendy &amp; Lisa. The &quot;Camille&quot; project saw Prince create a new androgynous persona primarily singing in a sped-up, female-sounding voice. With the dismissal of the Revolution, Prince consolidated material from both shelved albums, along with some new songs, into a three-LP album to be titled &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;. Warner Bros. forced Prince to trim the triple album to a double album, and &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; was released on March 31, 1987.

The album peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. The first single, &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot;, charted at No. 3 on the Hot 100. The follow-up single, &quot;If I Was Your Girlfriend&quot;, charted at No. 67 on the Hot 100 but went to No. 12 on R&amp;B chart. The third single, a duet with Sheena Easton, &quot;U Got the Look&quot;, charted at No. 2 on the Hot 100 and No. 11 on the R&amp;B chart, and the final single, &quot;I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man&quot;, finished at No. 10 on Hot 100 and No. 14 on the R&amp;B chart.

It was named the top album of the year by the Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll and sold 3.2 million copies. In Europe, it performed well, and Prince promoted the album overseas with a lengthy tour. Putting together a new backing band from the remnants of the Revolution, Prince added bassist Levi Seacer Jr., keyboardist Boni Boyer, and dancer/choreographer Cat Glover to go with new drummer Sheila E and holdovers Miko Weaver, Doctor Fink, Eric Leeds, Atlanta Bliss, and the Bodyguards (Jerome, Wally Safford, and Greg Brooks) for the Sign o&#x27; the Times Tour.

The Sign o&#x27; the Times tour was a success overseas, with Warner Bros. and Prince&#x27;s managers wanting to bring it to the US to promote sales of the album. Prince balked at a full US tour, as he was ready to produce a new album. As a compromise, the last two nights of the tour were filmed for release in movie theaters. The film quality was deemed subpar, and reshoots were performed at Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park studios. The film &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; was released on November 20, 1987. The film got better reviews than &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot;, but its box-office receipts were minimal, and it quickly left theaters.

The next album intended for release was &quot;The Black Album&quot;. More instrumental and funk- and R&amp;B-themed than recent releases, &quot;The Black Album&quot; also saw Prince experiment with hip hop on the songs &quot;Bob George&quot; and &quot;Dead on It&quot;. Prince was set to release the album with a monochromatic black cover with only the catalog number printed, but after 500,000 copies had been pressed, Prince had a spiritual epiphany that the album was evil and had it recalled. It was later released by Warner Bros. as a limited edition album in 1994.

Prince went back in the studio for eight weeks and recorded &quot;Lovesexy&quot;. Released on May 10, 1988, &quot;Lovesexy&quot; serves as a spiritual opposite to the dark &quot;The Black Album&quot;. Every song is a solo effort by Prince, except &quot;Eye No&quot;, which was recorded with his backing band at the time. &quot;Lovesexy&quot; reached No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 5 on the R&amp;B albums chart. The lead single, &quot;Alphabet St.&quot;, peaked at No. 8 on the Hot 100 and No. 3 on the R&amp;B chart; it sold 750,000 copies.

Prince again took his post-Revolution backing band (minus the Bodyguards) on a three-leg, 84-show Lovesexy World Tour; although the shows were well-received by huge crowds, they failed to make a net profit due to the expensive sets and props.

In 1989, Prince appeared on Madonna&#x27;s studio album &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, co-writing and singing the duet &quot;Love Song&quot; and playing electric guitar (uncredited) on the songs &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, &quot;Keep It Together&quot;, and &quot;Act of Contrition&quot;. He also began work on several musical projects, including &quot;Rave Unto the Joy Fantastic&quot; and early drafts of his &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot; film, but both were put on hold when he was asked by &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) director Tim Burton to record several songs for the upcoming live-action adaptation. Prince went into the studio and produced an entire nine-track album that Warner Bros. released on June 20, 1989. &quot;Batman&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 4.3 million copies. The single &quot;Batdance&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts.

The single &quot;The Arms of Orion&quot;, with Sheena Easton, charted at No. 36, and &quot;Partyman&quot; (also featuring the vocals of Prince&#x27;s then-girlfriend, nicknamed Anna Fantastic) charted at No. 18 on the Hot 100 and at No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart, while the love ballad &quot;Scandalous!&quot; went to No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart. Prince had to sign away all publishing rights to the songs on the album to Warner Bros. as part of the deal to do the soundtrack.

In 1990, Prince went back on tour with a revamped band for his back-to-basics Nude Tour. With the departures of Boni Boyer, Sheila E., the Horns, and Cat, Prince brought in keyboardist Rosie Gaines, drummer Michael Bland, and dancing trio the Game Boyz (Tony M., Kirky J., and Damon Dickson). The European and Japanese tour was a financial success with a short, greatest hits setlist. As the year progressed, Prince finished production on his fourth film, &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot; (1990), and the 1990 album &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot;. Initially, Warner Bros. was reluctant to fund the film, but with Prince&#x27;s assurances it would be a sequel to &quot;Purple Rain&quot; as well as the involvement of the original members of the Time, the studio greenlit the project. Released on August 20, 1990, the album reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and R&amp;B albums chart. The single &quot;Thieves in the Temple&quot; reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart; &quot;Round and Round&quot; placed at No. 12 on the US charts and No. 2 on the R&amp;B charts. The song featured the teenage Tevin Campbell (who also had a role in the film) on lead vocals. The film, released on November 20, 1990, was a box-office flop, grossing $4.2 million. After the release of the film and album, the last remaining members of the Revolution, Miko Weaver, and Doctor Fink, left Prince&#x27;s band.

=== 1991–1996: Name change, &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; and &quot;The Gold Experience&quot; ===
1991 began with a performance in Rock in Rio II and marked the debut of Prince&#x27;s new band, the New Power Generation. With guitarist Miko Weaver and long-time keyboardist Doctor Fink gone, Prince added bass player Sonny T., Tommy Barbarella on keyboards, and a brass section known as the Hornheads to go along with Levi Seacer (taking over on guitar), Rosie Gaines, Michael Bland, and the Game Boyz. With significant input from his band members, &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; was released on October 1, 1991. Reaching No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; saw four hit singles released in the United States. &quot;Gett Off&quot; peaked at No. 21 on the Hot 100 and No. 6 on the R&amp;B charts, followed by &quot;Cream&quot;, which gave Prince his fifth US No. 1 single. The title track &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; became the album&#x27;s third single, reaching No. 3 on the Hot 100 and the top spot on the R&amp;B charts. &quot;Money Don&#x27;t Matter 2 Night&quot; peaked at No. 23 and No. 14 on the Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts respectively. &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; would sell more than 2 million copies in the United States alone.

In 1992, following the success of &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot;, Prince renewed his contract with Warner Bros., agreeing to what was reportedly a $100 million deal to release six more albums with the label. In November, Prince released his 14th studio album, the second to feature the New Power Generation. It bore only an unpronounceable symbol on the cover (later copyrighted as &quot;Love Symbol #2&quot;) as its title; the symbol was explained as being a combination of the symbols for male (♂) and female (♀). It was preceded by the releases of &quot;Sexy MF&quot; and &quot;My Name Is Prince&quot;, which reached No.66 and No. 36 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The third single &quot;7&quot; would peak at No.7. The album, later referred to as &quot;Love Symbol&quot;, peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and went on to sell 2.8 million copies worldwide, falling short of expectations.

In 1993, in rebellion against Warner Bros., which refused to release Prince&#x27;s enormous backlog of music at a steady pace, Prince formally adopted the &quot;Love Symbol&quot; as his stage name. To use the symbol in print media, Warner Bros. organized a mass mailing of floppy disks with a custom font. At this time, Prince was often referred to as &quot;the Artist Formerly Known as Prince&quot; or &quot;the Artist&quot;. That same year, Warner Bros. released a greatest hits compilation with the three-disc &quot;The Hits/The B-Sides&quot; in 1993. The first two discs were also sold separately as &quot;The Hits 1&quot; and &quot;The Hits 2&quot;. The collection features the majority of Prince&#x27;s hit singles, and several previously hard-to-find recordings, including B-sides from across Prince&#x27;s career and previously unreleased tracks such as the Revolution-recorded &quot;Power Fantastic&quot; and a live recording of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot; with Rosie Gaines. Two new songs, &quot;Pink Cashmere&quot; and &quot;Peach&quot;, were chosen as promotional singles.

In 1994, Warner Bros. allowed the single &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; to be released via a small, independent distributor, Bellmark Records, in February. The release reached No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 in many other countries. Prince began to release albums in quick succession as a means of releasing himself from his contractual obligations to Warner Bros. This led to the previously aborted &quot;Black Album&quot; being given a limited official release seven years after its initial recording. Prince pushed to have his next two albums, &quot;Come&quot; and &quot;The Gold Experience&quot;, released simultaneously. Warner Bros. accepted both albums, but delayed the release of &quot;The Gold Experience&quot;, fearing market saturation. In retaliation, Prince began making public appearances with &quot;slave&quot; written on his face. &quot;The Gold Experience&quot; would not be released until September 1995. The album was not in print for a long period due to a plagiarism case relating to &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot;, but the album was released on streaming with Prince’s catalog in 2018, and reissued on CD and vinyl in 2022.

In 1996, the album &quot;Chaos and Disorder&quot; was released. Prince submitted another album titled &quot;The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale&quot; to Warner Bros. that same year, completing his contract with the label. Although the album was not released until 1999, Warner Bros. agreed to release Prince from his contract now that he had delivered the promised number of albums to them.

=== 1996–2000: &quot;Emancipation&quot;, &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; and &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot; ===
Free of any further contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Prince attempted a major comeback later that year with the release of &quot;Emancipation&quot;, a 36-song, three-CD set (each disc was exactly 60 minutes long). The album was released via his own NPG Records with distribution through EMI. To publish his songs on &quot;Emancipation&quot;, Prince did not use &quot;Controversy Music&quot; – &quot;ASCAP&quot;, which he had used for all his records since 1981, but rather used &quot;Emancipated Music Inc.&quot; – &quot;ASCAP&quot;.

&quot;Emancipation&quot; was certified Platinum by the RIAA. It is the first Prince record featuring covers of other artists&#x27; songs: Joan Osborne&#x27;s top ten hit song of 1995 &quot;One of Us&quot;; &quot;Betcha by Golly Wow!&quot; (written by Thom Bell and Linda Creed); &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make You Love Me&quot; (written by James Allen Shamblin II and Michael Barry Reid); and &quot;La-La (Means I Love You)&quot; (written by Thom Bell and William Hart).

Prince released &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;, a five-CD collection of unreleased material, in 1998. The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was shipped; these pre-orders were delivered months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The retail edition has only four discs, as it is missing the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; disc. There are also two different packaging editions for retail; one is a four-disc sized jewel case with a white cover and the Love Symbol in a colored circle while the other contains all four discs in a round translucent snap jewel case. The discs are the same, as is the CD jacket. The &quot;Newpower Soul&quot; album was released three months later. His collaborations on Chaka Khan&#x27;s &quot;Come 2 My House&quot; and Larry Graham&#x27;s &quot;GCS2000&quot;, both released on the NPG label around the same time as &quot;Newpower Soul&quot;, were promoted by live appearances on &quot;Vibe with Sinbad&quot; and the NBC &quot;Today&quot; show&#x27;s Summer Concert Series.

In 1999, Prince once again signed with a major label, Arista Records, to release a new record, &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot;.

The pay-per-view concert, &quot;Rave Un2 the Year 2000&quot;, was broadcast on December 31, 1999, and consisted of footage from the December 17 and 18 concerts of his 1999 tour. The concert featured appearances by guest musicians, including Lenny Kravitz, George Clinton, Jimmy Russell, and the Time. It was released to home video the following year.

=== 2000–2007: &quot;Musicology&quot; and &quot;3121&quot; ===
On May 16, 2000, Prince stopped using the Love Symbol as his name, since his publishing contract with Warner/Chappell had expired. In a press conference, he stated that after being freed from undesirable relationships associated with the name &quot;Prince&quot;, he would revert to using his real name. Nevertheless, Prince continued to use the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and to play a Love Symbol–shaped guitar. For several years following the release of &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot;, Prince primarily released new music through his Internet subscription service, NPGOnlineLtd.com, which later became NPGMusicClub.com. Albums from this period are &quot;Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic&quot; (2001), &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; (2001), &quot;One Nite Alone...&quot; (2002), &quot;Xpectation&quot; (2003), &quot;C-Note&quot; (2004), &quot;The Chocolate Invasion&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Slaughterhouse&quot; (2004).

In 2001, Warner Bros. released a second compilation album, &quot;The Very Best of Prince&quot;, containing most of his commercially successful singles from the 1980s. In 2002, Prince released his first live album, &quot;One Nite Alone... Live!&quot;, which features performances from the One Nite Alone...Tour. The three-CD box set also includes a disc of &quot;aftershow&quot; music entitled &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over!&quot;. During this time, Prince sought to engage more effectively with his fan base via the NPG Music Club, pre-concert sound checks, and at yearly &quot;celebrations&quot; at Paisley Park, his music studios. Fans were invited into the studio for tours, interviews, discussions and music-listening sessions. Some of these fan discussions were filmed for an unreleased documentary, directed by Kevin Smith.

On February 8, 2004, Prince appeared at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards with Beyoncé. In a performance that opened the show, they performed a medley of &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;, &quot;Baby I&#x27;m a Star&quot;, and Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;. The following month, Prince was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The award was presented to him by Alicia Keys along with Big Boi and André 3000 of OutKast. As well as performing a trio of his own hits during the ceremony, Prince also participated in a tribute to fellow inductee George Harrison in a rendering of Harrison&#x27;s &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, playing a two-minute guitar solo that ended the song. He also performed the song &quot;Red House&quot; as &quot;Purple House&quot; on the album &quot;Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot;.

In April 2004, Prince released &quot;Musicology&quot; through a one-album agreement with Columbia. The album rose as high as the top five on some international charts (including the US, UK, Germany, and Australia). The US chart success was assisted by the CDs being included as part of the concert ticket purchase, thereby qualifying each CD (as chart rules then stood) to count toward US chart placement. Three months later, &quot;Spin&quot; named him the greatest frontman of all time. That same year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named Prince as the highest-earning musician in the world, with an annual income of $56.5 million, largely due to his Musicology Tour, which Pollstar named as the top concert draw among musicians in the US. He played 96 concerts; the average ticket price for a show was US$61 (). &quot;Musicology&quot; went on to receive two Grammy wins, for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;Call My Name&quot; and Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the title track. &quot;Musicology&quot; was also nominated for Best R&amp;B Song and Best R&amp;B Album, and &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Prince No. 27 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

In April 2005, Prince played guitar (along with En Vogue singing backing vocals) on Stevie Wonder&#x27;s single &quot;So What the Fuss&quot;, Wonder&#x27;s first since 1999. In late 2005, Prince signed with Universal Music to release his album, &quot;3121&quot;, on March 21, 2006. The first single was &quot;Te Amo Corazón&quot;, the video for which was directed by actress Salma Hayek and filmed in Marrakech, Morocco, featuring Argentine actress and singer Mía Maestro. The video for the second single, &quot;Black Sweat&quot;, was nominated at the MTV VMAs for Best Cinematography. The immediate success of &quot;3121&quot; gave Prince his first No. 1 debut on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with the album.

To promote the new album, Prince was the musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on February 4, 2006, 17 years after his last &quot;SNL&quot; appearance on the 15th-anniversary special, and nearly 25 years since his first appearance on a regular episode in 1981. At the 2006 Webby Awards on June 12, Prince received a Webby Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his &quot;visionary use of the Internet to distribute music and connect with audiences&quot;, exemplified by his decision to release his album &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; (1998) exclusively online.

In July 2006, weeks after winning a Webby Award, Prince shut down his NPG Music Club website, after more than five years of operation. On the day of the music club&#x27;s shutdown, a lawsuit was filed against Prince by the British company HM Publishing (owners of the Nature Publishing Group, also NPG). Despite these events occurring on the same day, Prince&#x27;s attorney stated that the site did not close due to the trademark dispute.

Prince appeared at multiple award ceremonies in 2006: on February 15, he performed at the 2006 Brit Awards, along with Wendy &amp; Lisa and Sheila E., and on June 27, Prince appeared at the 2006 BET Awards, where he was awarded Best Male R&amp;B Artist. Prince performed a medley of Chaka Khan songs for Khan&#x27;s BET Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2006, he was invited to dub the Prince XII cat in the film &quot;&quot;, but gave up for unknown reasons and was replaced by actor Tim Curry.

In November 2006, Prince was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame; he appeared to collect his award but did not perform. Also in November 2006, Prince opened a nightclub called 3121, in Las Vegas at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino. He performed weekly on Friday and Saturday nights until April 2007, when his contract with the Rio ended. On August 22, 2006, Prince released &quot;Ultimate Prince&quot;. The double-disc set contains one CD of previous hits, and another of extended versions and mixes of material that had largely only previously been available on vinyl record B-sides. That same year, Prince wrote and performed a song for the hit animated film &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006). The song – &quot;The Song of the Heart&quot; – appears on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, which also features a cover of Prince&#x27;s earlier hit &quot;Kiss&quot;, sung by Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. In January 2007, &quot;The Song of the Heart&quot; won a Golden Globe for Best Original Song.

=== 2007–2010: Super Bowl XLI show, &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and &quot;Lotusflower&quot; ===

On February 4, 2007, Prince played at the Super Bowl XLI halftime show in Miami, Florida, on a large stage shaped like his symbol. The event was carried to 140 million television viewers, his biggest-ever audience. His 12-minute performance in the rain began with an intro of the Queen song &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and concluded with &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it the greatest Super Bowl performance ever.

Prince played 21 concerts at the O2 Arena in London during the Earth Tour in mid-2007. Tickets for the 20,000-capacity venue were capped by Prince at £31.21 ($48.66). Featuring Maceo Parker in his band, Prince&#x27;s residency at the O2 Arena was increased to 15 nights after all 140,000 tickets for the original seven sold out in 20 minutes, before it was then further extended to 21 nights.

Prince performed with Sheila E. at the 2007 ALMA Awards. On June 28, 2007, the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; stated that it had made a deal to give Prince&#x27;s new album, &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, away for free with the paper, making it the first place in the world to get the album. This move sparked controversy among music distributors and also led the UK arm of Prince&#x27;s distributor, Sony BMG, to withdraw from distributing the album in UK stores. The UK&#x27;s largest high street music retailer, HMV, stocked the paper on release day due to the giveaway. On July 7, 2007, Prince returned to Minneapolis to perform three shows. He performed concerts at the Macy&#x27;s Auditorium (to promote his new perfume &quot;3121&quot;) on Nicollet Mall, the Target Center arena, and First Avenue. It was the first time he had played at First Avenue (the club appeared in the film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;) since 1987.
From 2008, Prince was managed by UK-based Kiran Sharma. On April 25, 2008, Prince performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, where he debuted a new song, &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;. Days after, he headlined the 2008 Coachella Festival. Prince was paid more than $5 million for his performance at Coachella, according to Reuters. Prince canceled a concert, planned at Dublin&#x27;s Croke Park on June 16, 2008, at 10 days&#x27; notice. In October 2009 promoters MCD Productions went to court to sue him for €1.6 million to refund 55,126 tickets. Prince settled the case out of court in February 2010 for $2.95 million. During the trial, it was said that Prince had been offered $22 million for seven concerts as part of a proposed 2008 European tour. In October 2008, Prince released a live album entitled &quot;Indigo Nights&quot;, a collection of songs performed live at aftershows in the IndigO2.

Prince premiered four songs from his new album on LA&#x27;s Indie rock radio station Indie 103.1 on December 18, 2008. The radio station&#x27;s programmers Max Tolkoff and Mark Sovel had been invited to Prince&#x27;s home to hear the new rock-oriented music. Prince gave them a CD with four songs to premiere on their radio station. The music debuted the next day on Jonesy&#x27;s Jukebox, hosted by former Sex Pistol Steve Jones.

On January 3, 2009, the new website LotusFlow3r.com was launched; streaming and selling some of the recently aired material and concert tickets. On January 31, Prince released two more songs on LotusFlow3r.com: &quot;Disco Jellyfish&quot;, and &quot;Another Boy&quot;. &quot;Chocolate Box&quot;, &quot;Colonized Mind&quot;, and &quot;All This Love&quot; were later released on the website. Prince released a triple album set containing &quot;Lotusflower&quot;, &quot;MPLSoUND&quot;, and an album credited to Bria Valente, called &quot;Elixer&quot;, on March 24, 2009, followed by a physical release on March 29.

On July 18, 2009, Prince performed two shows at the Montreux Jazz Festival, backed by the New Power Generation, including Rhonda Smith, Renato Neto and John Blackwell. On October 11, 2009, he gave two surprise concerts at the Grand Palais in Paris. On October 12, he gave another surprise performance at La Cigale. On October 24, Prince played a concert at Paisley Park.

=== 2010–2016: Final albums ===
In January 2010, Prince wrote a new song, &quot;Purple and Gold&quot;, inspired by his visit to a Minnesota Vikings football game against the Dallas Cowboys. The following month, he let Minneapolis-St. Paul public radio station 89.3 The Current premiere his new song &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; as a gesture in support of independent radio.

In 2010, Prince was listed in &quot;Time&quot;″s annual ranking of the &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World&quot;. He released a new single on Minneapolis-St. Paul radio station 89.3 The Current called &quot;Hot Summer&quot; on June 7, his 52nd birthday. The same month, Prince appeared on the cover of the July 2010 issue of &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine, and he received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2010 BET Awards.

Prince released his album &quot;20Ten&quot; in July 2010 as a free covermount with publications in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and France. He refused album access to digital download services and closed LotusFlow3r.com. On July 4, 2010, Prince began his 20Ten Tour, a concert tour in two legs, with shows in Europe. The second leg began on October 15 and ended with a concert following the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on November 14. The second half of the tour had a new band, John Blackwell, Ida Kristine Nielsen, and Sheila E. Prince let radio station Europe 1 debut the snippet of his new song &quot;Rich Friends&quot; from the new album &quot;20Ten Deluxe&quot; on October 8, 2010. He embarked on the Welcome 2 Tour on December 15, 2010. Prince was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame on December 7, 2010.
Prince presented Barbra Streisand with an award and donated $1.5 million to charities on February 12, 2011. On the same day, it was reported that he had not authorized the television show &quot;Glee&quot; to cover his hit &quot;Kiss&quot;, in an episode that had already been filmed. Prince headlined the Hop Farm Festival on July 3, 2011, marking his first UK show since 2007 and his first-ever UK festival appearance. Despite having previously rejected the Internet for music distribution, on November 24, 2011, he released a reworked version of the previously unreleased song &quot;Extraloveable&quot; through both iTunes and Spotify. Purple Music, a Switzerland-based record label, released a CD single titled &quot;Dance 4 Me&quot; on December 12, 2011, as part of a club remixes package including the Bria Valente CD single &quot;2 Nite&quot; released on February 23, 2012. The CD features club remixes by Jamie Lewis and David Alexander, produced by Prince.

In January 2013, Prince released a lyric video for a new song called &quot;Screwdriver&quot;. In April 2013, Prince announced a West Coast tour titled Live Out Loud Tour with 3rdeyegirl as his backing band. The final two dates of the first leg of the tour were in Minneapolis-St. Paul, where former Revolution drummer Bobby Z. sat in as guest drummer on both shows. In May, Prince announced a deal with Kobalt Music to market and distribute his music. On August 14, 2013, Prince released a new solo single for download through the 3rdeyegirl.com website. The single &quot;Breakfast Can Wait&quot; had cover art featuring comedian Dave Chappelle&#x27;s impersonation of him, from a 2004 second-season &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; comedy sketch on Comedy Central.

In February 2014, he performed concerts with 3rdeyegirl in London titled the Hit and Run Tour. Beginning with intimate shows, the first was held at the London home of singer Lianne La Havas, followed by two performances of what Prince described as a &quot;sound check&quot; at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, and another at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. On April 18, 2014, Prince released a new single entitled &quot;The Breakdown&quot;. He re-signed with his former label, Warner Bros. Records after an 18-year split. Warner announced that Prince would release a remastered deluxe edition of &quot;Purple Rain&quot; in 2014 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album. In return, Warner gave Prince ownership of the master recordings of his recordings with the company.

In February 2014, Prince began what was billed as his &quot;Hit N Run Part One&quot; tour. This involved Prince&#x27;s Twitter followers keeping an avid eye on second-by-second information as to the whereabouts of his shows. Many of these shows would only be announced on the day of the concert, and many of these concerts involved two performances: a and an evening show. These shows began at Camden&#x27;s Electric Ballroom, billed as &quot;Soundchecks&quot;, and spread throughout the UK capital to KoKo Club, in Camden, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire and various other small venues. After his London dates, he moved on to other European cities. In May 2014, Prince began his &quot;Hit N Run Part Two&quot; shows, which followed a more normal style of purchasing tickets online and being held in music arenas. In Spring 2014, he launched NPG Publishing, a music company to administer his own music and that of other artists without the restrictions of mainstream record companies.

In May 2015, following the killing of Freddie Gray in police custody and the subsequent riots, Prince released a song, &quot;Baltimore&quot;, in tribute to Gray and in support of the protesters in that city. He also held a tribute concert for Gray at his Paisley Park estate called &quot;Dance Rally 4 Peace&quot; in which he encouraged fans to wear the color gray in honor of Freddie Gray. On May 10, he performed a special concert at the Royal Farms Arena in Baltimore called &quot;Rally 4 Peace&quot;, which featured a special appearance by Baltimore State&#x27;s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, and one set performed by Prince alone at a keyboard.

Prince&#x27;s penultimate album, &quot;Hit n Run Phase One&quot;, was first made available on September 7, 2015, on the music streaming service Tidal before being released on CD and for download on September 14. His final album, &quot;Hit n Run Phase Two&quot;, was meant as a continuation of this, and was released on Tidal for streaming and download on December 12, 2015. In February 2016, Prince embarked on the Piano &amp; A Microphone Tour, a tour that saw his show stripped back to only him and a custom piano on stage. He performed a series of warm-up shows at Paisley Park in late January 2016 and the tour commenced in Melbourne, Australia, on February 16, 2016, to critical acclaim. The Australian and New Zealand legs of the tour were played in small-capacity venues, including the Sydney Opera House. &quot;Hit n Run Phase Two&quot; CDs were distributed to every attendee after each performance. The tour continued to the United States but was abruptly cut short by illness in April 2016.

== Illness and death ==

Prince saw Michael T. Schulenberg, a Twin Cities specialist in family medicine, in Excelsior on April 7, 2016, and again on April 20. On April 7, he postponed two performances at the Fox Theatre from his Piano &amp; a Microphone Tour; the venue released a statement saying he had influenza. He rescheduled and performed what was to be his final show on April 14, despite still not feeling well. While flying back to the Twin Cities early the next morning, he became unresponsive, and his private jet made an emergency landing at Quad Cities International Airport in Moline, Illinois, where he was hospitalized and received naloxone, a medication used to block the effects of opioids, especially following an overdose. Once he became conscious, he left against medical advice. Representatives said he was dehydrated and had influenza for several weeks. Prince was seen cycling the next day in his hometown of Chanhassen. He shopped that evening at the Electric Fetus in Minneapolis for Record Store Day and made a brief appearance at an impromptu dance party at his Paisley Park recording studio complex, stating that he was feeling fine. On April 19, he attended a performance by singer Lizz Wright at the Dakota Jazz Club.

On April 20, 2016, Prince&#x27;s representatives called Howard Kornfeld, a California specialist in addiction medicine and pain management, seeking medical help for the star. Kornfeld scheduled to meet with him on April 22, and he contacted a local physician who cleared his schedule for an exam on April 21. On April 21, at 9:43 am, the Carver County Sheriff&#x27;s Office received a 911 call requesting an ambulance be sent to Prince&#x27;s home at Paisley Park. The caller initially told the dispatcher that an unidentified person at the home was unconscious, then moments later said he was dead, and finally identified the person as Prince. The caller was Kornfeld&#x27;s son, who had flown in with buprenorphine that morning to devise a treatment plan for opioid addiction. Emergency responders found Prince unresponsive in an elevator and performed CPR, but a paramedic said he had already been dead for at least six hours, and they were unable to revive him. They pronounced him dead at 10:07 am, 19 minutes after their arrival. There were no signs of suicide or foul play. A press release from the Midwest Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office in Anoka County on June 2 stated that Prince had died of an accidental overdose of fentanyl, at the age of 57.

The fentanyl that led to his overdose was in counterfeit pills made to look like a generic version of the painkiller hydrocodone/paracetamol. The question of how and from what source Prince obtained the drug was the subject of investigations by several law enforcement agencies. A sealed search warrant was issued for his estate, and another unsealed search warrant was issued for the local Walgreens pharmacy. On April 19, 2018, the Carver County Attorney announced that the multi-agency investigation had ended with no criminal charges filed. The investigation did reveal that Prince was addicted to opioids.

Following an autopsy performed by A. Quinn Strobl, Prince&#x27;s remains were cremated. On April 26, 2016, Prince&#x27;s sister Tyka Nelson filed court documents in Carver County, to open a probate case, stating that no will had been found. As of his death, the twice-divorced Prince was neither married nor known to have fathered any surviving children. Under Minnesota law, the absence of a will meant that, in addition to his full sister, Prince&#x27;s five half-siblings also had a claim to an estate totaling millions of dollars in cash as well as real estate, stocks, and cars. Within three weeks of his death, 700 people claimed to be half-siblings or descendants. Bremer Trust was given temporary control of his estate, had his vault drilled open, and was authorized to obtain a blood sample for DNA profiling from the coroner who had performed the autopsy.

Prince&#x27;s ashes were placed into a custom 3D-printed urn shaped like the Paisley Park estate. The urn, which was co-designed by his sister Tyka and her son President, was placed on display in the atrium of the Paisley Park complex in October 2016. , no additional estate claimants were recognized by the courts besides Prince&#x27;s full sister and five half-siblings. It was reported in August 2022 that the Prince estate had settled. Filings in the Minnesota First Judicial District ordered that the cash in Prince&#x27;s estate be split evenly between Prince Legacy LLC and Prince OAT Holdings LLC.

=== Remembrances and reactions ===
Numerous musicians and cultural figures reacted to Prince&#x27;s death. President Obama mourned him, and the United States Senate passed a resolution praising his achievements &quot;as a musician, composer, innovator, and cultural icon&quot;. Cities across the U.S. held tributes and vigils, and lit buildings, bridges, and other structures in purple. In the first five hours after the media reported his death, &quot;Prince&quot; was the top trending (most-used) term on Twitter, and Facebook had 61 million Prince-related interactions. MTV interrupted its programming to air a marathon of Prince music videos and &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. AMC Theatres and Carmike Cinemas screened &quot;Purple Rain&quot; in select theaters over the following week. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired an episode in his honor, titled &quot;Goodnight, Sweet Prince&quot;, featuring his performances from the show.

Nielsen Music reported that sales of his material spiked 42,000 percent. The artist&#x27;s catalog sold 4.41 million albums and songs from April 21 to 28, with five albums simultaneously in the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, a first in the chart&#x27;s history. At the 59th Grammy Awards, Morris Day with the Time and Bruno Mars performed a tribute.

The May 2, 2016, cover of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; featured an illustration of purple rain. In June 2016 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;/Condé Nast, released a special edition commemorative magazine, &quot;The Genius of Prince&quot;. It celebrated the star&#x27;s life and achievements, with new photography and archive articles, including the original &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article from November 1984, written in the wake of the singer-songwriter&#x27;s breakout success, with other content from the magazine, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot;, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. The cover of &quot;The Genius of Prince&quot; featured a portrait by Andy Warhol, &quot;Orange Prince&quot; (1984). Casts of the musicals &quot;The Color Purple&quot; and &quot;Hamilton&quot; paid tribute to the star during their curtain calls with &quot;Purple Rain&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;, respectively.

In 2016, Minnesota representative Joe Atkins introduced a bill in the state legislature to memorialize Prince with a statue in the National Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol, in recognition of his contributions to music and the state of Minnesota. As of 2020, however, the bill has not had a second reading.

On August 21, 2016, Prince was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame.

The first posthumous release from the Estate was &quot;4Ever&quot; on November 22, 2016. It was a compilation of Prince&#x27;s hits plus one previously unreleased song, &quot;Moonbeam Levels&quot;, originally recorded for the &quot;1999&quot; sessions in 1982.

On February 9, 2017, Prince&#x27;s estate signed a distribution deal with Universal Music Group, which includes the post-1995 recordings on his NPG Records label and unreleased tracks from his vault. On June 27, Comerica (acting on behalf of the estate) requested that Carver County District Judge Kevin Eide cancel the estate&#x27;s deal with Universal, as UMG&#x27;s contract would interfere with a contract with Warner Music Group that Prince signed in 2014. After Universal&#x27;s attorneys were granted access to the Warner contract, the attorneys also offered to cancel the deal. On July 13, the court voided Universal&#x27;s deal with Prince&#x27;s estate, though Universal will continue to administer Prince&#x27;s songwriting credits and create merchandise.

On April 19, an EP featuring six unreleased Prince recordings, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, was announced with an expected release date for later that week. The next day, Prince&#x27;s estate was granted a temporary restraining order against George Ian Boxill, an engineer who co-produced the tracks and was in possession of the master tapes, and halted the release of the EP.

On June 23, a deluxe reissue of &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was released. The most expansive edition contained the first being a remaster of the original album made in 2015 and overseen by Prince himself, a bonus disc of previously unheard material called &quot;From the Vault &amp; Previously Unreleased&quot; plus single and maxi-single edits, B-sides and the first DVD issue of &quot;Prince and the Revolution: Live&quot; recorded in Syracuse on the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; Tour. The album debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Albums and Vinyl Albums charts.

In April 2018, the previously unreleased original recording of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot; from 1984 was released as a single. A music video was also released consisting of edited rehearsal footage shot in the summer of 1984. Troy Carter, adviser for Prince&#x27;s estate, later announced in an interview with &quot;Variety&quot; that a full-length album was planned for release on September 28.

In June of that year, the Prince estate signed a distribution deal with Sony Music Entertainment including the rights to all of Prince&#x27;s studio albums, plus unreleased music, remixes, live recordings, music videos and B-sides. From 2021 onwards, Prince&#x27;s Warner Bros. albums from 1978–1996 are distributed by Sony/Legacy Recordings in the United States, with Warner Music Group still controlling the international rights.

On August 17, all 23 post-Warner Bros. albums by Prince were released digitally on streaming platforms, together with a new compilation album entitled &quot;&quot;. Only one song remained unavailable to stream, &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot;, due to a plagiarism lawsuit in Italy that was not resolved until 2022. On September 21, &quot;Piano and a Microphone 1983&quot; was released, an intimate recording of Prince privately rehearsing with a piano.

The Sony/Legacy reissues began in 2019. Throughout that year, &quot;Musicology&quot;, &quot;3121&quot;, &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot;, &quot;Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic&quot;, &quot;Chaos and Disorder&quot; and &quot;Emancipation&quot; were reissued on CD and vinyl. &quot;Ultimate Rave&quot; was also released, a 2 CD and 1 DVD set which included the concert film of &quot;Rave Un2 the Year 2000&quot;. &quot;The Versace Experience - Prelude 2 Gold&quot; was also reissued for Record Store Day.

In June, a compilation of Prince&#x27;s original recordings of songs given to other artists, entitled &quot;Originals&quot;, was released - initially exclusively through TIDAL, then later on CD and vinyl. In October, a single of Prince&#x27;s previously unheard original acoustic demo of &quot;I Feel for You&quot; was released digitally and as a limited 7&quot; single.

In October 2019, Prince&#x27;s incomplete memoir &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; was published by Random House. Prince had worked on the memoir project with during the &quot;Piano and a Microphone&quot; Tour in 2016 and had managed to complete around 50 pages before his death. The book includes those pages plus a lengthy account by Piepenbring of how the project came to be, a scrapbook of rare personal photos and miscellanea from the vault, and Prince&#x27;s original handwritten concept for the film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;.

In November, a Deluxe reissue of &quot;1999&quot; was released. This reissue had several configurations, the most expansive including 35 previously unreleased songs and two live concerts.

=== 2020–present ===
In 2020, a Super Deluxe reissue of &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; was released. This reissue had various configurations, with the most expansive containing the original album, the single and maxi-single mixes, related B-sides, plus 45 previously unissued studio tracks, a live show from the &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times Tour&quot; in Utrecht plus a DVD featuring the New Year&#x27;s Eve 1987 show at Paisley Park. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; rated the Super Deluxe version 10 out of 10 and named it Best New Reissue.

In June 2021, &quot;The Truth&quot; was reissued on vinyl for Record Store Day. The following month saw the release of &quot;Welcome 2 America&quot;, a completely unheard album originally recorded and shelved in 2010.

In 2022, &quot;Prince and the Revolution: Live&quot; was reissued on Blu-Ray, along with the soundtrack which was also released on CD and vinyl for the first time. This year also saw the release of &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; on streaming services. It had previously been unavailable due to a plagiarism lawsuit in Italy which the estate has now resolved; Bruno Bergonzi and Michele Vicino are now legally recognized as co-writers in Italy.

In 2023, a Super Deluxe reissue of &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; was released, containing the original album plus remixes and B-sides from this era, 33 previously unheard tracks and a Blu-ray of a live concert recorded at Glam Slam in Minneapolis as a rehearsal for the 1992 &quot;Diamonds and Pearls Tour&quot;.

As of 2024, a nine-hour documentary on Prince was produced by Ezra Edelman for release on Netflix. The estate were reportedly unhappy with the project, considering it a &quot;sensationalized&quot; depiction of his life. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that it contained at least one instance of a former girlfriend accusing him of abuse. In February 2025, the project was officially cancelled and it was announced a new documentary will be produced by the estate instead. The Prince estate&#x27;s social media accounts then posted a video of a vault door being opened with the caption &quot;The vault is free.&quot;

== Artistry and legacy ==
=== Music and image ===
Prince is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Prince at No. 27 on its list of 100 Greatest Artists, &quot;the most influential artists of the rock &amp; roll era&quot;. In 2010, Prince was ranked number 7 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Prince at No. 16 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included &quot;Purple Rain&quot; at number 72, &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; at number 93, &quot;1999&quot; at number 163, and &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; at number 204. In 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; at number 52, &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; at number 108, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; at number 143, &quot;1999&quot; at number 212, &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; at number 299, and &quot;Kiss&quot; at number 461.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Prince &quot;our first post-everything pop star, defying easy categories of race, genre and commercial appeal&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;a master architect of funk, rock, R&amp;B and pop&quot;, and highlighted his ability to defy labels, while Geoffrey Himes described him as a leading artist in &quot;a tradition of left-wing black music&quot;, or &quot;progressive soul&quot;, although even he conceded the term may be &quot;too narrow&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Randall Roberts called Prince &quot;among the most versatile and restlessly experimental pop artists of our time,&quot; writing that his &quot;early work connected disco and synthetic funk [while his] fruitful mid-period merged rock, soul, R&amp;B and synth-pop.&quot; Simon Reynolds called him a &quot;pop polymath, flitting between , acid rock, deep soul, —often within the same song&quot;. AllMusic wrote that, &quot;With each album he released, Prince showed remarkable stylistic growth and musical diversity, constantly experimenting with different sounds, textures, and genres [...] no other contemporary artist blended so many diverse styles into a cohesive whole.&quot; Jon Pareles has named Prince among the &quot;pantheon&quot; of artists in the album era, in which the album format was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption.

As a performer, he was known for his flamboyant style and showmanship. He came to be regarded as a sex symbol for his androgynous, amorphous sexuality, play with signifiers of gender, and defiance of racial stereotypes. His &quot;audacious, idiosyncratic&quot; fashion sense made use of &quot;ubiquitous purple, alluring makeup and frilled garments&quot;. His androgynous look has been compared to those of Little Richard and David Bowie. In 2016, Reynolds described it as &quot;Prince&#x27;s &#x27;80s evasion of conventional gender definitions speaks to us now in this trans-aware moment. But it also harks backwards in time to the origins of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in racial mixture and sexual blurring&quot;. Prince was known for the strong female presence in his bands and his support for women in the music industry throughout his career. &quot;Slate&quot; said he worked with an &quot;astounding range of female stars&quot; and &quot;promised a world where men and women looked and acted like each other&quot;. Prince also wore high-heeled shoes and boots both on and off-stage.

Many artists have cited Prince as an influence and inspiration, including Beyoncé, Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Usher, Janelle Monáe, the Weeknd, Lady Gaga, Lorde, Marilyn Manson, Lenny Kravitz, André 3000, Mark Speer, Jamie Lidell, Frank Ocean, Miguel, Mya, Robyn, D&#x27;Angelo, H.E.R., Ciara, The-Dream, St. Vincent, Ween, and Beck. Bono of U2 regarded Prince as one of his &quot;favorite composers of the twentieth century&quot;. Beyoncé expressed her admiration for Prince in the book &quot;Prince: A Private View&quot;, calling him &quot;my mentor&quot; and also praising his independence: &quot;He dared to fight for what was rightfully his: his freedom, wrapped up in words and music he created.&quot;

In August 2017, Pantone Inc. introduced a new shade of purple () in their color system in honor of Prince. The shade is called &quot;Love Symbol #2&quot;.

=== Influences and musicianship ===
Prince&#x27;s music synthesized a wide variety of influences, and drew inspiration from a range of musicians, including Ike Turner, James Brown, George Clinton, Joni Mitchell, Duke Ellington, Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Chuck Berry, David Bowie, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Mick Jagger, Rick James, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Curtis Mayfield, Elvis Presley, Todd Rundgren, Carlos Santana, Sly Stone, Jackie Wilson, and Stevie Wonder.

Prince has been compared with jazz artist Miles Davis in regard to the artistic changes throughout his career. Davis said he regarded Prince as an otherworldly blend of James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, Marvin Gaye, Sly Stone, Little Richard, Duke Ellington, and Charlie Chaplin. Prince and Miles Davis performed together in December 1987 for a Charity Event at Paisley Park. This performance was viewed as the pinnacle of their on-again, off-again partnership.

Journalist Nik Cohn described him as &quot;rock&#x27;s greatest ever natural talent&quot;. Prince was a natural tenor, but he had a wide vocal range from falsetto to baritone, and performed rapid, seemingly effortless shifts of register. Prince was also renowned as a multi-instrumentalist. He is considered a guitar virtuoso and a master of drums, percussion, bass, keyboards, and synthesizer. On his first five albums, he played nearly all the instruments, including 27 instruments on his debut album, among them various types of bass, keyboards and synthesizers. Prince was also quick to embrace technology in his music, making pioneering use of drum machines like the Linn LM-1 on his early &#x27;80s albums and employing a wide range of studio effects. The &quot;LA Times&quot; also noted his &quot;harnessing [of] new-generation synthesizer sounds in service of the groove,&quot; laying the foundations for post-&#x27;70s funk music. Prince was also known for his prolific and virtuosic tendencies, which resulted in him recording large amounts of unreleased material.

Prince also wrote songs for other artists, and some songs of his were covered by musicians, such as the hit songs &quot;Manic Monday&quot; (performed by the Bangles), &quot;I Feel for You&quot;, originally on Prince&#x27;s self-titled second album from 1979, covered by Chaka Khan, and &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, written for Prince&#x27;s side project the Family, and covered very successfully by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. Prince co-wrote &quot;Love... Thy Will Be Done&quot; with singer Martika, for her second album, &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, and also gifted Celine Dion a song for her second album, &quot;Celine Dion&quot;, titled &quot;With This Tear&quot;; it was a song Prince had written specifically for her. Prince also wrote &quot;U&quot; for Paula Abdul, appearing on her 1991 release &quot;Spellbound&quot;.
=== Equipment ===
A guitar virtuoso, Prince was also known to have a stylish and flamboyant custom guitar collection, which consisted of 121 guitars. One notable series is his Cloud Guitars, which were commissioned and released in colored versions of white, yellow and purple. The white version is prominently shown in the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; film and the &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot; video. Other notable guitars are The Love Symbol guitars, which were designed in the separate colors of gold and purple. The guitar that was used for the majority of Prince&#x27;s music career was the H.S. Anderson Madcat guitar – a Telecaster copy created by Hohner. Several versions of the guitar were used throughout his career – due to one being donated for charitable reasons, while one or more were stolen. Another guitar primarily used in his later years was the Vox HDC-77, which was introduced to him by 3rdeyegirl member Ida Kristine Nielsen, both a Blackburst version, and a White Ivory version. Two other noteworthy guitars are the G1 Purple Special, and the black-and-gold Gus G3 Prince bass, which would become the last two guitars to ever be made for him.

== Legal issues ==
=== Pseudonyms ===
In 1993, during negotiations regarding the release of &quot;The Gold Experience&quot;, a legal battle ensued between Warner Bros. and Prince over the artistic and financial control of his musical output. During the lawsuit, Prince appeared in public with the word &quot;slave&quot; written on his cheek. He explained that he had changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol to emancipate himself from his contract with Warner Bros., and that he had done it out of frustration because he felt his own name now belonged to the company.

Prince sometimes used pseudonyms to separate himself from the music he had written, produced or recorded, and at one point stated that his ownership and achievement were strengthened by the act of giving away ideas. Pseudonyms he adopted, at various times, include: &quot;Jamie Starr&quot; and &quot;The Starr Company&quot; (for the songs he wrote for the Time and many other artists from 1981 to 1984), &quot;Joey Coco&quot; (for many unreleased Prince songs in the late 1980s, as well as songs written for Sheena Easton and Kenny Rogers), &quot;Alexander Nevermind&quot; (for writing the song &quot;Sugar Walls&quot; (1984) by Sheena Easton), and &quot;Christopher&quot; (used for his songwriting credit of &quot;Manic Monday&quot; (1986) for the Bangles).

=== Copyright issues ===
On September 14, 2007, Prince announced that he was going to sue YouTube and eBay, because they hosted his copyrighted material, and he hired the international Internet-policing company Web Sheriff. In October, Stephanie Lenz filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Publishing Group claiming that they were abusing copyright law after the music publisher had YouTube take down Lenz&#x27;s home movie in which the Prince song &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot; played faintly in the background. On November 5, several Prince fan sites formed &quot;Prince Fans United&quot; to fight back against legal requests which, they claim, Prince made to prevent all use of photographs, images, lyrics, album covers, and anything linked to his likeness. Prince&#x27;s lawyers claimed that this constituted copyright infringement; Prince Fans United said that the legal actions were &quot;attempts to stifle all critical commentary about Prince&quot;. Prince&#x27;s promoter AEG stated that the only offending items on the three fansites were live shots from Prince&#x27;s 21 nights in London at the O2 Arena earlier in the year.

On November 8, Prince Fans United received a song named &quot;PFUnk&quot;, providing a kind of &quot;unofficial answer&quot; to their movement. The song originally debuted on the PFU main site, was retitled &quot;F.U.N.K.&quot;, but this is not one of the selected songs available on the iTunes Store. On November 14, the satirical website b3ta.com pulled their &quot;image challenge of the week&quot; devoted to Prince after legal threats from the star under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

At the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (&quot;Coachella Festival&quot;), Prince performed a cover of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Creep&quot;; however, immediately afterward, he forced YouTube and other sites to remove footage that fans had taken of the performance despite Radiohead&#x27;s request to leave it on the website. Days later, YouTube reinstated the videos, as Radiohead had said: &quot;It&#x27;s our song, let people hear it.&quot; In 2009, Prince put the video of the Coachella performance on his official website.

In 2010, Prince declared: &quot;the internet is completely over&quot;, elaborating five years later that &quot;the internet was over for anyone who wants to get paid... tell me a musician who&#x27;s got rich off digital sales&quot;.

In 2013, the Electronic Frontier Foundation granted Prince the inaugural &quot;Raspberry Beret Lifetime Aggrievement Award&quot; for what they said was abuse of the DMCA takedown process.

In January 2014, Prince filed a lawsuit titled &quot;Prince v. Chodera&quot; against 22 online users for direct copyright infringement, unauthorized fixation, contributory copyright infringement, and bootlegging. Several of the users were fans who had shared links to bootlegged versions of Prince concerts through social media websites like Facebook. In the same month, he dismissed the entire action without prejudice.

Prince was one of a small handful of musicians to deny &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic requests to parody his music. (Yankovic does not always need legal permission to parody songs, but he requests artists&#x27; permission as a professional courtesy.) By Yankovic&#x27;s account, he&#x27;d done so &quot;about a half-dozen times&quot; and has been the sole artist not to give any explanation for his rejection beyond a flat &quot;no&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Prince had seven siblings, six of whom were half-siblings. As Prince had no will, the six siblings who survived him at the time of his death could inherit his estate. As of November 2024, only three of them, half sisters Sharon and Norraine Nelson and half brother Omar Bakker, are still living. However, only the two surviving half sisters still have shares in Prince&#x27;s estate.

His half sister Lorna died in 2006. Another half brother Alfred Jackson died in August 2019. On September 3, 2021, John R. Nelson, Prince&#x27;s eldest half brother, died. On November 4, 2024, musician Tyka Nelson, who was Prince&#x27;s only full sibling, died. In July 2021, Omar Bakker and late half brother Alfred Jackson&#x27;s interest would sell all of the shares they owned of Prince&#x27;s estate to Primary Wave Music, while Tyka Nelson would sell 90%.

===Relationships===
Prince was romantically linked with many women over the years, including Kim Basinger, Madonna, Vanity, Jill Jones, Sheila E., Carmen Electra, Susannah Melvoin, and Sherilyn Fenn. Susannah Melvoin recalled how, around the time of &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot;, &quot;Wendy [Melvoin, her twin sister] and Lisa [Coleman] and I lived together and we would have [Prince] stay at our place. We became really close. He got to be in a family of three women, and we got to have our Prince. Not many people had that kind of relationship with him.&quot;

In 1990, he saw 16-year-old dancer Mayte García standing outside his tour bus and referred to her as his &quot;future wife&quot; when pointing her out to bandmate Rosie Gaines. García began working as one of his backup singers and dancers after graduating from high school. They were married on February 14, 1996, when he was 37 and she was 22. According to García, she and Prince had a son named Amiir (born October 16, 1996), who died a week after being born due to Pfeiffer syndrome. Attempts by publications to independently verify the child&#x27;s name, birth, and cause of death proved difficult due to Prince&#x27;s focus on privacy. The distress of losing a child and García&#x27;s subsequent miscarriage took a toll on the marriage, and the couple divorced in 2000.

Prince married Manuela Testolini, a Canadian businesswoman of Italian and Egyptian descent, in a private ceremony in 2001; she hails from Toronto, which led the couple to live there part-time. They separated in 2005 and filed for divorce in May 2006, which was finalized in October 2007.

===Religious beliefs===
Prince was an observant religious person from childhood and throughout his life. An abiding love of God and Jesus were recurring themes in his work, often closely intertwined with romance, sexuality and sensuality on songs such as &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot; and albums such as &quot;Lovesexy&quot;. In March 2016, while discussing his childhood during a show in Oakland, he told the audience: 
A complete recitation of The Lord&#x27;s Prayer featured in the full-length album version of his 1981 hit &quot;Controversy.&quot; His 1984 track &quot;Darling Nikki&quot;, while dealing with explicit subject matter involving an encounter with a sex worker, contained the following backward message: &quot;Hello, how are you?/Fine, fine, ’cause I know that the Lord is coming soon/Coming, coming soon.&quot; That same year, he released a B-side simply entitled &quot;God.&quot;

Prince became a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness in 2001 as a result of his friendship with bassist Larry Graham. He did not consider it a conversion but a &quot;realization&quot;, comparing his connection with Graham to Morpheus and Neo in the film &quot;The Matrix&quot;. He attended meetings at a local Kingdom Hall and occasionally knocked on people&#x27;s doors to discuss his faith. His newfound faith would also heavily influence his 2001 album &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot;. The CD edition of his 2003 instrumental album &quot;N.E.W.S&quot; contained an Adobe Flash file that slowly display the words &quot;He Causes 2 Become&quot; when the disc was inserted into a computer, being a reference to the name of Jehovah in Witness theology.

Shortly after he became a Witness, former bandmates Melvoin and Coleman reached out to him for a potential reunion of their 1980s band the Revolution. Melvoin claims he declined due to her lesbian and Jewish identities, then asked her to hold a press conference in which she would disavow homosexuality and become a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness herself. She resigned herself to never hearing from him again. However, Prince later reunited with Melvoin in 2004 to perform a stripped-back acoustic version of the song &quot;Reflection&quot; on the Tavis Smiley Tonight Show and subsequently performed &quot;Purple Rain&quot; with her and Coleman at the Brit Awards 2006. Anti-gay marriage comments were attributed to him in 2008 but later denied by his management and walked back by him personally, as he later stated, &quot;I have friends who are gay, and we study the Bible together.&quot; Despite his ambiguous, contradictory and evolving personal convictions throughout his lifetime, Prince is often considered a queer icon by his fans for his influence on music, fashion and culture in a manner infused with religious themes.

García said of Prince&#x27;s religious beliefs: &quot;He was always a spiritual seeker ... fascinated in all possibilities to integrate the signs of the zodiac and third eye and reincarnation into the Christian beliefs his Baptist mother and Seventh-day Adventist father had exposed him to.&quot; At the time of his passing, Prince&#x27;s display picture on Twitter was an illustration of him with both eyes closed and a third eye on his forehead open.

===Political beliefs and activism===
Prince rarely expressed partisan political beliefs directly for the majority of his career. However, he did not shy away from political themes and commentary in early songs such as &quot;Partyup&quot;, &quot;Ronnie Talk to Russia&quot; (which directly addressed then-President Ronald Reagan), &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Sign O&#x27; the Times&quot; and later &quot;Money Don&#x27;t Matter 2 Night&quot;, in part a protest against the Gulf War. His 2002 song &quot;Avalanche&quot; contained the lyric &quot;Abraham Lincoln was a racist&quot; and discussed the Thirteenth Amendment. In 2004, the music video for his single &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; depicted a young Muslim woman facing Islamophobia and racial abuse and then detonating a suicide bomb in a crowded airport, before revealing it had all been a dream.

In a 2009 interview with Tavis Smiley, when asked for his opinion on the recent election of Barack Obama, Prince replied that he did not vote for him and has in fact never voted at all. He also expressed a belief in the chemtrail conspiracy theory during the same interview.

Towards the end of his life, Prince was a supporter of Black Lives Matter. According to Al Sharpton, he donated to the family of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and later arranged for Eric Garner&#x27;s family to attend one of his concerts. Before handing out the Grammy for Best Album in 2015, he told the audience, &quot;Albums — remember those? Albums still matter. Albums, like books and black lives, still matter.” He organized a &quot;Rally 4 Peace&quot; concert in the city of Baltimore in the aftermath of the killing of Freddie Gray. The following day, he released a single entitled &quot;Baltimore&quot; with lyrics that mentioned Gray and Michael Brown. The music video for &quot;Baltimore&quot; featured footage of Black Lives Matter protests in the city, and closed with a message from Prince:
===Animal rights===
Prince was an animal rights activist who followed a vegan diet for part of his life but later described himself as vegetarian. He previously adhered to a pescetarian diet in the 2000s and according to an interview with the &quot;Vegetarian Times&quot;, Prince first expressed curiosity in removing meat from his diet around 1987 when he ceased eating all red meat. Prince required Paisley Park guests and staff to maintain a vegetarian diet or pescetarian diet while present in order to keep the environment meatless. In honor of Prince&#x27;s personal ethos, Paisley Park continues to require that individuals leave the premises if they would like to eat meat. The liner notes for his album &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot; featured a message about the cruelty involved in wool production.

===Charitable endeavors===
Prince did not speak publicly about his charitable endeavors. The extent of his activism, philanthropy, and charity was only publicized after his death, and much of it remains undocumented.

In 2001, he anonymously donated $12,000 to the Louisville Free Public Library system to keep the historic Western Branch Library (the country&#x27;s first full-service library for African-Americans) from closure. That same year, he anonymously paid off the medical bills of drummer Clyde Stubblefield, who was undergoing cancer treatment.

In 2015, he conceived and launched YesWeCode, paying for many hackathons outright and performing musical acts at some of them. He also helped fund the Green for All initiative.

According to Australian musician Ed Le Brocq&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Danger Music&quot;, written about Le Brocq&#x27;s time as a music teacher in Afghanistan, Prince had &quot;quietly donated to PARSA (Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Services for Afghanistan) for years&quot; which had funded the revival of the Afghanistan Scout Association.

== Achievements ==


Prince sold at least 150 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2016, and Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2024. In 2016, he was posthumously honored with a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Minnesota. He was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022. Prince was named the 14th greatest guitarist of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2023.

He has won seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;), and a Golden Globe Award. Two of his albums, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; and &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot;, received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year nominations. &quot;1999&quot;, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; and &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; have all been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. At the 28th Grammy Awards, Prince was awarded the President&#x27;s Merit Award. Prince was also honored with the American Music Award for Achievement and American Music Award of Merit at the American Music Awards of 1990 and American Music Awards of 1995 respectively. At the 2013 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, he was honored with the &quot;Billboard&quot; Icon Award. In 2019, the 1984 film &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was added by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Prince has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis&quot;, according to journalist Steve Marsh. The Revolution also has a star on the mural, to the immediate right of Prince&#x27;s. Originally painted silver like the other stars on the mural, Prince&#x27;s star was repainted in gold leaf during the night of May 4, 2016, about two weeks after Prince&#x27;s death. Originally anonymous, the artist was revealed a few months later to be graphic designer and graffiti artist Peyton Russell, who had worked for Prince at his club Glam Slam in the 1990s and wanted to pay tribute.

<doc id="57321" wikidata="Q178095" url="?curid=57321" title="The Police">
<text>The Police were an English rock band formed in London in 1977. Within a few months of their first gig, the line-up settled as Sting (lead vocals, bass guitar, primary songwriter), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums, percussion), and this remained unchanged for the rest of the band&#x27;s history. The Police became globally popular from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. Emerging in the British new wave scene, they played a style of rock influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz.

Their 1978 debut album, &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot;, reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart and contains the singles &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; (1979), became the first of four consecutive No. 1 studio albums in the UK and Australia; its first two singles, &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot;, became their first UK number-one singles. Their next two albums, &quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot; (1980) and &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; (1981), led to further critical and commercial success, with two songs, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot;, becoming UK number-one singles and Top 5 hits in other countries. The former album was their breakthrough into the US, reaching number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Their final studio album, &quot;Synchronicity&quot; (1983), was No. 1 in the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy and the US, selling over 8 million copies in the US. Its lead single, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, became their fifth UK number one, and only US number one. During this time, the band were considered one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the US: in 1983 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; labelled them &quot;the first British New Wave act to break through in America on a grand scale, and possibly the biggest band in the world&quot;. However, at the height of their fame the Police disbanded in 1984, periodically reuniting for one-off performances before fully reuniting in early 2007 for a world tour ending in August 2008. They were the world&#x27;s highest-earning musicians in 2008 due to their reunion tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2007.

The Police have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The band won a number of music awards, including six Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards (winning Best British Group once), and an MTV Video Music Award. In 2003, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of their five studio albums appeared on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. The band were included among both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s and VH1&#x27;s lists of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.

==History==
===1977: formation===
On 25 September 1976, while on tour with the British progressive rock band Curved Air in Newcastle upon Tyne, in the northeast of England, the band&#x27;s American drummer, Stewart Copeland, met and exchanged phone numbers with singer-bassist Gordon Sumner, a.k.a. Sting, who at the time was playing in a jazz-rock fusion band called Last Exit. On 12 January 1977, Sting moved to London, and on the day of his arrival, sought out Copeland for a jam session.

Curved Air had recently split up and Copeland, inspired by the contemporary punk rock movement, was eager to form a new band to join the burgeoning London punk scene. While less keen, Sting acknowledged the commercial opportunities, so they formed the Police as a trio, with Corsican guitarist Henry Padovani recruited as the third member. After their debut concert on 1 March 1977 at the Alexandria Club in Newport, Wales (which lasted only ten minutes), the group played London pubs and punk clubs touring as backing band and support act for Cherry Vanilla and for Wayne County &amp; the Electric Chairs. On 1 May 1977, the Police released on Illegal Records their debut single &quot;Fall Out&quot;, recorded at Pathway Studios in Islington, North London on 12 February 1977 (a couple of weeks before the band&#x27;s debut live performance), with a budget of £150. This is the only Police recording featuring Padovani. Mick Jagger reviewed the single in &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine.

Also in May 1977, former Gong musician Mike Howlett invited Sting to join him in the band project Strontium 90. The drummer Howlett had in mind, Chris Cutler, was unavailable, so Sting took Copeland. The band&#x27;s fourth member was guitarist Andy Summers. A decade older than Sting and Copeland, Summers was a music industry veteran who had played with Eric Burdon and the Animals and Kevin Ayers among others. Strontium 90 performed at a Gong reunion concert in Paris on 28 May 1977, and played at a London club (under the name of &quot;the Elevators&quot;) in July. The band also recorded several demo tracks: these were released (along with live recordings and an early version of &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot;) 20 years later on the archive album &quot;Strontium 90: Police Academy&quot;.
Summers impressed Sting, who was becoming frustrated with Padovani&#x27;s rudimentary abilities and the limitations they imposed on the Police&#x27;s potential. Shortly after the Strontium 90 gig, Sting approached Summers to join the band. He agreed, on condition the band remain a trio, with him replacing Padovani. Restrained by loyalty, Copeland and Sting resisted the idea, and the Police carried on as a four-piece band. They performed live twice: on 25 July 1977 at the Music Machine in London and on 5 August at the Mont de Marsan Punk Festival. Shortly after these two gigs (and an aborted recording session with ex-Velvet Underground member John Cale as producer on 10 August), Summers delivered an ultimatum to the band and Padovani was dismissed. Copeland later said: &quot;One by one, Sting&#x27;s songs had started coming in, and when Andy joined, it opened up new numbers of Sting&#x27;s we could do, so the material started to get a lot more interesting and Sting started to take a lot more interest in the group.&quot;
The Police&#x27;s power trio line-up of Copeland, Sting, and Summers performed for the first time on 18 August 1977 at Rebecca&#x27;s club in Birmingham in the West Midlands. This line-up endured for the rest of the band&#x27;s history. Few punk bands were three-pieces, while contemporary bands pursuing progressive rock, symphonic rock and other sound trends usually expanded their line-ups with support players. The musical background of all three players may have made them suspect to punk purists, with music critic Christopher Gable stating,

The band also drew on influences from reggae to jazz to progressive and pub rock. While maintaining the main band, Police members continued to moonlight within the art rock scene. In late 1977 and early 1978, Sting and Summers recorded and performed as part of an ensemble led by German experimental composer Eberhard Schoener; Copeland also joined for a time. These performances resulted in three albums, a mix of rock, electronica and jazz. Various appearances by the Schoener outfit on German television made the German public aware of Sting&#x27;s unusual high-pitched voice, and helped pave the way for the Police&#x27;s later popularity.

The bleached-blond hair that became a band trademark happened by accident. In February 1978, the band, desperate for money, were asked to do a commercial for Wrigley&#x27;s Spearmint chewing gum (directed by Tony Scott) on the condition they dye their hair blond in order to play a punk band (blond being associated with punk at the time). The commercial was shot with the band—Summers states, &quot;There’s a shot of us carrying a 6-foot-long packet of Wrigley’s across the room&quot;—but was never aired.

===1977–1978: recording contract and &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; ===
Copeland&#x27;s older brother Miles was initially sceptical of the inclusion of Summers in the band, fearing it would undermine their punk credibility, and reluctantly agreed to provide £1,500 to finance the Police&#x27;s first album. &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; was made with no manager or record deal. It was recorded during off-peak hours at the Surrey Sound Studios in Leatherhead, Surrey, a converted recording facility above a dairy which was run by brothers Chris and Nigel Gray.

During one of his studio visits, Miles heard &quot;Roxanne&quot; for the first time at the end of a session. He had been less enthusiastic about the band&#x27;s other songs, but the elder Copeland was struck by the track, and got the Police a record deal with A&amp;M Records on the strength of it. &quot;Roxanne&quot; was issued as a single in early 1978, while other album tracks were still being recorded, but failed to chart. It also failed to make the BBC&#x27;s playlist, which the band attributed to the song&#x27;s depiction of prostitution. A&amp;M consequently promoted the single with posters claiming &quot;Banned by the BBC&quot;, though it was never banned, just not play-listed. Copeland later said, &quot;We got a lot of mileage out of it being supposedly banned by the BBC.&quot;
The Police made their first television appearance in October 1978, on BBC2&#x27;s &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; to promote the release of &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot;. The BBC banned the second single from &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot; due to the single&#x27;s cover, which featured Copeland hanging himself over an ice block being melted by a portable radiator. The single became the Police&#x27;s first chart hit, peaking at No. 42 in the UK. The follow-up single, &quot;So Lonely&quot;, issued in November 1978, failed to chart. In February 1979, &quot;Roxanne&quot; was issued as a single in North America, where it was played on radio despite the subject matter. The song peaked at No. 31 in Canada and No. 32 in the US, spurring a UK re-release of it in April. The band performed &quot;Roxanne&quot; on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and the re-issue of the song peaked at No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart.

The group&#x27;s UK success led to gigs in the US at the famous New York City club CBGB, The Rathskeller in Boston and at The Chance in Poughkeepsie, New York, from which &quot;Roxanne&quot; debuted on US radio on WPDH, and a gruelling 1979 North American tour in which the band drove themselves and their equipment around the country in a Ford Econoline van. That year, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot; was also re-released in the UK, peaking at No. 2. The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Fall Out&quot;, was reissued in late 1979, peaking at No. 47 in the UK.

===1979: &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot;===

In October 1979, the group released their second album, &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot;, which topped the UK Albums Chart and became the first of four consecutive UK No. 1 studio albums. The album spawned the hit singles &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; (No. 1 UK, No. 2 Canada, No. 5 Australia) and &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot; (No. 1 UK). The album&#x27;s singles failed to enter the US top 40, but &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; reached No. 25 on the US album charts.

The band&#x27;s first live performance of &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; was on the BBC&#x27;s television show &quot;Rock Goes to College&quot; filmed at Hatfield Polytechnic College in Hertfordshire. The instrumental title track &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In February 1980, the single &quot;So Lonely&quot; was reissued in the UK, peaking at No. 6.

In March 1980, the Police began their first world tour, including Mexico, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Greece and Egypt. The tour was subsequently documented in the film &quot;The Police Around the World&quot; (1982), directed by Kate and Derek Burbidge, which contains footage shot by Annie Nightingale originally intended for a BBC production &quot;The Police in the East&quot;.

In May 1980, A&amp;M in the UK released &quot;Six Pack&quot;, a package containing the five A&amp;M singles (not including &quot;Fall Out&quot;) in their original sleeves plus a mono alternate take of the album track &quot;The Bed&#x27;s Too Big Without You&quot; backed with a live version of &quot;Truth Hits Everybody&quot;. It reached No. 17 in the UK Singles Chart (although chart regulations introduced later in the decade would have classed it as an album).

===1980–1981: &quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot;===
Pressured by their record company for a new record and a prompt return to touring, the Police released their third album, &quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot;, on 3 October 1980. The album was recorded in a three-week period in the Netherlands for tax reasons and was completed the night before the band embarked on a new world tour. The album topped the UK Albums Chart and reached number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also gave the group their third UK No. 1 hit single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me&quot; (the UK&#x27;s best-selling single of 1980) and another hit single, &quot;De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da&quot;, both of which reached No. 10 in the US.

While the three band members and co-producer Nigel Gray all expressed immediate regret over the rushed recording for the album, which was finished at 4 a.m. on the day the band began their world tour, the album received praise from critics. The instrumental &quot;Behind My Camel&quot;, written by Andy Summers, won the band a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, while &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me&quot; won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance for Duo or Group.

===1981–1982: &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; and &quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot; ===
The Police&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;, co-produced by Hugh Padgham, was recorded at AIR Studios on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, with the exception of &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot; which was recorded at Le Studio at Morin Heights, Quebec, Canada, and released in 1981. It featured thicker sounds, layered saxophones, and vocal textures. It spawned the hit singles &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot; (featuring pianist Jean Roussel), their fourth UK No. 1 (No. 3 in the US), &quot;Invisible Sun&quot;, and &quot;Spirits in the Material World&quot;. As the band was unable to agree on a cover picture, the album cover had three red pictographs, digital likenesses of the three band members in the style of segmented LED displays, set against a black background. In the 1980s, Sting and Summers became tax exiles and moved to Ireland (Sting to Roundstone, County Galway, and Summers to Kinsale in County Cork) while Copeland remained in England. The group opened and closed the 1981 concert film, &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot;. The film, which captured the music scene in the wake of punk, was masterminded by Stewart Copeland&#x27;s brothers Ian and Miles. The film had a limited release but developed a mythic reputation over the years.

At the 1982 Brit Awards in London, the Police received the award for Best British Group. After the Ghost in the Machine Tour concluded in 1982, the group took a sabbatical and each member pursued outside projects. By this time, Sting was becoming a major star, and he established a career beyond the Police by branching out into acting. Back in 1979, he had made a well-received debut as the &quot;Ace Face&quot; in the British drama film &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, a film loosely based on The Who&#x27;s rock opera, followed by a role as a mechanic in love with Eddie Cochran&#x27;s music in Chris Petit&#x27;s &quot;Radio On&quot;. In 1982, Sting furthered his acting career by co-starring in the Richard Loncraine film &quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot;. He also had a minor solo hit in the United Kingdom with the movie&#x27;s theme song, a cover of the 1929 hit &quot;Spread a Little Happiness&quot; (which appeared on the &quot;Brimstone &amp; Treacle&quot; soundtrack, along with three new Police tracks, &quot;How Stupid Mr Bates&quot;, &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot;, and &quot;I Burn for You&quot;). Over 1981 and 1982, Summers recorded his first album with Robert Fripp, &quot;I Advance Masked&quot;.

In 1983, Stewart Copeland composed the musical score for Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s film &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;. The single &quot;Don&#x27;t Box Me In (theme From &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;)&quot;, a collaboration between Copeland and singer-songwriter Stan Ridgway (of the band Wall of Voodoo) received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. Sting filmed his first big-budget movie role in 1983, playing Feyd-Rautha in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;. As Sting&#x27;s fame rose, his relationship with Copeland deteriorated. Their increasingly strained partnership was further stretched by the pressures of worldwide publicity and fame, conflicting egos, and their financial success. Meanwhile, both Sting&#x27;s and Summers&#x27;s marriages failed.

===1983: &quot;The Biggest Band in the World&quot;===

In 1983, the Police released their last studio album, &quot;Synchronicity&quot;, which spawned the hit singles &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot;, &quot;King of Pain&quot;, and &quot;Synchronicity II&quot;. By that time, several critics deemed them &quot;the biggest rock band in the world&quot;. Recording the album was a tense affair with increasing disputes among the band. The three members recorded their contributions individually in separate rooms and over-dubbed at different times.

The Synchronicity Tour began in Chicago, Illinois in July 1983 at the original Comiskey Park, and on 18 August the band played in front of 70,000 in Shea Stadium, New York. Near the end of the concert, Sting announced: &quot;We&#x27;d like to thank the Beatles for lending us their stadium.&quot; Looking back, Copeland states, &quot;Playing Shea Stadium was big because, even though I&#x27;m a septic tank &quot;(rhyming slang for &#x27;Yank&#x27;)&quot;, The Police is an English band and I&#x27;m a Londoner – an American Londoner – so it felt like conquering America.&quot; They played throughout the UK in December 1983, including four sold-out nights at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena, and the tour ended in Melbourne, Australia on 4 March 1984 at the Melbourne Showgrounds (the final concert featured Sunnyboys, Kids in the Kitchen, Bryan Adams and Australian Crawl, with the Police topping the bill). Sting&#x27;s look, dominated by his orange hair (a result of his role in &quot;Dune&quot;) and tattered clothing, both of which were emphasised in the music videos from the album, carried over into the set for the concert. Except for &quot;King of Pain&quot;, the singles were accompanied by music videos directed by Godley &amp; Creme.

&quot;Synchronicity&quot; became a No. 1 album in both the UK (where it debuted at No. 1) and the US. It stayed at No. 1 in the UK for two weeks and in the US for seventeen weeks. It was nominated for Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, but lost to Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; won the Grammy for Song of the Year, beating Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; also won the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, while the album won the Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; also won the American Video Award for Best Group video, and the song won two Ivor Novello Awards in the categories Best Song Musically and Lyrically and Most Performed Work from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.

===1984–1986: hiatus, aborted sixth studio album===
During the group&#x27;s 1983 Shea Stadium concert, Sting felt performing at the venue was &quot;Everest&quot; and decided to pursue a solo career, according to the documentary &quot;The Last Play at Shea&quot;. After the Synchronicity tour ended in March 1984, the band went on hiatus while Sting recorded and toured in support of his successful solo debut LP, the jazz-influenced &quot;The Dream of the Blue Turtles&quot;, released in June 1985; Copeland recorded and filmed &quot;The Rhythmatist&quot; (1985); and Summers recorded another album with Robert Fripp (&quot;Bewitched&quot;, 1984) and the theme song for the film &quot;2010&quot;—which was not used in the film, but included on the soundtrack album. At the 1985 Brit Awards held at London&#x27;s Grosvenor Hotel on 11 February, the band received the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In July, Sting and Copeland participated in Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London.

In June 1986, the Police reconvened to play three concerts for the Amnesty International A Conspiracy of Hope tour. Their last performance on stage before their split was on 15 June at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. They ended their set with &quot;Invisible Sun&quot;, bringing out Bono to sing the final verse. When they finished, they handed U2 their instruments for the all-star finale of &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;. As the lead singer of U2 – who would soon be regarded as the biggest band in the world – Bono stated, &quot;It was a very big moment, like passing a torch.&quot;

In July, the trio reunited in the studio to record a new album, but Copeland broke his collarbone in a fall from a horse and was unable to play the drums. As a result of the tense and short-lived reunion in the studio, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me &#x27;86&quot; was released in October 1986 as their final single and made it into the UK Top 25. It also appeared on the 1986 compilation &quot;Every Breath You Take: The Singles&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. A rerecorded version of &quot;De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da&quot; was subsequently also included on the DTS-CD release of the &quot;Every Breath You Take: The Classics&quot; album in 1995. The album has sold over five million copies in the US.

Following the failed effort to record a new studio album, the Police effectively disbanded. In the liner notes to the Police&#x27;s box set &quot;Message in a Box&quot;, Summers explains: &quot;The attempt to record a new album was doomed from the outset. The night before we went into the studio Stewart broke his collarbone falling off a horse and that meant we lost our last chance of recovering some rapport just by jamming together. Anyway, it was clear Sting had no real intention of writing any new songs for the Police. It was an empty exercise.&quot;

===1986–2006: disbandment===
The band members continued with their solo careers over the next 20 years. Sting continued recording and touring as a solo performer to great success. Summers recorded several albums, both as a solo artist and in collaboration with other musicians. Copeland became a producer of movie and television soundtracks, and recorded and toured with two new bands, Animal Logic and Oysterhead. A few events brought the Police back together briefly. Summers played guitar on Sting&#x27;s album &quot;...Nothing Like the Sun&quot; (1987), a favour the singer returned by playing bass on Summers&#x27;s album &quot;Charming Snakes&quot; (1990) and later singing lead vocals on &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight&quot; for his tribute to Thelonious Monk &quot;Green Chimneys&quot; (1999). On 2 October 1991 (Sting&#x27;s 40th birthday), Summers joined Sting on stage at the Hollywood Bowl during &quot;The Soul Cages&quot; Tour to perform &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot;, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, and &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;. The performance was broadcast as a pay-per-view event.

On 22 August 1992, Sting married Trudie Styler in an 11th-century chapel in Wiltshire, southwest England. Summers and Copeland were invited to the ceremony and reception. Aware that all band members were present, the wedding guests pressured the trio into playing, and they performed &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;. Copeland said later that &quot;after about three minutes, it became &#x27;the thing&#x27; again&quot;. In 1995 A&amp;M released &quot;Live!&quot;, a double live album produced by Summers featuring two complete concerts—one recorded on 27 November 1979 at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston during the &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; tour, and one recorded on 2 November 1983 at the Omni in Atlanta, Georgia, during the &quot;Synchronicity&quot; Tour (the latter was also documented in the VHS tape &quot;Synchronicity Concert&quot; in 1984).

On 10 March 2003, the Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and performed &quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;, and &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; live, as a group (the last song was performed alongside Steven Tyler, Gwen Stefani, and John Mayer). In late 2003, Sting released his autobiography, &quot;Broken Music&quot;.

In 2004, Copeland and Summers joined Incubus onstage at KROQ&#x27;s Almost Acoustic Christmas concert in Los Angeles performing &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;. In 2004, Henry Padovani released an album with Copeland and Sting playing on one track, reuniting the original Police line-up for the first time since 1977. Also in 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Police No. 70 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

In 2006, Stewart Copeland released a rockumentary about the band called &quot;Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out&quot;, based on Super-8 filming he did when the band was touring and recording in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In October 2006, Andy Summers released &quot;One Train Later&quot;, an autobiographical memoir about his early career and time with the band.

===2007–2008: reunion tour===


In early 2007, reports surfaced the trio would reunite for a tour to mark the Police&#x27;s 30th anniversary, more than 20 years since their split in 1986. On 22 January 2007, the punk wave magazine &quot;Side-Line&quot; broke the story the Police would reunite for the Grammys, and would perform &quot;Roxanne&quot;. Side-Line also stated the Police were to embark on a massive world tour. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine later confirmed the news, quoting Summers&#x27; 2006 statement as to how the band could have continued post-&quot;Synchronicity&quot;: 
 The band opened the 49th Annual Grammy Awards on 11 February 2007 in Los Angeles, announcing, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we are The Police, and we&#x27;re back!&quot; before launching into &quot;Roxanne&quot;.

A&amp;M, the band&#x27;s record company, promoted the 2007–08 reunion tour as the 30th anniversary of the band&#x27;s formation and of the release of their first single for A&amp;M, &quot;Roxanne&quot;. The Police Reunion Tour began in late May 2007 with two shows in Vancouver. Stewart Copeland gave a scathing review of the show on his own website, which the press interpreted as a feud occurring two gigs into the tour. Copeland later apologised for besmirching &quot;my buddy Sting,&quot; and chalked up the comments to &quot;hyper self-criticism&quot;.

Tickets for the British leg of the tour sold out within 30 minutes, and the band played two nights at Twickenham Stadium on 8 and 9 September. On 29 and 30 September 2007, Padovani joined the group on stage for the final encore of their two shows in Paris, playing the song &quot;Next to You&quot; as a four-piece band. In October 2007, the group played the largest gig of the reunion tour in Dublin in front of 82,000 fans. The group headlined the TW Classic festival in Werchter, Belgium on 7 June 2008. They also headlined the last night of the 2008 Isle of Wight Festival on 15 June, the Heineken Jammin&#x27; Festival in Venice on 23 June and the Sunday night at Hard Rock Calling (previously called Hyde Park Calling) in London on 29 June.

In February 2008, the band announced that, when the tour finished, they would break up again. &quot;There will be no new album, no big new tour,&quot; said Sting. &quot;Once we&#x27;re done with our reunion tour, that&#x27;s it for The Police.&quot; The final show of the tour was on 7 August 2008 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The band performed the opening song, &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;, with the brass band of the New York Metropolitan Police Corp. Later, they performed &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; and &quot;Purple Haze&quot; as a tribute to the rock trios that preceded them: Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience. While announcing the show, the group also donated $1 million to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s initiative to plant one million trees in the city by 2017.

The Police were the world&#x27;s highest-earning musicians in 2008, as the tour sold 3.7 million tickets and grossed $358 million, making it the third-highest-grossing tour of all time at its conclusion. On 11 November 2008, the Police released &quot;&quot;, a Blu-ray, DVD and CD set of the band&#x27;s two performances in Buenos Aires, Argentina on the tour (1 and 2 December 2007). Those sets with two DVDs also included a documentary shot by Copeland&#x27;s son Jordan entitled &quot;Better Than Therapy&quot; as well as photographs of Buenos Aires taken by Andy Summers.

==Musical style==
The Police started as a punk rock band, but soon incorporated reggae, pop and new wave elements to their sound. In his retrospective assessment, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic argues that the notion of the Police as a punk rock band was true only &quot;in the loosest sense of the term&quot;. He states the band&#x27;s &quot;nervous, reggae-injected pop/rock was punky&quot; and had a &quot;punk spirit&quot; but it &quot;wasn&#x27;t necessarily punk&quot;. A &quot;power trio&quot;, the Police are also known as a new wave and post-punk band, with many songs falling in the reggae-fusion genre.

==Legacy==

In 2003, the Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Police number 70 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and in 2010, they were ranked 40th on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Four of their five studio albums appeared on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; (number 322), &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; (number 369), &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; (number 434), and &quot;Synchronicity&quot; (number 455). In 2008, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named &quot;Synchronicity&quot; among the top 10 British Albums of the 1980s.

The primary songwriter for the Police, Sting was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2002. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2004 list of the 500 greatest songs of all time, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; ranked number 84 (the highest new wave song on the list), and &quot;Roxanne&quot; ranked number 388. &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; ranked number 65 in the magazine&#x27;s 2008 list of the 100 greatest guitar songs. &quot;Q&quot; magazine named &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; among the top 10 British Songs of the 1980s, and in a UK-wide poll by ITV in 2015 it was voted &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite 80s Number One&quot;. In May 2019, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; was recognized by BMI as being the most performed song in their catalogue, overtaking &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; performed by the Righteous Brothers.
With a string of UK number one albums, the Police were among the most commercially successful British bands of the early 1980s, and with success overseas they are typically regarded as in both the vanguard of the Second British Invasion, and the new wave movement. With a history of playing to large audiences, the Police were a featured artist in the stadium rock episode of the 2007 BBC/VH1 series &quot;Seven Ages of Rock&quot; along with Queen, Led Zeppelin, U2 and Bruce Springsteen.

Despite the band&#x27;s well-documented disagreements with one another, Summers said in 2015 that Sting, Copeland and he are good friends. Summers said, &quot;Despite the general press thing about &#x27;God, they hate each other&#x27;, it&#x27;s actually not true, we&#x27;re very supportive of one another.&quot; While remembering his time with the Police fondly and still retaining love for his former bandmates, Copeland recalled in 2022 that working with Sting musically &quot;was like a Prada suit made out of barbed wire&quot; and that, rather than get involved in the creative infighting, Summers would enjoy &quot;throwing bombs&quot; to egg on the younger men. &quot;It was never an ego-clash&quot;, Copeland said.

<doc id="57322" wikidata="Q154041" url="?curid=57322" title="Frederick II of Denmark">
<text>Frederick II (1 July 1534 – 4 April 1588) was King of Denmark and Norway and Duke of Schleswig and Holstein from 1559 until his death in 1588.

A member of the House of Oldenburg, Frederick began his personal rule of Denmark-Norway at the age of 24. He inherited capable and strong realms, formed in large by his father after the civil war known as the Count&#x27;s Feud, after which Denmark-Norway saw a period of economic recovery and of a great increase in the centralised authority of the Crown.

Frederick was, especially in his youth and unlike his father, belligerent and adversarial, aroused by honor and national pride, and so he began his reign auspiciously with a campaign under the aged Johan Rantzau, which reconquered Dithmarschen. However, after miscalculating the cost of the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War, he pursued a more prudent foreign policy. The remainder of Frederick II&#x27;s reign was a period of tranquillity, in which king and nobles prospered. Frederick spent more time hunting and feasting with his councillors, and focused on architecture and science. During his reign, many building projects were begun, including additions to the royal castles of Kronborg at Elsinore and Frederikborg Castle at Hillerød.

Frederick has to a great extent been overshadowed by his popular, long-reigning son Christian IV, and often been portrayed with skepticism and resentment, resulting in the prevailing portrait of Frederick as a man and as king: an unlettered, inebriated, brutish sot. This portrayal is, however, inequitable and inaccurate, and recent studies reappraise and acknowledge him as highly intelligent; he craved the company of learned men, and in the correspondence and legislation he dictated to his secretaries he showed himself to be quick-witted and articulate. Frederick was also open and loyal, and had a knack for establishing close personal bonds with fellow princes and with those who served him.

In 1572, Frederick married his cousin Sophie of Mecklenburg. Their relationship is regarded as one of the happiest royal marriages in Renaissance Europe. In the first ten years after the wedding, they had seven children, and are described as inseparable and harmonious.

Frederick was committed to becoming the mightiest king in the North, and for several years he fought exhausting wars against his archrival Erik XIV of Sweden, after which the battles changed character. It became a competition to see who could trace their family history the furthest, and who could construct the most formidable castles. In the 1570s he constructed Kronborg, a large Renaissance castle that became widely recognized abroad, and its dance hall was the largest in Northern Europe at the time. He enjoyed entertaining guests and throwing elaborate festivities, which were well known throughout Europe. During the same period, the Danish-Norwegian fleet was developed into one of Europe&#x27;s largest and most modern. As part of his efforts to strengthen the kingdoms, he provided much support for science and culture.

== Early years and education ==
Frederick was born on 1 July 1534 at Haderslevhus Castle, the son of Duke Christian of Schleswig and Holstein (later King Christian III of Denmark and Norway) and Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg, the daughter of Magnus I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg. His mother was the sister of Catherine, the first wife of the Swedish king Gustav Vasa, and the mother of Eric XIV, his future rival.

At the time of Frederick&#x27;s birth, a civil war of Denmark was coming to an end (just three days after Frederick&#x27;s birth his father Christian became King of Denmark). The previous king, Frederick I, died on 10 April the year before, but the Danish Council of the Realm, which traditionally ruled the kingdom with the king, had not chosen a successor, and now Denmark had, for more than a year, functioned as an Aristocratic Republic. The father of the newborn Frederik, Christian, although eldest son of the late king, was not automatically King of Denmark, as the kingship in Denmark was not hereditary, but elective. Noblemen of the Council of the Realm could choose to pick another member of the royal family as king if they so decided.

Frederick I and his son Christian were staunch Protestants and adherents to the Lutheran cause, however, in the Council of the Realm, which consisted of many Catholic bishops as well as a number of powerful noblemen from the old nobility, there were a majority to support the established Catholic Church. After a period of interregnum and after subsequent risings in favour of the former King Christian II, a period known as the Count&#x27;s Feud, Christian III finally became victorious, and was proclaimed King of a new Protestant Denmark.

=== Proclaimed heir apparent ===
After King Christian III&#x27;s victory in the Count&#x27;s Feud, royal power had now returned to Denmark, and in such a way that the king could set his own terms. In his &quot;haandfæstning&quot;, a document which all former Danish Kings must sign, and which regulates the relationship between king and nobility, he reduced the nobility&#x27;s power, and established that the first son of the king should always be seen as heir apparent, and succeed his father automatically.

On 30 October 1536 Christian convened the estates of the realm (&quot;Rigsdag&quot;) to Copenhagen, where they formally proclaimed Frederick heir apparent and successor to the throne, granting him the title &quot;Prince of Denmark&quot;. In 1542, the Prince travelled around Denmark and was hailed by the people. In the Midsummer of 1548 Christian III and his son Frederick, in a fleet of 7 ships and together with 30 Danish nobles, sailed for Oslo, where Frederick was hailed as heir apparent to the Throne of the Kingdom of Norway. The royal reception included Danish nobles holding fiefs in Norway, received by Prince Frederik on his ship. The entire Norwegian nobility had been summoned to Oslo.

=== Upbringing ===
While Christian III secured control of Denmark and Norway, his and Dorothea&#x27;s children grew up in the bosom of the family. In addition to Anna, who was born in 1532, and Frederik from 1534, the group of siblings consisted of Magnus, born 1540, and John, who was born in 1545 and called John the Younger, to distinguish him from Christian III&#x27;s half-brother, John the Elder. Youngest was a girl who was born in 1546 and named after her mother.

It was the usual pedagogical view of the time that parents were so inclined to spoil their own children that the upbringing of the children should be delegated to other members of the family, typically the child&#x27;s maternal grandparents. But Queen Dorothea didn&#x27;t want to send the children away when in infancy. Moreover, her own mother was suspected of nurturing Catholic sympathies, and in the religious era, a Lutheran Danish king could not in good conscience expose his child to Catholic influences. Another contributing factor has probably been the royal couple&#x27;s concern by leaving the children too much out of sight in the tense political situation that prevailed in the first ten years of Frederik&#x27;s life.

=== Education ===
Frederik&#x27;s education, although profound and thorough, was focused on the ecclesiastical and lutheran doctrine, Frederick mainly learning instructions in theology. While a princely educational program, which included learning the art of stewardship, diplomacy and war, was proposed and planned by the Danish Chancellor, it was not executed in full as the Danish Chancellor&#x27;s relationship with Christian III deteriorated before the education could begin.

Life at the court of Christian III and Dorothea was imbued with a fervent Lutheran Christianity with which all their children naturally grew up. In March 1538 Chancellor Wolfgang von Utenhof proposed an educational program for the young Prince Frederick. He was to have a Danish court steward, but he also had to work with and be inspected daily by a chamberlain, who was to be a reliable and sobering man from the Holstein nobility. The prince had to learn Latin, German, Danish, French and other languages, and when he got older he had to learn fencing and other chivalry exercises. He was to have 10–15 young men for company both in his studies and in his chivalrous exercises.

To which extent this educational program was followed is not known. In 1541, Frederick aged 7, he began his schooling. Frederick was appointed Hans Svenning, a reputed Danish humanist and professor of rhetoric at University of Copenhagen, as teacher.

=== Dyslexia ===
Christian III and Dorothea had probably been expecting a lot from Frederick&#x27;s schooling. The son was obviously bright and had a good memory. So much bigger has the disappointment, and the amazement, been when the teaching started. Frederick learned to write beautiful and clear letters, but when it came to reading and spelling, the royal student was &quot;a disaster&quot;.

For Hans Svaning, this deranged spelling of Frederick&#x27;s could only be seen as sloppy and laziness, given that the royal boy otherwise seemed smart enough. Time and time again, Frederick has been punished, probably not only by the teacher, but also by his strict mother, who would gladly step in if Svaning&#x27;s teaching was not sufficient.

Because of Frederick&#x27;s heavy dyslexia, he was perceived by his contemporaries as unlettered and illiterate. Both Frederick&#x27;s father and mother looked with skepticism at the heir to the throne, and they kept him under the watchful eye of knowledgeable men as far as possible to prevent him from publicly speaking out. Neither did his father entrust Frederik with any administrative duties.

=== Malmøhus ===

It was only at the age of 20 in 1554 that Frederik was allowed to hold his own court at Malmö Castle in Scania, but under the supervision of the middle-aged lensman (&#x27;Fief-man&#x27;) Ejler Hardenberg, who was appointed the prince&#x27;s court master. At the same time, political training began, which was put in the hands of the two driven noblemen Eiler Rønnow and Erik Rosenkrantz. The years in Scania, must have felt like a liberation for Frederick. He had finally escaped from the royal court with its tightly regulated existences and pious daily lives. Just outside the moats around Malmö Castle was the lively trading town of Malmö, which offered a young man all-out experiences.

While spending many of his youth years in Scania, he became known as the &quot;Prince of Scania&quot; (&quot;princeps Scaniæ&quot;) (). It is not known whether this title was ever officially decreed to him.

=== Travels to Germany with his brother-in-law ===
The only political education that Frederik received came from his close friendship with his brother-in-law, Elector Augustus of Saxony (reigned 1553–86). Some authors have later stated that Augustus was &quot;the only strong emotional support&quot; Frederick received in his youth.

Augustus, who was the husband of Frederik&#x27;s elder sister Anne, took Frederik under his wing, chaperoning him on a trip throughout the Holy Roman Empire in 1557–58. Here Frederik made the acquaintance of the new emperor, Ferdinand I (reigned 1558–64) at his coronation, his son and heir apparent Maximilian (emperor 1564–76), William of Orange, and a host of other more prominent German Protestant princes. The experience nurtured in Frederik a lasting appreciation of the great complexity of German politics and a taste for all things military.

This was most troubling to Frederick&#x27;s father, the ageing Christian III, who feared that in the Empire Frederick would develop ambitions that would exceed both his abilities and the resources of his kingdoms, and that the trip would ultimately drag Denmark-Norway into the maelstrom of German princely politics.

=== Peder Oxe ===
In 1552, Steward of the Realm, Peder Oxe (1520–1575), had been raised to Councillor of State (&quot;Rigsraad&quot;). During the spring of 1557, Oxe and the King had quarreled over a mutual property exchange. Failing to compromise matters with the King, Oxe had fled to Germany in 1558.

== Reign ==

=== Proclaimed King ===
Frederick&#x27;s father Christian III died on 1 January 1559 at Koldinghus. Frederick was not present at his father&#x27;s bedside when he died, a circumstance that did not endear the new king, now King Frederick II of Denmark-Norway, to the councillors who had grown to appreciate and revere Christian.

On 12 August 1559 Frederick signed his haandfæstning (lit. &quot;Handbinding&quot; viz. curtailment of the monarch&#x27;s power, a Danish parallel to the Magna Carta) and on 20 August 1559 Frederick II was crowned at the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen by a Danish superintendent, with Nicolaus Palladius and Jens Skielderup two Norwegian superintendent assisting, symbolizing the relationship between the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway. Week-long and elaborate celebrations are said to have taken place after the coronation.

=== Conquest of Ditmarschen ===

Within weeks of Christian&#x27;s passing, Frederick joined with his uncles in Holstein, John and Adolf, in a military campaign to conquer the Ditmarschen, under Johan Rantzau. Frederik II&#x27;s great-uncle, King John, had failed to subjugate the peasant republic in 1500, but the Frederick&#x27;s 1559-campaign was a quick and relatively painless victory for the Danish Kingdom. The brevity and low cost of the campaign were cold comforts to the members of the Council of the Realm, Johan Friis in particular. Friis had warned Frederick that a very real threat of conflict with Sweden loomed just over the horizon, but the king had not listened, and had not even consulted with the Council about the Ditmarschen.

=== Early relationship with the Council of the Realm ===
The adversarial king–Council relationship improved relatively quickly however, and not because Frederik caved in to conciliar opposition. Rather, the two parties quickly learned to work together because their interests, and the Kingdom&#x27;s, required that they did so. From an early time, the council invested much power in Frederick, as they had no desire to go back to the destructive near-anarchy of the pre-civil war years.

Frederik would soon learn how to play the constitutional game, that is required in a consensual monarchy, such as Denmark; namely to humour the Council without sacrificing his own royal interests. This meant showing generosity to the conciliar aristocracy through various gifts and concessions, which he did in grand style. Shortly before the signing of his coronation charter (&quot;haandfæstning&quot;), Andreas von Barby, leader of the German Chancery, died. Barby was not well liked in the Council of the Realm, but he was extreamly wealthy. The extensive fiefs in his possession reverted to the Crown, and Frederik was careful to distribute out these properties among the leading members of the Council of the Realm. Throughout his reign, Frederik would reward his conciliar aristocracy generously. Fiefs were distributed on highly favourable terms.

The substantially warmer relationship between king and Council of the Realm after the Ditmarschen campaign is best illustrated by the Danish central administration&#x27;s performance in the greatest national crisis of the reign, the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War (1563–70) against Sweden.

=== Relationship with Livonia ===
From his predecessor, Frederick inherited the Livonian War. In 1560, he installed his younger brother, Magnus of Holstein (1540–1583), in the Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek. King Frederick II largely tried to avoid conflict in Livonia and consolidated amicable relations with Tsar Ivan IV of Russia in the 1562 Treaty of Mozhaysk. His brother Magnus was later made titular King of Livonia, as a vassal of Tsar Ivan IV.

=== Northern Seven Years&#x27; War ===
King Frederick&#x27;s competition with Sweden for supremacy in the Baltic broke out into open warfare in 1563, the start of the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War, the dominating conflict of his rule.

The leading councillors, Johan Friis foremost among them, had feared a Swedish onslaught for several years, and after the succession of Frederick II&#x27;s first cousin, the ambitious and unbalanced Eric XIV (reigned 1560–1568) to the Vasa throne a confrontation appeared inevitable. Still, few councillors wanted war, and they preferred to wait until it was forced upon them, while Frederik preferred a preemptive strike. Despite its initial opposition to the war, the Council of the Realm went along with the king. Frederik II, wisely, made no effort to exclude the council from the direction of the war, and though he retained chief operational control he entrusted much responsibility to his councillors, including Holger Ottesen Rosenkrants, Marshal Otte Krumpen, and Admiral Herluf Trolle.

Only one constitutional crisis emerged during the war; in late 1569, after six years of war, the Council decided not to provide the king with further grants of taxation. The war had been costly, both in lives and in gold, but since 1565 Denmark-Norway had made no appreciable gains. The council had already asked Frederik to make peace, and he had made a half-hearted attempt to do so in 1568, but neither Frederik nor his Swedish opponent was willing to concede defeat.

The war developed into an extremely expensive war of attrition in which the areas of Scania were ravaged by the Swedes, and Norway was almost lost. During this war, King Frederick II led his army personally on the battlefield, but although with some small success, overall without much result.

The council, in cutting off financial support, had hoped to coerce the king into ending the war. Frederik felt betrayed, and after some reflection, Frederick felt that the only honourable recourse was abdication. With his letter of resignation in the hands of the councillors, he left the capital to go hunting in the countryside. The king, still unmarried, had no heir, and consequently the Council of the Realm had good reason to fear another leaderless interregnum and even another civil war. It played into the king&#x27;s hands; the Council begging for his return to the throne and allowed him to summon a Diet to consider additional tax levies.

The conflict damaged his relationship with his noble councillors; however, the later Sture murders of 24 May 1567 by the insane King Eric XIV in Sweden, eventually helped stabilize the situation in Denmark-Norway. After King John III of Sweden, King Eric&#x27;s successor, refused to accept a peace favoring Denmark-Norway in the Treaties of Roskilde (1568), the ongoing war dragged on until it was ended by a status quo peace in the Treaty of Stettin (1570), that let Denmark-Norway save face but also show limits of Danish and Norwegian military power.

Frederik II learned a great deal about kingship during the war with Sweden. He learned to include the Council of the Realm in most matters of policy, but he also learned that it was possible to manipulate the council, even to bend it to his own will, without humiliating it or undermining its authority. He would later come to master this ability and use it extensively.

=== Later reign ===
During the eighteen remaining years of his reign, Frederik would come to drew extensively on the lessons he learned in the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War with Eric XIV of Sweden. In the peacetime years, he maintained a rather peripatetic court, moving from residence to residence throughout the Danish countryside, spending a fair share of his time in hunting. This allowed him the opportunity to meet members of the Council individually and informally, in their home regions. As was required of the Danish King, he did summon the Council of the Realm once annually to meet at the &quot;herredag&quot;, but most of his business with the council was done on a one-to-one basis. This ensured a very close personal bond with each member of the council while minimizing the opportunity for the council to oppose him as a full body. Frederik&#x27;s personable disposition also helped, and so, too, did the informal nature of court life under Frederik II. The king hunted, feasted, and drank with his noble councillors and advisers, and even with visiting foreign dignitaries, treating them as his equal peers and companions rather than as political opponents or inferiors. The eighteenth-century chronicler Ludvig Holberg claimed that when dining at his court, Frederik would frequently announce that &#x27;the king is not at home&#x27;, which signalled to his guests that all court formalities were temporarily suspended, and that they could talk and joke as they pleased without restraint. The Danish court of Frederick II may have appeared to be unsophisticated to outside observers, but the openness and bawdiness of court life served Frederik&#x27;s political purposes. In 1585, he visited Norway for the first and only time as king, but only went to Bohuslen.

==== Financial situation ====
The great cost of the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War, some 1.1 million rigsdaler, was recovered chiefly from higher taxation on both Danish and Norwegian farm properties. After state finances collapsed in the aftermath of the war, King Frederick II called Peder Oxe home to address the kingdom&#x27;s economy. The taking over of Danish administration and finances by the able councillor, provided a marked improvement for the national treasury. Councillors of experience, including Niels Kaas, Arild Huitfeldt, and Christoffer Valkendorff, took care of the domestic administration. Subsequently, government finances were put in order and Denmark-Norway&#x27;s economy improved. One of the chief expedients of the improved state of affairs was the raising of the Sound Dues. Oxe, as lord treasurer, reduced the national debt considerably and redeemed portions of crown lands.

=== Constructions in reign ===

After the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War a period of affluence and growth followed in Danish-Norwegian history. The greater financial liquidity of the crown and the king&#x27;s decreased dependence on the Council for funding, while not meaning that Frederick was actively seeking to sidestep conciliar control, it did allow him to be less frugal than his late father, Christian III, had been. Considerable funds were devoted to an expansion of the Danish-Norwegian fleet and of the facilities for its support, not merely for security purposes but also to aid Frederick&#x27;s active endeavours to rid the Baltic Sea of pirates. The increased revenues likewise enabled Frederik to undertake the construction of Denmark&#x27;s first national road network, the so-called &quot;kongevej&quot; (&#x27;King&#x27;s Road&#x27;), connecting the larger towns and the royal residences.

The most visible area of expenditure, however, was the royal castles and the court itself. Frederick spent freely on the reconstruction of several royal residences and other cities:

* Antvorskov (near Slagelse, Sjælland), was one of Frederick&#x27;s favourite hunting-castles. He later died at Antvorskov.
* In 1567, King Frederick II founded Fredrikstad in Norway. Frederik II Upper Secondary School in Fredrikstad, one of the largest schools of its kind in Norway, is named after Frederick.
* He also rebuilt Kronborg in Elsinore from a medieval fortress into a magnificent Renaissance castle, between 1574 and 1585.
* In 1560 Frederick converted the North Sealand farm Hillerødsholm into a great Renaissance castle, Frederiksborg.
* In 1561, Frederik II developed and fortified Skanderborg Castle with materials from Øm Abbey.

For all Frederick&#x27;s egalitarian behaviour at his court, Frederick was acutely aware of his elevated status. Like most monarchs of his day, he sought to bolster his international reputation through a measure of ostentatious display, in his patronage of artists and musicians, as well as in the elaborate ceremonies staged for royal weddings and other public celebrations.

=== Kronborg and &quot;The King&#x27;s Sound&quot; ===

Frederick II had claimed naval supremacy in &#x27;the king&#x27;s sound&#x27;, as he called The Sound and, indeed, the whole expanse of waters lying between his Norwegian and Icelandic possessions. In 1583 he secured an agreement by which England made an annual payment for permission to sail there, and France later followed suit.

He also tried to bring the Icelandic trade and fisheries into the hands of his own subjects instead of Englishmen and Germans and encouraged adventurers such as Magnus Heinason, to whom he gave a monopoly of trade with the Faeroes, a half-share in ships captured on unlawful passage to the White Sea, and backing for a bold but unsuccessful attempt to reach east Greenland.

== Relationship with the Church ==
The necessity of maintaining order within the church meant that royal interference into ecclesiastical affairs was unavoidable. There was no longer an archbishop within the hierarchy, so the king was the final authority in matters that could not be settled by the bishops alone. As his father, Christian III, put it, kings were the &#x27;father to the superintendents&#x27;.

As protector of the church and therefore of the clergy, Frederick frequently intervened in disputes between clergy and laity, even when the issues involved were trivial ones.

Frederik II, repeatedly came to the defence of new parish priests whose congregations tried to force them to marry their predecessors&#x27; widows, and sometimes to protect preachers from the wrath of overbearing noblemen. Conversely, the king – and especially Frederik II – would see to it personally that unruly, incompetent, or disreputable priests lost their parishes, or he would pardon those who had been punished by their superintendents for minor infractions. Protecting and disciplining the clergy was, after all, part of the king&#x27;s obligation to the state church.

Frederik II was more active than his late father in extending his royal authority into areas that the 1537 Ordinance had protected from secular power. Frederik consulted with members of the theological faculty at the University of Copenhagen—the so-called &#x27;most learned ones&#x27; (&quot;højlærde&quot;)—but he did not shy away from making changes in the most minute liturgical matters. He stipulated the books that every parish priest should have in his library, set standardized times for worship services in the towns, and set minimal standards of competence for all preachers.
Although Frederick interfered much in ecclesiastical affairs, Paul Douglas Lockhart pointed out, that Frederick &quot;was not interested in dictating conscience&quot;, stating that &quot;he wanted only to prevent useless religious disputes, disputes that could weaken the kingdom and leave it vulnerable to Catholic aggression&quot;.

=== Book of Concord ===

A good testimony of Frederik&#x27;s stubborn resistance to all religious controversy can be found in his response to the late sixteenth-century Lutheran statement of faith, the Formula and Book of Concord. The &#x27;Concord&#x27;, which was written by leading Saxon divines and sponsored by Frederik II&#x27;s brother-in-law, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, was an attempt to promote unity among the German Lutheran princes. As a unifier, however, the Concord was an abject failure.

August had recently purged his court of Calvinists and Philippists, and orthodox Lutherans like Jacob Andreae composed the document. The Concord was extremely orthodox. Frederik II had already clashed with his old friend and companion Augustus over theological issues: in 1575, Augustus had complained profoundly about the Calvinist sentiments expounded by Niels Hemmingsen in the treatise Syntagma institutionum christianarum (1574). Though Frederik tried to defend Hemmingsen, who was his favourite divine, he also wanted to keep Augustus&#x27; friendship, and he therefor dismissed Hemmingsen – with honour – from his post at the University of Copenhagen in 1579. Frederik was not nearly so receptive to August&#x27;s promotion of the Concord.

Like many other contemporaries of his time, Frederick believed that the Book of Concord promoted discord, and not harmony. Ignoring Augustus&#x27;s warnings that a Calvinist plot had taken root in Denmark&#x27;s clergy, he banned the Concord from his lands in July 1580. Possession of the book, or even discussion of its contents, would be punished severely. The king burned his own personal copies, which were sent to him by his sister Anne, wife of Augustus. The Concord, he argued, contained &quot;teachings which are foreign and alien to us and to our churches, [and which] could easily disrupt the unity which ... these kingdoms have hitherto maintained&quot;.

=== Marriage Ordinance ===
Frederik II&#x27;s &#x27;Marriage Ordinance&#x27; of 1582, inspired by Niels Hemmingsen&#x27;s writings on the institution, allowed divorce for a wide range of reasons, including infidelity, impotence, leprosy, venereal disease, and outlawry.

== Areas of interest ==

=== University of Copenhagen ===
Frederick was a great patron of the University of Copenhagen, where he introduced educational reforms in the 1570s and 1580s. Frederik increased the university&#x27;s budget almost exponentially, expanding the size of its teaching staff and providing substantially higher salaries. While demanding higher educational standards from the priesthood, Frederick and his advisers provided more support for impoverished students. One hundred students, selected by the faculty, received room and board free of fee from the crown, each for a period of five years. Four especially promising students would be awarded the &quot;stipendium regium&quot;, which paid all costs for study abroad so long as the recipient returned to Copenhagen to finish his doctorate.

=== Medicine ===
The interests of Frederik II and his intellectual circle of wise men were more wide-ranging than that of his father&#x27;s theological one. Frederik had a strong proclivity for Paracelsian medicine: in 1571 he appointed Johannes Pratensis to the medical faculty of the University of Copenhagen, and in the same year Petrus Severinus became his personal physician. Severinus wielded considerable influence among Paracelsian practitioners, following the publication of his Idea &quot;medicinæ philosophicæ&quot; (1571).

=== Alchemy, astrology and Tycho Brahe ===

Frederik II&#x27;s fascination with alchemy and astrology, common to contemporary sovereigns, sped the rise of the astronomer Tycho Brahe to international renown as a pioneer in Europe&#x27;s Scientific Revolution. Tyge Brahe came from the highest ranks of the Danish ruling elite: his father, Otte Brahe til Knudstrup, was a fiefholder in Scania and a member of the Council of the Realm, as was Tyge&#x27;s brother .

After an extensive education abroad, Tycho Brahe returned to Denmark not to pursue a career in state service as men of his blood typically did, but instead retreated to the monastery at Herrevad, where he and his maternal uncle Sten Bille experimented with the manufacture of paper and glass and maintained a private observatory. Brahe&#x27;s treatise on the supernova that appeared in Cassiopeia in November 1572, published at the behest of the rigshofmester Peder Oxe, brought his activities to the attention of Frederik and his court. At the king&#x27;s insistence, Brahe took up a lectureship at the University of Copenhagen in 1574, and two years later he was granted the island of Ven as his fief. As a fiefholder, he turned out to be a minor disaster, but the observatory at his residence, Uraniborg, drew students from all over Europe. From 1576 until his expulsion by Christian IV in 1597, Brahe supervised the first publicly funded scientific research institute in European history.

=== Character as patron of science ===
In his later life, Frederik was fiscally cautious in all matters of state, but he gave an abundance of royal support when it was directed towards the life of the mind. Even after he dismissed Hemmingsen from the University of Copenhagen in 1579, for example, he made sure that the theologian still had a gracious salary and the opportunity to study. Tycho Brahe received not only Ven as a &#x27;free fief&#x27;, but also several other fiefs, canonries, and farms in Scania to fund his work at Uraniborg.

Frederik himself picked out the island of Ven as a place where Brahe could conduct his experiments without distraction. Perhaps the king was driven, in part, by a desire to enhance Denmark&#x27;s reputation among the great nations of Europe, but even so he demonstrated a finely tuned appreciation for intellectual talent.

As Frederick is alleged to have said to Brahe:

=== Hunting, drinking and feasting ===

Frederick&#x27;s areas of interest did not consist only of theological and scientific ones. Frederick is known very well for his love of hunting, drinking and feasting. In his youth and in the start of his reign this was a way for Frederick to get away from the Danish court and its formalities. However, in Frederick&#x27;s later reign he began using hunting and feasting as a political tool. In the peacetime years of his reign, Frederick would maintain a peripatetic court, moving from residence to residence throughout the Danish countryside, spending a fair share of his time hunting. This allowed him the opportunity to meet members of the Council individually and informally, in their own home regions. Most of his business with the Council of the Realm was therefor done on a one-to-one basis. This ensured a very close personal bond with each member of the council while minimizing the opportunity for the council to oppose him as a body. Frederik&#x27;s personable disposition undoubtedly helped.

==== Informal nature of court life ====
The king hunted, feasted, and drank with his councillors and advisers, and even with visiting European foreign dignitaries, treating them as his peers and companions rather than as political opponents or inferiors. The eighteenth-century chronicler Ludvig Holberg claimed that when dining at the court of Frederick II, he would frequently announce that &#x27;the king is not at home&#x27;, which signalled to his guests that all court formalities were temporarily suspended, and that they could talk and joke as they pleased without restraint. The Danish court may have appeared unsophisticated to outside observers, but the openness and bawdiness of court life served Frederik&#x27;s political purposes.

==Youth and marriage==

=== Anne Hardenberg ===
As a young man, Frederick II had desired to marry the noblewoman, Anne Hardenberg, who had served as a lady-in-waiting to his mother, the Dowager Queen Dorothea of Denmark, however as she was not of princely birth, this was impossible. There is no evidence that either of them had any interest in entering a morganatic marriage and Anne Hardenberg was married six months after Frederick, after which there is no known contact between them.

=== Possible matrimonies ===
Negotiations to find a suitable royal bride were manifold during the 1560s, but mostly it came to nothing, often because Frederick strongly insisted on meeting the prospective bride before committing to her. The proposed matrimonies included:

* Renata of Lorraine: Throughout the 1550s, Frederick&#x27;s father Christian III strongly advocated a marriage alliance with the House of Lorraine, hoping that a match between his son Prince Frederik and claimant to the Danish throne Christina of Denmark&#x27;s daughter Renata, would settle the claimant disputes, and possibly even add Lorraine to the Oldenburg patrimony. The match never took place—Frederik was indifferent to it, many of the king&#x27;s advisers opposed it, and Christina was none too cooperative – but it remained Christian III&#x27;s fervent hope to the end of his days.
*Juliana of Nassau: Throughout the 1560s, a marriage between Frederick and William of Orange&#x27;s sister, Juliana, was heavily considered. Frederick and the Danish Council of State wanted to strengthen relations with other Protestant powers, and the relationship between Frederick and William was very positive, and they kept close confidential correspondence right up until Frederick&#x27;s death. The marriage failed due to high political complications, as Frederick did not want to appear as an obvious supporter of one of Spain&#x27;s enemies.
* Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots.
* He had also wooed Queen Elizabeth I of England, but to no avail, and was later made a Knight of the Garter.
* A daughter of Emperor Ferdinand I.
* A daughter of Albert V, Duke of Bavaria.
* Margaret of Pomerania: Frederick&#x27;s aunt Elizabeth of Denmark, introduced Frederick to the 17-years-old Margaret of Pomerania, but Frederick was instead interested in Elizabeth&#x27;s daughter Sophie.

=== Marriage to Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow ===

On 20 July 1572, he was married to Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, a descendant of King John of Denmark, and also his own first half-cousin, through their grandfather, Frederick I, King of Denmark and Norway.

Sophie was the daughter of Ulrich III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Elizabeth of Denmark. Their marriage was harmonious and happy. Sophie is consistently mentioned in Frederick&#x27;s handwritten diary as &quot;mynt Soffye&quot;, meaning &quot;my Sophie&quot; and she followed him through the country as the court was very mobile. Queen Sophie was a loving mother, nursing her children personally during their illnesses. When Frederick was sick with malaria in 1575, she personally nursed him and wrote many worried letters to her father about his progress.

After Frederick&#x27;s death Sophie was granted a &#x27;Dowager-pension&#x27; (), consisting of Nykøbing Castle and the islands of Lolland and Falster. The Dowager Queen Sophie managed her estates in Lolland-Falster so well that her son could borrow money from her on several occasions for his wars.

== Issue ==
Frederick and Sophie had seven children:
== Death and burial ==
King Frederick II died on 4 April 1588, aged 53, at Antvorskov.

Frederick was buried on 5 August 1588 in Christian I&#x27;s chapel at Roskilde Cathedral, where his son King Christian IV later built a large monument in honour of his late father.

== Legacy ==
Many recent historians, such as Poul Grinder-Hansen, Paul Douglas Lockhart, Thomas Kingston Derry and Frede P. Jensen have expressed, that it is difficult to see how the reign, and especially the later reign, of Frederik II could be viewed as anything other than a resounding success. Frederick&#x27;s character have throughout time been misinterpreted by Danish historians as unlettered, foolish and stupid; leaving state affairs to his councillors to go hunting in the countryside.

However, this is incorrect, and Frederick was highly intelligent. He craved the company of learned men, who composed his inner circle of intellectuals, and they had many interests, including medicine, alchemy, astrology and theology. As Paul Douglas Lockhart later stated: &quot;Frederik II may have been a near illiterate (...) but nonetheless he was enlightened as few monarchs of his generation were. It is difficult to see how Danish historians for so long laboured under the impression that he was little better than a drunken fool&quot;.

=== Classical and more recent portrayal ===
The negative portrayal of Frederik II was founded by the cultural historian Troels Frederik Lund in his 1906 biography of Peder Oxe, who in his opinion saved Denmark on the brink of abyss against the foolhardy young king and his German war-mad officers. This portrayal was continued by Erik Arup, he wrote:

Often described as wilful and impatient, he was easily moved to anger, and by his early twenties had exhibited a weakness for strong drink and an addiction to the hunt. These are the traits upon which Danish historians have most often focused, resulting in the prevailing portrait of Frederik as a man and as king: an unlettered, inebriated, brutish sot, who virtually abdicated his responsibilities of king in favour of hunting and binge drinking.

This portrayal is, however, unfair and inaccurate, and thanks to the research of Frede P. Jensen it has been redrawn. Frede P. Jensen (1940–2008), after thorough archival studies, was one of the first historians in Denmark who, in his works, radically changed the view of the King Frederick II.

Frederik was indeed no great scholar, owing largely to the fact that he was very dyslexic. Throughout his entire life he would struggle with his difficulty in reading and writing, and it embarrassed him immensely. But he was, as those close to him would attest, highly intelligent; he craved the company of learned men, and in the correspondence and legislation he dictated to his secretaries he showed himself to be quick-witted and articulate. Frederik was also open and loyal, and had a knack for establishing close personal bonds with fellow princes and with those who served him. These qualities would make him an ideal politician. Indeed, Frederik would take the chief legacy of his father&#x27;s kingship – the close symbiosis between king and aristocracy – to its logical limits, and simultaneously would bring Denmark to the height of its power and influence in European affairs.

The rebirth of the University of Copenhagen and the professionalization of the central administration, coupled with the prominence of learned men within the king&#x27;s inner circle, gave the court of Frederik II a uniquely refined and scholarly character that was lacking in his father&#x27;s court. This, in turn, gave rise to increased intellectual activity throughout the realm. Literature, mostly theological, blossomed in the second half of the century.

Geranium is a genus of 422 species of annual, biennial, and perennial plants that are commonly known as geraniums or cranesbills. They are found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, with the greatest diversity in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region.

The palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple, or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring.

Geraniums are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, ghost moth, and mouse moth. At least several species of &quot;Geranium&quot; are gynodioecious. The species &quot;Geranium viscosissimum&quot; (sticky geranium) is considered to be protocarnivorous.

==Name==
The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek (&quot;géranos&quot;) &#x27;crane&#x27;. The English name &#x27;cranesbill&#x27; derives from the resemblance of the fruit capsule of some of the species to a crane&#x27;s head and bill. The ovary portion forms the head and the prolonged stigma creates the appearance of a beak.

== Description ==
The flowers are typically five-petaled and white to purple. The leaves are palmate divided into narrow, pointed segments.

The fruit capsule consists of five cells joined to a column produced from the centre of the flower. The cells form lobes which eventually separate, each containing one seed. When the fruit is ripe, the beak-like stigma springs open and casts the ovoid, streamlined seeds some distance, dispersing the seeds.

==Confusion with &quot;Pelargonium&quot;==
Confusingly, &quot;geranium&quot; is also the common name of members of the genus &quot;Pelargonium&quot;, which are also in the family Geraniaceae and are widely grown as horticultural bedding plants. Linnaeus originally included all the species in one genus, &quot;Geranium&quot;, but they were later separated into two genera by Charles L’Héritier in 1789. Other former members of the genus are now classified in &quot;Erodium&quot;, including the plants known as filarees in North America.

The term &quot;hardy geranium&quot; is often applied to horticultural &quot;Geranium&quot;s to distinguish them from the &quot;Pelargonium&quot;s, which are not winter-hardy in temperate horticulture. However, not all &quot;Geranium&quot; species are winter-hardy (see below).

The shape of the flowers offers one way of distinguishing between the two genera &quot;Geranium&quot; and &quot;Pelargonium&quot;. &quot;Geranium&quot; flowers have five very similar petals, and are thus radially symmetrical (actinomorphic), whereas &quot;Pelargonium&quot; (and also &quot;Erodium&quot;) flowers have two upper petals which are different from the three lower petals, so the flowers have a single plane of symmetry (zygomorphic).

==Cultivation==
A number of geranium species are cultivated for horticultural use and for pharmaceutical products. Some of the more commonly grown species include:

All the above species are perennials and generally winter-hardy plants, grown for their attractive flowers and foliage. They are long-lived and most have a mounding habit, with palmately lobed foliage. Some species have spreading rhizomes. They are normally grown in part shade to full sun, in well-draining but moisture retentive soils, rich in humus. Other perennial species grown for their flowers and foliage include: &quot;Geranium argenteum&quot;, &quot;G. eriostemon&quot;, &quot;G. farreri&quot;, &quot;G. nodosum&quot;, &quot;G. procurrens&quot;, &quot;G. pylzowianum&quot;, &quot;G. renardii&quot;, &quot;G. traversii&quot;, &quot;G. tuberosum&quot;, &quot;G. versicolor&quot;, &quot;G. wallichianum&quot;, and &quot;G. wlassovianum&quot;. Some of these are not winter-hardy in cold areas and are grown in specialized gardens like rock gardens. &quot;Geranium&quot; &#x27;Johnson&#x27;s Blue&#x27; is a hybrid between &quot;G. himalayense&quot; (southwestern China), with &quot;G. pratense&quot; (European meadow cranesbill).

<text>Geranium cinereum, the ashy cranesbill, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae, native to the Pyrenees. Growing to tall and wide, it is a small, deciduous or semi-evergreen perennial usually grown for low ground cover, rockeries or underplanting larger subjects like roses. Leaves are deeply divided and grey-green – whence the Latin specific epithet &quot;cinereum&quot; &quot;ash-grey&quot;. It flowers in summer, with striking black-eyed flowers with black stamens. 
The plant grows in full sunlight, and is hardy down to .

In cultivation in the UK the following cultivars in the Cinereum Group have been given a Royal Horticultural Society Award of Garden Merit:-

<doc id="57326" wikidata="Q190556" url="?curid=57326" title="De Moivre's formula">
<text>In mathematics, de Moivre&#x27;s formula (also known as de Moivre&#x27;s theorem and de Moivre&#x27;s identity) states that for any real number and integer it is the case that
formula_1
where is the imaginary unit (). The formula is named after Abraham de Moivre, although he never stated it in his works. The expression is sometimes abbreviated to .

The formula is important because it connects complex numbers and trigonometry. By expanding the left hand side and then comparing the real and imaginary parts under the assumption that is real, it is possible to derive useful expressions for and in terms of and .

As written, the formula is not valid for non-integer powers . However, there are generalizations of this formula valid for other exponents. These can be used to give explicit expressions for the th roots of unity, that is, complex numbers such that .

Using the standard extensions of the sine and cosine functions to complex numbers, the formula is valid even when is an arbitrary complex number.

==Example==
For formula_2 and formula_3, de Moivre&#x27;s formula asserts that
formula_4
or equivalently that
formula_5
In this example, it is easy to check the validity of the equation by multiplying out the left side.

==Relation to Euler&#x27;s formula==
De Moivre&#x27;s formula is a precursor to Euler&#x27;s formula
formula_6
with expressed in radians rather than degrees, which establishes the fundamental relationship between the trigonometric functions and the complex exponential function. 

One can derive de Moivre&#x27;s formula using Euler&#x27;s formula and the exponential law for integer powers

:formula_7

since Euler&#x27;s formula implies that the left side is equal to formula_8 while the right side is equal to formula_9

== Proof by induction ==
The truth of de Moivre&#x27;s theorem can be established by using mathematical induction for natural numbers, and extended to all integers from there. For an integer , call the following statement :

:formula_10

For , we proceed by mathematical induction. is clearly true. For our hypothesis, we assume is true for some natural . That is, we assume

:formula_11

Now, considering :

:formula_12

See angle sum and difference identities.

We deduce that implies . By the principle of mathematical induction it follows that the result is true for all natural numbers. Now, is clearly true since . Finally, for the negative integer cases, we consider an exponent of for natural .

:formula_13
The equation (*) is a result of the identity
:formula_14
for . Hence, holds for all integers .

== Formulae for cosine and sine individually ==

For an equality of complex numbers, one necessarily has equality both of the real parts and of the imaginary parts of both members of the equation. If , and therefore also and , are real numbers, then the identity of these parts can be written using binomial coefficients. This formula was given by 16th century French mathematician François Viète:

:formula_15

In each of these two equations, the final trigonometric function equals one or minus one or zero, thus removing half the entries in each of the sums. These equations are in fact valid even for complex values of , because both sides are entire (that is, holomorphic on the whole complex plane) functions of , and two such functions that coincide on the real axis necessarily coincide everywhere. Here are the concrete instances of these equations for and :

:formula_16

The right-hand side of the formula for is in fact the value of the Chebyshev polynomial at .

== Failure for non-integer powers, and generalization ==
De Moivre&#x27;s formula does not hold for non-integer powers. The derivation of de Moivre&#x27;s formula above involves a complex number raised to the integer power . If a complex number is raised to a non-integer power, the result is multiple-valued (see failure of power and logarithm identities).

===Roots of complex numbers===
A modest extension of the version of de Moivre&#x27;s formula given in this article can be used to find the -th roots of a complex number for a non-zero integer . (This is equivalent to raising to a power of ).

If is a complex number, written in polar form as

: formula_17

then the -th roots of are given by

: formula_18

where varies over the integer values from 0 to .

This formula is also sometimes known as de Moivre&#x27;s formula.

===Complex numbers raised to an arbitrary power===
Generally, if formula_19 (in polar form) and are arbitrary complex numbers, then the set of possible values is
formula_20
(Note that if is a rational number that equals in lowest terms then this set will have exactly distinct values rather than infinitely many. In particular, if is an integer then the set will have exactly one value, as previously discussed.) In contrast, de Moivre&#x27;s formula gives
formula_21
which is just the single value from this set corresponding to .

== Analogues in other settings ==

===Hyperbolic trigonometry===

Since , an analog to de Moivre&#x27;s formula also applies to the hyperbolic trigonometry. For all integers ,

: formula_22

If is a rational number (but not necessarily an integer), then will be one of the values of .

=== Extension to complex numbers ===

For any integer , the formula holds for any complex number formula_23
:formula_24
where
: formula_25

=== Quaternions ===

To find the roots of a quaternion there is an analogous form of de Moivre&#x27;s formula. A quaternion in the form
:formula_26
can be represented in the form
:formula_27
In this representation,
:formula_28
and the trigonometric functions are defined as
:formula_29
In the case that ,
:formula_30
that is, the unit vector. This leads to the variation of De Moivre&#x27;s formula:

:formula_31

====Example====
To find the cube roots of
:formula_32
write the quaternion in the form
:formula_33
Then the cube roots are given by:
:formula_34

===2 × 2 matrices===
With matrices, formula_35 when is an integer. This is a direct consequence of the isomorphism between the matrices of type formula_36 and the complex plane.

<text>Abraham de Moivre FRS (; 26 May 166727 November 1754) was a French mathematician known for de Moivre&#x27;s formula, a formula that links complex numbers and trigonometry, and for his work on the normal distribution and probability theory.

He moved to England at a young age due to the religious persecution of Huguenots in France which reached a climax in 1685 with the Edict of Fontainebleau.
He was a friend of Isaac Newton, Edmond Halley, and James Stirling. Among his fellow Huguenot exiles in England, he was a colleague of the editor and translator Pierre des Maizeaux.

De Moivre wrote a book on probability theory, &quot;The Doctrine of Chances&quot;, said to have been prized by gamblers. De Moivre first discovered Binet&#x27;s formula, the closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers linking the &quot;n&quot;th power of the golden ratio &quot;φ&quot; to the &quot;n&quot;th Fibonacci number. He also was the first to postulate the central limit theorem, a cornerstone of probability theory.

==Life==
===Early years===
Abraham de Moivre was born in Vitry-le-François in Champagne on 26 May 1667. His father, Daniel de Moivre, was a surgeon who believed in the value of education. Though Abraham de Moivre&#x27;s parents were Protestant, he first attended the Christian Brothers&#x27; Catholic school in Vitry, which was unusually tolerant given religious tensions in France at the time. When he was eleven, his parents sent him to the Protestant Academy at Sedan, where he spent four years studying Greek under Jacques du Rondel. The Protestant Academy of Sedan had been founded in 1579 at the initiative of Françoise de Bourbon, the widow of Henri-Robert de la Marck.

In 1682 the Protestant Academy at Sedan was suppressed, and de Moivre enrolled to study logic at Saumur for two years. Although mathematics was not part of his course work, de Moivre read several works on mathematics on his own, including &quot;Éléments des mathématiques&quot; by the French Oratorian priest and mathematician Jean Prestet and a short treatise on games of chance, &quot;De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae&quot;, by Christiaan Huygens the Dutch physicist, mathematician, astronomer and inventor. In 1684, de Moivre moved to Paris to study physics, and for the first time had formal mathematics training with private lessons from Jacques Ozanam.

Religious persecution in France became severe when King Louis XIV issued the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, which revoked the Edict of Nantes, that had given substantial rights to French Protestants. It forbade Protestant worship and required that all children be baptised by Catholic priests. De Moivre was sent to Prieuré Saint-Martin-des-Champs, a school to which the authorities sent Protestant children for indoctrination into Catholicism.

It is unclear when de Moivre left the Prieuré de Saint-Martin and moved to England, since the records of the Prieuré de Saint-Martin indicate that he left the school in 1688, but de Moivre and his brother presented themselves as Huguenots admitted to the Savoy Church in London on 28 August 1687.

===Middle years===
By the time he arrived in London, de Moivre was a competent mathematician with a good knowledge of many of the standard texts. To make a living, de Moivre became a private tutor of mathematics, visiting his pupils or teaching in the coffee houses of London. De Moivre continued his studies of mathematics after visiting the Earl of Devonshire and seeing Newton&#x27;s recent book, &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. Looking through the book, he realised that it was far deeper than the books that he had studied previously, and he became determined to read and understand it. However, as he was required to take extended walks around London to travel between his students, de Moivre had little time for study, so he tore pages from the book and carried them around in his pocket to read between lessons.

According to a possibly apocryphal story, Newton, in the later years of his life, used to refer people posing mathematical questions to him to de Moivre, saying, &quot;He knows all these things better than I do.&quot;

By 1692, de Moivre became friends with Edmond Halley and soon after with Isaac Newton himself. In 1695, Halley communicated de Moivre&#x27;s first mathematics paper, which arose from his study of fluxions in the &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, to the Royal Society. This paper was published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; that same year. Shortly after publishing this paper, de Moivre also generalised Newton&#x27;s noteworthy binomial theorem into the multinomial theorem. The Royal Society became apprised of this method in 1697, and it elected de Moivre a Fellow on 30 November 1697.

After de Moivre had been accepted, Halley encouraged him to turn his attention to astronomy. In 1705, de Moivre discovered, intuitively, that &quot;the centripetal force of any planet is directly related to its distance from the centre of the forces and reciprocally related to the product of the diameter of the evolute and the cube of the perpendicular on the tangent.&quot; In other words, if a planet, M, follows an elliptical orbit around a focus F and has a point P where PM is tangent to the curve and FPM is a right angle so that FP is the perpendicular to the tangent, then the centripetal force at point P is proportional to FM/(R*(FP)3) where R is the radius of the curvature at M. The mathematician Johann Bernoulli proved this formula in 1710.

Despite these successes, de Moivre was unable to obtain an appointment to a chair of mathematics at any university, which would have released him from his dependence on time-consuming tutoring that burdened him more than it did most other mathematicians of the time. At least a part of the reason was a bias against his French origins.

In November 1697 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1712 was appointed to a commission set up by the society, alongside MM. Arbuthnot, Hill, Halley, Jones, Machin, Burnet, Robarts, Bonet, Aston, and Taylor to review the claims of Newton and Leibniz as to who discovered calculus. The full details of the controversy can be found in the Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy article.

Throughout his life de Moivre remained poor. It is reported that he was a regular customer of old Slaughter&#x27;s Coffee House, St. Martin&#x27;s Lane at Cranbourn Street, where he earned a little money from playing chess.

===Later years===
De Moivre continued studying the fields of probability and mathematics until his death in 1754 and several additional papers were published after his death. As he grew older, he became increasingly lethargic and needed longer sleeping hours. It is a common claim that De Moivre noted he was sleeping an extra 15 minutes each night and correctly calculated the date of his death as the day when the sleep time reached 24 hours, 27 November 1754. On that day he did in fact die, in London and his body was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, although his body was later moved. The claim of him predicting his own death, however, has been disputed as not having been documented anywhere at the time of its occurrence.

==Probability==

De Moivre pioneered the development of analytic geometry and the theory of probability by expanding upon the work of his predecessors, particularly Christiaan Huygens and several members of the Bernoulli family. He also produced the second textbook on probability theory, &quot;The Doctrine of Chances: a method of calculating the probabilities of events in play&quot;. (The first book about games of chance, &quot;Liber de ludo aleae&quot; (&quot;On Casting the Die&quot;), was written by Girolamo Cardano in the 1560s, but it was not published until 1663.) This book came out in four editions, 1711 in Latin, and in English in 1718, 1738, and 1756. In the later editions of his book, de Moivre included his unpublished result of 1733, which is the first statement of an approximation to the binomial distribution in terms of what we now call the normal or Gaussian function. This was the first method of finding the probability of the occurrence of an error of a given size when that error is expressed in terms of the variability of the distribution as a unit, and the first identification of the calculation of probable error. In addition, he applied these theories to gambling problems and actuarial tables.

An expression commonly found in probability is &quot;n&quot;! but before the days of calculators calculating &quot;n&quot;! for a large &quot;n&quot; was time-consuming. In 1733 de Moivre proposed the formula for estimating a factorial as &quot;n&quot;! = &quot;cn&quot;(&quot;n&quot;+1/2)&quot;e&quot;−&quot;n&quot;. He obtained an approximate expression for the constant &quot;c&quot; but it was James Stirling who found that c was .

De Moivre also published an article called &quot;Annuities upon Lives&quot; in which he revealed the normal distribution of the mortality rate over a person&#x27;s age. From this he produced a simple formula for approximating the revenue produced by annual payments based on a person&#x27;s age. This is similar to the types of formulas used by insurance companies today.

===Priority regarding the Poisson distribution===
Some results on the Poisson distribution were first introduced by de Moivre in &quot;De Mensura Sortis seu; de Probabilitate Eventuum in Ludis a Casu Fortuito Pendentibus&quot; in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, p. 219. As a result, some authors have argued that the Poisson distribution should bear the name of de Moivre.

==De Moivre&#x27;s formula==
In 1707, de Moivre derived an equation from which one can deduce:

: formula_1

which he was able to prove for all positive integers &quot;n&quot;. In 1722, he presented equations from which one can deduce the better known form of de Moivre&#x27;s Formula:
: formula_2
In 1749 Euler proved this formula for any real n using Euler&#x27;s formula, which makes the proof quite straightforward. This formula is important because it relates complex numbers and trigonometry. Additionally, this formula allows the derivation of useful expressions for cos(&quot;nx&quot;) and sin(&quot;nx&quot;) in terms of cos(&quot;x&quot;) and sin(&quot;x&quot;).

==Stirling&#x27;s approximation==
De Moivre had been studying probability, and his investigations required him to calculate binomial coefficients, which in turn required him to calculate factorials. In 1730 de Moivre published his book &quot;Miscellanea Analytica de Seriebus et Quadraturis&quot; [Analytic Miscellany of Series and Integrals], which included tables of log (&quot;n&quot;!). For large values of &quot;n&quot;, de Moivre approximated the coefficients of the terms in a binomial expansion. Specifically, given a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is even and large, then the coefficient of the middle term of (1 + 1)&quot;n&quot; is approximated by the equation:

::formula_3

On June 19, 1729, James Stirling sent to de Moivre a letter, which illustrated how he calculated the coefficient of the middle term of a binomial expansion (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;)&quot;n&quot; for large values of &quot;n&quot;. In 1730, Stirling published his book &quot;Methodus Differentialis&quot; [The Differential Method], in which he included his series for log(&quot;n&quot;!):

::formula_4

so that for large formula_5, formula_6.

On November 12, 1733, de Moivre privately published and distributed a pamphlet – &quot;Approximatio ad Summam Terminorum Binomii&quot; (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;)&quot;n&quot; &quot;in Seriem expansi&quot; [Approximation of the Sum of the Terms of the Binomial (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;)&quot;n&quot; expanded into a Series] – in which he acknowledged Stirling&#x27;s letter and proposed an alternative expression for the central term of a binomial expansion.

<text>The Tragedy of Julius Caesar (First Folio title: The Tragedie of Ivlivs Cæsar), often shortened to Julius Caesar, is a history play and tragedy by William Shakespeare first performed in 1599.

In the play, Brutus joins a conspiracy led by Cassius to assassinate Julius Caesar, to prevent him from becoming a tyrant. Caesar&#x27;s right-hand man Antony stirs up hostility against the conspirators and Rome becomes embroiled in a dramatic civil war.

==Synopsis==
The play opens with two tribunes Flavius and Marullus (appointed leaders/officials of Rome) discovering the commoners of Rome celebrating Julius Caesar&#x27;s triumphant return from defeating the sons of his military rival, Pompey. The tribunes, insulting the crowd for their change in loyalty from Pompey to Caesar, attempt to end the festivities and break up the commoners, who return the insults. During the feast of Lupercal, Caesar holds a victory parade and a soothsayer warns him to &quot;Beware the ides of March,&quot; which he ignores. Meanwhile, Cassius attempts to convince Brutus to join his conspiracy to kill Caesar. Although Brutus, friendly towards Caesar, is hesitant to kill him, he agrees that Caesar may be abusing his power. They then hear from Casca that Mark Antony has offered Caesar the crown of Rome three times. Casca tells them that each time Caesar refused it with increasing reluctance, hoping that the crowd watching would insist that he accept the crown. He describes how the crowd applauded Caesar for denying the crown, and how this upset Caesar. On the eve of the ides of March, the conspirators meet and reveal that they have forged letters of support from the Roman people to tempt Brutus into joining. Brutus reads the letters and, after much moral debate, decides to join the conspiracy, thinking that Caesar should be killed to &quot;prevent&quot; him from doing anything against the people of Rome if he were ever to be crowned.

After ignoring the soothsayer, as well as his wife Calpurnia&#x27;s own premonitions, Caesar goes to the Senate. The conspirators approach him with a fake petition pleading on behalf of Metellus Cimber&#x27;s banished brother. As Caesar predictably rejects the petition, Casca and the others suddenly stab him; Brutus is last. At this, Caesar asks &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot; (&quot;And you, Brutus?&quot;), concluding with &quot;Then fall, Caesar!&quot;
The conspirators attempt to demonstrate that they killed Caesar for the good of Rome, to prevent an autocrat. They prove this by not attempting to flee the scene. Brutus delivers an oration defending his actions, and for the moment, the crowd is on his side. However, Antony makes a subtle and eloquent speech over Caesar&#x27;s corpse, beginning &quot;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!&quot; He deftly turns public opinion against the assassins by manipulating the emotions of the common people, in contrast to the rational tone of Brutus&#x27;s speech, yet there is a method in his rhetorical speech and gestures. Antony reminds the crowd of the good Caesar had done for Rome, his sympathy with the poor, and his refusal of the crown at the Lupercal, thus questioning Brutus&#x27;s claim of Caesar&#x27;s ambition; he shows Caesar&#x27;s bloody, lifeless body to the crowd to have them shed tears and gain sympathy for their fallen hero; and he reads Caesar&#x27;s will, in which every Roman citizen would receive 75 drachmas. Antony, even as he states his intentions against it, rouses the mob to drive the conspirators from Rome. The mob takes Caesar&#x27;s body to the Forum, lights his funeral pyre, and uses the pyre to light up torches for burning down the homes of the conspirators. Amid the violence, an innocent poet, Cinna, is confused with the conspirator Lucius Cinna and is taken by the mob, which kills him for such &quot;offences&quot; as his bad verses.

Brutus then attacks Cassius for supposedly soiling the noble act of regicide by having accepted bribes. (&quot;Did not great Julius bleed for justice&#x27; sake? / What villain touched his body, that did stab, / And not for justice?&quot;) The two are reconciled, especially after Brutus reveals that his beloved wife committed suicide under the stress of his absence from Rome; they prepare for a civil war against Antony, Caesar&#x27;s adopted son Octavius, and Lepidus who have formed a triumvirate in Rome. That night, Caesar&#x27;s ghost appears to Brutus with a warning of defeat. (He informs Brutus, &quot;Thou shalt see me at Philippi.&quot;)

At the Battle of Philippi, Cassius and Brutus, knowing that they will probably both die, smile their last smiles to each other and hold hands. During the battle, Cassius has his servant kill him after hearing of the capture of his best friend, Titinius. After Titinius, who was not captured, sees Cassius&#x27;s corpse, he commits suicide. However, Brutus wins that stage of the battle, but his victory is not conclusive. With a heavy heart, Brutus battles again the next day. He asks his friends to kill him, but the friends refuse. He loses and commits suicide by running on his sword, held for him by a loyal soldier.

The play ends with a tribute to Brutus by Antony, who proclaims that Brutus has remained &quot;the noblest Roman of them all&quot; because he was the only conspirator who acted, in his mind, for the good of Rome. There is then a small hint at the friction between Antony and Octavius which characterizes another of Shakespeare&#x27;s Roman plays, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra.&quot;

==Sources==
The main source of the play is Thomas North&#x27;s translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;.

===Deviations from Plutarch===
* Shakespeare makes Caesar&#x27;s triumph take place on the day of Lupercalia (15 February) instead of six months earlier.
* For dramatic effect, he makes the Capitol the venue of Caesar&#x27;s death rather than the &quot;Curia Pompeia&quot; (Curia of Pompey).
* Caesar&#x27;s murder, the funeral, Antony&#x27;s oration, the reading of the will, and the arrival of Octavius all take place on the same day in the play. However, historically, the assassination took place on 15 March (The Ides of March), the will was published on 18 March, the funeral was on 20 March, and Octavius arrived only in May.
* Shakespeare makes the Triumvirs meet in Rome instead of near Bononia to avoid an additional locale.
* He combines the two Battles of Philippi although there was a 20-day interval between them.
* Shakespeare has Caesar say &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot; (&quot;And you, Brutus?&quot;) before he dies. Plutarch and Suetonius each report that he said nothing, with Plutarch adding that he pulled his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators, though Suetonius does record other reports that Caesar said &quot;&quot; (&quot;This is violence&quot;). The Latin words &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot;, however, were not devised by Shakespeare for this play since they are attributed to Caesar in earlier Elizabethan works and had become conventional by 1599.

Shakespeare deviated from these historical facts to curtail time and compress the facts so that the play could be staged more easily. The tragic force is condensed into a few scenes for heightened effect.

==Date and text==

&quot;Julius Caesar&quot; was originally published in the First Folio of 1623, but a performance was mentioned by Thomas Platter the Younger in his diary in September 1599. The play is not mentioned in the list of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays published by Francis Meres in 1598. Based on these two points, as well as several contemporary allusions, and the belief that the play is similar to &quot;Hamlet&quot; in vocabulary, and to &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot; in metre, scholars have suggested 1599 as a probable date.

The text of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in the First Folio is the only authoritative text for the play. The Folio text is notable for its quality and consistency; scholars judge it to have been set into type from a theatrical prompt-book.

The play contains many anachronistic elements from the Elizabethan era. The characters mention objects such as doublets (large, heavy jackets) – which did not exist in ancient Rome. Caesar is mentioned to be wearing an Elizabethan doublet instead of a Roman toga. At one point a clock is heard to strike and Brutus notes it with &quot;Count the clock&quot;.

==Analysis and criticism==

===Historical background===
Maria Wyke has written that the play reflects the general anxiety of Elizabethan England over a succession of leadership. At the time of its creation and first performance, Queen Elizabeth, a strong ruler, was elderly and had refused to name a successor, leading to worries that a civil war similar to that of Rome might break out after her death.

===Protagonist debate===
Critics of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; differ greatly in their views of Caesar and Brutus. Many have debated whether Caesar or Brutus is the protagonist of the play. Intertwined in this debate is a smattering of philosophical and psychological ideologies on republicanism and monarchism. One author, Robert C. Reynolds, devotes attention to the names or epithets given to both Brutus and Caesar in his essay &quot;Ironic Epithet in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;&quot;. He points out that Casca praises Brutus at face value, but then inadvertently compares him to a disreputable joke of a man by calling him an alchemist, &quot;Oh, he sits high in all the people&#x27;s hearts,/And that which would appear offense in us/ His countenance, like richest alchemy,/ Will change to virtue and worthiness&quot; (I.iii.158–160). Reynolds also talks about Caesar and his &quot;Colossus&quot; epithet, which he points out has obvious connotations of power and manliness, but also lesser-known connotations of an outward glorious front and inward chaos.

Myron Taylor, in his essay &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and the Irony of History&quot;, compares the logic and philosophies of Caesar and Brutus. Caesar is deemed an intuitive philosopher who is always right when he goes with his instinct; for instance, when he says he fears Cassius as a threat to him before he is killed, his intuition is correct. Brutus is portrayed as a man similar to Caesar, but whose passions lead him to the wrong reasoning, which he realizes in the end when he says in V.v.50–51, &quot;Caesar, now be still:/ I killed not thee with half so good a will&quot;.

Joseph W. Houppert acknowledges that some critics have tried to cast Caesar as the protagonist, but that ultimately Brutus is the driving force in the play and is, therefore, the tragic hero. Brutus attempts to put the republic over his relationship with Caesar and kills him. Brutus makes the political mistakes that bring down the republic that his ancestors created. He acts on his passions, does not gather enough evidence to make reasonable decisions, and is manipulated by Cassius and the other conspirators.

Traditional readings of the play may maintain that Cassius and the other conspirators are motivated largely by envy and ambition, whereas Brutus is motivated by the demands of honor and patriotism. Certainly, this is the view that Antony expresses in the final scene. But one of the central strengths of the play is that it resists categorizing its characters as either simple heroes or villains. The political journalist and classicist Garry Wills maintains that &quot;This play is distinctive because it has no villains&quot;. It is a drama famous for the difficulty of deciding which role to emphasize. The characters rotate around each other like the plates of a Calder mobile. Touch one and it affects the position of all the others. Raise one, and another sinks. But they keep coming back into a precarious balance.

==Performance history==
The play was probably one of Shakespeare&#x27;s first to be performed at the Globe Theatre. Thomas Platter the Younger, a Swiss traveler, saw a tragedy about Julius Caesar at a Bankside theatre on 21 September 1599, and this was most likely Shakespeare&#x27;s play, as there is no obvious alternative candidate. (While the story of Julius Caesar was dramatized repeatedly in the Elizabethan/Jacobean period, none of the other plays known is as good a match with Platter&#x27;s description as Shakespeare&#x27;s play.)

After the theatres re-opened at the start of the Restoration era, the play was revived by Thomas Killigrew&#x27;s King&#x27;s Company in 1672. Charles Hart initially played Brutus, as did Thomas Betterton in later productions. &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; was one of the very few Shakespeare plays that was not adapted during the Restoration period or the eighteenth century.

===Notable performances===

* 1864: Junius Jr., Edwin and John Wilkes Booth (later the assassin of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln) made the only appearance onstage together in a benefit performance of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; on 25 November 1864, at the Winter Garden Theater in New York City. Junius Jr. played Cassius, Edwin played Brutus and John Wilkes played Mark Antony. This landmark production raised funds to erect a statue of Shakespeare in Central Park, which remains to this day.
* 29 May 1916: A one-night performance in the natural bowl of Beachwood Canyon, Hollywood drew an audience of 40,000 and starred Tyrone Power Sr. and Douglas Fairbanks Sr. The student bodies of Hollywood and Fairfax High Schools played opposing armies, and the elaborate battle scenes were performed on a huge stage as well as the surrounding hillsides. The play commemorated the tercentenary of Shakespeare&#x27;s death. A photograph of the elaborate stage and viewing stands can be seen on the Library of Congress website. The performance was lauded by L. Frank Baum.
* 1926: Another elaborate performance of the play was staged as a benefit for the Actors Fund of America at the Hollywood Bowl. Caesar arrived for the Lupercal in a chariot drawn by four white horses. The stage was the size of a city block and dominated by a central tower in height. The event was mainly aimed at creating work for unemployed actors. Three hundred gladiators appeared in an arena scene not featured in Shakespeare&#x27;s play; a similar number of girls danced as Caesar&#x27;s captives; a total of three thousand soldiers took part in the battle sequences.

* 1937: &quot;Caesar&quot;, Orson Welles&#x27;s famous Mercury Theatre production, drew fevered comment as the director dressed his protagonists in uniforms reminiscent of those common at the time in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, drawing a specific analogy between Caesar and Fascist Italian leader Benito Mussolini. &quot;Time&quot; magazine gave the production a rave review, together with the New York critics. The fulcrum of the show was the slaughter of Cinna the Poet (Norman Lloyd), a scene that stopped the show. &quot;Caesar&quot; opened at the Mercury Theatre in New York City in November 1937 and moved to the larger National Theater in January 1938, running a total of 157 performances. A second company made a five-month national tour with &quot;Caesar&quot; in 1938, again to critical acclaim.
* 1950: John Gielgud played Cassius at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre under the direction of Michael Langham and Anthony Quayle. The production was considered one of the highlights of a remarkable Stratford season and led to Gielgud (who had done little film work to that time) playing Cassius in Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s 1953 film version.
* 1977: Gielgud made his final appearance in a Shakespearean role on stage as Caesar in John Schlesinger&#x27;s production at the Royal National Theatre. The cast also included Ian Charleson as Octavius.
* 1994: Arvind Gaur directed the play in India with Jaimini Kumar as Brutus and Deepak Ochani as Caesar (24 shows); later on he revived it with Manu Rishi as Caesar and Vishnu Prasad as Brutus for the Shakespeare Drama Festival, Assam in 1998. Arvind Kumar translated &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; into Hindi. This production was also performed at the Prithvi international theatre festival, at the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi.
* 2005: Denzel Washington played Brutus in the first Broadway production of the play in over fifty years. The production received universally negative reviews but was a sell-out because of Washington&#x27;s popularity at the box office.
* 2012: The Royal Shakespeare Company staged an all-black production under the direction of Gregory Doran.
* 2012: An all-female production starring Harriet Walter as Brutus and Frances Barber as Caesar was staged at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Phyllida Lloyd. In October 2013, the production transferred to New York&#x27;s St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse in Brooklyn.
* 2018: The Bridge Theatre staged &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; as one of its first productions, under the direction of Nicholas Hytner, with Ben Whishaw, Michelle Fairley, and David Morrissey as leads. This mirrors the play&#x27;s status as one of the first productions at the Globe Theatre in 1599.

==Adaptations and cultural references==

One of the earliest cultural references to the play came in Shakespeare&#x27;s own &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Prince Hamlet asks Polonius about his career as a thespian at university, and Polonius replies: &quot;I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed in the Capitol. Brutus killed me.&quot; This is a likely meta-reference, as Richard Burbage is generally accepted to have played leading men Brutus and Hamlet, and the older John Heminges to have played Caesar and Polonius.

In 1851, the German composer Robert Schumann wrote a concert overture &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Other musical settings include those by Giovanni Bononcini, Hans von Bülow, Felix Draeseke, Josef Bohuslav Foerster, John Ireland, John Foulds, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Manfred Gurlitt, Darius Milhaud, and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.

The Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster parodied &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in their 1958 sketch &quot;Rinse the Blood off My Toga&quot;. Flavius Maximus, Private Roman Eye, is hired by Brutus to investigate the death of Caesar. The police procedural combines Shakespeare, &quot;Dragnet&quot;, and vaudeville jokes and was first broadcast on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

In 1984, the Riverside Shakespeare Company of New York City produced a modern dress &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; set in contemporary Washington, called simply &quot;CAESAR!&quot;, starring Harold Scott as Brutus, Herman Petras as Caesar, Marya Lowry as Portia, Robert Walsh as Antony, and Michael Cook as Cassius, directed by W. Stuart McDowell at The Shakespeare Center.

In 2006, Chris Taylor from the Australian comedy team The Chaser wrote a comedy musical called &quot;Dead Caesar&quot; which was shown at the Sydney Theatre Company in Sydney.

The line &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot;, from the speech made by Mark Antony following Caesar&#x27;s death (&quot;The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones.&quot;) has had many references in media, including the titles of:
* A song by Iron Maiden.
* A politically oriented film directed by J. Lee Thompson in 1984.
* A novel in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; series.

The 2008 movie &quot;Me and Orson Welles&quot;, based on a book of the same name by Robert Kaplow, is a fictional story centered around Orson Welles&#x27; famous 1937 production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; at the Mercury Theatre. British actor Christian McKay is cast as Welles, and co-stars with Zac Efron and Claire Danes.

The 2012 Italian drama film &quot;Caesar Must Die&quot; (), directed by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, follows convicts in their rehearsals ahead of a prison performance of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.

In the Ray Bradbury book &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, some of the character Beatty&#x27;s last words are &quot;There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am armed so strong in honesty that they pass me as an idle wind, which I respect not!&quot;

The play&#x27;s line &quot;the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves&quot;, spoken by Cassius in Act I, scene 2, is often referenced in popular culture. The line gave its name to the J.M. Barrie play &quot;Dear Brutus&quot;, and also gave its name to the best-selling young adult novel &quot;The Fault in Our Stars&quot; by John Green and its film adaptation. The same line was quoted in Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s epilogue of his famous 1954 &quot;See It Now&quot; documentary broadcast concerning Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. This speech and the line were recreated in the 2005 film &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot;. It was also quoted by George Clooney&#x27;s character in the Coen brothers film &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot;.

The line &quot;And therefore think him as a serpent&#x27;s egg / Which hatched, would, as his kind grow mischievous; And kill him in the shell&quot; spoken by Brutus in Act II, Scene 1, is referenced in the Dead Kennedys song &quot;California über alles&quot;.

The title of Agatha Christie&#x27;s novel &quot;Taken at the Flood&quot;, titled &quot;There Is a Tide&quot; in its American edition, refers to an iconic line of Brutus: &quot;There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.&quot; (Act IV, Scene III).

The line &quot;There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures&quot; is recited by Jean-Luc Picard at the end of the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; series finale, &quot;The Last Generation.&quot; The play was previously discussed in a conversation between Julian Bashir and Elim Garak in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Improbable Cause&quot;.

===Film and television adaptations===
&quot;Julius Caesar&quot; has been adapted to a number of film productions, including:
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (Vitagraph Company of America, 1908), produced by J. Stuart Blackton and directed by William V. Ranous, who also played Antony.
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (Avon Productions, 1950), directed by David Bradley, who played Brutus; Charlton Heston played Antony and Harold Tasker played Caesar.
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (MGM, 1953), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and produced by John Houseman; starring James Mason as Brutus, Marlon Brando as Antony and Louis Calhern as Caesar.
* &quot;An Honourable Murder&quot; (1960), directed by Godfrey Grayson; depicted the play in a modern business setting.
* &quot;The Spread of the Eagle&quot;, a 1963 BBC series comprising &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and &quot;Antony &amp; Cleopatra&quot;.
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (BBC, 1969), a television adaptation in the Play of the Month series, directed by Alan Bridges.
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (Commonwealth United, 1969), directed by Stuart Burge, produced by Peter Snell, starring Jason Robards as Brutus, Charlton Heston as Antony and John Gielgud as Caesar.
* &quot;Heil Caesar&quot; (BBC, 1973), a three-part television play written by John Griffith Bowen that was &quot;a modern-dress modern-dialogue rewrite of the play, updated to an unnamed present-day regime that&#x27;s about to switch from democracy to dictatorship unless Brutus and his conspirators act to prevent it.&quot; It was intended as an introduction to Shakespeare&#x27;s play for schoolchildren, but it proved good enough to be shown on adult television, and a stage version was later produced. The British Universities Film &amp; Video Council database states that the work &quot;transforms the play into a modern political conspiracy thriller with modern dialogue and many strong allusions to political events in the early 1970.&quot;
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (BBC/Time-Life TV, 1978), a television adaptation in the BBC Television Shakespeare series, directed by Herbert Wise and produced by Cedric Messina, starring Richard Pasco as Brutus, Keith Michell as Antony and Charles Gray as Caesar.
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (2010), is a short film starring Randy Harrison as Brutus and John Shea as Julius Caesar. Directed by Patrick J Donnelly and produced by Dan O&#x27;Hare.
* &quot;Caesar Must Die&quot; (2012), is an Italian film about a group of prison inmates rehearsing a play. Ultimately, the prison life and the play become indistinguishable and Mark Antony&#x27;s Friends, Romans... speech is delivered in a prison courtyard with hundreds of prisoners peeking from their cell windows taking the role of Roman citizens. While the film is fictional, the actors are actual prison inmates playing themselves.
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (2012), a BBC television film adaptation of the Royal Shakespeare Company stage production of the same year directed by Gregory Doran with an all-Black cast, sets the tragedy in post-independence Africa with echoes of the Arab Spring. The film stars Paterson Joseph as Brutus, Ray Fearon as Antony, Jeffery Kissoon as Caesar, Cyril Nri as Cassius and Adjoa Andoh as Portia.
* &quot;Zulfiqar&quot; (2016), a Bengali-language Indian film by Srijit Mukherji that is an adaptation of both &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and a tribute to the film &quot;The Godfather&quot;.

===Contemporary political references===
Modern adaptions of the play have often made contemporary political references, with Caesar depicted as resembling a variety of political leaders, including Huey Long, Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair, as well as Fidel Castro and Oliver North. Scholar A. J. Hartley stated that this is a fairly &quot;common trope&quot; of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; performances: &quot;Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, the rule has been to create a recognizable political world within the production. And often people in the title role itself look like or feel like somebody either in recent or current politics.&quot; A 2012 production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; by the Guthrie Theater and The Acting Company &quot;presented Caesar in the guise of a black actor who was meant to suggest President Obama.&quot; This production was not particularly controversial.

In 2017, however, a modern adaptation of the play at New York&#x27;s Shakespeare in the Park (performed by The Public Theater) depicted Caesar with the likeness of then-president Donald Trump and thereby aroused ferocious controversy, drawing criticism by media outlets such as &quot;The Daily Caller&quot; and &quot;Breitbart&quot; and prompting corporate sponsors Bank of America and Delta Air Lines to pull their financial support. The Public Theater stated that the message of the play is not pro-assassination and that the point is that &quot;those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save.&quot; Shakespeare scholars Stephen Greenblatt and Peter Holland agreed with this statement. Pallotta stated that &quot;I have never read anyone suggesting that &#x27;Julius Caesar&#x27; is a play that recommends assassination. Look what happens: Caesar is assassinated to stop him from becoming a dictator. Result: civil war, massive slaughter, creation of an emperor, execution of many who sympathized with the conspiracy. Doesn&#x27;t look much like a successful result for the conspirators to me.&quot; The play was interrupted several times by right-wing protesters, who accused the play of &quot;violence against the right&quot;, and actors and members of theatres with Shakespeare in the name were harassed and received death threats, including the wife of the play&#x27;s director Oskar Eustis. The protests were praised by American Family Association director Sandy Rios who compared the play with the execution of Christians by damnatio ad bestias.

The 2018 Bridge Theatre production also incorporates modern political imagery. The commoners in the first scene sing modern punk music and Caesar distributes red hats to the audience that are remarkably similar to Donald Trump&#x27;s campaign merchandise. The conspirators also use modern firearms during the assassination and the Battle of Phillipi.

<text>In vertebrates, the circulatory system is a system of organs that includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood which is circulated throughout the body. It includes the cardiovascular system, or vascular system, that consists of the heart and blood vessels (from Greek meaning &quot;heart&quot;, and Latin meaning &quot;vessels&quot;). The circulatory system has two divisions, a systemic circulation or circuit, and a pulmonary circulation or circuit. Some sources use the terms &quot;cardiovascular system&quot; and &quot;vascular system&quot; interchangeably with &quot;circulatory system&quot;.

The network of blood vessels are the great vessels of the heart including large elastic arteries, and large veins; other arteries, smaller arterioles, capillaries that join with venules (small veins), and other veins. The circulatory system is closed in vertebrates, which means that the blood never leaves the network of blood vessels. Many invertebrates such as arthropods have an open circulatory system with a heart that pumps a hemolymph which returns via the body cavity rather than via blood vessels. Diploblasts such as sponges and comb jellies lack a circulatory system.

Blood is a fluid consisting of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; it is circulated around the body carrying oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and collecting and disposing of waste materials. Circulated nutrients include proteins and minerals and other components include hemoglobin, hormones, and gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. These substances provide nourishment, help the immune system to fight diseases, and help maintain homeostasis by stabilizing temperature and natural pH.

In vertebrates, the lymphatic system is complementary to the circulatory system. The lymphatic system carries excess plasma (filtered from the circulatory system capillaries as interstitial fluid between cells) away from the body tissues via accessory routes that return excess fluid back to blood circulation as lymph. The lymphatic system is a subsystem that is essential for the functioning of the blood circulatory system; without it the blood would become depleted of fluid.

The lymphatic system also works with the immune system. The circulation of lymph takes much longer than that of blood and, unlike the closed (blood) circulatory system, the lymphatic system is an open system. Some sources describe it as a &quot;secondary circulatory system&quot;.

The circulatory system can be affected by many cardiovascular diseases. Cardiologists are medical professionals which specialise in the heart, and cardiothoracic surgeons specialise in operating on the heart and its surrounding areas. Vascular surgeons focus on disorders of the blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels.

==Structure==
The circulatory system includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The cardiovascular system in all vertebrates, consists of the heart and blood vessels. The circulatory system is further divided into two major circuits – a pulmonary circulation, and a systemic circulation. The pulmonary circulation is a circuit loop from the right heart taking deoxygenated blood to the lungs where it is oxygenated and returned to the left heart. The systemic circulation is a circuit loop that delivers oxygenated blood from the left heart to the rest of the body, and returns deoxygenated blood back to the right heart via large veins known as the venae cavae. The systemic circulation can also be defined as two parts – a &quot;macrocirculation&quot; and a &quot;microcirculation&quot;. An average adult contains five to six quarts (roughly 4.7 to 5.7 liters) of blood, accounting for approximately 7% of their total body weight. Blood consists of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The digestive system also works with the circulatory system to provide the nutrients the system needs to keep the heart pumping.

Further circulatory routes are associated, such as the coronary circulation to the heart itself, the cerebral circulation to the brain, renal circulation to the kidneys, and bronchial circulation to the bronchi in the lungs.
The human circulatory system is closed, meaning that the blood is contained within the vascular network. Nutrients travel through tiny blood vessels of the microcirculation to reach organs. The lymphatic system is an essential subsystem of the circulatory system consisting of a network of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, organs, tissues and circulating lymph. This subsystem is an open system. A major function is to carry the lymph, draining and returning interstitial fluid into the lymphatic ducts back to the heart for return to the circulatory system. Another major function is working together with the immune system to provide defense against pathogens.

===Heart===
The heart pumps blood to all parts of the body providing nutrients and oxygen to every cell, and removing waste products. The left heart pumps oxygenated blood returned from the lungs to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. The right heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs in the pulmonary circulation. In the human heart there is one atrium and one ventricle for each circulation, and with both a systemic and a pulmonary circulation there are four chambers in total: left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium and right ventricle. The right atrium is the upper chamber of the right side of the heart. The blood that is returned to the right atrium is deoxygenated (poor in oxygen) and passed into the right ventricle to be pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs for re-oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. The left atrium receives newly oxygenated blood from the lungs as well as the pulmonary vein which is passed into the strong left ventricle to be pumped through the aorta to the different organs of the body.

====Pulmonary circulation====
The pulmonary circulation is the part of the circulatory system in which oxygen-depleted blood is pumped away from the heart, via the pulmonary artery, to the lungs and returned, oxygenated, to the heart via the pulmonary vein.

Oxygen-deprived blood from the superior and inferior vena cava enters the right atrium of the heart and flows through the tricuspid valve (right atrioventricular valve) into the right ventricle, from which it is then pumped through the pulmonary semilunar valve into the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Gas exchange occurs in the lungs, whereby is released from the blood, and oxygen is absorbed. The pulmonary vein returns the now oxygen-rich blood to the left atrium.

A separate circuit from the systemic circulation, the bronchial circulation supplies blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung.

====Systemic circulation====

The systemic circulation is a circuit loop that delivers oxygenated blood from the left heart to the rest of the body through the aorta. Deoxygenated blood is returned in the systemic circulation to the right heart via two large veins, the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava, where it is pumped from the right atrium into the pulmonary circulation for oxygenation. The systemic circulation can also be defined as having two parts – a macrocirculation and a microcirculation.

===Blood vessels===
The blood vessels of the circulatory system are the arteries, veins, and capillaries. The large arteries and veins that take blood to, and away from the heart are known as the great vessels.

====Arteries====

Oxygenated blood enters the systemic circulation when leaving the left ventricle, via the aortic semilunar valve. The first part of the systemic circulation is the aorta, a massive and thick-walled artery. The aorta arches and gives branches supplying the upper part of the body after passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm at the level of thoracic ten vertebra, it enters the abdomen. Later, it descends down and supplies branches to abdomen, pelvis, perineum and the lower limbs.

The walls of the aorta are elastic. This elasticity helps to maintain the blood pressure throughout the body. When the aorta receives almost five litres of blood from the heart, it recoils and is responsible for pulsating blood pressure. As the aorta branches into smaller arteries, their elasticity goes on decreasing and their compliance goes on increasing.

====Capillaries====
Arteries branch into small passages called arterioles and then into the capillaries. The capillaries merge to bring blood into the venous system. The total length of muscle capillaries in a 70 kg human is estimated to be between 9,000 and 19,000 km.

====Veins====

Capillaries merge into venules, which merge into veins. The venous system feeds into the two major veins: the superior vena cava – which mainly drains tissues above the heart – and the inferior vena cava – which mainly drains tissues below the heart. These two large veins empty into the right atrium of the heart.

====Portal veins====
The general rule is that arteries from the heart branch out into capillaries, which collect into veins leading back to the heart. Portal veins are a slight exception to this. In humans, the only significant example is the hepatic portal vein which combines from capillaries around the gastrointestinal tract where the blood absorbs the various products of digestion; rather than leading directly back to the heart, the hepatic portal vein branches into a second capillary system in the liver.

====Coronary circulation====

The heart itself is supplied with oxygen and nutrients through a small &quot;loop&quot; of the systemic circulation and derives very little from the blood contained within the four chambers.
The coronary circulation system provides a blood supply to the heart muscle itself. The coronary circulation begins near the origin of the aorta by two coronary arteries: the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery. After nourishing the heart muscle, blood returns through the coronary veins into the coronary sinus and from this one into the right atrium. Backflow of blood through its opening during atrial systole is prevented by the Thebesian valve. The smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the heart chambers.

====Cerebral circulation====

The brain has a dual blood supply, an &quot;anterior&quot; and a &quot;posterior circulation&quot; from arteries at its front and back. The anterior circulation arises from the internal carotid arteries to supply the front of the brain. The posterior circulation arises from the vertebral arteries, to supply the back of the brain and brainstem. The circulation from the front and the back join (anastomise) at the circle of Willis. The neurovascular unit, composed of various cells and vasculature channels within the brain, regulates the flow of blood to activated neurons in order to satisfy their high energy demands.

====Renal circulation====
The renal circulation is the blood supply to the kidneys, contains many specialized blood vessels and receives around 20% of the cardiac output. It branches from the abdominal aorta and returns blood to the ascending inferior vena cava.

The development of the circulatory system starts with vasculogenesis in the embryo. The human arterial and venous systems develop from different areas in the embryo. The arterial system develops mainly from the aortic arches, six pairs of arches that develop on the upper part of the embryo. The venous system arises from three bilateral veins during weeks 4 – 8 of embryogenesis. Fetal circulation begins within the 8th week of development. Fetal circulation does not include the lungs, which are bypassed via the truncus arteriosus. Before birth the fetus obtains oxygen (and nutrients) from the mother through the placenta and the umbilical cord.

===Arteries===

The human arterial system originates from the aortic arches and from the dorsal aortae starting from week 4 of embryonic life. The first and second aortic arches regress and form only the maxillary arteries and stapedial arteries respectively. The arterial system itself arises from aortic arches 3, 4 and 6 (aortic arch 5 completely regresses).

The dorsal aortae, present on the dorsal side of the embryo, are initially present on both sides of the embryo. They later fuse to form the basis for the aorta itself. Approximately thirty smaller arteries branch from this at the back and sides. These branches form the intercostal arteries, arteries of the arms and legs, lumbar arteries and the lateral sacral arteries. Branches to the sides of the aorta will form the definitive renal, suprarenal and gonadal arteries. Finally, branches at the front of the aorta consist of the vitelline arteries and umbilical arteries. The vitelline arteries form the celiac, superior and inferior mesenteric arteries of the gastrointestinal tract. After birth, the umbilical arteries will form the internal iliac arteries.

===Veins===

The human venous system develops mainly from the vitelline veins, the umbilical veins and the cardinal veins, all of which empty into the sinus venosus.

==Function==

About 98.5% of the oxygen in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human, breathing air at sea-level pressure, is chemically combined with hemoglobin molecules. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in vertebrates.

==Clinical significance==
Many diseases affect the circulatory system. These include a number of cardiovascular diseases, affecting the heart and blood vessels; hematologic diseases that affect the blood, such as anemia, and lymphatic diseases affecting the lymphatic system. Cardiologists are medical professionals which specialise in the heart, and cardiothoracic surgeons specialise in operating on the heart and its surrounding areas. Vascular surgeons focus on the blood vessels.

===Cardiovascular disease===

Diseases affecting the cardiovascular system are called &quot;cardiovascular disease&quot;.

Many of these diseases are called &quot;lifestyle diseases&quot; because they develop over time and are related to a person&#x27;s exercise habits, diet, whether they smoke, and other lifestyle choices a person makes. Atherosclerosis is the precursor to many of these diseases. It is where small atheromatous plaques build up in the walls of medium and large arteries. This may eventually grow or rupture to occlude the arteries. It is also a risk factor for acute coronary syndromes, which are diseases that are characterised by a sudden deficit of oxygenated blood to the heart tissue. Atherosclerosis is also associated with problems such as aneurysm formation or splitting (&quot;dissection&quot;) of arteries.

Another major cardiovascular disease involves the creation of a clot, called a &quot;thrombus&quot;. These can originate in veins or arteries. Deep venous thrombosis, which mostly occurs in the legs, is one cause of clots in the veins of the legs, particularly when a person has been stationary for a long time. These clots may embolise, meaning travel to another location in the body. The results of this may include pulmonary embolus, transient ischaemic attacks, or stroke.

Cardiovascular diseases may also be congenital in nature, such as heart defects or persistent fetal circulation, where the circulatory changes that are supposed to happen after birth do not. Not all congenital changes to the circulatory system are associated with diseases, a large number are anatomical variations.

===Investigations===

The function and health of the circulatory system and its parts are measured in a variety of manual and automated ways. These include simple methods such as those that are part of the cardiovascular examination, including the taking of a person&#x27;s pulse as an indicator of a person&#x27;s heart rate, the taking of blood pressure through a sphygmomanometer or the use of a stethoscope to listen to the heart for murmurs which may indicate problems with the heart&#x27;s valves. An electrocardiogram can also be used to evaluate the way in which electricity is conducted through the heart.

Other more invasive means can also be used. A cannula or catheter inserted into an artery may be used to measure pulse pressure or pulmonary wedge pressures. Angiography, which involves injecting a dye into an artery to visualise an arterial tree, can be used in the heart (coronary angiography) or brain. At the same time as the arteries are visualised, blockages or narrowings may be fixed through the insertion of stents, and active bleeds may be managed by the insertion of coils. An MRI may be used to image arteries, called an MRI angiogram. For evaluation of the blood supply to the lungs a CT pulmonary angiogram may be used. Vascular ultrasonography may be used to investigate vascular diseases affecting the venous system and the arterial system including the diagnosis of stenosis, thrombosis or venous insufficiency. An intravascular ultrasound using a catheter is also an option.

===Surgery===

There are a number of surgical procedures performed on the circulatory system:
* Coronary artery bypass surgery
* Coronary stent used in angioplasty
* Vascular surgery
* Vein stripping
* Cosmetic procedures

Cardiovascular procedures are more likely to be performed in an inpatient setting than in an ambulatory care setting; in the United States, only 28% of cardiovascular surgeries were performed in the ambulatory care setting.

==Other animals==

While humans, as well as other vertebrates, have a closed blood circulatory system (meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries, veins and capillaries), some invertebrate groups have an open circulatory system containing a heart but limited blood vessels. The most primitive, diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems.

An additional transport system, the lymphatic system, which is only found in animals with a closed blood circulation, is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood.

The blood vascular system first appeared probably in an ancestor of the triploblasts over 600 million years ago, overcoming the time-distance constraints of diffusion, while endothelium evolved in an ancestral vertebrate some 540–510 million years ago.

===Open circulatory system===

In arthropods, the open circulatory system is a system in which a fluid in a cavity called the hemocoel or haemocoel bathes the organs directly with oxygen and nutrients, with there being no distinction between blood and interstitial fluid; this combined fluid is called hemolymph or haemolymph. Muscular movements by the animal during locomotion can facilitate hemolymph movement, but diverting flow from one area to another is limited. When the heart relaxes, blood is drawn back toward the heart through open-ended pores (ostia).

Hemolymph fills all of the interior hemocoel of the body and surrounds all cells. Hemolymph is composed of water, inorganic salts (mostly sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium, and calcium), and organic compounds (mostly carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). The primary oxygen transporter molecule is hemocyanin.

There are free-floating cells, the hemocytes, within the hemolymph. They play a role in the arthropod immune system.

===Closed circulatory system===

The circulatory systems of all vertebrates, as well as of annelids (for example, earthworms) and cephalopods (squids, octopuses and relatives) always keep their circulating blood enclosed within heart chambers or blood vessels and are classified as &quot;closed&quot;, just as in humans. Still, the systems of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds show various stages of the evolution of the circulatory system. Closed systems permit blood to be directed to the organs that require it.

In fish, the system has only one circuit, with the blood being pumped through the capillaries of the gills and on to the capillaries of the body tissues. This is known as &quot;single cycle&quot; circulation. The heart of fish is, therefore, only a single pump (consisting of two chambers).

In amphibians and most reptiles, a double circulatory system is used, but the heart is not always completely separated into two pumps. Amphibians have a three-chambered heart.

In reptiles, the ventricular septum of the heart is incomplete and the pulmonary artery is equipped with a sphincter muscle. This allows a second possible route of blood flow. Instead of blood flowing through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, the sphincter may be contracted to divert this blood flow through the incomplete ventricular septum into the left ventricle and out through the aorta. This means the blood flows from the capillaries to the heart and back to the capillaries instead of to the lungs. This process is useful to ectothermic (cold-blooded) animals in the regulation of their body temperature.

Mammals, birds and crocodilians show complete separation of the heart into two pumps, for a total of four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of birds and crocodilians evolved independently from that of mammals. Double circulatory systems permit blood to be repressurized after returning from the lungs, speeding up delivery of oxygen to tissues.

===No circulatory system===
Circulatory systems are absent in some animals, including flatworms. Their body cavity has no lining or enclosed fluid. Instead, a muscular pharynx leads to an extensively branched digestive system that facilitates direct diffusion of nutrients to all cells. The flatworm&#x27;s dorso-ventrally flattened body shape also restricts the distance of any cell from the digestive system or the exterior of the organism. Oxygen can diffuse from the surrounding water into the cells, and carbon dioxide can diffuse out. Consequently, every cell is able to obtain nutrients, water and oxygen without the need of a transport system.

Some animals, such as jellyfish, have more extensive branching from their gastrovascular cavity (which functions as both a place of digestion and a form of circulation), this branching allows for bodily fluids to reach the outer layers, since the digestion begins in the inner layers.

==History==

The earliest known writings on the circulatory system are found in the Ebers Papyrus (16th century BCE), an ancient Egyptian medical papyrus containing over 700 prescriptions and remedies, both physical and spiritual. In the papyrus, it acknowledges the connection of the heart to the arteries. The Egyptians thought air came in through the mouth and into the lungs and heart. From the heart, the air travelled to every member through the arteries. Although this concept of the circulatory system is only partially correct, it represents one of the earliest accounts of scientific thought.

In the 6th century BCE, the knowledge of circulation of vital fluids through the body was known to the Ayurvedic physician Sushruta in ancient India. He also seems to have possessed knowledge of the arteries, described as &#x27;channels&#x27; by Dwivedi &amp; Dwivedi (2007). The first major ancient Greek research into the circulatory system was completed by Plato in the &quot;Timaeus&quot;, who argues that blood circulates around the body in accordance with the general rules that govern the motions of the elements in the body; accordingly, he does not place much importance in the heart itself. The valves of the heart were discovered by a physician of the Hippocratic school around the early 3rd century BC. However, their function was not properly understood then. Because blood pools in the veins after death, arteries look empty. Ancient anatomists assumed they were filled with air and that they were for the transport of air.

The Greek physician, Herophilus, distinguished veins from arteries but thought that the pulse was a property of arteries themselves. Greek anatomist Erasistratus observed that arteries that were cut during life bleed. He ascribed the fact to the phenomenon that air escaping from an artery is replaced with blood that enters between veins and arteries by very small vessels. Thus he apparently postulated capillaries but with reversed flow of blood.

In 2nd-century AD Rome, the Greek physician Galen knew that blood vessels carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Growth and energy were derived from venous blood created in the liver from chyle, while arterial blood gave vitality by containing pneuma (air) and originated in the heart. Blood flowed from both creating organs to all parts of the body where it was consumed and there was no return of blood to the heart or liver. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart&#x27;s motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Galen believed that the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right by passing through &#x27;pores&#x27; in the interventricular septum, air passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart. As the arterial blood was created &#x27;sooty&#x27; vapors were created and passed to the lungs also via the pulmonary artery to be exhaled.

In 1025, &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; by the Persian physician, Avicenna, &quot;erroneously accepted the Greek notion regarding the existence of a hole in the ventricular septum by which the blood traveled between the ventricles.&quot; Despite this, Avicenna &quot;correctly wrote on the cardiac cycles and valvular function&quot;, and &quot;had a vision of blood circulation&quot; in his &quot;Treatise on Pulse&quot;. While also refining Galen&#x27;s erroneous theory of the pulse, Avicenna provided the first correct explanation of pulsation: &quot;Every beat of the pulse comprises two movements and two pauses. Thus, expansion : pause : contraction : pause. [...] The pulse is a movement in the heart and arteries ... which takes the form of alternate expansion and contraction.&quot;

In 1242, the Arabian physician, Ibn al-Nafis described the process of pulmonary circulation in greater, more accurate detail than his predecessors, though he believed, as they did, in the notion of vital spirit (pneuma), which he believed was formed in the left ventricle. Ibn al-Nafis stated in his &quot;Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna&#x27;s Canon&quot;:

...the blood from the right chamber of the heart must arrive at the left chamber but there is no direct pathway between them. The thick septum of the heart is not perforated and does not have visible pores as some people thought or invisible pores as Galen thought. The blood from the right chamber must flow through the vena arteriosa (pulmonary artery) to the lungs, spread through its substances, be mingled there with air, pass through the arteria venosa (pulmonary vein) to reach the left chamber of the heart and there form the vital spirit...

In addition, Ibn al-Nafis had an insight into what later became a larger theory of the capillary circulation. He stated that &quot;there must be small communications or pores (&quot;manafidh&quot; in Arabic) between the pulmonary artery and vein,&quot; a prediction that preceded the discovery of the capillary system by more than 400 years. Ibn al-Nafis&#x27; theory was confined to blood transit in the lungs and did not extend to the entire body.

Michael Servetus was the first European to describe the function of pulmonary circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. He firstly described it in the &quot;Manuscript of Paris&quot; (near 1546), but this work was never published. And later he published this description, but in a theological treatise, &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot;, not in a book on medicine. Only three copies of the book survived but these remained hidden for decades, the rest were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.

A better known discovery of pulmonary circulation was by Vesalius&#x27;s successor at Padua, Realdo Colombo, in 1559.

Finally, the English physician William Harvey, a pupil of Hieronymus Fabricius (who had earlier described the valves of the veins without recognizing their function), performed a sequence of experiments and published his &quot;Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus&quot; in 1628, which &quot;demonstrated that there had to be a direct connection between the venous and arterial systems throughout the body, and not just the lungs. Most importantly, he argued that the beat of the heart produced a continuous circulation of blood through minute connections at the extremities of the body. This is a conceptual leap that was quite different from Ibn al-Nafis&#x27; refinement of the anatomy and bloodflow in the heart and lungs.&quot; This work, with its essentially correct exposition, slowly convinced the medical world. However, Harvey did not identify the capillary system connecting arteries and veins; this was discovered by Marcello Malpighi in 1661.

<text>The microwave auditory effect, also known as the microwave hearing effect or the Frey effect, consists of the human perception of sounds induced by pulsed or modulated radio frequencies. The perceived sounds are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of radar transponders during World War II. In 1961, the American neuroscientist Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish information on the nature of the microwave auditory effect. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of the auditory apparatus, although competing theories explain the results of holographic interferometry tests differently.

==Research in the U.S.==
Allan H. Frey was the first American to publish on the microwave auditory effect (MAE). Frey&#x27;s &quot;Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy&quot; appeared in the &quot;Journal of Applied Physiology&quot; in 1961. In his experiments, the subjects were discovered to be able to hear appropriately pulsed microwave radiation, from a distance of a few inches to hundreds of feet from the transmitter. In Frey&#x27;s tests, a repetition rate of 50 Hz was used, with pulse width between 10–70 microseconds. The perceived loudness was found to be linked to the peak power density, instead of average power density. At 1.245 GHz, the peak power density for perception was below 80 mW/cm2. According to Frey, the induced sounds were described as &quot;a buzz, clicking, hiss, or knocking, depending on several transmitter parameters, i.e., pulse width and pulse-repetition rate&quot;. By changing transmitter parameters, Frey was able to induce the &quot;perception of severe buffeting of the head, without such apparent vestibular symptoms as dizziness or nausea&quot;. Other transmitter parameters induced a pins and needles sensation. Frey experimented with nerve-deaf subjects, and speculated that the human detecting mechanism was in the cochlea, but at the time of the experiment the results were inconclusive due to factors such as tinnitus.

Auditory sensations of clicking or buzzing have been reported by some workers at modern-day microwave transmitting sites that emit pulsed microwave radiation. Auditory responses to transmitted frequencies from approximately 200 MHz to at least 3 GHz have been reported. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of auditory apparatus, and the generally accepted mechanism is rapid (but minuscule, in the range of 10−5 °C) heating of brain by each pulse, and the resulting pressure wave traveling through the skull to the cochlea.

In 1975, an article by neuropsychologist Don Justesen discussing radiation effects on human perception referred to an experiment by Joseph C. Sharp and Mark Grove at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research during which Sharp and Grove reportedly were able to recognize nine out of ten words transmitted by &quot;voice modulated microwaves&quot;. Although it&#x27;s been reported that &quot;power levels required for transmitting sound... [would cause] brain damage due to... thermal effects&quot; the pops associated with the microwave audio effect are not sustained over time, and the effect is due to brief, sudden, increases in temperature. So while threshold levels of for the microwave audio effect of 267mW/cm² for 1.3GHz and 5000mW/cm² 2.9GHz, respectively, were reported by Frey in 1961, for the peak amplitude (providing the pops) and would only give an average (sustained) power density of only 0.4mW/cm² and 2mW/cm² respectively similar to current cellphones. However, it&#x27;s been argued that despite waves the microwave auditory effect only constituting a rapid 10−6 °C rise in temperature, for threshold peaks on each pulse, that, at the least, a strong peak of around 1400 kW/cm² (1.4 billion mW/cm²) would certainly be harmful due to the resulting pressure wave.

==Electronic warfare==

In 2003–04, WaveBand Corp. had a contract from the U.S. Navy for the design of an MAE system they called MEDUSA (Mob Excess Deterrent Using Silent Audio) that was intended to temporarily incapacitate personnel through remote application. Reportedly, Sierra Nevada Corp. took over the contract from WaveBand. Experts, such as Kenneth Foster, a University of Pennsylvania bioengineering professor who published research on the microwave auditory effect in 1974, have discounted the effectiveness of the proposed device. Foster said that because of human biophysics, the device &quot;would kill you well before you were bothered by the noise&quot;. According to former professor at the University of Washington Bill Guy, &quot;There&#x27;s a misunderstanding by the public and even some scientists about this auditory effect,&quot; and &quot;there couldn&#x27;t possibly be a hazard from the sound, because the heat would get you first&quot;. 

Microwave effects have been proposed as the cause of otherwise unexplained illnesses of U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China occurring since 2017 and 2018. However, this explanation has been debated. Bioengineer Kenneth R. Foster noted of the health effects observed in the diplomats, &quot;it&#x27;s crazy, but it&#x27;s sure as heck not microwaves.&quot; As of October 2021, a microwave cause remains one of the major hypotheses.

==Conspiracy theories==
Numerous individuals suffering from auditory hallucinations, delusional disorders, or other mental illnesses have claimed that government agents use forms of mind control technologies based on microwave signals to transmit sounds and thoughts into their heads as a form of electronic harassment, referring to the alleged technology as &quot;voice to skull&quot; or &quot;V2K&quot;.

There are extensive online support networks and numerous websites operated by people fearing mind control. Mental health professionals maintain that many of these websites exhibit evidence of delusional disorders, although they are divided over whether such sites reinforce mental troubles, or act as a form of group social support.

Psychologists have identified many examples of people reporting &#x27;mind control experiences&#x27; (MCEs) on self-published web pages that are &quot;highly likely to be influenced by delusional beliefs&quot;. Common themes include &quot;Bad Guys&quot; using &quot;psychotronics&quot; and &quot;microwaves&quot;, frequent mention of the CIA&#x27;s MKULTRA project, and frequent citing of Frey&#x27;s 1962 paper entitled &quot;Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy&quot;.

<text>Walter David Jones CH (1 November 1895 – 28 October 1974) was a British painter and modernist poet. As a painter he worked mainly in watercolour on portraits and animal, landscape, legendary and religious subjects. He was also a wood-engraver and inscription painter. In 1965, Kenneth Clark took him to be the best living British painter, while both T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden put his poetry among the best written in their century. Jones&#x27;s work gains form from his Christian faith and Welsh heritage.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jones was born at Arabin Road, Brockley, Kent, now a suburb of South East London, and later lived in nearby Howson Road. His father, James Jones, was born in Flintshire in north Wales, to a Welsh-speaking family, but he was discouraged from speaking Welsh by his father, who believed that habitual use of the language might hold his child back in a career. James Jones moved to London to work as a printer&#x27;s overseer for the &quot;Christian Herald&quot; Press. He met and married Alice Bradshaw, a Londoner, and they had three children: Harold, who died at 21 of tuberculosis, Alice and David.

Jones exhibited artistic promise at an early age, even entering drawings for exhibitions of children&#x27;s artwork. He wrote that he knew from the age of six he would devote his life to art. He did not read fluently until the age of eight. By nine years of age, he identified with his father&#x27;s Welsh background and dropped his Anglo-Saxon first name Walter. In 1909, at 14, he entered Camberwell Art School, where he studied under A. S. Hartrick, who had worked with Van Gogh and Gauguin and introduced him to the work of the Impressionists and Pre-Raphaelites. In addition, Jones studied literature, the subject of a mandatory one-hour weekly class at Camberwell.

===World War I===
With the outbreak of the First World War, Jones enlisted in the London Welsh Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 2 January 1915 and served on the Western Front in 1915–1918 with the 38th (Welsh) Division. Jones spent more time on the front line (117 weeks) than any other British writer in the war. He was wounded at Mametz Wood, recuperated in the Midlands, was returned to the Ypres Salient, and joined in the attack on Pilckem Ridge at Passchendaele in 1917. He nearly died of trench fever in 1918, but recovered in England and was stationed in Ireland until the armistice of 11 November 1918. Jones&#x27;s wartime experience was the basis for his long poem &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;.

===1920s===
In 1919 Jones won a government grant to return at Camberwell Art School. From Camberwell, he followed Walter Bayes to the Westminster School of Art in central London, where he studied under him and with Bernard Meninsky, and was influenced by Walter Sickert, an occasional lecturer there, whom he came to know personally. Jones received instruction towards becoming a Catholic from Fr. John O&#x27;Connor, who suggested Jones visit Eric Gill and his guild of Catholic craftsmen at Ditchling in Sussex. Influenced by Gill, Jones entered the Catholic Church in 1921, chiefly, he said, because it seemed &quot;real&quot; in contrast to Christian alternatives. He also liked the Church&#x27;s continuity with Classical antiquity. In 1922 he increasingly spent time at Ditchling, apprenticed as a carpenter but never becoming a full member of Gill&#x27;s Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic. Having shown himself an incompetent carpenter, Jones turned to wood-engraving, whose rudiments Desmond Chute had taught him. In 1923 Jones worked as an illustrator, for &quot;The Game&quot; published by Gill and Hilary Pepler. He also engraved original work for Pepler&#x27;s St. Dominic&#x27;s Press, including &quot;The Rosary Book&quot;. When Gill moved to Capel-y-ffin in the Black Mountains of South Wales in 1923, Jones returned to London, but often visited Gill there and also the Benedictines on Caldey Island, near Tenby.

Jones was among the first modern engravers to combine white-line and black-line engraving. In 1927 he joined the Society of Wood Engravers. He illustrated &quot;The Book of Jonah&quot;, &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables.&quot; and, for the Golden Cockerel Press, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and engraved a large, elaborate frontispiece for a Welsh translation of the Book of Ecclesiastes, &quot;Llyfr y Pregethwr&quot;. Subsequently Robert Gibbings commissioned him to illustrate, with eight large wood engravings, &quot;The Chester Play of the Deluge&quot; (1927), and Douglas Cleverdon commissioned him to illustrate, with eight large copper engravings, Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (1929). In 1930 eye-strain forced him to give up engraving.

In 1924 Jones had become engaged to marry Gill&#x27;s daughter Petra, but in 1927 she broke off the engagement to marry a mutual friend. Distressed, Jones concentrated on art. Petra&#x27;s long neck and high forehead continued as female features in his artwork. He returned to live with his parents at Brockley, also spending time at a house they rented on the coast at Portslade. He painted prolifically and exhibited watercolour seascapes and Welsh landscapes in London galleries. In 1927 Jones made friends with Jim Ede, at the Tate Gallery, who introduced him to art critics and prospective buyers, including Helen Sutherland, who became a patron. Ede introduced him to the painter Ben Nicholson, who in 1928 had Jones elected to the Seven and Five Society, whose other members included Barbara Hepworth, Winifred Nicholson, Cedric Morris, Christopher Wood, and Henry Moore. Jones remained a member until 1935, when he was expelled by Nicholson for not painting abstracts. Disappointed by published accounts of personal combat experience during the war, in 1928 he began writing &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;, a fictional work based on his own experiences in the trenches. He was now in love with Prudence Pelham, who was its muse.

===1930s===
From 1929 through the mid-1930s, Jones took part in weekly meetings at the Chelsea house of his friend Thomas Ferrier Burns of what has been called the Chelsea Group. It included the cultural historian Christopher Dawson, the philosopher E. I. Watkin, the type-designer Stanley Morison, Harman Grisewood, Bernard Wall, Eric Gill, Martin D&#x27;Arcy and others. They discussed a wide range of topics in relation to Catholic Christianity and sought a religious-cultural counterpart to the Unified Field Theory sought by Einstein. To these discussions, Jones contributed his psychological theory of culture, focusing on the balance of utility (efficiency) and gratuity (beauty, truth, goodness) required for healthy civilization. The Chelsea Group would be the matrix of &quot;The Anathemata&quot;, &quot;The Tablet&quot;, edited by Tom Burns, and the Third Programme, the BBC&#x27;s cultural radio station developed and produced by Grisewood.

Jones had long suffered from shell-shock, now known as post-traumatic stress disorder. It contributed to a nervous breakdown in mid-October 1932, precipitated by four months of prolific painting and writing, involving 60 large paintings and the first continuous draft of &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;. His friends arranged for him to take a therapeutic trip to Jerusalem, which did not alleviate his condition, but influenced his later poetry. His breakdown precluded painting for most of the next 16 years. He was able to work at revising &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;. As he revised, he read it aloud to close friends, including Jim Ede, who alerted Richard de la Mare at Faber and Faber, to whom Jones agreed to submit it when complete. In 1937 it was published to very positive reviews and in 1938 won the Hawthornden Prize, then the one major British literary award.

Though Jones was unable to paint, his visual works were shown in Chicago in 1933, at the Venice Biennale in 1934, and at the World&#x27;s Fair, New York, in 1939. In 1944 an exhibition of his art work toured Britain.

===Later life===
Jones spent most of the Second World War in London, enduring the Blitz. He painted a few important pictures, and to celebrate the wedding of his friend Harman Grisewood to Margaret Bailey, wrote &quot;Prothalamion&quot; and &quot;Epithalamion&quot;, which were eventually published posthumously.

In 1947 Jones created, in a single week, ten land-and-skyscapes at Helen Sutherland&#x27;s house in Cumberland. As in 1932, this burst of activity precipitated a nervous collapse. He underwent psychotherapy at Bowden House in Harrow on the Hill, under the psychologist William (&#x27;Bill&#x27;) Stevenson. Influenced by Freud, Stevenson traced Jones&#x27;s breakdown to oedipal and sibling tensions, combined with repressed fear during the war, explaining that, if allowed to strengthen, repression in the sexual domain shifted to repression of artistic freedom. He advised Jones to paint and write as essential to his healing. This led Jones throughout the 1950s to make many beautiful painted inscriptions (an art form he invented), along with sometimes numinous still lifes of flowers in glass chalices. He was able to publish in 1952 his second epic-length poem &quot;The Anathemata&quot;.

In 1954 an Arts Council tour of his work visited Aberystwyth, Cardiff, Swansea, Edinburgh and the Tate Gallery, London. In 1960, Stevenson began prescribing barbiturates and other harmful drugs that sent Jones&#x27;s creative life into a virtual standstill for the next 12 years, though he struggled to revise and shape mid-length poems for inclusion in &quot;The Sleeping Lord&quot; (1974), a project he managed to complete after the prescriptions were terminated in the summer of 1972. In 1974 Jones was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, an honour restricted to 65 living members (excluding honorary appointments).

In 1970 Jones broke the ball of his femur in a fall and thereafter lived in a room at Calvary Nursing Home in Harrow, where he was regularly visited by friends and died in his sleep on 27–28 October 1974. He was buried in Ladywell and Brockley Cemetery. In 1985, he was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled at Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey.

==Art==
Although Jones began exhibiting paintings in London galleries in 1919, his chief public creative expression was initially engraving. Soon after learning how to engrave, he entered the vanguard of the renewal of wood-engraving as an artform (instead of the reproductive craft it had been through most of the 19th century). He was among the first modern engravers to combine white-line and black-line engraving. His two acknowledged masterpieces of book illustration are &quot;The Chester Play of the Deluge&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (1929). In both of these, engravings mirror one another in design and are arranged in the text to form a chiasmic structure. Jones would use this structure to give unifying symbolic form to his second epic-length poem, &quot;The Anathemata&quot;.

His meager income came chiefly from painting, which evolved in style throughout his life. Breaking from art-school realism, he adopted the thick-boundary-line and sculptural style of Christian primitivism, which had affinity with the style of the London School. The dramatic landscape of Capel-y-ffin liberated him from fixed, stationary point of view. Having drawn maps during World War I, he reverted to thin-line &quot;drawing with the point&quot;, which he had learned of from Hartrick. Painting the sea at Caldey Island and Portslade opened him to see water and sky as continuous, an active continuity that came to include the land. The subtleties of his mostly watercolour paintings after 1929 require patient and repeated viewing. In the 7 and 5 Society he was influenced by Winnifred Nicholson in painting freely, relying on more colour, less line, coming close to abstraction. After his first breakdown he painted &quot;Aphrodite in Aulis&quot; and two Arthurian paintings that, loaded with symbols, are &quot;literary&quot; in requiring &quot;reading&quot; as well as viewing. He longed to combine such multi-symbolic work with his earlier stylistic freedom. And he achieved such a combination in his painted inscriptions, which involve mostly ancient texts. In juxtaposing quotations, these inscriptions are modernist in aesthetic. Most are in Latin or Welsh because he wanted them viewed, not read. Saunders Lewis was the first to note that these inscriptions combine Jones&#x27;s painting with his poetry. Union of symbolism with freedom is also achieved in his still-lifes of flowers in glass chalices. In undergoing so much change, Jones&#x27;s visual art managed to be alive as only the new can. As a painter, he was, according to Kenneth Clark, &quot;absolutely unique, a remarkable genius&quot;.

==Poetry ==

&quot;In Parenthesis&quot; (1937) is an epic narrative poem based on Jones&#x27;s first seven months in the trenches culminating in the assault on Mametz Wood during the Battle of the Somme. It is a dense mixture of polyphonic of voices, varying in register, in verse and prose-lines. The richness of its language establishes it as poetry, which is what Jones considered it. His literary debut, it won high praise from reviewers, many of them former servicemen, for whom its vivid language evoked the realities of trench warfare. They saw its allusions to the horrors of romance and to the battles of history and legend (all seen as defeats) as accurately expressing the feelings of men in combat. The poem draws on literary influences from the 6th-century Welsh epic &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins and &quot;Anabase&quot; by Saint-John Perse (translated by Eliot), in an attempt to be true to the experiences of combatants. The cumulative force is emotionally powerful. That and the reader&#x27;s having got to know the infantrymen involved makes the concluding visitation of the dead by the Queen of the Woods a deeply moving literary experience. On 11 July 1937 when he met Jones, W. B. Yeats elaborately praised &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;. T. S. Eliot considered it &quot;a work of genius&quot;. W. H. Auden declared it &quot;the greatest book about the First World War.&quot; The war historian Michael Howard called it &quot;the most remarkable work of literature to emerge from either world war.&quot; Graham Greene in 1980 thought it &quot;among the great poems of the century.&quot; In 1996 the poet and novelist Adam Thorpe said &quot;it towers above any other prose or verse memorial of ... any war.&quot; Herbert Read called it &quot;one of the most remarkable literary achievements of our time.&quot; It is probably the greatest literary work on war in English.

Also epic in length (244 pages with Introduction), &quot;The Anathemata&quot; (1952) is Jones&#x27;s poetic summa, a symbolic dramatic, multi-voiced anatomy of Western culture. Sweeping back and forth through prehistory and historical periods, it focuses thematically on the making of gratuitous signs as an activity essential to humanity, which flourishes during vital culture phases and languishes in predominantly pragmatic periods, such as ours and that of imperial Rome. The poem moves digressively, as interior and dramatic monologues open to include other monologues, forming a chiastic structure of eight concentric circles. The outer circle is formed by the poem beginning with the elevation of the host during the consecration of the Mass and ending 200 pages (6 or 7 seconds) later with the elevation of the chalice. At the centre of the work&#x27;s chiastic circles is a lyrical celebration of the events contained sacramentally by the Eucharist. Symbolically the structure means that the Eucharist as a super-sign of God&#x27;s loving union with humanity is contained and sustained by everything in the poem, from Anglo-Saxon cultural genocide to a medieval lavender seller&#x27;s remembered sexual liaisons. Its chiastic recession of circles makes this the only modernist long poem &quot;open&quot; in form that is structurally unified. After reading and rereading it for six months, W. H. Auden called it &quot;probably the greatest poem of the twentieth century&quot; and compared it to the inclusive, culturally authoritative long poems of Homer, Virgil, Dante, Chaucer, and Milton. Jones thought it was &quot;worth 50 &#x27;In Parentheses&#x27;&quot; and the most important of any work he had done.

Until 1960, Jones worked intermittently on a long poem, of which material in &quot;The Anathemata&quot; had initially been meant to form part. Jones used sections of the left-over material mainly in the magazine &quot;Agenda&quot; and collected it in &quot;The Sleeping Lord and Other Fragments&quot; (1974). A posthumous volume of the unseen material was edited by Harman Grisewood and René Hague and published by Agenda Editions as &quot;The Roman Quarry&quot;. It has since been re-edited by Thomas Goldpaugh and Jamie Callison in &quot;The Grail Mass&quot; (Bloomsbury 2018). In these drafts, the monologue material of Judas and Caiaphas has a quality that certainly deserved to be published by Jones in his lifetime.

In 2002, three short poems by Jones appeared for the first time in &quot;Wedding Poems&quot;, edited by Thomas Dilworth. Jones had written two of these, &quot;Prothalamion&quot; and &quot;Epithalamion&quot;, totalling 271 lines, during the Blitz in London. The third, the 24 lines of &quot;The Brenner&quot;, arose on 18 March 1940 to mark a meeting of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler on the Brenner Pass.

&quot;The Sleeping Lord&quot; (1974) contains one short poem, &quot;A, a, a, Domine Deus&quot;, a lament for contemporary technological impoverishment), and eight mid-length poems: four of them monologues, or involving monologues, by Roman soldiers stationed in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion. Three others involve Celtic personae. The final mid-length poem is a darkly comical consideration of an assault during the Battle of Passchendaele, in which Western tradition and its values confront mechanized mass suicide. More than any other collection or sequence of poems in English, these works test traditional values in the face of modern mechanized war, technological pragmatism and political totalitarianism. Seamus Heaney thought them &quot;extraordinary&quot; writing. The American poet W. S. Merwin called them &quot;some of Jones&#x27;s great splendours&quot;. Among them, &quot;The Hunt&quot; (beautifully recorded by Jones) and &quot;The Tutelar of the Place&quot; are musically especially lyrical – they ought to be anthologized. These eight mid-length poems – and first of all these two – probably make the most welcome start to reading Jones&#x27;s poetry.

==Essays==
Jones&#x27;s occasional essays on art, literature, religion and history, introductions to books and talks on the BBC Third Programme have been collected in &quot;Epoch and Artist&quot; (Faber, 1959), &quot;The Dying Gaul&quot; (Faber, 1978) and &quot;David Jones on Religion, Politics, and Culture: Unpublished Prose&quot; (Bloomsbury, 2018). The most important essays include &quot;Art and Sacrament&quot;, his fullest exposition of his theory of culture; &quot;Use and Sign&quot;, his most succinct exposition of that theory; &quot;Introduction to &#x27;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&#x27;&quot;, intriguing in itself and helpful for appreciating &quot;The Anathemata&quot;; and &quot;The Myth of Arthur&quot;, deepening understanding of &quot;The Hunt&quot; and the concluding, eponymous poem in &quot;The Sleeping Lord&quot; and, with these two poems, an important contribution to the Matter of Britain&#x27;. Harold Rosenberg wrote that Jones&#x27;s essays on culture &quot;formulated the axiomatic precondition for understanding contemporary creation.&quot; Guy Davenport saw in them that Jones &quot;realized for us the new configuration, which only our time can see, into which culture seems to be shaped, and the historical processes that shaped it.&quot;

==Reputation==
With the centenary of the 1914–1918 War, Jones gained wider attention through British TV documentaries, notably &quot;War of Words: Soldier-Poets of the Somme&quot; on the BBC. Since 2014 Jones has increasingly been seen as an original, major poet and visual artist of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banks/Hills, p. 164&quot;&gt;Ariane Banks and Paul Hills: &quot;The Art of David Jones: Vision and Memory&quot;, Lund Humphries, 2015, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging from its rapidly rising prices, Jones&#x27;s visual art is now fairly well and widely appreciated. Several notable exhibitions of his engravings, paintings and inscriptions, during his life and since, have attested to the popularity of his visual art, most recently &quot;Vision and Memory&quot; at the Pallant House Gallery, Chichester. His visual works can now be seen online, in talks on Jones by Dilworth and films directed by Derek Sheil such as &quot;David Jones Innovation and Consolidation&quot;.
Jones has been less appreciated as a poet, partly because his long, highly allusive poems are hard reading for many. Although &quot;In Parenthesis&quot; received positive reviews in 1937 and won the Hawthornden Prize in 1938, reader interest was cut short by the Second World War, which eclipsed interest in the earlier war. Till recently, &quot;In Parenthesis&quot; and &quot;The Anathemata&quot; have been missing from most academic studies of literary modernism. The fault is their publisher, Faber, which from the start failed to list them as poems or Jones as among its poets. (&quot;The Anathemata&quot; was strangely listed under Autobiographies and Memoirs.) Not until 1970, after complaints by William Cookson, editor of &quot;Agenda&quot;, and Stuart Montgomery, editor of The Fulcrum Press, did Faber correct the error, long after the Modernist canon had been established, largely by the American New Critics. Since 1970, academic assessment of Jones&#x27;s poetry has been catching up with his reputation as a visual artist. But the process was initially stalled by Paul Fussell&#x27;s judgement against &quot;In Paraenthesis&quot; in &quot;The Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (Oxford, 1975), as glorifying war by alluding to romance, a judgement that continues to discourage scholarly engagement, even though repeatedly effectively refuted. And the liturgical allusions and eucharistic focus in his later poetry do not appeal to most academics, who are secular-minded. The voices calling attention to his poetry have mainly been those of creative practitioners rather than academics. T. S. Eliot saw Jones as &quot;of major importance&quot;, &quot;one of the most distinguished writers of my generation.&quot; Dylan Thomas said, &quot;I would like to have done anything as good as David Jones.&quot; In 1974 Hugh MacDiarmid pronounced Jones &quot;the greatest native British poet of the century.&quot; In 1965, Igor Stravinsky thought him &quot;perhaps the greatest living writer in English&quot;. The art historian Herbert Read called him in 1964 &quot;one of the greatest writers of our time&quot;.

<doc id="57344" wikidata="Q223880" url="?curid=57344" title="Emma (novel)">
<text>Emma is a novel written by English author Jane Austen. It is set in the fictional country village of Highbury and the surrounding estates of Hartfield, Randalls and Donwell Abbey, and involves the relationships among people from a small number of families. The novel was first published in December 1815, although the title page is dated 1816. As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian–Regency England. &quot;Emma&quot; is a comedy of manners.

Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.&quot; In the first sentence, she introduces the title character by stating &quot;Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and a happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.&quot; Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people&#x27;s lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.

&quot;Emma&quot;, written after Austen&#x27;s move to Chawton, was her last novel to be published during her lifetime, while &quot;Persuasion&quot;, the last complete novel Austen wrote, was published posthumously.

The novel has been adapted for a number of films, television programmes and stage plays.

==Plot summary==
Emma Woodhouse&#x27;s friend and former governess, Miss Taylor, has just married Mr. Weston. Having introduced them, Emma takes credit for their marriage and decides that she likes matchmaking. After returning home to Hartfield, Emma forges ahead with her new interest against the advice of her friend Mr. Knightley, whose brother is married to Emma&#x27;s elder sister, Isabella. She attempts to match her new friend, Harriet Smith, to Mr. Elton, the local vicar. Emma persuades Harriet to refuse a marriage proposal from Robert Martin, a respectable young farmer, although Harriet likes him. Mr. Elton, a social climber, mistakenly believes Emma is in love with him and proposes to her. When Emma reveals she believed him attached to Harriet, he is outraged, considering Harriet socially inferior. After Emma rejects him, Mr. Elton goes to Bath and returns with a pretentious, &quot;nouveau-riche&quot; wife, as Mr. Knightley expected he would do. Harriet is heartbroken, and Emma feels ashamed about misleading her.

Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston&#x27;s son, arrives for a two-week visit. Frank was adopted by his wealthy and domineering aunt and has had few opportunities to visit before. Mr. Knightley tells Emma that, while Frank is intelligent and engaging, he has a shallow character. Jane Fairfax also arrives to visit her aunt Miss Bates and grandmother Mrs. Bates for a few months before starting a governess position due to financial situation. She is the same age as Emma and has received an excellent education through her father&#x27;s friend, Colonel Campbell. Emma has remained somewhat aloof from Jane because she envies her and is annoyed by everyone, including Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, praising Jane. Mrs. Elton takes Jane under her wing and announces that she will find a governess post before it is wanted.

Emma decides that Jane and Mr. Dixon, Colonel Campbell&#x27;s new son-in-law, are mutually attracted, and that is the reason she arrived earlier than expected. She confides this to Frank, who met Jane and the Campbells at Weymouth the previous year; he apparently agrees with Emma. Suspicions are further fuelled when a gifted piano, sent anonymously, arrives for Jane. Emma feels herself falling in love with Frank, but it does not last. The Eltons treat Harriet poorly, culminating in Mr. Elton publicly snubbing Harriet at a ball. Mr. Knightley, who normally refrained from dancing, gallantly asks Harriet to dance. The day after the ball, Frank brings Harriet to Hartfield, as she fainted after a rough encounter with local gypsies. Emma mistakes Harriet&#x27;s gratitude to Frank as Harriet being in love with him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Weston wonders if Mr. Knightley is attracted to Jane, but Emma dismisses the idea. When Mr. Knightley says he notices a connection between Jane and Frank, Emma disagrees, as Frank appears to be courting her instead. Frank arrives late to a gathering at Donwell, while Jane departs early. The next day at Box Hill, a local scenic spot, Frank and Emma are joking when Emma thoughtlessly insults Miss Bates.

When Mr. Knightley scolds Emma for insulting Miss Bates, she is ashamed. The next day, she visits Miss Bates to atone for her bad behaviour, impressing Mr. Knightley. During the visit, Emma learns that Jane has accepted a governess position from one of Mrs. Elton&#x27;s friends. Jane becomes ill and refuses to see Emma or receive her gifts. Meanwhile, Frank has been visiting his aunt, who dies soon after his arrival. He and Jane reveal to the Westons that they have been secretly engaged since autumn, but Frank knew his aunt would disapprove of the match. Maintaining the secrecy strained the conscientious Jane and caused the couple to quarrel, with Jane ending the engagement. Frank&#x27;s easygoing uncle readily gives his blessing to the match. The engagement is made public, leaving Emma annoyed to discover that she had been so wrong.

Emma believes Frank&#x27;s engagement will devastate Harriet, but instead, Harriet says she loves Mr. Knightley, and though she knows the match is too unequal, Emma&#x27;s encouragement and Mr. Knightley&#x27;s kindness have given her hope. Emma is startled and realises that she is also in love with Mr. Knightley. Mr. Knightley returns to console Emma about Frank and Jane&#x27;s engagement, thinking her heartbroken. When she admits her foolishness, he proposes, and she accepts. Harriet accepts Robert Martin&#x27;s second proposal, and they are the first couple to marry. Jane and Emma reconcile, and Frank and Jane visit the Westons. Once the mourning period for Frank&#x27;s aunt ends, they will marry. Before the end of November, Emma and Mr. Knightley are married with the prospect of &quot;perfect happiness.&quot;

==Principal characters==
Emma Woodhouse, the protagonist of the story, is a beautiful, high-spirited, intelligent, and somewhat spoiled young woman from the landed gentry. She is twenty when the story opens. Her mother died when she was young. She has been mistress of the house (Hartfield) since her older sister got married. Although intelligent, she lacks the discipline to practise or study anything in depth. She is portrayed as compassionate to the poor, but at the same time has a strong sense of class status. Her affection for and patience towards her valetudinarian father are also noteworthy. While she is in many ways mature, Emma makes some serious mistakes, mainly due to her lack of experience and her conviction that she is always right. Although she has vowed she will never marry, she delights in making matches for others. She has a brief flirtation with Frank Churchill; however, she realises at the end of the novel that she loves Mr Knightley.

Mr Knightley is a neighbour and close friend of Emma, aged 37 years. He is her only critic. Mr Knightley is the owner of the estate of Donwell Abbey, which includes extensive grounds and farms. He is the elder brother of Mr John Knightley, the husband of Emma&#x27;s elder sister Isabella. He is very considerate, aware of the feelings of the other characters, and his behaviour and judgment are extremely good. Mr Knightley is furious with Emma for persuading Harriet to turn down Mr Martin, a farmer on the Donwell estate; he warns Emma against pushing Harriet towards Mr Elton, knowing that Mr Elton seeks a bride with money. He is suspicious of Frank Churchill and his motives; he suspects that Frank has a secret understanding with Jane Fairfax.

Frank Churchill, Mr Weston&#x27;s son by his first marriage, is an amiable young man, who, at age 23, is liked by almost everyone, though Mr Knightley sees him as immature and selfish for failing to visit his father after his father&#x27;s wedding. After his mother&#x27;s death, he was raised by his wealthy aunt and uncle, the Churchills, at the family estate of Enscombe in Yorkshire. His uncle was his mother&#x27;s brother. By his aunt&#x27;s decree, he assumed the name Churchill on his majority. Frank is given to dancing and living a carefree existence, and is secretly engaged to Miss Fairfax at Weymouth, although he fears his aunt will forbid the match because Jane is not wealthy. He manipulates and plays games with the other characters to ensure his engagement to Jane remains concealed.

Jane Fairfax is an orphan whose only family consists of her aunt, Miss Bates, and her grandmother, Mrs Bates. She is a beautiful, bright, and elegant woman, with the best of manners. She is the same age as Emma. She is very well-educated and talented at singing and playing the piano; she is the only person whom Emma envies. Colonel Campbell, an army friend of Jane&#x27;s father, felt responsible for Jane, and has provided her with an excellent education while she has shared his home and family since she was nine years old. She has little fortune, however, and is destined to become a governess – an unpleasant prospect. The secret engagement goes against her principles and distresses her greatly.

Harriet Smith, a young friend of Emma, just seventeen when the story opens, is a beautiful but unsophisticated girl. She has been a pupil at a nearby school, where she met the sisters of Mr Martin. As a parlour boarder at the school she now helps supervise younger pupils. Emma takes Harriet under her wing early on, and she becomes the subject of Emma&#x27;s misguided matchmaking attempts. She is revealed in the last chapter to be the natural daughter of a decent tradesman, although he is not a gentleman. Harriet and Mr Martin are wed. The now wiser Emma approves of the match.

Robert Martin is a well-to-do, 24-year-old tenant farmer who, though not a gentleman, is a friendly, amiable and diligent young man, well esteemed by Mr George Knightley. He becomes acquainted and subsequently smitten with Harriet during her 2-month stay at Abbey Mill Farm, which was arranged at the invitation of his sister, Elizabeth Martin, Harriet&#x27;s school friend. His first marriage proposal, in a letter, is rejected by Harriet under Emma&#x27;s direction and influence (an incident which puts Mr Knightley and Emma in a disagreement with one another). Emma had convinced herself that Harriet&#x27;s class and breeding were above associating with the Martins, much less marrying one. His second marriage proposal is later accepted by a contented Harriet and approved by a wiser Emma; their joining marks the first of the three happy couples to marry in the end.

Reverend Philip Elton is a good-looking, initially well-mannered, and ambitious young vicar, 27 years old and unmarried when the story opens. He is well aware of his good looks and status, and it is only when he is around men that he shows his true colours and reveals his schemes to marry a wealthy woman. Emma wants him to marry Harriet; however, he aspires to secure Emma&#x27;s hand in marriage to gain her dowry of £30,000. Mr Elton displays his mercenary nature by quickly marrying another woman of means after Emma rejects him.

Augusta Elton, formerly Miss Hawkins, is Mr Elton&#x27;s wife. She has 10,000 pounds &quot;or thereabouts&quot; (the vague description of her dowry perhaps suggests she is not as wealthy as she claims), but lacks good manners, committing common vulgarities such as using people&#x27;s names too intimately (as in &quot;Jane&quot;, not &quot;Miss Fairfax&quot;; &quot;Knightley&quot;, not &quot;Mr Knightley&quot;). She is a boasting, pretentious woman who expects her due as a new bride in the village. Emma is polite to her but does not like her and the two instantly become passive-aggressive enemies. She patronises Jane, which earns Jane the sympathy of others. Her lack of social graces shows the good breeding of the other characters, particularly Miss Fairfax and Mrs Weston, and shows the difference between gentility and money. Mrs Elton repeatedly makes contradictory and unbelievable declarations about her background, such as exaggerated claims of the similarity between Emma&#x27;s estate, Hartfield, and her brother-in-law&#x27;s manor, Maple Grove, revealing her dishonesty and enforcing the idea that she is a scheming parvenu trying her utmost to conceal her lower origins.

Mrs Weston was Emma&#x27;s governess for sixteen years as Miss Anne Taylor and remains her closest friend and confidante after she marries Mr Weston. She is a sensible woman who loves Emma. Mrs Weston acts as a surrogate mother to her former charge and, occasionally, as a voice of moderation and reason. The Weston and the Woodhouse families see each other almost daily. Near the end of the story, the Westons&#x27; baby Anna is born.

Mr Weston is a widower and a businessman living in Highbury who marries Miss Taylor in his early 40s, after buying a house called Randalls. By his first marriage, he is father to Frank Weston Churchill, who was adopted and raised by his late wife&#x27;s brother and his wife. He sees his son in London each year. He married his first wife, Miss Churchill, when he was a captain in the militia, posted near her home. Mr Weston is a sanguine, optimistic man, who enjoys socialising, making friends quickly in business and among his neighbours.

Miss Bates is a friendly, garrulous spinster whose mother, Mrs Bates, is a friend of Mr Woodhouse. Her niece is Jane Fairfax, daughter of her late sister. She was raised in better circumstances in her younger days as the vicar&#x27;s daughter; now she and her mother rent rooms in Highbury. One day, Emma humiliates her on a day out in the country, when she alludes to her tiresome prolixity.

Mr Henry Woodhouse, Emma&#x27;s father, is always concerned for his health, and to the extent that it does not interfere with his own, the health and comfort of his friends. He is a valetudinarian (i.e., similar to a hypochondriac but more likely to be genuinely ill). He assumes that a great many things are hazardous to his health, especially draughts of wind. Emma gets along with him well, and he loves both his daughters. He laments that &quot;poor Isabella&quot; and especially &quot;poor Miss Taylor&quot; have married and live away from him. He is a fond father and fond grandfather who did not remarry when his wife died; instead he brought in Miss Taylor to educate his daughters and become part of the family. Because he is generous and well-mannered, his neighbours accommodate him when they can.

Isabella Knightley (née Woodhouse) is the elder sister of Emma, by seven years, and daughter of Henry. She is married to John Knightley. She lives in London with her husband and their five children (Henry, &#x27;little&#x27; John, Bella, &#x27;little&#x27; Emma, and George). She is similar in disposition to her father, and her relationship to Mr Wingfield, (her family&#x27;s physician) mirrors that of her father&#x27;s to Mr Perry.

John Knightley is Isabella&#x27;s husband and George&#x27;s younger brother, 31 years old. He is a lawyer (either a barrister or solicitor) by profession. Like the others raised in the area, he is a friend of Jane Fairfax. He greatly enjoys the company of his family, including his brother and his Woodhouse in-laws, but is not a very sociable man. He is forthright with Emma, his sister-in-law.

==Minor characters==
Mr Perry is the apothecary in Highbury. He is never shown directly speaking but spends a significant amount of time responding to the health issues of Mr Woodhouse. He and Mrs Perry have several children. He is also the subject of a discussion between Miss Bates and Jane Fairfax that is relayed in a letter to Mr Frank Churchill which he inadvertently discloses to Emma, thus risking discovery of his link with Jane Fairfax. He is described as an &quot;...intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr Woodhouse&#x27;s life.&quot;

Mrs Bates is the widow of the former vicar of Highbury, the mother of Miss Bates and the grandmother of Jane Fairfax. She is old and hard of hearing, but is a frequent companion to Mr Woodhouse when Emma attends social activities without him.

Mr &amp; Mrs Cole have been residents of Highbury for several years, but have recently benefited from a significant increase in their income that has allowed them to expand the size of their house, number of servants and other expenses. Despite their &quot;low origin&quot; in trade, their income and style of living have made them the second most prominent family in Highbury, next to the Woodhouses at Hartfield. They host a dinner party that is a significant plot element.

Mrs Churchill was the wife of the brother of Mr Weston&#x27;s first wife. She and her husband, Mr Churchill, live at Enscombe in Yorkshire and raised Mr Weston&#x27;s son, Mr Frank Churchill after the death of Frank&#x27;s mother. Although never seen directly, she makes demands on Frank Churchill&#x27;s time and attention that prevent him from visiting his father. Her potential disapproval is the reason that the engagement between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax is kept secret. Her death provides the opportunity for the secret to be revealed.

Colonel and Mrs Campbell were friends of Jane Fairfax&#x27;s late father. Since Jane was their guest for extended visits, they took over her education in preparation for her working as a governess when she grew up. They provided her every advantage possible, short of adoption, and were very fond of her.

Mrs Goddard is the mistress of a boarding school for girls in which Harriet Smith is one of the pupils. She is also a frequent companion to Mr Woodhouse along with Mrs Bates.

Mr William Larkins is an employee on the Donwell Abbey estate of Mr Knightley. He frequently visits the Bateses, bringing them gifts, such as apples, from Mr Knightley.

==Publication history==

&quot;Emma&quot; was written after the publication of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and was submitted to the London publisher John Murray II in the autumn of 1815. He offered Austen £450 for this plus the copyrights of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, which she refused. Instead, she published two thousand copies of the novel at her own expense, retaining the copyright and paying a 10% commission to Murray. The publication in December 1815 (dated 1816) consisted of a three-volume set in duodecimo at the selling price of £1.1s (one guinea) per set.

Prior to publication, Austen&#x27;s novels had come to the attention of the Prince Regent, whose librarian at Carlton House, a Mr Clarke, showed her around the Library at the Prince Regent&#x27;s request, and who suggested a dedication to the Prince Regent in a future publication. This resulted in a dedication of &quot;Emma&quot; to the Prince Regent at the time of publication and a dedication copy of the novel sent to Carlton House in December 1815.

In America, copies of this first publication were sold in 1818 for $4 per copy, as well as an American edition published by Mathew Carey of Philadelphia in 1816. The number of copies of this edition are not known. A later American edition was published in 1833 and again in 1838 by Carey, Lea, and Blanchard. A French version was published in 1816 by Arthus Bertrand, publisher for Madame Isabelle De Montolieu. A second French version for the Austrian market was published in 1817 Viennese publisher Schrambl.

Richard Bentley reissued &quot;Emma&quot; in 1833, along with Austen&#x27;s five other novels, in his series of Standard Novels. This issue did not contain the dedication page to the Prince Regent. These editions were frequently reprinted up until 1882 with the final publication of the Steventon Edition. &quot;Emma&quot; has remained in continuous publication in English throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In addition to the French translation already mentioned, &quot;Emma&quot; was translated into Swedish and German in the nineteenth century and into fifteen other languages in the twentieth century including Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German and Italian.

==Reception==

Prior to publishing, John Murray&#x27;s reader, William Gifford, who was also the editor of the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, said of the novel that &quot;Of &quot;Emma&quot; I have nothing but good to say. I was sure of the writer before you mentioned her. The MS though plainly written has yet some, indeed many little omissions, and an expression may now and then be amended in passing through the press. I will readily undertake the revision.&quot; Early reviews of &quot;Emma&quot; were generally favourable, and were more numerous than those of any other of Austen&#x27;s novels. One important review, requested by John Murray prior to publication and written by Sir Walter Scott, appeared anonymously in March 1816 in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, although the date of the journal was October 1815. He writes:The author is already known to the public by the two novels announced in her title page, and both, the last especially, attracted, with justice, an attention from the public far superior to what is granted to the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering- places and circulating libraries. They belong to a class of fictions which has arisen almost in our own times, and which draws the characters and incidents introduced more immediately from the current of ordinary life than was permitted by the former rules of the novel...&quot;Emma&quot; has even less story than either of the preceding novels...The author&#x27;s knowledge of the world, and the peculiar tact with which she presents characters that the reader cannot fail to recognize, reminds us something of the merits of the Flemish school of painting. The subjects are not often elegant, and certainly never grand: but they are finished up to nature, and with a precision which delights the reader.Two other unsigned reviews appeared in 1816, one in &quot;The Champion,&quot; also in March, and another in September of the same year in &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine.&quot; Other commenters include Thomas Moore, the Irish poet, singer and entertainer who was a contemporary of Austen&#x27;s; he wrote to Samuel Rogers, an English poet, in 1816:&quot;Let me entreat you to read &quot;Emma&quot; – it is the very perfection of novel-writing – and I cannot praise it more highly than by saying it is often extremely like your own method of describing things – so much effect with so little effort!&quot;
A contemporary Scottish novelist, Susan Edmonstone Ferrier, wrote to a friend, also in 1816:&quot;I have been reading &quot;Emma&quot;, which is excellent; there is no story whatever, and the heroine is not better than other people; but the characters are all true to life and the style so piquant, that it does not require the adventitious aids of mystery and adventure.&quot;
There was some criticism about the lack of story. John Murray remarked that it lacked &quot;incident and Romance&quot;; Maria Edgeworth, the author of &quot;Belinda&quot;, to whom Austen had sent a complimentary copy, wrote:there was no story in it, except that Miss Emma found that the man whom she designed for Harriet&#x27;s lover was an admirer of her own – &amp; he was affronted at being refused by Emma &amp; Harriet wore the willow – and &quot;smooth, thin water-gruel&quot; is according to Emma&#x27;s father&#x27;s opinion a very good thing &amp; it is very difficult to make a cook understand what you mean by &quot;smooth, thin water-gruel&quot;!!
Austen also collected comments from friends and family on their opinions of &quot;Emma&quot;. Writing several years later, John Henry Newman observed in a letter about the novel:Everything Miss Austen writes is clever, but I desiderate something. There is a want of body to the story. The action is frittered away in over-little things. There are some beautiful things in it. Emma herself is the most interesting to me of all her heroines. I feel kind to her whenever I think of her...That other woman, Fairfax, is a dolt- but I like Emma.
Later reviewers or commenters on the novel include Charlotte Brontë, George Henry Lewes, Juliet Pollock, Anne Ritchie, Henry James, Reginald Farrer, Virginia Woolf, and E. M. Forster. Other reviewers include Thomas Babington Macaulay who considered Austen to be a &quot;Prose Shakespeare&quot;, and Margaret Oliphant who stated in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot; in March that she prefers &quot;Emma&quot; to Austen&#x27;s other works and that it is &quot;the work of her mature mind&quot;. Although Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the most popular of her novels, Robert McCrum suggests that &quot;Emma&quot; &quot;is her masterpiece, mixing the sparkle of her early books with a deep sensibility&quot;. Additionally, academic John Mullan argued that &quot;Emma&quot; was a revolutionary novel which changed the shape of what is possible in fiction&quot; because it &quot;bent narration through the distorting lens of its protagonist’s mind&quot;.

==Themes==

===Highbury as a character===
The British critic Robert Irvine wrote that unlike the situation in Austen&#x27;s previous novels, the town of Highbury in Surrey emerges as a character in its own right. Irvine wrote that: &quot;In &quot;Emma&quot;, we find something much closer to a genuinely communal voice, a point of view at work in the narrative that cannot be reduced to the subjectivity of any one character. This point of view appears both as something perceived by Emma, an external perspective on events and characters that the reader encounters as and when Emma recognises it; and as an independent discourse appearing in the text alongside the discourse of the narrator and characters&quot;. Irvine used as an example the following passage: &quot;The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of as many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had not thrown himself away-he had gained a woman of £10,000 or thereabouts; and he had gained with delightful rapidity-the first hour of introduction he had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious&quot;. Irvine points out the adjective &quot;charming&quot; appears to the narrator speaking, but notes the sentence goes on to associate &quot;perfect&quot; with &quot;usual&quot;, which he pointed out was an incongruity. Irvine suggested the next sentence &quot;would always be called ten&quot; is in fact the voice of the community of Highbury, which wants the fiancée of Mr Elton to be &quot;perfect&quot;, whom the narrator sarcastically calls the &quot;usual&quot; sort of community gossip is about a new arrival in Highbury, whom everyone thinks is &quot;charming&quot;. Since the character of Mrs Elton is in fact far from &quot;charming&quot;, the use of the term &quot;charming&quot; to describe her is either the gossip of Highbury and/or the narrator being sarcastic.

Likewise, the Australian scholar John Wiltshire wrote that one of Austen&#x27;s achievements was to &quot;give depth&quot; to the &quot;Highbury world&quot;. Wiltshire noted that Austen put the population of Highbury as 352 people, and said that although clearly most of these people do not appear as characters - or at best as minor characters - Austen created the impression of Highbury as a &quot;social commonwealth&quot;. Wiltshire used as an example of Mr Perry, the town apothecary who is frequently mentioned in the town gossip, but never appears in the book, having a &quot;kind of familiarity by proxy&quot;. Wiltshire also notes the scene where Emma and Harriet visit a poor cottage on the outskirts of Highbury; during their walk, it is made clear from Emma&#x27;s remarks that this part of Highbury is not her Highbury.

The character of Frank is a member of the &quot;discursive community&quot; of Highbury long before he actually appears, as his father tells everyone in Highbury about him. Emma forms her judgement of Frank based on what she hears about him in Highbury before she meets him. Irvine wrote that Austen&#x27;s use of three different voices in &quot;Emma&quot;—the voice of Highbury, the narrator&#x27;s voice, and Emma&#x27;s voice, can at times make it very confusing to the reader about just who is actually speaking. However, Irvine wrote that one accepts that the voice of Highbury is often speaking, then much of the book makes sense, as Emma believes she has a power that she does not, to make Frank either love or not via her interest or indifference, which is explained as the result of the gossip of Highbury, which attributes Emma this power.

This is especially the case as Emma is born into the elite of Highbury, which is portrayed as a female-dominated world. Irvine wrote that Elizabeth Bennet in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and Fanny Price in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; enjoy the moral authority of being good women, but must marry a well-off man to have the necessary social influence to fully use this moral authority whereas Emma is born with this authority. Emma herself acknowledges this when she says to Harriet that she possesses: &quot;none of the usual inducements to marry...Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want&quot;. However, political power still resides with men in the patriarchal society of Regency England as the book notes that Mr Knightley is not only a member of the gentry, but also serves as the magistrate of Highbury. Emma clashes with Knightley at the beginning of the novel over the all-important &quot;distinctions of rank&quot;, namely does Harriet Smith belong with the yeoman class together with Robert Martin, or the gentry class that Emma and Knightley are both part of. Knightley declares his respect for both Smith and Martin, but argues that as part of the yeomen class, neither belongs with the gentry, while Emma insists on including her best friend/protegee in with the gentry. In Regency England and in &quot;Emma&quot;, the term friendship describes a power relationship where one higher party can do favours for the lower party while the term &quot;claim intimacy&quot; is a relationship of equals. Mrs Elton has &quot;friendship&quot; with Jane Fairfax while she &quot;claims intimacy&quot; with Mr Knightley. The use of these terms &quot;friendship&quot; and &quot;claim intimacy&quot; refers to the question of who belongs to the local elite. Neither Emma nor Mr Knightley question the right of the elite to dominate society, but rather their power struggle is over who belongs to the elite, and who has the authority to make the decision about whom to include and whom to exclude, which shows that in a certain sense that Emma is just as powerful socially as is Mr Knightley. Further complicating this power struggle is the arrival of Mrs Elton, who attempts to elevate Jane Fairfax into the elite. This is cruel as Jane is not rich enough to properly belong to the elite, and Mrs Elton is showing Jane a world to which she can never really belong, no matter how many parties and balls she attends. In addition to her annoyance at Mrs Elton&#x27;s relationship with Jane, Emma finds Mrs Elton an &quot;upstart&quot;, &quot;under-bred&quot; and &quot;vulgar&quot;, which adds venom to the dispute between the two women. Mrs Elton is only a first generation gentry, as her father bought the land that she grew up on with money he had raised in trade. Her snobbery is therefore that of a &quot;nouveau riche&quot;, desperately insecure about her status. When Mrs Elton boasted that her family had owned their estate for a number of years, Emma responds that a true English gentry family would count ownership of their estate in generations, not years.

Of Emma&#x27;s two rivals for social authority, one shares a common class while the other a common sex. The marriage of Emma to Mr Knightley consolidates her social authority by linking herself to the dominant male of Highbury and pushes Mrs Elton&#x27;s claims aside. Irvine wrote: &quot;On this view, and in contrast to Austen&#x27;s two previous novels, &quot;Emma&quot; works to legitimate established gentry power &quot;defined in opposition to&quot; an autonomous feminine authority over the regulation of social relations, and not through the vindication of such autonomous authority&quot;. However, as the novel goes, such a reading is countered by the way that Emma begins to take in the previously excluded into the realm of the elite, such as visiting the poor Miss Bates and her mother, and the Coles, whose wealth stems from trade. Likewise, Jane Fairfax, who is too poor to live off her wealth and must work as a governess, which excludes her from the female social elite of Highbury, does marry well after all, which makes her story the only one of real feminine worth triumphing over the lack of wealth in &quot;Emma&quot;.

===Gender reversal===
There are numerous parallels between the main characters and plots of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Emma&quot;: Both novels feature a proud central character, respectively, Darcy and Emma; a critical future spouse, Elizabeth and Mr Knightley; an easily swayed friend, Bingley and Harriet; an almost-thwarted marital ambition, Jane and Martin; a dependent relative, Georgiana and Mr Woodhouse; and a potential object of matrimony who is a wrong choice for the central character, Anne de Bourgh and Frank Churchill. These pairs suggest that &quot;Emma&quot; may have been a gendered reversal of the earlier novel. Such reversals were familiar to Austen through the works of favoured authors like Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, and William Shakespeare.

Austen is thought to have switched gender in some of her earlier work as well. Her cousin Eliza Hancock may have been her inspiration for the character Edward Stanley in &quot;Catharine, or the Bower,&quot; one of her youthful pieces, showing her the &quot;trick of changing the gender of her prototype.&quot; In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Thomas Lefroy, a charming and witty Irishman, may have been the basis for Elizabeth&#x27;s personality, while Austen may have used herself as the model for Darcy&#x27;s reserve and self-consciousness when among company, but open and loving demeanor when among close friends and family. Austen&#x27;s selection of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; as the basis for reversing gender in &quot;Emma&quot; may have been motivated by these earlier experiences and insights.

Reversing the genders of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; in &quot;Emma&quot; allowed Austen to disturb paradigms and examine the different expectations society had of men and women; the elements she chose to include in &quot;Emma&quot; and how she chose to revise them yield a powerful but ultimately conventional commentary on the status of women. The novel&#x27;s central concern with gender is often noted in the literature as themes like gendered space, romance, female empowerment, wealth, parenting, and masculinity.

===Gendered space===
Wiltshire wrote about Austen&#x27;s use of &quot;gendered space&quot; in &quot;Emma&quot;, noting the female characters have a disproportionate number of scenes in the drawing rooms of Highbury while the male characters often have scenes outdoors. Wiltshire noted that Jane Fairfax cannot walk to the post office in the rain to pick up the mail without becoming the object of village gossip while Mr Knightley can ride all the way to London without attracting any gossip. Wiltshire described the world that the women of Highbury live in as a sort of prison, writing that in the novel &quot;...women&#x27;s imprisonment is associated with deprivation, with energies and powers perverted in their application, and events, balls and outings are linked with the arousal and satisfaction of desire&quot;.

===Nationhood and the &quot;Irish Question&quot;===

The novel is set in England, but there are several references to Ireland, which were related to the ongoing national debate about the &quot;Irish Question&quot;. In 1801, the Act of Union had brought Ireland into the United Kingdom, but there was a major debate about what was Ireland&#x27;s precise status in the United Kingdom; another kingdom, province or a colony? Austen satirizes this debate by having Miss Bates talk about Mrs Dixon&#x27;s new house in Ireland, a place that she cannot decide is a kingdom, a country or a province, but is merely very &quot;strange&quot; whatever its status may be. Austen also satirized the vogue for &quot;Irish tales&quot; that became popular after the Act of Union as English writers started to produce picturesque, romantic stories set in Ireland to familiarize the English people with the newest addition to the United Kingdom. The travel itinerary that Miss Bates sketches out for the Campbells&#x27; visit to Ireland is satire of a typical &quot;Irish tale&quot; novel, which was Austen&#x27;s way of mocking those who had a superficial appreciation of Irish culture by buying the &quot;Irish tales&quot; books that presented Ireland in a very stereotypical way. Austen further alludes to the Society of United Irishmen uprising in 1798 by having the other characters worry about what might happen to the Dixons when they visit a place in the Irish countryside called &quot;Baly-craig&quot;, which appears to be Ballycraig in County Antrim in what is now Northern Ireland, which had been the scene of much bloody fighting between the United Irishmen Society and the Crown in 1798, an enduring testament to Ireland&#x27;s unsettled status with much of the Irish population not accepting British rule. The American scholar Colleen Taylor wrote about Austen&#x27;s treatment of the &quot;Irish Question&quot;: &quot;That Emma applies a distant and fictionalized Irish space to her very limited and dissimilar English circle, turning a somewhat ordinary English young woman, Jane Fairfax, into an Irish scandal, proves that the object of English humor is—for once—not the stage Irishman but the privileged English woman who presumes to know what he and his culture are really like.&quot;

===Romance===

In contrast to other Austen heroines, Emma seems immune to romantic attraction, at least until her final self-revelation concerning her true affections. Unlike Marianne Dashwood, who is attracted to the wrong man before she settles on the right one, Emma generally shows no romantic interest in the men she meets and even her flirting with Churchill seems tame. She is genuinely surprised (and somewhat disgusted) when Mr Elton declares his love for her, much in the way Elizabeth Bennet reacts to the obsequious Mr Collins, also a parson. Her fancy for Frank Churchill represents more of a longing for a little drama in her life than a longing for romantic love. For example, at the beginning of Chapter XIII, Emma has &quot;no doubt of her being in love&quot;, but it quickly becomes clear that, even though she spends time &quot;forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment&quot;, we are told that &quot;the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she &quot;refused him&quot;&quot;.

It is only Mr Knightley who can willingly share the burden of Emma&#x27;s father, as well as providing her with guidance, love and companionship. He has been in love with her since she was 13 years old, but neither he nor she have realized that there is a natural bond between them. He declares his love for her: &quot;What did she say? Just what she ought, of course. A lady always does.&quot;.

===Female empowerment===

In &quot;Emma&quot;, Emma Woodhouse serves as a direct reflection of Jane Austen&#x27;s feminist characterization of female heroines, in terms of both female individuality and independence (romantically, financially, etc.). In terms of romantic independence, Emma&#x27;s father, Henry Woodhouse, very consistently preaches against the idea of marriage. He plays an integral role in Emma&#x27;s own initial perception of matrimony, leading her to make use of her free time by becoming the town &quot;matchmaker&quot;, which leaves her happily single and unwed for the majority of the novel. One of the predominant reasons Emma is able to live a comfortable and independent lifestyle is her gifted inheritance—given to her by a past family member—which allows her to depend on no one other than herself for a sustainable, wealthy, and self-sufficient life although she currently lives in her father&#x27;s house. Austen portrays Emma as educated and capable, and extremely popular and well-liked in her hometown of Highbury.

Literary scholar Laurence Mazzeno addresses Austen&#x27;s narrative in regard to female individualism and empowerment, stating, “…Austen deals honestly and with skill in treating relationships between men and women, and presents women of real passion – but not the flamboyant, sentimental kind that populate conventional romances...Austen is not &quot;narrow&quot; in her treatment of character, either; her men and women furnish as broad a view of humanity as would be obtained by traveling up and down the world...Austen was conservative in both her art and her politics – suggesting that, even from a woman&#x27;s point of view, Austen was hardly out to subvert the status quo.&quot;

In the Bedford Edition of &quot;Emma&quot; edited by Alistair M. Duckworth, there are five essays to accompany the text that discuss contemporary critical perspectives, one of which is about feminist criticism. The feminist criticism essay was written by Devoney Looser. In her essay, she asks the question whether Jane Austen was a feminist. She also states in her essay that one&#x27;s answer to the question not only depends on how one understands Austen&#x27;s novels, but also how one defines feminism.

Looser states that if you define feminism broadly as a movement relating to how women are limited and devalued within a culture then Austen&#x27;s work applies to this concept of feminism. She states that if you define feminism as a movement to eradicate gender, race, class, and sexual prejudice and to agitate for change, then Austen&#x27;s work does not really apply to this concept of feminism.

===Wealth===
Emma is a wealthy young woman, having a personal fortune amounting to £30,000. This would be sufficient for her to live independently in the same style as she is accustomed to. As she herself points out, this means that there is no financial pressure on her to marry. This is in sharp contrast to the heroines of Austen&#x27;s other novels, who all lack sufficient resources to maintain as single women the lifestyle in which they have been raised by their families. This means that Emma has greater freedom of choice and behaviour, in some ways closer to that exercised by wealthy men of the time.

===Parenting===
Mr Woodhouse adopted a laissez-faire parenting style when it came to raising Emma. In fact, most of the time it seems that Emma is parenting her father, taking on the role of both daughter and mother. Emma feels entirely responsible for the wellbeing of her father and therefore feels obliged to stay with him. Her father is a selfish but gentle man and does not approve of matrimony. If Emma were to marry he would lose his primary carer. This is not to say that Emma feels restrained by her father, in fact quite the opposite, Emma has the power over the world she inhabits. The narrator announces at the start of the novel: &quot;The real evils of Emma’s situation were the power of having rather too much of her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments&quot; (Austen, 1). Although Mr Woodhouse is lacking as a father figure, Mr Knightley acts as a surrogate father to Emma. Mr Knightley is not afraid to correct Emma&#x27;s behaviour and tell her what she needs to hear. Mr Knightley reprimands Emma when he learns of her match-making and also later when Emma is extremely rude to Miss Bates. Still, the reader cannot ignore the developmental damage that has been caused by Mr Woodhouse&#x27;s indifferent parenting style as Emma struggles to form healthy adult relationships.

===Class===
Class is an important aspect of the novel. The distinctions between the classes are made explicitly clear to the reader by Emma herself and by Austen&#x27;s descriptions. The social class structure has the Woodhouses and Mr Knightley at the top, the Eltons, the Westons, Frank Churchill, and even further down the line Harriet, Robert Martin, and the Bates family including Jane Fairfax. This social class map becomes important when Emma tries to match Mr Elton and Harriet together. Harriet is not considered a match for Elton due to her lowly class standing, despite what Emma encourages her to believe. Emma&#x27;s initial disregard for class standing (as regards Harriet at least) is brought to light by Mr Knightley who tells her to stop encouraging Harriet.

The scholar James Brown argued that the much quoted line where Emma contemplates the Abbey-Mill Farm, which is the embodiment of &quot;English verdure, English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being oppressive&quot; is in fact meant to be ironic. Brown wrote that Austen had a strong appreciation of the land as not only a source of aesthetic pleasure, but also a source of money, an aspect of pre-industrial England that many now miss. In this sense, the beauty of the Abbey-Mill Farm is due to the hard work of Mr Knightley&#x27;s tenant, the farmer Robert Martin, a man whom Emma dismisses as the sort of person &quot;with whom I feel I can have nothing to do&quot; while Knightley praises him as &quot;open, straight forward, and very well judging&quot;. Brown argued that the disconnect between&#x27;s Emma&#x27;s contempt for Mr Martin as a person and her awe at the beauty that is the result of his hard work was Austen&#x27;s way of mocking those in the upper classes who failed to appreciate the farmers who worked the land.

===Food===
There is an abundance of food language in Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Emma&quot;. Food is given, shared, and eaten by characters in almost every chapter. Much research on Jane Austen&#x27;s food language is found in Maggie Lane&#x27;s book titled &quot;Jane Austen and Food&quot;. Lane&#x27;s text provides a general examination of the symbolism of food in Emma and invites further interpretations. Food is used as a symbol to convey class hierarchy, stereotypes and biases throughout the novel. The language and actions that surround food bring the characters of Highbury&#x27;s inner circle closer together. For Emma Woodhouse, food is a symbol of human interdependence and goodwill. No one in Highbury is starving; everyone takes part in the giving and receiving of food. However, food is a strong class divider though it is rarely openly discussed by characters in the novel. There are a few instances when characters allude to lower class individuals outside of their well-fed society. For instance, when Emma discusses her charitable visit with a poor family, Harriet&#x27;s encounter with the gypsy children, and Highbury&#x27;s mysterious chicken thieves. For the most part, the poor in &quot;Emma&quot; are overlooked by the characters in the novel due to their socioeconomic status.

The constant giving and receiving of food in the novel does not occur without motive. Characters are either trying to climb the social ladder or gain the approval or affections of another. The interpretation of the giving and receiving of food in &quot;Emma&quot; can be taken in these different directions; however in terms of love: &quot;The novel (...) is stuffed with gifts of food: Mr Knightley sends the Bates family apples; Mr Martin woos Harriet with some walnuts; and, to further her son&#x27;s suit, Mrs Martin brings Mrs Goddard a goose&quot;. These gifts are not without motive, and food—as it pertains to Emma Woodhouse—only becomes interesting when it pertains to love. &quot;[R]omance is a far more interesting subject than food. Emma quickly reduces the topic of eating to a run of the mill &#x27;any thing,’ and arbitrary and empty screen that only becomes interesting when projected on by those in love&quot;. This becomes evident to the reader when Emma overestimates Mr Elton&#x27;s affections for Harriet from their engaging in conversation about the food at the Cole&#x27;s party. Emma Woodhouse interprets food conversation and gifts of food as means of affection between two lovers.

===Masculinity===
Austen explores the idea of redefining manhood and masculinity with her male characters: particularly Mr Knightley, Mr Woodhouse, and Frank Churchill. In &quot;Emma&quot;, Austen includes typical ideals of English masculinity, including, &quot;familial responsibility, sexual fidelity, and leadership transition…” Mr Woodhouse is portrayed chiefly as foolish and an incompetent father figure. Clark comments on Mr Woodhouse&#x27;s age and how this affects his masculine identity. He resists change and pleasure, yet he is still respected in the community. Mr Knightley is Jane Austen&#x27;s perfect gentleman figure in &quot;Emma&quot;. He has manners, class, and money. Further, he is presented as, &quot;a well-adjusted alternative to these more polarized understandings of masculinity seen in characters of John Willoughby and Edward Ferrars.”

==Allusions to real places==
The fictional Highbury is said to be in Surrey, from London and from Richmond. (It is not to be confused with the real Highbury, which is north of Charing Cross, now part of inner London but in Austen&#x27;s day was in Middlesex.) Highbury was not modelled on a specific village; however, it is likely that it is modelled after several places that Austen knew, such as Cobham and Box Hill. Leatherhead is another place that could have been a source of inspiration for Highbury. There is a Randalls Road in the town, which is an important name within &quot;Emma&quot;. It has also been noted that there is a Mr Knightly mentioned in Leatherhead Church. Emma&#x27;s sister Isabella and her family live in Brunswick Square, between the City of London and the West End; the fields had just been transformed at the turn of the century into terraces of Georgian houses. Richmond, where Frank Churchill&#x27;s aunt and uncle settle in the summer, is now part of the Greater London area, but was then a separate town in Surrey.

Most of the other places mentioned are in southern England, such as the seaside resort towns of Weymouth, Dorset, Southend, and Cromer in Norfolk. Box Hill is still a place of beauty, popular for picnics. Bath, where Mr Elton went to find a bride, is a well-known spa city in the southwest. The place furthest away is the fictional Enscombe, the estate of the Churchills, in the real Yorkshire, in the north.

The school is based on Reading Abbey Girls&#x27; School, which Austen and her sister attended briefly:
not of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systems – and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity – but a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Emma&quot; has been the subject of many adaptations for film, TV, radio and the stage. The profusion of adaptations based on Jane Austen&#x27;s novels has not only created a large fan base today but has also sparked extensive scholarly examination on both the process and effect of modernizing the narratives and moving them between mediums. Examples of this critical, academic work can be found in texts such as &quot;Recreating Jane Austen&quot; by John Wiltshire, &quot;Jane Austen in Hollywood&quot; edited by Troost and Greenfield, &quot;Jane Austen and Co.: Remaking the Past in Contemporary Culture&quot; edited by Pucci and Thompson, and &quot;Adapting Jane Austen: The Surprising Fidelity of &#x27;Clueless&#x27;&quot; by William Galperin to name a few.

<text>An economist is a professional and practitioner in the social science discipline of economics.

The individual may also study, develop, and apply theories and concepts from economics and write about economic policy. Within this field there are many sub-fields, ranging from the broad philosophical theories to the focused study of minutiae within specific markets, macroeconomic analysis, microeconomic analysis or financial statement analysis, involving analytical methods and tools such as econometrics, statistics, economics computational models, financial economics, regulatory impact analysis and mathematical economics.

==Professions==

Economists work in many fields including academia, government and in the private sector, where they may also &quot;study data and statistics in order to spot trends in economic activity, economic confidence levels, and consumer attitudes. They assess this information using advanced methods in statistical analysis, mathematics, computer programming [and] they make recommendations about ways to improve the efficiency of a system or take advantage of trends as they begin.&quot; In addition to government and academia, economists are also employed in banking, finance, accountancy, commerce, marketing, business administration, lobbying and non- or not-for profit organizations.

In many organizations, an &quot;Economic Analyst&quot; is a formalized role. Professionals here are employed (or engaged as consultants) to conduct research, prepare reports, or formulate plans and strategies to address economic problems. Here, as outlined, the analyst provides forecasts, analysis and advice, based upon observed trends and economic principles; this entails also collecting and processing economic and statistical data using econometric methods and statistical techniques. 
* Economic analysts employed in financial institutions and in other large corporates, provide the (long term) economic forecasts used within their organizations. Relatedly, they consult to fund managers, risk managers, and corporate analysts re their investment strategy / capital budgeting decisions. Particularly in the tech sector, the focus may be microeconomic, addressing pricing, competition, and customer behavior. Re. either perspective, (chief) economists are also often included in strategy formulation.
* In the public sector, analysts advise legislators and executives on economic policy, public works, and related; politicians often consult economists before enacting economic policy; and many statesmen have academic degrees in economics. A Federal Government Economic Analyst conducts economic analysis of issues directly related to the function of their federal government agency.

In contrast to regulated professions such as engineering, law or medicine, there is not a legally required educational requirement or license for economists. In academia, most economists have a Ph.D. degree in Economics. In the U.S. Government, on the other hand, a person can be hired as an economist provided that they have a degree that included or was supplemented by 21 semester hours in economics and three hours in statistics, accounting, or calculus. In fact, a professional working inside of one of many fields of economics or having an academic degree in this subject is often considered to be an economist; see Bachelor of Economics and Master of Economics.

==By country==
Economics graduates are employable in varying degrees depending on the regional economic scenario and labour market conditions at the time for a given country. Apart from the specific understanding of the subject, employers value the skills of numeracy and analysis, the ability to communicate and the capacity to grasp broad issues which the graduates acquire at the university or college. Whilst only a few economics graduates may be expected to become professional economists, many find it a base for entry into a career in finance – including accounting, insurance, tax and banking, or management.

A number of economics graduates from around the world have been successful in obtaining employment in a variety of major national and international firms in the financial and commercial sectors, and in manufacturing, retailing and IT, as well as in the public sector – for example, in the health and education sectors, or in government and politics. Some graduates go on to undertake postgraduate studies, either in economics, research, teacher training or further qualifications in specialist areas.

===Brazil===
Unlike most nations, the economist profession in Brazil is regulated by law; specifically, Law № 1,411, of August 13, 1951. The professional designation of an economist, according to said law, is exclusive to those who graduated with a Bachelor of Economics degree in Brazil.

===United States===

According to the United States Department of Labor, there were about 15,000 non-academic economists in the United States in 2008, with a median salary of roughly $83,000, and the top ten percent earning more than $147,040 annually. Nearly 135 colleges and universities grant around 900 new Ph.D.s every year. Incomes are highest for those in the private sector, followed by the federal government, with academia paying the lowest incomes. As of January 2013, PayScale.com showed Ph.D. economists&#x27; salary ranges as follows: all Ph.D. economists, $61,000 to $160,000; Ph.D. corporate economists, $71,000 to $207,000; economics full professors, $89,000 to $137,000; economics associate professors, $59,000 to $156,000, and economics assistant professors, $72,000 to $100,000.

===United Kingdom===
The largest single professional grouping of economists in the UK are the more than 3500 members of the Government Economic Service.

Analysis of destination surveys for economics graduates from a number of selected top schools of economics in the United Kingdom (ranging from Newcastle University to the London School of Economics), shows nearly 80 percent in employment six months after graduation – with a wide range of roles and employers, including regional, national and international organisations, across many sectors.

<text>Nukualofa ( , ) is the capital and largest city of Tonga. It is located on the north coast of the island of Tongatapu, in the country&#x27;s southernmost island group.

==History==

===First western records of Nukualofa===
On 10 June 1777, British captain James Cook wrote of his arrival at their anchorage place. His description of the place confirmed, with his map, that this was the bay of Nukualofa.

Cook never used the name Nukualofa or any alternative spelling for the reports of this voyage, but he mentioned the island of Pangaimodoo (Pangaimotu) which was to the east of his anchorage position. Captain Cook also wrote that he travelled by canoes to visit Mooa (Mua) where Paulaho and other great men lived. The house that Paulaho provided was on the beach from the ship. Reference to his map shows that he must have landed and stayed in the Siesia area, the eastern part of modern Nukualofa. Cook also drafted the first map of the bay of Nukuʻalofa.

The first written record for Nukuʻalofa is stated in the first dedicated book for Tonga by George Vason which was published in 1810. George Vason was an English missionary from the London Missionary Society, who arrived in Tonga in 1797. George Vason wrote of their arrival that:

::&quot;Before we could well come to an anchor, the ship was surrounded by the natives, who flocked to us from every adjacent Island. The place, before which we anchored, was called Noogollefa: it was near an Island, named Bonghy-moddoo; on which former navigators pitched their tents, as a convenient spot, on account of its separation from the main Island, to preserve themselves from being too much incommoded by the natives.&quot;

That was the first mention of Nukuʻalofa, spelled as Noogoollefa. Vason&#x27;s unusual spelling of Nukuʻalofa and Pangaimotu (as &quot;Bonghy-Moddoo&quot;) was because the standard Tongan alphabet would not be developed until 1826–27.

The second oldest book dedicated to Tonga was by William Mariner, adopted son of Fīnau ʻUlukālala, which was published in 1817. Mariner described his experiences during the years he was the adopted son of ʻUlukālala (1806–1810). He described the civil war and the siege of the Fort of Nukuʻalofa, which fell to ʻUlukālala and his warriors.

The third attempt of Christian missionaries was recorded in April 1826, when two Tahitian London Missionaries were detained by Tupou the chief of Nukuʻalofa.

::In March 1826, the four men left Tahiti in the Minerva, their destination Fiji. But at Nukuʻalofa, Tonga, their plans were disrupted by the high chief Tupou (Aleamotuʻa). From Davies&#x27; perspective the Tahitian were placed under detention at Tongatapu: &quot;The chief called Tupou would not let them proceed. He had been himself a resident in Lageba and calls himself the friend of Tuineau, the chief of Lageba and as such he took possession of the present intended for the Fijian chief&quot;.

The arrival of the Methodist missionaries in Nukuʻalofa in 1827 reinforced the Christian faith. The persecution suffered by Christians in Hihifo and Hahake forced a lot of people to seek refuge in Nukuʻalofa. As a result of the encouragement of Tupou, the King of Nukuʻalofa, this was the beginning of the expanding of Nukuʻalofa to become the major center of Christianity in Tonga.

The US Exploring Expedition met with King Josiah (Aleamotuʻa) in 1840.

The final phase of the arrival of Christianity in Tonga was the arrival of Father Chevron, or Patele Sevelo, in 1842. He wrote that he arrived in Nukuʻalofa in 1842 and met the Tuʻi Kanokupolu Aleamotuʻa who was baptised by the Wesleyan as Sosaia.

In conclusion, these landings turned Nukuʻalofa from a small village and fort into the center of Tonga during the introduction of Christianity. From the earliest records for Nukuʻalofa, early writers always referred to the settlement as Noogollefa (1797), Nioocalofa (1806), Nukualofa (1826 by Methodist) and Noukou-Alofa (1842 by French Catholic priests). There was no other mention of any other name of the settlement other than the settlement or fort of Nukuʻalofa.

===Capital of the Kingdom of Tonga (1875 and later)===

The Declaration of the Constitution of Tonga in 1875 formalised Nukuʻalofa as the Capital of Tonga. King George Taufaʻahau Tupou I issued the Constitution of Tonga on 4 November 1875, in Nukuʻalofa. The Constitution also stated (Article 38) that the Parliament will meet in Nukuʻalofa except in time of war.

Since Nukuʻalofa has been expanding from when it became the center of Christianity in Tonga in the 19th century, it became essential that it was reorganised for effective administration of the capital. The reorganisation of Nukuʻalofa divided up Nukuʻalofa into three major district areas:
* Kolomotuʻa (&quot;Kolo&quot; meaning &quot;town&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;, &quot;motuʻa&quot; meaning &quot;old&quot;), encompassing the city&#x27;s original settlement at the old fort of Nukualofa, including the area of Tavatuʻutolu (Longolongo), Sopu ʻo Vave (now Sopu ʻo Taufaʻahau), Tongataʻeapa, Tufuenga, Kapeta and all the western area where it was the traditional settlement of the Tuʻi Kanokupolu from Mumui the 13th Tuʻi Kanokupolu to Aleamotuʻa the 18th Tuʻi Kanokupolu.
* Kolofoʻou (&quot;foʻou&quot; meaning &quot;new&quot;). This area started from the Vahaʻakolo Road and all the eastern side to Maʻufanga which include the Palace of King George Taufaʻahau Tupou I and seat of Government, as well as all the new settlement of Fasi moe Afi ʻa Tungi, Malie Taha (One Mile), Ngeleʻia was an old settlement during the civil wars and Taufaʻahau and his warriors destroy this settlement. Taufaʻahau settled in his kau Toʻa Tautahi (Sea-Warlords) in Nukuʻalofa for his protection and security from enemies and named the area Kolofoʻou (Newtown or Newsettling). This happened after the burn down and fall of Takai&#x27;s fortress of Pea in the command of his son Moeakiola in 1852. About the same time Taufaʻahau moved his capital to Kolofoʻou, Nukuʻalofa after he ruled and reigned from Pangai, Haʻapai since 1845.
* Maʻufanga, on the eastern side of Nukualofa. Maʻufanga was an old village of the Haʻa Takalaua, which is the Estate of the Chief Fakafanua, now ruled by the Uhamaka family. George Vason mentioned that Maʻufanga was a refugees area during the civil war, where people could take shelter in time of hardship. Maʻufanga is the area facing Pangaimotu, where James Cook anchored, and where Paulaho built him a house on the beach, about from the ship.

=== 21st century ===
In 2006, lack of progress towards democracy resulted in riots in Nukuʻalofa. During the riots, much of the central business district was burned down.

The capital city was struck by the tsunami caused by the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai eruption. The city reportedly suffered significant damage from the tsunami, which may potentially take years to repair.

==Government==
The national government is based in Nukualofa. The parliament of Tonga meets there, and the Royal Palace is located near the city.

The name is said to have originated when Moungatonga, the 6th Tui Haatakalaua (King who governs the daily business of Tonga on behalf of the Tui Tonga or Sacred King of Tonga) sent his youngest son, Ngata (later to be 1st Tui Kanokupolu) as governor to Hihifo (Western side of Tongatapu). It was a difficult decision for Ngata as the Tuʻi Tonga and Tuʻi Haʻatakalaua have been unable to control Hihifo. Ngata had many reasons to fear for his life as his predecessors had been killed by the chiefs and people of Hihifo.

Between 12 and 13 February 2018, the Tongan Parliament House was destroyed by Cyclone Gita, a category 4 cyclone that hit the nation. As a result, the Parliament was moved to the Tongan National Centre, south of the city centre, and that parcel of land gazetted as a part of Nukuʻalofa.

==Climate==
Nukuʻalofa features a tropical rainforest climate (Af) under the Köppen climate classification. The area does experience noticeably wetter and drier periods during the year, but it does not have a true dry season month where monthly precipitation falls below . Temperatures are slightly warmer during January and February where average temperatures hover around than June and July where the average temperatures is roughly . Nukuʻalofa sees a little more than of precipitation annually. As the trade winds are almost permanent and cyclones are not rare in Nukuʻalofa, the climate is not equatorial but maritime trade-wind tropical climate.


==Economy==
Nukualofa is the economic hub of the country.

Peau Vavaʻu, an airline, had its head office in the Pacific Royale Hotel in Nukuʻalofa. The former Royal Tongan Airlines had its head office in the Royco Building in Nukualofa.

The city has markets and a central business district. Much of the central business district was destroyed during the 2006 Nukuʻalofa riots. Reconstruction started in 2008, funded by a US$55 million loan from China.

The city has a number of tourist hotels.

==Transport==


Nukualofa is the central hub for transport in Tonga.
Buses arrive and depart from the central bus station along Vuna Road close to the centre of town. Bus services are privately operated, and their drivers are free to set their own schedules. Fares are fixed by the government, with reduced rates for school children. The buses are usually filled to capacity. In addition, some schools and large hotels provide their own buses.

There are numerous taxis, also privately owned. Many people who own a car earn extra money by providing taxi services in their spare time. Taxi fares are also set by the government. Most families have their own car; few residents ride bicycles. There are no operational railways or trams in Tonga, although there was once a narrow-gauge railway from the lagoon to the wharf, which gave its name to Railway Road.

Nukualofa harbour is the only deep-water harbour of the island, which determined its selection as the site for the capital. For many years Vuna Wharf was the international harbour until it was destroyed by an earthquake in 1977. A new, much larger wharf was built towards Maufanga, named after Queen Sālote. Between these two wharves is the wharf numbered &#x27;42&#x27;, used by fishermen and inter-island ferries. It is the central hub for boats to the outer islands. There are usually two boats to ʻEua each day and two to Haʻapai and Vavaʻu each week. In addition to these regular services by shipping companies, private boat owners provide less regular services to smaller islands such as Nomuka and ʻEueiki.

Air transport is provided by Fuaamotu International Airport on the south side of Tongatapu, 34–37 km from Nuku&#x27;alofa .

<text>The Caribbean Community (abbreviated as CARICOM or CC) is an intergovernmental organisation that is a political and economic union of 15 member states (14 nation-states and one dependency) and five associated members throughout the Americas, The Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean. It has the primary objective to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and coordinate foreign policy. The organisation was established in 1973, by its four founding members signing the Treaty of Chaguaramas.

The secretariat headquarters is in Georgetown, Guyana. CARICOM has been granted the official United Nations General Assembly observer status.

== History ==
CARICOM, originally The Caribbean Community and Common Market, was established by the Treaty of Chaguaramas which took effect on 1 August 1973. Founding states were Barbados, Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.

The Caribbean Community superseded the 1965–1972 Caribbean Free Trade Association organised to provide a continued economic linkage between the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean after the dissolution of the West Indies Federation, which lasted from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962.

A revised Treaty of Chaguaramas established &quot;The Caribbean Community including the CARICOM Single Market and Economy&quot; and was signed by the CARICOM Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community on 5 July 2001 at their Twenty-Second Meeting of the Conference in Nassau, The Bahamas. The revised treaty cleared the way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into the Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy.

Haiti&#x27;s membership in CARICOM remained effectively suspended from 29 February 2004 through early June 2006 following the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état and the removal of Jean-Bertrand Aristide from the presidency. CARICOM announced that no democratically elected government in CARICOM should have its leader deposed. The fourteen other heads of government sought to have Aristide fly from Africa to Jamaica and share his account of events with them, which infuriated the interim Haitian prime minister, Gérard Latortue, who announced he would take steps to take Haiti out of CARICOM. CARICOM thus voted on suspending the participation of Haitian officials from the councils of CARICOM. Following the presidential election of René Préval, Haitian officials were readmitted and Préval himself gave the opening address at the CARICOM Council of Ministers meeting in July.

Since 2013 the CARICOM-bloc and with the Dominican Republic have been tied to the European Union via an Economic Partnership Agreements signed in 2008 known as CARIFORUM. The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment. Under Article 234 of the agreement, the European Court of Justice handles dispute resolution between CARIFORUM and European Union states.

== Agenda and goals ==
CARICOM was established by the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean and currently includes all the independent Anglophone island countries plus Belize, Guyana, Montserrat and Suriname, as well as all other British Caribbean territories and Bermuda as associate members. English was its sole working language into the 1990s. The organisation became multilingual with the addition of Dutch and Sranan Tongo-speaking Suriname in 1995 and the French and Haitian Creole-speaking Haiti in 2002. Furthermore, it added Spanish as the fourth official language in 2003. In July 2012, CARICOM announced they considered making French and Dutch official languages. In 2001, the Conference of Heads of Governments signed a revised Treaty of Chaguaramas that cleared the way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into the CARICOM Single Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty establishes and implements the Caribbean Court of Justice. Its primary activities involve:
* Coordinating economic policies and development planning.
* Devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction.
* Operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market).
* Handling regional trade disputes.

== Organisational structure ==
The following is the overall structure of Caribbean Community (CARICOM).

=== Administration and staff ===
=== Chairmanship ===
The post of Chairman (Head of CARICOM) is held in rotation by the regional Heads of Government of CARICOM&#x27;s 15 member states. These include Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Haiti, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, The Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago.

=== Heads of government ===
CARICOM contains a quasi-Cabinet of the individual Heads of Government. These heads are given specialised portfolios of responsibility for regional development and integration.

=== Secretariat ===
The Secretariat of the Caribbean Community is the Chief Administrative Organ for CARICOM. The Secretary-General of the Caribbean Community is the chief executive and handles foreign and community relations. Five years is the term of office of the Secretary-General, which may be renewed. The Deputy Secretary-General of the Caribbean Community handles human and Social Development. The General Counsel of the Caribbean Community handles trade and economic integration.

The goal statement of the CARICOM Secretariat is: &quot;To contribute, in support of Member States, to the improvement of the quality of life of the People of the Community and the development of an innovative and productive society in partnership with institutions and groups working towards attaining a people-centred, sustainable and internationally competitive Community.&quot;

=== Organs and bodies ===
==== Community Council ====
The Community Council comprises ministers responsible for community affairs and any other Minister designated by the member states at their discretion. It is one of the community&#x27;s principal organs; the other is the Conference of the Heads of Government. Four other organs and three bodies support it.

== Institutions ==
The following institutions are founded by or affiliated to the Caricom:

=== Caricom Institutions ===
=== Functional cooperation ===
=== Associate ===
=== Cancelled ===
The following institutions have been cancelled or merged into other ones:
== Relationship to other supranational Caribbean organisations ==

=== Association of Caribbean States ===
CARICOM was instrumental in the formation of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) on 24 July 1994. The original idea for the Association came from a recommendation of the West Indian Commission, established in 1989 by the CARICOM heads of state and government. The Commission advocated both deepening the integration process (through the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) and complementing it through a separate regional organisation encompassing all states in the Caribbean.

CARICOM accepted the commission&#x27;s recommendations and opened dialogue with other Caribbean states, the Central American states and the Latin American nations of Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico which border the Caribbean, for consultation on the proposals of the West Indian Commission.

At an October 1993 summit, the heads of state and government of CARICOM and the presidents of the then-Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) formally decided to create an association grouping all states of the Caribbean basin. A work schedule for its formation was adopted. The aim was to create the association in less than a year, an objective which was achieved with the formal creation of the ACS.

=== Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ===
CARICOM was also involved in the formation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) on 3 December 2010. The idea for CELAC originated at the Rio Group–Caribbean Community Unity Summit on 23 February 2010 in Mexico. This act caters to the integration of the Americas process, complimenting well-established initiatives of the Organization of American States.

=== European Union: Economic Partnership Agreements ===
Since 2013, the CARICOM-bloc and the Dominican Republic have been tied to the European Union via an Economic Partnership Agreements known as CARIFORUM signed in 2008. The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment. Within the agreement under Article 234, the European Court of Justice also carries dispute resolution mechanisms between CARIFORUM and the states of the European Union.

=== OHADAC Project ===
In May 2016, Caricom&#x27;s court of original jurisdiction, the CCJ, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the ACP Legal Association based in Guadeloupe recognising and supporting the goals of implementing a harmonised business law framework in the Caribbean through ACP Legal Association&#x27;s OHADAC Project.

OHADAC is the acronym for the French &quot;Organisation pour l&#x27;Harmonisation du Droit des Affaires en les Caraïbes&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in the Caribbean&quot;. The OHADAC Project takes inspiration from a similar organisation in Africa and aims to enhance economic integration across the entire Caribbean and facilitate increased trade and international investment through unified laws and alternative dispute resolution methods.

== Member states ==
 CARICOM has 15 full members, seven associate members and eight observers. The associated members are five British Overseas Territories, one constituent county of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and one  French Overseas Territory. It is currently not established what the role of the associate members will be. The observers are states which engage in at least one of CARICOM&#x27;s technical committees.

Under Article 4 CARICOM breaks its 15 member states into two groups: Less Developed Countries (LDCs) and More Developed Countries (MDCs).

The countries of CARICOM which are designated as Less Developed Countries (LDCs) are as follows:

* Antigua and Barbuda
* Belize
* Commonwealth of Dominica
* Grenada
* Republic of Haiti
* Montserrat
* Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis
* St Lucia
* St Vincent and the Grenadines

The countries of CARICOM which are designated as More Developed Countries (MDCs) are:

* Commonwealth of The Bahamas
* Barbados
* Co-operative Republic of Guyana
* Jamaica
* Republic of Suriname
* Republic of Trinidad and Tobago

Thousands of Caricom nationals live within other member states of the Community.

An estimated 30,000 Jamaicans legally reside in other CARICOM member states, mainly in The Bahamas (6,200), Antigua &amp; Barbuda (estimated 12,000), Barbados and Trinidad &amp; Tobago). Also, an estimated 150 Jamaicans live and work in Montserrat. A 21 November 2013 estimated put 16,958 Jamaicans residing illegally in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, as according to the records of the Office of the Chief Immigration Officer, their entry certificates would have since expired. By October 2014, the estimated Jamaicans residing illegally in Trinidad and Tobago was 19,000 along with an estimated 7,169 Barbadians and 25,884 Guyanese residing illegally. An estimated 8,000 Trinidadians and Tobagonians live in Jamaica.

Barbados hosts a large diaspora population of Guyanese, of whom (in 2005) 5,032 lived there permanently as citizens, permanent residents, immigrants (with immigrant status) and Caricom skilled nationals; 3,200 were residing in Barbados temporarily under work permits, as students, or with &quot;reside and work&quot; status. A further 2,000–3,000 Guyanese were estimated to be living illegally in Barbados at the time. Migration between Barbados and Guyana has deep roots, going back over 150 years, with the most intense period of Barbadian migration to then-British Guiana occurring between 1863 and 1886, although as late as the 1920s and 1930s Barbadians were still leaving Barbados for British Guiana.

Migration between Guyana and Suriname also goes back a number of years. An estimated 50,000 Guyanese had migrated to Suriname by 1986 In 1987 an estimated 30–40,000 Guyanese were in Suriname. Many Guyanese left Suriname in the 1970s and 1980s, either voluntarily or by expulsion. Citing a national security concern, over 5,000 were expelled in January 1985 alone. In the instability Suriname experienced following independence, both coups and civil war. In 2013, an estimated 11,530 Guyanese had emigrated to Suriname and 4,662 Surinamese to Guyana.

=== Relationship with Cuba ===
In 2017, the Republic of Cuba and CARICOM signed the &quot;CARICOM-Cuba Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement&quot; to facilitate closer trade ties. In December 2022, President of Cuba Miguel Díaz-Canel met in Bridgetown, Barbados with the Heads of State and Government of CARICOM. On the occasion of the 8th CARICOM-Cuba Summit to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations with the independent States of CARICOM and Cuba and the 20th Anniversary of CARICOM-Cuba Day. Cuba also accepted CARICOM&#x27;s offer to deepen bilateral cooperation and to join robust discussions in the bloc&#x27;s regional &#x27;Joint Ministerial Taskforce on Food production and Security&#x27;.

== Symbols ==
=== Standard ===
The flag of the Caribbean Community was chosen and approved in November 1983 at the Conference of Heads of Government Meeting in Port of Spain, Trinidad. The original design by the firm of WINART Studies in Georgetown, Guyana was substantially modified at the July 1983 Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government. The flag was first flown on 4 July 1984 in Nassau, The Bahamas at the fifth Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government.

The flag features a blue background, but the upper part is a light blue representing sky and the lower, a darker blue representing the Caribbean Sea. The yellow circle in the centre represents the sun on which is printed in black the logo of the Caribbean Community, two interlocking Cs. The two Cs are in the form of broken links in a chain, symbolising both unity and a break with the colonial past. The narrow ring of green around the sun represents the vegetation of the region.

=== Song ===
For CARICOM&#x27;s 40th anniversary, a competition to compose an official song or anthem for CARICOM was launched in April 2013 to promote choosing a song that promoted unity and inspired CARICOM identity and pride. A regional panel of judges comprising independent experts in music was nominated by member states and the CARICOM Secretariat. Three rounds of competition condensed 63 entries to a final three, from which judges chose &quot;Celebrating CARICOM&quot; by Michele Henderson of Dominica in March 2014. Henderson won a US$10,000 prize. Her song was produced by her husband, Roland Delsol Jr., and arranged by Earlson Matthew. It also featured Michael Ferrol on drums and choral input from the St. Alphonsus Choir. It was re-produced for CARICOM by Carl Beaver Henderson of Trinidad and Tobago.

A second-place entry titled &quot;My CARICOM&quot; came from Jamaican Adiel Thomas who won US$5,000, and a third-place song titled &quot;One CARICOM&quot; by Carmella Lawrence of St. Kitts and Nevis, won US$2,500. The other songs from the top-ten finalists (in no particular order) were:

* &quot;One Region one Caribbean&quot; from Anguilla,
* &quot;One Caribbean Family&quot; from Jamaica,
* &quot;CARICOM’s Light&quot; from St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines,
* &quot;We Are CARICOM&quot; from Dominica,
* &quot;Together As one&quot; from Dominica,
* &quot;Blessed CARICOM&quot; from Jamaica,
* &quot;Together We Rise&quot; from Jamaica.

The first official performance of &quot;Celebrating CARICOM&quot; by Henderson took place on Tuesday 1 July 2014 at the opening ceremony for the Thirty-Fifth Regional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government in Antigua and Barbuda.

=== Celebration ===
==== CARICOM Day ====
The celebration of CARICOM Day is the selected day some Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries officially recognise the commemorative date of signing of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, the agreement that established CARICOM on 4 July 1973. The Treaty was signed in Chaguaramas, Trinidad &amp; Tobago by then leaders of: Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. CARICOM Day is recognised as an official public holiday in Guyana where the secretariat is based, and is observed on the first Monday of July. The government of Antigua and Barbuda has also implemented CARICOM Day as a holiday.

The day features activities that are organised by government entities such as parades, pageants, and campaigns to educate people about CARICOM.

=== Caribbean Festival of Arts – CARIFESTA ===

Caribbean Festival of Arts, commonly known as CARIFESTA, is an annual festival for promoting arts of the Caribbean with a different country hosting the event each year. It was started to provide a venue to &quot;depict the life of the people of the Region, their heroes, morals, myths, traditions, beliefs, creativity and ways of expression&quot; by fostering a sense of Caribbean unity, and motivating artists by showing the best of their home country. It began under the auspices of Guyana&#x27;s then President Forbes Burnham in 1972, who was inspired by other singular arts festivals in the region.

<doc id="57361" wikidata="Q3306" url="?curid=57361" title="Panama City">
<text>Panama City, also known as Panama (or Panamá in Spanish), is the capital and largest city of Panama. It has a total population of 1,086,990, with over 2,100,000 in its metropolitan area. The city is located at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal, in the province of Panama. The city is the political and administrative center of the country, as well as a hub for banking and commerce.

The city of Panama was founded on 15 August 1519, by Spanish conquistador Pedro Arias Dávila. The city was the starting point for expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire of Peru. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the American continent, leading to the fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo, through which passed most of the gold and silver that Spain mined from the Americas.

On 28 January 1671, the original city was destroyed by a fire when the privateer Henry Morgan sacked and set fire to it. The city was formally reestablished two years later on 21 January 1673, on a peninsula located from the original settlement. The site of the previously devastated city is still in ruins, and is now a World Heritage Site and popular tourist attraction, regularly visited by school trips.

==History==



The city was founded on 15 August 1519, by Pedro Arias de Ávila, also known as Pedrarias Dávila. Within a few years of its founding, the city became a launching point for the exploration and conquest of Peru and a transit point for gold and silver headed back to Spain through the Isthmus. The Genoese-Italians and the Spanish encountered coconuts from the Philippines which the Malayo-Polynesians brought before Spanish colonization. In 1520, Genoese merchants controlled the port and the commerce of the region, mainly for the slave trade, thanks to a concession given by the Spaniards, who had the Republic of Genoa as its main banking base.

In 1671 Henry Morgan with a band of 1,400 men attacked and looted the city, which was subsequently destroyed by fire. The ruins of the old city still remain and are a popular tourist attraction known as Panamá Viejo (Old Panama). The city was rebuilt in 1673 in a new location approximately southwest of the original city. This location is now known as the Casco Viejo (Old Quarter) of the city. Panama City is the fourth earliest-founded of the modern-day capital cities in the Americas.

One year before the start of the California Gold Rush, the Panama Railroad Company was formed, but the railroad did not begin full operation until 1855. Between 1848 and 1869, the year the first transcontinental railroad was completed in the United States, about 375,000 people crossed the isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and 225,000 in the opposite direction. This traffic greatly increased the prosperity of the city during that period.

After declaring independence from Colombia on 3 November 1903, Philippe Bunau-Varilla (a French engineer) was named Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. Bunau-Varilla negotiated the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, which provided the United States with a 10-mile-wide strip of land for the canal, a one-time $10 million payment to Panama, and an annual annuity of $250,000. The United States also agreed to guarantee the independence of Panama. Completed in 1914, the Panama Canal symbolized U.S. technological prowess and economic power. Although U.S. control of the canal eventually became an irritant to U.S.-Panamanian relations, at the time it was heralded as a major foreign policy achievement.

The construction of the Panama Canal was of great benefit to the infrastructure and economy. Of particular note are the improvements in health and sanitation brought about by the American presence in the Canal Zone. William Gorgas, the chief sanitary officer for the canal construction, had a particularly large impact. He hypothesized that diseases were spread by the abundance of mosquitos native to the area, and ordered the fumigation of homes and the cleansing of water. This led to yellow fever being eradicated by November 1905, as well malaria rates falling dramatically. However, most of the laborers for the construction of the canal were brought in from the Caribbean, which created unprecedented racial and social tensions in the city.

During World War II, construction of military bases and the presence of larger numbers of U.S. military and civilian personnel brought about unprecedented levels of prosperity to the city. Panamanians had limited access, or no access at all, to many areas in the Canal Zone neighboring the Panama city metropolitan area. Some of these areas were military bases accessible only to United States personnel. Some tensions arose between the people of Panama and the U.S. citizens living in the Panama Canal Zone. This erupted in the 9 January 1964, events, known as Martyrs&#x27; Day.

In the late 1970s through the 1980s the city of Panama became an international banking center, bringing a lot of undesirable attention as an international money-laundering locale. In 1989 after nearly a year of tension between the United States and Panama, President George H. W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama to depose General Manuel Noriega, the country&#x27;s de facto dictator. As a result, a portion of the El Chorrillo neighborhood, which consisted mostly of old wood-framed buildings dating back to the 1900s (though still a large slum area), was destroyed by fire. In 1999, the United States officially transferred full control of the Panama Canal to the Republic of Panama, which remains in control today.

The city of Panama is still a banking center, although with very visible controls in the flow of cash. Shipping is handled through port facilities in the area of Balboa operated by the Hutchison Whampoa Company of Hong Kong and through several ports on the Caribbean side of the isthmus. Balboa, which is located within the greater Panama metropolitan area, was formerly part of the Panama Canal Zone, and the administration of the former Panama Canal Zone was headquartered there.

==Geography==

Panamá is located between the Pacific Ocean and tropical rain forest in the northern part of Panama. The &quot;Parque Natural Metropolitano&quot; (Metropolitan Nature Park), stretching from Panama City along the Panama Canal, has unique bird species and other animals, such as tapir, puma, and caimans. At the Pacific entrance of the canal is the &quot;Centro de Exhibiciones Marinas&quot; (Marine Exhibitions Center), a research center for those interested in tropical marine life and ecology, managed by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.

Tropical forests around Panama are vital for the functioning of the Panama Canal, providing it with the water required for its operation. Due to the canal&#x27;s importance to the Panamanian economy, tropical forests around the canal have been kept in an almost pristine state; the canal is thus a rare example of a vast engineering project in the middle of a forest that helped to preserve that forest. Along the western side of the canal is the &quot;Parque Nacional Soberanía&quot; (Sovereignty National Park), which includes the Summit botanical gardens and a zoo. The best known trail in this national park is Pipeline Road, popular among birdwatchers.

Nearly 500 rivers lace Panama&#x27;s rugged landscape. Most are unnavigable; many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the Río Chepo and the Río Chagres, both within the boundaries of the city, work as sources of hydroelectric power.

The Río Chagres is one of the longest and most vital of the approximately 150 rivers that flow into the Caribbean. Part of this river was dammed to create Gatun Lake, which forms a major part of the transit route between the locks near each end of the canal. Both Gatun Lake and Madden Lake (also filled with water from the Río Chagres) provide hydroelectricity to the former Canal Zone area. The Río Chepo, another major source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Panama City has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;), a little drier than a tropical monsoon climate. It sees of precipitation annually. The wet season spans from May through December, and the dry season spans from January through April. Temperatures remain constant throughout the year, averaging around . Sunshine is subdued in Panama because it lies in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where there is a nearly continual cloud formation, even during the dry season.

==Cityscape==

===Architecture===
Panama&#x27;s old quarter (or Casco Viejo, Panama) features many architectural styles, from Spanish colonial buildings to French and Antillean townhouses built during the construction of the Panama Canal. The more modern areas of the city have many high-rise buildings, which together form a very dense skyline. There are more than 110 high-rise projects under construction, with 127 already built. The city holds the 45th place in the world by high-rise buildings count.

The Centennial Bridge that crosses the Panama Canal earned the American Segmental Bridge Institute prize of excellence, along with seven other bridges in the Americas.

===Neighborhoods===
The city is located in Panama District, although its metropolitan area also includes some populated areas on the opposite side of the Panama Canal. As in the rest of the country, the city is divided into &quot;corregimientos&quot;, in which there are many smaller boroughs. The old quarter, known as the &quot;Casco Viejo&quot;, is located in the &quot;corregimiento&quot; of San Felipe. San Felipe and twelve other &quot;corregimientos&quot; form the urban center of the city, including Santa Ana, El Chorrillo, Calidonia, Curundú, Ancón, Bella Vista, Bethania, San Francisco, Juan Diaz, Pueblo Nuevo, Parque Lefevre, and Río Abajo.

==Economy==


As the economic and financial center of the country, Panama City&#x27;s economy is service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce, and tourism. The economy depends significantly on trade and shipping activities associated with the Panama Canal and port facilities located in Balboa. Panama&#x27;s status as a convergence zone for capital from around the world due to the canal helped the city establish itself as a prime location for offshore banking and tax planning. Consequently, the economy has relied on accountants and lawyers who help global corporations navigate the regulatory landscape. The city has benefited from significant economic growth in recent years, mainly due to the ongoing expansion of the Panama Canal, an increase in real estate investment, and a relatively stable banking sector. There are around eighty banks in the city, at least fifteen of which are local.

Panama City is responsible for the production of approximately 55% of the country&#x27;s GDP. This is because most Panamanian businesses and premises are located in the city and its metro area. It is a stopover for other destinations in the country, as well as a transit point and tourist destination in itself.

Tourism is one of the most important economic activities in terms of revenue generation. This sector of the economy has seen a great deal of growth since the transfer of the Panama Canal Zone at the end of the twentieth century. The number of hotel rooms increased by more than ten-fold, from 1,400 in 1997 to more than 15,000 in 2013, while the number of annual visitors increased from 457,000 in 1999 to 1.4 million in 2011. The city&#x27;s hotel occupancy rate has always been relatively high, reaching the second highest for any city outside the United States in 2008, after Perth, Australia, and followed by Dubai. However, hotel occupancy rates have dropped since 2009, probably due to the opening of many new luxury hotels. Several international hotel chains, such as Le Méridien, Radisson, and RIU, have opened or plan to open new hotels in the city, along with those previously operating under Marriott, Sheraton, InterContinental, and other foreign and local brands. The Trump Organization built the Trump Ocean Club, its first investment in Latin America, in 2006 and it is the tallest building in the city. In 2018 it was renamed The Bahia Grand Panama following falling occupancy rates associated with the declining brand value of the Trump name. Meanwhile, it is a JW Marriott property. Hilton Worldwide opened a Hilton Garden Inn in El Cangrejo, and in 2013, The Panamera, the second Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Latin America.

Land reclamation projects have created additional new land for highways, housing, and parkland developments, Cinta Costera. 

==Demographics==

The city proper has approximately 1,086,990 inhabitants in 26 boroughs. The inhabitants of Panama City are commonly referred to as &quot;capitalinos&quot; and include large numbers of mestizos (70%), Amerindian and mixed people (West Indian) (14%), white people (10%), Amerindians (6%), as well as Afro-Panamanians. There is a great deal of cultural diversity within the city, which manifests itself in the wide variety of languages commonly spoken, such as German, Portuguese, French, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew and English, in addition to Spanish.

===World Heritage Sites===
====Panamá Viejo====
Panamá Viejo (&quot;Old Panama&quot;) is the name used for the architectural vestiges of the Monumental Historic Complex of the first Spanish city founded on the Pacific coast of the Americas by Pedro Arias de Ávila on 15 August 1519. This city was the starting point for the expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru in 1532. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the history of the American continent, leading to the famous fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo, where most of the gold and silver that Spain took from the Americas passed through.

====Casco Viejo or Casco Antiguo====
Built and settled in 1671 after the destruction of Panama Viejo by the privateer Henry Morgan, the historic district of Panama City (known as Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo or San Felipe) was conceived as a walled city to protect its settlers against future pirate attacks. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2003.

Casco Antiguo displays a mix of architectural styles that reflect the country&#x27;s cultural diversity: Caribbean, Republican, art deco, French, and colonial architecture mix in a site comprising around 800 buildings. Most of Panama City&#x27;s main monuments are located in Casco Antiguo, including the Salón Bolivar, the National Theater (founded in 1908), Las Bóvedas, and Plaza de Francia. There are also many Catholic buildings, such as the Metropolitan Cathedral, the La Merced Church, and the St. Philip Neri Church. The distinctive golden altar at St. Joseph Church was one of the few items saved from Panama Viejo during the 1671 pirate siege. It was buried in mud during the siege and then secretly transported to its present location.

; The Cinta Costera 3 in Casco Viejo
Undergoing redevelopment and gentrification, the old quarter has become one of the city&#x27;s main tourist attractions, second only to the Panama Canal. Both government and private sectors are working on its restoration. President Ricardo Martinelli built an extension to the Cinta Costera maritime highway viaduct in 2014 named &quot;Cinta Costera 3&quot; around the Casco Antiguo.

Before the Cinta Costera 3 project was built there were protests. Much of the controversy surrounding the project involved the possibility that Casco Viejo would lose its World Heritage status. On 28 June 2012, UNESCO decided that Casco Viejo will not be put on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. 

===Literature===

According to Professor Rodrigo Miró, the first story about Panama was written by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés and published as part of the &quot;Historia General y Natural de Las Indias&quot; in 1535. Some authors born in Panamá city are Manuel María Ayala (1785–1824), Amelia Denis de Icaza (1836–1911), Darío Herrera (1870–1914), Ricardo Miró (1883–1940), Gaspar Octavio Hernández (1893–1918), Demetrio Korsi (1899–1957), Ricardo Bermúdez (1914–2000), Joaquín Beleño (1921–88), Ernesto Endara (1932–), Diana Morán (1932–87), Rosa María Britton (1936-2019), José Córdova (1937–), Pedro Rivera (1939–), Moravia Ochoa López (1941–), Roberto Fernández Iglesias (1941–), Juan David Morgan (1942 –), Jarl Ricardo Babot (1946–), Giovanna Benedetti (1949–), Édgar Soberón Torchia (1951-), Manuel Orestes Nieto (1951–), Moisés Pascual (1955–), Nyra Soberón Torchia (1955-), Héctor Miguel Collado (1960–), David Robinson Orobio (1960–), Katia Chiari (1969–), Carlos Oriel Wynter Melo (1971–), José Luis Rodríguez Pittí (1971–), Arturo Wong Sagel (1980–) and Sofía Santim (1982–).

===Art===
One of the most important Panamanian artists is Alfredo Sinclair. He has worked for over 50 years in abstract art and has produced one of the most important artistic collections in the country. His daughter, Olga Sinclair, has also followed in his footsteps and has become another force in Panamanian art. Another very prominent Panamanian artist is Guillermo Trujillo, known worldwide for his abstract surrealism.
Brooke Alfaro is a Panamanian artist known throughout the world for his uniquely rendered oil paintings.
Another prominent artist is Mario Calvit, known as one of the great painters of the generation that flourished in the country between the decades of 1950 and 1970.

===Tourism===
Tourism in Panama City includes many different historic sites and locations related to the operation of the Panama Canal. A few of these sites are the following: 
* &quot;Las Bóvedas&quot; (&quot;The Vaults&quot;), a waterfront promenade jutting out into the Pacific;
* The National Institute of Culture Building and the French embassy across from it;
* The Cathedral at &quot;Plaza de la Catedral&quot;;
* &quot;Teatro Nacional&quot; (National Theatre of Panama), an intimate performance center with outstanding natural acoustics and seating for about 800 guests;
* &quot;Museo del Canal Interoceánico&quot; (Interoceanic Canal Museum); and
* &quot;Palacio de las Garzas&quot; (Heron&#x27;s Palace), the official name of the presidential palace, named for the numerous herons that inhabit the building.
* &quot;Miraflores Visitors Center&quot; at the Miraflores set of Locks on the Pacific Side, with a museum and a simulator of a ship cruising the canal.
* Calzada de Amador (Amador Causeway), a land-bridge built with rocks excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal.
In addition to these tourist attractions, Panama City offers many different options when it comes to hotel accommodations, including the first Waldorf Astoria hotel to open in Latin America, and many small boutique style hotels that have smaller numbers of guest rooms and offer a more intimate vacation. Nightlife in the city is centered around the Calle Uruguay and Casco Viejo neighborhoods. These neighborhoods contain a variety of different bars and nightclubs that cater to the tourists visiting the city.

One of the newer tourist areas of the city is the area immediately east of the Pacific entrance of the canal, known as the Amador Causeway. This area is being developed as a tourist center and nightlife destination. The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute operates a station and a small museum open to the public at Culebra Point on the island of Naos. A new museum, the Biomuseo, was recently completed on the causeway in 2014. It was designed by the American architect Frank Gehry, famous for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Just outside the city limits is the Parque Municipal Summit. A new convention center called the Amador Convention Center is being built in Amador by CSCEC in a joint venture with a Panamanian company called CCG Cocige. The Panamanian ministry of Tourism hopes for the convention center to house 100 international events annually. There were plans (proposed by Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela) to build in Amador a campus for the embassy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in Panama, however the plans were eventually dropped, due to criticism from the general public and fears that tourists could easily assume that Panama was Chinese territory. Varela in response said that Amador is an area that &quot;must have more value&quot;.

The United States State Department notes the presence of crimes in the city, some of which include violent acts such as shootings, rape, armed robbery, and intentional kidnapping. The United States State Department also warns tourists about the purchasing of counterfeited or pirated goods, as they may be in violation of local Panamanian laws. In terms of LGBT rights in the city, same sex marriage is not recognized by the government but there are laws in place to prevent discrimination against the LGBT community.

==Sports==
Throughout the 20th century, Panama City has excelled in boxing, baseball, basketball, and soccer. These sports have produced famous athletes such as Roberto Durán, Rommel Fernández, Rolando Blackman, Julio Dely Valdés, Mariano Rivera, and Rod Carew. Today, these sports have clubs and associations that manage their development in the city. Panama Metro is the city&#x27;s baseball team. There are boxing training centers in different gyms throughout the city&#x27;s neighborhoods. There are also many football clubs, such as:
* Alianza
* Chorrillo
* Plaza Amador
* Tauro
* Chepo
* San Francisco F.C.
The city has four professional teams in the country&#x27;s second-level league, Liga Nacional de Ascenso:
* Atlético Nacional
* Deportivo Genesis
* Millenium
* Río Abajo

There are two main stadiums in Panama City, the National Baseball Stadium (also known as Rod Carew Stadium) and the Rommel Fernández Stadium, with capacities of 27,000 and 32,000 respectively. Additionally, the Roberto Durán Arena has a capacity of 18,000.

==Education==

The city has both public and private schools. Most private schools are bilingual (English and Spanish). Higher education is headed by two major public universities: the University of Panama and the Technological University of Panama. There are private universities, such as the Universidad Católica Santa María La Antigua, the Universidad Latina de Panama, the Universidad Latinoamericana de Ciencia y Tecnología (ULACIT), the Distance and Open University of Panama (UNADP), Universidad del Istmo Panama, the Universidad Maritima Internacional de Panama, and the Universidad Especializada de las Americas.

==Transportation==


Panama&#x27;s international airport, Tocumen International Airport is located on the eastern outskirts of the city&#x27;s metropolitan area. Two other airports serve Panama City: Panamá Pacífico, previously the Howard Air Force Base, and Marcos A. Gelabert, previously the Albrook Air Force Base. Pacífico serves Wingo, while Marcos A. Gelabert Airport is the main hub for AirPanama. Most other flights are served by Tocumen.

The Panama Metro is a rapid transit system in Panama City, which links the north and east sides of the metropolitan area to the city center. The Panama Metro currently has two operating lines. There is a third line currently under construction.

There are frequent traffic jams in Panama City due to the high levels of private transport ownership per kilometer of traffic lane. In an attempt to curb traffic jams, the Panama Metro, initially long and funded an increase in taxes, began operation in 2014.

The bus terminal located in Ancon offers buses in and out of the city. Bus service is one of the most widely used forms of transportation in Panama. The terminal receives thousands of passengers daily from locations like David, Chiriqui, and the central provinces of Herrera and Los Santos. The terminal also receives international passengers from Central America via the Pan-American Highway.

Panama City offers transportation services through yellow taxis. Taxis do not use a meter to measure fares, instead using a zone system for fares that is published by the Autoridad de Transito y Transporte Terrestre, Panama&#x27;s transit authority. Taxis used to be red. Taxi drivers that charge more than usual are not uncommon. Many also participate in InDriver and Cabify. Uber has been the subject of controversy, with many taxi drivers demanding its cessation of operations in Panama City.

==International relations==

Panama City is twinned with:

* Charleston, United States
* Davao City, Philippines
* Fort Lauderdale, United States
* Guadalajara, Mexico
* Imabari, Japan
* Incheon, South Korea
* Kaohsiung, Taiwan
* Liverpool, England, United Kingdom
* Madrid, Spain
* Medellín, Colombia

<text>Paramaribo ( , , ) is the capital and largest city of Suriname, located on the banks of the Suriname River in the Paramaribo District. Paramaribo has a population of roughly 241,000 people (2012 census), almost half of Suriname&#x27;s population. The historic inner city of Paramaribo has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2002.

== Name ==
The city is named for the Paramaribo tribe living at the mouth of the Suriname River; the name is from Tupi–Guarani &quot;para&quot; &quot;large river&quot; + &quot;maribo&quot; &quot;inhabitants&quot;.

== History ==
The name Paramaribo is probably a corruption of the name of a native village, spelled Parmurbo in the earliest Dutch sources. This was the location of the first Dutch settlement, a trading post established by Nicolaes Baliestel and Dirck Claeszoon van Sanen in 1613. English and French traders also tried to establish settlements in Suriname, including a French post established in 1644 near present-day Paramaribo.

All earlier settlements were abandoned some time before the arrival of English settlers in 1650 to found Surinam. They were sent by the English governor of Barbados, Lord Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham, and established a town on the site of Paramaribo (though probably south of the current town center). The town was protected by a fort, called Fort Willoughby. In 1662, Governor Willoughby was granted the settlement and surrounding lands (extending into Suriname&#x27;s interior) by King Charles II. Around 1665 the village of Paramaribo was expanded and quickly outranked the earlier settlement of Torarica.

In 1667, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Paramaribo was conquered by a squadron of ships under Abraham Crijnssen. The Treaty of Breda in 1667 confirmed Paramaribo as the leading town of the now Dutch colony of Suriname. The fort protecting Paramaribo was renamed Fort Zeelandia in honor of the Dutch province that had financed Crijnssen&#x27;s fleet. (The town was also renamed New Middelburg but the name did not catch on with the inhabitants).

The population of Paramaribo has always been very diverse. Among the first British settlers were many Jews and one of the oldest synagogues in the Americas, the Neveh Shalom Synagogue, is found in Paramaribo. The population of the town was greatly increased after 1873, when former enslaved people (who had been freed in 1863) were allowed to stop working for their former masters and leave the sugar plantations.

Paramaribo has remained the capital of Suriname, from its colonial days through the independence of Suriname in 1975 to the present day. The old town has suffered many devastating fires over the years, notably in January 1821 (which destroyed over 400 buildings) and September 1832 (which destroyed nearly 50 buildings). The slaves Kodjo, Mentor, and Present were found guilty of arson, and burnt alive.

In May 1972, the Paramaribo Zoo opened. In 1987, an administrative reorganization took place in Suriname and the city was divided into 12 administrative resorts (jurisdictions).

== Geography ==

The city is located on the Suriname River, approximately inland from the Atlantic Ocean, in the Paramaribo district.

=== Climate ===
Paramaribo features a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;), under the Köppen climate classification. Because Paramaribo is more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and sees no tropical cyclones, its climate is classified as equatorial. The city has no true dry season; all 12 months of the year average more than of rainfall, but the city does experience noticeably wetter and drier periods during the year. The northern hemisphere &quot;autumn&quot; (September through November) is the driest period of the year in Paramaribo, and the heaviest rainfall occurs from April to July. Common to many cities with this climate, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course of the year, with average high temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius and average low temperatures of 24 degrees Celsius. Paramaribo on average receives roughly of rainfall each year.

== Demographics ==
Paramaribo has a population of 240,924 people (2012 census). While the population number is stagnating in recent years, many towns in the surrounding Wanica District are increasing in population.

The city is famed for its diverse ethnic makeup with 27% identifying as Creoles (African or mixed African-European descent), 23% as East Indian, 18% as Multiracial, 16% as Maroons (descendants of escaped enslaved Africans), 10% as Javanese, 2% as Indigenous, 1.5% as Chinese, and smaller numbers of Europeans (primarily of Dutch and Portuguese descent), Lebanese and Jews. In the past decades a significant number of Brazilians, Guyanese and new Chinese immigrants have settled in Paramaribo.

== Economy ==

Paramaribo is the business and financial centre of Suriname. Even though the capital city does not produce significant goods itself, almost all revenues from the country&#x27;s main export products gold, oil, bauxite, rice, and tropical wood are channeled through its institutions. All banks, insurance corporations and other financial and commercial companies are headquartered in Paramaribo. Around 75 percent of Suriname&#x27;s GDP is consumed in Paramaribo.

Tourism is an increasingly important sector, with most visitors coming from the Netherlands.

== Government ==

Administratively, Paramaribo forms its own district in Suriname. The resorts of Paramaribo district therefore correspond to boroughs of the city. There are twelve resorts in the Paramaribo district:

== Transport ==

Paramaribo is served by the Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport and Zorg en Hoop Airport for local flights. The Jules Wijdenbosch Bridge, which is part of the East-West Link, connects Paramaribo with Meerzorg on the other side of the Suriname River.

The Jules Sedney Harbour is the main harbour for cargo. The former harbour of Waterkant is used by ferries.

Most airlines like Gum Air, Caricom Airways and Blue Wing Airlines have their head offices on the grounds of Zorg en Hoop Airport in Paramaribo.

== Education ==
Paramaribo&#x27;s institution of higher learning is Anton de Kom University of Suriname, the country&#x27;s only university.

== Healthcare ==

Paramaribo is home to four hospitals, the Academic Hospital Paramaribo, &#x27;s Lands Hospitaal, Sint Vincentius Hospital and Diakonessenhuis. 

== Historic inner city of Paramaribo ==

The Dutch colonial town established in 17th and 18th centuries was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002. The historic inner city is located along the left bank of the Suriname River. The original architecture of buildings and street plan has largely remained intact and preserved.

Port Louis was used as a harbour by the Dutch settlers from 1606, when they started to refer to the area as &quot;Harbour of Tortoises&quot;. In 1736, under French government, it became the administrative centre of Mauritius and a major reprovisioning halt for French ships during their passage between Asia and Europe, around the Cape of Good Hope.
The Port is named in honour of King Louis XV. During this period of French colonization, Mauritius was known as Ile de France. The French governor at that time, Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais, contributed to the development of the city. Since Port Louis was relatively well-protected from strong winds during cyclones by the Moka Mountain Range, Port Louis was selected to house both the main harbor and fort for the island. The value of the port continued during the British occupation of the island during the Napoleonic Wars (1800–15), and helped Britain control the Indian Ocean. However, port calls of ships fell drastically following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Activity in the port increased during the seven-year closure of the Suez Canal (starting in 1967). Modernization of the port in the late 1970s has helped it maintain its role as the central point for all imports and exports from Mauritius. While Port Louis continues to be the business and administrative capital of Mauritius, expansion of the tourism industry in the late 1990s led to considerable development in Port Louis, with many shops, hotels, and restaurants being built in the Caudan Waterfront area.

Raouf Oderuth, the Mauritian Artist provides a 1930s scene depicting the waterfront when motorised transportation hardly existed. Place D’Armes is still recognisable despite high-rise buildings, heavy traffic jams, and crowds of pedestrians.

==Government==

The local governance of Port Louis is overseen by a municipal council. The City Council of Port Louis was first established in 1830 and is currently one of five municipal councils responsible for the urban areas in Mauritius, as organized under Local Government Act 2011. Twenty-four councillors are elected democratically to administer the council. Councillors then elect a Lord Mayor and a Deputy Lord Mayor. Functions of the council are performed through Departments of Administration, Finance, Land Use and Planning, Public Infrastructure, Public Health, Welfare, Parks and Gardens, and the City Library. Services delivered by the local government include preschool, kindergarten, and vocational schools, health protection, housing regulation, road services, refuse collection, cemeteries, some environmental and consumer protection services, and economic promotion activities. Other services are provided to the city by the central government. These include police services through the Mauritius Police Force, which maintains two divisions responsible for the Port Louis area (Metropolitan Divisions North and South). There is also a specific Port Police, composed of the Harbour Police and Bulk Sugar Terminal Police. Their roles include providing security to cargo and facilities in the port area and enforcing laws related to harbour regulations, customs, quarantine, immigration, and drug trafficking.

Port Louis is divided into different suburbs including but not limited to:
* Bell-Village
* Borstal
* Camp Yoloff
* Cassis
* Champ-de-Mars
* Cité La Cure
* Cité Vallijee
* Grande-Rivière-Nord-Ouest
* La Tour Koënig
* Pailles
* Plaine Lauzun
* Plaine-Verte
* Pointe-aux-Sables
* Roche-Bois
* Sainte-Croix
* Tranquebar
* Vallée-des-Prêtres
* Vallée-Pitot
Port Louis is electorally divided into 8 Wards each with 3 Councillors.

==Climate==
Owing to its location in the rain shadow of the southeast trade winds, Port Louis features a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;) under Köppen&#x27;s climate classification. Its wettest months are from December through April where on average (or more) of rainfall occurs each month. The remaining months form Port Louis&#x27; dry season. The city also shows a noticeable but small range of average temperatures. Port Louis&#x27; coolest temperatures are seen mid-year where average high temperatures are around . During the height of the wet season, the city sees its highest temperatures where average high temperatures are usually around .

==Economy==

The economy of the city is mostly dominated by its financial centre, port facilities, tourism, and the manufacturing sector which includes textiles, chemicals, plastics and pharmaceuticals. Port Louis is home to the biggest port facility in the Indian Ocean region and one of Africa&#x27;s major financial centres.

=== Finance industry ===
Port Louis is the financial centre of Mauritius, which has established itself as safe and trusted location for conducting business due to its strong democracy, political stability, and multilingual population. Located in Port Louis is the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Also in Port Louis are over ten commercial banks that serve both domestic and offshore clients, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, leasing companies, and foreign exchange dealers. The oldest bank based in Port Louis is the Mauritius Commercial Bank, which was founded in 1838. The Bank of Mauritius is the central bank of the country. Measuring from ground level to its pinnacle, the Bank of Mauritius Tower is the tallest building in the country.

==Transportation==
Port Louis is served by two major bus stations. Victoria Station is used by buses to and from the eastern and southern areas and the Plaines Wilhems district. Immigration Square, also known as Gare du Nord, is a terminus for buses coming from the northern districts of Pamplemousses and Rivière du Rempart. A number of inter-city buses carry passengers to and from nearby suburbs such as Plaine Verte, Vallée-des-Prêtres, Pailles, Plaine Lauzun, and Cité Vallijee.
Most streets in Port Louis are laid out in rectangular grids, and many are one-way. Although most roads are in good shape, many streets are fairly narrow as would be expected for a historic colonial town. Due to the daily influx of workers to business and government offices in Port Louis, day-time traffic can be quite heavy and finding parking spaces a challenge. To cope with increasing traffic congestion, the government has proposed a light rail transit system. Other suggestions have included moving some of the 24 government ministries currently located in Port Louis to surrounding regions or introducing flexible work schedules.

An effort to move workers from the city centre has already started with the construction of the Ébène office tower complex south of Port Louis. A ring road passing on the east side of Port Louis is also expected to reduce congestion. Phase 1 of that project was completed in 2013, but in February 2014 the road needed to be closed due to the appearance of a major crack, apparently due to faulty design.

Another project initiated to reduce congestion is the construction of a bridge (commonly referred to as the &quot;Dream Bridge&quot;) from Les Salines to Roche-Bois, which will span the Port Louis harbour.

===Light rail transit system===

In 2012, the government decided to construct an approximately 25 km rail system between Curepipe and Port Louis, which had been under consideration for nearly three decades. The project was initiated by a government-to-government agreement with the Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SCE), along with private partners Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) Corporation and the South African/Australian engineering firm Aurecon Ltd. The goal was to develop a preliminary plan of the system, and then solicit expressions of interest for a design-build-operate-finance scheme, with a concession period of 33 years.

Construction for the light rail transit transport system began in the Fall of 2017, with the government of Mauritius awarding the contract to the Mumbai-based design and construction firm Larsen &amp; Toubro. The first stage of Mauritius Metro Express, from Port Louis to Rose Hill Central, was opened in January 2020, the second stage, an extension to Curepipe, in October 2022. 
===Port===

Port Louis is home to the nation&#x27;s main harbour, which is the only official port of entry and exit for sea vessels in Mauritius. Ships must be cleared in the port before visiting any other anchorage in the island nation.

The Mauritius Ports Authority (MPA), established by law in 1998, is the port authority responsible for Port Louis. The MPA provides port infrastructure, enters into contracts with private providers for port and cargo-handling services, promotes the use and development of the ports, and licenses and regulates port and marine services. The harbour adjoins the main city, with the port currently comprising three terminals. Terminal I contains a total of 1180 meters of quay, with six berthing positions for cargo, passengers, and fishing boats. Terminal II contains 986 meters of quays with six berthing positions and includes specialized facilities for handling and storing sugar, fish, tallow, and caustic soda. In particular, the Bulk Sugar Terminal (operated by the Mauritius Sugar Terminal Corporation) can handle vessels with up to 11 meters of draft, can load sugar at a rate of 1450 tons per hour, and can store 175,000 tons of cargo. Also present in Terminal II is a dedicated 124-meter cruise ship jetty, with a dredged depth of 10.8 metres. Terminal III has two 280-meter quays with a depth of 14 meters, and is specialized for handling container ships, having three super-post-Panamax and five post-Panamax gantry cranes. Also present are storage facilities for bulk ethanol and tie-in points for reefer containers. Vessels too large to dock at the quays can anchor at the Outer Anchorage, which is still within the official boundaries of the port.
The number of ships visiting the port numbered over 2,200 annually in 2010. In 2019, cargo container capacity was 1 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units). Overall, the port contributes 2% to the country&#x27;s GDP.

The cruise ship terminal, opened in 2010 and named after Christian Decotter (past chairman of the Mauritius Tourism Advisory Board), illustrates the increasing role of tourism in the economy of Mauritius. Cruise ships of up to 300 metres can be accommodated at the facility, which includes two access bridges for passengers and vehicles. The facility was the first in the Indian Ocean to be capable of handling the largest cruise ships in the world. In 2012, passenger arrivals by sea included 11,510 tourists and 6,450 excursionists who arrived aboard 23 cruise ships.

Berthing facilities are available at the Caudan Waterfront. Available are 20 berths with electrical and water connections, showers and toilets, laundry, and vehicle parking. Also available are dry dock and hull and sail repair facilities. Depths of the berths range from 2 to 4 meters, depending on the tide, and up to 30-metre ships can be accommodated.

Also based in the port is the National Coast Guard facility, at Quay A of Terminal I.

==Education==
Port-Louis houses several secondary schools which include Alpha College, Bhujoharry College, Labourdonnais College, Port Louis Academy, Loreto College, Madad Ul Islam Girls College, Muslim Girls College, City College, Full Day School, Institute of Islamic and Secular Studies, London College, Ocep The Open College, and Port Louis High School, MEDCO Trinity Secondary School, MEDCO Trinity Secondary School, Port Louis North SSS, and Sir Abdool Razack Mohammed SSS, Goolam Mohammed Dawjee Atchia State College, MEDCO Cassis Secondary School, Renganaden Seeneevassen SSS, Port Louis SSS and Royal College Port Louis. The state also operates a vocational school for boys, Immaculee Conception SSV.

The major institute of tertiary education in Port Louis is the University of Technology, Mauritius, a public university with a technology focus. The École de Medecine Louis Pasteur prepares students for medical studies at Universite de Lille in France. Several technical schools also have locations in the city, including the Jhurry Rya School which specializes in information technology, Appavoo Business School, Apollo Bramwell Nursing School, BSP School of Accountancy &amp; Management, and the London College of Accountancy.

==Architecture==

The city is full of numerous buildings and monuments that reflect its rich and diverse colonial history. Near the city centre, there are several French colonial buildings that date to the 18th century, including the Government House. Other prominent traditional elements include the Jummah Mosque, the majestic English Saint James Cathedral, the Indian Tamil Temple, the elegant five-tier colonial Port Louis Theatre (Théâtre de Port-Louis), the Champ de Mars Racecourse, and the nearby Chinese Pagoda. Also present are some typical houses from past eras, which are mostly wooden structures with shuttered windows and large porches. However, many historic buildings are in a poor state of repair and are being quickly replaced with homes and commercial structures constructed from more durable but less sustainable materials such as concrete, and the city now includes many glass/concrete high-rises.

===Chinatown===
The Pagoda is a central feature of the Port Louis Chinatown, which is one of several Chinatowns in Africa. Its entrance is marked by a large &quot;friendship&quot; gate, just east of the Central Market. The site was the traditional location of homes and shops of the Chinese community, which was dominated by descendants of the Hakka Chinese, who first came to Mauritius in 1826.

Chinatown is now home to a more diverse community, but preserves its original appearance and contains many small shops and restaurants. Its old buildings and Chinese pagodas face the modern buildings of the city&#x27;s business centre. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce (founded in 1908 and second only to Singapore as the world&#x27;s oldest) hosts a popular food and cultural festival each April or May. The Chamber also runs a funeral parlour for the Chinese Community called &#x27;Kit Lok&#x27;, to provide vigil facilities for bereaved families.

==Culture==
Port Louis has been an active cultural city attracting painters, poets, sculptors, and writers for centuries. Marie-Thérèse Humbert wrote her famous novel, &quot;La Montagne des Signaux&quot;, with Port-Louis in mind. Malcolm de Chazal was a common Mauritian visionary writer and painter who was often seen in the capital, mostly at the central market, Champ de Mars and l&#x27;hôtel National. Robert Edouard-Hart, a great poet found in this very active city a source of inspiration. Port-Louis-born poet and semiologist Khal Torabully, the foremost poet of indenture and coolitude, recently designed Travellers&#x27; Lane at the Jardin de la Compagnie, inaugurated by Navin Ramgoolam, the Mauritian Prime Minister and the Parcours Culturel with aphorisms of Malcolm de Chazal, just facing the famous Port Louis Theatre. That theater, still in use and catering mostly to presentations of classical music, jazz, and local drama, has a distinguished history that includes the first presentation of opera on the island in the 19th century by travelling European troupes.

More modern entertainment facilities in Port Louis include several cinemas, in which most films are presented in French and English. Recently opened in Paille, a suburb of Port Louis, is the ultra-modern Swami Vivekananda International Convention Centre. It is the first such facility in Mauritius and is used to house conventions, concerts, trade shows, and exhibitions. 
English is currently the official language of Port Louis and Mauritius.

===Museums===

The Blue Penny Museum is located at the Caudan Waterfront, and is dedicated to the history and art of the island. Its collection includes antique marine maps, paintings, sculptures, engravings, and stamps, including examples of the famous orange-red one penny and deep blue two-pence stamps. The Natural History Museum of Port Louis houses exhibits of the impressive fauna of Mauritius, with a gallery devoted to birds and terrestrial animals, a second focusing on marine species, and a third focused on the dodo, the famous Mauritian bird which became extinct during the Dutch occupation. The Mauritius Postal Museum is housed in an old stone building that dates to the 18th century, and houses displays of stamps and postal paraphernalia from Mauritius and around the world. The Mauritius Photography Museum, located in a small 18th-century white-washed French colonial building, is a private museum that displays artifacts and documents about Mauritian photography and the early days of cinematography. The Aapravasi Ghat is the remains of the immigration depot that was built by the British Government to import labourers from India, Eastern Africa, Madagascar, China, and Southeast Asia to work on the island&#x27;s sugar estates. Although not a museum in a traditional sense, the National Library of Mauritius houses a rich and comprehensive collection of material related to Mauritius history, including manuscripts, books, newspapers, periodicals, music scores, photographs, maps, drawings, and other graphic art forms and audiovisual materials, in addition to providing the traditional services of a library to residents of the city and nation.

== Places of worship == 
The most common places of worship are Hindu temples. There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of Port-Louis (Catholic Church), Church of the Province of the Indian Ocean (Anglican Communion), Assemblies of God and Muslim mosques.

==Sports==

Sports are popular among the inhabitants of Port Louis, as in the rest of Mauritius. Over 35 sports federations are organized under the aegis of the Mauritius Sports Council. Popular activities include football, volleyball, a range of martial arts (Karate, Taekwon Do, Wushu), table tennis, badminton, and pétanque, which is a form of boules. The Mauritius National Olympic committee is also based in Port Louis. Public sports facilities in Port Louis include St. François Xavier stadium, which is used for football. There is however a general dearth of public facilities in Port Louis proper, with most being built in the surrounding less-densely inhabited suburbs and districts.

Football clubs are organized nationwide by the Mauritius Football Association, which currently has ten teams in its Premier League. This includes the Port Louis team, named the Association Sportive Port-Louis 2000 (AS Port-Louis 2000), which won the national championship in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2011.

Another popular sports activity in Port Louis is the Thoroughbred horse races held at the Champ de Mars Racecourse, which is the second oldest horse race track in the world. Gambling on the horse races can be done both with bookies and the tote, available at multiple locations inside the grandstand.

Gambling, in general, is a popular &quot;sport&quot; in Port Louis. Besides the racecourse, within Port Louis gambling can be done in four casinos that offer table games plus gaming, slot, and video poker machines. Port Louis includes the largest casino in the entire country of Mauritius, the Caudan Waterfront Casino at Labourdonnais Waterfront Hotel. Other casinos are the Le Grand Casino du Domaine, L&#x27;Amicale Casino, and the Senator Club.

<text>(; Tok Pisin: &quot;Pot Mosbi&quot;), also referred to as Pom City or simply Moresby, is the capital and largest city of Papua New Guinea. It is one of the largest cities in the southwestern Pacific (along with Jayapura) outside of Australia and New Zealand. It is located on the shores of the Gulf of Papua, on the south-western coast of the Papuan Peninsula of the island of New Guinea. The city emerged as a trade centre in the second half of the 19th century. During World War II, it was a prime objective for conquest by the Imperial Japanese forces during 1942–43 as a staging point and air base to cut off Australia from Southeast Asia and the Americas. Due to its population and outsized influence compared to other cities in Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby may be regarded as a primate city.

As of the 2011 census, Port Moresby had 364,145 inhabitants. An unofficial 2020 estimate gives the population as 383,000. The place where the city was founded has been inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu people for centuries. The first Briton to see it was Royal Navy Captain John Moresby in 1873. It was named in honour of his father, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby.

Although Port Moresby is surrounded by Central Province, of which it is also the capital, it is not part of that province but forms the National Capital District. The traditional landowners, the Motu and Koitabu people, are represented by the Motu Koita Assembly.

Port Moresby hosted the APEC summit in November 2018. However, there were concerns about security given the capital&#x27;s reputation for violent crime.

==History==
===Before colonisation===
Prior to the arrival of Europeans to the region, it was inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu. The Motu were originally coastal dwellers, while the Koitabu lived more inland. There was significant intermarriage between these two groups. They were organized into units called &quot;iduhu&quot;, which are somewhat similar to clans.

===Colonisation===

In 1883, Queensland attempted to annex the south-eastern corner of the New Guinea Island (subsequently known as Papua), fearing that Germany would take control of the entire eastern half of the island. British authorities refused to approve the annexation following the German annexation of New Guinea in 1884, but four years later it established a protectorate over Papua as British New Guinea.

In 1905, the recently federated Australian government passed the Papua Act which came into effect in 1906. The act transferred Papua, with Port Moresby as its capital, to direct Australian rule. From then until 1941 Port Moresby grew slowly. The main growth was on the peninsula, where port facilities and other services were gradually improved. The first butcher&#x27;s shop and grocery opened in 1909, electricity was introduced in 1925, and piped water supply was provided in 1941.

===World War II===

During World War II, some Papuan men enlisted in the Papua Infantry Battalion and others as carriers over trails and rough terrains (porters) as supply support to Allied and Japanese armies during long jungle marches. Historian William Manchester outlines in his biography of General Douglas MacArthur, &quot;American Caesar&quot;, that acting as porters was well down the natives&#x27; list of acceptable voluntary activities and that they would fade away without great inducements. Many Papuan residents of Port Moresby either returned to their family villages or were evacuated to camps when the threat of Japanese invasion loomed. By September 1942, the city was an important Allied complex of bases, and thousands of troops were stationed in the area or more often, staged through it, as it was the last Allied bastion on the island and, conversely, a key staging and jumping off point as the Allies began conducting offensive warfare themselves, pushing back the Japanese advances. General MacArthur located his headquarters in Port Moresby from November 1942 to October 1944.

In 1945, the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was formed when Papua and the former German New Guinea, which had been administered by Australia since 1918, were amalgamated under a single Australian administration though several laws remained in two territories and remain so, which can be complicating with provinces sitting on two sides of the otherwise extinct boundary. Port Moresby became the capital of the new combined territory and a focal point for the expansion of public services. Port Moresby was granted city status in 1972, with Oala Oala-Rarua becoming the first Lord Mayor.

===Independence===
In September 1975, Papua New Guinea became an independent country with Port Moresby as its capital city. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, represented the Queen of Papua New Guinea at the celebrations. New government, intellectual and cultural buildings were constructed in the suburb of Waigani to supplement and replace those of downtown Port Moresby. They included those for government departments, including a National Parliament Building, which was opened in 1984 by Prince Charles and blends traditional design with modern building technology.


The Papua New Guinea National Museum and National Library are in Waigani. A mansion was built in Port Moresby just west of the old legislative building but the last pre-independence chief minister and first prime minister of the sovereign state declared it not nearly grand enough; it was made the residence of Australian high commissioners and a mansion suitable to Somare&#x27;s demands was built in Waigani.

Several of the government buildings have been abandoned due to long-term neglect. Chief amongst these are Marea Haus (known to most locals as the &quot;Pineapple Building&quot;) and the Central Government Offices. However, widespread restoration rather than demolition of long-disused office buildings has been highly active since the first decade of the 21st century. The legislative building before independence and the first parliament building is long-gone but the old court house in town Port Moresby remains, bearing its pre-independence label with its previous title.

The population of the Port Moresby area expanded rapidly after independence. In 1980, the census return registered a population of 120,000; by 1990, this had increased to 195,000.

==Climate==
Moresby has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;) with relatively constant temperatures throughout the year. Port Moresby&#x27;s average yearly rainfall is , making it the driest place in New Guinea.

The wet season starts in December and ends in May; the dry season covers the remaining six months. This is due to the south easterly trade winds running parallel to the coast, and the city being surrounded by high mountains. The average high temperatures range from depending on time of year, while the average low temperature shows very little seasonal variation, hovering around the mark. It tends to be slightly cooler in the city during the dry season.
==District, LLGs and suburbs==

Port Moresby is the single district of the National Capital District, which contains three Local Level Government (LLG) areas. For census purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards and those into census units.

The National Capital District machinery of government also incorporates the Motu Koita Assembly, established by an act of parliament to represent the traditional landowners of Port Moresby, the Motu and Koitabu people. The Assembly governs the traditional lands and inhabitants of the ten recognised villages, and is the only entity of its kind in Papua New Guinea. The Chair of the Motu Koita Assembly also holds the position of Deputy Governor of the National Capital District. 

Port Moresby refers to both the urbanised area of the National Capital District and more specifically to the main business area, known locally as &quot;Town&quot;. 

Since the 1990s the original town centre has ceased to have restaurants and night life, though it is very successful and prosperous-looking as an office centre. The affluent housing region north of downtown along and up from the coast remains so, though there are now few modest residential houses, most of which are replaced with substantial mansions and apartment buildings. 

The suburb of Boroko, once the commercial heart of Port Moresby, is very idle, with many former shopping buildings now empty; the west is full of high rises, shopping centres and affluent housing. Other neighbourhoods of Port Moresby include Koki, with its popular fresh produce market, Newtown, Konedobu, Kaevaga, Badili, Gabutu, Kila Kila, Matirogo, Three Mile, Kaugere, Sabama, Korobosea, Four Mile, Hohola, Hohola North, Boroko, Gordons, Gordons North, Erima, Saraga, Waigani, Morata and Gerehu. 

===Villages===
Villages within Port Moresby include:
* Hanuabada, which offers a safe haven for LGBT people in PNG
* Kira Kira village (sometimes spelt Kirakira), the home town of Australian footballer Mary Fowler&#x27;s mother

==Crime==
&quot;Al Jazeera&quot; describes Port Moresby as &quot;one of the most dangerous cities in the world&quot;. &quot;ABC Australia&quot; reports that &quot;many homes have big fences covered in metal sheeting, locked gates and internal steel security doors.&quot;
Travel by foot is not recommended in and about the city and suburbs due to continuing breakdown in law and order. The UN Global Compact Cities Programme, using a method called Circles of Sustainability, has assessed the urban security of Port Moresby as &#x27;critical&#x27;.

==Transport==

Port Moresby is served within the city by buses and privately owned taxis. Flights are vital for transport about the country, highways not being widely available. Port Moresby is served by Jacksons International Airport, the biggest international airport and Papua New Guinea Defence Force Air Wing base in the country.

As the national highway system is not fully linked, there are many internal flights to other towns, such as Lae and Madang, which have no direct road connection to Port Moresby.

== Economy ==
Papua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, which account for two thirds of its export earnings. Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of development led foreign countries to take over some sites. Continuing foreign demand for PNG&#x27;s resources led the United States to set up an oil company that began to export in 2004. This was the largest project in PNG&#x27;s history. The project increased the potential to triple PNG&#x27;s export revenue. Papua New Guinea gained much assistance from Australia and was offered two hundred million dollars a year in aid, and many countries such as Singapore, Japan and China have also played a great part in PNG&#x27;s industry business. The decision to host the 2018 APEC meeting, brought a large number of world leaders to Port Moresby.

There has been substantial building of housing, office towers, shopping malls and commercial establishments over much of the city. The waterfront area has been completely redeveloped with apartments, restaurants and shopping centres. Sporting facilities were upgraded significantly for the 2015 South Pacific Games, and further development took place in preparation for the 2016 FIFA Under-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup.

Air Niugini, the national airline of Papua New Guinea, and Airlines PNG, the second biggest airline in the country, have their head offices on the grounds of Jacksons International Airport.

== Sports ==
The 1969 South Pacific Games, held from 13 to 23 August 1969 at Port Moresby, were the third South Pacific Games to be held. A total of 1,150 athletes participated.

The 1991 South Pacific Games held from 7–21 September 1991 at Port Moresby and along Lae were the ninth South Pacific Games to be held. This was the first time that events at one games had been held in two cities. The decision to do so was to allow both locations to benefit from the construction of new facilities.

Cricket PNG is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Papua New Guinea. Its headquarters is in Port Moresby. Cricket PNG is Papua New Guinea&#x27;s representative at the International Cricket Council and is an associate member and has been a member of that body since 1973. It is also a member of the East Asia-Pacific Cricket Council.

The city hosted the 2017 FIBA Melanesia Basketball Cup, where the Papua New Guinea national basketball team won the gold medal.

The city is home to the Port Moresby Vipers rugby league team who play in the Papua New Guinea National Rugby League. The National football stadium is also home to the PNG Hunters, a rugby league team that compete in the majority Australian Queensland Cup.

=== 2015 Pacific Games in Port Moresby ===
The 2015 Pacific Games was held in Port Moresby from 4 to 18 July 2015. In September 2009, the Pacific Games Council, at its meeting coinciding with the 2009 Pacific Mini Games, elected Port Moresby as the host of the 2015 Games. The final vote was 25–22 in favour of Port Moresby over Tonga to host.

The 2015 Pacific Games involved 24 countries from the Pacific regions competing in 28 sports events, including: basketball, soccer, touch rugby, table tennis, weightlifting, triathlon, swimming, cricket, squash, shooting, sailing, va&#x27;a, rugby 7s, powerlifting, rugby league 9s, volleyball, beach volleyball, athletics, hockey, netball, karate, lawn bowls, bodybuilding, boxing, softball, taekwondo, golf, and canoeing. Papua New Guinea ranked first with the most medals followed by New Caledonia and Tahiti.

The opening ceremony took place on 4 July 2015 involving various traditional dances. The closing ceremony involved singers such as J Boog, Fiji, O-Shen and George Mamua Telek.

<text>Port Vila ( ; ), or simply Vila (), is the capital of Vanuatu and its largest city. It is on the island of Efate, in Shefa Province.

The population was 49,034 as of the 2020 census. In 2020, the population of Port Vila formed 16.3% of the country&#x27;s population.

Located on the east coast of the island of Efate, Port Vila is the economic and commercial centre of Vanuatu. The mayor is Jenny Regenvanu of the Land and Justice Party, the first woman to hold the position, elected in August 2024. Her deputy is Marie Louise Milne, of the Green Confederation.

== Name ==
Locally, the town is most commonly referred to simply as &quot;Vila&quot;, whether in French or Bislama or in English (not like English &quot;villa&quot;).

The name of the area is &quot;Efil&quot; in the native South Efate language and &quot;Ifira&quot; in neighbouring Mele-Fila language. &quot;Vila&quot; is a variant of these names. Ifira is a small island in Vila harbour where many traditional landowners reside.

== History ==
Melanesian people have occupied the Port Vila area for thousands of years. In the autumn of 2004, an archaeological expedition known as &quot;Teouma&quot; discovered a burial site of 25 tombs containing three dozen skeletons of members of the Lapita culture. Pieces of ceramics found at the site were dated to the 13th century BC.

Efate Island was charted in 1774 by James Cook, who named it Sandwich Island. Cook&#x27;s expedition did not land but noted the presence of good harbours and land suitable for European settlement. In the late 19th century, when the islands were known as the New Hebrides, the British initially had the dominant European presence. However, by the 1890s, the economic balance had begun favouring the French, who established large plantations. French citizen Ferdinand Chevillard began buying and clearing land around Port Vila to be converted into the largest French plantation on the island. Instead, it was converted into the municipality of Franceville, which declared independence on 9 August 1889, though this only lasted until June of the following year.

After 1887, the territory was jointly administered by the French and the British. This was formalized in 1906 as an Anglo-French Condominium. During World War II, Port Vila was an American and Australian airbase.

In 1987, Cyclone Uma severely damaged the city. A powerful earthquake on 3 January 2002 caused minor damage in the capital and surrounding areas. 

The city suffered massive damage from a category 5 cyclone named Cyclone Pam on 13 March 2015, whose eye wall passed just to the east of Port Vila. On 17 December 2024, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake reportedly damaged almost every single house in Port Vila, resulting in 16 fatalities. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 116,000 people had been directly affected by the earthquake, equivalent to a third of Vanuatu&#x27;s population.

Major industries in the city remain agriculture and fishing. Tourism is also becoming important, especially from Australia and New Zealand. There were over 80,000 visitors in 1997.

Vanuatu is a tax haven, and offshore financing in Port Vila is an important part of the economy.

Vanuatu is still dependent on foreign aid, most of which comes from Australia and New Zealand, although in recent years, assistance has also come from China. One example was New Zealand paying to train doctors selected from the local community, then paying part of their wages during the first year after qualification. Australia has paid consultants to work in Port Vila Central Hospital.

The capital of Vanuatu has various sights to offer. There are several memorials, e.g., opposite the Parliament, where two traditional totem poles and a monument representing a pig&#x27;s tusk can be seen. The Presbyterian Church of Port Vila is an impressive and sightworthy building opposite the Independence Park. A colourful wall painting can be seen on the administration building opposite the market hall. Another noteworthy wall painting is on the façade of the post office. The City Hall of Port Vila is an oblong and sightworthy building on a hill in the city centre.

=== Vanuatu Cultural Centre ===

The Vanuatu Cultural Centre, hosting the Vanuatu National Museum, is located at the Saralana Park in front of the National Parliament, close to the National Library and the Malvatumauri (Vanuatu National Council of Chiefs). This institution is an important place to preserve and promote the different aspects of the local culture. Traditional artifacts from several islands are on display in the museum. The centre also hosts the National Audiovisual Archives, the most critical fund of documents from the late 19th century until today.

=== World Heritage ===
Port Vila was the location in August 1999 for the &quot;2nd World Heritage Global Strategy Meeting for the Pacific Islands Region&quot; held by UNESCO.

<text>Port-au-Prince ( ; ; , ) is the capital and most populous city of Haiti. The city&#x27;s population was estimated at 1,200,000 in 2022 with the metropolitan area estimated at a population of 2,618,894. The metropolitan area is defined by the IHSI as including the communes of Port-au-Prince, Delmas, Cité Soleil, Tabarre, Carrefour, and Pétion-Ville.

The city of Port-au-Prince is on the Gulf of Gonâve: the bay on which the city lies, which acts as a natural harbor, has sustained economic activity since the civilizations of the Taíno. It was first incorporated under French colonial rule in 1749. The city&#x27;s layout is similar to that of an amphitheater; commercial districts are near the water, while residential neighborhoods are located on the hills above. Its population is difficult to ascertain due to the rapid growth of slums in the hillsides above the city; however, recent estimates place the metropolitan area&#x27;s population at around 3.7 million, nearly a third of the country&#x27;s national population. The city was catastrophically affected by a massive earthquake in 2010, with large numbers of structures damaged or destroyed. Haiti&#x27;s government estimated the death toll to be 230,000. Gang violence is extensive, and kidnappings, massacres, and gang rapes are common occurrences, often with the complicity of police officers and politicians.

==Etymology==
 literally means &quot;Prince&#x27;s Port&quot;, but it is unclear which prince was the honoree. 
A theory is that the place is named after &quot;Le Prince&quot;, a ship captained by de Saint-André which arrived in the area in 1706. 
However, the islets in the bay had already been known as as early as 1680, predating the ship&#x27;s arrival. 
Furthermore, the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as , named after the filibusters&#x27; hospital.

French colonial commissioner Étienne Polverel named the city &quot;Port-Républicain&quot; on 23 September 1793 &quot;in order that the inhabitants be kept continually in mind of the obligations which the French Revolution imposed on them.&quot; It was later renamed back to Port-au-Prince by Jacques I, Emperor of Haiti.

When Haiti was divided between a kingdom in the north and a republic in the south, Port-au-Prince was the capital of the republic, under the leadership of Alexandre Pétion. Henri Christophe renamed the city &quot;Port-aux-Crimes&quot; after the assassination of Jacques I at Pont Larnage (now known as Pont-Rouge, and located north of the city).

==History==
===Taino Period===

The Port-au-Prince area was part of the Xaragua chiefdom with the capital city, Yaguana being in Léoganes. There were multiple Taino settlements in the area such as Bohoma and Guahaba. It is understood that most of the plain area was used as hunting grounds.
The Bahoruco mountain range in the north-east of Port-au-Prince was the scene of a Taino rebellion led by Enriquillo resulting in a treaty with the Spanish.

===Spanish colonization===
Prior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus, the island of Hispaniola was inhabited by the Taíno people, who arrived in approximately 2600 BC in large dugout canoes. They are believed to come primarily from what is now eastern Venezuela. By the time Columbus arrived in 1492 AD, the region was under the control of Bohechio, Taíno cacique (chief) Xaragua. He, like his predecessors, feared settling too close to the coast; such settlements would have proven to be tempting targets for the Caribs, who lived on neighboring islands. Instead, the region served as a hunting ground. The population of the region was approximately 400,000 at the time, but the Taínos were gone within 30 years of the arrival of the Spaniards.

With the arrival of the Spaniards, the Amerindians were forced to accept a protectorate, and Bohechio, childless at death, was succeeded by his sister, Anacaona, wife of the cacique Caonabo. The Spanish insisted on larger tributes. Eventually, the Spanish colonial administration decided to rule directly, and in 1503, Nicolas Ovando, then governor, set about to put an end to the régime headed by Anacaona. He invited her and other tribal leaders to a feast, and when the Amerindians had drunk a good deal of wine (the Spaniards did not drink on that occasion), he ordered most of the guests killed. Anacaona was spared, only to be hanged publicly some time later. Through violence, introduced diseases and murders, the Spanish settlers decimated the native population.

Direct Spanish rule over the area having been established, Ovando founded a settlement not far from the coast (west of Etang Saumâtre), ironically named &quot;Santa Maria de la Paz Verdadera&quot;, which would be abandoned several years later. Not long thereafter, Ovando founded &quot;Santa Maria del Puerto&quot;. The latter was first burned by French explorers in 1535, then again in 1592 by the English. These assaults proved to be too much for the Spanish colonial administration, and in 1606, it decided to abandon the region.

=== Domination of the filibustiers===

For more than 50 years, the area that is today Port-au-Prince saw its population drop off drastically, when some buccaneers began to use it as a base, and Dutch merchants began to frequent it in search of leather, as game was abundant there. Around 1650, French , running out of room on the Île de la Tortue, began to arrive on the coast, and established a colony at Trou-Borded. As the colony grew, they set up a hospital not far from the coast, on the Turgeau heights. This led to the region being known as .

Although there had been no real Spanish presence in Hôpital for well over 50 years, Spain retained its formal claim to the territory, and the growing presence of the French &quot;flibustiers&quot; on ostensibly Spanish lands provoked the Spanish crown to dispatch Castilian soldiers to Hôpital to retake it. The mission proved to be a disaster for the Spanish, as they were outnumbered and outgunned, and in 1697, the Spanish government signed the Treaty of Ryswick, renouncing any claims to Hôpital. Around this time, the French also established bases at Ester (part of Petite Rivière) and Gonaïves.

Ester was a rich village, inhabited by merchants, and equipped with straight streets; it was here that the governor lived. On the other hand, the surrounding region, Petite-Rivière, was quite poor. Following a great fire in 1711, Ester was abandoned. Yet the French presence in the region continued to grow, and soon afterward, a new city was founded to the south, Léogâne.
While the first French presence in Hôpital, the region later to contain Port-au-Prince was that of the &quot;flibustiers&quot;; as the region became a real French colony, the colonial administration began to worry about the continual presence of these pirates. While useful in repelling foreign pirates, they were relatively independent, unresponsive to orders from the colonial administration, and a potential threat to it. Therefore, in the winter of 1707, Choiseul-Beaupré, the governor of the region sought to get rid of what he saw as a threat. He insisted upon control of the hospital, but the &quot;flibustiers&quot; refused, considering that humiliating. They proceeded to close the hospital rather than cede control of it to the governor, and many of them became &quot;habitans&quot; (farmers) the first long-term European inhabitants in the region.

Although the elimination of the &quot;flibustiers&quot; as a group from Hôpital reinforced the authority of the colonial administration, it also made the region a more attractive target for marauding buccaneers. In order to protect the area, in 1706, a captain named de Saint-André sailed into the bay just below the hospital, in a ship named &quot;Le Prince&quot;. It is said that M. de Saint-André named the area &quot;Port-au-Prince&quot; (meaning &quot;Port of the Prince&quot;), but the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as &quot;Hôpital&quot;, but the islets in the bay had already been known as &quot;les îlets du Prince&quot; as early as 1680.

Pirates eventually refrained from troubling the area, and various nobles sought land grants from the French crown in Hôpital; the first noble to control Hôpital was Sieur Joseph Randot. Upon his death in 1737, Sieur Pierre Morel gained control over part of the region, with Gatien Bretton des Chapelles acquiring another portion of it.

By then, the colonial administration was convinced that a capital needed to be chosen, in order to better control the French portion of Hispaniola (Saint-Domingue). For a time, Petit-Goâve and Léogâne vied for this honor, but both were eventually ruled out for various reasons. Neither was centrally located. Petit-Goâve&#x27;s climate caused it to be too malarial, and Léogane&#x27;s topography made it difficult to defend. Thus, in 1749, a new city was built, Port-au-Prince.

===Foundation of Port-au-Prince===

In 1770, Port-au-Prince replaced Cap-Français (the modern Cap-Haïtien) as capital of the colony of Saint-Domingue.

In November 1791, it was burned in a battle between attacking black revolutionaries and defending white plantation owners.

It was captured by British troops on 4 June 1794, after the Battle of Port-Républicain.

In 1804, it became the capital of newly independent Haïti. When Jean-Jacques Dessalines was assassinated in 1806, Port-au-Prince became the capital of the mulatto-dominated south (Cap-Haïtien was the capital of the black-dominated north). It was re-established as the capital of all of Haiti when the country was unified again in 1820.

===American occupation===
During the American occupation of Haiti (1915–1934), Port-au-Prince, garrisoned by American Marines and Haitian gendarmes, was attacked twice by caco rebels. The first battle, which took place in 1919, was a victory of the American and Haitian government forces, as was the second attack in 1920.

===2010 earthquake===


On 12 January 2010, a 7.0 earthquake struck Port-au-Prince, devastating the city. Most of the central historic area of the city was destroyed, including Haiti&#x27;s prized Cathédrale de Port-au-Prince, the capital building, Legislative Palace (the parliament building), Palace of Justice (Supreme Court building), several ministerial buildings, and at least one hospital. The second floor of the Presidential Palace was thrown into the first floor, and the domes skewed at a severe tilt. The seaport and airport were both damaged, limiting aid shipments. The seaport was severely damaged by the quake and was unable to accept aid shipments for the first week.

The airport&#x27;s control tower was damaged and the US military had to set up a new control center with generators to get the airport prepared for aid flights. Aid has been delivered to Port-au-Prince by numerous nations and voluntary groups as part of a global relief effort. On Wednesday 20 January 2010, an aftershock rated at a magnitude of 5.9 caused additional damage. The City Hall (Mairie de Port-au-Prince) and most of the city&#x27;s other government municipal buildings were destroyed in the 2010 earthquake. Ralph Youri Chevry was the mayor of the city at the time of the earthquake.

===Hurricanes===

The worst hurricane season experienced by Haiti occurred in 2008 when four storms Fay, Gustav, Hanna, and Ike negatively impacted Haiti. Nearly 800 people were killed; 22,000 homes were destroyed; 70% of the country&#x27;s crops were lost, according to reliefweb.org. Then, in 2012, Hurricane Sandy, while not making direct impact, resulted in 75 deaths, $250 million in damage and a resurgence of cholera that was estimated to infected 5,000 people. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused catastrophic damage across Haiti, and over 500 deaths were associated with the storm in Haiti alone, along with at least $3 billion in damages. The storm also caused a massive humanitarian crisis shortly after.

==Geography==
The metropolitan area is subdivided into various communes (districts). There is a ring of districts that radiates out from the commune of Port-au-Prince. Pétion-Ville is an affluent suburban commune located southeast of the city. Delmas is located directly south of the airport and north of the central city, and the rather poor commune of Carrefour is located southwest of the city.

The commune harbors many low-income slums plagued with poverty and violence in which the most notorious, Cité Soleil, is situated. However, Cité Soleil has been recently split off from Port-au-Prince proper to form a separate commune. The Champ de Mars area has begun some modern infrastructure development as of recently. The downtown area is the site of several projected modernization efforts in the capital.

===Climate===
Port-au-Prince has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen Aw) and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Port-au-Prince&#x27;s wet season runs from March through November with rainfall peaking from April to May and from August to October, with the city experiencing a relative break in rainfall during the months of June and July. The city&#x27;s dry season covers the remaining three months. Port-au-Prince generally experiences warm and humid conditions during the dry season and hot and humid conditions during the wet season.

==Demographics==

The population of the area was 1,234,742.
The majority of the population is of African descent, but a prominent biracial minority controls many of the city&#x27;s businesses. There are sizable numbers of residents, Asians, as well as a number of Europeans (both foreign-born and native-born).

Citizens of Arab (particularly Syrian, Lebanese, and Israeli Arab) ancestry have a large presence in the capital. Arab Haitians (a large number of whom live in Port-au-Prince) are, more often than not, concentrated in financial areas where the majority of them establish businesses. Most of the biracial residents of the city are concentrated within wealthier areas.

==Economy==

Port-au-Prince is one of the nation&#x27;s largest centers of economy and finance. The capital exports its most widely consumed produce of coffee and sugar, and has, in the past, exported other goods, such as shoes and baseballs. Port-au-Prince has food-processing plants as well as soap, textile and cement factories. Despite political unrest, the city also relies on the tourism industry and construction companies to move its economy. Port-au-Prince was once a popular place for cruises, but has lost nearly all of its tourism, and no longer has cruise ships coming into port.

Unemployment in Port-au-Prince is high, and compounded further by underemployment. Levels of economic activity remain prominent throughout the city, especially among people selling goods and services on the streets. Informal employment is believed to be widespread in Port-au-Prince&#x27;s slums, as otherwise the population could not survive. Port-au-Prince has several upscale districts in which crime rates are significantly lower than in the city center.

Port-au-Prince has a tourism industry. The Toussaint Louverture International Airport (referred to often as the Port-au-Prince International Airport) is the country&#x27;s main international gateway for tourists. Tourists often visit the Pétion-Ville area of Port-au-Prince, with other sites of interest including gingerbread houses.

==Health==
There are a number of hospitals including le Centre Hospitalier du Sacré-Cœur, Hôpital de l&#x27;Université d&#x27;État d&#x27;Haïti (l&#x27;HUEH), Centre Obstetrico Gynécologique Isaïe Jeanty-Léon Audain, Hôpital du Canapé-Vert, Hôpital Français (Asile Français), Hôpital Saint-François de Sales, Hôpital-Maternité Sapiens, Hôpital OFATMA, Clinique de la Santé, Maternité de Christ Roi, Centre Hospitalier Rue Berne and Maternité Mathieu.

After the 2010 earthquake, two hospitals remained that were operational. The University of Miami in partnership with Project Medishare has created a new hospital, L&#x27;Hôpital Bernard Mevs Project Medishare, to provide inpatient and outpatient care for those impacted by the January 2010 earthquake. This hospital is volunteer staffed and provides level 1 trauma care to Port-au-Prince and the surrounding regions.

CDTI (Centre de Diagnostique et de Traitement Intégré) closed in April 2010 when international aid failed to materialize. It had been considered the country&#x27;s premiere hospital.

==Culture==
The culture of the city lies primarily in the center around the National Palace as well as its surrounding areas. The National Museum is located in the grounds of the palace, established in 1938. The National Palace was one of the early structures of the city but was destroyed and then rebuilt in 1918. It was destroyed again by the earthquake on 12 January 2010 which collapsed the center&#x27;s domed roof.
Another popular destination in the capital is the Hotel Oloffson, a 19th-century gingerbread mansion that was once the private home of two former Haitian presidents. It has become a popular hub for tourist activity in the central city. The Cathédrale de Port-au-Prince is a famed site of cultural interest and attracts foreign visitors to its Neo-Romantic architectural style.

The Musée d&#x27;Art Haïtien du Collège Saint-Pierre contains work from some of the country&#x27;s most talented artists, and the Musée National is a museum featuring historical artifacts such as King Henri Christophe&#x27;s actual suicide pistol and a rusty anchor that museum operators claim was salvaged from Christopher Columbus&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Santa María&quot;. Other notable cultural sites include the Archives Nationales, the Bibliothèque Nationale (National Library) and Expressions Art Gallery. The city is the birthplace of internationally known naïve artist Gesner Abelard, who was associated with the Centre d&#x27;Art. The Musée du Panthéon National Haïtien (MUPANAH) is a museum featuring the heroes of the independence of Haiti, the Haitian history and culture.

On 5 April 2015, the construction of a new LDS Temple in Port-au-Prince was announced.

Port-au-Prince is the only city anywhere in the world to have a main avenue named for American abolitionist hero John Brown. Another is named for another abolitionist hero, Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner.

=== Celebrations ===
There is a celebration of Bawon Samdi and Gran Brigi called Fet Gede, which takes place from the Day of the Dead on 1 November through the third day of the month. This occurs in the national cemetery of Haiti. While celebrating, people wear Vodou white cotton clothing and purple headscarves. During the celebration, the cemetery becomes packed with people. Those who are celebrating make sacrifices of food for the spirits (mange lwa) and pour liquor on the gravestones among other festivities.

==Government==

The mayor of Port-au-Prince is Lucsonne Janvier, who succeeded Ralph Youri Chevry in July 2020. In 2023, Janvier&#x27;s City Hall employees protested lack of salaries.

==Education==
Port-au-Prince various educational institutions, ranging from small vocational schools to universities. Influential international schools in Port-au-Prince include Union School, founded in 1919, and Quisqueya Christian School, founded in 1974. Both schools offer an American-style pre-college education. French-speaking students can attend the Lycée Français (Lycée Alexandre Dumas), located in Bourdon. Another school is Anís Zunúzí Bahá&#x27;í School north west of Port-au-Prince which opened its doors in 1980 which survived the 2010 Haiti earthquake and its staff were cooperating in relief efforts and sharing space and support with neighbors.

A clinic was run at the school by a medical team from the United States and Canada. Its classes offered transition from Haitian Creole to the French language but also a secondary language in English. The State University of Haiti (&quot;Université d&#x27;État d&#x27;Haïti&quot; in French or UEH), is located within the capital along other universities such as the Quisqueya University and the &quot;Université des Caraïbes&quot;. There are many other institutions that observe the Haitian scholastic program. Many of them are religious academies led by foreign missionaries from France or Canada. These include Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague, École Sainte-Rose-de-Lima, École Saint-Jean-Marie Vianney, Institution du Sacré-Coeur, and Collège Anne-Marie Javouhey.

The Ministry of Education is also located in downtown Port-au-Prince at the Palace of Ministries, adjacent to the National Palace in the Champ de Mars plaza.

The Haitian Group of Research and Pedagogical Activities (GHRAP) has set up several community centers for basic education. UNESCO&#x27;s office at Port-au-Prince has taken a number of initiates in upgrading the educational facilities in Port-au-Prince.

==Crime==

A 2012 independent study found that the murder rate in Port-au-Prince was 60.9 murders per 100,000 residents in February 2012. In the 22 months after the end of the President Aristide era in 2004, the murder rate for Port-au-Prince reached a high of 219 murders per 100,000 residents per year.

High-crime zones in the Port-au-Prince area include Croix-des-Bouquets, Cité Soleil, Carrefour, Bel Air, Martissant, the port road (Boulevard La Saline), urban route Nationale 1, the airport road (Boulevard Toussaint-Louverture) and its adjoining connectors to the New (&quot;American&quot;) Road via Route Nationale 1. This latter area in particular has been the scene of numerous robberies, carjackings, and murders.

In the Bel Air neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, the murder rate reached 50 murders per 100,000 residents at the end of 2011, up from 19 murders per 100,000 residents in 2010.

==Transportation==

===Roads===

All of the major transportation systems in Haiti are located near or run through the capital. The northern highway, Route Nationale #1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince. The southern highway, Route Nationale #2 also runs through Port-au-Prince. Maintenance for these roads lapsed after the 1991 coup, prompting the World Bank to lend US$50 million designated for road repairs. The project was canceled in January 1999, however, after auditors revealed corruption. A third major highway, the Haitian Route Nationale #3, connects Port-au-Prince to the central plateau; however, due to its poor condition, it sees limited use.

===Public transportation===

The most common form of public transportation in Haiti is the use of brightly painted pickup trucks as taxis called &quot;tap-taps.&quot;

===Seaport===

The seaport, Port international de Port-au-Prince, has more registered shipping than any of the over dozen ports in the country. The port&#x27;s facilities include cranes, large berths, and warehouses, but these facilities are in universally poor shape. The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees compared to ports in the Dominican Republic.

===Airports===

Toussaint Louverture International Airport (Maïs Gâté), which opened in 1965 (as François Duvalier International Airport), is north of the city. It is Haiti&#x27;s major jetway, and as such, handles the vast majority of the country&#x27;s international flights. Transportation to smaller cities from the major airport is done via smaller aircraft. Companies providing this service include Caribintair and Sunrise Airways.

<text>Port of Spain, officially the City of Port of Spain (also stylized Port-of-Spain), is the capital city of Trinidad and Tobago. With a municipal population of 49,867 (2017), an urban population of 81,142 and a transient daily population of 250,000, it is Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s third largest municipality, after Chaguanas and San Fernando. Port of Spain is located on the Gulf of Paria, on the northwest coast of the island of Trinidad and is part of a larger conurbation stretching from Chaguaramas in the west to Arima in the east with an estimated population of 600,000.

The city serves primarily as a retail and administrative centre and it has been the capital of the island since 1757. It is also an important financial services centre for the Caribbean and is home to two of the largest banks in the region. The Piarco International Airport is the main airport on the island, connecting the capital to various major global destinations.

Port of Spain was also the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the short-lived West Indies Federation, which united the Caribbean.

The city is also home to the largest container port on the island and is one of several shipping hubs of the Caribbean, exporting both agricultural products and manufactured goods. Bauxite from Guyana is trans-shipped via facilities at Chaguaramas, about west of the city. The pre-lenten Carnival is the city&#x27;s main annual cultural festival and tourist attraction.

Today, Port of Spain is a leading city in the Caribbean region. Trinidad and Tobago hosted the Fifth Summit of the Americas in 2009, whose guests included US president Barack Obama and US secretary of state Hillary Clinton.

Port of Spain is also home to the biggest and most successful stock exchange in the Caribbean, the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange (TTSE). The Nicholas Tower, as well as other skyscrapers, are well known throughout the region. These buildings dominate the city&#x27;s skyline. Some of the tallest skyscrapers in the Caribbean are located in Port of Spain.

== History ==
Port of Spain was founded by the Spanish as . The first settlement was near the site of the Amerindian fishing village of Cumucurapo (&quot;place of the silk cotton trees&quot;), located in the area today known as Mucurapo, west of the city centre. The name Conquerabia is also recorded for an Amerindian settlement in this area; this may have been a separate village, another name for Cumucurapo, or the result of miscomprehension by early Spanish settlers, who established a port here: , later . In 1560, a Spanish garrison was posted near the foot of the Laventille Hills, which today form the city&#x27;s eastern boundary.

The part of today&#x27;s downtown Port of Spain closest to the sea was once an area of tidal mudflats covered by mangroves. The first Spanish buildings here, in the 16th and 17th centuries, were open mud-plastered ajoupas, interspersed between large silk cotton trees and other trees. The fort was a mud-walled enclosure with a shack inside, a flagpole, two or three cannon, and few Spanish soldiers. This was captured during Walter Raleigh&#x27;s expedition in April 1595. The Caribs were transient, travelling to the mainland (now Venezuela) and up the Orinoco River. The French naval commander visited in 1680, and reported that there was no Port of Spain. But in 1690, Spanish governor Don Sebastien de Roteta reported in writing to the King of Spain:
In 1699, the of Trinidad reported to the king that the natives &quot;were in the habit of showering scorn and abuse upon the Holy Faith and ridiculed with jests the efforts of the Holy Fathers&quot;.

By 1757, the old capital, San José de Oruña (modern Saint Joseph), about inland, had fallen into disrepair, and Governor Don Pedro de la Moneda transferred his seat to Port of Spain, which thus became Trinidad&#x27;s de facto capital. The last Spanish Governor of Trinidad, Don José Maria Chacón, devoted much of his time to developing the new capital. He compelled the island&#x27;s Cabildo (governing council) to move to Port of Spain, and he limited its powers to the municipality. The 1783 Cedula of Population, which encouraged the settlement of French Catholics in the island, led to a rapid increase in the town&#x27;s population and its geographical extension westwards.

From the small cluster of buildings at the foot of the Laventille Hills, eleven streets were laid out west to the area bounded by the St. Ann&#x27;s River, thus establishing the grid pattern which has survived in downtown Port of Spain to the present day. Along the sea shore was the Plaza de la Marina (Marine Square), a parade ground. By 1786, the town had a population of about 3,000.

Realising that the St. Ann&#x27;s River, prone to flooding, was impeding the expansion of the town, Chacón had its course diverted in 1787 so that it ran to the east of the city, along the foot of the Laventille Hills. (During the rainy season the river still had a tendency to overflow its banks, flooding parts of the city; over the decades its channel would be widened and paved. During the dry season the water level drops to a trickle; hence its nickname, the East Dry River.) Port of Spain was now able to continue spreading northwards and westwards, encroaching on the surrounding sugar-cane plantations.

In 1797, Trinidad was invaded by a British force under General Sir Ralph Abercromby. The British landed west of Port of Spain, at what is still called Invaders Bay, and marched towards the town. Realising his military resources were inadequate to defend the colony and wishing to avoid unnecessary destruction, Governor Chacón capitulated and was able to negotiate generous terms with Abercromby. Port of Spain remained the capital; the new British colonial government renamed most of the streets after British royalty or military figures, but allowed Chacón Street (which followed the old course of the St. Ann&#x27;s River) to retain its name, in tribute to the former governor.
In 1803, Port of Spain began growing southwards, with the reclamation of the foreshore mudflats, using fill from the Laventille Hills. This began with the area immediately east of the diverted St. Ann&#x27;s River; the district is still called Sea Lots today. Gradually the landfill crept west and the area south of Plaza del Marina became solid land. Further major reclamation efforts took place in the 1840s, the 1870s, and in 1906. In 1935 the Deep Water Harbour Scheme dredged the offshore area along Port of Spain&#x27;s western neighbourhoods, and the dredged material was used to fill in the area south of Woodbrook. Wrightson Road, linking downtown Port of Spain to its western suburbs, was constructed at the same time. These reclaimed lands were originally called Docksite, and were home to US forces during World War II; later a number of government buildings were constructed here.
Port of Spain continued to grow in size and importance during the 19th and early 20th centuries, peaking in size in the 1960s at about 100,000 people. Since then the population within the city limits has declined in size as the downtown area has become increasingly commercial and the suburbs in the valleys north, west, and north-east of the city have grown. Today Port of Spain is the western hub of a metropolitan area stretching from Carenage, west of the city, to Arima, east; this East–West Corridor runs along the southern edge of the Northern Range.

From 1958 to 1962, Port of Spain was the temporary capital of the short-lived West Indies Federation, though there were plans to build a new federal capital at Chaguaramas, on land occupied by the US military base established during World War II. Federation Park, a residential neighbourhood in western Port of Spain intended to house employees of the federal government, is a memorial to that time.

In July 1990, an extremist group held the prime minister and members of parliament hostage for 5 days while rioting and looting shook Port of Spain. The damage was a significant setback to the city&#x27;s commercial district at a time of severe economic hardship, yet businesses returned. In 2005 there was an unprecedented series of small bombings in Port of Spain which caused injuries to bystanders. They ceased in October 2005 but the perpetrator has not been charged.

== Geography ==
Port of Spain measures about 10.4 km2 (c. 4 sq. mi) in area and is located in the northwest section of the island of Trinidad, between the Gulf of Paria, the Northern Range and the Caroni Swamp.

The Northern Range is the range of tall, biodiverse hills across the northern portion of Trinidad and is considered an extension of the Andes mountains of South America, although that is geologically incorrect. Over 465 species of birds, and 100 species of mammals can be found in these mountains, making it one of the most biodiverse mountain ranges in the Caribbean. The Northern Range runs from the Chaguaramas Peninsula in the west to Toco in the east and consists mainly of steeply dipping metasedimentary rocks and lush rainforest containing a wide variety of plants and animal species. Port of Spain lies at the western end and the city climbs into the hills and valleys which are settled and largely deforested. The two tallest peaks are El Cerro del Aripo and El Tucuche which top 900 m (3,000 ft).

The 3278 hectare protected Caroni Swamp has long formed a physical barrier to the city&#x27;s expansion to the south, forcing urban growth relentlessly eastward at the expense of a traffic relieving ring road. This west coast mangrove area is the island&#x27;s second largest wetland after the east coast Nariva Swamp which is almost twice as large. It has well over 160 species of birds, including the national bird, the scarlet ibis. It is one of the country&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions with visitor facilities and regular guided boat tours.

Some of the city lies on land reclaimed from the Gulf of Paria, the calm sheltered bay separating Trinidad from Venezuela, while other parts climb into the hills above the city. Geographically, the Port of Port of Spain is ideal for maritime traffic, providing a natural harbour on Trinidad&#x27;s north-western coasts where adverse weather conditions are extremely rare.

Unlike Chaguanas and San Fernando, Port of Spain has a comparatively cool climate due to the surrounding Northern Range mountains. In the valleys and mountains that surround the northern outskirts of the city, temperature inversion is quite frequent.

=== Cityscape ===
=== Districts ===
* Downtown Port of Spain is the Central Business District of the City of Port of Spain. It is the oldest part of the city and spans between South Quay (to the south), Oxford Street (to the north), the St. Ann&#x27;s River (to the east), and Richmond Street (to the west). It is the cultural and financial center of Trinidad and Tobago and the wider Caribbean region and is home to the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, Port of Spain City Hall, The Red House, Independence Square, Port of Spain Magistrate Court, Hall of Justice, Ministry of National Security, Ministry of Legal Affairs, The Museum of the City of Port of Spain, Holy Trinity Cathedral, St. Marry&#x27;s College, South East Port of Spain Government Secondary School, UWI School Of Business and Applied Studies, Woodfood Square, Colaort Mall, New City Mall, Espermania Plaza, Aboutique Mall, Excellent City Centre, and most of the country&#x27;s and city&#x27;s skyscrapers.
* Woodbrook is a large district which was formerly a sugar estate owned by the Siegert family, was sold to the Town Board in 1911 and developed into a residential neighbourhood and wider district. Woodbrook is known for its cultural gingerbread houses and many parks and green spaces and a distinctive architectural heritage.
* Saint James is north of Woodbrook and west of Saint Clair and is the last district to be incorporated into the city limits. Since the late 19th century, Saint James has been the center of Port of Spain&#x27;s Indian population and hence many streets in the district has been named after cities and districts in South Asia. The district is the city&#x27;s main nightlife district and is given the nickname &quot;The City that never sleeps&quot;.
* Newtown is a district in north Port of Spain and is home to many churches and schools within the city. The Newtown district has well evolved into a developed business district with many diplomatic mission being situated there.
* Saint Clair is an upscale business and residential district between the Queen&#x27;s Park Savannah and the Maraval River. It is home to most of the city&#x27;s grandest and largest mansions and also home to the Magnificent Seven Houses. Federation Park and Ellerslie Park, two of Port of Spain&#x27;s most upscale neighbourhoods are also located in the district.
* Belmont is a district in the city located at the foot of the Laventille Hills, was the city&#x27;s first suburb. In the 1840s–50s, parts of the area were settled by Africans rescued by the Royal Navy from illegal slave ships. In the 1880–90s, the population swelled rapidly, and the characteristic Belmont street pattern of narrow, winding lanes developed. The black professional class built large homes in Belmont, as they were excluded from the more expensive neighbourhoods such as St. Clair and Maraval; Belmont became known as &quot;the Black St. Clair&quot;. Many of these large homes have been renovated and converted to business use, but some remain in family hands. Belmont currently is a lower-middle to middle-class residential neighbourhood. It was the birthplace and early home of many important Carnival designers and bandleaders. Belmont has 9,035 inhabitants.

==== Suburbs and Surrounding Towns ====
* Laventille is largely working class neighborhood located east of the St. Ann&#x27;s River. For visitors entering Port of Spain from the airport, this neighbourhood dominates the city as it spreads over the surrounding hills. The area is unfortunately portrayed as one of the most violent in the country due to drug, gun and turf wars among gangs (financed arguably by illicit drug wealth which does not remain in the community), but it is also the birthplace of the steelpan and, some would argue, the spiritual capital of the city since calypso. Steelpan and carnival are the life source of many Trinidadians who live in the capital. South of Laventille are Beetham Estate and Sea Lots, two other economically depressed neighbourhoods.

Immediately north and northwest of Port of Spain lie the suburbs of Cascade, St. Ann&#x27;s and Maraval. The last one falls outside the municipal boundary, but is sometimes considered an extension of the city. St. Ann&#x27;s is notable for being the location of the Prime Minister&#x27;s official residence and diplomatic centre. Cascade, a mainly suburban area with treed lot type housing is located to the south-eastern area of St. Ann&#x27;s. Cascade borders St. Ann&#x27;s by a hill named Mount Hololo, a neighbourhood of both middle class and exclusive housing developments.

Maraval is home to the exclusive Trinidad Country Club and right next door to the popular Long Circular Mall. Further afield, west of Diego Martin, lies the suburb of Westmoorings, which is known for its expensive Miami style highrise apartments facing the seafront. One of Trinidad&#x27;s poshest shopping centres, The Falls at West-Mall, lies at the centre of these developments. As you head west beyond Carenage settlement is sparse, however the peninsula known as Chaguaramas, which was once a large US Army Base, has become a mecca for hundreds of international cruisers and a world major yacht storage and repair hub.

To the east along the East–West Corridor, also falling outside city limits, lie the large towns of San Juan, Tunapuna and Arima. With congestion rendering downtown inaccessible during peak hours, major shopping centres like Valsayn Shopping Centre, Grand Bazaar and Trincity Mall have sprung up at highway intersections. The last two are noted for being among the largest shopping centres in the country and in the Caribbean, with of commercial space in each. Two large Universities have been established in the eastern section of the E-W corridor – the regional University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus and the multi campus local University of Trinidad and Tobago whose main campus is on the Arima outskirts.

=== Climate ===
The city has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) characterized by warm to hot temperatures year-round, with little seasonal variation due to its proximity to the equator, though nighttime temperatures dip somewhat during the winter months from January to March. Temperatures typically range from , rarely above or below . The wet season lasts from May to December, and the dry season lasts from January to April of the following year. Between December and February, it can become mild at night.

=== Urban structure ===
Port of Spain&#x27;s official population is relatively small, and reflects the narrow city boundaries including the central business district and a number of economically depressed and a few upscale adjoining suburbs. In addition to the official population, the adjacent East–West Corridor conurbation has a population close to 600,000 people and the &quot;big city&quot; feel with its suburban car dominated commuting. The corridor is the built-up area of north Trinidad stretching from the capital, Port of Spain, east to Arima. It includes the towns of Barataria, San Juan, St. Joseph, Curepe, St. Augustine, Tunapuna, Tacarigua, Arouca, and Five Rivers, once distinct communities and now districts within a continuous urban area. For the most part it runs along the Eastern Main Road, between the Churchill–Roosevelt Highway and the foothills of the Northern Range.

=== Parks ===
==== Queen&#x27;s Park Savannah ====


Port of Spain&#x27;s largest open space—and the world&#x27;s largest traffic roundabout—is the Queen&#x27;s Park Savannah, known colloquially simply as &quot;the Savannah&quot;. It occupies about of level land, and the distance around the perimeter is about . Once sugar land, it was bought by the town council in 1817 from the Peschier family (except for a small parcel near its centre that served as the Peschier cemetery, which remains in private hands).

At first it was used as a vast cattle pasture in what was then the town&#x27;s suburbs, but by the middle of the 19th century it had become established as a park. Until the early 1990s, horse racing was held frequently at the Savannah race track, and it also contains several cricket, football and rugby pitches. Apart from a ring of trees round its perimeter, the Savannah was never really landscaped, except for the small area in its northwest corner called the Hollows, a former reservoir now drained and planted with flowering shrubs.

Immediately north of the Savannah—also the northern limit of the city of Port of Spain—are the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Emperor Valley Zoo, President&#x27;s House (recently abandoned after one end fell down), the official residence of the prime minister, and Queen&#x27;s Hall, the city&#x27;s major performing arts venue. Lady Chancellor Road, which ascends the hills overlooking the Savannah, is one of Port of Spain&#x27;s most exclusive residential areas and is the current home of former West Indies cricketer and record breaking batsman, Brian Lara.

On the Savannah&#x27;s southern side is the Grand Stand, formerly used for viewing horse races, now used for various cultural events, most notably Carnival, when a temporary North Stand and raised stage are constructed in front of the Grand Stand, creating the &quot;Big Yard&quot;, Carnival&#x27;s central location since the early 20th century (previously, the main viewing area for Carnival was in downtown Port of Spain). From this location the Parade of Bands is broadcast live to the nation on Carnival Monday and Tuesday; it is also the venue for the Calypso Monarch and Carnival King and Queen Competitions and the finals of the Panorama steelpan competition. The architecturally soothing arches and curves of the Port of Spain National Academy for the Performing Arts (see picture and caption) dominate the south boundary of the Savannah between the green trimmed landmarks of Memorial Park (in remembrance of fallen soldiers during World Wars I and II) and the gingerbread styled, limestone built, colourful splendour of the Knowsley Ministry of Foreign Affairs Building.

The western edge of the Savannah, along Maraval Road, is the location of the Magnificent Seven, a group of late Victorian and Edwardian buildings built in an eccentric and flamboyant variety of styles. These are the recently well restored Queen&#x27;s Royal College; the residences of the Anglican bishop and the Roman Catholic archbishop; Whitehall, once a private residence, then the office of the prime minister from 1963 to 2010; Mille Fleurs, once a private residence, is undergoing full restoration as a public museum and headquarters for the National Heritage Trust and was sold to the Government in 1979; Roomor, an ornate black-and-white château-like building that remains a private residence; and Stollmeyer&#x27;s Castle, a turreted house supposedly modelled on Balmoral Castle. The slow pace of building restorations over the years remains a concern.
== Housing ==
Housing in Port of Spain ranges from luxurious waterfront apartments to board houses lacking indoor plumbing and motor vehicular access. Continued pressure for expansion of commercial development in Woodbrook and uptown POS (Port of Spain proper) has led to a rapid rate of decline in the city&#x27;s population over the past 4 decades. The private development scheme at Damien street Woodbrook recently provided 350 luxury-apartments, but those are unaffordable to most, even though they were originally intended for the general population.

To address the problem, East Port of Spain Development Company was formed in 2005 with a mandate to develop and redevelop a zone in east Port of Spain to improve the economic, social and physical environment of those areas. Large parts of Port of Spain&#x27;s Eastern entrance have been cleared of old warehouses and substandard housing.

There are several new government housing projects in the city which are under construction or planned.

== Government ==
Port of Spain is administered by the Port of Spain City Corporation. There are 12 councillors and 4 aldermen. The mayor is elected from the membership of the council.
The council is presided over by the mayor, who is effectively the chief custodian of the city. It formulates policy and gives direction for the running of the city through a number of standing committees which each meet at least once per month.

Decisions are then ratified at the statutory meeting of the council, which takes place on the last Wednesday of each month. The policies and directives of the council are executed by the administrative arm of the corporation, which is headed by the chief executive officer and has under her charge a number of senior officers and a workforce of about 3,000 daily-paid and 300 monthly-paid employees.

The chief executive officer and her staff are public servants functioning under the regulations of the Statutory Authorities Service Commissions Ordinance.

=== Mayors ===
Following an election in 1887, Michel Maxwell Philip became the mayor, a position that had previously been held by only whites. Bridget Brereton wrote in her 2002 book &quot;Race Relations in Colonial Trinidad 1870–1900&quot; that &quot;perhaps this marks the emergence of the coloured man as a political force in Trinidad&quot;.

Chinua Alleyne is the current mayor of Port of Spain.

The electoral districts are:
* St. James East
* St. James West
* Woodbrook
* Northern Port of Spain
* Belmont East
* Belmont North &amp; West
* Southern Port of Spain
* East Dry River
* St. Ann&#x27;s River South
* St. Ann&#x27;s River Central
* St. Ann&#x27;s River North
* Belmont South

Port of Spain became a &quot;city&quot; in 1914; the ordinance was passed on 29 May and was proclaimed by the Governor on 25 June 1914. The first city councillors were elected on 2 November. Among them were oil pioneer Randolph Rust, lawyer and social activist Emmanuel Mzumbo Lazare and Dr. Enrique Prada, who was elected chairman by the council and became the first mayor of the City of Port of Spain.

For several convocations all city MPs are from People&#x27;s National Movement.

== Economy ==

Port of Spain is a shopping and business centre for much of the country. Most government offices are also located in the city and many important government services can only be accessed in the Ministry offices located downtown. Within recent years, local banks headquartered here have helped it become a financial centre for the Caribbean and Central America region. Two of the largest banks in the Caribbean, Republic Bank, Trinidad and Tobago Limited and Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (RBTT, reacquired by the Royal Bank in 2008) are headquartered here or base their Caribbean operations in the city.

Trinidad&#x27;s economy is based on natural gas and oil. No heavy industrial sites are located in Port of Spain, but a major oil refinery and many petrochemical and iron and steel plants exist or are planned for sites south of it and closer to San Fernando. However, the oil and gas majors and some service companies have located their headquarters in the city to be in close proximity to government services, infrastructure and the high quality of life many citizens of Port of Spain enjoy. Some of the oil and gas company headquarters located in Port of Spain (many others are found in San Fernando &amp; Point Lisas) include BPTT, BGTT (British Gas), BHP Billiton, EOG Resources, Fluor, Repsol YPF, Atlantic LNG and Baker Hughes.
Trinidad and Tobago is considered one of the wealthiest nations in the Caribbean and some of this wealth is on display in Port of Spain. High-income proceeds from the international sale of natural gas has aided the country in the Port of Spain International Waterfront project constructed on former Port Authority Land.
The Port of Port of Spain is the country&#x27;s major port for containerized shipping followed by the Port of Point Lisas.
Cruise ships also dock at the port which has:
public international cargo-handling facilities for containerised, break-bulk, Roll-on/Roll-off and dry/liquid bulk cargo
The Port also operates the ferry service between Trinidad &amp; Tobago, as agents of the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.
Tourism is targeted for expansion and is a growing sector in the city&#x27;s economy, but it is not as important as in other Caribbean cities. Port of Spain has a large agricultural market, known as the &quot;central market&quot; where food produced in the surrounding hinterland is traded.

== Education ==

 In 1999/2000 there were 40 Government/Assisted schools located in the Port of Spain Administrative Area. There were 17,957 students enrolled in primary schools and 15,641 enrolled in secondary school. In secondary schools, 7,567 were male and 8,074 were female.
Education is free and compulsory up to secondary school. Port of Spain school leavers, as citizens of Trinidad and Tobago, do not pay tuition to study at local &amp; regional public and private tertiary institutions except for graduate studies where they pay a heavily subsidised fee. There are several prominent tertiary institutions in Port of Spain and environs, in particular the St. Augustine campus of the three-campus, Caribbean-wide University of the West Indies, which had a local campus enrollment of 15,571 in academic year 2007/2008. The University of Trinidad and Tobago has several campuses and institutes in the greater Port of Spain area including the Chaguaramas Centre for Maritime Studies.

== Demographics and architecture ==

Port of Spain has a population of 18,008 males and 19,066 females, with 5,694 businesses and is home to 12,333 households with an average size of 2.9 according to the 2011 census. The city experienced an average annual growth rate of −2.3% between the censuses of 2000 and 2011

Port of Spain&#x27;s diverse population reflects two centuries of immigration and this shows in the architecture of its buildings. The city features French colonial &#x27;ginger bread&#x27; style houses, buildings with New Orleans reminiscent wrought-iron railings and wooden fretwork set beside modern high-rise towers and strip malls with a mish-mash of gothic-style cathedrals, mosques and Hindu temples testifying to the diversity of cultures. It is home to African, Indian, French, English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Spanish, Portuguese, Venezuelan, Colombian, Bajan, Guyanese, Jamaican, Guadeloupean, Martinicquan, Dominican, Saint Lucian, Grenadian, Bahamian, Belizean, Surinamese, Chinese, Jewish, and Arab immigrants, most of them arriving since the Spanish Cedula of Population of 1783. Prominent Port of Spain citizens include Derek Walcott (Nobel Prize Literature 1992) and former West Indies cricketer Brian Lara.


=== Ancestry ===

== Culture and entertainment ==
Trinidad has a rich tapestry of cultures which create occasions for celebrations beyond many&#x27;s expectations for a small Caribbean island; thus there is much to see and do after work hours in Port of Spain, even long after the annual Carnival celebration. While the popularity of the major shopping area around Frederick Street as a nightspot centre has remained steady or declined, expansion of entertainment venues into the malls and outlying towns has occurred. St. James, &#x27;uptown&#x27; Port of Spain (St. Clair and Woodbrook) have seen a boom in nightclubs, sports bars and fine dining restaurants as workers from government offices and large corporations disgorge on evenings from high-rise headquarters built in newly commercialized formerly upscale neighbourhoods.
=== Sports ===

Port of Spain hosts major sporting venues including the Queen&#x27;s Park Oval, Hasely Crawford Stadium, the Jean Pierre Complex and various sporting fields on the Queen&#x27;s Park Savannah. Port of Spain was among the host cities of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The city hosted the 2009 Pan American Junior Athletics Championship and the finals of the 2001 FIFA Under-17 World Cup and 2010 FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup.

=== Green spaces, squares and places ===
There are a number of well placed green spaces which have been preserved in Port of Spain. Many of them are referred to as squares or parks. Although some of the Squares have retained some of their &quot;original framework&quot; which consists of lengths of metal placed in concrete, which surround the exterior of the space, with each Square having at least four gates. These gates are positioned on the corners so as to allow the main paths of the Square to form an X. Some of the Squares have not retained nor do they give the appearance of having had the lengths of metal placed on its exterior points as lines of demarcation. By virtue of the gates to the Squares not being closed at any time and the lack of metal enclosures on others, there is the impression that these Squares and places are also open to the public at all hours. In some of the Squares, there are street lights to illuminate the interior of the square at nighttime.

Some of the more famous squares are as follows:

Lord Harris Square which is located between Pembroke, New and Abercromby Sts. was &quot;established in the early 1900s, (and) is named as a tribute to Lord Harris, governor of Trinidad between 1846 and 1854&quot;.

Woodford Square is located between Frederick, Abercromby and Hart Sts. It is bounded by the Old National Library, The Red House and the Trinity Cathedral. Woodford Square is sometimes referred to as &quot;University of Woodford Sq because of its occasional use by soapbox speakers and gospel preachers, this is the symbolic center of downtown. Dr Eric Williams, Trinidad and Tobago’s first prime minister, lectured to the masses here about the importance of sovereignty, which later led to the country’s independence from Britain&quot;.
&quot;Woodford Square was formerly known as Brunswick Square.&quot;. However prior to 1808, &quot;Woodford Square was first known as the Place of Souls by the native Indians who fought a bloody battle on this open space. ... With the coming of the French settlers to the island, they called the Place of souls – Place Des Ames. Place Des Ames means Place of souls. Place Des Ames later became known as Brunswick Square. Brunswick Square was used as a parade ground for soldiers. Many of these soldiers were Germans. Brunswick is a German name, and so it is believed that this open space was named after the German soldiers who used it.&quot;

Marine Square, while not a designated green space serves as a meeting place for many visitors coming into Port of Spain. &quot;Plaza De La Marina was the name given to the area extending from the Wharf in the west to the Roman Catholic Cathedral to the east.&quot; &quot;When the British came in 1797 the name was changed to Marine Square... In the 1880s a fountain was erected in the middle of the square.&quot; &quot;1962: Marine Square becomes Independence Square.&quot; In the 1980s &quot;this area was the site of the statue of Captain Arthur Andrew Cipriani (1875–1945), one of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s celebrated political leaders and sportsmen...The area was then renamed the Brian Lara Promenade in honor of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s most celebrated cricketer and record breaking batsman, Brian Charles Lara (1974–). The Promenade was completed in three phases and finally opened in August 1995&quot;.

A little more of the history on Marine Square is revealed in the following extract &quot;the square was the early home of the Syrian/ Lebanese communities when they started to arrive in Trinidad during the early 20th century. They were fleeing from the harsh religious and political persecution of the Turks who had conquered their lands. The original number of these immigrants was small but it grew larger when a confrontation erupted between a Muslim religious sect and the Christian Maronites.

Annette Rahael, a third generation Syrian living in Trinidad explained, &quot;when the early settlers arrived and saw the cathedral on Marine Square they immediately claimed it as the House of God and adopted Catholicism as their religious affiliation, since there were no churches in Trinidad celebrating the liturgy of the Antiochan Orthodox religion which they had practised in their country&quot;.

Tamarind Square – This square is located between Nelson and George Sts. It is located in close proximity to one of the local banks which was established in Trinidad and Tobago, &quot;Workers Bank&quot;. This bank merged with the Trinidad Cooperative Bank and the National Commercial Bank to form First Citizens&#x27; Bank.

Victoria Square is located on Duke St. West, Park St, and has been categorised as a Park located in Woodbrook according to WOW City. However, because of its location on Duke St. West which starts on Wrightson Road and ends on Charlotte St, it is included here.

Kew Place is one of the smallest &quot;squares&quot; in Port of Spain. &quot;Kew Place has a length of 0.12 kilometres&quot; and is large enough to hold a statue of Gandhi. It is located just opposite the main entrance to Lapeyrouse Cemetery on Philip Street and is within walking distance of Victoria Square.

=== Arts, entertainment, and nightlife ===
==== Nightlife and restaurants ====
Port of Spain offers a range of nightclubs and entertainment complexes. International and regional performers such as Beyoncé, Chris Brown, Sean Paul, Rihanna, Cascada, Akon, Usher, Maroon 5, Kumar Sanu and natively born Trinidadian International Super Star Nicki Minaj to name a very few, have visited Port of Spain.

A great variety of restaurants including Italian, Mexican, Lebanese, Thai, Venezuelan-Panyol, French, Japanese, Chinese, Creole, American and Indian can be found in Port of Spain with many concentrated on Ariapita Avenue, a popular entertainment strip, which also includes a Jazz Lounge and a Wine Tasting restaurant. MovieTowne&#x27;s Fiesta Plaza, a tribute to Bourbon Street New Orleans, on the city&#x27;s foreshore, features many new restaurants, open air dining and a bandstand with live entertainment. Port of Spain&#x27;s restaurants provide a wide range of local and international cuisines, accompanied by the traditional fast food chains. Many of the city&#x27;s restaurants can be sampled at the Taste T&amp;T Food Festival hosted at the Jean Pierre Sports Complex annually in May.

==== Arts ====
Port of Spain is also a cultural hub for the country. Regular dance and theatre productions occur at:
* The Little Carib at the corner of Robert and White Street which has provided a cultural centre for Woodbrook for the past fifty years. It is one of the oldest theatres in the country, established by local dance legend, Beryl McBurnie, in 1947.
* Queen&#x27;s Hall was built in 1959 through the efforts of the music community led by Mrs May Johnstone, a music teacher and partially funded by the Government of Trinidad &amp; Tobago. It is designed as a multi purpose facility to accommodate theatrical presentations and various community activities including sport and has seating for 782. The Hall is located on of land in St. Ann&#x27;s. Its eminent neighbours are the President&#x27;s House on one side and the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence on the other.
* The Central Bank Auditorium at the Eric Williams Plaza constructed in 1986 not only to serve the Bank&#x27;s needs, but also as a civic contribution aimed at enhancing the performing arts in Trinidad and Tobago. The Auditorium is located at the South-East corner of the Central Bank building. It has a seating capacity for 400 and provides computerised lighting and sound controls.
* The Port of Spain National Academy for the Performing Arts (see picture and caption) is the city&#x27;s newests Arts centre. The facility features a 1500-seat performance hall and a hotel for visiting performers. The performance centre was completed in November 2009 and hosted Queen Elizabeth II and other leaders of the Commonwealth for the opening of the Commonwealth meeting in Port of Spain.
* The proposed National Carnival and Entertainment Centre which is a locally designed 15–18,000 seat cultural centre to be built in the Queen&#x27;s Park Savannah.
Port of Spain is the centre of one of the largest Carnivals in the world, with tens of thousands participating in the pre-Lenten street party.

One of Port of Spain&#x27;s most prominent artisans is Peter Minshall, who creates &#x27;mas&#x27; or masquerade costumes for Trinidad&#x27;s annual carnival. Internationally, he helped design the opening awards ceremonies for the 1987 Pan American Games, the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, the 1994 Football World Cup and the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.

==== Museums ====
The National Museum and Art Gallery is the country&#x27;s most important museum. It displays depictions of national festivals, Carnival, life during World War II and artifacts from the country&#x27;s earliest settlers, the Amerindians. There are also displays by leading local and international artists, with exhibitions being mounted at various times during the year. The museum was established in 1892 and was originally called the Royal Victoria Institute, as it was built as part of the preparation for Queen Victoria&#x27;s jubilee.

The National Museum has two smaller branch museums:

Fort San Andres which is located on South Quay, opposite City Gate. According to Geoffrey MacLean, in the Trinidad Express Newspaper in December 2014, &quot;the fort, which replaced a mound of mud and wood that served as the only defence of Port of Spain, was, when completed in 1787, located offshore and linked to the mainland by a wooden bridge.&quot;

The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service Museum which is located at the Old Police Headquarters on St. Vincent Street. This Museum is in close proximity to the Old Cabildo Building, called the Law Museum as of August 2012 by the Guardian TT when it was reopened, the Ministry of Legal Affairs, and the Colonial Life Insurance Co Ltd building, known as CLICO, and opposite to CLICO is the RED HOUSE.

==== Crime ====
Port of Spain and its immediate environs have a higher crime rate than any other part of Trinidad. Homicides countrywide rose from fewer than 50 in the 1980s, to 97 in 1998, then to 360 in 2006 (30 murders per 100,000 persons). It rose to approximately 500 in 2008 but decreased significantly in 2010 and 2011. For the year 2012, the rate reached 354 murders per 100,000 persons, but with a state of emergency being imposed by government for approximately three months. For the year 2013 the rate reached 407. Until July of the 2014, the number reaches 207 homicides.

Many murders are drug and gang related, especially in the depressed communities of East Port of Spain. The police administration has responded by improving the working conditions of officers, increasing the use of forensic evidence and surveillance technology (CCTV cameras) as well as hiring overseas experts.

Reports of kidnappings for ransom which were on the rise a few years ago have declined dramatically since 2006. However, theft and violent crimes remain prevalent to this date, while crime and the perception of crime continues to hamper the economic prospects of the city.

In 2022, the U.S. Department of State updated the Trinidad and Tobago travel advisory first to Level 2: Exercise increased precautions and then to Level 3: Reconsider travel in November 2022. Violent crime was cited as the reason for this advisory, specifically kidnapping and terrorism as well as shootings in Port of Spain specifically. The advisory specifies that U.S. government personnel are prohibited from travelling to Laventille, Beetham, Sea Lots, Cocorite, and the interior of Queens’ Park Savannah; after dark, they are prohibited from travelling to Downtown Port of Spain, Fort George Overlook and all beaches.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Health ===
Five Regional Health Authorities (RHAs) deliver public health care services to the people of Trinidad and Tobago. RHAs are autonomous bodies that own and operate health facilities in their respective regions. The Port of Spain municipality is served by the North West Regional Health Authority (NWRHA).
The NWRHA administers and manages the Port of Spain General Hospital, St. Ann&#x27;s Psychiatric Hospital, St. James Medical Complex and 16 health centres that serve a catchment area of 500,000 people. The Port of Spain General Hospital is one of the major trauma centres in the nation and in the Southern Caribbean.

The demand for speedy quality health service has led to the establishment of private hospitals. The major ones are:
* Westshore Medical Centre, Cocorite
* St. Clair Medical Centre, St. Clair
* The Seventh-day Adventist Community Hospital, Cocorite

In the greater Port of Spain area, the public and fully state-funded Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex, run by the North Central RHA, is also a major provider of medical services. It includes the Wendy Fitzwilliam Children&#x27;s Ward and the Mt. Hope Women&#x27;s Hospital.

=== Transport ===
==== Road ====
Port of Spain has one of the most dense and complex systems of roadways in Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean. 
Transportation in and out of Port of Spain is plagued by heavy traffic delays at morning and evening rush hour. Port of Spain&#x27;s major roadways are equipped with CCTV cameras, road signage, lane markings, cat eyes, and other safety features.
* Eastern Entrance: Traffic enters the city from the east along the six-lane Churchill–Roosevelt Highway which ends at Barataria, just east of the city and becomes the Beetham Highway for the remainder of the journey into Port of Spain, then meets Broadway and is called Wrightson Road until Invader&#x27;s Bay. It is six lanes from Broadway to Sackville Street, and four lanes for the remainder of its route. Alternatively, traffic can turn north at Barataria and enter the city via the two-lane mountainous Lady Young Road. The Eastern Main Road runs parallel to the highway and enters the city at the eastern end of Independence Square. The Priority Bus Route (which is dedicated to public and private bus and minibus traffic and runs along the former Trinidad Government Railway line) enters the city at City Gate.
* Western Entrance: Traffic from the west enters the city through the Western Main Road and the four-lane Audrey Jeffers Highway. Several narrow mountain roads allow for alternate entry points from the west.
There are also a few major inner-city roadways. Ariapita Avenue is one of them, being the center of the city&#x27;s nightlife and at the center of a revitalization project. The Queen&#x27;s Park Savannah is said to be the world&#x27;s largest roundabout and has a perimeter roadway that is technically a collection of roadways all providing access to the Savannah&#x27;s environs. Tragarete Road is another inner-city roadway that runs into St. James, also providing access to the Queen&#x27;s Park Oval and One Woodbrook Place. 

==== Public transport ====
City Gate serves as a transportation hub for public buses and private mini-buses (locally known as maxi-taxis). City Gate is located on South Quay just south of Independence Square. The PTSC facilities and service have been plagued with issues for a period of time, but recently there have been upgrades to the service and facilities including free WiFi on coach buses, a new coach waiting area at City Gate and addition of new buses to the fleet.

A ferry service links Port of Spain with Scarborough, Tobago and a water taxi service, restarted in December 2008 (Trinidad&#x27;s west coast towns were once served by steamship), links it with San Fernando. The ferry terminal is located at South Quay while the water taxi terminal is part of the Port of Spain International Waterfront Centre.

==== Airport ====
Like the rest of the island of Trinidad, Port of Spain is served by the Piarco International Airport located in Piarco, approximately east of Port of Spain via the Churchill Roosevelt Highway. 

==== Upgrade plans ====
To ease the current traffic woes that result in two- to three-hour commutes during rush hours, a number of projects are in various stages of implementation. The upgrading of the Churchill–Roosevelt highway to a grade separated expressway and the extension of water ferry services from Port of Spain to the major urban hubs along the west coast are particularly notable.

=== Utilities ===

Electricity generation is handled by Powergen, a privately owned electricity producer, while electrical distribution is handled by the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission (T&amp;TEC) a state owned enterprise. Powergen had one natural gas-fired generation plant located on Wrightson Road in Port of Spain however this plant was closed on 14 January 2016 ending 121 years of power generation in Port of Spain. Port of Spain is supplied by power from power generation facilities located in Point Lisas, Penal and La Brea.

Telecommunications are regulated by the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT). It has successfully de-monopolised the industry, granting several new mobile licenses in 2005 for two private companies, Digicel and Laqtel to offer wireless service in competition with TSTT. Laqtel which would have offered Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s first CDMA (3G) network had its license revoked by the TATT in 2008. Fixed-line telephone service and broadband was also once a monopoly controlled by Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago (TSTT). Flow alongside Digicel also now offers these services to its wide customer base. LTE-A, cable and fiber broadband services in excess of 100 Mbit/s are available throughout the city. There are Wi-Fi hotspots at all major hotels and for free in coffee shops, malls and at the airport. Broadband and mobile competition has resulted in lower rates and wider availability of services for consumers.
Water and sewerage are under the purview of the Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (WaSA). Much of the city&#x27;s water supply comes from the Caroni Arena Dam located in the Arena Forest Reserve near Brazil Village. The Caroni Arena Dam supplies the Caroni Water Treatment Plant located opposite the Piarco International Airport Southern Terminal. This Caroni Water Treatment Plant was upgraded in 2000 to a total daily production of 75 m.g.d.

Another important facility, the new Beetham Waste Water Treatment Plant, began to treat domestic waste to international standards in 2004. The plant serves customers within Greater Port-of Spain and environs from Pt. Cumana in the west to Mt. Hope in the east including Diego Martin and Maraval.

Most solid waste is disposed of in the Beetham Landfill, commonly known as &quot;La Basse&quot;.

<doc id="57395" wikidata="Q3799" url="?curid=57395" title="Porto-Novo">
<text>, , ; ; ; also known as Hogbonu and Ajashe) is the capital and second-largest city of Benin. The commune covers an area of and as of 2002 had a population of 223,552 people.

Situated on an inlet of the Gulf of Guinea, in the southeastern portion of the country, the city was originally developed as a port for the transatlantic slave trade led by the Portuguese Empire. It is Benin&#x27;s second-largest city, and although it is the official capital, where the national legislature sits, the larger city of Cotonou is the seat of government, where most of the government buildings are situated and government departments operate.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Porto-Novo&quot; is of Portuguese origin, literally meaning &quot;New Port&quot;. It remains untranslated in French, the national language of Benin.

==History==

Porto-Novo was once a tributary of the Yoruba kingdom of Oyo, which had offered it protection from the neighbouring Fon, who were expanding their influence and power in the region. The Yoruba community in Porto-Novo today remains one of the two ethnicities aboriginal to the city. The city was originally called &quot;Ajashe&quot; (Àjàṣẹ́ in Yoruba orthography) by the Yorubas, and &quot;Hogbonu&quot; by the Gun.

Although historically the original inhabitants of the area were Yoruba speaking, there seems to have been a wave of migration from the region of Allada further west in the 1600s, which brought Te-Agbalin (or Te Agdanlin) and his group to the region of Ajashe in 1688. 

In 1730, the Portuguese Eucaristo de Campos named the city &quot;Porto-Novo&quot; because of its resemblance to the city of Porto. It was originally developed as a port for the slave trade.

In 1861, the British, who were active in nearby Nigeria, bombarded the city, which persuaded the Kingdom of Porto-Novo to accept French protection in 1863. The neighbouring Kingdom of Dahomey objected to French involvement in the region and war broke out between the two states. In 1883, Porto-Novo was incorporated into the French &quot;colony of Dahomey and its dependencies&quot; and in 1900, it became Dahomey&#x27;s capital city. As a consequence, a community that had previously exhibited endoglossic bilingualism now began to exhibit exoglossic bilingualism, with the addition of French to the language repertoire of the city&#x27;s inhabitants. Unlike the city&#x27;s earlier Gun migrants, however, the French sought to impose their language in all spheres of life and completely stamp out the use and proliferation of indigenous languages.
The kings of Porto-Novo continued to rule in the city, both officially and unofficially, until the death of the last king, Alohinto Gbeffa, in 1976. From 1908, the king held the title of &quot;Chef supérieur&quot;.

Many Afro-Brazilians settled in Porto-Novo following their return to Africa after emancipation in Brazil. Brazilian architecture and foods are important to the city&#x27;s cultural life.

Under French colonial rule, flight across the new border to British-ruled Nigeria in order to avoid harsh taxation, military service and forced labour was common. Of note is the fact that the Nigeria-Benin southern border area arbitrarily cuts through contiguous areas of Yoruba and Egun-speaking people. A combination of the aforementioned facts, coupled with the fact that the city itself lies within the sphere of Nigerian socioeconomic influence, have given Porto-Novians a preference for some measure of bi-nationality or dual citizenship, with the necessary linguistic consequences; for example, Nigerian home video films in Yoruba with English subtitles have become popular in Porto-Novo and its suburbs.

==Seat of government==
Benin&#x27;s parliament (&quot;Assemblée nationale&quot;) is in Porto-Novo, the official capital, but Cotonou is the seat of government and houses most of the governmental ministries.

== Economy ==

The region around Porto-Novo produces palm oil, cotton and kapok. Petroleum was discovered off the coast of the city in 1968 and has become an important export since the 1990s. Porto-Novo has a cement factory. The city is home to a branch of the Banque Internationale du Bénin, a major bank in Benin, and the Ouando Market.

== Transport ==

Porto-Novo is served by an extension of the Bénirail train system. Privately owned motorcycle taxis known as &quot;zemijan&quot; are used throughout the city. The city is located about away from Cotonou Airport, which has flights to major cities in West Africa and Europe.

== Demographics ==
Porto-Novo had an enumerated population of 264,320 in 2013. The residents are mostly Yoruba and Gun people as well as people from other parts of the country, and from neighbouring Nigeria.

Population trend:
*1979: 133,168 (census)
*1992: 179,138 (census)
*2002: 223,552 (census)
*2013: 264,320 (census)

== Geography and climate ==
Porto-Novo has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;) with consistently hot and humid conditions and two wet seasons: a long wet season from March to July and a shorter rain season in September and October. The city’s location on the edge of the Dahomey Gap makes it much drier than would be expected so close to the equator, although it is less dry than Accra or Lomé.
==Administrative divisions==

* 1st arrondissement
* 2nd arrondissement
* 3rd arrondissement
* 4th arrondissement
* 5th arrondissement

==Culture==
*The Porto-Novo Museum of Ethnography contains a large collection of Yoruba masks, as well as items on the history of the city and of Benin.
*King Toffa&#x27;s Palace (also known as the &quot;Musée Honmé&quot; and the Royal Palace), now a museum, shows what life was like for African royalty. The palace and the surrounding district was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on October 31, 1996 in the Cultural category.
*&quot;Jardin Place Jean Bayol&quot; is a large plaza which contains a statue of the first King of Porto-Novo.
*The Da Silva Museum is a museum of Beninese history. It shows what life was like for the returning Afro-Brazilians.
*The &quot;palais de Gouverneur&quot; (governor&#x27;s palace) is the home of the national legislature.
*The Isèbayé Foundation is a museum of Voodoo and Beninese history.

==Music==
Adjogan music is endemic to Porto-Novo. The style of music is played on an alounloun, a stick with metallic rings attached which jingle in time with the beating of the stick. The alounloun is said to descend from the staff of office of King Te-Agdanlin and was traditionally played to honour the King and his ministers. The music is also played in the city&#x27;s Roman Catholic churches, but the royal bird crest symbol has been replaced with a cross.

==Sports==
The &quot;Stade Municipal&quot; and the &quot;Stade Charles de Gaulle&quot; are the largest football stadiums in the city.

== Places of worship ==
Among the places of worship, Christian churches are predominant: Roman Catholic Diocese of Porto Novo (Catholic Church), Protestant Methodist Church in Benin (World Methodist Council), Celestial Church of Christ, Union of Baptist Churches of Benin (Baptist World Alliance), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques, most notably the Grand Mosque. There are also several Voodoo temples in the city.

<text>Praia (, Portuguese for &quot;beach&quot;) is the capital and largest city of Cape Verde. Located on the southern coast of Santiago island, within the Sotavento Islands group, the city is the seat of the Praia Municipality. Praia is the political, economic and cultural center of Cape Verde.

==History==
The island of Santiago was discovered by António da Noli in 1460. The first settlement on the island was Ribeira Grande (Cidade Velha). The village &quot;Praia de Santa Maria&quot; was first mentioned around 1615 and grew near the natural harbour. The ports of Santiago were important ports of call for ships sailing between Portugal and the Portuguese colonies in Africa and South America. Between the end of the 16th century and the end of the 18th century, both Ribeira Grande and Praia suffered many pirate attacks, including those by Francis Drake (1585) and Jacques Cassard (1712).

Due to its strategic position on a plateau it had better protection against pirate attacks, which gave it a large advantage over the older city of Ribeira Grande (Cidade Velha). It gradually superseded Cidade Velha to become the most important settlement of Cape Verde, and became the capital of Cape Verde in 1770. The naval battle of Porto Praya took place at Praia Harbour on 16 April 1781, as Portugal was neutral, it involved Great Britain and France and ended in a tactical draw and French strategic victory. Praia was the first stop of Charles Darwin&#x27;s voyage with in 1832.

In the course of the 19th century, the &quot;Plateau&quot; was completely redeveloped with streets according to a grid plan, lined with grand colonial buildings and mansions. Praia officially became a city (&quot;cidade&quot;) in 1858, which secured its status as the capital of Cape Verde, concentrating political, religious and economic roles. In the early 1920s, the population was around 21,000.

As in other parts of the archipelago, resistance against Portuguese rule rose in the 1950s. There was no open independence war like in Guinea-Bissau; after the 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal and the resulting end of the Portuguese Colonial War, Cape Verde declared independence in July 1975. After independence, Praia underwent a demographic boom, receiving migrating movements from all the islands. As a result, 56% of the entire population of Cape Verde resides in Santiago; and 29% in the Municipality of Praia alone. Its estimated population has reached 151,436 (2015). On 28 June 1985, Praia became member of UCCLA, the Union of Luso – Afro-Americo-Asiatic Capital Cities, an international organization.

==Geography==

Geographically, Praia may be described as a set of plateaus and their surrounding valleys. These plateaus generally have the name &quot;achada&quot; (Achada de Santo António, Achada de São Filipe, Achada Eugénio Lima, Achada Grande, Achadinha, etc. — &quot;achada&quot; being a Portuguese word to designate a volcanic plateau), but the central one is called Plateau. The urban settlement is made mostly on top of these plateaus and along the valleys. The islet of Santa Maria is in front of the beach bearing the same name.

For a long time, only the &quot;Plateau&quot; was considered to be the city, the other neighbourhoods being relegated to the condition of peripheral suburbs, in spite of always having a close relationship with the &quot;Plateau&quot; (people movements, goods and services exchanges, etc.). This is why only the &quot;Plateau&quot; previously had relatively well-developed urbanization with its own infra-structures. The remaining neighbourhoods developed in a more organic, chaotic way.

Only after independence did the &quot;Plateau&quot; merge with the other neighbourhoods to constitute what is now considered the City of Praia. The whole city was, at the time, equipped with adequate infrastructure. Urbanization begun immediately after independence and sought to expand north.

===Climate===
Praia has a desert climate (Köppen: BWh) with a short wet season and a lengthy, very pronounced dry season. In fact, outside of the months of August, September and October, little precipitation falls on Praia. The city on average sees about of rain per year. Since the coldest month is far above its temperature patterns resembles a tropical climate, but lacks enough precipitation to be classified as such. Despite the fact that it has an arid climate, Praia seldom gets very hot or very cold, due to its oceanside location on Santiago Island. Temperatures are warm and constant with an average high temperature of and an average low temperature of .

==Demographics==

According to the national statistics office, the city&#x27;s population was estimated 159,050 as of July 2017. As of the mid-19th century, the population was estimated at 1,500 to 2,000.

When Edmund Roberts visited in 1832, he noted a population of black people in Praia totaling about &quot;nineteen twentieths&quot; of the population. 
==Education==
The city of Praia is home to the first primary school in the archipelago, originally known as the &quot;Escola Central&quot; (today known as the &quot;Escola Grande&quot;). For much time it was the only primary school in Praia. At the beginning of the 1960s, other primary schools began to be built in neighbourhoods around the Plateau and in other localities on the island.

Praia was also the first site in Cape Verde with a secondary education institution with the creation of the &quot;Liceu Nacional&quot; in 1861. However, the Portuguese authorities were not interested in implementing secondary education in Cape Verde and the school failed as a result; secondary education became, afterwards, the role of the &quot;Seminário de Ribeira Brava&quot; on the island of São Nicolau, and later of the lyceum in Mindelo.

In 1960, Praia again had secondary education, first with a facility on 12 September Plaza and later in its own building. With the expansion of education in Cape Verde in the 1990s, buildings dedicated to education were constructed in Cape Verde, and Praia in 2016 had 12 secondary education schools.

International schools:
* École Internationale Les Alizés (French school)
* Colégio Internacional – Cabo Verde (Portuguese school)

For higher education, there are the Universidade de Santiago, &quot;Instituto Superior de Ciencias Juridícas e Sociais&quot;, &quot;Instituto Superior de Ciencias Económicas e Empresariais&quot;, Jean Piaget University of Cape Verde, and University of Cape Verde.

Praia is also home to the National Library and the National Archives Building or the ANCV.

==Economy==

The principal economic activities of Praia belong to the tertiary sector. Beyond activities related to administration and governance (local and national), there are extensive commerce, services (health care, education, tourism, restaurants and hotels, public functions, etc.), and other activities of a liberal character.

Being the nation&#x27;s capital as well as the economic hub, Praia is one of the most economically viable cities in the Cape Verde archipelago. About one third (1/3) of the city&#x27;s population lives below the poverty line today (2014). The gross metropolitan product for the city is about 39% of the country&#x27;s GDP, translating into US$4764 income per capita.

==Transport ==

The city is served by Nelson Mandela International Airport and Cabo Verde Airlines, both having headquarters in Praia. It has the nation&#x27;s second most used port, Praia Harbor, with a ferry terminal linking to other islands, direct ferry routes are Maio, Fogo and São Vicente. The port is managed by the national port authority ENAPOR. The port was reconstructed and expanded in 2014.

Praia has a dual carriageway ring road, the &quot;Circular da Praia&quot; (EN1-ST06), which is connected with the main national roads to the north (EN1-ST01) and the west (EN1-ST05) of the island. The main roads inside the city are &quot;Avenida Grão Ducado de Luxemburgo&quot; (from the centre to the west), Avenida Amílcar Cabral (in &quot;Plateau&quot;) and Avenida Cidade de Lisboa.

===Public transport===
Public transport within the city of Praia is provided by the company SolAtlântico. There are 12 city bus lines. Intercity share taxis for other cities on the island of Santiago depart from the Sucupira terminal in the city centre, which was opened in May 2018. In 2015 a project called EcobusCV started running a fleet of dual fuel waste vegetable oil / diesel minibuses between Praia and Assomada. However, services were suspended in November 2016.

== Culture ==
There is the &quot;Museu Etnográfico&quot; (Ethnographic Museum), which was founded in 1997. Some of the oldest buildings in Praia are Jaime Mota Barracks (Quartel Jaime Mota) dating from 1826. Since 2016, the historic centre of Praia is on the tentative list of World Heritage Sites.

Landmarks in the colonial city center include Albuquerque Square (named after the colonial governor of the mid 19th century, Caetano Alexandre de Almeida e Albuquerque), the old city hall built in the 1920s, the Presidential Palace, which was constructed in the end of the 19th century to house the Portuguese governor and the &quot;Monumento de Diogo Gomes&quot;, named after the Portuguese navigator who discovered the island of Santiago in 1460.

<text>Programmed Inquiry, Learning, or Teaching (PILOT) is a simple high-level programming language developed in the 1960s. Like its younger sibling LOGO, it was developed as an early foray into the technology of computer-assisted instruction.

PILOT is an imperative language similar in structure to BASIC and FORTRAN in its basic layout and structure. Its keywords are single characters, codice_1 for &quot;type&quot; to print text, or codice_2 for &quot;accept&quot;, to input values from the user.

== History ==

Starting in 1960, John Amsden Starkweather a psychology professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) )medical center, developed a simple system for automating the construction of computer question-and-answer tests. Working with the Dixie Elementary School District in Marin County, by 1962 the system was functional on a IBM 1620 and given the name COMPUTEST.

UCSF installed a IBM System/360 Model 50, and Starkweather applied for a grant for further development by the U.S. Office of Education in 1965. Using this funding, Starkweather began development of an expanded version of the system with more functionality. He gave this version the new name PILOT. Early versions were shown in 1966, and the almost-complete version was released in 1968. The next year it was released into the public domain.

PILOT was later adopted by H. Dean Brown at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) Education Laboratory. Brown popularized PILOT as a language for use directly by children. Brown&#x27;s efforts changed the language from one intended for use by teachers to write tests and instructional materials to one intended to be used to teach programming.

PILOT was ported to a number of other systems, and various extensions and changes added at these sites. This led to a number of incompatible implementations with names like PYLON and NYLON. In 1973, Starkweather brought together a number of people interested in computer aided teaching to develop a machine-independent specification for the language, PILOT-73. A portable subset was also defined as Core PILOT. Core was then ported to the Datapoint 2200, an Intel 8008 powered terminal that would later be known as a personal computer. At $13,000, this was more expensive than many contemporary minicomputers and did not see much use. However, this port proved very useful after the Intel 8080 came to market and spawned many inexpensive microcomputers.

Starting in the late 1970s, Western Washington University began expanding the language into Common PILOT. This formed the basis for a number of later microcomputer variants. Processor Technology developed a version for their Sol-20, but the company went out of business before it was published. This nevertheless inspired several other versions during this era. Among these was Nevada PILOT for CP/M systems, based on Common, which in turn was the basis for Atari PILOT, which added a graphics system using turtle graphics and basic sound support. PILOT on the Apple II was written in UCSD Pascal. These versions led to a revival of the PILOT language for teaching, and led to an expanded version known as Super PILOT which added device control so programs could play videodisks and similar tasks.

For a time there was an effort to make a single standard for the language as IEEE Standard 1154-1991, but this was abandoned in 2000.

==Language syntax==

A line of PILOT code contains (from left to right) the following syntax elements:

* an optional label
* a command letter
* an optional Y (for yes) or N (for no)
* an optional conditional expression in parentheses
* a colon (&quot;:&quot;)
* an operand, or multiple operands delimited by commas.

A label can also be alone in a line, not followed by other code. The syntax for a label is an asterisk followed by an identifier (alphanumeric string with alphabetic initial character).

===Command letters===

The following commands are used in &quot;core PILOT&quot;. Lines beginning with &quot;R:&quot; indicate a remark (or a comment) explaining the code that follows.

; A: Accept input into &quot;accept buffer&quot;. Examples:

 R:Next line of input replaces current contents of accept buffer
 A:
 R:Next line of input replaces accept buffer, and string variable &#x27;FREE&#x27;
 A:$FREE
 R:Next 3 lines of input assigned to string variables &#x27;X&#x27;, &#x27;Y&#x27; and &#x27;Z&#x27;
 A:$X,$Y,$Z
 R:Numeric input assigned to numeric variable &quot;Q&quot;
 A:#Q

; C: Compute and assign numeric value. Most PILOT implementations have only integer arithmetic, and no arrays. Example:

 R:Assign arithmetic mean of #X and #Y to #AM
 C:#AM=(#X+#Y)/2

; D: Dimension an array, on some implementations.

; E: End (return from) subroutine or (if outside of a subroutine) abort program. Always used without any operand.

; J: Jump to a label. Example:
; M: Match the accept buffer against string variables or string literals. Example:
The first match string (if any) that is a substring of the accept buffer is assigned to the special variable $MATCH. The buffer characters left of the first match are assigned to $LEFT, and the characters on the right are assigned to $RIGHT.

The match flag is set to &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27;, depending on whether a match is made. Any statement that has a Y following the command letter is processed only if the match flag is set. Statements with N are processed only if the flag is not set.

; N: Equivalent to TN: (type if last match unsuccessful)

; R: The operand of R: is a comment, and therefore has no effect.

; T: &#x27;Type&#x27; operand as output. Examples:
; U: Use (call) a subroutine. A subroutine starts with a label and ends with E: Example:
; Y: Equivalent to TY: (type if last match successful)

; Parentheses: If there is a parenthesized expression in a statement, it is a conditional expression, and the statement is processed only if the test has a value of &#x27;true&#x27;. Example:
==Derivatives==
Extensions to core PILOT include arrays and floating point numbers in Apple PILOT for the Apple II, and LOGO-inspired turtle graphics in Atari PILOT for Atari 8-bit computers.

Between 1979 and 1983 the UK PILOT User Group was run by Alec Wood a teacher at Wirral Grammar School for Boys, Merseyside UK. Several machine code versions of a mini PILOT were produced for the microcomputers of the time and a school in Scotland developed an interactive foreign language tutorial where pupils guided footprints around a town asking and answering questions in German, French, etc. An article in the December 1979 of &quot;Computer Age&quot; covered an early implementation called Tiny Pilot and gave a complete machine code listing.

Versions of PILOT written using BASIC interpreters were released in the 1970s and early 1980s. The April 1973 edition of People&#x27;s Computer Company&#x27;s newsletter included such a system written in HP Time-Shared BASIC for the HP 2100 system. PETPILOT (PILOT for the Commodore PET) was the first non-Commodore language for the PET and was written in Microsoft BASIC which shipped with the PET, with a little assistance from Bill Gates. It was created in 1979 by Dave Gomberg and could run on a 4K PET (which was never shipped) and ran well on the 8K PETs that Commodore shipped. It was written in Larry Tessler&#x27;s living room on PET serial number 2. In 1978, Byte Magazine published a non-Turing complete derivative of PILOT known as Waduzitdo by Larry Kheriarty.

Atari PILOT, released in ROM cartridge form in 1981 for the Atari 8-bit computers, added turtle graphics and sound support. These instructions used two-letter commands. Atari used PILOT as one of their primary languages at the computer camps they ran in the early 1980s.

1983&#x27;s Vanilla PILOT for the Commodore 64 also added turtle graphics, as did &quot;Super Turtle PILOT&quot; which was published as a type-in listing in the October 1987 issue of COMPUTE! magazine.

In 1991 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) published a standard for Pilot as IEEE Std 1154-1991. It has since been withdrawn. A reference implementation based on this was implemented by Eric Raymond, and maintained—-reluctantly—-for the next 15 years.

In 1990 eSTeem PILOT for Atari ST computers was developed and programmed by Tom Nielsen, EdD. Based on the IEEE Standards for PILOT, it includes Atari-specific features such as control of Laserdisc and CDROM devices.

A 2018 hobbyist implementation, psPILOT, based in part on the IEEE standard, was implemented using Microsoft&#x27;s PowerShell scripting language.
