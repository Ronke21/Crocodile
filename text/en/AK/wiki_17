<text>Gwynedd () is a county in the north-west of Wales. It borders Anglesey across the Menai Strait to the north, Conwy, Denbighshire, and Powys to the east, Ceredigion over the Dyfi estuary to the south, and the Irish Sea to the west. The city of Bangor is the largest settlement, and the administrative centre is Caernarfon. The preserved county of Gwynedd, which is used for ceremonial purposes, includes the Isle of Anglesey.

Gwynedd is the second largest county in Wales but sparsely populated, with an area of and a population of 117,400. After Bangor (18,322), the largest settlements are Caernarfon (9,852), Bethesda (4,735), and Pwllheli (4,076). The county has the highest percentage of Welsh speakers in Wales, at 64.4%, and is considered a heartland of the language.

The geography of Gwynedd is mountainous, with a long coastline to the west. The county contains much of Snowdonia (), a national park which contains Wales&#x27;s highest mountain, Snowdon (; ). To the west, the Llŷn Peninsula is flatter and renowned for its scenic coastline, part of which is protected by the Llŷn AONB. Gwynedd also contains several of Wales&#x27;s largest lakes and reservoirs, including the largest, Bala Lake ().

The area which is now the county has played a prominent part in the history of Wales. It formed part of the core of the Kingdom of Gwynedd and the native Principality of Wales, which under the House of Aberffraw remained independent from the Kingdom of England until Edward I&#x27;s conquest between 1277 and 1283. Edward built the castles at Caernarfon and Harlech, which form part of the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd World Heritage Site. During the Industrial Revolution the slate industry rapidly developed; in the late nineteenth century the neighbouring Penrhyn and Dinorwic quarries were the largest in the world, and the Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales is now a World Heritage Site. Gwynedd covers the majority of the historic counties of Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire.

== Toponymy ==
In the past, historians such as J. E. Lloyd assumed that the Celtic source of the word &quot;Gwynedd&quot; meant &#x27;collection of tribes&#x27; – the same root as the Irish , meaning &#x27;tribe&#x27;. Further, a connection is recognised between the name and the Irish , an early ethnonym for the Irish themselves, related to , &#x27;company of hunting and fighting men, company of warriors under a leader&#x27;. Perhaps &quot;&quot; (&#x27;strive, hope, wish&#x27;) is the Indo-European stem. The Irish settled in NW Wales, and in Dyfed, at the end of the Roman era. was the Latin form, and in Penmachno there is a memorial stone from which reads: (&#x27;Here lies Cantiorix, citizen of Gwynedd&#x27;). The name was retained by the Brythons when the kingdom of Gwynedd was formed in the 5th century, and it remained until the invasion of Edward I. This historical name was revived when the new county was formed in 1974.

==History==


Gwynedd was an independent kingdom from the end of the Roman period until the 13th century, when it was conquered by England. The modern Gwynedd was one of eight Welsh counties created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the entirety of the historic counties of Anglesey and Caernarfonshire, and all of Merionethshire apart from Edeirnion Rural District (which went to Clwyd); and also a few parishes of Denbighshire: Llanrwst, Llansanffraid Glan Conwy, Eglwysbach, Llanddoged, Llanrwst and Tir Ifan.

The county was divided into five districts: Aberconwy, Arfon, Dwyfor, Meirionnydd and Anglesey.

The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 abolished the 1974 county (and the five districts) on 1 April 1996, and its area was divided: the Isle of Anglesey became an independent unitary authority, and Aberconwy (which included the former Denbighshire parishes) passed to the new Conwy County Borough. The remainder of the county was constituted as a principal area, with the name &quot;Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire&quot;, as it covers most of the areas of those two historic counties. As one of its first actions, the Council renamed itself &quot;Gwynedd&quot; on 2 April 1996. The present Gwynedd local government area is governed by Gwynedd Council. As a unitary authority, the modern entity no longer has any districts, but Arfon, Dwyfor and Meirionnydd remain as area committees.

The pre-1996 boundaries were retained as a preserved county for a few purposes such as the Lieutenancy. In 2003, the boundary with Clwyd was adjusted to match the modern local government boundary, so that the preserved county now covers the two local government areas of Gwynedd and Anglesey. Conwy county borough is now entirely within Clwyd.

A Gwynedd Constabulary was formed in 1950 by the merger of the Anglesey, Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire forces. A further amalgamation took place in the 1960s when Gwynedd Constabulary was merged with the Flintshire and Denbighshire county forces, retaining the name Gwynedd. In one proposal for local government reform in Wales, Gwynedd had been proposed as a name for a local authority covering all of north Wales, but the scheme as enacted divided this area between Gwynedd and Clwyd. To prevent confusion, the Gwynedd Constabulary was therefore renamed the North Wales Police.

The Snowdonia National Park was formed in 1951. After the 1974 local authority reorganisation, the park fell entirely within the boundaries of Gwynedd, and was run as a department of Gwynedd County Council. After the 1996 local government reorganisation, part of the park fell under Conwy County Borough, and the park&#x27;s administration separated from the Gwynedd council. Gwynedd Council still appoints nine of the eighteen members of the Snowdonia National Park Authority; Conwy County Borough Council appoints three; and the Welsh Government appoints the remaining six.

There has been considerable inwards migration to Gwynedd, particularly from England. According to the 2021 census, 66.6% of residents had been born in Wales whilst 27.1% were born in England.

==Economy==
The county has a mixed economy. An important part of the economy is based on tourism: many visitors are attracted by the many beaches and the mountains. A significant part of the county lies within the Snowdonia National Park, which extends from the north coast down to the district of Meirionnydd in the south. But tourism provides seasonal employment and thus there is a shortage of jobs in the winter.

Agriculture is less important than in the past, especially in terms of the number of people who earn their living on the land, but it remains an important element of the economy.

The most important of the traditional industries is the slate industry, but these days only a small percentage of workers earn their living in the slate quarries.

Industries which have developed more recently include TV and sound studios: the record company Sain has its HQ in the county.

The education sector is also very important for the local economy, including Bangor University and Further Education colleges, and , both now part of .

==Welsh speakers==
Gwynedd has the highest proportion of people in Wales who can speak Welsh. According to the 2021 census, 64.4% of the population aged three and over stated that they could speak Welsh, while 64.4% noted that they could speak Welsh in the 2011 census.

It is estimated that 83% of the county&#x27;s Welsh-speakers are fluent, the highest percentage of all counties in Wales. The age group with the highest proportion of Welsh speakers in Gwynedd were those between ages 5 and 15, of whom 92.3% stated that they could speak Welsh in 2011.

The proportion of Welsh speakers in Gwynedd declined between 1991 and 2001, from 72.1% to 68.7%, even though the proportion of Welsh speakers in Wales as a whole increased during that decade to 20.5%.

The Annual Population Survey estimated that as of March 2023, 77.0% of those in Gwynedd aged three years and above could speak Welsh.

<text>Mores (, sometimes ; , plural form of singular , meaning &quot;manner, custom, usage, or habit&quot;) are social norms that are widely observed within a particular society or culture. Mores determine what is considered morally acceptable or unacceptable within any given culture. A folkway is what is created through interaction and that process is what organizes interactions through routine, repetition, habit and consistency.

William Graham Sumner (1840–1910), an early U.S. sociologist, introduced both the terms &quot;mores&quot; (1898)
and &quot;folkways&quot; (1906) into modern sociology.

Mores are strict in the sense that they determine the difference between right and wrong in a given society, and people may be punished for their immorality which is common place in many societies in the world, at times with disapproval or ostracizing. Examples of traditional customs and conventions that are mores include lying, cheating, causing harm, alcohol use, drug use, marriage beliefs, gossip, slander, jealousy, disgracing or disrespecting parents, refusal to attend a funeral, politically incorrect humor, sports cheating, vandalism, leaving trash, plagiarism, bribery, corruption, saving face, respecting your elders, religious prescriptions and fiduciary responsibility.

Folkways are ways of thinking, acting and behaving in social groups which are agreed upon by the masses and are useful for the ordering of society. Folkways are spread through imitation, oral means or observation, and are meant to encompass the material, spiritual and verbal aspects of culture. Folkways meet the problems of social life; we feel security and order from their acceptance and application. Examples of folkways include: acceptable dress, manners, social etiquette, body language, posture, level of privacy, working hours and five day work week, acceptability of social drinking—abstaining or not from drinking during certain working hours, actions and behaviours in public places, school, university, business and religious institution, ceremonial situations, ritual, customary services and keeping personal space.

==Terminology==
The English word morality comes from the same Latin root &quot;mōrēs&quot;, as does the English noun &quot;moral&quot;. However, mores do not, as is commonly supposed, necessarily carry connotations of morality. Rather, morality can be seen as a subset of mores, held to be of central importance in view of their content, and often formalized into some kind of moral code or even into customary law. Etymological derivations include &quot;More danico&quot;, &quot;More judaico&quot;, &quot;More veneto&quot;, &quot;Coitus more ferarum&quot;, and &quot;O tempora, o mores!&quot;.

The Greek terms equivalent to Latin &quot;mores&quot; are &quot;ethos&quot; (ἔθος, ἦθος, &#x27;character&#x27;) or &quot;nomos&quot; (νόμος, &#x27;law&#x27;). As with the relation of &quot;mores&quot; to &quot;morality&quot;, &quot;ethos&quot; is the basis of the term &quot;ethics&quot;, while &quot;nomos&quot; gives the suffix &quot;-onomy&quot;, as in astronomy.

==Anthropology==

The meaning of all these terms extend to all customs of proper behavior in a given society, both religious and profane, from more trivial conventional aspects of custom, etiquette or politeness—&quot;folkways&quot; enforced by gentle social pressure, but going beyond mere &quot;folkways&quot; or conventions in including moral codes and notions of justice—down to strict taboos, behavior that is unthinkable within the society in question, very commonly including incest and murder, but also the commitment of outrages specific to the individual society such as blasphemy. Such religious or sacral customs may vary. Some examples include funerary services, matrimonial services; circumcision and covering of the hair in Judaism, Christian Ten Commandments, New Commandment and the sacraments or for example baptism, and Protestant work ethic, Shahada, prayer, alms, the fast and the pilgrimage as well as modesty in Islam, and religious diet.

While cultural universals are by definition part of the &quot;mores&quot; of every society (hence also called &quot;empty universals&quot;), the customary norms specific to a given society are a defining aspect of the cultural identity of an ethnicity or a nation. Coping with the differences between two sets of cultural conventions is a question of intercultural competence.

Differences in the &quot;mores&quot; of various nations are at the root of ethnic stereotype, or in the case of reflection upon one&#x27;s own &quot;mores&quot;, autostereotypes.

The customary norms in a given society may include indigenous land rights, honour, filial piety, customary law and the customary international law that affects countries who may not have codified their customary norms. Land rights of indigenous peoples is under customary land tenure, its a system of arrangement in-line with customs and norms. This is the case in colonies. An example of a norm is an culture of honor exists in some societies, where the family is viewed as the main source of honor and the conduct of family members reflects upon their family honor. For instance some writers say in Rome to have an honorable stance, to be equals with someone, existed for those who are most similar to one another (family and friends) this could be due to the competing for public recognition and therefore for personal and public honor, over rhetoric, sport, war, wealth and virtue. To protrude, stand out, be recognized and demonstrate this &quot;A Roman could win such a &quot;competition&quot; by pointing to past evidences of their honor&quot; and &quot;Or, a critic might be refuted by one&#x27;s performance in a fresh showdown in which one&#x27;s bona fides could be plainly demonstrated.&quot; Honor culture only can exist if the society has for males the shared code, a standard to uphold, guidelines and rules to follow, do not want to break those rules and how to interact successfully and to engage, this exists within a &quot;closed&quot; community of equals.

Filial piety is ethics towards one&#x27;s family, as Fung Yu-lan states &quot;the ideological basis for traditional [Chinese] society&quot; and according to Confucious repay a burden debt back to ones parents or caregiver but its also traditional in another sense so as to fulfill an obligation to ones own ancestors, also to modern scholars it suggests extends an attitude of respect to superiors also, who are deserving to have that respect.

<doc id="52517" wikidata="Q76543" url="?curid=52517" title="Ulrike Meinhof">
<text>Ulrike Marie Meinhof (7 October 1934 – 9 May 1976) was a German left-wing journalist and founding member of the Red Army Faction (RAF) in West Germany, commonly referred to in the press as the &quot;Baader-Meinhof gang&quot;. She is the reputed author of &quot;The Urban Guerilla Concept&quot; (1971). The manifesto acknowledges the RAF&#x27;s &quot;roots in the history of the student movement&quot;; condemns &quot;reformism&quot; as &quot;a brake on the anti-capitalist struggle&quot;; and invokes Mao Zedong to define &quot;armed struggle&quot; as &quot;the highest form of Marxism-Leninism&quot;.

Meinhof, who took part in the RAF&#x27;s May Offensive in 1972, was arrested in June of that year and spent the rest of her life in custody, largely isolated from outside contact. In November 1974, she was sentenced to 8 years in prison for an attempted murder that had taken place during the RAF&#x27;s successful jailbreak operation of Andreas Baader.

From 1975, she stood trial on multiple charges of murder and attempted murder, with the three other RAF leaders: Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe. Before the end of the trial, she was found hanged in her cell in the Stammheim Prison. The official finding of suicide sparked controversy. One year later, on , two members of the RAF assassinated the Federal Attorney-General Siegfried Buback as revenge.

==Early life==
Meinhof was born in 1934 in Oldenburg. Her father Werner Meinhof, a curator of Jena Museum, died of cancer in 1940, causing her mother to take in a boarder, Renate Riemeck, to make money. In 1946, the family moved back to Oldenburg after Jena fell under Soviet occupation as a result of the Yalta agreement. Meinhof&#x27;s mother, Ingeborg Meinhof, an art historian, began to work as a teacher and died from cancer in 1949. Riemeck took on the role of guardian of Meinhof and her elder sister, Wienke.

===Student activist 1950s===
In 1952, Meinhof took her &quot;Abitur&quot; at a school in Weilburg. She then studied philosophy, sociology, education and German at Marburg, where she became involved with reform movements. In 1957, she transferred to the University of Münster, where she met the Spanish Marxist intellectual Manuel Sacristán (who later translated and edited some of her writings), joined the &quot;Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund&quot; (SDS), the German Socialist Student Union. She participated in protests against the Bundeswehr and the proposal of Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s government to deploy nuclear weapons. Despite her involvement, Meinhof was critical of the SDS leaders&#x27; subconscious misogyny and the organisation&#x27;s marginalisation of female members. Meinhof eventually became the spokeswoman of the local &quot;Anti-Atomtod-Ausschuss&quot; (Anti Atomic-Death Committee). In 1958, she spent a short time on the AStA (German: &quot;Allgemeiner Studierendenausschuss&quot;, or General Committee of Students) of the university and wrote articles for various student newspapers.

===&quot;Konkret&quot; and protest in the 1960s ===
In 1959, Meinhof joined the banned Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and later began working at the magazine &quot;konkret&quot;, a monthly which, until 1964, had clandestine financing from the East German government. &quot;Konkret&quot; was widely read by student activists and progressive intellectuals, and as its chief editor from 1962 to 1964, Meinhof was able to elicit contributions from established journalists and authors.

On 2 June 1967, Meinhof&#x27;s exposure in &quot;konkret&quot; of German complicity in supporting the Pahlavi dynasty helped rally students to a demonstration in West Berlin against the visit of the Shah of Iran. When Iranian counter-demonstrators, including agents of the Shah&#x27;s intelligence service, attacked the students, the police joined the affray beating the demonstrators into a side street where an officer shot and killed the student protester Benno Ohnesorg The leading &quot;Stern&quot; columnist, Sebastian Haffner whom Meinhof had befriended, took to &quot;konkret&quot; to suggest &quot;with the [anti-] Student pogrom of 2 June 1967 fascism in West Berlin had thrown off its mask&quot;.

In February 1968, Meinhof was a participant in the International Vietnam Conference in West Berlin, which the authorities had permitted only in the face of large-scale protests. She was co-signatory, along with intellectuals including Ernst Bloch, Noam Chomsky, Eric Hobsbawn, Ernest Mandel, and Jean Paul Sartre, of the final declaration. This defined the U.S. intervention in Vietnam as &quot;the Spain of our generation&quot; and called for mobilisation against the &quot;extermination&quot; (&quot;Vernichtung&quot;) of the Vietnamese people.

===Marriage to Klaus Rainer Röhl===
In 1961, Meinhof married the co-founder and publisher of &quot;konkret&quot;, Klaus Rainer Röhl. Their marriage produced twins, Regine and Bettina, born on 21 September 1962. Meinhof and Röhl separated in 1967 and divorced a year later.

===Benign brain tumor surgically removed===
In 1962, Meinhof had a benign brain tumor surgically removed; the 1976 autopsy showed that remnants of the tumor and surgical scar tissue impinged on her amygdala.

==Establishment of the Red Army Faction==
The attempted assassination of SDS leader Rudi Dutschke on 11 April 1968 provoked Meinhof to write an article in &quot;konkret&quot; demonstrating her increasingly militant attitude and containing perhaps her best-known quote:
Later that year, her writings on arson attacks in Frankfurt as protests against the Vietnam War resulted in her developing an acquaintance with the perpetrators, most significantly Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin. She stopped writing for &quot;konkret&quot; which had in her opinion evolved into a completely commercial magazine in the early part of 1969, and many other authors followed her. She stated that neither she nor her collaborators wanted to give a left-wing alibi to the magazine that sooner or later &quot;would become part of the counter-revolution, a thing that I cannot gloss over with my co-operation, especially now that it is impossible to change its course&quot;. Later, they organised an occupation at &quot;konkret&quot;″s office (along with several members of the ), to distribute proclamations to the employees, something that failed since Röhl learned about it, and moved the employees to their homes to continue their work from there. Finally, Röhl&#x27;s house was vandalized by some of the protesters. Meinhof arrived in Röhl&#x27;s villa at 11:30, after police and journalists had already arrived. She was accused by Röhl (and subsequently described by the media) as the organizer of the vandalism. It was difficult to prove, as she was not there when it happened.

Perhaps her last work as an individual was the writing and production of the film &quot;&quot; in 1970, where she put focus on a group of West Berlin girls in juvenile detention; by the time it was scheduled to be aired, she was wanted for her part in the violent escape from police custody of Andreas Baader, and its broadcast was delayed until 1994.

==Release of Baader==
Meinhof had been approached to help in Baader&#x27;s escape by his girlfriend, Gudrun Ensslin. Meinhof persuaded the left-wing publisher Klaus Wagenbach to assist in the release of what he saw as a political prisoner. He issued her with a book contract, on the basis of which she petitioned authorities to allow Baader to travel from Moabit Prison for an interview at an institute for social research in the Dahlem district of Berlin. The plan was for armed comrades to enter the building, overpower the guards, and escape with Baader. No shooting was to take place, and Meinhof was to stay behind and deny any complicity in the action. 

Baader arrived with two guards and set to work with Meinhof in the institute&#x27;s library. Two women in Ensslin&#x27;s group, along with a man with a criminal record (hired because of his supposed experience with armed encounters) broke into the institute. The man shot the elderly librarian Georg Linke, severely wounding him in his liver. It was later claimed that the man was holding two weapons, a pistol and a gas canister gun, and accidentally fired the wrong weapon in the confusion. Following the unanticipated shooting, Meinhof joined the others in jumping out of the institute&#x27;s window. She then called a friend to pick up her children from school. Within days wanted posters appeared throughout Berlin offered a 10,000 DM reward for her capture for attempted murder.

==Action in the Red Army Faction and arrest==

In the next two years, Meinhof participated in the various bank robberies and bombings perpetrated by the group. She and other RAF members attempted to kidnap her children so that they could be sent to a camp for Palestinian orphans and educated there according to her desires; however, the twins were intercepted in Sicily and returned to their father, in part due to the intervention of Stefan Aust.

During this period, Meinhof wrote or recorded many of the manifestos and tracts for the RAF. The most significant of these is probably &quot;The Concept of the Urban Guerrilla&quot;, a response to an essay by Horst Mahler, that attempts to set out more correctly their prevailing ideology. It also included the first use of the name &quot;Rote Armee Fraktion&quot; and, in the publications of it, the first use of the RAF insignia. Her practical importance in the group, however, was often overstated by the media, the most obvious example being the common name &quot;Baader-Meinhof gang&quot; for the RAF. (Gudrun Ensslin is often considered to have been the effective female co-leader of the group rather than Meinhof.)

Meinhof wrote an essay defending the Munich massacre as part of a Palestinian strategy of resistance against Israeli land theft and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.

On 14 June 1972, in Langenhagen, Fritz Rodewald, a teacher who had been providing accommodation to deserters from the U.S. Armed Forces, was approached by a stranger asking for an overnighting house the next day for herself and a friend. He agreed but later became suspicious that the woman might be involved with the RAF and eventually decided to call the police. The next day the pair arrived at Rodewald&#x27;s dwelling while the police watched. The man was followed to a nearby telephone box and was found to be Gerhard Müller who was armed. After arresting Müller, the police then proceeded to arrest the woman – Meinhof.

==Imprisonment and death==
===&quot;Letter from a prisoner&quot; 1972–73===
During her solitary confinement at Köln-Ossendorf Prison from June 1972 to February 1973, Meinhof wrote what was later published as &quot;A Letter from a Prisoner in Isolation&quot; (&quot;Brief einer Gefangenen aus dem Toten Trakt&quot;). It conveys a sense of disorientation and despair:&lt;poem&gt;The feeling that one&#x27;s head is exploding…
The feeling that the brain is shriveling up like a baked fruit
The feeling that… one is being controlled remotely
The feeling that all one&#x27;s associations are being cut away
The feeling of pissing the soul out of one&#x27;s body, like someone who can no longer hold water.
…The raging aggressiveness for which there is no outlet. That&#x27;s the worst. The clear understanding that one has no chance of survival…&lt;/poem&gt;

===Response to 1972 Munich Massacre===
In December 1972, Meinhof, who was awaiting trial, was called to testify at Horst Mahler&#x27;s trial where Mahler questioned her about the statement of support the two had issued for the massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. The &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; published the following hostile account of her response:

“Unless we absolve the German people of fascism—that the people really didn’t know what was going on in the concentration camps—they can’t be mobilized for our struggle,” she said. After the war, the left, in dealing with fascism, were “negligent, stupid, and insolent.” They dealt with the people in the foreground, but didn’t look any deeper. “How was Auschwitz possible; what was antisemitism?” That is something that someone should have clarified at the time. Instead of collectively understanding Auschwitz as an expression of evil, Meinhof stated.

“The worst thing is that all of us, communists as well as others, were united in this.” However, she now recognizes that antisemitism can in its own way be anticapitalist. It separates the hatred of people about their dependency on money as a means of exchange from their desire for communism.

“Auschwitz meant that six million Jews were murdered and carted off to Europe’s garbage heap, dispensed with for what they were presented as: money Jews.” Finance capital and banks, “the hard core of the system” of imperialism and capitalism deflected the hate of the people for money and oppression from itself and transferred it to the Jews. Not having made this connection clear was the failure of the left and the communists.

Germans were antisemitic, therefore they are today RAF supporters. Only they don’t know it, because they’ve forgotten that they must be absolved of fascism and murdering Jews, and that antisemitism is in reality hatred of capitalism. In this regard Ulrike Meinhof ably constructed a remarkable statement about the failure of the Baader-Meinhof Group. With it, it is also possible to praise the Black September attack in Munich. She claimed to feel an “historical identity” with the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto, who attempted an unarmed uprising leading to their defeat. “We have broken through the entire blah blah. We have provided the left with obvious encouragement, which they have voluntarily allowed to dissipate, because we’ve all been arrested.”

===Sentencing===
After two years of preliminary hearings, Meinhof was sentenced to eight years imprisonment on 29 November 1974. Eventually, Meinhof, Baader, Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe were jointly charged on 19 August 1975, with four counts of murder, fifty-four of attempted murder, and a single count of forming a criminal association. Before the trial was concluded, Meinhof was found hanged by a rope, fashioned from a towel, in her cell in the Stammheim Prison, Stuttgart, on 9 May 1976. It is highly probable that, if not for her death, she would have been sentenced to life imprisonment plus 15 years. (The remaining three defendants received such a sentence, designed to minimize the possibility of early parole.)

===Death===
On 9 May 1976, Meinhof was found dead in her prison cell in Stuttgart-Stammheim. The official verdict was Meinhof had committed suicide. It was later claimed that she had become increasingly isolated from other RAF prisoners. Notes exchanged between them in prison included one by Ensslin, describing her as &quot;too weak&quot;. The official findings were not accepted by many in the RAF and other militant organisations, and there are still some who doubt their accuracy and believe that she was murdered by the authorities. A second investigation was carried out by an international group. The findings of the inquiry were published under the title &quot;Der Tod Ulrike Meinhofs. Bericht der Internationalen Untersuchungskommission&quot; (&quot;The Death of Ulrike Meinhof. Report of the International Investigation Committee&quot;) in 1979.

Meinhof was buried in Berlin-Mariendorf, six days after her death. Her funeral turned out to be a demonstration of about 7,000 people. Demonstrations took place across the country, and social and political prisoners in Berlin and Hessen held a three-day hunger strike. Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in an open letter compared her death to the worst crimes of the Nazi era.

In late 2002, following investigations by her daughter Bettina, it was discovered that Meinhof&#x27;s brain had been retained (apparently without permission) following the autopsy performed as part of the investigation into her death. The original autopsy had found brain injury near the amygdala, resulting from successful surgery in 1962 to remove a (benign) cyst. The unpublished autopsy results at the time stated that the brain injuries &quot;justified questions as to the culpability&quot; of Meinhof. Bernhard Bogerts, a psychiatrist at Magdeburg University, later re-examined the brain and also doubted that Meinhof was fully criminally responsible. On Bettina&#x27;s request, the brain was interred in Meinhof&#x27;s burial place on 19 December 2002.

==Controversy surrounding her death==
=== Last days in prison ===
Meinhof&#x27;s last appearance in court was on 4 May 1976, in a hearing the defendants had requested in order to provide evidence about the participation of West Germany in the Vietnam War. This, they claimed, was the cause of their radicalisation, and was their basis for demanding the status of prisoners of war (see above). According to Jutta Ditfurth, the last days before Meinhof&#x27;s death went smoothly. The prisoners (including Meinhof) spent their meeting time (30 minutes, twice per day) discussing various philosophers and political issues. One of the guards noted that they were laughing.

According to Meinhof&#x27;s sister, Wienke Zitzlaff, during her last visit to the prison, Meinhof had told her: &quot;You can stand up and fight only while you are alive. If they say I committed suicide, be sure that it was a murder.&quot;

In early May, attorney Axel Azzola contacted his client (Meinhof). They were hopeful about the possibilities that the new strategy seemed to offer. They also discussed whether Meinhof could testify as a witness at the International Law Conference in Geneva where a delegation of lawyers planned to denounce the measure of detention in solitary confinement. Finally, Meinhof was planning to reveal main witness Gerhard Müller&#x27;s role in the trial. Federal prosecutors had indicted the four defendants for the murder of a policeman Norbert Schmid, who was shot by Müller himself.

During the press conference called by defense attorneys, one of Meinhof&#x27;s lawyers, Michael Oberwinder, stated that it was less than a week before Meinhof&#x27;s death that they had a very involved conversation. He claimed that there was not the least sign of depression or lack of interest on her part and that it was an animated discussion in the context of which Meinhof explained the group&#x27;s point of view.

Meinhof&#x27;s last visitor was Giovanni Capelli, lawyer of the Red Brigades. He conveyed the desire of the Red Brigades to contact her and described the conditions of detention in Italy where prisoners were not held in isolation (except Renato Curcio) and were politically active. They also discussed the establishment of an international committee of lawyers to defend the RAF. Capelli later said that Meinhof gave him the impression of &quot;a vivid, lifelike woman&quot;, &quot;open to all questions&quot;. They arranged to meet again soon. &quot;She behaved like a woman who wanted to live&quot;.

=== Autopsy and investigation ===
At 9.20 a.m. on 9 May, the Ministry of Justice of Baden-Württemberg announced that Meinhof had committed suicide, although the initial post-mortem body examination by Professor Joachim Rauschke did not begin until at least 9:25 a.m. At 9:34 a.m. the German news agency (dpa) announced &quot;Suicide by hanging&quot;.. Two hours later Professor Rauschke together with Hans Joachim Mallach performed the official autopsy in the general hospital of Stuttgart from 11:45 a.m. until 12:45 p.m., whose outcome was &quot;death by hanging beyond doubt&quot;. According to Ditfurth the hasty press releases that followed Meinhof&#x27;s death, were similar to those of April 1972, when it was incorrectly broadcast that Meinhof had committed suicide.. In the following days, the newspapers reported in detail what were supposed to be Meinhof&#x27;s thoughts, like: &quot;she realised her mistake,&quot; &quot;she had become aware of the futility,&quot; and that she &quot;resigned to death&quot;.

There was a concern among Meinhof supporters about the forensic surgeons chosen by the state to perform the autopsy. Mallach (NSDAP Member No. 9154986) had been a member of the SS. He served in World War II as corporal in a Panzer division. In 1977, he made (without approval) and kept for a long time the death masks of Baader, Ensslin, and Raspe. Rauschke was the one who also performed the autopsy of Siegfried Hausner one year earlier and was accused by fellows and supporters of the RAF for ignoring the injuries to Hausner&#x27;s head, so as to cover up the true cause of his death.

On 11 May a second autopsy was performed on demand of Wienke Zitzlaff by Werner Janssen and Jürgen Schröder, even though the brain, a lot of critical organs, and tissue parts had been previously removed from the body. Also, her nails had been cut, so the doctors could not determine clearly if there were traces of struggle. Some examinations could not take place since a critical time had passed. Janssen concluded that the most probable cause of death was &quot;suicide by hanging&quot;, however in order to come to a definite conclusion he insisted to be given access to the report of the first autopsy, something that never happened.

Finally, on demand of Meinhof&#x27;s attorney Klaus Croissant and the International Committee for Political Prisoners, an international investigation commission was created in order to examine the conditions surrounding Meinhof&#x27;s death. Once more the German authorities refused to give the complete (first) autopsy report to the commission, hindering their investigation. In 1978 the committee published its report, concluding that: &quot;The formal claim that Ulrike Meinhof committed suicide by hanging is unfounded, given the fact that the investigation results reasonably converge to the conclusion that she could not hang herself. Most probably Ulrike Meinhof was already dead before she was hanged and there are warning signs indicating the involvement of a third party regarding her death.&quot;

=== Suicide disputation ===
The circumstances around Meinhof&#x27;s death have been disputed by people close to her, including many of Meinhof&#x27;s relatives, friends, lawyers, and comrades, presenting various arguments. There are inquiries regarding the procedure followed by the authorities, including the autopsy reports and the findings of the international commission. Some of them are:

*Some exams like the histamine test were omitted, something that could determine if Meinhof was alive the moment she was hanged
*Meinhof&#x27;s body and head lacked some common signs of suicide by hanging.
*Both autopsy reports mention severe swelling in external genitals as well as abrasions on the left buttock. Jansen-Schroder&#x27;s report also mentioned contusions in the right hip area and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
*Although the prison report mentions that the chair used by Meinhof to hang herself had fallen, photographs published by the police show that her left leg rests on that (standing) chair that is upon the soft mattress.

Some other questions still remain, including:
*Why there were no fingerprints of Meinhof on the light bulb she had? What about the contradictory statements regarding the internal organs of the neck, and the noose length?
*Why were no fabric traces from the towel found either on the knife or the scissors Meinhof had?
*Two days after Meinhof&#x27;s death, the prison staff cleaned and painted her cell despite the fact that it had been repainted in September 1975 (8 months before). Shouldn&#x27;t the cell be sealed? Why had police seized all of Meinhof&#x27;s personal items and refused to give them to her relatives or lawyers? Other prisoners reported that handwritten documents, which Meinhof used to keep with her inside a black dossier, had also disappeared. Her fellow prisoners insisted that her cell remained intact until Meinhof&#x27;s lawyers arrived, but &quot;by the time the first lawyer arrived the metal tank had already been extracted hastily&quot; (Ensslin). They were prohibited to come closer to the corridor in order to have visual contact with the cell. The authorities also prohibited Wienke Zitzlaff, Anja Röhl, Klaus Croissant, and Michael Oberwinder to view Meinhof&#x27;s body and the inside of the cell. According to the official explanation they were also looking for incriminating documents that could be used against Klaus Croissant.

Finally, there is a dispute over the arguments regarding Meinhof&#x27;s motive. Some of the points usually mentioned are:
*That no suicide note was found (even though, according to Ensslin, Meinhof was working on a typewriter the last night – as she used to do in the last months), has been considered suspicious. Why would Meinhof allow the government and media to talk about &quot;rejection&quot;, and &quot;awareness of her political mistake&quot;, at the moment that, according to her lawyers, her main concern was to ensure the integrity of organisation&#x27;s political identity both to the trial and beyond?
*The official claim was that there was tension among the defendants and especially between Meinhof and Ensslin. On 9 May the Federal Prosecutor Felix Kaul spoke about &quot;deep contradistinctions&quot; and &quot;profound clashes&quot; among the team, claiming Meinhof had realized that Baader was &quot;a common criminal&quot;, and finally tried to prove the conflict between Meinhof and Ensslin by mentioning a series of letters between them. However these letters were dated no later than early March when they informed the other prisoners (through the &quot;info&quot; network) that their conflict was over, mentioning that: &quot;We didn&#x27;t even realise what they were doing to ourselves&quot; (Meinhof), the cause of their conflict &quot;finally seemed strange&quot; when they &quot;understood what was happening&quot; to them (Ensslin).
*When a &quot;Stern&quot; representative asked Traugott Bender (Minister of Justice of Baden-Württemberg): &quot;Since the federal prosecutors of Karlsruhe were (somehow) aware of the tension within the group, why wasn&#x27;t this noticed by the prison staff?&quot; he answered: &quot;If there were conflicts they were older and had never led to something like this&quot;. When he was asked if Meinhof had been isolated by the rest of the prisoners, he answered, &quot;I am not aware of that fact.&quot; Jailer Renate Frede and prison official Horst Bubeck reported that they had not noticed any strange or unusual behaviour, or conflicts among the prisoners.

==Portrayals==
The book &quot;&quot; (Better angry than sad) by Alois Prinz was intended as a mainly faithful account of Meinhof&#x27;s life story for adolescents.

Meinhof&#x27;s life has been the subject, to varying degrees of fictionalisation, of several films and stage productions. Treatment in films include Reinhard Hauff&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Stammheim&quot;, an account of the Stammheim trial, Margarethe von Trotta&#x27;s 1981 &quot;Marianne and Juliane&quot; and Uli Edel&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;The Baader Meinhof Complex&quot;. Stage treatments include the 1990 opera &quot;Ulrike Meinhof&quot; by Johann Kresnik, the 1993 play &quot;Leviathan&quot; by Dea Loher, the 2005 play &quot;La extraordinaria muerte de Ulrike M.&quot; by Spanish playwright Carlos Be and the 2006 play &quot;&quot; by Austrian playwright Elfriede Jelinek. The 1981 French movie &quot;Birgitt Haas Must Be Killed&quot; is inspired by Meinhof&#x27;s death.

In 1978, Dario Fo and Franca Rame wrote the monologue &quot;Moi, Ulrike, je crie...&quot; 

The 2010 feature documentary &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; tells Meinhof&#x27;s story from the perspective of her daughter, journalist and historian Bettina Röhl.

&quot;Subtopia&quot;, a novel published in 2005 by Australian author and academic A.L. McCann, is partially set in Berlin and contains a character who is obsessed with Meinhof and another who claims to have attended her funeral.

The 2013 book &quot;Revolutionary Brain&quot; by Harold Jaffe features a titular section devoted to the brain of Meinhof.

The 2018 film &quot;7 Days in Entebbe&quot; about Operation Entebbe mentions Meinhof as motivation for the participation of the Germans in the hijacking, particularly Brigitte Kuhlmann. The film suggests Meinhof was a friend of Kuhlmann and Böse and that a mistake Kuhlmann made resulted in her imprisonment and subsequent death.

===Music===
In 1975, the Italian singer-songwriter Claudio Lolli published the song Incubo Numero Zero (Nightmare #0), with the verse &quot;turn off the light, thought Ulrike&quot;, and more.

Marianne Faithfull&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Broken English&quot; had the title track dedicated to Meinhof.

The anarcho punk band Chumbawamba&#x27;s 1990 album, &quot;Slap!&quot; featured an opening and closing track, both named after Meinhof. The first track was entitled &quot;Ulrike&quot; and featured lyrics that directly involve Meinhof as the protagonist and the final track was an instrumental reprise of the first track. and was entitled &quot;Meinhof&quot;. The album&#x27;s liner notes included information and an article relating to the song Ulrike.

Electronica act Doris Days created a track entitled &quot;To Ulrike M.&quot;, in which there is a passage spoken in German throughout the song, presumably an archived audio file from Meinhof herself. This track has since been remixed by other electronica acts like Zero 7, Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister, and The Amalgamation of Soundz.

The German duo Andreas Ammer and F.M. Einheit released an album in 1996 entitled &quot;Deutsche Krieger&quot;, a substantial portion of which consists of audio recordings of and about Meinhof.

Der Plan, the electronic music group from Düsseldorf published 2004 the song &quot;Ulrike&quot;, as part of the Die Verschwörung album.

London-based experimental group Cindytalk has an electronic side-project called Bambule, named after the Meinhof film of the same name.

German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein feature Meinhof, played by lead singer Till Lindemann, in the music video to their 2019 song Deutschland.

The English alternative rock band Ulrika Spacek took their name from Meinhof and American performer Sissy Spacek.

<text>The Vale of Glamorgan ( ), locally referred to as &quot;The Vale&quot;, is a county borough in the south-east of Wales. It borders Bridgend County Borough to the west, Cardiff to the east, Rhondda Cynon Taf to the north, and the Bristol Channel to the south. With an economy based largely on agriculture and chemicals, it is the southernmost unitary authority in Wales. Attractions include Barry Island Pleasure Park, the Barry Tourist Railway, Medieval wall paintings in St Cadoc&#x27;s Church, Llancarfan, Porthkerry Park, St Donat&#x27;s Castle, Cosmeston Lakes Country Park and Cosmeston Medieval Village. The largest town is Barry. Other towns include Penarth, Llantwit Major, and Cowbridge. There are many villages in the county borough.

==History==
The area is the southernmost part of the county of Glamorgan. Between the 11th century and 1536 the area was part of the Lordship of Glamorgan.

In medieval times, the village of Cosmeston, near what is today Penarth in the south east of the county, grew up around a fortified manor house constructed sometime around the 12th century by the De Costentin family. The De Costentins, who originated on the Cotentin peninsula in northern France, were among the first Norman invaders of Wales in the early 12th century following William the Conqueror&#x27;s invasion of neighbouring England in 1066. The village would have consisted of a number of small stone round houses, or crofts, with thatched roofs.

Clemenstone, to the west, was the seat of several high sheriffs of Glamorganshire, including John Curre who was known to have occupied the estate in 1712. William Curre, known to have lived in Clemenstone in 1766, was also an occupant of Itton Court in Monmouthshire. In the early 19th century, Lady Sale née Wynch, wife of Sir Robert Sale, spent much of her early life on the Clemenstone Estate.

In 1974, the Vale of Glamorgan Borough was created, with a population of 103,000. The Vale of Glamorgan was a second tier district, part of the new county of South Glamorgan, under the Local Government Act 1972. It created several problems in local governance, between the South Glamorgan County Council, Cardiff City Council and the Vale of Glamorgan Borough Council owing to their conflicting interests. It was a turbulent time for governance in the city of Cardiff, as for the first time in its history it had to share authority with the county council, which was larger and better resourced. In April 1996, the Vale of Glamorgan became a county borough (unitary authority) of Wales.

==Geography==
Located immediately to the west of Cardiff between the M4 motorway and the Severn Estuary, the county borough of Vale of Glamorgan covers 33,097 hectares (130 square miles) and has of coastline. The physiographical district from which the modern administrative area derives its name is the slightly larger, generally low-lying area which extends from the River Kenfig in the west, eastwards as far as the Rhymney. The Pennant Sandstone scarp forms its northern boundary.
The largest centre of population in the borough is Barry (51,502 inhabitants). Other towns include Cowbridge (6,180), Dinas Powys (7,799), Llantwit Major (10,621) and Penarth (22,083). Much of the population inhabits villages, hamlets and individual farms. The area is low-lying, with a maximum height of above sea level at Tair Onen to the east of Cowbridge.

The borough borders Cardiff to the north east, Rhondda Cynon Taf to the north, Bridgend to the north west and the Bristol Channel to the south.

The yellow-grey cliffs on the Glamorgan Heritage Coast (which stretches between Gileston and Ogmore-by-Sea) are unique on the Celtic Sea coastline (i.e. Cornwall, Wales, Ireland and Brittany) as they are formed of a combination of Liassic limestone, shale and Carboniferous Limestone. The rocks were formed between 360 and 200 million years ago when the whole area lay underneath a warm, shallow sea at the start of the Jurassic period. Thus today the cliffs contain traces of Jurassic sea creatures, such as ammonites. The calcium carbonate (limestone) in the soil allows crops to be grown which would be difficult elsewhere in Wales. The Liassic limestone and Carboniferous Limestone are also used in the Vale as building materials; in previous centuries it was taken by sloops across the Bristol Channel to North Cornish ports such as Bude, Boscastle and Port Isaac to fertilise Cornwall&#x27;s poor slate soils; the hard Devonian slate was brought back from Cornwall as a roofing material for houses in the Vale.

As the Glamorgan Heritage Coast faces westwards out to the Atlantic, it bears the brunt of onshore (westerly and south-westerly) winds: ideal for surfing, but a nuisance for ships sailing up the Bristol Channel to Cardiff. As in North Cornwall and South-West Ireland, the fierce Atlantic gales created ideal conditions for deliberate shipwrecking, which until 100 years ago was very common along the coast. Nash Point, Southerndown and Ogmore-by-Sea have some of the highest shipwreck victims on the coast of Wales; as recently as 1962 an oil tanker, the BP Driver, crashed into Nash Point during a violent westerly storm, was torn to shreds by the reefs and eventually sank, although the crew were saved by various Bristol Channel lifeboats and helicopters.

==Economy==
The Vale of Glamorgan was determined to be the wealthiest area in Wales in a 2003 survey conducted by Barclays Bank that measured disposable income. Chemical industries are located to the east of the port of Barry while further inland the main activity is agriculture, especially beef and dairy cattle, with marketing facilities at Cowbridge.

==Government==
The Vale of Glamorgan UK parliament and Senedd constituencies (which do not include Penarth and Sully which are in the constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth) sway between Labour control and Conservative Party control in both the Senedd and Westminster. The UK parliament constituency was created in 1983 and the Welsh Assembly (later Senedd) constituency in 1999. There is substantial Labour support in the east of the constituency and in the town of Barry, and substantial Conservative support in the agricultural area in the west.

Since 1996 local government is led by Vale of Glamorgan Council. The Labour Party had a large majority initially, though between 1999 and 2012 the Conservatives were the largest group. Since 2017, there has been no overall political majority on council.

===Communities===
All except one (Rhoose) of the Vale&#x27;s communities elects a community (or town) council, the lowest tier of local government.

==Sport==

The principal football club in the Vale is Barry Town United F.C., of the Cymru Premier who play their home games at Jenner Park Stadium in Barry. The club was founded in 1912 and enjoyed success in the 1990s, when they won the League of Wales and the Welsh Cup. The club experienced declining fortunes in the following decade and were relegated to Welsh Football League Division Two, but were promoted to Division One after winning the league in the 2014–15 season. In 2014 it was announced that Jenner Park stadium would undergo a £350,000 plus development with the laying of a synthetic pitch. There are several other smaller football clubs in the county such as Llantwit Major F.C., established in 1962, which competes in the Cymru South, and Penarth Town AFC in the Vale of Glamorgan League.

Rugby has a strong presence in the county, though none of its clubs compete in the higher leagues. As of the 2015–6 season, Penarth RFC competes in the WRU Division Three South East, Llantwit Major RFC in WRU Division Four South East, and Old Penarthians RFC and Cowbridge RFC in the WRU Division Five South East. Several of the clubs are feeders for Cardiff Blues.
There are cricket grounds in Cowbridge and Sully and several golf clubs, including the Glamorganshire, Southerndown and Wenvoe Castle clubs.

==Transport==
===Road===
Owing to its close proximity to Cardiff, most of the major roads in the county borough originate in the capital.

Running east–west, the A48 runs through the centre portion of the Vale of Glamorgan between Cardiff and Bridgend, passing along the northern edge of Cowbridge. The M4 motorway also runs east–west along the northern edge of the Vale, linking the area to major cities such as London, Bristol, Newport, and Swansea. Junctions 33 (Cardiff West) and 34 (Llantrisant) provide direct access to the Vale of Glamorgan.

The M4 is economically important to the county borough as it &quot;facilitates the movements of goods and people&quot; from the region to other areas of the UK, enabling local firms &quot;access to domestic and international markets.&quot; The county borough benefits from its location in the M4 technology corridor, according to the Welsh Government.

===Rail===
The Vale of Glamorgan Line is the county borough&#x27;s principal rail connection. The line runs between Cardiff Central and Bridgend, with spurs to Barry Island and Penarth. All services on the line are operated by Transport for Wales, linking the Vale directly to other areas of the capital region, including Cardiff Queen Street, Pontypridd, and Merthyr Tydfil. Railway stations in the Vale of Glamorgan are:

The South Wales Main Line passes through the Vale, but trains do not stop. The nearest stations on the South Wales Main Line are (from east to west): Cardiff Central; Pontyclun; Llanharan; Pencoed; Bridgend. Most services are operated by Transport for Wales, but Bridgend and Cardiff are additionally served by Great Western Railway services between Swansea and London Paddington. Cardiff Central is further served by Great Western Railway services to destinations in South West England and CrossCountry services to the Midlands.

The Barry Tourist Railway is a short heritage railway and museum on Barry Island.

===Bus===
Bus services in the Vale of Glamorgan are principally operated by New Adventure Travel (NAT) and Cardiff Bus. 
The Vale of Glamorgan Council operates a community &#x27;on-demand&#x27; transport service in rural communities called Greenlinks.

===Air===
Cardiff Airport is in the Vale of Glamorgan, near Rhoose.

In 2019, Cardiff Airport claimed to have a £135 million direct economic benefit to the region. Destinations from Cardiff Airport at the time included Alicante, Amsterdam, Anglesey, Dublin, and Doha. A &quot;Masterplan&quot; for the airport sets out the Welsh Government&#x27;s ambition to grow the airport&#x27;s passenger numbers and freight operations by 2040.

<text>Glamorgan (), or sometimes Glamorganshire ( or ), was one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales in the south of Wales. Originally an early medieval petty kingdom of varying boundaries known in Welsh as Morgannwg (or Glywysing), which was then invaded and taken over by the Normans as the Lordship of Glamorgan. The area that became known as Glamorgan was both a rural, pastoral area, and a conflict point between the Norman lords and the Welsh princes. It was defined by a large concentration of castles.

After falling under English rule in the 16th century, Glamorgan became a more stable county, and exploited its natural resources to become an important part of the Industrial Revolution. Glamorgan was the most populous and industrialised county in Wales, and was once called the &quot;crucible of the Industrial Revolution&quot;, as it contained the world centres of three metallurgical industries (iron, steel and copper) and its rich resources of coal.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, the county boroughs and administrative county of Glamorgan were abolished on 1 April 1974, with three new counties being established, each containing a former county borough: West Glamorgan, Mid Glamorgan, South Glamorgan. The name also survives in that of Vale of Glamorgan, a county borough.

Glamorgan comprised distinct regions: the industrial valleys, the agricultural vale and the scenic Gower Peninsula. The county had boundaries with Brecknockshire (north), Monmouthshire (east), Carmarthenshire (west), and to the south it was bordered by the Bristol Channel. The total area was . Glamorgan contained two cities, Cardiff, the county town and from 1955 the capital city of Wales, and Swansea. The highest point in the county was Craig y Llyn () near the village of Rhigos in the Cynon Valley.

==History==
===Origins===

Glamorgan&#x27;s terrain has been inhabited by humankind for over 200,000 years. Climate fluctuation caused the formation, disappearance, and reformation of glaciers which, in turn, caused sea levels to rise and fall. At various times life has flourished, at others the area is likely to have been completely uninhabitable. Evidence of the presence of Neanderthals has been discovered on the Gower Peninsula. Whether they remained in the area during periods of extreme cold is unclear. Sea levels have been lower and higher than at present, resulting in significant changes to the coastline during this period.

Archaeological evidence shows that humans settled in the area during an interstadial period. The oldest known human burial in Great Britain – the &quot;Red Lady of Paviland&quot; – was discovered in a coastal cave between Port Eynon and Rhossili, on the Gower Peninsula. The &#x27;lady&#x27; has been radiocarbon dated to c. 29,000 years before present (BP) – during the Late Pleistocene – at which time the cave overlooked an area of plain, some miles from the sea.

From the end of the last ice age (between 12,000 and 10,000 BP) Mesolithic hunter-gatherers began to migrate to the British Peninsula – through Doggerland – from the European mainland. Archaeologist Stephen Aldhouse-Green notes that while Wales has a &quot;multitude&quot; of Mesolithic sites, their settlements were &quot;focused on the coastal plains&quot;, the uplands were &quot;exploited only by specialist hunting groups&quot;.
Human lifestyles in North-West Europe changed around 6000 BP; from the Mesolithic nomadic lives of hunting and gathering, to the Neolithic agrarian life of agriculture and settlement. They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land and developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production. A tradition of long barrow construction began in continental Europe during the 7th millennium BP – the free standing megalithic structures supporting a sloping capstone (known as &quot;dolmens)&quot;; common over Atlantic Europe. Nineteen Neolithic chambered tombs (or &quot;long barrows&quot;) and five possible henges have been identified in Glamorgan. These megalithic burial chambers, or &quot;cromlechi&quot;, were built between 6000 and 5000 BP, during the early Neolithic period, the first of them about 1500 years before either Stonehenge or the Egyptian Great Pyramid of Giza was completed. Two major groups of Neolithic architectural traditions are represented in the area: portal dolmens (e.g. St Lythans burial chamber (Vale of Glamorgan), and Cae&#x27;rarfau (near Creigiau)); and Severn-Cotswold chamber tombs (e.g. &quot;Parc Cwm&quot; long cairn, (&quot;Parc le Breos Cwm&quot;, Gower Peninsula), and Tinkinswood burial chamber (Vale of Glamorgan)), as well as tombs that do not fall easily into either group. Such massive constructions would have needed a large labour force – up to 200 men – suggestive of large communities nearby. Archaeological evidence from some Neolithic sites (e.g. Tinkinswood) has shown the continued use of cromlechi in the Bronze Age.

The Bronze Age – defined by the use of metal – has made a lasting impression on the area. Over six hundred Bronze Age barrows and cairns, of various types, have been identified all over Glamorgan. Other technological innovations – including the wheel; harnessing oxen; weaving textiles; brewing alcohol; and skillful metalworking (producing new weapons and tools, and fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as brooches and torcs) – changed people&#x27;s everyday lives during this period. Deforestation continued to the more remote areas as a warmer climate allowed the cultivation even of upland areas.
By 4000 BP people had begun to bury, or cremate their dead in individual cists, beneath a mound of earth known as a round barrow; sometimes with a distinctive style of finely decorated pottery – like those at Llanharry (discovered 1929) and at Llandaff (1991) – that gave rise to the Early Bronze Age being described as &quot;Beaker culture&quot;. From c. 3350 BP, a worsening climate began to make agriculture unsustainable in upland areas. The resulting population pressures appear to have led to conflict. Hill forts began to be built from the Late Bronze Age (and throughout the Iron Age (3150–1900 BP)) and the amount and quality of weapons increased noticeably – along the regionally distinctive tribal lines of the Iron Age.

Archaeological evidence from two sites in Glamorgan shows Bronze Age practices and settlements continued into the Iron Age. Finds from &quot;Llyn Fawr&quot;, thought to be votive offerings, include weapons and tools from the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age. The hoard, described as &quot;one of the most significant prehistoric metalwork hoards in Wales&quot; has given its name to the Llyn Fawr Phase, the last Bronze Age phase in Britain. Excavations at Llanmaes, Vale of Glamorgan, indicate a settlement and &quot;feasting site&quot; occupied from the Late Bronze Age until the Roman occupation. Until the Roman conquest of Britain, the area that would become known as Glamorgan was part of the territory of the Silures – a Celtic British tribe that flourished in the Iron Age – whose territory also included the areas that would become known as Breconshire and Monmouthshire. The Silures had hill forts throughout the area – e.g., Caerau (Cardiff), Caerau hill fort, Rhiwsaeson (Llantrisant), and Y Bwlwarcau [Mynydd Margam], south west of Maesteg – and cliff castles along the Glamorgan coast – e.g., Burry Holms (Gower Peninsula). Excavations at one – Dunraven hill fort (Southerndown, Vale of Glamorgan) – revealed the remains of twenty-one roundhouses.

Many other settlements of the Silures were neither hill forts nor castles. For example, the fort established by the Romans near the estuary of the River Taff in 75 AD, in what would become Cardiff, was built over an extensive settlement established by the Silures in the 50s AD.

===Morgannwg===

====Early history====
The region originated as an independent petty kingdom named &quot;Glywysing&quot;, believed to be named after a 5th-century Welsh king called Glywys, who is said to have been descended from a Roman Governor in the region. Saint Paul Aurelian was born in Glamorgan in the 6th century. The names &#x27; (&#x27; + territorial suffix &#x27;, &#x27;territory of Morgan&#x27;) and &#x27; (&#x27; + &#x27;, &#x27;land of Morgan&#x27;) reputedly derive from the 8th-century king Morgan ab Athrwys, otherwise known as &quot;Morgan Mwynfawr&quot; (&#x27;great in riches&#x27;) who united &quot;Glywysing&quot; with the neighbouring kingdoms of Gwent and Ergyng, although some have argued for the similar 10th-century ruler Morgan Hen. It is possible it was only the union of Gwent and Glywysing that was referred to as Morgannwg. By virtue of its location and geography, Morgannwg or Glywysing was the second part of Wales, after Gwent, to fall under the control of the Normans and was frequently the scene of fighting between the Marcher Lords and Welsh princes.

====Early buildings====
The earliest buildings of note included earthwork dykes and rudimentary motte-and-bailey hillside defences. All that remains of these fortifications are foundations that leave archaeological evidence of their existence, though many were built upon to create more permanent defensive structures. The earliest surviving structures within the region are early stone monuments, waypoints and grave markers dating between the 5th and 7th century, with many being moved from their original position to sheltered locations for protection. The most notable of the early stone markers still in its original place is on a high mountain ridge at Gelligaer. Of the later plaitwork patterned standing crosses the finest and best preserved is the 9th century &#x27;Houelt&#x27; stone at Llantwit Major.

===Lordship of Glamorgan===

====History, 1080–1536====
The Lordship of Glamorgan was established by Robert Fitzhamon following the defeat of Iestyn ap Gwrgant, . The Lordship of Morgannwg was split after it was conquered; the kingdom of Glamorgan had as its caput the town of Cardiff and took in the lands from the River Tawe to the River Rhymney. The Lordship took in four of the Welsh cantrefi, Gorfynydd, Penychen, Senghenydd and Gwynllwg. The area later known as the Gower Peninsula was not under the Lordship of Glamorgan, and became the Gower Lordship which had previously been the cantref of Gŵyr. The lowlands of the Lordship of Glamorgan were manorialized, while much of the sparsely populated uplands were left under Welsh control until the late 13th century. Upon the death of William, Lord of Glamorgan, his extensive holdings were eventually granted to Gilbert de Clare in 1217. The subjugation of Glamorgan, begun by Fitzhamon, was finally completed by the powerful De Clare family, and in 1486 the kingdom was granted to Jasper Tudor.

====Buildings, 1080–1536====
The legacy of the Marcher Lords left the area scattered with historic buildings including Norman castles, Cistercian Abbeys, churches and medieval monuments.

The kingdom of Glamorgan was also notable for the number of castles built during the time of the Marcher Lords, many surviving to the present day though many are now ruinous. Of the castles built during the medieval period, those still standing above foundation level include, Caerphilly Castle, Cardiff Castle, Ogmore Castle, St Donat&#x27;s Castle, St Quintins Castle, Coity Castle, Neath Castle, and Oystermouth Castle. Many of the castles within Morgannwg were attacked by forces led by Owain Glyndŵr during the Welsh Revolt of 1400–1415. Some were captured, and several were damaged to such an extent they were never maintained as defences again.

When the Diocese of Llandaff became incorporated into the Province of Canterbury, the Bishop of Llandaff rebuilt over the small church with the beginnings of Llandaff Cathedral in 1120. In the western region of Morgannwg two monastic foundations were sited, a Savigniac house in Neath in 1130 and the Cistercian Margam Abbey in 1147. In the Vale a Benedictine monastery was founded in 1141, Ewenny Priory, a community under the patronage of St. Peter&#x27;s Gloucester. The building of parish churches also began in the 12th century, densely in the Vale, but very sparsely in the upland and northern areas.

===County of Glamorgan===

====History 1536–1750====

The Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 established the County of Glamorgan through the amalgamation of the Lordship of Glamorgan with the lordships of Gower and Kilvey; the area that had previously been the cantref of Gwynllwg was lost to Monmouthshire. With Wales finally incorporated with the English dominions, the administration of justice passed into the hands of the crown. The Lordship became a shire and was awarded its first parliamentary representative with the creation of the Glamorganshire constituency in 1536. The Reformation, which was closely followed by the Dissolution of the Monasteries, led to vast social changes across Britain. These events, along with the Act of Union, allowed the leading Welsh families to gain in wealth and prosperity, allowing equal footing to those families of English extraction. Old monasteries, with their lands, were acquired by the wealthy and turned into country houses; their notable residents preferring to live in gentry houses rather than the fortified castles of the past. Major families in Glamorgan included the Carnes at Ewenny, the Mansels at Margam, Williams of Neath, the Herberts at Cardiff and Swansea, Sir David Ap Mathew of Llandaff, and the Stradlings of St Donats.

The main industry of Glamorgan during this period was agriculture. In the upland, or &quot;Blaenau&quot; area, the hilly terrain along with many areas being densely wooded, made arable farming unprofitable, so the local farming concentrated on the rearing of horses, cattle and sheep. The lowland, or &quot;Bro&quot; was devoted to more general branches of farming, cereal, grass for pasture, hay and stock raising. Non-agricultural industries were generally small scale, with some shallow coal pits, fulling mills, weaving and pottery-making. The main heavy industry of note during this period was copper smelting, and this was centred on the towns of Swansea and Neath. Although copper had been mined in Wales since the Bronze Age, it was not until non-ferrous metalworking became a major industry in the late 17th century that Glamorgan saw a concentration of works appearing in a belt between Kidwelly and Port Talbot. Smelting of copper started around Neath under the Mines Royal Society but the scale of the works increased dramatically from the early 18th century when Swansea displaced Bristol as Britain&#x27;s copper smelting capital. Easy access to Cornish ores and a local outcropping of coal near the surface, gave Swansea economic advantages in the smelting industry.

Early iron smelting within Glamorgan was a localised and minor industry, with historical evidence pointing to scattered ironworks throughout the county. John Leland mentions a works at Llantrisant in 1539, an operation in Aberdare existed during the reign of Edward VI and two iron furnaces were recorded as being set up by Sir W. Mathew in Radyr during the Elizabethan era. By 1666 a furnace was in operation in Hirwaun and in 1680 a smelting hearth was established in Caerphilly. Despite the existence of these industries, the scale of production was small, and in 1740 the total output of iron from Glamorgan was reported at 400 tons per year.

Glamorgan, now falling under the protection of the crown, was also involved in the conflicts of the crown. With the start of the First English Civil War, there was little support from the Welsh for the Parliamentarians. Glamorgan sent troops to join Charles I at the Battle of Edgehill, and their Member of Parliament Sir Edward Stradling was captured in the conflict. In the Second English Civil War, the war came to Glamorgan at the Battle of St Fagans (1648), where the New Model Army overcame a larger Royalist to prevent a siege of Cardiff.

====Buildings, 1536–1750====
The period between the Laws in Wales Acts and the industrialisation of Glamorgan saw two distinct periods architecturally. From the 1530s throughout to 1650, the newly empowered gentry attempted to show their status by building stately homes to show their wealth; but the period from 1650 through to the mid-1750s was a fallow time for architectural grandeur, with few new wealthy families moving to the area. Of the eight major gentry houses of the time only St Fagans Castle survives with its interior intact; five, Neath Abbey, Old Beaupre Castle, Oxwich Castle, Llantrithyd and Ruperra Castle are ruinous. Of the remaining two manors, The Van at Caerphilly was reconstructed in 1990 while Cefnmabli was gutted by a fire in 1994. The old castles became abandoned throughout this period due to the new security brought by Glamorgan coming under the protection of the crown, with only the Stradlings of St Donat&#x27;s Castle electing to remain in their old ancestral home.

By the 17th century, the availability of fine building stone permitted the construction of high-quality lime-washed rural cottages and farmhouses in the Vale of Glamorgan, which drew favourable remarks from travellers. A Glamorgan yeoman of the time generally lived in greater comfort than his contemporaries of the more westerly or upland parts of Wales such as Cardiganshire or north Carmarthenshire.

====Industrial Glamorgan, 1750–1920====

=====Metals industry=====
From the mid-18th century onwards, Glamorgan&#x27;s uplands underwent large-scale industrialisation and several coastal towns, in particular Swansea and later Cardiff, became significant ports. From the late 18th century until the early 20th century Glamorgan produced 70 per cent of the British output of copper. The industry was developed by English entrepreneurs and investors such as John Henry Vivian and largely based in the west of the county, where coal could be purchased cheaply and ores imported from Cornwall, Devon and later much further afield. The industry was of immense importance to Swansea in particular; in 1823 the smelting works on the River Tawe, and the collieries and shipping dependent on them, supported between 8,000 and 10,000 people. Imports of copper ores reached a peak in the 1880s, after which there was a steep fall until the virtual end of the trade in the 1920s. The cost of shipping ores from distant countries, and the growth of foreign competitors, ended Glamorgan&#x27;s dominance of the industry. Some of the works converted to the production of zinc and the Tawe valley also became a location for the manufacture of nickel after Ludwig Mond established a works at Clydach in 1902.

Even at its peak, copper smelting was never as significant as iron smelting, which was the major industrial employer of men and capital in south Wales before the rise of the sale-coal industry. Ironmaking developed in locations where ironstone, coal and limestone were found in close proximity – primarily the northern and south-western parts of the South Wales coalfield. In the second half of the 18th century four ironworks were built in Merthyr Tydfil. In 1759 the Dowlais Ironworks were established by a partnership of nine men. This was followed by the Plymouth Ironworks in 1763, which was formed by Isaac Wilkinson and John Guest, then in 1765 Anthony Bacon established the Cyfarthfa Ironworks. The fourth of the great ironworks, Penydarren Ironworks was built in 1784. These works made Merthyr Tydfil the main centre of the industry in Wales.

As well as copper and iron, Glamorgan became an important centre for the tinplate industry. Although not as famous as the Llanelli or Pontypool works, a concentrated number of works emerged around Swansea, Aberavon and Neath towards the late 19th century. Glamorgan became the most populous and industrialised county in Wales and was known as the &#x27;crucible of the Industrial Revolution&#x27;.

Other areas to house heavy industries include ironworks in Maesteg (1826), tinplate works in Llwydarth and Pontyclun and an iron ore mine in Llanharry.

Alongside the metalworks, industries appeared throughout Glamorgan that made use of the works&#x27; output. Pontypridd was well known for the Brown Lenox Chainworks, which during the 19th century was the town&#x27;s main industrial employer.

=====Coal industry=====
The largest change to industrial Glamorgan was the opening up of the South Wales coalfield, the largest continuous coalfield in Britain, which occupied the greater part of Glamorgan, mostly north of the Vale. The coalfield provided a vast range in quality and type, but prior to 1750 the only real access to the seams was through bell pits or digging horizontally into a level where the seam was exposed at a river bank or mountainside. Although initially excavated for export, coal was soon also needed for the smelting process in Britain&#x27;s expanding metallurgical industries. Developments in coal mining began in the north-eastern rim of Glamorgan around the ironworks of Merthyr and in the south-west around the copper plants of Swansea. In 1828 the South Wales coalfield was producing an estimated 3 million tons of coal, by 1840 that had risen to 4.5 million, with about 70 percent consumed by local commercial and domestic usage.

The 1840s saw the start of a dramatic increase in the amount of coal excavated within Glamorgan. Several events took place to precipitate the growth in coal mining, including the discovery of steam coal in the Cynon Valley, the building of a large masonry dock at Cardiff and the construction of the Taff Vale Railway. In 1845, after trials by the British Admiralty, Welsh steam coal replaced coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne as the preferred fuel for the ships of the Royal Navy. Glamorgan steam coal quickly became a sought-after commodity for navies all over the world and its production increased to meet the demand.

The richest source for steam coal was the Rhondda Valleys, and by 1856 the Taff Vale Railway had reached the heads of both valleys. Over the next fifty years the Rhondda would grow to become the largest producer of coal of the age. In 1874, the Rhondda produced 2.13 million tons of coal, which rose to 5.8 million tons by 1884. The coal now produced in Glamorgan far exceeded the interior demand, and in the later half of the 19th century the area became a mass exporter for its product. In the 1890s the docks of South Wales accounted for 38 percent of British coal exports and a quarter of global trade.

Along with the increase in coal production came a very large increase in the population, as people emigrated to the area to seek employment. In Aberdare the population grew from 6,471 in 1841 to 32,299 in 1851 while the Rhondda grew from 3,035 in 1861 to 55,632 in 1881, peaking in 1921 at 162,729. Much of this population growth was driven by immigration. In the ten years from 1881 to 1891, net migration to Glamorgan was over 76,000, 63 percent of which was from the non-border counties of England – a proportion that increased in the following decade.

=====Agriculture=====
Until the beginning of the 18th century, Glamorgan was almost entirely agriculture based. With the industrialisation of the county, farming became of far less importance, with industrial areas encroaching into farming lands. In Glamorgan, from the late 19th century, there was a significant reduction away from arable land towards pasture land. There were two main factors behind this trend; firstly the increase in the population of the county required more milk and other dairy produce, in an age before refrigeration. Secondly there was an employment shortage in farming due to the call of better paid industrial work, and pastoral land was less work intensive. Stock rearing became prominent with breeds such as Hereford, Devon and Shorthorn cattle being bred in the Vale of Glamorgan, while the unenclosed wilds of the Gower saw Welsh Ponies bred on the commons.

====Buildings of note 1750–1920====
The industrial period of Glamorgan saw a massive building program throughout the uplands and in the coastal regions, reflecting the increasing population and the need for new cheap housing to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of workers coming into the area. As the towns urbanised and the hamlets became villages, the trappings of modern life were reflected in the buildings required to sustain new and growing communities. The period saw the appearance, not only of the works and pits themselves, but of the terrace house or miners cottage, railway stations, hospitals, churches, chapels, bridges, viaducts, stadiums, schools, universities, museums and workingmen&#x27;s halls.

As well as the architecture of Glamorgan entering modernity, there was also a reflection to the past, with some individuals who made the most from the booming industrial economy restoring symbols of the past, building follies and commissioning Gothic-style additions to ancient churches. Robert Lugar&#x27;s Cyfarthfa Castle in Merthyr (1825) and the late 19th century additions to Cardiff Castle, designed by William Burges, exemplify how Gothic was the favoured style for rich industrialists and entrepreneurs. Greek Revival architecture, popularised in France and Germany in the late 18th century, was used for a number of public and educational buildings in Wales including the Royal Institution of South Wales in Swansea (1841) and Bridgend Town Hall (1843).

In 1897, Cardiff Corporation acquired land from the Marquess of Bute with the intention of erecting buildings to meet the administrative, legal and educational needs of Glamorgan&#x27;s county town. From 1901 onwards, Cathays Park was developed into &quot;possibly the finest... civic centre in Britain&quot; with a range of public buildings including the Baroque City Hall and the rococo-style University College.

The majority of Nonconformist chapels were built in the 19th century. They progressed from simple, single-storey designs to larger and more elaborate structures, most built in the classical style. Perhaps the most ambitious chapel was John Humphrey&#x27;s Morriston Tabernacle (1872), incorporating Classical, Romanesque and Gothic elements, which has been called the &#x27;Noncomformist Cathedral of Wales&#x27;.

Industrial architecture tended to be functional, although some structures, such as the four-storey engine house at Cyfarthfa Ironworks (1836), were built to impress. Coal mining eventually became the dominant industry in Glamorgan and tall winding towers – originally made of timber or cast iron, later steel – became symbolic icons.

====Late-period Glamorgan, 1920–1974====
After the First World War, there was an initial drop in coal and iron production, there was still enough demand to push the coalfields to their limits, helped by events such as the American coal miners&#x27; strike. Cardiff Docks reached an exporting peak in 1923, but soon production fell and unemployment in the upland valleys began to increase at a dramatic rate. Between April 1924 and August 1925 the unemployment rate amongst South Wales miners jumped from 1.8% to 28.5%. Several factors came together to cause this collapse, including the over-valuation of sterling, the end of the coal subsidy, the growth of electric power, the adoption of oil as the fuel of choice for many industries, and over-expansion of the mines in the late nineteenth century. The Welsh coal owners had failed to invest mechanisation during the good years, and by the 1930s the South Wales Coalfield had the lowest productivity, highest production costs and smallest profits of all Britain&#x27;s coal-producing regions.

These structural problems were followed by the General Strike of 1926 and then most disastrously the interwar depression of 1929–1931, which changed the face of industrial Glamorgan forever. In 1932, Glamorgan had an unemployment rate of more than 40 per cent, and one of the highest proportions of people receiving poor relief in the United Kingdom. This was a contrast with relatively recent prosperity: for example, in 1913 unemployment in Merthyr was below 2 per cent and the borough had 24,000 miners. By 1921, the number of employed miners had fallen to 16,000, and in 1934, it was down to 8,000.

Steel production was no less depressed than the coal industry. The inter-war years saw the closure of the old Cyfarthfa and Dowlais works, as steel-making became increasingly concentrated in the coastal belt. Both the coal and steel industries were increasingly dominated by large amalgamations, such as Powell Duffryn and Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds. The smaller companies progressively disappeared.

Glamorgan suffered disproportionately during the Great Depression because of the high proportion of its workforce employed in primary production rather than the manufacture of finished products. Other parts of Britain began to recover as domestic demand for consumer products picked up, but unemployment in the South Wales Valleys continued to rise: the jobless rate in Merthyr reached 47.5 per cent in June 1935. However, the coastal ports, Cardiff and Swansea, managed to sustain a &quot;reasonable&quot; level of economic activity, and the anthracite coalfield in western Glamorgan (and eastern Carmarthenshire) also managed to maintain production and exports above pre-war levels.

With the outbreak of World War II the coalfields of Glamorgan saw a sharp rise in trade and employment. Despite the demand the want for the youth to conscript in the war effort in the valley areas meant that there was a shortage of workers to run the mines; this in turn saw the introduction of the Bevin Boys, workers conscripted to work in the mines. During the war both Cardiff and Swansea were targets for German air attacks due to their important docks.

====Buildings and structures, 1920–1974====
After the First World War, Glamorgan, as was typical for Britain as a whole, entered a period of modernity, which saw buildings built and designed for functionality rather than splendour with period features watered down. As the century progressed, symbols of the past industrial period were torn down and replaced with industrial estates populated by unadorned geometric factories. With concrete becoming the favourite post-war building material, larger office blocks began appearing within the cities, though few were of any architectural significance.

Despite entering a fallow period of architectural design, several structures of note did emerge. Although work began in 1911, The National Museum of Wales (Smith and Brewer) was not completed until 1927 due to the First World War. Designed to reflect sympathetically in dimensions with its neighbouring city hall, the dome-topped museum combines many architectural motifs with Doric columns at its facade, while internally a large entrance hall with stairs, landings and balconies. Percy Thomas&#x27; Guildhall in Swansea, an example of the &#x27;stripped modernist&#x27; style completed in 1936, was described as &quot;Wales&#x27; finest interwar building&quot;.

Although functionality often deprived a building of interest, Sully Hospital (Pite, Son &amp; Fairweather) is an example of a building which gained from its functional requirements. Initially built for tubercular patients, whose cure required the maximum amount of light and air, the functional architecture left a striking glass-fronted building, completed in 1936.

Another hospital to which functionalism was applied was the University Hospital of Wales (S.W. Milburn &amp; Partners). Begun in the 1960s, and completed in 1971, the building is the third largest hospital in the United Kingdom and the largest in Wales. It was designed to bring the care of patients, research and medical teaching together under one roof.

The demands of modern living saw the growth of housing estates throughout Glamorgan, moving away from the Victorian terrace of Cardiff or the ribbon cottages of the valleys. Several of these projects were failures architecturally and socially. Of note were the Billybanks estate in Penarth and Penrhys Estate (Alex Robertson, Peter Francis &amp; Partners) in the Rhondda, both described by Malcolm Parry, the former Head of the School of Architecture at Cardiff University, as &quot;...the worst examples of architecture and planning in Wales.&quot;

== Geography ==
The area that was Glamorgan can be divided into three distinct and contrasting geographical areas. To the south east is a gently undulating limestone plateau, virtually coterminous with the modern county borough of Vale of Glamorgan, mainly comprising farmland and small villages stretching from Porthcawl to Cardiff. The lowlands are geographically the best environment for agriculture of the three areas. Settlements in the area included Cardiff, Barry, Bridgend, Cowbridge, Penarth and Porthcawl.

The northern part of the county was a mountainous area, dissected by deep narrow valleys. At the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons, the simple geological structure of Old Red Sandstone gives way to Carboniferous rocks; limestone, shales and millstone grit. In the 19th century, industrial and population growth in the coal-bearing valleys of the Rhymney, Taff, Dare and Rhondda gave rise to a form of urbanisation characterised as ribbon development. The last deep mine, Tower Colliery at Hirwaun, closed in January 2008. A few small drift mines like Unity Mine (formerly Pentreclwydau South) near Glynneath remain. Towns in the region included Aberdare, Caerphilly, Pontypridd, Maesteg, Merthyr Tydfil and Mountain Ash.

Further west was Swansea Bay and the Gower Peninsula, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Of all the areas, Gower was the least affected by heavy industry and the ancient landscape was the least impaired. The high ground that runs centrally through the Gower was largely uncultivated common land and its beaches and rocky coastal headlands showed little signs of the tourist trade that played an increasing role on the local economy. The major settlements of the region included Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot.

===Coastline===

The coastline of Glamorgan stretched for 88 miles from Trowbridge in the east to Gower in the west. It was divided naturally into three distinct sections. The coast of the Vale of Glamorgan was mainly characterised by cliffs, while from Porthcawl to Swansea Bay wide sandy shores prevail. The final section, the Gower coast, was made up of a rugged and serrated peninsula.

From the east the first major coastline feature was the Rhymney River, once seen as the natural border between Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, until the absorption of Trowbridge into the Cardiff district in 1936. Heading west, the coast was an expanse of alluvial deposits stretching to the mouth of Glamorgan&#x27;s most well known river, the River Taff. Once marshland, the area was consumed by the rapid growth of the Cardiff Docks during the industrial revolution, but with the downturn in Glamorgan&#x27;s iron and coal industries, the docks declined. Also flowing into Cardiff Docks is the River Ely, which separates Cardiff from the headland and seaside resort of Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan. Here the coast stretches southwards for two and a half miles from Penarth Head to Lavernock Point, hidden from vessels travelling up the Bristol Channel. South easterly from Lavernock Point, roughly three miles out in the Channel Estuary is Flat Holm, an island which although geographically is within the Vale, is administered as part of the city of Cardiff. Flat Holm was the most southerly point of Glamorgan and Wales.

From Lavernock Point the coast heads sharply west to the town of Barry, a well-known seaside resort, Barry is most notable for its rapid expansion during the late 19th century to become an important dock, at one stage surpassing Cardiff Dock for the tonnage of coal exported. Passing the cliffs of Barry Island the coastline becomes a low-lying promontory called the Lays, which continues west taking in the villages of Rhoose and Aberthaw before reaching Breaksea Point, the most southerly point of mainland Wales. Beyond the point is Limpert Bay, which was overlooked by the village of Gileston and the ancient encampment of Summerhouse Point. Here the cliffs rise and run for eleven miles as far as the estuary of the Ogmore. Along this run of cliffs the coast passes Llantwit Major and St Donats, before heading in a rough north-west direction at Nash Point.

The coastline remains as steep cliffs until after Dunraven Head, where the cliff face drops away to expose Southerndown Beach. Two miles beyond, the Ogmore River runs out into a sand-locked bay which can be seen as commencing the second section of the Glamorgan coast, as here the scenery undergoes an abrupt change; from a series of unbroken cliffs to vast regions of sandy beaches. The Ogmore Bay at Ogmore-by-Sea was not only floored with sand but was also backed by high and extensive sand dune system, these impressive natural sand features are commonly known as the Merthyr Mawr sand dunes. Beyond the bay the underlying rocks emerge from the sand to form the promontory of Porthcawl Point. Porthcawl town, once possessing a small dock, abandoned the trade in favour of tourism. The coast continues to the north west as a low rocky formation for three miles to Sker Point, after which the sand line begins again, forming an arid wilderness all the way to Port Talbot. Port Talbot was one of the later industrial towns of Glamorgan, and grew out of the medieval village of Aberavon, a settlement built on the banks of the River Afan. To the west of the mouth of the Afan is the new district of Sandfields, built over the holiday dunes of Aberavon beach in the 1950s to house the workforce of Port Talbot Steelworks.

The River Afan commences the wide sweep of Swansea Bay, which from Port Talbot arcs around taking in Baglan Bay, Briton Ferry, Swansea and ending in Mumbles. The whole bay is shut in by high hills and is thickly encircled with sands. Within the bay are two of the major estuaries of Glamorgan; from Port Talbot the first is the River Neath, which is protected by long breakwaters. The second is the Tawe, the central river of Swansea. Beyond the Tawe the bay sweeps for six miles before reaching Mumbles Head, its most westerly point. Mumbles Head is served by Mumbles Lighthouse, which sits on the further of two small islands off the head.

At The Mumbles, the coastline begins its third phase, commencing the wild and rugged cliffs of the Gower. From Mumbles Head to Worm&#x27;s Head, 20 miles to the west, the coast consists of a series of precipitous cliffs, interrupted by a number of sandy bays. The most notable of the bays include Langland Bay, Caswell Bay, Pwlldu Bay, Three Cliffs Bay and Oxwich Bay. Three Cliffs Bay and the adjoining Oxwich Bay are overlooked by three medieval defences, Pennard Castle, Penrice Castle and Oxwich Castle, all three now ruinous. Oxwich Bay ends in the large wooded promontory of Oxwich Point, which leads west to the beach front villages of Horton and Port Eynon. From Port Eynon Point, a five-mile stretch of wild and impressive cliffs leads to Worm&#x27;s Head and the western termination of the peninsula. This rock face is pierced in places by caverns, the most notable being Culver Hole a bone cave near Port Eynon Point.

Worm&#x27;s Head is one of the stand out features of the Glamorgan coastline, a long narrow ledge of limestone, projecting into the sea, ending in a 200-foot high wedge shaped crag; the Head takes its name from its resemblance to a dragon. On the northern side of the Worm&#x27;s Head is the village and Bay of Rhossili, a westerly facing bay that leads backwards to a series of downs, some of the highest land in the Gower. Rhossili Bay ends in the northern formation of Llangenydd Burrows and the islet of Burry Holms. The final stretch of Glamorgan coastline turns north-east to form the Burry Inlet, a shallow and sand-choked estuary which leads to a tract of salt marshes which stretch to the mouth of the River Loughor. The Loughor forming the border between Glamorgan and Carmarthenshire.

===Rivers===
The major rivers of Glamorgan include the Taff, the Ely, the Ogmore, the Neath, Dulais, the Tawe, the Rhymney (which forms the historic boundary with Monmouthshire), and the Loughor (which forms the historic boundary with Carmarthenshire).

==Administration==
After the fall of the Welsh kingdom of Morgannwg to Robert FitzHamon in 1091, the region became the English Lordship of Glamorgan, sometimes called the Lordship of Glamorgan and Morgan because it was divided into the Norman settled Plain or Vale of Glamorgan and the Welsh upland area called Morgannwg, anglicised to Morgan. Both areas were under the control of the Norman Lords of Glamorgan (often the Earls of Gloucester). As well as building a military and defensive network, the Normans also undertook an ecclesiastical reorganisation on Glamorgan. In Llandaff there was a small monastic community based on a small church; which was made the headquarters of the diocese, incorporated into the Province of Canterbury. The Diocese of Llandaff covered almost the entirety of Glamorgan and continued throughout the history of the county of Glamorgan, and through to modern times.

In 1536, the Laws in Wales Act 1535 attached the Lordship of Gower and Kilvey to Glamorgan and created the historic county of Glamorgan. Along with gaining parliamentary representation in 1536, Glamorgan became part of the King&#x27;s circuit, with judges from England administering law at the Great Session or Assizes. Local magistrates were appointed to deal with petty sessions while Lords Lieutenant were appointed as the King&#x27;s representative. Law enforcement within the confines of the shire was the responsibility of the High Sheriff of Glamorgan.

From the 1790s a call was made for parliamentary reform to address the imbalance between the number of Members of Parliament for each Welsh county and the population each seat represented. Radnorshire had only a tenth of the population of Glamorganshire, though Radnorshire had one MP to Glamorganshire&#x27;s two (Glamorgan and the District of Cardiff). The First Reform Act (1832) gave five more seats to Wales, three went to Glamorganshire. The Act increased the number of MPs for Glamorganshire from one to two, it created the separate District of Swansea and Merthyr Tydfil became a borough constituency. Reflecting the increased importance and wealth of Merthyr the borough was given a second MP after the Reform Act 1867. However, the 1867 Act had only a limited impact in Glamorgan as the majority of the population lived in the county constituency. Out of 162,241 inhabitants of the county in 1880, only 12,785 had the vote. Conversely, the borough electorate, in Cardiff, Swansea and Merthyr Tydfil had been greatly expanded. This was particularly true of Merthyr where the electorate was increased tenfold to 14,577. As a result, the nonconformist radical, Henry Richard, was returned as senior member for Merthyr, an important watershed in Welsh political history.

In 1884, the county members were the octogenarian C.R.M. Talbot, who had served since 1830 and the Swansea industrialist, Hussey Vivian, first elected in 1857. In 1885, all ten of the Glamorgan seats were captured by the Liberal Party and this election represented the triumph of the nonconformist middle classes. However, the political representation of Glamorgan was transformed between 1884 and 1922. By 1922, the county was represented by eleven Labour MPs. The transformation commenced with the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. Glamorganshire was split from its two Members of Parliament to five, with the creation of constituencies for East, Mid and South Glamorganshire, Gower and Rhondda. An additional Swansea Town constituency was created, distinct from Swansea District but the Cardiff constituency remained unchanged, and with over 85,000 inhabitants became the largest single-member constituency in the United Kingdom. At this election, all ten members returned for Glamorgan were Liberals, an event which marked the ascendancy of the nonconformist middle-class as a powerful political force. Although most of these seats now had the working-class electorate in a majority they were safe for the Liberals as long as the labour element remained in the Liberal fold.

An administrative county of Glamorgan was created under the Local Government Act 1888, excluding Swansea and Cardiff, which became independent county boroughs. In 1908, county borough status was also granted to Merthyr Tydfil, despite protests from the southern part of the borough, where it was claimed that links were stronger with Pontypridd. In 1935, a Royal Commission argued that Merthyr Tydfil County Borough, then heavily burdened by the cost of maintaining many unemployed people, should be abolished and merged with Glamorgan. The county council refused the proposal.

The first chairman of the County Council was Henry Vivian, 1st Baron Swansea. The county council&#x27;s coat of arms, granted in 1950, was: &quot;Or, three chevronels gules between as many Tudor roses barbed and seeded proper&quot;. The red chevronels on a gold shield were the arms of the De Clare Marcher Lords, while the roses recorded the shiring of Glamorgan by Henry VIII. The crest above the shield was a Welsh dragon rising from flames, symbolising the revival of the county&#x27;s industry following a period of economic depression. The dragon supported a flag bearing a clarion from the arms of the De Granville family, lords of Neath. The supporters of the arms were a coalminer and a steel worker. The motto adopted by the county council: or &#x27;He Who suffered, conquered&#x27; was that of the lineage of Iestyn ap Gwrgant, and was considered appropriate to an area whose wealth depended on great hardship.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, the county boroughs and administrative county of Glamorgan were abolished on 1 April 1974, with three new counties being established, each containing a former county borough: West Glamorgan, Mid Glamorgan, South Glamorgan. It 1996 these areas were reorganised into several unitary authorities by the Local Government Act of 1994. The South Wales Police force covers an area that is similar to Glamorgan. Since 2013, Glamorgan has had its own official flag, red with three white chevrons.

=== Civil parishes ===
Until 1974 Glamorgan was divided into civil parishes, which in the medieval period comprised the following 125 parishes, listed by hundred (with chapelries in &quot;italics&quot;):
==Transport==

===Roads===
The earliest forms of transport within Glamorgan were mere paths or trackways linking one settlement to another. With continual use the tracks widened to allow different forms of travel, including the use by pack horses; and as the tracks became more recognisable the first primitive roads came into being. The Romans established a route, Via Julia Maritima, to service their garrisons across South Wales and this is followed largely by the present A48. However, for 1,000 years after the Romans there was little need for major roads. Early roads were not systematically managed, and in Glamorgan as in the rest of Wales, they were in a very poor state. Towards Tudor times the upkeep and repair of the roads came under the administration of each parish, with six days of the week during the summer allowed for track repairs. These repairs were rarely completed and the roadways continued to suffer. The Highways Act 1555 required each landowner to produce a cart, horses or bullocks, and two men to work 4 days on roads. Supervision was by two unpaid surveyors appointed by the parish. By the late 1600s the situation improved as surveyors were appointed by the magistrates, who were allowed to levy a rate to pay for some of the work.

In 1756, after the shire of Glamorgan had come under the rule of the crown, Wales adopted a toll system for the maintenance of the roads; with the governance falling under the control of the turnpike trusts. Further Turnpike Acts came into force in 1799 and 1810, and these Acts allowed trustees to collect a toll for the use of certain roads within a district. In South Wales there were turnpikes along the coast, more or less following the present motorway line, up the Merthyr Valley and across the hills to Abergavenny, Brecon, Llandovery and down to Carmarthen. This system improved travelling conditions, allowing for stage coaches which were then coming into general use. Although the roads improved there were those who felt that the tolls were unjust, and there was a popular uprising between 1839 and 1843 known as the Rebecca Riots where agitators attacked and destroyed the toll houses. Although most of these attacks occurred in Carmarthenshire, there were reports of attacks within Glamorgan, most notably in Swansea. In 1846, county highway boards were established in south Wales, to buy out the turnpike trusts and take over their functions. In 1878 all roads that had ceased to be turnpiked after 1870 were deemed as &#x27;main roads&#x27; by the Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act 1878. The turnpike system was eventually abolished by the Local Government Act 1888 and the roads were placed under the management of the local county council. County highway boards were disbanded. There were, however, a number of urban areas within Glamorgan that retained the right to control their own highways, and the county council never achieved control of the whole highway network.

Proposals for a high-quality new road across South Wales were first made in the 1930s. However, the dualling of the A48 Neath bypass was only completed in 1960, with the A48(M) Port Talbot bypass following in 1966. The latter road, an early example of dual carriageway construction through a built-up area, was the first length of motorway opened to traffic in Wales. The Ministry of Transport initially envisaged that the new M4 motorway would terminate at Tredegar Park near Newport, with a series of bypasses to improve the A48 further west. The creation of the Welsh Office led to a re-appraisal of policy and a decision to extend the M4 further into Glamorgan. By 1970, the Welsh Office was committed to building a new route all the way to Pont Abraham in Carmarthenshire. The 1960s also saw the construction of the first road across the Heads of the Valleys, with the A465 Neath-Abergavenny trunk road opening in 1964. However, even at the outset there were complaints about the capacity and safety of its single carriageway, three-lane design.

===Waterways and ports===
Due to Glamorgan&#x27;s long coastline, several settlements grew and prospered as harbour and port towns. In 1801, Swansea was Glamorgan&#x27;s largest urban area with a population five times that of Cardiff&#x27;s. Cowbridge was the capital town of the Vale, and the centre of agricultural trade, with surplus stock being shipped to the coastal village of Aberthaw and to a lesser extent Newton. Where there were breaks in the rocky coastline, small fishing and cockling communities existed, such as Port Eynon and Penclawdd.

The event that changed the face of coastal Glamorgan was the growth of the Merthyr iron industry. Merthyr needed a coastal export point for its iron and Cardiff was the obvious choice being at the mouth of the River Taff. A road was built to connect the two towns, but with only horses to move the cargo, transportation was cumbersome; therefore an alternative was planned. Although Glamorgan had a large number of rivers, few were navigable for any considerable length. Between 1790 and 1794, acts of Parliament were obtained for the construction of three canals within Glamorgan, the Glamorganshire Canal (1790), Neath Canal (1791) and the Swansea Canal (1794). All three were vital in increasing the transportation of iron, copper, steel and coal from the uplands of the county to the ports at Swansea and Cardiff. Although the first stages of all three canals were completed by 1800 and revolutionised the commercial transportation systems of Glamorgan; in 1804 at Penydarren Ironworks, Richard Trevithick&#x27;s &quot;Pen-y-Darren&quot; locomotive became the first engine to pull a load along rails; heralding the coming of the railways, which would eventually replace the canals.

The port at Cardiff grew quickly during the 19th century, not as a mass exporter of iron but of coal, transported from Pontypridd and the Cynon and Rhondda Valleys. From 1840 to 1870 Cardiff&#x27;s export tonnage of coal increased from 44,350 to 2,219,000. By 1871, Cardiff had outgrown all of its Welsh rivals to become the most populous town in the country Swansea Docks continued to be the world&#x27;s leading exporter of copper, but did not experience the growth of Cardiff due to poor links to the coalfields. Ambitious attempts were made to link Swansea&#x27;s docks to coal rich areas, such as the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, but these plans were never truly economically successful. The biggest threat to Cardiff&#x27;s dominance came in the early 20th century at Barry. In 1881, Barry had 484 inhabitants, after an 1884 act of Parliament authorising the construction of a docks and railway link, the town grew to over 27,000 by 1901. The chief advocate of Barry&#x27;s growth as a dock was David Davies, and in 1901 Barry was exporting more coal than Cardiff, peaking in 1913 when it shipped 11.41 million tons.

The interwar depression experienced by Great Britain brought an end to the prosperity of the Glamorgan ports. During the Second World War, the main ports of Glamorgan were heavily targeted by German bombing raids, though exports were not severely disrupted. By the second half of the 20th century none of the county&#x27;s docks showed any growth, and with the collapse of the coal trade in South Wales Cardiff and Barry Docks became near derelict, shipping mainly general cargo. Swansea also suffered a vast reduction on trade with the end of the area as a world leader in copper smelting. The only dock to remain a viable exporter was the Port of Port Talbot. First built in 1839, the docks at Port Talbot were a minor concern in relation to the more established ports, but exports increased after the 1916 with the completion of the Margam Steelworks. Exports continued strongly when the Abbey Works were built in 1952. Port Talbot would eventually become the biggest exporting port in Glamorgan, and the second largest in Wales, only surpassed by Milford Haven.

===Rail===
Before the use of locomotives, railway track was used at various stages of the canal system to link locations to which the waterways could not reach. These wagons on these tramlines would be pulled by horse over wooden rails, which later were replaced by wrought iron. In 1809 Richard Griffiths built a private tram-road to the Glamorganshire Canal from his coal mine in Gyfeillion. The Gyfeillion site was extended further in 1811 to link Walter Coffin&#x27;s mine at Dinas Rhondda, allowing the first viable transport link from the Rhondda coal fields to the ports of Cardiff.

The first railway network to be built in Glamorgan, the Taff Vale Railway, was also the first in Wales. Linking the ironworks of Merthyr to the ports of Cardiff, the Taff Vale line was given royal assent in 1836, with work commencing the same year. It was completed in 1840, and as well as carrying goods the trains made limited passenger trips from the very beginning. By 1856 the Taff Vale Railway was extended to service the top of the Rhondda Valleys at Treherbert and Maerdy, which allowed the exploitation of the minefields in one of the most coal-rich areas of Britain. The second major railway to open was the South Wales Railway, linking Gloucester in England to Neyland. The line was designed to link the coalfields of Glamorgan to London, and was also part of Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s vision of a transport link from London to New York. The South Wales Railway serviced Cardiff, Bridgend, Neath and Swansea, with its final destination within Glamorgan being Loughor, before continuing through Carmarthenshire. Other railway lines that opened during the mid to late 19th century included the Vale of Neath Railway, the Swansea Vale Railway and the Rhymney Railway; all designed with the primary purpose of transporting metals and coal from the uplands of the county to the ever-expanding ports. The cargo carried on these lines was of a very high volume, and in 1850 the Taff Vale Railway was transporting 600,000 tons of coal per annum.

Towards the turn of the 19th century, two notable events occurred connected to the Taff Vale Railway. In 1888, the Barry Railway Company was formed as part of David Davies&#x27; plan to create an alternative export port in south Wales at Barry Docks. As a threat to the monopoly of the TVR, the plans were heavily contested in Parliament, and more parliamentary time was spent on the Barry bill than on any other railway bill in British history. The second event saw the Taff Vale Railway Strike of 1900, an event that saw the House of Lords, in the Taff Vale Case, deem trade unions accountable for the financial losses caused by strike action. The need to reverse the decision was a central factor in the creation of the British Labour Party.

In the 20th century, the railways saw a gradual drop in usage as the heavy industrial works and mines began to reduce output and close and many stations became redundant. Following the Second World War, the railways were nationalised in 1948. In the 1960s the main line services in Wales underwent dieselisation, but this modernisation failed to save the rail system and by 1968 many passenger lines were discontinued by the Beeching Axe.

===Airports===
Glamorgan was served by several airports and airfields, with Cardiff Airport being the county&#x27;s chief airport. Cardiff Airport grew from a former RAF station built in 1942 at Rhoose, and was originally known as Rhoose Airport. In 1970 it became &#x27;Glamorgan, Rhoose Airport&#x27; before becoming &#x27;Cardiff-Wales airport&#x27; in the 1980s.

Glamorgan&#x27;s second commercial airport was Swansea Airport which also began as an RAF station, before being released to commercial usage in 1956. The airport saw varying degrees of success until regular flights ceased in 1969. Several other airports and aerodromes have serviced Glamorgan, but usually for private flights. The most notorious aviation disaster in Wales occurred in Glamorgan in 1950, when a privately hired Avro Tudor crashed at Llandow Aerodrome. The Llandow air disaster was, at the time, the world&#x27;s worst aviation disaster.

==Culture and recreation==

===Sport===
Sport was an important part of life in Glamorgan, and the county produced several individuals and teams of note. One of the first recorded team sports in Wales was bando, a variant of bandy. The game was very popular in Glamorgan between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before losing in popularity to rugby football. The most notable team to carry the name Glamorgan, is Glamorgan County Cricket Club. Although cricket had been established in Glamorgan since the creation of Cardiff Cricket Club in 1819; county team Glamorgan CCC did not form until 1888. The team gained first-class status in 1921, and still play under the name of Glamorgan. In the first hundred years, the only Welshman to captain an England major tour abroad was Tony Lewis, Glamorgan captain 1967–72.

The other bat and ball team sport of note in the area was baseball, which was very popular in Cardiff, reaching its peak in the 1930s.

One of the most popular sports in Glamorgan was rugby union, producing some of the oldest rugby clubs in the world. Swansea RFC, Cardiff RFC and Merthyr RFC were founding members of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1881, and both St. Helen&#x27;s Rugby and Cricket Ground (Swansea) and the Cardiff Arms Park (Cardiff), have been sporting venues for international rugby. Like cricket, rugby union was also played at county level, with Glamorgan represented by Glamorgan County RFC, an invitational team which faced the likes of the All Blacks and the Springboks in the early part of the 20th century. Other rugby clubs of note from the region include Bridgend RFC, Glamorgan Wanderers RFC, Neath RFC and Pontypridd RFC. Although never finding any lasting appeal within Glamorgan, a number of rugby league teams emerged in the early 1900s; and on 1 January 1908, the first true international rugby league game took place in Aberdare between Wales and New Zealand.

As well as rugby and cricket, association football was a very popular sport in Glamorgan, producing two teams with a long tradition in British football, Swansea City (formed 1912 as Swansea Town A.F.C.) and Cardiff City (formed 1899 as Riverside AFC). Both clubs played in the English football league system, rather than the Welsh leagues, though Cardiff were more successful during this period, spending 15 seasons in the First Division and winning the FA Cup in 1927. Other teams of note include Merthyr Tydfil F.C. (1945), who have won the Welsh Cup on three occasions.

Of all the individual sports, boxing was perhaps Glamorgan&#x27;s most prolific. From the northern coalfields and ironworks a string of world class boxers were produced, which was later matched by notable fighters from Cardiff. Of note were Rhondda&#x27;s Percy Jones (World Flyweight Champion), Tom Thomas (British Middleweight Champion), Jimmy Wilde (World Flyweight Champion) and Tommy Farr (Empire Heavyweight Champion); Merthyr&#x27;s Eddie Thomas (European Welterweight Champion) and Howard Winstone (European Featherweight Champion); Pontypridd&#x27;s Freddie Welsh (World Lightweight Champion) and Frank Moody (Empire Middleweight Champion). From Cardiff came &#x27;Peerless&#x27; Jim Driscoll (British Featherweight Champion) and Jack Petersen (British Heavyweight Champion). Other fighters of note include Dai Dower (European Flyweight Champion) from Abercynon and Bill Beynon (Empire Bantamweight Champion) from Taibach.

===Tourism===
Glamorgan, and Wales, were never exploited as a tourist destination until the late 18th century. The destination of choice for English gentlemen during the period was the Grand Tour, but after conflicts in mainland Europe, British travellers looked for &#x27;wild&#x27; destinations within their own country. These first tourists were important archivists in their writings, paintings and sketches but there was no real tourist trade to receive them. The coming of industrialisation in the early 19th century gave rise to a new prosperous middle-class and improved communications; both led to a burgeoning tourist trade. The late 19th century, with improving rail links, saw the coastal areas of Glamorgan that benefited from a beachfront grow as tourist destinations. These towns, most notably Barry Island, Porthcawl, Aberavon and Mumbles, owed their existence as tourist locations to the development of the south Wales coal field and the introduction of the workers&#x27; annual holidays. By the mid 20th century these locations improved the number of visitors they could accommodate with the introduction of caravan parks and chalet parks.

As the 20th century progressed, and people&#x27;s leisure activities extended beyond a once-a-year weeks holiday, the county responded with county parks, museums, art galleries and activity centres.

<text>A bar mitzvah () or bat mitzvah () is a coming of age ritual in Judaism. According to Jewish law, before children reach a certain age, the parents are responsible for their child&#x27;s actions. Once Jewish children reach that age, they are said to &quot;become&quot; &quot;b&#x27;nai mitzvah&quot;, at which point they begin to be held accountable for their own actions. Traditionally, the father of a &quot;bar&quot; or &quot;bat mitzvah&quot; offers thanks to God that he is no longer punished for his child&#x27;s sins.

In Orthodox communities, boys become &quot;bar mitzvah&quot; at 13 and girls become &quot;bat mitzvah&quot; at 12. In most Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative communities, the milestone is 13 regardless of gender. After this point, children are also held responsible for knowing Jewish ritual law, tradition, and ethics, and are able to participate in all areas of Jewish community life to the same extent as adults. In some Jewish communities, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s roles differ in certain respects. For example, in Orthodox Judaism, once a boy turns 13, it is permitted to count him for the purpose of determining whether there is a prayer quorum, and he may lead prayer and other religious services in the family and the community.

&quot;Bar mitzvah&quot; is mentioned in the Mishnah and the Talmud. Some classic sources identify the age at which children must begin to participate in the ritual at the age of 13 for boys and 12 for girls. The age of &quot;b&#x27;nai mitzvah&quot; roughly coincides with the onset of puberty. The &quot;bar&quot;/&quot;bat mitzvah&quot; ceremony is usually held on the first Shabbat after the birthday on which the child reaches the eligible age.

==Etymology==
&quot;Bar&quot; () is a Jewish Babylonian Aramaic word meaning &#x27;son&#x27; (, &quot;ben&quot; in Hebrew), while &quot;bat&quot; (), in Hebrew, means &#x27;daughter&#x27;. &quot;Mitzvah&quot; () is Hebrew for &#x27;commandment&#x27; or &#x27;law&#x27;. Thus, &quot;bar mitzvah&quot; and &quot;bat mitzvah&quot; literally translate to &#x27;son of commandment&#x27; and &#x27;daughter of commandment&#x27;, respectively. However, in rabbinical usage, the word &quot;bar&quot; means &#x27;under the category of&#x27; or &#x27;subject to&#x27;. &quot;Bar mitzvah&quot; therefore translates to &#x27;[one] who is subject to the law&#x27;. Although the term is commonly used to refer to the ritual itself, the phrase originally refers to the person.

== History ==
The modern method of celebrating becoming a &quot;bar mitzvah&quot; did not exist in the time of the Hebrew Bible, Mishnah, or Talmud. Early rabbinic sources specify 13 as the age at which a boy becomes a legal adult; however, the celebration of this occasion is not mentioned until the Middle Ages (from approximately 500 CE to 1500 CE; see Post-classical history).

Some late midrashic sources, and some medieval sources refer to a synagogue ceremony performed upon the boy&#x27;s reaching age thirteen:
* Simon Tzemach Duran quotes a Midrash interpreting the Hebrew word &quot;zo&quot; (&quot;this&quot;) in Isaiah 43:21 (&quot;These people have I formed for myself, they shall speak my praise&quot;) as referring by its numerical value to those that have reached the age of 13. This seems to imply that, at the time of the composition of the Midrash the bar mitzvah publicly pronounced a blessing on the occasion of his entrance upon maturity.
* The Midrash Hashkem: &quot;The heathen when he begets a son consecrates him to idolatrous practices; the Israelite has his son circumcised and the rite of &#x27;pidyon haben&#x27; performed; and as soon as he becomes of age he brings him into the synagogue and school in order that he may praise the name of God, reciting the Barechu.&quot;
* Masseket Soferim (18:5) makes matters even more explicit: &quot;In Jerusalem they are accustomed to initiate their children to fast on the Day of Atonement, a year or two before their maturity; and then, when the age has arrived, to bring the Bar Mitzvah before the priest or elder for blessing, encouragement, and prayer, that he may be granted a portion in the Law and in the doing of good works. Whosoever is of superiority in the town is expected to pray for him as he bows down to him to receive his blessing.&quot;
* Genesis Rabbah: &quot;Up to 13 years Esau and Jacob went together to the primary school and back home; after the thirteen years were over, the one went to the beit midrash to study Law, the other to the house of idols. Regarding this, Rabbi Eleazar remarks, &#x27;Until the 13th year it is the father&#x27;s duty to train his boy; after this, he must say: &quot;Blessed be He who has taken from me the responsibility [the punishment] for this boy!
Later on are references to a festive celebration on this occasion:
* &quot;It is a mitzvah for a person to make a meal on the day his son becomes Bar Mitzvah as on the day he enters the wedding canopy.&quot;

===Age thirteen===
The Bible does not explicitly specify the age of 13. Passages in the books of Exodus and Numbers note the age of majority for army service as twenty. Machzor Vitri notes that refers to Levi as a &quot;man&quot;, when a calculation from other verses suggests that Levi was aged 13 at the time.

The age of thirteen is mentioned in the Mishnah as the time one is obligated to observe the Torah&#x27;s commandments: &quot;At five years old one should study the Scriptures, at ten years for the Mishnah, at 13 for the commandments...&quot;

Elsewhere, the Mishnah lists the ages (13 for boys and 12 for girls) at which a vow is considered automatically valid; the Talmud explains this as a result of the 13-year-old being a &quot;man&quot;, as required in . (For one year before this age, the vows are conditionally valid, depending on whether the boy or girl has signs of physical maturity.)

Other sources also list thirteen as the age of majority with respect to following the commandments of the Torah, including:
* &quot;Why is the evil inclination personified as the great king (Ecclesiastes 9:14)? Because it is thirteen years older than the good inclination.&quot; That is to say, one&#x27;s good inclination begins to act upon reaching the age of majority.
* According to Pirke Rabbi Eli&#x27;ezer 26, Abraham rejected the total idolatry of his father and became a worshiper of God when he was thirteen years old.

===The term &quot;bar mitzvah&quot;===
The term &quot;bar mitzvah&quot; appears first in the Talmud, meaning &quot;one who is subject to the law&quot;, though it does not refer to age. The term &quot;bar mitzvah&quot;, in reference to age, cannot be clearly traced earlier than the 14th century, the older rabbinical term being &quot;gadol&quot; (adult) or &quot;bar &#x27;onshin&quot; (one legally responsible for own misdoings).

== Significance ==
Reaching the age of bar or bat mitzvah signifies becoming a full-fledged member of the Jewish community with the responsibilities that come with it. These include moral responsibility for one&#x27;s own actions; eligibility to be called to read from the Torah and lead or participate in a minyan; the right to possess personal property and to legally marry on one&#x27;s own according to Jewish law; the duty to follow the 613 laws of the Torah and keep the halakha; and the capacity to testify as a witness in a beth din (rabbinical court) case.

Many congregations require pre-bar mitzvah children to attend a minimum number of Shabbat prayer services at the synagogue, study at a Hebrew school, take on a charity or community service project and maintain membership in good standing with the synagogue. In addition to study and preparation offered through the synagogue and Hebrew schools, bar mitzvah tutors may be hired to prepare the child through the study of Hebrew, Torah cantillation and basic Jewish concepts.

According to Rabbi Mark Washofsky, &quot;The Reform Movement in North America has struggled over the bar/bat mitzvah. At one time, this ceremony was on the verge of extinction in Reform congregations. Most of them preferred to replace bar/bat mitzvah with confirmation, which they considered a more enlightened and appropriate ceremony for modern Jews. Yet the enduring popularity of bar/bat mitzvah prevailed and today, in our communities, bar/bat mitzvah is &#x27;virtually universally observed&#x27; by Reform Jews.&quot;

In 2012, concern about the high post-bar/bat mitzvah drop-out rate led the Union for Reform Judaism to launch the B&#x27;nai Mitzvah Revolution, an effort to shift Reform congregations away from &quot;the long-held assumption that religious school is about preparing kids for their bar/bat mitzvah&quot; and focus instead on teaching them how to become committed and involved members of the Jewish community.

== Aliyah to the Torah ==

The widespread practice is that shortly after a boy turns 13, they are called up for an &quot;aliyah,&quot; the ceremony of reading a portion of the Torah section of the day.

On the Sabbath, there are seven main sections, plus an eighth, known as &quot;maftir,&quot; which is also connected to the reading of that day&#x27;s &quot;haftorah&quot; section. It is most common to give the child the &quot;maftir&quot; reading.

In most synagogues, a designated officiant, the &quot;ba&#x27;al korei,&quot; reads all of the Torah portions, and the people receiving each &quot;aliyah&quot; only say the blessings before and after their portion is read. A bar mitzvah boy may learn to act as the &quot;ba&#x27;al korei&quot;, either for the entire service, for just his &quot;aliyah,&quot; or any range in-between. He may also be ba&#x27;al korei for the &quot;haftorah&quot; portion if he receives the &quot;maftir,&quot; or may only be ba&#x27;al korei for the haftorah, without reading from the Torah at all. Any of these undertakings involves a steep learning curve and much practice, possibly taking a year of study, and is an impressive accomplishment.

Girls may have an aliyah in Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative Jewish synagogues. In Orthodox synagogues, aliyot were and typically still are restricted to boys, with a girl potentially giving a d&#x27;var Torah at the end of the service. Some Modern Orthodox girls give aliyot at women&#x27;s services, with fewer than ten men (so as not to constitute a minyan).

In Orthodox circles, the occasion is sometimes celebrated during a weekday service that includes reading from the Torah, such as a Monday or Thursday morning service.

Some communities or families may delay the celebration for reasons such as availability of a Shabbat during which no other celebration has been scheduled, or to allow family members to travel to the event. However, this does not delay the onset of rights and responsibilities of being a Jewish adult which comes about strictly by virtue of age.

== Tefillin ==
The obligation to lay tefillin begins when a boy reaches bar mitzvah age. The common custom is for the bar mitzvah boy to begin putting on tefillin one to three months before his bar mitzvah. This way, by the time he is obligated in the commandment, he will already know how to fulfill it properly.
== Parties ==
As the first mention of a party associated with a synagogue bar mitzvah was in the 13th century, hosting some sort of party is traditional and frequently considered necessary.
Bar mitzvah festivities typically include a joyous seudat mitzvah, a celebratory meal with family, friends, and members of the community, the bar mitzvah boy delivering on this occasion a learned discourse or oration at the table before the invited guests, who offer him presents, while the rabbi or teacher gives him his blessing, accompanying it at times with an address.
Some Jews celebrate in other ways such as taking the bat or bar mitzvah on a special trip or organizing some special event in the celebrant&#x27;s honour. In many communities, the celebrant is given a certificate.

In some times and places, local Jewish leaders have officially limited the size and elaborateness of mitzvahs. For example, only ten men were permitted to attend the party in 1730 in Berlin, and music was banned at these parties in 1767 in Prague. These rules were usually meant to avoid offending non-Jewish neighbours, and to maintain the rule that it be a smaller celebration than a wedding.

Bar and bat mitzvah parties among wealthy Jewish families in North America are often lavish affairs held at hotels and country clubs with hundreds of guests. The trend has been mocked, most notably in the movie &quot;Keeping Up with the Steins&quot;. These lavish parties were also heavily featured in the film &quot;You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah&quot;. In the 1950s, Rabbi Harold Saperstein of New York described them as too often being &quot;more bar than mitzvah&quot;. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach says that over-the-top bar mitzvah parties were already common when he was growing up in Miami in the 1970s.

In 1979, the Responsa Committee of the Central Conference of American Rabbis addressed the Reform attitude toward bat/bar mitzvah: &quot;Every effort should be exerted to maintain the family festivities in the religious mood at the bar/bat mitzvah. Some of the efforts of early Reform in favor of confirmation [and] against bar mitzvah were prompted by the extravagant celebration of bar mitzvah, which had removed its primary religious significance. We vigorously oppose such excesses, as they destroy the meaning of bar/bat mitzvah.&quot;

In May, 1992, the board of trustees of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism), the synagogue arm of the Reform Movement, unanimously passed a resolution decrying &quot;excesses of wasteful consumption...glitzy theme events, sophisticated entertainment...and expensive party favors&quot;, calling instead for &quot;family cohesion, authentic friendship, acts of &quot;tzedakah&quot; (righteous giving), and parties suitable for children.&quot;

The cost of the party depends upon what the family is willing and able to spend. Some families spend tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of dollars on the party. Generally speaking, these celebrations are less costly and elaborate than a wedding in that family. In addition to food and drink for the guests, the money at an elaborate party is mostly spent on renting and decorating a venue and hiring staff, from the catering team to emcees, DJs, entertainers, and dancers (also called &quot;motivators&quot;) to encourage the guests to dance or play games.

== Bat mitzvah customs ==

Today many non-Orthodox Jews celebrate a girl&#x27;s bat mitzvah in the same way as a boy&#x27;s bar mitzvah. All Reform and Reconstructionist, and most Conservative synagogues have egalitarian participation, in which women read from the Torah and lead services. In Orthodox communities, a bat mitzvah is celebrated when a girl reaches the age of 12.

The majority of Orthodox and some Conservative Jews reject the idea that a woman can publicly read from the Torah or lead prayer services whenever there is a minyan (quorum of 10 males) available to do so. However, the public celebration of a girl becoming bat mitzvah in other ways has made strong inroads into Modern Orthodox Judaism and also into some elements of Haredi Judaism. In these congregations, women do not read from the Torah or lead prayer services, but they occasionally lecture on a Jewish topic to mark their coming of age, learn a book of Tanakh, recite verses from the Book of Esther or the Book of Psalms, or say prayers from the siddur. In some Modern Orthodox circles, bat mitzvah girls will read from the Torah and lead prayer services in a women&#x27;s tefillah. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, a prominent Orthodox &quot;posek,&quot; described the bat mitzvah celebration as &quot;meaningless&quot;, and of no greater halakhic significance than a birthday party. However, he reluctantly permitted it in homes, but not synagogues, as the latter would be construed as imitating Reform and Conservative customs; in any case, they do not have the status of seudat mitzvah. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef holds that it is a seudat mitzvah.

There were occasional attempts to recognize a girl&#x27;s coming of age in eastern Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, the former in Warsaw (1843) and the latter in Lemberg (1902). The occasion was marked by a party without any ritual in the synagogue.

There are documents that record an Italian rite for becoming bat mitzvah, known as an &quot;entrance into the minyan&quot; ceremony, in which boys of thirteen and girls of twelve recited a blessing, since the mid-19th century. There were also some bat mitzvah rituals held in the 19th century in Iraq. However, it was the American rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan held the first public celebration of a bat mitzvah as we understand it in modern times for his daughter on March 18, 1922, at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, his synagogue in New York City. Kaplan was unaware of the earlier Italian precedent and learned of them several months later, while on holiday in Italy. Judith Kaplan recited the preliminary blessing, read a portion of that week&#x27;s Torah portion in Hebrew and English, and then intoned the closing blessing. Mordecai Kaplan, an Orthodox rabbi who joined Conservative Judaism and then became the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, influenced Jews from all branches of non-Orthodox Judaism, through his position at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. At the time, most Orthodox rabbis strongly rejected the idea of a bat mitzvah ceremony.

As the ceremony became accepted for females as well as males, many women chose to celebrate the ceremony even though they were much older, as a way of formalizing and celebrating their place in the adult Jewish community.

== Alternative ceremonies ==

Instead of reading from the Torah, some Humanist Jews prefer a research paper on a topic in Jewish history to mark their coming of age. Secular Jewish Sunday schools and communities—including those affiliated with the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations and The Workers Circle—encourage the youngsters to select any topic that interests them and relates to the Jewish part of their identities.

The kibbutz movement in Israel also encouraged the celebration of the bar mitzvah. All those coming of age in the community for that year would take on a project and research in a topic of Jewish or Zionist interest. Today many kibbutz children are opting for a more traditional bar mitzvah celebration.

Among some Jews, a man who has reached the age of 83 will celebrate a second bar mitzvah, under the logic that in the Hebrew Bible it says that a normal lifespan is 70 years, so that an 83-year-old can be considered 13 in a second lifetime. This ritual is becoming more common as people live longer, healthier lives.

A bark mitzvah is a pseudo-traditional observance and celebration of a dog&#x27;s coming of age, as in the Jewish traditional bar and bat mitzvahs. The term has been in use since at least 1958, when Beverly Hills couple Janet and Sonny Salter held a bark mitzvah for their 13 year old dog, Windy. Bark mitzvahs are sometimes held as an adjunct to the festival of Purim.

== Gifts ==
Bar or bat mitzvah celebrations have become an occasion to give the celebrant a commemorative gift. Traditionally, common gifts include books with religious or educational value, religious items, writing implements, savings bonds (to be used for the child&#x27;s college education), gift certificates, or money. Gifts of cash have become commonplace in recent times. As with charity and all other gifts, it has become common to give in multiples of 18, since the &quot;gematria&quot;, or numerical equivalent of the Hebrew word for &quot;life&quot;, (&quot;chai&quot;), is the number 18. Monetary gifts in multiples of 18 are considered to be particularly auspicious and have become common for the bar and bat mitzvah. Many b&#x27;nai mitzvah also receive their first tallit from their parents to be used for the occasion and tefillin where this is appropriate. Jewelry is a common gift for girls at a bat mitzvah celebration. Another gift for the bat mitzvah girl is Shabbat candlesticks because it is the duty and honor of the woman to light the candles.

== In adults ==

While the traditional age to hold a bar or bat mitzvah is 13 for boys and 12 or 13 for girls, some adults choose to have a bar or bat mitzvah if they do not have them as adolescents, alongside the previously mentioned non-traditional ceremony of having a second bar mitzvah when one turns 83.

<doc id="52533" wikidata="Q139350" url="?curid=52533" title="7-Dehydrocholesterol">
<text>7-Dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) is a zoosterol that functions in the serum as a cholesterol precursor, and is photochemically converted to vitamin D3 in the skin, therefore functioning as provitamin-D3. The presence of this compound in human skin enables humans to manufacture vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Upon exposure to ultraviolet UV-B rays in the sun light, 7-DHC is converted into vitamin D3 via previtamin D3 as an intermediate isomer. It is also found in the milk of several mammalian species. Lanolin, a waxy substance that is naturally secreted by wool-bearing mammals, contains 7-DHC which is converted into vitamin D by sunlight and then ingested during grooming as a nutrient. In insects 7-dehydrocholesterol is a precursor for the hormone ecdysone, required for reaching adulthood. 7-DHC was discovered by Nobel-laureate organic chemist Adolf Windaus.

It is synthesized from lathosterol by the enzyme lathosterol oxidase (lathosterol 5-desaturase). This is the next-to-last step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Defective synthesis results in the human inherited disorder lathosterolosis resembling Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome. Mice where this gene has been deleted lose the ability to increase vitamin D3 in the blood following UV exposure of the skin.

==Location ==
The skin consists of two primary layers: an inner layer, the dermis, comprising largely connective tissue, and an outer, thinner epidermis. The thickness of the epidermis ranges from 0.04 mm to greater than 0.6 mm. The epidermis comprises five &quot;strata&quot;; from outer to inner, they are the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. The highest concentrations of 7-dehydrocholesterol are found in the epidermal layer of skin—specifically in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum. The production of pre-vitamin D3 is, therefore, greatest in these two layers.

==Radiation==
Synthesis of pre-vitamin D3 in the skin involves UVB radiation, which effectively penetrates only the epidermal layers of skin. 7-Dehydrocholesterol absorbs UV light most effectively at wavelengths between 295 and 300 nm and, thus, the production of vitamin D3 will occur primarily at those wavelengths. The two most important factors that govern the generation of pre-vitamin D3 are the quantity (intensity) and quality (appropriate wavelength) of the UVB irradiation reaching the 7-dehydrocholesterol deep in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be used to produce the radiation.

Another important consideration is the quantity of 7-dehydrocholesterol present in the skin. Under normal circumstances, ample quantities of 7-dehydrocholesterol (about 25–50 μg/cm2 of skin) are available in the stratum spinosum and stratum basale of human skin to meet the body&#x27;s vitamin D requirements. 7-DHC insufficiency has been proposed as an alternate cause for Vitamin D deficiency.

== Sources ==
7-DHC can be produced by animals and plants via different pathways. It is not produced by fungi in significant amounts. It is made by some algae, but the pathway is poorly understood.

Industrially, 7-DHC generally comes from lanolin, and is used to produce vitamin D3 by UV exposure. Lichen (Cladonia rangiferina) is used to produce vegan D3.

7-DHC is used for vitamin D3 synthesis via lanosterol in land animals, via cycloartenol in plants, and in algae together with another provitamin D ergosterol for D2. In fungi solely ergosterol is used for synthesis of D2 via lanosterol.

<doc id="52534" wikidata="Q2045366" url="?curid=52534" title="Axiom of empty set">
<text>In axiomatic set theory, the axiom of empty set, also called the axiom of null set and the axiom of existence, is a statement that asserts the existence of a set with no elements. It is an axiom of Kripke–Platek set theory and the variant of general set theory that Burgess (2005) calls &quot;ST,&quot; and a demonstrable truth in Zermelo set theory and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, with or without the axiom of choice.

== Formal statement ==
In the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads:
:formula_1.
Or, alternatively, formula_2.

In words:
:There is a set such that no element is a member of it.

== Interpretation ==

We can use the axiom of extensionality to show that there is only one empty set. Since it is unique we can name it. It is called the &quot;empty set&quot; (denoted by { } or ∅). The axiom, stated in natural language, is in essence:
:&quot;An empty set exists&quot;.

This formula is a theorem and considered true in every version of set theory. The only controversy is over how it should be justified: by making it an axiom; by deriving it from a set-existence axiom (or logic) and the axiom of separation; by deriving it from the axiom of infinity; or some other method.

In some formulations of ZF, the axiom of empty set is actually repeated in the axiom of infinity. However, there are other formulations of that axiom that do not presuppose the existence of an empty set. The ZF axioms can also be written using a constant symbol representing the empty set; then the axiom of infinity uses this symbol without requiring it to be empty, while the axiom of empty set is needed to state that it is in fact empty.

Furthermore, one sometimes considers set theories in which there are no infinite sets, and then the axiom of empty set may still be required. However, any axiom of set theory or logic that implies the existence of any set will imply the existence of the empty set, if one has the axiom schema of separation. This is true, since the empty set is a subset of any set consisting of those elements that satisfy a contradictory formula.

In many formulations of first-order predicate logic, the existence of at least one object is always guaranteed. If the axiomatization of set theory is formulated in such a logical system with the axiom schema of separation as axioms, and if the theory makes no distinction between sets and other kinds of objects (which holds for ZF, KP, and similar theories), then the existence of the empty set is a theorem.

If separation is not postulated as an axiom schema, but derived as a theorem schema from the schema of replacement (as is sometimes done), the situation is more complicated, and depends on the exact formulation of the replacement schema. The formulation used in the axiom schema of replacement article only allows to construct the image &quot;F&quot;[&quot;a&quot;] when &quot;a&quot; is contained in the domain of the class function &quot;F&quot;; then the derivation of separation requires the axiom of empty set. On the other hand, the constraint of totality of &quot;F&quot; is often dropped from the replacement schema, in which case it implies the separation schema without using the axiom of empty set (or any other axiom for that matter).

<text>The Nationalist Party, also known as the National Party, was an Australian political party. It was formed in February 1917 from a merger between the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party, the latter formed by Prime Minister Billy Hughes and his supporters after the 1916 Labor Party split over World War I conscription. The Nationalist Party was established as a &#x27;united&#x27; non-Labor opposition that had remained a political trend once the Labor party established itself in federal politics. The party was in government (from 1923 in coalition with the Country Party) until electoral defeat in 1929. From that time it was the main opposition to the Labor Party until it merged with pro-Joseph Lyons Labor defectors to form the United Australia Party (UAP) in 1931. The party is a direct ancestor of the Liberal Party of Australia, the main centre-right party in Australia.

==History==
In October 1915, the Australian prime minister, Andrew Fisher of the Australian Labor Party, retired; Billy Hughes was chosen unanimously by the Labor caucus to succeed him. Hughes was a strong supporter of Australia&#x27;s participation in World War I, and after a visit to Britain in 1916, where the Military Service Act 1916 had been passed earlier in the year, he became convinced that conscription was necessary if Australia was to sustain its contribution to the war effort. A majority of his party, most notably Roman Catholics and trade union representatives, was opposed to this, especially given the British government&#x27;s reprisals against the Irish Easter Rising of 1916.

In October, Hughes held a plebiscite to try to gain approval for conscription, but the proposition was narrowly defeated. Daniel Mannix, the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, was his main opponent on the conscription issue. The defeat did not deter Hughes, who continued to vigorously argue in favour of conscription. This produced a deep and bitter split within the Australian public, as well as within his own party. The extent to which he engineered this split has been hotly debated ever since, and was even at the time regarded as ironic by many in the Labor movement, given Hughes&#x27; violent hostility to earlier Labor dissidents like Joseph Cook.

On 15 September 1916, the New South Wales executive of the Political Labour League (the Labor Party organisation at the time) expelled Hughes from the Labor Party. When the parliamentary Labor caucus met on 14 November 1916, lengthy discussions took place until Hughes walked out with 24 other Labor members. The remaining 43 members of the caucus then passed a motion of no confidence in the leadership, effectively expelling Hughes and his allies.

Hughes and his followers rebranded themselves as the &quot;National Labor Party&quot;, and continued in office as a minority government with support from Cook and his Commonwealth Liberal Party. With the war dragging on, Hughes began negotiations with Cook to turn their confidence-and-supply agreement into formal party unity. That February, at the urging of the governor-general, Sir Robert Munro Ferguson, the two groups formally merged to form the Nationalist Party, with Hughes as leader and Cook as deputy leader. The new party was dominated by former Liberals, and as such was basically an upper- and middle-class party. However, the presence of many former Labor men—many of whom had been early leaders in that party—allowed the Nationalists to project an image of national unity.

In May 1917, the Nationalists won a huge electoral victory, and formed what was at the time the biggest majority government since Federation. The size of the landslide was magnified by the large number of Labor MPs who followed Hughes into the Nationalist Party. At this election Hughes abandoned his working-class division of West Sydney, and was elected for Bendigo in Victoria. He had promised to resign if his Government did not win the power to conscript. A second plebiscite on conscription was held in December 1917, but the proposition was again defeated, this time by a wider margin. Hughes, after receiving a vote of no confidence in his leadership by his party, resigned as prime minister. However, with no alternative candidates available, Ferguson used his reserve power to immediately re-commission Hughes as prime minister. Hughes was thus able to remain in office while having kept his promise to resign.

Hughes and the Nationalists were reelected almost as easily in 1919. They governed on their own until the elections of 1922, when the newly emerged Country Party gained the balance of power in the House of Representatives. The Nationalists had come up 12 seats short of a majority, and could only realistically hope for support from the Country Party. It was obvious that a confidence-and-supply agreement would not be enough to keep the Nationalists in office. However, the Country Party had never liked Hughes&#x27; rural policy, and its leader Earle Page let it be known that he would not serve under him. Several of the more conservative elements of the Nationalist Party had only tolerated Hughes after the war, suspecting he was still a socialist at heart. Page&#x27;s demand finally gave them an excuse to dump Hughes, who was forced to resign in January 1923. Former treasurer Stanley Bruce was chosen as leader, and quickly entered into a coalition with the Country Party. The price, however, was high: five seats for the Country Party in cabinet (out of 11), with Page as treasurer and number-two man in the government. Such demands were unheard of for such a young party in a Westminster system. However, Bruce agreed to the terms rather than force another election. This was the start of the traditional coalition of non-Labor parties.

With the ouster of Hughes, the Nationalists took on a decidedly more conservative hue. Despite initial concerns that Australians wouldn&#x27;t readily support the aloof Bruce, the Nationalist-Country Coalition won a great victory in the federal election of 1925. It was re-elected in 1928, though with a significantly reduced mandate. However, only a year later, Hughes led a group of backbenchers to cross the floor on a vote on Bruce&#x27;s plans to reform the industrial arbitration system. In the subsequent election the Coalition was heavily defeated, suffering what was at the time the second-worst defeat of a sitting government since federation. Bruce even lost his own seat, and was succeeded as leader by former attorney-general John Latham.

The Nationalists were never a real force in Australian politics again. The party had spent its entire 12-year existence in government, and was ill-prepared for a role in opposition. In 1931, following negotiations with a group of Labor Party defectors led by Joseph Lyons, the Nationalist Party was absorbed into the new United Australia Party. Although the UAP was dominated by former Nationalists, Lyons was chosen as leader rather than Latham. The UAP replaced the Nationalists as the main non-Labor party.

The Western Australian branch retained the Nationalist name after the formation of the UAP, and did so until it and most of the major non-Labor parties were folded into the present-day Liberal Party of Australia.

==Young Nationalists Organisation==
Around 1929, Robert Menzies, then a member of the Victorian Legislative Council, joined with Wilfrid Kent Hughes to form the Young Nationalists Organisation. Menzies was its first president.

The organisation kept its name when its parent party became part of the UAP. Half of the UAP members elected in the 1932 Victorian state election were Young Nationalists, almost trebling their parliamentary representation. The premier, Sir Stanley Argyle, included three of them in his eight-person cabinet, including Menzies as deputy premier.

Later, when Menzies founded the Liberal Party of Australia, he invited delegates from the Young Nationalists to attend. The Young Nationalists followed the UAP into the Liberal Party, and formed the nucleus of the new party&#x27;s youth wing, the Young Liberals.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* Consuls: Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus.
* Consuls Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus pass the Lex Trebonia.
* Pompey&#x27;s Theater, the first permanent (non-wooden) theatre in Rome is built. Built of stone on the Field of Mars, it included a temple to Venus Victorious, a public courtyard, and a meeting hall or &quot;curia&quot; in the far end near the &quot;Sacred Area&quot;.
* Fourth year of Julius Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars:
** Spring – Julius Caesar starts the season campaigning in Illyricum (in the Balkan region) against the Pirustae, who have been raiding Roman territory.
** Summer – Julius Caesar defeats the Usipetes and the Tencteri, two Germanic tribes who have been driven across the Rhine River by the Suebi. He spreads Roman law and order, and makes the whole country as far as the Channel accessible to trade.
** May – Julius Caesar defeats a Germanic army then massacres the women and children, totalling 430,000 people, near the Meuse and Rhine Rivers (now known as the city of Kessel in the Netherlands).
** June – Julius Caesar crosses the Rhine River near modern-day Koblenz. He constructs a wooden bridge between Andernach and Neuwied (Germany).

==== Britain ====
* August 22 or August 26 – Julius Caesar commands his first invasions of Britain, likely a reconnaissance-in-force expedition, in response to the Britons giving military aid to his Gallic enemies. Caesar retreats back to Gaul when the majority of his force is prevented from landing by storms.

<text>Melanocytes are melanin-producing neural crest-derived cells located in the bottom layer (the stratum basale) of the skin&#x27;s epidermis, the middle layer of the eye (the uvea), the inner ear, vaginal epithelium, meninges, bones, and heart found in many mammals and birds. Melanin is a dark pigment primarily responsible for skin color. Once synthesized, melanin is contained in special organelles called melanosomes which can be transported to nearby keratinocytes to induce pigmentation. Thus darker skin tones have more melanosomes present than lighter skin tones. Functionally, melanin serves as protection against UV radiation. Melanocytes also have a role in the immune system.

== Function ==
Through a process called melanogenesis, melanocytes produce melanin, which is a pigment found in the skin, eyes, hair, nasal cavity, and inner ear. This melanogenesis leads to a long-lasting pigmentation, which is in contrast to the pigmentation that originates from oxidation of already-existing melanin.

There are both basal and activated levels of melanogenesis; in general, lighter-skinned people have low basal levels of melanogenesis. Exposure to UV-B radiation causes increased melanogenesis. The purpose of melanogenesis is to protect the hypodermis, the layer under the skin, from damage by UV radiation. The color of the melanin is black, allowing it to absorb a majority of the UV light and block it from passing through the epidermis.

Since the action spectrum of sunburn and melanogenesis are virtually identical, they are assumed to be induced by the same mechanism. The agreement of the action spectrum with the absorption spectrum of DNA points towards the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) - direct DNA damage.

Typically, between 1000 and 2000 melanocytes are found per square millimeter of skin or approximately 5% to 10% of the cells in the basal layer of epidermis. Although their size can vary, melanocytes are typically 7 μm in length.

Both lightly and darkly pigmented skin contain similar numbers of melanocytes, with difference in skin color due to differences the packing of eumelanin into the melanosomes of keratinocytes: those in dark-toned skin are &quot;packaged into peri-nuclear distributed, ellipsoid&quot; melanosomes while those light-tone skin are &quot;assembled into clustered small, circular melanosomes&quot;. There are also differences in the quantity and relative amounts of eumelanin and pheomelanin. Pigmentation including tanning is under hormonal control, including the MSH and ACTH peptides that are produced from the precursor proopiomelanocortin.

Vitiligo is a skin disease where people lack melanin in certain areas in the skin.

People with oculocutaneous albinism typically have a very low level of melanin production. Albinism is often but not always related to the &quot;TYR&quot; gene coding the tyrosinase enzyme. Tyrosinase is required for melanocytes to produce melanin from the amino acid tyrosine. Albinism may be caused by a number of other genes as well, like &quot;OCA2&quot;, &quot;SLC45A2&quot;, &quot;TYRP1&quot;, and &quot;HPS1&quot; to name some. In all, already 17 types of oculocutaneous albinism have been recognized. Each gene is related to different protein having a role in pigment production.

People with Chédiak–Higashi syndrome have a buildup of melanin granules due to abnormal function of microtubules.

== Role in the immune system ==
In addition to their role as UV radical scavengers, melanocytes are also part of the immune system, and are considered to be immune cells. Although the full role of melanocytes in immune response is not fully understood, melanocytes share many characteristics with dendritic cells: branched morphology; phagocytic capabilities; presentation of antigens to T-cells; and production and release of cytokines. Although melanocytes are dendritic in form and share many characteristics with dendritic cells, they derive from different cell lineages. Dendritic cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Melanocytes on the other hand originate from neural crest cells. As such, although morphologically and functionally similar, melanocytes and dendritic cells are not the same.

Melanocytes are capable of expressing MHC Class II, a type of MHC expressed only by certain antigen presenting cells of the immune system, when stimulated by interactions with antigen or cytokines. All cells in any given vertebrate express MHC, but most cells only express MHC class I. The other class of MHC, Class II, is found only on &quot;professional&quot; antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, and melanocytes. Importantly, melanocytes stimulated by cytokines express surface proteins such as CD40 and ICAM1 in addition to MHC class II, allowing for co-stimulation of T cells.

In addition to presenting antigen, one of the roles of melanocytes in the immune response is cytokine production. Melanocytes express many proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and TGF-β. Like other immune cells, melanocytes secrete these cytokines in response to activation of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) such as Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) which recognize MAMPs. MAMPs, also known as PAMPs, are microbial associated molecular patterns, small molecular elements such as proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids present on or in a given pathogen. In addition, cytokine production by melanocytes can be triggered by cytokines secreted by other nearby immune cells.

Melanocytes are ideally positioned in the epidermis to be sentinels against harmful pathogens. They reside in the stratum basale, the lowest layer of the epidermis, but they use their dendrites to interact with cells in other layers, and to capture pathogens that enter the epidermis. They likely work in concert with both keratinocytes and Langerhans cells, both of which are also actively phagocytic, to contribute to the immune response.

=== Melanogenesis ===
Tyrosine is the non-essential amino acid precursor of melanin. Tyrosine is converted to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) via the enzyme tyrosinase. Then DOPA is polymerized into melanin. The copper-ion based enzyme-catalyzed oxidative transformation of catechol derivative dopa to light absorbing
dopaquinone to indole-5,6-quinone is clearly seen following the polymerization to melanin, the color of the pigment ranges from red to dark brown.

====Stimulation====

Numerous stimuli are able to alter melanogenesis, or the production of melanin by cultured melanocytes, although the method by which it works is not fully understood. Increased melanin production is seen in conditions where adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is elevated, such as Addison&#x27;s and Cushing&#x27;s disease. This is mainly a consequence of alpha-MSH being secreted along with the hormone associated with reproductive tendencies in primates. Alpha-MSH is a cleavage product of ACTH that has an equal affinity for the MC1 receptor on melanocytes as ACTH.

Melanosomes are vesicles that package the chemical inside a plasma membrane. The melanosomes are organized as a cap protecting the nucleus of the keratinocyte. When ultraviolet rays penetrate the skin and damage DNA, thymidine dinucleotide (pTpT) fragments from damaged DNA will trigger melanogenesis and cause the melanocyte to produce melanosomes, which are then transferred by dendrites to the top layer of keratinocytes.

=== Stem cells ===
The precursor of the melanocyte is the melanoblast. In adults, stem cells are contained in the bulge area of the outer root sheath of hair follicles. When a hair is lost and the hair follicle regenerates, the stem cells are activated. These stem cells develop into both keratinocyte precursors and melanoblasts - and these melanoblasts supply both hair and skin (moving into the basal layer of the epidermis). There is additionally evidence that melanocyte stem cells are present in cutaneous nerves, with nerve signals causing these cells to differentiate into melanocytes for the skin.

<doc id="52544" wikidata="Q171834" url="?curid=52544" title="Aldo Moro">
<text>Aldo Moro (; 23 September 1916 – 9 May 1978) was an Italian statesman and prominent member of Christian Democracy (DC) and its centre-left wing. He served as prime minister of Italy in five terms from December 1963 to June 1968 and from November 1974 to July 1976.

Moro served as Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs from May 1969 to July 1972 and again from July 1973 to November 1974. During his ministry, he implemented a pro-Arab policy. Moreover, he was appointed Italy&#x27;s Minister of Justice and of Public Education during the 1950s. From March 1959 until January 1964, he served as secretary of the DC. On 16 March 1978, he was kidnapped by the far-left terrorist group Red Brigades; he was killed after 55 days of captivity.

Moro was one of Italy&#x27;s longest-serving post-war prime ministers, leading the country for more than six years. Moro implemented a series of social and economic reforms that modernized the country. Due to his accommodation with the Italian Communist Party leader Enrico Berlinguer, known as the Historic Compromise, Moro is widely considered to be one of the most prominent fathers of the modern Italian centre-left.

== Early life ==
Aldo Romeo Luigi Moro was born on 23 September 1916 in Maglie, near Lecce, into a family from Ugento in the Apulia region of the Kingdom of Italy. His father, Renato Moro, was a school inspector, while his mother, Fida Sticchi, was a teacher. At the age of 4, he moved with his family to Milan; they soon moved back to Apulia, where he gained a classical high school degree at Archita lyceum in Taranto. In 1934, his family moved to Bari. There, he studied law at the University of Bari and graduated in 1939. After graduation, he became a professor of philosophy of law and colonial policy (1941) and of criminal law (1942) at the University of Bari.

In 1935, Moro joined the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students (FUCI) of Bari. In 1939, under the approval of Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, whom he had befriended, Moro was chosen as president of the association. He kept the post until 1942 when he was forced to fight in World War II and was succeeded by Giulio Andreotti, who at the time was a law student from Rome. During his university years, Italy was ruled by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, and Moro took part in students competitions known as Lictors of Culture and Art organized by the local fascist students&#x27; organization, the University Fascist Groups. In 1943, along with other Catholic students, he founded the periodical &quot;La Rassegna&quot;, which was published until 1945.

In July 1943, Moro contributed, along with Andreotti, Mario Ferrari Aggradi, Paolo Emilio Taviani, Guido Gonella, Giuseppe Capogrossi, Ferruccio Pergolesi, Vittore Branca, Giorgio La Pira, and Giuseppe Medici, to the creation of the Code of Camaldoli, a document planning of economic policy drawn up by members of the Italian Catholic forces. It served as inspiration and guideline for economic policy of the future Christian democrats. In 1945, he married Eleonora Chiavarelli (1915–2010), with whom he had four children: Maria Fida (born 1946), Anna (born 1949), Agnese (born 1952), and Giovanni (born 1958). In 1963, Moro was transferred to La Sapienza University of Rome as a professor of the institutions of law and criminal procedure.

== Early political career ==
Moro developed his interest in politics between 1943 and 1945. Initially, he seemed to be very interested in the social-democratic component of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) but then started cooperating with other Christian-democratic politicians in opposition to the Italian fascist regime. During these years, he met Alcide De Gasperi, Mario Scelba, Giovanni Gronchi, and Amintore Fanfani. On 19 March 1943, the group reunited in the house of Giuseppe Spataro and officially formed the Christian Democracy (DC) party. In the DC, he joined the left-wing faction led by Giuseppe Dossetti, of whom he became a close ally. In 1945, he became director of the magazine &quot;Studium&quot; and president of the Graduated Movement of Catholic Action (&quot;Azione Cattolica&quot;, AC), a widespread Catholic lay association.

After being appointed vice-president of the DC, Moro was elected in the 1946 Italian general election a member of the Constituent Assembly of Italy, where he took part in the work to redact the Italian Constitution. It was during this period that his relations with the Italian Socialist Democratic Party (PSDI) and Italian social-democrats began. In 1946, Moro ran for the Bari–Foggia constituency, where he received nearly 28,000 votes. In the 1948 Italian general election, he was elected with 63,000 votes to the newly formed Chamber of Deputies, and was appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in the fifth De Gasperi government from 23 May 1948 to 27 January 1950. After Dossetti&#x27;s retirement in 1952, Moro founded, along with Antonio Segni, Emilio Colombo, and Mariano Rumor, the Democratic Initiative faction, which was led by his old friend Fanfani.

== In government ==

In the 1953 Italian general election, Moro was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where he held the position of chairman of the DC parliamentary group. In 1955, was appointed as Italian Minister of Grace and Justice in the first Segni government led by Segni as Prime Minister of Italy. In 1956, he was among the most popular candidates, receiving the most votes during the party&#x27;s congress. In May 1957, the PSDI withdrew its support to the government and Segni resigned on 6 May 1957.

On 20 May 1957, Adone Zoli was sworn in as the new head of government and Moro was appointed Italian Minister of Education. After the 1958 Italian general election, Zoli resigned. On 1 July 1958, Fanfani was sworn in as the new prime minister at the head of a coalition government with the PSDI and case-by-case support by the Italian Republican Party (PRI). Moro was confirmed as the head of Italian education and remained in office until February 1959. During his tenure, he introduced the study of civic education in schools.

In March 1959, after Fanfani&#x27;s resignation as prime minister, a new congress was called. The leaders of the Democratic Initiative faction reunited themselves in the Convent of Dorothea of Caesarea, where they abandoned the leftist policies promoted by Fanfani and founded the &quot;Dorotei&quot; (Dorotheans) faction. In the party&#x27;s national council, Moro was elected secretary of the DC and was then confirmed in the October&#x27;s congress held in Florence. After the brief right-wing government led by Fernando Tambroni in 1960, supported by the decisive votes of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI), the renovated alliance between Moro as secretary and Fanfani as prime minister led the subsequent National Congress, held in Naples in 1962, to approve with a large majority a line of collaboration with the Italian Socialist Party (PSI).

The 1963 Italian general election was characterized by a lack of consensus for the DC; in fact, the election was held after the launch of the centre-left formula by the DC, a coalition based upon the alliance with the PSI, which had left their alignment with the Soviet Union. Some rightist electors abandoned the DC for the Italian Liberal Party (PLI), which was asking for a centre-right government and received votes also from the quarrelsome monarchist area. Moro refused the office of prime minister, preferring to provisionally maintain his more influential post at the head of the party. Initially, the DC decided to replace Fanfani with a provisional administration led by an impartial president of the Chamber of Deputies, Giovanni Leone. When the congress of the PSI in autumn authorized a full engagement of the party into the government, Leone resigned and Moro became the new prime minister.

== First term as prime minister ==

Moro&#x27;s first government was unevenly supported by the DC but also by the PCI, along with the PSDI and the Italian Republican Party (PRI). The coalition, which replaced the previous Centrism system, was known as the Organic centre-left and was characterized by consociationalist and social corporatist tendencies.

=== Social reforms ===
During Moro&#x27;s premiership, a wide range of social reforms was carried out. The 1967 Bridge Law (&quot;Legge Ponte&quot;) introduced urgent housing provisions as part of an envisioned reform of the entire sector, such as the introduction of minimum standards for housing and the environment. A reform, which was promulgated on 14 December 1963, introduced an annual allowance for university students with income below a given level. Another law, which was promulgated on 10 March 1968, introduced voluntary public pre-elementary education for children aged three to five years. A bill approved on 21 July 1965 extended the program of social security.

Despite mistrust and opposition, particularly when the Italian economic miracle came to an end and the government had to control the rise of inflation, the reforms continued. The legal minimum wage was raised, all then-current pensions were revalued, seniority pensions were introduced (after 35 years of contributions workers could retire even before attaining pensionable age), and within the National Institute for Social Security (INPS), a social fund (&quot;fondo sociale&quot;) was established, ensuring to all members pensioners a basic uniform pension largely financed by the state, known as the social pension. A law, which was approved on 22 July 1966, extended social security insurance to small traders, while the law of 22 July 1966 extended health insurance to retired traders. Another important reform was implemented with a bill that was approved on 29 May 1967. It extended compulsory health insurance to retired farmers, tenant farmers, and sharecroppers, and extended health insurance to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits. Moreover, a law of 5 November 1968 extended family allowances to the unemployed who received unemployment benefits.

=== Vajont Dam disaster ===

During his premiership, Moro had to face the outcome of one of the most tragic events in Italian republican history, the Vajont Dam disaster. On 9 October 1963, a few weeks before his oath as prime minister, a landslide occurred on Monte Toc, in the province of Pordenone. The landslide caused a megatsunami in the artificial lake in which 50 million cubic metres of water overtopped the dam in a wave of , leading to the complete destruction of several villages and towns, and 1,917 deaths. In the previous months, the Adriatic Society of Electricity (SADE) and the Italian government, which both owned the dam, dismissed evidence and concealed reports describing the geological instability of Monte Toc on the southern side of the basin and other early warning signs reported prior to the disaster.

Immediately after the disaster, government and local authorities insisted on attributing the tragedy to an unexpected and unavoidable natural event. Numerous warnings, signs of danger, and negative appraisals had been disregarded in the previous months and the eventual attempt to safely control the landslide into the lake by lowering its level came when the landslide was almost imminent and was too late to prevent it. The PCI newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Unità&quot; was the first to denounce the actions of management and government. The DC accused the PCI of political profiteering from the tragedy, promising to bring justice to the people killed in the disaster.

Differently from Leone, who was his predecessor and became the head of SADE&#x27;s team of lawyers, Moro acted strongly to condemn the managers of the society. He immediately dismissed the administrative officials who had supervised the construction of the dam.

=== Coalition crisis and presidential election ===

On 25 June 1964, the government was beaten on the budget law for the Italian Ministry of Education concerning the financing of private education. On the same day, Moro resigned. During the presidential consultations for the formation of a new cabinet, Segni, the then moderate DC member and president of Italy, asked the PSI leader Pietro Nenni to exit from the government majority.

On 16 July 1964, Segni sent the &quot;Carabinieri&quot; general Giovanni de Lorenzo to a meeting of representatives of DC, in order to deliver a message in case the negotiations around the formation of a new centre-left government would fail. According to some historians, De Lorenzo reported that Segni was ready to give a subsequent mandate to the president of the Senate of the Republic, Cesare Merzagora, and would ask him to form a president&#x27;s government composed by all the conservative forces in the Italian Parliament. This attempted coup, which came to be known as the &quot;Piano Solo&quot;, only became public in 1967 through the investigative reporting of &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot;. Ultimately, Moro managed to form another centre-left majority. During the negotiations, Nenni had accepted the downsizing of his reform programs. On 17 July 1964, Moro went to the Quirinal Palace, with the acceptance of the assignment and the list of ministers of his second government.

In August 1964, Segni had a serious cerebral haemorrhage and resigned after a few months. In the 1964 Italian presidential election, which was held in December, Moro and his majority tried to elect a leftist politician at the Quirinal Palace. On the twenty-first round of voting, the leader of the PSDI and former president of the Constituent Assembly, Giuseppe Saragat, was elected with 646 votes out of 963. Saragat was the first left-wing politician to become president of Italy.

=== Resignation ===
Despite the opposition by Segni and other prominent rightist members of the DC, the centre-left coalition, the first one for the Italian post-war political life, stayed in power for nearly five years until the 1968 Italian general election, which was characterized by a defeat for DC&#x27;s centre-left allies. The PSI and PSDI ran in a joint list named Unified Socialist Party (PSU), which lost many votes compared to the previous election, while the PCI gained ground, achieving 30% of votes in the Senate. The PSI and PSDI decided to exit from the government and Saragat appointed Leone at the head of the new cabinet composed only by DC members.

== Minister of Foreign Affairs ==

In the 1968 DC congress, Moro yielded the secretariat and passed to internal opposition. On 5 August 1969, he was appointed Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs by the then prime minister Mariano Rumor, a position that he also held under the premierships of Emilio Colombo and Giulio Andreotti.

=== Pro-Arab policies ===
During his ministry, Moro continued the pro-Arab policy of his predecessor Fanfani. He forced Yasser Arafat to promise not to carry out terrorist attacks in Italian territory, with a commitment that was known as the Moro pact (&quot;lodo Moro&quot;). The existence of this pact and its validity was confirmed by Bassam Abu Sharif, a long-time leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). Interviewed by Italian newspapers, such as &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; and &quot;La Stampa&quot;, he confirmed the existence of an agreement between Italy and the PFLP, thanks to which the PFLP could &quot;transport weapons and explosives, guaranteeing immunity from attacks in return&quot;.

About the pact, Abu Sharif commented: &quot;I personally followed the negotiations for the agreement. Aldo Moro was a great man, a true patriot, who wanted to save Italy some headaches, but I never met him. We discussed the details with an admiral and agents of the Italian secret service. The agreement was defined and since then we have always respected it; we were allowed to organize small transits, passages, and purely Palestinian operations, without involving Italians. After the deal, every time I came to Rome, two cars were waiting for me to protect myself. For our part, we also guaranteed to avoid embarrassment to your country, that is attacks which started directly from the Italian soil.&quot; This version was confirmed by former president Francesco Cossiga, who stated that Moro was the real and only creator of the pact. Moro also had to cope with the difficult situation which erupted following the coup by Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, a very important country for Italian interests not only for colonial ties but also for its energy resources and the presence of about 20,000 Italians.

=== 1971 presidential election ===
In the 1971 Italian presidential election, Fanfani was proposed as the DC candidate for the office. His candidacy was weakened by the divisions within his own party and the candidacy of the PSI member Francesco De Martino, who received votes from PCI, PSI, and some PSDI members. Fanfani retired after several unsuccessful ballots and Moro was then proposed as a candidate by the left-wing faction. The right-wing strongly opposed him and the moderate conservative Leone was slightly preferred to him. At the twenty-third round, Leone was finally elected with a centre-right majority, with 518 votes out of 996, including those of the MSI.

=== Italicus Express bombing ===
On 4 August 1974, a bomb exploded on the Italicus Express, killing 12 people and injuring 48. The train was travelling from Rome to Munich; having left Florence about 45 minutes earlier, it was approaching the end of the long San Benedetto Val di Sambro tunnel under the Apennines. The bomb had been placed in the fifth passenger carriage and exploded at 01:23, while the train was reaching the end of the tunnel. The effects of the explosion and subsequent fire would have been even more terrible if the train had remained inside the tunnel. According to what his daughter Maria Fida stated in 2004, Moro should have been on board. A few minutes before departure, he was joined by some officials of the ministry who made him get off to sign some important documents. According to some reconstructions, Moro would have been the real target of the Italicus Express bombing.

== Second term as prime minister ==
In October 1974, Rumor resigned as prime minister after failing to come to an agreement on how to deal with rising economic inflation. In November, Leone gave Moro the task of forming a new cabinet; he was sworn in on 23 November 1974, at the head a cabinet composed by DC and PRI, and externally supported by PSI and PSDI.

During Moro&#x27;s second term as prime minister, the government implemented a series of other important social reforms. A law, which was approved on 9 June 1975, increased the number of occupational diseases and extended the duration of linked insurance and benefit; while a bill, approved on 3 June 1975, introduced various improvements for pensioners. Moreover, the multiplying coefficient was raised to 2% and it was applied to average earnings of the best three years in the last ten years of work and automatic annual adjustment of minimum pensions. A law of 27 December 1975 implemented &quot;ad hoc&quot; upgradings of cash benefits for certain diseases.

=== Osimo Treaty ===

During his premiership, Moro signed the Osimo Treaty with the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, defining the official partition of the Free Territory of Trieste. The port city of Trieste with a narrow coastal strip to the northwest (Zone A) was given to Italy, while a portion of the north-western part of the Istrian peninsula (Zone B) was given to Yugoslavia. The Italian government was harshly criticized for signing the treaty, particularly for the secretive way in which negotiations were carried out, skipping the traditional diplomatic channels. Since Istria had been an ancient Italian region, dating back to Roman Italy, together with the Venetian region of the Roman Empire, as &quot;Venetia et Histria&quot;, Italian nationalists of the MSI rejected the idea of giving it up.

Between World War I and the end of World War II, Istria had belonged to Italy for twenty-five years, and the west coast of Istria had long had a sizeable Italian minority population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valussi/Ressmann&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some nationalist politicians called for the prosecution of Moro and Rumor, his long-time friend who was the then foreign affairs minister, for the crime of treason, as stated in Article 241 of the Italian Criminal Code, which mandated a life sentence for anybody found guilty of aiding and abetting a foreign power to exert its sovereignty on the national territory.

=== Resignation ===
Despite the tensions within the government&#x27;s majority, the close relations between Moro and the PCI leader Enrico Berlinguer guaranteed a certain stability to Moro&#x27;s governments, allowing them a capacity to act that went beyond the premises that had seen them born. The fourth Moro government, with Ugo La Malfa as Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, started the first dialogue with the PCI, with the aim of beginning a new phase to strengthen the Italian democratic system. In 1976, the PSI secretary Francesco De Martino withdrew the external support to the government and Moro was forced to resign.

== Historic compromise ==
After the 1976 Italian general election, the PCI gained a historic 34% votes and Moro became a vocal supporter of the necessity of starting a dialogue between DC and PCI. Moro&#x27;s main aim was to widen the democratic base of the government, including the PCI in the parliamentary majority, in which the cabinets should have been able to represent a larger number of voters and parties. According to him, the DC should have been at the centre of a coalition system based on the principles of consociative democracy. This process was known as Historic Compromise.

Between 1976 and 1977, Berlinguer&#x27;s PCI broke with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, implementing, together with the Spanish and French Communist parties, a new political theory and strategy known as Eurocommunism. Such a move made eventual cooperation more acceptable for DC voters, and the two parties began an intense parliamentary debate in a moment of deep social crises. In 1977, Moro was personally involved in international disputes. He strongly defended Rumor during the parliamentary debate on the Lockheed scandal, and some journalists reported that Moro himself might have been involved in the bribery. The allegation, with the aim of politically destroying Moro and avoiding the risk of a DC–PCI–PSI cabinet, failed when Moro was cleared on 3 March 1978, thirteen days before his kidnapping.

The early 1978 proposal by Moro of starting a cabinet composed of DC and PSI members, externally supported by the PCI was strongly opposed by both superpowers of the Cold War era. The United States feared that the cooperation between PCI and DC might have allowed the PCI to gain information on strategic NATO military plans and installations. Moreover, the participation in the government of communists in a Western country would have represented a cultural failure for the United States. On the other hand, the Soviets considered the potential participation by the PCI in a cabinet as a form of emancipation from Moscow and rapprochement to the Americans.

== Kidnapping and death ==

On 16 March 1978, on via Fani, in Rome, a unit of the militant far-left organization known as Red Brigades (BR) blocked the two-car convoy that was carrying Moro and kidnapped him, murdering his five bodyguards. On the day of his kidnapping, Moro was on his way to a session of the Chamber of Deputies, where a discussion was to take place regarding a vote of confidence for a new government led by Andreotti, that would for the first time have the support of the PCI. It was to be the first implementation of Moro&#x27;s strategic political vision. Additionally, he was considered to be the frontrunner for the 1978 Italian presidential election.

In the following days, trade unions called for a general strike, while security forces made hundreds of raids in Rome, Milan, Turin, and other cities searching for Moro&#x27;s location, as places linked to Moro and the kidnapping became centres of minor pilgrimage. An estimated 16 million Italians took part in the mass public demonstrations. After a few days, even Pope Paul VI, a close friend of Moro&#x27;s, intervened, offering himself in exchange for Moro. Despite the 13,000 police officers mobilized, 40,000 house searches, and 72,000 roadblocks, the police did not carry out any arrests.

The event has been compared to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and referred to as Italy&#x27;s 9/11. Although Italy was not the sole European country to experience terrorism, the list including France, Germany, Ireland, and Spain, the murder of Moro was the apogee of Italy&#x27;s Years of Lead. Many details of Moro&#x27;s kidnapping remain heavily disputed and unknown. This has led to the promotion of a number of alternative theories about the events, including conspiracy theories, which remain popular in Italy, where the judicial truth, which attributes responsibility for the operation exclusively to the Red Brigades, has failed to take root in the collective memory of Italians. Alternative theories gained traction with the institution of a special inquiring committee by the Italian Parliament in 2014 that concluded its operations in 2018. The committee concluded that the judicial truth was produced on the basis of the confession of the terrorist Valerio Morucci and that other evidence which contradicted his version was downplayed. Among these, other witness testimonies indicated that more than four people fired at Moro&#x27;s convoy, multiple sources report that Moro was held captive in the apartment of Via Massimi 91 in Rome (a property of IOR), and then in Villa Odescalchi on the coast of Palo Laziale, and not in Via Camillo Montalcini 8. In August 2020, about sixty individuals from the world of historical research and political inquiry signed a document denouncing the growing weight that the conspiratorial view on the kidnapping and killing of Moro has in public discourse.

=== Negotiations and captivity letters ===
The Red Brigades proposed exchanging Moro&#x27;s life for the freedom of several prisoners. There has been speculation that during his detention many government officials, including the then interior minister Francesco Cossiga, knew where he was being held. Italian politicians were divided into two factions: one favourable to negotiation (&quot;linea del negoziato&quot;) and the other totally opposing the idea of a negotiated settlement (&quot;linea della fermezza&quot;). The government immediately took a hardline position, namely that the state must not bend to terrorist demands. This position was openly criticized by prominent DC party members, such as Amintore Fanfani and Giovanni Leone, who at the time was serving as president of Italy. All major political forces followed this hardline stance. This included the PCI, which supported democracy and was part of the Italian Parliament; the PCI was accused by the Red Brigades of being a pawn of the bourgeoisie. Exceptions were the Italian Socialist Party led by Bettino Craxi and the extra-parliamentary left.

On 2 April 1978, Romano Prodi, Mario Baldassarri, and Alberto Clò, three professors of the University of Bologna, passed on a tip about a safe-house where the Red Brigades might be holding Moro. Prodi stated he had been given the tip by the DC founders from beyond the grave in a séance through the use of a Ouija board, which gave the names of Viterbo, Bolsena, and Gradoli. During the investigation of Moro&#x27;s kidnapping, some members of law enforcement in Italy and of the secret services advocated for the use of torture against terrorists; prominent military members and generals, such as Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa, were against this. Dalla Chiesa once stated: &quot;Italy is a democratic country that could allow itself the luxury of losing Moro, [but] not of the introduction of torture.&quot;

During his kidnapping, Moro wrote several letters to the DC leaders and to Pope Paul VI. Some of those letters, including one that was very critical of Andreotti, were kept secret for more than a decade and published only in the early 1990s. In his letters, Moro said that the state&#x27;s primary focus should be saving lives and that the government should comply with his kidnappers&#x27; demands. Most of the DC&#x27;s leaders argued that the letters did not express Moro&#x27;s genuine wishes, arguing they were written under duress, and thus refused all negotiations. This position was held in stark contrast to the requests of Moro&#x27;s family. In his appeal to the terrorists, Pope Paul VI asked them to release Moro &quot;without conditions&quot;. The specified &quot;without conditions&quot; is controversial; according to some sources, it was added to Paul VI&#x27;s letter against his will, and that the Pope wanted to negotiate with the kidnappers to secure the safety of Moro. According to Antonio Mennini, Pope Paul VI had saved ₤10 billion to pay a ransom in order to save Moro.

=== Murder ===
When it became clear that the government would continue to refuse to negotiate, the Red Brigades held a summary trial, known as &quot;the people&#x27;s trial&quot;, in which Moro was found guilty and sentenced to death. They then sent a last demand to the Italian authorities, stating that if 16 Red Brigades prisoners were not released, Moro would be killed. The Italian authorities responded with a large-scale manhunt, which was unsuccessful. On 7 May 1978, Moro sent a farewell letter to his wife. He wrote: &quot;They have told me that they are going to kill me in a little while, I kiss you for the last time.&quot;

On 9 May 1978, after 55 days of captivity, the terrorists placed Moro in a car and told him to cover himself with a blanket, saying that they were going to transport him to another location. After Moro was covered, they shot him ten times. According to the official reconstruction after a series of trials, the killer was Mario Moretti. Moro&#x27;s body was left in the trunk of a red Renault 4 on Via Michelangelo Caetani towards the Tiber River near the Roman Ghetto. After the recovery of Moro&#x27;s body, Cossiga resigned as interior minister. Pope Paul VI personally officiated at Moro&#x27;s funeral mass.

=== New theories, revelations, and controversies ===
On 23 January 1983, an Italian court sentenced 32 members of the BR to life imprisonment for their role in the kidnapping and murder of Moro, among other crimes. Many elements and facts have never been fully cleared up, despite a series of trials, and this led to a number of other alternative theories about the events to become popularized. In 1993, historian expressed doubts about what was said by the Mafia &quot;pentiti&quot; in relation to the Moro affair because, comparing the two memorials (the amputee of 1978 and the complete of 1990), he said that Moro&#x27;s allegations addressed to Andreotti were the same, so Andreotti had no interest to order the murder of Carmine Pecorelli, who could not threaten him to publish things already known and publicly available. Andreotti underwent a trial for his role in the assassination of Pecorelli. He was acquitted in the first instance trial (1999), convicted in the second (2002), and acquitted by Italy&#x27;s Supreme Court of Cassation (2003). In a 2012 interview with Ulisse Spinnato Vega of Agenzia Clorofilla, the BR co-founders Alberto Franceschini and Renato Curcio remembered Pecorelli. Franceschini stated: &quot;Pecorelli, before dying, said that both the United States and the Soviet Union wanted Moro&#x27;s death.&quot; Additionally, that Moro was suffering from Stockholm syndrome was questioned by the two reports of the Italian Parliament&#x27;s inquiry about the Moro affair. According to this view, Moro was at the height of his faculties, he was very recognizable, and at some point it was him who was leading the negotiation for his own liberation and salvation. This position was supported by Leonardo Sciascia, who discussed it in the minority report he signed as a member of the first parliamentary commission and in his book &quot;L&#x27;affaire Moro&quot;.

In 2005, Sergio Flamigni, a leftist politician and writer who had served on a parliamentary inquiry on the Moro case, suggested the involvement of the Operation Gladio network directed by NATO. He asserted that Gladio had manipulated Moretti as a way to take over the Red Brigades to effect a strategy of tension aimed at creating popular demand for a new, right-wing law-and-order regime. In 2006, Steve Pieczenik was interviewed by Emmanuel Amara in his documentary film &quot;Les derniers jours d&#x27;Aldo Moro&quot; (&quot;The Last Days of Aldo Moro&quot;). In the interview, Pieczenik, a conspiracy theorist, and expert on international terrorism and negotiating strategies who had been brought to Italy as a consultant to Cossiga&#x27;s Crisis Committee, stated: &quot;We had to sacrifice Aldo Moro to maintain the stability of Italy.&quot; Pieczenik maintained that the United States had to &quot;instrumentalize the Red Brigades&quot;. According to him, the decision to have Moro killed was taken during the fourth week of his detention, when Moro was thought to be revealing state secrets in his letters, namely the existence of Gladio. In another interview, Cossiga revealed that the Crisis Committee had also leaked, in a form of black propaganda, a false statement attributed to the Red Brigades that Moro was already dead. This was intended to communicate to the kidnappers that further negotiations would be useless since the government had written Moro off.

== Legacy ==

As a Christian democrat with social-democratic tendencies, Moro is widely considered one of the ideological fathers of modern Italian centre-left, having led the first centre-left government in the history of the Italian Republic, the Organic centre-left. He was the leading figure of the left wing of the DC, which he steered towards the left as the party&#x27;s secretary-general from 1959 to 1964. While he was prime minister, a land reform was implemented in 1964; it has been described as the first step towards abolishing sharecropping. Landless tenants were given cheap credit in order to allow them to own the land. Economically, Moro&#x27;s policies are seen as a response to socialist influence. Although central planning instruments were never used, a five-year economic programme was established in 1965.

During his political life, Moro implemented numerous reforms that deeply changed Italian social life; along with his long-time friend and at the same time opponent, Amintore Fanfani, he was the protagonist of a long-standing political phase, which brought the DC towards more left-wing politics through a cooperation with the Italian Socialist Party first and the Italian Communist Party later. Due to his reformist stances but also for his tragic death, Moro has often been compared to John F. Kennedy and Olof Palme.

According to media reports on 26 September 2012, the Holy See received a file on beatification for Moro; this is the first step to becoming a saint in the Catholic Church. In April 2015, it was reported that the process of beatification might be suspended or closed following the recent controversies. The postulator stated that the process would continue when the discrepancies were cleared up. The halting of proceedings was due to Mennini, the priest who heard his last confession, being allowed to provide a statement to a tribunal in regards to Moro&#x27;s kidnapping and confession. Following this, the beatification process was resumed. In January 2022, a note claiming responsibility for the abduction of Moro was auctioned despite widespread condemnation.

<doc id="52545" wikidata="Q1545237" url="?curid=52545" title="Semiology (Gregorian chant)">
<text>Semiology (from Greek σημεῖον &quot;sēmeion&quot;, &quot;a sign, a mark&quot;) is a branch of Gregorian Chant research. Semiology refers specifically to the study of the neumes as found in the earliest fully notated manuscripts of Gregorian Chant, the oldest of which have been dated to the 9th century. The first application of the term &#x27;semiology&#x27; (which first appeared in the 1960s) for the study of Latin chant was made by Dom Eugène Cardine (1905–1988), a monk of the Abbey of Solesmes. In this context, &#x27;semiology&#x27; is understood as &#x27;the study of musical signs&#x27;. Text and neumatic notation, together with significative letters adjoined to the neumes, presents an effective and integrated mnemonic for the rhythmical interpretation and the melody. While Gregorian palaeography offers a description of the various neumes and their rhythmical and melodic values, Gregorian semiology explains their meaning for practical interpretation. 

==History of Gregorian chant ==
In the 19th century, palaeographical work relating to chant was done in various places in Europe against the background of a performance style based on proportional durational values that were assigned to various deteriorated forms of chant used in various locales.

The main player in the history of Gregorian chant semiology in the 19th century is the Benedictine community of the Abbey of St Peter in Solesmes, which was established in 1833 by Fr Prosper Guéranger, who wished to create single authoritative editions of chant via paleographical study. This led to the scholarly monks of the abbey, chief among whom was Dom Paul Jausions, spending over half a century finding and copying the most ancient chant manuscripts. Under Guéranger, the monks of Solesmes advocated singing Gregorian chant in a free musical metre giving the majority of sung notes the same durational length. This interpretation was contrary to much contemporary practice elsewhere and at odds with scholars who backed the use of long and short notes related in strict durational proportion as per polyphonic singing.

The publication of Gontiér&#x27;s &quot;Méthode Raisonée de plain-chant&quot; (1859) was followed by Dom Pothier&#x27;s &quot;Mélodie Grégorienne d&#x27;après la tradition&quot; (1880) in which he advocated singing the chant in &#x27;rythme oratoire&#x27; (oratorical rhythm), which still involved giving the majority of sung notes the same durational length. In 1889, Dom André Mocquereau initiated the &quot;Paleographie Musicale&quot; periodicals which saw the publication of &quot;facsimiles&quot; of most ancient chant manuscripts to make them more accessible to scholars. Dom Pothier disapproved of this initiative.

In his third volume of &quot;Études de science musicale&quot;, published in 1898, Antoine Dechevrens laid out a comprehensive system of interpreting the neumes of Sankt Gallen style in proportional note lengths. Peter Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Neumenkunde&quot; (1905) volume set out the various musical signs of all the most ancient notational styles historically and paleographically, including Jewish and Byzantine neumes, while providing a number of facsimile illustrations, giving rhythmically proportional values for the musical signs along with a few examples of proportional interpretations of certain chants in modern Western European notation.

The Holy See set up a commission which ran from 1904 till 1913, headed by Pothier, and an editorial team, run by Mocquereau, to create official chant editions for the Vatican. Mocquereau&#x27;s editorial team only lasted a year: owing to editorial disagreements with Mocquereau, Pothier ended up in charge of the editing which, amongst other things, led to the production of a revised Graduale Romanum in 1908. Mocquereau published &quot;Le nombre musical grégorienne ou rhythmique grégorienne&quot; (two volumes) in 1908 &amp; 1927, in which he presented his own understanding of Gregorian rhythm, several elements of which have since been generally discredited. Two elements which have not been discredited are the recognition of the existence of note lengthening, and the notion of &#x27;nuancing&#x27;, i.e., altering note durations by very small, non-proportional values. One-note syllables were declared to be normally short in duration, their written length being interpreted as &#x27;graphic licence&#x27;.

In 1934, Dom Gregory Murray&#x27;s anti-proportionalist &quot;A Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; was published. In the same year, a series of articles on the subject of the rhythmic quantities of Gregorian musical signs began to be published, entitled &#x27;La Question Rhythmique Grégorienne&#x27; by the Abbé G Delorme. This work concluded that certain notational styles contained two distinct signs for any single note and that this difference must be related to rhythm rather than pitch.

The next person to work out a comprehensively coherent analysis of the various neumes and their rhythmic durations was Dr Jan Vollaerts. Using comparative analysis of all the material available to him, Vollaerts was able to show the internal logic and coherence in the neumatic notation with regard to a proper articulation of the verbal-melodic line. In his posthumously published book, &#x27;Rhythmic Proportions in Early Medieval Ecclesiastical Chant&#x27; (Brill, 1958), where the term &#x27;semiotic&#x27; is used, tables are presented of neumes of different notational styles once used in various parts of Europe (e.g., Nonantola, Laon, Brittany, Aquitaine, Switzerland). One-note, two-note, three-note neumes as found in the various notations are dealt with chapter by chapter. The neumes of one-note syllables were declared to be generally long in duration, as marked in Nonantola and Laon notation.

In the book, singing chant to proportional durations is advocated. This is supported in the book by the evidence of Latin medieval theoretical writings which overwhelmingly advocate singing note lengths according to long and short notes bearing durations defined by simple ratios. Certain of the same writings criticise any lengthening or shortening of these ratios, although certain writings also recognise that such practice existed.

In a volte face, Dom Gregory Murray published two booklets, presenting the same views as Vollaerts. In 1957, he published &quot;Gregorian Rhythm in the Gregorian Centuries; the Literary Evidence&quot; which presented excerpts from the medieval theoretical writings in English and Latin. In 1959, he published &quot;The Authentic Rhythm of Gregorian Chant&quot; which statedly presented, in edited fashion,
Delorme&#x27;s and Vollaerts&#x27; arguments.

This work was followed in 1968 by the book &#x27;Semiologia Gregoriana&#x27; by Dom Eugène Cardine. In this book, a fairly comprehensive table of the neumes used by the school of Sankt Gallen is presented. Unlike Fr. Vollaerts, Dom Cardine did not view the musical signs as representing proportional note values, and he viewed one-note syllables in Sankt Gallen notation as normally representing a short duration. Unlike Vollaerts, Cardine did not present all the styles of notation to the reader for examination, which means that the reader had no access to certain notations, such as those of Nonantola and Laon, which mark most one-note syllables with a sign indicating a lengthening of duration.

Vertical, from top to bottom, in the first column, Cardine starts off with neumes representing a single note, then two-, three- and four-note groups and many compound neumes and ornamental neumes. Horizontally, Cardine enters all the variations of the main neume. The system of neumes used in most of the earliest notational styles is rhythmically complex and sophisticated, particularly the styles of Laon and Einsiedeln Abbey.

Cardine states that natural speech-rhythms provide a rhythmic basis for the declamation of Gregorian chant. He divides syllabic time into three categories: &quot;normal&quot; &quot;enlarged, more heavy&quot; and &quot;light, more liquid&quot;. Under this interpretation, a one-note syllable would not be considered usually &quot;long&quot; or &quot;longer&quot;.

Cardine was employed as a teacher of palaeography and semiology by the Vatican from 1952 to 1984 at the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in Rome. His work in the field of semiology was recognized and supported by commissions and led to the publication of the &#x27;Graduale Triplex&#x27; in 1979, which was based on Cardine&#x27;s personal Roman Gradual in which, over the years, he had copied many neumes from Sankt Gallen school manuscripts. Two students of Cardine, Rupert Fischer and M.C. Billecocq, undertook the strenuous task to manually copy the neumes of two schools of generally concordant rhythmic manuscripts (Einsiedeln/Sankt Gallen and Laon) into the new type-set Roman Gradual of 1974. In hindsight, the &#x27;Graduale Triplex&#x27; proved a great stimulus for self-study as it made important material available in a handy book. The momentum of its publication has created a demand for a new Gradual as the 1974 Gradual contains many incidental or structural melodic errors. As a response to this need and following the Holy See&#x27;s invitation to edit a more critical edition, in 2011the first volume &quot;De Dominicis et Festis&quot; of the &quot;Graduale Novum Editio Magis Critica Iuxta SC 117&quot;was published by Libreria Editrice Vatican and ConBrio Verlagsgesellschaft, Regensburg. 

The growing number of choirs or scholae that perform Gregorian Chant according to these developments are thus said to follow the &#x27;semiological approach&#x27;. The International Society for the Study of Gregorian Chant (Associazione Internazionale Studi di Canto Gregoriano) carries on the legacy of Eugène Cardine, putting special emphasis on bridging the gap between Gregorian research and praxis. The Society has some 500 members in 30 countries worldwide.

Other students of Cardine, who, like Fischer and Billecocg, held a professorate at the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in Rome or other church music institutes, include Marie-Noel Colette, Luigi Agustoni, Johannes Berchmans Göschl and Godehard Joppich.

A smaller school of singing chant using proportional durations, as per Fr Vollaerts, has continued in the hands of Jan van Biezen in the Netherlands, R John Blackley in Maine, USA, and Luca Ricossa in Switzerland.

In the 1983 &quot;Liber Hymnarius&quot; from Solesmes, it is stated that, &quot;When an ordinary syllable is set to one note, this represents the fundamental rhythmic value used in Gregorian chant (i.e. valor syllabicus medius).&quot; This implies that the one-note syllable (and thus the fundamental rhythmic value of chant) is no longer interpreted by Solesmes as being normally short in duration.

<text>Genesis were an English rock band formed at Charterhouse School, in Godalming, Surrey, in 1967. The band&#x27;s longest-lasting and most commercially successful line-up consisted of keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford and drummer/singer Phil Collins. In the 1970s, during which the band also included singer Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett, Genesis were among the pioneers of progressive rock. Banks and Rutherford have been the only constant members throughout the band&#x27;s history.

The band were formed by Charterhouse pupils Banks, Rutherford, Gabriel, guitarist Anthony Phillips and drummer Chris Stewart. Their name was provided by former Charterhouse pupil and pop impresario Jonathan King, who arranged for them to record several singles and their debut album &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot; in 1969. After splitting from King, the band began touring, signed with Charisma Records and shifted to progressive rock with their succeeding album &quot;Trespass&quot; (1970). Phillips departed after the album&#x27;s recording, with Banks, Rutherford and Gabriel recruiting Collins and Hackett before recording &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; (1971). Their live shows began to feature Gabriel&#x27;s theatrical costumes and performances. &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1972) was their first charting album in the UK and &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; (1973) reached number three, featuring their first UK hit &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot;. The concept album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (1974) was promoted with a transatlantic tour and an elaborate stage show, before Gabriel left the group.

Collins took over as lead singer, and as a four-piece the group released &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; and &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; (both 1976) with continued success. Hackett left the band in 1977, reducing the band to a three-piece of Banks, Rutherford and Collins. Their ninth studio album, &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; (1978), contained the band&#x27;s first major hit &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;. Their next five studio albums – &quot;Duke&quot; (1980), &quot;Abacab&quot; (1981), &quot;Genesis&quot; (1983), &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; (1986) and &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1991) – saw the band embracing a more pop-oriented sound and were all commercially successful. Collins left Genesis in 1996 and was replaced by singer Ray Wilson, who appeared on their final studio album &quot;Calling All Stations&quot; (1997). The album&#x27;s disappointing critical and commercial reception led the group to disband. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the Turn It On Again Tour in 2007 and again in 2021 for The Last Domino? Tour.

With between 100 million and 150 million albums sold worldwide, Genesis are one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. Their discography includes 15 studio and 6 live albums. They have won numerous awards, including a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video for &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;, and have inspired a number of tribute bands recreating Genesis shows from various stages of the band&#x27;s career. In 2010, Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==History==
===1967–1969: Formation, early demos and &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;===

The founding members of Genesis, Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Anthony “Ant” Phillips, Mike Rutherford and drummer Chris Stewart, met at Charterhouse School, a public school in Godalming, Surrey. Banks and Gabriel arrived at the school in September 1963, Rutherford in September 1964 and Phillips in April 1965. The five were members in either one of the school&#x27;s two bands; Phillips and Rutherford were in Anon with singer Richard Macphail, bassist Rivers Jobe and drummer Rob Tyrrell, while Gabriel, Banks and Stewart made up Garden Wall.

In January 1967, after both groups had split, Phillips and Rutherford continued to write together and proceeded to make a demo tape at a friend&#x27;s home-made studio, inviting Banks, Gabriel and Stewart to record with them in the process. The group recorded six songs: &quot;Don&#x27;t Want You Back&quot;, &quot;Try a Little Sadness&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Beautiful&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Me&quot;, &quot;Listen on Five&quot; and &quot;Patricia&quot;, an instrumental. When they wished to have them professionally recorded they sought Charterhouse alumnus Jonathan King, who seemed a natural choice as their publisher and producer following the success of his 1965 UK top five single, &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Gone to the Moon&quot;. A friend of the group gave the tape to King, who was immediately enthusiastic. Under King&#x27;s direction, the group, aged between 15 and 17, signed a one-year recording contract with Decca Records.

From August to December 1967, the five recorded a selection of potential singles at Regent Sound Studios in Denmark Street, London, where they attempted longer and more complex pieces, but King advised them to stick to more straightforward pop. In response Banks and Gabriel wrote &quot;The Silent Sun&quot;, a pastiche of the Bee Gees, one of King&#x27;s favourite bands, which was recorded with orchestral arrangements added by Arthur Greenslade. The group exchanged various names for the band, including King&#x27;s suggestion of &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Angels&quot;, before taking King&#x27;s suggestion of &quot;Genesis&quot;, indicating the start of his production career. King chose &quot;The Silent Sun&quot; as their first single, with &quot;That&#x27;s Me&quot; on the B-side, released in February 1968. It achieved some airplay on BBC Radio One and Radio Caroline, but failed to sell. A second single, &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; / &quot;One-Eyed Hound&quot;, followed in May 1968, which also sold little. Three months later, Stewart left the group to continue with his studies. He was replaced by fellow Charterhouse pupil John Silver.

King believed that the group would achieve greater success with an album. The result, &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;, was produced at Regent Sound in ten days during their school&#x27;s summer break in August 1968. King assembled the tracks as a concept album, which he produced. Greenslade added further orchestral arrangements to the songs, but the band were not informed of this fact until the album was released. Phillips was upset about Greenslade&#x27;s additions. When Decca found an American band already named Genesis, King refused to change his group&#x27;s name. He reached a compromise by removing their name from the album cover, resulting in a minimalist design with the album title printed on a plain black background. When the album was released in March 1969, it became a commercial failure because many record shops filed it in the religious music section upon seeing the title. Banks recalled that &quot;after a year or so&quot;, the album had &quot;sold 649 copies&quot;. A third single, &quot;Where the Sour Turns to Sweet&quot; / &quot;In Hiding&quot;, was released in June 1969. None of the releases was commercially successful. The lack of commercial success led to the band&#x27;s split with King and Decca. King continued to hold the rights to the album, which has seen numerous reissues. In 1974, it peaked on the US chart at No. 170.

After the album was recorded, the band went their separate ways for a year; Gabriel and Phillips stayed at Charterhouse to finish exams, Banks enrolled at Sussex University and Rutherford studied at Farnborough College of Technology. They regrouped in mid-1969 to discuss their future, for their offers in further education might result in the group splitting up. Phillips and Rutherford decided to make music their full-time career, for they were starting to write more complex music than their earlier songs with King. After Banks and Gabriel decided to follow suit, the four returned to Regent Sound in August 1969 and recorded four more demos with Silver: &quot;Family&quot; (later known as &quot;Dusk&quot;), &quot;White Mountain&quot;, &quot;Going Out to Get You&quot; and &quot;Pacidy&quot;. The tape was rejected by each record label that heard it. Silver then left the group to study leisure management in the United States. His replacement, drummer and carpenter John Mayhew, was found when Mayhew looked for work and left his phone number &quot;with people all over London&quot;.

===1969–1970: First gigs, signing with Charisma, &quot;Trespass&quot; and Phillips&#x27;s departure===
In late 1969, Genesis retreated to a cottage owned by Macphail&#x27;s parents, in Wotton, Surrey, to write, rehearse and develop their stage performance. They took their work seriously, playing together for as much as eleven hours a day. Their first live gig as Genesis followed in September 1969 at a teenager&#x27;s birthday. It was the start of a series of live shows in small venues across the UK, which included a radio performance broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Night Ride&quot; show, on 22 February 1970, and a spot at the Atomic Sunrise Festival held at the Roundhouse in Chalk Farm a month later. During this time the band met with various record labels regarding contract offers. Initial discussions with Chris Blackwell of Island and Chris Wright of Chrysalis were unsuccessful. In March 1970, during the band&#x27;s six-week Tuesday night residency at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in Soho, members of Rare Bird, whom Genesis had previously supported live, recommended the band to producer and A&amp;R man John Anthony of Charisma Records. Anthony attended one of their shows and enjoyed them enough to convince his boss, label owner Tony Stratton Smith, to watch their next appearance. Smith recalled, &quot;Their potential was immediately apparent ... the material was good and their performance was good ... It was a long shot, because they needed time to find their strength ... but I was prepared to make that commitment&quot;. He agreed to a record and management deal within two weeks, paying Genesis an initial sum of £10 a week (equivalent to £ in 2025).

Genesis stayed at Wotton until April 1970, by which time they had enough new material for a second album. Recording for &quot;Trespass&quot; began in June at Trident Studios in London, with Anthony as producer and David Hentschel hired as assistant engineer. The album included longer and more complex songs than their first, blending folk and progressive rock elements with various time signature changes, as in the nine-minute song &quot;The Knife&quot;. &quot;Trespass&quot; is the first in a series of three Genesis album cover designs by Paul Whitehead. He had completed the design before the band decided to include &quot;The Knife&quot; on the album. Feeling the cover no longer reflected the album&#x27;s overall mood, the band persuaded Whitehead to slash a knife across the canvas and have the result photographed. Released in October 1970, &quot;Trespass&quot; reached No. 1 in Belgium in 1971 and No. 98 in the UK in 1984. &quot;The Knife&quot; was released as a single in May 1971. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; briefly mentioned the album unfavourably following its 1974 reissue: &quot;It&#x27;s spotty, poorly defined, at times innately boring&quot;. &quot;Genesis seemed to be dying a death around our second album&quot;, Gabriel told Mark Blake. &quot;We couldn&#x27;t get arrested. So I got a place at the London School of Film Technique.&quot;
After &quot;Trespass&quot; was recorded, ill-health and developing stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show with the band took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group&#x27;s creativity and several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated from the rest of the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the greatest threat to the band and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided the group should continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew&#x27;s working-class background clashed with the rest of the band, which affected his confidence.

=== 1970–1972: Collins and Hackett join and &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; ===
The search for a new guitarist and drummer began with advertisements placed in copies of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth, who already knew Stratton Smith. He recalled, &quot;My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought &#x27;At least I&#x27;m going to be working if I get the gig&#x27;.&quot; Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel&#x27;s parents&#x27; house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth bandmate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. &quot;They put on &quot;Trespass&quot; and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash&quot;. Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, &quot;It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals&quot;. In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl&#x27;s audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.

After a short holiday, Genesis began to write and rehearse as a four-piece band in Farnham, Surrey. The now empty guitar sections in their songs allowed Banks and Rutherford to expand their sound and play what Gabriel described as &quot;interesting chords&quot;. As they had not found a new guitarist, Genesis resumed as a live act with Rutherford adding bass pedals and Banks playing lead guitar lines on a Pianet through a distorted fuzz box amplifier in addition to his keyboard parts, something that he credits in helping him develop his technique. In November 1970, after a second audition with Caryl fell through, Dave Stopps, owner of Friars club in Aylesbury, suggested they use Mick Barnard of The Farm, who joined the band for their gigs; which included Genesis&#x27;s television debut on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Disco 2&quot;. After two months of performances, the band found Barnard lacked in expertise and wished to try someone else. In December, Gabriel spotted a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; advert from Steve Hackett, formerly of Quiet World, who wanted to join a band of &quot;receptive musicians, determined to drive beyond existing stagnant music forms&quot;. Gabriel advised Hackett to become familiar with &quot;Trespass&quot; and attend their upcoming gig at the Lyceum Theatre in London. Hackett auditioned with the group in a flat in Earl&#x27;s Court and formed an instant rapport with Rutherford through a common interest in inverted chords. After Hackett joined in January 1971, Stratton Smith organised a UK tour with Genesis opening for fellow Charisma acts Lindisfarne and Van der Graaf Generator. Their first overseas dates took place in March with gigs in Belgium followed by their first of three consecutive appearances at the annual Reading Festival on 26 June.

Rehearsals for the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, took place at Luxford House near Crowborough, East Sussex, which Stratton Smith had owned. Recording began at Trident Studios in August 1971 with Anthony and Hentschel reprising their respective roles as producer and assistant engineer. The band&#x27;s sound evolved, with Hackett&#x27;s more aggressive electric guitar work and Banks adding a Mellotron previously owned by King Crimson to his set of keyboards. The opening track, &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, originated when Phillips and Mayhew were in the group. The band developed the piece further including the addition of new guitar parts from Hackett. &quot;The Musical Box&quot; and &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; are the first recordings in which Hackett uses the tapping technique. Hackett and Collins wrote &quot;For Absent Friends&quot;, which was the first Genesis track with Collins on lead vocals. On the album&#x27;s cover, Whitehead depicted a Victorian manor house based on Gabriel&#x27;s parents&#x27; home, and scenes and characters from the lyrics to &quot;The Musical Box&quot;.

&quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; was released in November 1971 and reached No. 39 in the UK in 1974. Though the group still had a minor cult following at home, they started to achieve commercial and critical success in mainland Europe, with the album reaching No. 4 in the Italian charts. From November 1971 to August 1972, Genesis toured to support the album, including further visits to Belgium and, for the first time, Italy, where they played to enthusiastic crowds. In January and March 1972 they recorded radio sessions for BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of the Seventies&quot; programme and later in the year performed at the Reading Festival to some critical acclaim. During the tour, Genesis recorded &quot;Happy the Man&quot;, a non-album single, with &quot;Seven Stones&quot; from &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; on its B-side.

===1972–1974: &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;===

Following rehearsals in a dance school in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, Genesis recorded &quot;Foxtrot&quot; at Island Studios in August and September 1972. During the early sessions, disagreements between Charisma and Anthony contributed to the end of his association with Genesis. After two replacement engineers were tried out, the band settled on John Burns and a new producer, Dave Hitchcock.

The album features the 23-minute track &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, a suite of various musical segments. The track included an opening acoustic piece, a Gabriel-penned song called &quot;Willow Farm&quot; and a piece derived from a jam by Banks, Rutherford and Collins called &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8&quot;. Other songs were the science-fiction-themed &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; and the property-development-themed &quot;Get &#x27;Em Out by Friday&quot;. &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was released in on 15 September 1972 and reached No. 12 in the UK. It fared even better in Italy, where it went to No. 1. &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was well received by critics. Chris Welch of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; thought &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was &quot;a milestone in the group&#x27;s career&quot;, &quot;an important point of development in British group music&quot; and that Genesis had reached &quot;a creative peak&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought &quot;Foxtrot&quot; marked the first time &quot;Genesis attacked like a rock band, playing with a visceral power&quot;.

The &quot;Foxtrot&quot; tour covered Europe and North America from September 1972 to August 1973. Gabriel surprised the other members of the band at the National Stadium in Dublin on 28 September 1972 by wearing a costume on stage, following a suggestion by Charisma booking agent Paul Conroy. He went off stage during an instrumental section in &quot;The Musical Box&quot; and reappeared in his wife&#x27;s red dress and a fox&#x27;s head. The incident resulted in front cover reports in the music press, allowing the band to double their performance fee. In December 1972 Stratton Smith organised the band&#x27;s first gigs in the US, with a show at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts and one at Philharmonic Hall in New York City with openers String Driven Thing, in aid of the United Cerebral Palsy Fund. They were well received despite the band complaining of technical issues. Gabriel&#x27;s costumes expanded in the following months to include fluorescent face paint and a cape fitted with bat wings for &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;, several guises throughout &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; and a mask of an old man for &quot;The Musical Box&quot;. An album of recordings from the following UK leg, initially recorded for the American radio programme &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot;, was released as &quot;Genesis Live&quot; in July 1973. It reached No. 9 in the UK and No. 105 in the US.

In the summer of 1973, Genesis re-signed their contracts with Charisma. Stratton Smith said they got &quot;a much improved deal&quot; despite them being able to get a better one with a bigger label, but the group were loyal and trusted the label with their careers. With a new contract and thus a green-light for a new album, Genesis recorded &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; at Island Studios in August 1973, the second Genesis album that Burns co-produced. Much of it was written at Una Billings School of Dance and Chessington. Gabriel contributed lyrics based on the idea of commercialism and the decline of English culture and the rise in American influences. Its title refers to a UK Labour Party slogan to make it clear to music critics who may have thought Genesis were beginning to &quot;sell out&quot; to the US. &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; features an extended electric guitar solo from Hackett. The album&#x27;s cover is a modified version of a painting named &quot;The Dream&quot; by Betty Swanwick who added a lawn mower to tie the image to the lyrics of &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot;.
&quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; was released on 5 October 1973 and received favourably by critics, though slightly less enthusiastically than &quot;Foxtrot&quot;. The album reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 70 in the US. By this time, Genesis had made little effort to organise their finances and were £150,000 in debt (equivalent to £ in 2025).. They hired promoter Tony Smith as their new manager to improve their fortunes and published the band&#x27;s subsequent music through his company, Hit &amp; Run Music Publishing. The &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; tour visited Europe and North America between September 1973 and May 1974. Their six shows in three days at The Roxy in Los Angeles were well received by audiences and critics. The success of the tour earned the group the &quot;Top Stage Band&quot; title by readers of &quot;NME&quot;. At its conclusion, Macphail resigned as their tour manager as he wished to pursue other interests. &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; was released as a UK single with &quot;Twilight Alehouse&quot;, a non-album track recorded in 1972; it reached No. 21 following its release in February 1974. Its success led to an offer for Genesis to appear on BBC&#x27;s national show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The group thought this would not suit their image and they declined the offer.

=== 1974–1975: &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; and Gabriel&#x27;s departure ===
In June 1974, Genesis started work on their double concept album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;. This marked a point at which Gabriel&#x27;s relationship with the rest of the group became increasingly strained, which contributed to his departure. The album was written at Headley Grange in East Hampshire, where upon their arrival the building had been left in a very poor state by the previous band, with rat infestations and excrement on the floor. Gabriel objected to Rutherford&#x27;s idea of an album based on &quot;The Little Prince&quot; by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, thinking the idea was &quot;too twee&quot;. He proposed to the band a less fantastical and more complicated story involving Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City who embarks on a spiritual quest to establish his freedom and identity while meeting several bizarre characters on the way. Gabriel wrote the story with influences from &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;a kind of punk&quot; twist to &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, author Carl Jung and the film &quot;El Topo&quot; by Alejandro Jodorowsky. Most of the album&#x27;s lyrics were written by Gabriel, leaving much of its music to the rest of the group. His absence from a considerable amount of writing sessions due to difficulties with his wife&#x27;s first birth was something about which Rutherford and Banks &quot;were horribly unsupportive&quot;. Gabriel also left the group when director William Friedkin asked him to write a screenplay, but returned after the project was shelved. In August 1974, production moved to Glaspant Manor in Carmarthenshire, Wales with Burns as co-producer, operating Island Studios&#x27; mobile equipment. Further work and mixing took place at Island, where Brian Eno contributed synthesizers and effects that the album&#x27;s sleeve credits as &quot;Enossification&quot;. When Gabriel asked Eno how the band could repay him, Eno said he needed a drummer for his track &quot;Mother Whale Eyeless&quot;. Collins said, &quot;I got sent upstairs as payment&quot;. Gabriel was pleased with Eno&#x27;s work but Banks was less enthusiastic.
&quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; was released in November 1974 and reached No. 10 in the UK and No. 41 in the US. &quot;Counting Out Time&quot; and &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; were released as singles in 1974 and 1975, respectively. Its sleeve is the first of four Genesis albums designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. From November 1974 to May 1975, Genesis completed 102 dates across North America and Europe as part of &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; tour. Their set included &quot;The Lamb...&quot; performed in its entirety with an encore, a decision that was not supported by the entire band considering most of the audience were not yet familiar with the large amount of new material. The stage show involved new, more elaborate costumes worn by Gabriel, three backdrop screens that displayed 1,450 slides from eight projectors, and a laser lighting display. Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel&#x27;s theatrics and took the band&#x27;s musical performance as secondary, which irritated the rest of the band.

During their stay in Cleveland during the tour, Gabriel told the band he would leave at its conclusion. He wrote a statement regarding his departure to the English press that was published in August 1975 titled &quot;Out, Angels Out&quot;, explaining he had become disillusioned with the music industry and wanted to spend extended time with his family. Banks later stated, &quot;Pete was also getting too big for the group. He was being portrayed as if he was &#x27;the man&#x27; and it really wasn&#x27;t like that. It was a very difficult thing to accommodate. So it was actually a bit of a relief.&quot;

===1975–1977: Collins becomes frontman, &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;, &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; and Hackett&#x27;s departure===
Following the &quot;Lamb&quot; tour, Hackett recorded his first solo album &quot;Voyage of the Acolyte&quot; as he felt unsure that Genesis would survive following Gabriel&#x27;s departure. He reconvened with the remaining group members in London in July 1975. During this time, Collins began drumming with instrumental jazz rock band Brand X, with whom he would be a semi-regular member whenever Genesis were on down time for the next five years. Collins&#x27;s idea of Genesis continuing as an instrumental group was quickly rejected by the others as they thought it would become boring. Rehearsals for &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; took place in Acton where material was quickly written and with little effort; most of &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot; and &quot;Squonk&quot; was put together in the first three days. Recording began in October 1975 at Trident Studios with Hentschel as producer. As a replacement singer had not been found, the band decided to record the album without vocals and audition singers as they went. They placed an anonymous advertisement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for &quot;a singer for a Genesis-type group&quot;, which received around 400 replies. Collins proceeded to teach selected applicants the songs; Witches Brew frontman and flautist Mick Strickland was invited into the studio to sing, but the backing tracks were in a key outside of his natural range and the band decided not to work with him. Having failed to find a suitable vocalist, Collins went into the studio and attempted to sing &quot;Squonk&quot;. His performance was well received by the band and they decided that he should be their new lead vocalist. Collins then sang on the remaining tracks.
&quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; was released in February 1976 and was a commercial and critical success for the band. The album reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. The title track was released as a single, though it did not chart. In June, the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Institute for selling over 100,000 copies which helped the band clear the £400,000 of debt (equivalent to £ in 2025) they owed when Gabriel left. For the first time in their career Genesis filmed promotional videos for their songs, including &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; and &quot;Robbery, Assault and Battery&quot;. Before the upcoming tour, Collins sought a drummer he felt comfortable with while singing; he chose Bill Bruford who offered to do the job. From March to July 1976, Genesis performed across North America and Europe with the &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; tour, to enthusiastic crowds. Collins adopted a more humorous rapport with the audience, unlike Gabriel&#x27;s theatrical approach, which was successful. The shows in Glasgow and Stafford were filmed for their concert film &quot;&quot;, released in cinemas in February 1977 as a double bill with &quot;White Rock&quot;.

In September 1976, Genesis relocated to Relight Studios at Hilvarenbeek in the Netherlands with Hentschel to record &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;. It was put together in a short amount of time and a considerable amount of material was written beforehand, of which the most suitable songs were picked for development. Rutherford spoke of the band&#x27;s conscious effort to distance themselves from songs inspired by fantasy, something that their past albums &quot;were full of&quot;. The band spent roughly six weeks writing the album with a basic form of each track put down in twelve days. Additional recording and production work was done at Trident Studios that October. Hackett, having already released a solo album, enjoyed the greater amount of control over the recording process that working within a group could not provide. He felt his songs, including &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Touch&quot; (which he later released on his second album &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Touch!&quot;) were rejected from the final track order in favour of material that Banks, in particular, had put forward. Collins spoke of the situation, &quot;We just wanted to use what we agreed was the strongest material, irrespective of who wrote it&quot;. &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; was released in December 1976 and reached No. 6 in the UK and No. 26 in the US. Rutherford&#x27;s track, &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot;, became its sole single and went to No. 43 in the UK. Its B-side is &quot;It&#x27;s Yourself&quot;, originally intended for &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;.
Prior to the 1977 tour, Bruford declined an offer to return as second drummer, leaving Collins searching for a replacement. He heard American drummer Chester Thompson, of Frank Zappa&#x27;s band and Weather Report, play a drum passage on &quot;More Trouble Every Day&quot; from Zappa&#x27;s live album &quot;Roxy &amp; Elsewhere&quot;. Collins said, &quot;It floored me completely ... I had never met him. I rang him up and said, &#x27;Hi Chester, I&#x27;ve heard your stuff, would you like to play with Genesis?&#x27; ... He didn&#x27;t even audition!&quot; Genesis toured &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; from January to July 1977 across Europe, North America and, for the first time, Brazil. The stage show cost £400,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025). which featured a new PA system, lasers and smoke, and lighting supplied from two rows of Boeing 747 aircraft landing lights. Touring began on 1 January with three sold-out shows at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where 80,000 applications were made for the 8,000 available tickets. They returned to London for three nights at Earls Court, then the largest arena in Britain, supported by Richie Havens. The band&#x27;s growing popularity in North America led to television appearances and concerts organised in larger venues than previous tours, including Madison Square Garden in New York City. Their Brazilian dates were attended by over 150,000 people and a proposed 100,000-person gig was cancelled over rioting fears. An armed bodyguard accompanied each member throughout their stay.

In May 1977 Genesis released &quot;Spot the Pigeon&quot;, an extended play of three tracks left off &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. It was the final Genesis release before Hackett left the group. He had been writing more material on his own and found it increasingly difficult to contribute more of his ideas within a group context. He wished to embark on a solo career and &quot;take the risk in order to find out just how good I was on my own&quot;. News of Hackett&#x27;s departure coincided with the band&#x27;s double live album &quot;Seconds Out&quot;, recorded in Paris on the &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; and &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; tours and released in October 1977. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US.

===1977–1980: &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; and &quot;Duke&quot;===

By the time &quot;Seconds Out&quot; was released, Banks, Rutherford and Collins had already recorded &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;, the first Genesis album recorded as a trio, in September 1977 at Relight Studios with Hentschel as producer. It was then mixed at Trident Studios in London. In order to put across a greater number of musical ideas, the album is a collection of shorter songs. Most of its eleven songs were written individually; Banks contributed four, Rutherford three and Collins one while the remaining three were written collectively. Their new material signalled a change in the band&#x27;s sound with songs becoming more pop-oriented, including the group-written track &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;. Collins recalled it was the only song on the album written from scratch during rehearsals. Rutherford felt comfortable taking on lead guitar duties in addition to his usual rhythm and bass roles, although the band had considered auditioning replacement guitarists or using a session guitarist on the album. Collins later saw the album as &quot;a very vocal, solid album&quot; that lacked more rhythmic tracks like &quot;Los Endos&quot; or songs from &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;, as coming up with ideas on the drums while living in his flat in Ealing with his family was difficult.

&quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; was released in March 1978. It received some mixed reviews from critics at the time owing to the album only containing short songs, which excited new fans but disillusioned those who had been used to the band&#x27;s previous work. Chris Welch wrote a positive review in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, citing a &quot;remarkably powerful&quot; album. It was a commercial success and peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 14 in the US. &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot; was released as its lead single and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 23 in the US, their highest-charting single in both countries since their formation. Its success introduced the band to a new audience, including a larger female interest, helped by its music video airing on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Its success caused some fans to accuse the group of selling out to more commercial music. A follow-up single, &quot;Many Too Many&quot;, was less successful, for it had already appeared on the album.

In the search for a new touring guitarist, Rutherford tried out Pat Thrall and Elliot Randall, followed by Alphonso Johnson of Weather Report, but he was primarily a bassist and could not play Hackett&#x27;s lead guitar parts comfortably. Johnson then suggested American guitarist Daryl Stuermer of Jean-Luc Ponty&#x27;s jazz fusion group, who was more comfortable with various guitar styles. During Stuermer&#x27;s rehearsal in New York City, Rutherford was satisfied with his performance after they played through &quot;Down and Out&quot; and &quot;Squonk&quot;. When Stuermer was chosen, he familiarised himself with a list of 26 songs he was asked to learn by going through five per day. The &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; tour ran from March to December 1978 and visited North America, Europe and, for the first time, Japan. It cost an estimated £2 million to stage (equivalent to £ in 2025). which included the sound system, light and laser displays and additional effects from six computer-controlled mirrors, all of which took eight hours to set up and five to dismantle. One of their shows featured a guest appearance from Gabriel, who sang &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot;. In June, Genesis headlined the year&#x27;s Knebworth Festival, their only UK show that year.

In December 1978, Genesis began a period of inactivity as Collins&#x27;s marriage was at risk of collapse after touring had made him frequently absent from his wife and children. Following a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and Smith, Collins went to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to try and rebuild the family. He explained: &quot;I was never going to leave the band. It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we&#x27;d have had to organise ourselves differently.&quot; Banks and Rutherford decided to put Genesis on an extended break and make their respective debut solo albums, &quot;A Curious Feeling&quot; and &quot;Smallcreep&#x27;s Day&quot;, at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after his attempt to save his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on a new Genesis album, Collins rejoined Brand X for the album &quot;Product&quot;, played the drums on former bandmate Peter Gabriel&#x27;s third album and started writing his own first solo album, &quot;Face Value&quot;, at his home in Shalford, Surrey.

In 1979, Banks and Rutherford moved into Collins&#x27;s home in Shalford to write and rehearse material for &quot;Duke&quot;. The three found the writing process easier and less complicated than &quot;And Then There Were Three&quot;. Rutherford reasoned that this was the case because they were &quot;getting back to the basic stage of ideas being worked on jointly&quot;. Banks put it down to their break in activity, resulting in &quot;good ideas ... which hasn&#x27;t happened for some time&quot;. &quot;Duke&quot; continued the band&#x27;s transition into writing shorter songs. Each member contributed two songs for the group to develop: Banks put forward &quot;Heathaze&quot; and &quot;Cul-de-Sac&quot;, Rutherford used &quot;Man of Our Times&quot; and &quot;Alone Tonight&quot; and Collins had &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; and &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;. All three wrote the remaining five tracks, including &quot;Duchess&quot;, the first Genesis song to feature a drum machine, specifically a Roland CR-78 imported from Japan. In its original form, the album was to contain a 30-minute track based on a fictional character named Albert, but the idea was cancelled to avoid comparisons to &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; from &quot;Foxtrot&quot;. In November, the band recorded &quot;Duke&quot; at Polar Studios with Hentschel reprising his role as producer. Its cover was by French illustrator Lionel Koechlin and featured the character Albert.

Released in March 1980, &quot;Duke&quot; was the band&#x27;s biggest commercial success at the time of release, spending two weeks at No. 1 in the UK and peaking at No. 11 in the US. The album spawned three singles; &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; went to No. 8 in the UK, &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; reached No. 14 in the US, and &quot;Duchess&quot; peaked at No. 46 in the UK. &quot;Duke&quot; was supported with a UK and North American tour from April to June 1980, which began with a 40-date tour of the UK for which all 106,000 tickets were sold within hours of going on sale.

===1980–1985: &quot;Abacab&quot; and &quot;Genesis&quot;===

In November 1980, Genesis bought Fisher Lane Farm, a farmhouse with an adjoining cowshed near Chiddingfold, Surrey, as their new rehearsal and recording facility. The building was remodelled into a studio in four months before recording for &quot;Abacab&quot; began in March 1981. The new environment had a productive effect on the writing process as the band wrote enough for a double album, but they discarded one hour&#x27;s worth of songs that sounded too similar to their past albums. Banks said the band made an effort to keep melodies as simple as possible, which signalled further changes in their direction. The shift was underlined in its production when Hentschel, their producer and engineer since 1975, was replaced by Hugh Padgham after Collins liked his production on &quot;Face Value&quot; and Gabriel&#x27;s third solo album. Production duties were solely credited to the band for the first time with Padgham as their engineer. The album is formed of group written material with an individual song from each member. &quot;No Reply at All&quot; features the Phenix Horns, the horn section of American band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.

&quot;Abacab&quot; was released in September 1981 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 7 in the US. Three singles from the album entered the top forty in both countries; &quot;Abacab&quot; reached No. 9 in the UK and No. 26 in the US, &quot;No Reply at All&quot; reached No. 29 in the US, and &quot;Keep It Dark&quot;, a European-only single, went to No. 33 in the UK. &quot;Abacab&quot; was supported with a tour of Europe and North America from September to December 1981, ending with shows at Wembley Arena and the NEC Birmingham. The tour marked the band&#x27;s first use of the Vari-Lite, a computer-controlled intelligent lighting system. Following a demonstration at The Farm, the band and Smith showed an immediate interest in the technology and became shareholders of the company. In May 1982, three tracks recorded during the &quot;Abacab&quot; sessions – &quot;Paperlate&quot;, &quot;You Might Recall&quot; and &quot;Me and Virgil&quot; – were released as an EP in Europe, &quot;3×3&quot;, which peaked at No. 10 in the UK. Its cover is a homage to the &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; EP by the Beatles, with sleeve notes written by that group&#x27;s former publicist Tony Barrow.
In June 1982, Genesis released the double live album &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; in two different versions. The North American edition contains three sides of live recordings with the fourth comprising the &quot;3×3&quot; tracks and two from the &quot;Duke&quot; sessions. The European release contains a fourth side of extra live tracks. The album coincided with the home video release of the &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; concert film recorded in 1981. A tour of North America and Europe followed that ran from August to September 1982, featuring guest appearances from Bill Bruford and the Phenix Horns. On 2 October, Genesis headlined a one-off concert with Gabriel at the Milton Keynes Bowl under the name Six of the Best. The concert was organised to raise money for Gabriel&#x27;s World of Music, Arts and Dance project that was, by that point, in considerable debt. Hackett, who flew in from abroad, arrived in time to perform the last two songs.

Work on the twelfth Genesis album, &quot;Genesis&quot;, began in March 1983 with Padgham returning as engineer. It was the first album written, recorded and mixed at the remodelled studio at the Farm. Banks remembered the band were scarce for new musical ideas that &quot;felt at times as though we were stretching the material as far as we could&quot;. &quot;Mama&quot; concerns a man&#x27;s obsession with a prostitute at a Cuban brothel. It originated from a beat Rutherford came up with on a LinnDrum machine that was fed through his guitar amplifier and an echo gate. Collins&#x27;s laugh on the track originated from &quot;The Message&quot; by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Released in October 1983, &quot;Genesis&quot; went to No. 1 in the UK and peaked at No. 9 in the US, where it reached Platinum by December that year and went on to sell over four million copies. Three tracks were released as singles; &quot;Mama&quot; reached No. 4 in the UK, their highest-charting UK single to date, and &quot;That&#x27;s All&quot; reached No. 6 in the US. The Mama Tour ran from late 1983 through to 1984, covering North America and five UK shows in Birmingham. The latter shows were filmed and released as &quot;Genesis Live – The Mama Tour&quot;.

In February 1984, Genesis took a break in activity to allow each member to continue with their solo careers. Rutherford formed his group Mike + The Mechanics, Banks worked on his solo album &quot;Soundtracks&quot; and Collins released &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, which achieved worldwide success and increased his popularity as a result. The music press took note that Collins&#x27;s success as a solo artist made him more popular than Genesis. Before the release of &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, Collins insisted that he would not leave the band. &quot;The next one to leave the band will finish it&quot;, Collins told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in May 1985. &quot;I feel happier with what we&#x27;re doing now, because I feel it&#x27;s closer to me. I won&#x27;t be the one.&quot; He added, &quot;Poor old Genesis does get in the way sometimes. I still won&#x27;t leave the group, but I imagine it will end by mutual consent.&quot; In June, Collins spoke of the band&#x27;s intention to start work on a new album that year, ending rumours to a false announcement that aired on BBC Radio 1 suggesting Genesis had split.

===1985–1996: &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; and Collins&#x27;s departure===
Genesis reconvened at The Farm in October 1985 to start work on &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, which lasted for six months. They continued their method of songwriting used on &quot;Genesis&quot; by developing material from group improvisations. Banks remembered the time as a strong period creatively for the band, with ideas &quot;flowing out of us&quot;. &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; was developed in such a way, when the group were working on &quot;The Last Domino&quot;, the second part of &quot;Domino&quot;. During the session, Rutherford began to play an improvised guitar riff to which Collins replied with an off-the-cuff lyric – &quot;She seems to have an invisible touch&quot; – which became the song&#x27;s chorus hook.

Following its release in June 1986, the album spent three weeks at No. 1 in the UK and reached No. 3 in the US, and became the best-selling Genesis album with seven million copies sold. The album&#x27;s five singles – &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, &quot;Throwing It All Away&quot;, &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;, &quot;In Too Deep&quot; and &quot;Tonight, Tonight, Tonight&quot; – entered the top five on the US singles chart between 1986 and 1987 with &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; topping the chart for one week. Genesis became the first group and foreign act to achieve this feat, equalling the five singles record set by Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson and Madonna. After Collins was parodied by the British satirical television series &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, he commissioned them to make puppets of the band for the video of &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;.
The Invisible Touch Tour was the band&#x27;s largest world tour in its history, which included 112 dates from September 1986 to July 1987. Genesis received some criticism for their decision to have Michelob beer as a sponsor. The tour concluded with four consecutive sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium in London. The shows were released in 1988 as &quot;The Invisible Touch Tour&quot;. When the tour ended, Genesis took a break while each member committed to their solo projects. They performed twice during this time; on 14 May 1988, they performed a 20-minute set at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden. This was followed by a set at a charity gig at the 1990 Knebworth Festival on 30 June, headlined by Pink Floyd.

In 1991 Genesis recorded their fourteenth album, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;, from March to September with their new engineer and co-producer, Nick Davis. The band took advantage of the increased capacity the CD offered and released over 71 minutes of new music across 12 tracks. Collins wrote the lyrics to &quot;Since I Lost You&quot; for his friend Eric Clapton following the death of Clapton&#x27;s four-year-old son Conor. The album was released in November and reached No. 1 in the UK for one week and No. 4 in the US, where it went on to sell over 4 million copies.
The album spawned several hit singles; &quot;No Son of Mine&quot; went to No. 6 in the UK and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; reached No. 7 in the UK and the US. In 1993, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; was nominated for a Brit Award for Best British Album.
The &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; tour visited North America and Europe from May to November 1992 with each concert attended by an average of 56,000 people. The tour spawned two live albums; &quot;The Way We Walk, Volume One: The Shorts&quot; reached No. 3 in the UK and &quot;The Way We Walk, Volume Two: The Longs&quot; went to No. 1 in the UK. A live home video, also titled &quot;The Way We Walk&quot;, documented one of the band&#x27;s six consecutive shows at Earl&#x27;s Court during November 1992. Following the tour, the band took a break in recording and performing activity. Banks, Rutherford and Collins performed at Cowdray Castle, Midhurst in September 1993 for a money-raising event with Pink Floyd touring guitarist Tim Renwick and drummer Gary Wallis and Queen drummer Roger Taylor. Rutherford also played bass on Pink Floyd&#x27;s set at the same concert.

In March 1996, Collins announced his departure from Genesis. In a statement, he said, &quot;Having been in Genesis for 25 years, I felt it time to change direction in my musical life. For me now, it will be music for movies, some jazz projects and of course my solo career. I wish the guys in Genesis all the very best in their future. We remain the best of friends.&quot;

===1996–2006: Wilson as frontman, &quot;Calling All Stations&quot; and hiatus===
Shortly after Banks and Rutherford decided to continue Genesis in 1996, they went to The Farm to start writing &quot;Calling All Stations&quot;. Rutherford initially found the sessions difficult as he saw Collins as &quot;the guy in the middle&quot; who made Banks and himself work better. Their best ideas developed in this period were put forward while they auditioned new singers, including Francis Dunnery and Nick Van Eede. The two main contenders, David Longdon (later of Big Big Train) and Scottish singer Ray Wilson of Stiltskin, auditioned throughout 1996, which involved singing along to Genesis tracks with the lead vocals removed. Wilson was announced as the new Genesis singer in June 1997. Though much of the album was already written by the time he joined, Banks was pleased with his contributions to the album, which included writing the lyrics to &quot;Small Talk&quot; and riffs on &quot;Not About Us&quot; and &quot;There Must Be Some Other Way&quot;. Banks and Rutherford opted for two drummers on &quot;Calling All Stations&quot; – Israeli session musician Nir Zidkyahu and Nick D&#x27;Virgilio of Spock&#x27;s Beard.

&quot;Calling All Stations&quot; was released in September 1997. It was a commercial and critical success in Europe, where it reached No. 2 in the UK, but the album only reached No. 54 in the US, their lowest charting album there since &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;. A single from the album, &quot;Congo&quot; reached the top 30 in the UK and Genesis completed a European tour from January to May 1998, adding Zidkyahu on drums and Irish guitarist Anthony Drennan. A North American concert tour was planned, but it was cancelled following a poor commercial response and lack of ticket sales, which led to Banks and Rutherford announcing in 2000 that the group would no longer be recording and touring.

In 1998, Banks, Collins, Gabriel, Hackett, Phillips, Rutherford and Silver gathered for a photo session and dinner to celebrate the release of the four-disc box set, &quot;Genesis Archive 1967–75&quot;. The set features &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; and &quot;It&quot; with new overdubs by Gabriel and Hackett. In 1999, Banks, Collins, Rutherford, Hackett and Gabriel released a new version of &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; for the compilation album &quot;Turn It On Again: The Hits&quot;. On 21 September 2000, Collins, Banks, Rutherford reunited to perform a brief acoustic set at the Music Managers Forum, in honour of their manager Tony Smith. Gabriel attended the ceremony but chose not to perform with the band. Genesis briefly performed at Gabriel&#x27;s wedding in 2002. In 2004, Genesis released &quot;Platinum Collection&quot;, a three-disc compilation album covering the band&#x27;s career that reached No. 21 in the UK.

===2006–2020: Turn It On Again Tour, BBC documentary and reunion speculation===
In a press conference held in London in November 2006, Banks, Rutherford and Collins announced their reunion for the Turn It On Again Tour, their first with Collins in fourteen years. They revealed the initial plan of touring &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; with Gabriel and Hackett. The five met in Glasgow in November 2004 to discuss the idea further, but it never developed further as Gabriel was unable to commit due to other projects. Instead, Banks, Rutherford and Collins decided to proceed with Chester Thompson and Daryl Stuermer returning on drums and guitar, respectively. In March 2007, a press conference was held in New York City to announce the North American leg.
The Turn It On Again Tour featured a stage designed by architect Mark Fisher with a lighting display by Patrick Woodroffe, included a 55-metre long LED backdrop formed of 9 million LED lights. The European leg saw close to 400,000 tickets sold in 40 minutes for shows in Germany and the Netherlands. The European leg ended with a free concert on 14 July at the Circus Maximus in Rome in front of around half a million people. This was filmed and released on DVD the following year as &quot;When in Rome 2007&quot;. A live album formed of recordings from various European dates was released in 2007 as &quot;Live over Europe 2007&quot;. On 7 July, the band played at the Live Earth concert in London at Wembley Stadium.

The band&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Genesis Chapter &amp; Verse&quot; was published in 2007 as a full colour 359 page hardback book. The writing credits were Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett and Mike Rutherford, edited by Philip Dodd.

In 2007, the band&#x27;s studio albums from &quot;Trespass&quot; to &quot;Calling All Stations&quot; were digitally remastered by Nick Davis across three box sets: &quot;Genesis 1970–1975&quot;, &quot;Genesis 1976–1982&quot; and &quot;Genesis 1983–1998&quot;. Each album is presented as a two-disc set containing a CD/Super Audio CD of a new stereo mix and a DVD with a 5.1 surround sound mix and bonus features including previously unreleased live performances, interviews and concert programmes. Two more box sets followed in 2009, &quot;Genesis Live 1973–2007&quot;, which collected all of the band&#x27;s live albums and &quot;Genesis Movie Box 1981–2007&quot;, which compiled all of the band&#x27;s live home video releases.

After 2011, Genesis members expressed mixed opinions about the possibility of a reunion. Collins retired from the music industry as an active musician during that year in favour of family commitments, and has stated he can no longer play the drums due to medical issues. Hackett has said &quot;I would say it&#x27;s possible, but highly improbable. I&#x27;ve always been open to it. I&#x27;m not the guy who says no.&quot; Gabriel addressed the possibility of a reunion, stating &quot;I never say never. It really didn&#x27;t happen last time. I think there&#x27;s a small chance, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very high.&quot; In 2014, Collins reiterated, &quot;Have people thought it through? It&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;re going to get Peter as the singer, me as the drummer. I can&#x27;t play any more, so it&#x27;s never going to happen&quot;, adding it would not be likely for Gabriel to perform songs on which Collins originally sang lead vocals.

In 2014, Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, Collins and Hackett reunited for &quot;&quot;, a BBC documentary about the band&#x27;s history and the various solo albums the members have released over the course of their careers. Although he participated in the documentary and promoted it, Hackett was very critical following its broadcast, saying that it was biased and did not give him editorial involvement, adding that it ignored his solo work despite his speaking at length about it. The documentary also did not cover Ray Wilson&#x27;s time in Genesis. In 2015, Hackett was doubtful about the idea of a Genesis reunion, saying: &quot;Look at the documentary and you&#x27;ll get an idea of the priorities that come across.&quot;

In 2015, Collins announced an end to his retirement and speculated that a reunion with Banks and Rutherford would be possible, a view that Banks endorsed. In 2017, Rutherford said he was also amenable to a reunion tour if Collins was interested. Hackett said he would like a reunion of Genesis&#x27;s 1971–1975 line-up, but stressed it was very unlikely, adding &quot;I won&#x27;t say any more because I don&#x27;t want to raise expectations.&quot; Collins published his autobiography in 2016 and stated in the introduction that he retired from Genesis in 2007.

===2020–2022: The Last Domino? Tour===
On 23 January 2020, Collins, Banks and Rutherford were spotted together at a basketball game in New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, sparking rumours about a possible Genesis reunion. On 4 March, the trio announced their reformation and The Last Domino? Tour on Zoe Ball&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show. The tour was originally planned for seventeen dates across the UK and Ireland between November and December of the same year, with longtime touring guitarist/bassist Daryl Stuermer and Collins&#x27;s son Nic on drums. Their usual touring drummer, Chester Thompson, was not invited and said he had not spoken to Collins in ten years. The tour was rescheduled twice due to the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, firstly from April 2021 and then from September 2021. Collins asserted that the tour would be his last with Genesis due to his health issues, and said there were no plans for the band to record new music, but added: &quot;Never say never&quot;. A North American leg was later added for November 2021, following the UK leg. The tour was supported with the release of a greatest hits set &quot;The Last Domino? – The Hits&quot;.

The tour began on 20 September 2021. On 8 October, with four dates remaining, the UK leg was postponed due to a positive test for COVID-19 in the band. With the exception of the second Glasgow date, the dates were rescheduled for March 2022, ending with three shows in London on 24–26 March. Genesis performed their final concert of The Last Domino? Tour on 26 March in London. Gabriel was in attendance for the show, but he did not join the band on stage.

In September 2022, Genesis announced that they had sold a portion of their music rights to Concord for an estimated £270 million. The deal includes publishing copyrights and streaming income from their post-1978 output and solo albums by Banks, Rutherford and Collins. Their earnings from the deal with Concord and The Last Domino? Tour made Genesis top a list of highest-paid entertainers of 2022 by &quot;Forbes″&quot; magazine, with $230 million.

On 3 March 2023, the 5 CD live box set &quot;BBC Broadcasts&quot; was released, featuring material originally broadcast between 1970 and 1998.

==Musical style and influences==
Genesis identify first and foremost as songwriters. Though styles changed dramatically over the group&#x27;s career, they were always built on musical contrasts and the willingness to experiment. Bruce Eder of AllMusic described Genesis&#x27; sound as &quot;ambitious, classical-tinged art rock&quot;.

Members of the original line-up were exposed to classical and church music as well as rock artists of the 1960s, particularly the Beatles. Gabriel&#x27;s vocal style was influenced by Otis Redding and other Stax artists. Some of Genesis&#x27;s music was inspired by blues according to Hackett, who says that the sonic innovation of the electric guitar in the early 1970s came straight from this. In their early years, Genesis&#x27; music combined elements of the pop, folk and psychedelic genres. Several songs developed during Phillips&#x27; time in the band originated on 12-string guitars, often with unconventional tunings. By the 1970s, the group began to include fantasy and surreal elements in their lyrics, such as &quot;The Musical Box&quot;. &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; marks the first time electric instruments were used more extensively. &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; marked a return to the band&#x27;s roots with acoustic passages and songs inspired by fantasy.

Early lyrics drew from psychedelia, fantasy, mythological figures and fairytale themes. Gabriel emerged as one of the band&#x27;s main lyricists who often incorporated puns and double entendres in his lines and track titles and addressed various themes including social commentary. &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; contains references to English culture of the time including &quot;Aisle of Plenty&quot;, where four British supermarket chains are referenced to reflect the album&#x27;s theme of commercialism. Literary sources are used as inspiration for many Genesis tracks; &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; is based on T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, and Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; inspired the lyrics to &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;.

By the time the group had slimmed down to the trio of Banks, Rutherford and Collins, they had decided to change lyrical styles, dealing more with everyday matters which connected with female fans. Collins&#x27;s songs, in particular, were personal in nature. The group still featured humour in songs such as &quot;Illegal Alien&quot;, and dealt with serious themes such as politics on &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; and commercialization on &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;. Eder observed that by this point in the band&#x27;s career, &quot;Collins possessed pop instincts that could thrive on mainstream radio and on the emerging MTV.&quot;

Banks said that a common way of developing songs throughout the band&#x27;s career was for Collins to play the rhythm, Rutherford to set up a groove and riffs and for him to add the harmonies and melodies on top. He cited the &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8&quot; section of &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; and &quot;Domino&quot; as examples of this and says the restrictions it gave him allowed the group to produce straightforward pop songs such as &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; and &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; in later years. 

Banks has used a number of keyboards during Genesis&#x27; career, continually trying out new models, though he has used the piano regularly throughout the group&#x27;s lifetime. In the 1970s he frequently used the Hammond organ, Hohner Pianet, Mellotron, RMI Electronic Piano and ARP Pro Soloist. In the 1980s, he used the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 and Prophet 10, the ARP Quadra and various Korg synthesizers. For the Turn It On Again tour in 2007, his main keyboard was a Korg OASYS. As both a guitarist and bassist, Rutherford regularly swapped between the two roles and his trademark instrument with Genesis, particularly throughout the 1970s, was a double-neck guitar. In the 1980s and beyond, he favoured the Eric Clapton Stratocaster.
==Legacy==
Genesis have been estimated to have sold between 100 and 150 million albums worldwide. Their total certified album sales include 21.5 million in the US, 7.2 million in the UK, 5.6 million in Germany, and 3.4 million in France. Genesis have been awarded eleven Gold and four Multi-Platinum albums in the UK, while in the US they have seven Gold, two Platinum and four Multi-Platinum albums.

In March 2010, Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio. The band&#x27;s awards include a Silver Clef Award for outstanding contributions to British music at its second annual ceremony in 1977. In 1988, the band received one of the only two Grammy Awards issued for the short-lived Best Concept Music Video category for &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;. In September 2012, a Lifetime Achievement Award was given to the band at the inaugural Progressive Music Awards. In 2004, &quot;Q&quot; ranked Genesis as the seventeenth-biggest band in a list compiled based on album sales, time spent on the UK charts and largest audience for a headlining show. Genesis were honoured at the second VH1 Rock Honors in May 2007, which featured Banks, Rutherford and Collins. In 2008, the band received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Mojo Awards.

Genesis were targets for criticism throughout the 1970s from those who disliked progressive rock. Influential BBC DJ John Peel championed the band in their early years and they performed three sessions for him between 1970 and 1972, but he &quot;grew disillusioned with their later excesses&quot;. Some regarded the group as overtly middle-class, paying particular attention to the founder members&#x27; private education, and believed rock music was being taken away from the working class, whom they regarded as its core audience. Likening his background to that of the punk artist Joe Strummer, who had become a &quot;people&#x27;s hero&quot; musician, Gabriel stated in 2013, &quot;To this day, we&#x27;ve never outgrown the snotty rich-kid thing ... we were always very straight about where we came from, and we were middle-class, not aristocratic.&quot; Gabriel&#x27;s theatrics were unpalatable to some of the mainstream rock audience, resulting in a cult following rather than that of a mainstream rock band.

At their commercial peak in the 1980s, the music of Genesis faced the accusation of being &quot;flabbergastingly insignificant&quot; by leading American music critic Robert Hilburn, and it has been described as &quot;barely distinguishable&quot; from Collins&#x27;s solo work. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Erik Hedegaard, Collins in particular was blamed by those who accused the band of selling out. Retrospectively, &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; critic J. D. Considine documented how the band had been &quot;largely ignored&quot; by the music press and public in their earliest years, before being &quot;derided as middlebrow throwbacks still in thrall to the pomposities of art rock&quot; in the late 1970s and then dismissed as &quot;easy-listening lightweights&quot; in the 1980s. He argued this was unfair, as the band had made their &quot;share of mediocre albums&quot; but no bad ones. Critics disagree about which albums were mediocre; Considine cites &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; as one of the band&#x27;s three worst (those meriting 2 stars out of 5), while the AllMusic Guide picks it as one of their three best. Banks later reflected, &quot;We never had that definitive album the way Floyd had &quot;The Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; or the Eagles had &quot;Hotel California&quot;. [...] We haven&#x27;t got that universality of somebody like Queen, who everybody likes to some degree. We were considered too fey to be street cred, so some like us, some don&#x27;t.&quot;

Journalists have reported that fans preferring one era of the band strongly dislike others. Rock author Colin McGuire has described the arguments from fans of the Gabriel era as &quot;they sold out and became too corporate when Collins stepped into the spotlight&quot;, while fans of the Collins era argue &quot;the Gabriel years were boring and hard to stomach&quot;. He concluded both eras of the band should be judged on their own merits. The band themselves have been aware of these divides; press interviews for &quot;Abacab&quot; explicitly stated that fans of &quot;Foxtrot&quot; might not like the album, but should keep an open mind. Ultimate Classic Rock stated, &quot;There are few groups in the classic-rock canon with a more divisive discography than Genesis ... there&#x27;s no arguing that they helped create the template for prog-rock and made some of the genre&#x27;s most essential albums&quot;, but continued &quot;the Genesis sound gradually grew less and less progressive, until the band became a straight-up pop act. Good luck finding anybody out there who&#x27;s equally enamored of both sides of the band&#x27;s story.&quot; On their legacy, &quot;Q&quot; reviewer Andy Fyfe wrote in 2007 that &quot;little of the band&#x27;s output has aged well&quot; and &quot;transcends in the way real classics do&quot;, stating they would &quot;remain perennial whipping boys for decades to come&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; chief rock music critic Neil McCormick said that Genesis were &quot;a daring and groundbreaking band (certainly in their early career)&quot;, described Collins as &quot;an outstanding drummer&quot; and stated that &quot;after Gabriel left, he stepped up to prove himself a charismatic frontman with a very distinctive vocal character&quot;.

===Influence===
Genesis have been cited as a principal influence on the neo-prog subgenre that emerged in the 1980s, featuring bands including Marillion and Pallas. Steve Hackett&#x27;s work in Genesis influenced guitarists such as Brian May of Queen, Alex Lifeson of Rush, and Eddie Van Halen of Van Halen. Iron Maiden founder Steve Harris cited Gabriel-era Genesis as one of his main influences, describing &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; (along with Jethro Tull&#x27;s song &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;) as one of his two favourite pieces of music of all time in an interview with &quot;Prog&quot;. Genesis were also an influence on post-punk artists such as Simple Minds and Will Sergeant, guitarist of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, as well as the electronic new wave band the Human League. Trey Anastasio of Phish said, &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to overstate what impact this band and musical philosophy had on me as a young musician. I&#x27;m forever in their debt.&quot; Mostly Autumn &quot;fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd with Celtic themes&quot; in their sound. The alternative rock band Elbow acknowledged Genesis as an influence, such as on their breakthrough song &quot;Newborn&quot;.

There are a number of Genesis tribute bands, including ReGenesis who focus on the group&#x27;s 1970s music. The most successful act is the Canadian band the Musical Box, who have been officially endorsed by the band and had Hackett and Collins perform as guests with them. Gabriel took his children to see the Musical Box so &quot;they could see what their father did back then&quot;, while Hackett said &quot;They not only manage to sound, but look virtually identical&quot;.

<text>Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is a Christian denomination that is an outgrowth of the Bible Student movement founded by Charles Taze Russell in the ninteenth century. The denomination is nontrinitarian, millenarian, and restorationist. Russell co-founded Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881 to organize and print the movement&#x27;s publications. A leadership dispute after Russell&#x27;s death resulted in several groups breaking away, with Joseph Franklin Rutherford retaining control of the Watch Tower Society and its properties. Rutherford made significant organizational and doctrinal changes, including adoption of the name &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses&quot; in 1931 to distinguish the group from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell&#x27;s traditions. In , Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses reported a peak membership of approximately worldwide.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are known for their evangelism, distributing literature such as &quot;The Watchtower&quot; and &quot;Awake!&quot;, and for refusing military service and blood transfusions. They consider the use of God&#x27;s name vital for proper worship. They reject Trinitarianism, inherent immortality of the soul, and hellfire, which they consider unscriptural doctrines. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent, and the establishment of God&#x27;s kingdom over earth is the only solution to all of humanity&#x27;s problems. They do not observe Christmas, Easter, birthdays, or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity. They prefer to use their own Bible translation, the &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures&quot;. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses consider human society morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan, and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses. The denomination is directed by a group known as the Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, which establishes all doctrines. Congregational disciplinary actions include formal expulsion and shunning, for what they consider serious offenses. Members who formally leave are considered to be &quot;disassociated&quot; and are also shunned. Some members who leave voluntarily successfully &quot;fade&quot; without being shunned. Former members may experience significant mental distress as a result of being shunned, and some seek reinstatement to maintain contact with their friends and family.

The group&#x27;s position on conscientious objection to military service and refusal to salute state symbols (for example, national anthems and flags) has brought it into conflict with several governments. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have been persecuted, with their activities banned or restricted in some countries. Persistent legal challenges by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have influenced legislation related to civil rights in several countries. The organization has been criticized regarding biblical translation, doctrines, and alleged coercion of its members. The Watch Tower Society has made various unfulfilled predictions about major biblical events, such as Jesus&#x27; Second Coming, the advent of God&#x27;s kingdom, and Armageddon. Their policies for handling cases of child sexual abuse have been the subject of various formal inquiries.

==Demographics==

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have an active presence in most countries. In , Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses reported approximately &quot;publishers&quot;—the term they use for members actively involved in preaching—in about congregations. In the same year, they conducted Bible studies with individuals (including those conducted by Witness parents with their children). 4,091 members served as missionaries in 2021. In , Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses reported a worldwide annual increase of . people attended the annual memorial of Christ&#x27;s death. According to the Watch Tower Society, more than 25,600 members have died of COVID-19. The official published membership statistics, such as those above, include only those who submit reports for their personal ministry. As a result, only about half of those who self-identify as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in independent demographic studies are considered &quot;active&quot; by the faith itself. Research regarding the demographics of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is incredibly limited; sample sizes tend to be small and focused to a specific region. Cross-cultural studies are &quot;virtually non-existent&quot;.

The 2008 US Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life survey found a low retention rate among members of the denomination: about 37% of people raised in the group continued to identify as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The next lowest retention rates were for Buddhism at 50% and Catholicism at 68%. The study also found that 65% of adult American Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are converts. In 2016, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses had the lowest average household income among surveyed religious groups, with approximately half of Witness households in the United States earning less than $30,000 per year. As of 2016, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were considered to be the most racially diverse Christian denomination in the United States. A sociological comparative study by the Pew Research Center found that American Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses ranked highest in getting no further than high school graduation, belief in God, importance of religion in one&#x27;s life, frequency of religious attendance, frequency of prayers, frequency of Bible reading outside of religious services, belief that their prayers are answered, belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way, belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life, opposition to abortion, and opposition to homosexuality. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses also ranked lowest in interest in politics.

==History==

Scholarly analysis of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is limited in Western academia, with most works focusing on legal challenges faced by the group. The denomination does not cooperate with scholars beyond limited communication from anonymous individuals. Consequently, academics often rely on literature written by former members such as James Penton and Raymond Franz to understand its inner workings. The denomination has been variously described as a &quot;church&quot;, &quot;sect&quot;, &quot;new religious movement&quot;, or &quot;cult&quot;. Usage of the various terms has been debated among sociologists. When the term &quot;sect&quot; is used by sociologists, it is within the framework of church-sect typology for their activities within a specific country. Sociologists from the 1940s to the 1960s frequently compared the group&#x27;s structure with totalitarianism. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, sociologists determined that &quot;cult&quot; was a reductionist label when applied to Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, noting that new members did not undergo &quot;sudden transformations&quot; and made a rational choice to join the group. Academics generally stopped using the term &quot;cult&quot; in the 1980s due to its pejorative association and its usage by the Christian countercult movement, with &quot;new religious movement&quot; largely replacing it. George Chryssides and Zoe Knox avoid using the term &quot;new religious movement&quot; because it also has negative connotations. Chryssides refers to the denomination as an &quot;old new religion&quot;. 

===Background===
In 1870, Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to study the Bible. During his ministry, Russell disputed many of mainstream Christianity&#x27;s tenets, including immortality of the soul, hellfire, predestination, Christ&#x27;s return, the Trinity, and the burning up of the world. In 1876, he met Nelson H. Barbour. Later that year they jointly produced the book &quot;Three Worlds,&quot; which combined restitutionist views with end time prophecy.

The book taught that God&#x27;s dealings with humanity were divided dispensationally, with each period ending with a &quot;harvest&quot;, and that Jesus inaugurated the &quot;harvest of the Gospel age&quot; by means of his invisible return in 1874. The book asserted that 1914 would mark the end of a 2,520-year period called &quot;the Gentile Times&quot;, at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God&#x27;s kingdom on earth. Beginning in 1878, Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious magazine, &quot;Herald of the Morning&quot;. In June 1879, the two split over doctrinal differences, and in July, Russell began publishing the magazine &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ&#x27;s Presence&quot;, saying its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in &quot;the last days&quot; and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under Jesus&#x27; reign was imminent.

From 1879, &quot;Watch Tower&quot; supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible topically. Thirty congregations were founded, and during 1879 and 1880, Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings. In 1881, &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower Tract Society&quot; was presided over by William Henry Conley, and in 1884, Russell incorporated the society as a nonprofit business to distribute tracts and Bibles. He also published a six book series entitled &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;. By about 1900, Russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time colporteurs, and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices. By the 1910s, Russell&#x27;s organization maintained nearly a hundred &quot;pilgrims&quot;, or traveling preachers. Russell engaged in significant global publishing efforts during his ministry, and by 1912, he was the most distributed Christian author in the United States. He also directed &quot;The Photo-Drama of Creation&quot;.

Russell moved the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s headquarters to Brooklyn, New York, in 1909, combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named &quot;Bethel&quot;. He identified the religious movement as &quot;Bible Students&quot;, and more formally as the International Bible Students Association. By 1910, about 50,000 people worldwide were associated with the movement and congregations reelected him annually as their pastor. Russell died on October 31, 1916, at the age of 64 while returning from a ministerial speaking tour.

===Joseph Rutherford===

In January 1917, the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s legal representative, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, was elected as its next president. His election was disputed, and members of the Board of Directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner. The divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade. Because of disappointment over the changes and unfulfilled predictions, tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford&#x27;s tenure, leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society, the largest of which was the Dawn Bible Students Association. There are varying estimates of how many Bible Students left during Rutherford&#x27;s tenure, with Alan Rogerson believing the total number to be unclear. By mid-1919, an estimated one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society. By the 1920s, three-quarters were estimated to have left.

Rutherford enacted several changes under his leadership, many of which are considered &quot;distinctive&quot; to modern Jehovah&#x27;s Witness beliefs and practices. Some of these changes include advocating for door-to-door preaching, prohibiting celebrations believed to be pagan such as Christmas, the belief that Jesus died on a stake instead of a cross, and a more uniform organizational hierarchy. In 1919, Rutherford instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation, and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters. In 1920, he announced that the Hebrew patriarchs (such as Abraham and Isaac) would be resurrected in 1925, marking the beginning of Christ&#x27;s thousand-year earthly kingdom. In July 1917, he released &quot;The Finished Mystery&quot; as a seventh volume to the &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot; series. Rutherford claimed it to be Russell&#x27;s posthumous work, but it was actually written by Clayton Woodworth, George Fisher, and Gertrude Seibert. It strongly criticized Catholic and Protestant clergy and Christian involvement in the Great War. As a result, Watch Tower Society directors were jailed for sedition under the &quot;Espionage Act&quot; in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence; the directors were released in March 1919 and charges against them were dropped in 1920. 

On July 26, 1931, at a convention in Columbus, Ohio, Rutherford introduced the new name &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses&quot;, based on Isaiah 43:10: &quot;Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me&quot; (King James Version). It was adopted by resolution. The name was chosen to distinguish his group of Bible Students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the Society, as well as to symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods. 

In 1932, Rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders. In 1938, he introduced what he called a theocratic organizational system, under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the Brooklyn headquarters. Doctrine regarding life after death also evolved under his tenure. In addition to the preexisting belief that there would be 144,000 people to survive Armageddon and live in heaven to rule over earth with Jesus, a separate class of members, the &quot;great multitude&quot;, was introduced. This group would live in a paradise restored on earth; from 1935, new converts to the movement were considered part of that class. By the mid-1930s, the timing of the beginning of Jesus&#x27; presence, his enthronement as king, and the start of the last days were each moved to 1914. As their interpretations of the Bible evolved, Witness publications decreed that saluting national flags is a form of idolatry, which led to a new outbreak of mob violence and government opposition in various countries.

===Nathan Knorr===
Nathan Knorr was appointed as third president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1942. Knorr organized large international assemblies, instituted new training programs for members, and expanded missionary activity and branch offices worldwide. He also increased the use of explicit instructions guiding Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; lifestyle and conduct as well as a greater use of congregational judicial procedures to enforce a strict moral code. Watch Tower Society literature stopped crediting individual contributors during his tenure, as he believed that recognition should only be given to God. 

Knorr commissioned a new translation of the Bible, the &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures&quot;, the full version of which was released in 1961. Various Bible scholars, including Bruce M. Metzger and MacLean Gilmour, have said that while scholarship is evident in &quot;New World Translation&quot;, its rendering of certain texts is inaccurate and biased in favor of Witness practices and doctrines. Critics of the group such as Edmund C. Gruss and Christian writers such as Ray C. Stedman, Walter Martin, Norman Klann, and Anthony Hoekema say the &quot;New World Translation&quot; is scholastically dishonest. Most criticism of the &quot;New World Translation&quot; relates to its rendering of the New Testament, particularly regarding the introduction of the name &quot;Jehovah&quot; and in passages related to the Trinity doctrine.

The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972. In a major organizational overhaul in 1976, the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished, with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions being passed to the Governing Body. Knorr introduced these changes as he believed that people making spiritual decisions should be &quot;called by Christ&quot; rather than elected. The presidency&#x27;s role transitioned into heading the denomination&#x27;s legal entity. The distinction between these roles grew further when all Governing Body members resigned as directors and the Christian Congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Inc. was formed in 2000. Since Knorr&#x27;s death in 1977, the presidency has been held by Frederick Franz, Milton Henschel, Don Alden Adams and Robert Ciranko.

===Further development===
From 1966, Witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that Jesus&#x27; thousand-year reign might begin in 1975 or shortly thereafter. The number of baptisms increased significantly, from about 59,000 in 1966 to more than 297,000 in 1974. By 1975, the number of active members exceeded two million. From 1971 to 1981, there was a net increase of 737,241 publishers worldwide, while baptisms totaled 1.71 million for the same period. Watch Tower Society literature did not say that 1975 would definitely mark the end, though it was strongly implied. Frederick Franz, then–president of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, stated at a 1975 convention that the great tribulation could be expected to start by the end of that year. Many Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses acted upon this information by quitting their jobs and preaching more fervently. After that prediction failed, ordinary Jehovah&#x27;s Witness members were blamed for believing in the date rather than the Governing Body acknowledging responsibility. Membership declined significantly for a few years after the failed prediction. 

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have not set any specific dates for the end since 1975. Their publications emphasize that &quot;one cannot know the day or the hour&quot;, but they still believe Armageddon to be imminent. Verse 34 of Matthew 24, where Jesus tells his disciples that &quot;this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen&quot;, was interpreted to refer to the generation of people alive in 1914. The initial teaching was that Armageddon would begin before the last person alive during that timeframe had died. The time limit was removed in 1995. This doctrine changed further in 2008, where &quot;generation&quot; was interpreted to refer to both the original anointed class and their remnant, the latter of which would be alive when Armageddon began. In 2010, the meaning of &quot;generation&quot; was re-interpreted to include individuals whose lives overlapped with anointed individuals alive during 1914.

==Organization==
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are organized hierarchically, in what the leadership calls a theocratic organization, reflecting their belief that it is God&#x27;s visible organization on earth. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses establish branch offices to manage their activities in various countries or regions. Each branch office is also referred to as Bethel. Supporting staff live on these properties where they operate as a religious community and administrative unit. Their living expenses and those of other full-time volunteers are covered along with a basic monthly stipend. These volunteers are called Bethelites and are assigned specific tasks such as printing literature or doing laundry. They are allowed to marry but must leave Bethel if they have children. Bethelites are expected to read the Bible cover-to-cover during their first year of service. Consultants are sometimes hired for specialized tasks such as legal advice. Regular Jehovah&#x27;s Witness members are encouraged to visit Bethel as a recreational activity.

Traveling overseers appoint local elders and ministerial servants, while branch offices may appoint regional committees for matters such as Kingdom Hall construction or disaster relief. Each congregation has a body of appointed unpaid male elders and ministerial servants. Elders maintain general responsibility for congregational governance, setting meeting times, selecting speakers and conducting meetings, directing the public preaching work, and creating judicial committees to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases involving sexual misconduct or doctrinal breaches. New elders are appointed by a traveling overseer after recommendation by the existing body of elders. Ministerial servants—appointed in a similar manner as elders—fulfill clerical and attendant duties, but may also teach and conduct meetings. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not use &quot;elder&quot; as a title to signify a formal clergy-laity division, though elders may employ ecclesiastical privilege regarding confession of sins.

Much of the denomination&#x27;s funding is donated, primarily by members. There is no tithing or collection. In 2001 &quot;Newsday&quot; listed the Watch Tower Society as one of New York&#x27;s 40 richest corporations, with revenues exceeding $950 million. In 2016, it ranked eighteenth for donations received by registered charities in Canada at $80 million. From 1969 until 2015, the denomination&#x27;s headquarters were housed in Brooklyn, with plans to completely move its operations to Warwick in 2017. The property was sold to Kushner Companies for $340 million in 2016.

=== Governing Body ===

The denomination is led by the Governing Body—an all-male group that varies in size. The Governing Body directs several committees that are responsible for administrative functions, including publishing, assembly programs and evangelizing activities. Doctrines of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are established by the Governing Body, which assumes responsibility for interpreting and applying scripture. The Governing Body does not issue a single, comprehensive statement of faith, but expresses its doctrinal positions in a variety of ways through publications published by the Watch Tower Society. The publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation, in which God gradually reveals his will and purpose, and that such enlightenment or &quot;new light&quot; results from the application of reason and study. 

Sociologist Andrew Holden&#x27;s ethnographic study of the group concluded that pronouncements of the Governing Body, through Watch Tower Society publications, carry almost as much weight as the Bible. The organization makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to its teachings. Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body, reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of &quot;God&#x27;s organization&quot;. The denomination does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices; members who openly disagree with the group&#x27;s teachings are expelled and shunned.

===Gender roles===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have a complementarian view of women. Only men may hold positions of authority, such as ministerial servant or elder. Women may actively participate in the public preaching work, serve at Bethel, and profess to be members of the 144,000. They are not typically allowed to address the congregation directly. In rare circumstances, women can substitute in certain capacities if there are no eligible men. In these situations, women must wear a head covering if they are performing a teaching role. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that transgender people should live as the gender they were assigned at birth and view gender-affirming surgery as mutilation. Modesty in dress and grooming is frequently emphasized for both men and women.

==Beliefs==

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe their denomination is a restoration of first-century Christianity. They believe that mainstream Christianity departed from true worship over time, that groups such as Cathars attempted to restore some aspects of it, and that the Protestant Reformation &quot;did not go far enough&quot;. Older books published by the Watch Tower Society such as those by Charles Russell and Joseph Rutherford are usually unfamiliar to a modern Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, although some congregations have these publications in their libraries. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses consider the Bible scientifically and historically accurate and reliable and interpret much of it literally, but accept parts of it as symbolic. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are old Earth creationists. The entire Protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired, inerrant word of God. Regular personal Bible reading is frequently recommended. Members are discouraged from formulating doctrines and &quot;private ideas&quot; reached through Bible research independent of Watch Tower Society publications and are cautioned against reading other religious literature. Adherents commonly call their body of beliefs &quot;The Truth&quot;.

===Jehovah===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses emphasize the use of God&#x27;s name, and they prefer the form &quot;Jehovah&quot;—a vocalization of God&#x27;s name based on the Tetragrammaton. They believe that Jehovah is the only true god, the creator of all things, and the &quot;Universal Sovereign&quot;. They believe that all worship should be directed toward him, and that he is not part of a Trinity; consequently, the group places more emphasis on God than on Christ. They believe that the Holy Spirit is God&#x27;s applied power or &quot;active force&quot;, rather than a person. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that they can have a personal relationship with God.

===Jesus===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that Jesus is God&#x27;s only direct creation, that everything else was created through him by means of God&#x27;s power, and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God&#x27;s &quot;only-begotten Son&quot;. As part of their nontrinitarian beliefs, they do not believe that Jesus is God the Son. They do believe that he was the first angel, and is the only archangel. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that Mary conceived Jesus as a virgin but do not believe that she was born free from sin or that she remained a virgin after his birth. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to atone for original sin. They believe that he died on a single upright post rather than a cross, which they regard as a pagan symbol. Accordingly, they do not use the word &quot;crucifixion&quot; when referring to Jesus&#x27; death. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that Jesus was resurrected with a &quot;spirit body&quot;, and that he assumed human form only temporarily after his resurrection. Biblical references to the Michael, Abaddon (Apollyon), and the Word are interpreted as names for Jesus in various roles. Jesus is considered the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity, appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom.

===Life after death===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe death is a state of nonexistence with no consciousness. There is no Hell of fiery torment; Hades and Sheol are understood to refer to the condition of death, termed the &quot;common grave&quot;. They consider the soul a life or a living body that can die. They believe that humanity is in a sinful state, from which release is possible only by means of Jesus&#x27; shed blood as a ransom, or atonement, for humankind&#x27;s sins. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that a &quot;little flock&quot; of 144,000 selected humans go to heaven, but that God will resurrect the majority (the &quot;other sheep&quot;) to a cleansed earth after Armageddon. They interpret Revelation 14:1–5 to mean that the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to exactly 144,000, who will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over earth. They believe that baptism as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness is vital for salvation, and do not recognize baptism from other denominations as valid. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that some people who died before Armageddon will be resurrected, taught the proper way to worship God, and then face a final test at the end of the millennial reign. This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds. At the end of the thousand years, Jesus will hand all authority back to God. Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead humankind. Those who fail will die, along with Satan and his demons. They also believe that those who rejected their beliefs while still alive will not be resurrected.

===Eschatology===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that Satan was originally a perfect angel who developed feelings of self-importance and craved worship. Satan influenced Adam and Eve to disobey God, and humanity subsequently became participants in a challenge involving the competing claims of Jehovah and Satan to universal sovereignty. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that Jesus began to rule invisibly in heaven as king of God&#x27;s kingdom in October 1914 and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth. They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word &quot;parousia&quot;—usually translated as &quot;coming&quot; when referring to Jesus—as &quot;presence&quot;. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that they are the kingdom&#x27;s representatives on earth. They also believe that they must remain separate from human governments, which they consider to be controlled by Satan. The kingdom is viewed as the means by which God will accomplish his original purpose for the earth, transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not currently suggest any specific date for the end of the world, but Watch Tower Society literature has previously made such statements about 1914, 1925 and 1975. These failed predictions were presented as &quot;beyond doubt&quot; and &quot;approved by God&quot;. Some Watch Tower Society publications state that God has used Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet.

A central teaching of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is that the world faces imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ. This belief has been present since the group&#x27;s founding. They believe that Jesus&#x27; inauguration as king in 1914 is a sign that the great tribulation is about to take place. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that all other present-day religions are false, identifying them with Babylon the Great, the &quot;harlot&quot; of Revelation 17. They believe that Nebuchadnezzar II had a dream where he saw a statue with a gold head, silver chest and arms, copper abdomen, iron legs, and feet that were a mixture of clay and iron. This dream is interpreted as a prophecy representing the rise and fall of empires: gold represents Babylon, silver represents Persia, copper represents Greece, iron represents Rome, and clay represents an Anglo-American empire. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that humanity is currently living in the last empire that will eventually be destroyed by the United Nations, which is also interpreted as the scarlet-colored wild beast. Satan will subsequently use world governments to attack Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, which will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon, during which all forms of human government will be destroyed and all people not counted as Jesus&#x27; sheep will be killed. After Armageddon, God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth, which will be transformed into a paradise like the Garden of Eden. They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the &quot;second coming&quot; of Matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans.

===Family life===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that dating should only occur if the couple is seriously considering marriage. Dating outside the denomination is strongly discouraged and can lead to religious sanctions. Some Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses remain single by choice, while others wish to be in a relationship but have a lack of options. Dating Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are encouraged to have a chaperone when they are together to avoid acting on sexual desires. All sexual relations outside marriage are grounds for expulsion if the person is not deemed repentant; homosexual activity is considered a serious sin, and same-sex marriage is forbidden. Masturbation is also prohibited.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses may get married at a Kingdom Hall in a simple ceremony and practices considered pagan such as wishing good luck or throwing rice are prohibited. An elder will give a talk to the congregation. Once married, a husband is considered to have spiritual headship over his wife, unless he is not one of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Contraception is allowed. Divorce is forbidden if not sought on the grounds of adultery, which is called a &quot;scriptural divorce&quot;. If a divorce is obtained for any other reason, remarriage is considered adulterous unless the former spouse has died or is considered to have committed sexual immorality. Spouses may separate in cases of domestic violence. Jehovah&#x27;s Witness households are expected to have a family worship session each week.

==Practices==
=== Baptism ===
Baptism is considered a requirement for salvation. Baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid. Before being baptized, a member will become an unbaptized publisher. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not practice infant baptism but allow children to be baptized as long as they meet the same requirements as other candidates. To qualify for baptism, an individual must correctly answer more than a hundred questions about their own lifestyle and the denomination&#x27;s beliefs. Individuals undergoing baptism are directed to affirm publicly that their dedication and baptism identifies each &quot;as one of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in association with God&#x27;s spirit-directed organization,&quot; though Witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to God and not &quot;to a man, work or organization.&quot;

===Worship===
Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose &quot;territory&quot; they usually reside and attend weekly services they call &quot;meetings&quot;, scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have &quot;considerable worldwide uniformity&quot;, as all congregations study the same materials on a schedule. Outsiders are encouraged to attend. 

Historically, congregations met three times each week, but since 2009 meet for two sessions each week: one on a weekday and one on a weekend. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are expected to study the assigned material before attending. Children also attend meetings and do not have separate arrangements such as Sunday School. Gatherings are opened and closed with hymns called Kingdom songs and brief prayers. A Kingdom Hall may have multiple congregations that share the building. In 2014, decisions about which congregations would share a Kingdom Hall or whether additional Kingdom Halls should be built was transferred from individual congregations to the nearest branch office. After this change, many Kingdom Halls were sold.

Twice each year, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a &quot;circuit&quot; gather for a one-day assembly. Larger groups of congregations meet annually for a three-day &quot;regional convention&quot;, usually at an Assembly Hall built for this purpose. Rented stadiums or auditoriums are sometimes used instead. New members are baptized at these conventions. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses consider their most important annual event to be the Memorial, which is observed on the fourteenth day of the Jewish month Nisan during Passover, and members advertise the event to outsiders. Unleavened bread and red wine is passed between attendees, but only those who consider themselves to be anointed partake (often with no one in attendance partaking), and a talk is given about the event&#x27;s significance.

===Evangelism===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are known for their efforts to spread their beliefs, distributing Watch Tower Society literature. The objective is to start a regular &quot;Bible study&quot; with anyone who is not already a member, with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group; members are advised to consider discontinuing Bible study with students who show no interest in becoming members. While Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are well known for visiting people&#x27;s homes, they have a variety of preaching methods. Literature carts were introduced in 2012, where Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses stay in a public place and wait for other people to approach them. Methods usually undertaken by those physically unable to engage in the door-to-door ministry include calling people by phone and writing letters. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are sometimes confused with Mormon missionaries. Converts as a result of their door-to-door evangelism are rare and happen at a rate comparable with other denominations that practice similar preaching methods.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are taught that they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching and often do so by working in pairs. They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry, and to submit a monthly &quot;Field Service Report&quot;. Those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed &quot;inactive&quot;. Children also preach. Until 2023, every active Jehovah&#x27;s Witness was expected to submit the amount of hours they spent preaching in their monthly field service report. In November 2023, this requirement was modified to only apply to members who have agreed to a specific hour requirement. As of 2025, auxiliary pioneers preach for 30 hours, regular pioneers preach for 50 hours per month; special pioneers preach for 100 hours each month, often in remote or under-represented areas, and receive a stipend to help pay for their living expenses. Other members are only required to indicate they engaged in some form of ministry during the month, along with any Bible studies they conducted. In , Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses conducted about Bible studies (including studies conducted with their own children), and approximately new members were baptized.

The denomination produces a significant amount of literature as part of its evangelism activities. In 2010, &quot;The Watchtower&quot; and &quot;Awake!&quot; were the world&#x27;s most widely distributed magazines. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses consider their literature to be &quot;spiritual food&quot; and provide it to interested parties for free. The group launched its first website in 1997: watchtower.org. In 2008, it was replaced with jw.org. Their website is often referenced in their evangelism, with its logo appearing in literature displays and outside Kingdom Halls. An increased reliance on electronic media has reduced their printing costs. The denomination archives most of its literature online, although certain entries have been changed after publication. It also offers a streaming service called JW Broadcasting. An animated series aimed at children has been produced called &quot;Become Jehovah&#x27;s Friend&quot;. An application, JW Language, has been designed to facilitate preaching with people who speak different languages. A specialized device for use in areas with limited internet access offers downloaded materials relevant to Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

===Disciplinary action===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses require individuals to be baptized by the denomination in order to be subject to their disciplinary procedures. The denomination does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices; members who openly disagree with the group&#x27;s teachings are expelled, shunned, and condemned as apostates who are &quot;mentally diseased&quot;. Some adherents &quot;fade&quot; and stop attending meetings without being formally subjected to the group&#x27;s disciplinary procedures, although some former members have still experienced shunning through this method.

Members accused of persistent wrongdoing are brought to the attention of the elders who will then evaluate possible consequences. Members that have violated the group&#x27;s standards—for example, dating a non-member—but not otherwise committed a serious sin may be &quot;marked&quot;. Congregation members who are aware of another member&#x27;s errant behaviour are advised to limit social contact with the marked individual. Elders may decide to form a committee in cases involving serious sin, which may result in the member being reproved or shunned. This process requires three elders to meet with the accused. These cases usually involve sexual misconduct or apostasy. Other serious sins involve accepting blood transfusions (which does not require a judicial committee), smoking, using recreational drugs, divorce (unless a spouse committed adultery), celebration of holidays or birthdays, abortion (which is considered murder), and political activities such as voting in elections. Procedures related to congregational discipline are primarily described in the book, &quot;Shepherd the Flock of God&quot;, provided only to elders. People who formally leave Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are considered to be &quot;disassociated&quot; and are also shunned. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses can also be disassociated for accepting a blood transfusion.

The practice of shunning may serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Shunning also helps maintain a &quot;uniformity of belief&quot;. Shunned individuals may experience suicide ideation and often struggle with feelings of low self esteem, shame, and guilt. Former members may also experience ambiguous loss or panic attacks. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by congregation elders, and some seek reinstatement to maintain contact with their friends and family. Reinstatement can be a long process, which may be mentally and emotionally draining. Funerals for expelled members may not be performed at Kingdom Halls.

Baptized children are also subject to the same moral standards and consequences for failing to comply. They are allowed to stay with their families until reaching the age of majority. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses lost state funding as a religious community in Norway because of its shunning policy, with the country concluding that shunning, particularly of children, constitutes psychological violence. Subsequently, the group made some changes to its shunning policy in 2024; individuals may offer &quot;simple greetings&quot; to shunned members instead of completely avoiding them if the individual is not deemed to be an apostate. As of 2024, two elders may have a more informal meeting with a minor who is considered to have committed a &quot;serious sin&quot; along with his or her parents before deciding whether a formal committee meeting is required. Parents are also no longer prohibited from attending judicial committees with minors.

===Separateness===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns mixing religions, on the basis that there can only be one truth from God, and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements. They believe that only Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses represent true Christianity and that other denominations do not meet God&#x27;s requirements; all other Christian denominations (collectively referred to as &quot;Christendom&quot;) along with all other religions are considered &quot;false religion&quot;. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain &quot;separate from the world.&quot; Their literature defines the &quot;world&quot; as &quot;the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah&#x27;s approved servants&quot; and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are taught that association with &quot;worldly&quot; people presents a danger to their faith. Attending university is discouraged and trade schools are suggested as an alternative. Post-secondary education is considered &quot;spiritually dangerous&quot;. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter, nor do they observe birthdays, national holidays, or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than Jesus. They believe that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect nationalistic spirit. Members are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations. Wedding anniversaries are allowed. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are not permitted to work in industries associated with the military and refuse national military service, which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment. They also refuse to salute flags or participate in patriotic activities. Adherents see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties. 

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are often viewed as being without agency or brainwashed by the anti-cult movement. Andrew Holden believes that most members who join millenarian movements such as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have made an informed choice, but that defectors &quot;are seldom allowed a dignified exit&quot;, and describes the administration as autocratic. Rodney Stark believes that Jehovah&#x27;s Witness leaders are &quot;not always very democratic&quot; and that members &quot;are expected to conform to rather strict standards,&quot; but adds that &quot;enforcement tends to be very informal, sustained by the close bonds of friendship within the group&quot;, and that members see themselves as &quot;part of the power structure rather than subject to it.&quot; 

After the publication of &quot;The Elementary Forms of New Religious Life&quot;, academics began to describe various new religious movements as either &quot;world-affirming&quot;, &quot;world-accommodating&quot;, or &quot;world-rejecting&quot;. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were labelled as &quot;world-rejecting&quot;. Bryan R. Wilson believed that Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses conflict with society at large, impose &quot;tests of merit on would-be members&quot;, have strict disciplinary procedures, and expect absolute commitment. Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested that the group&#x27;s intellectual and organizational isolation, coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents, rigid internal discipline, and considerable persecution, has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message.

Alan Rogerson describes the group&#x27;s leadership as totalitarian, while historian rejects this interpretation. James A. Beckford classified the group&#x27;s organizational structure as &quot;totalizing&quot;, with assertive leadership, specific and narrow objectives, control over competing demands on members&#x27; time and energy, and control over the quality of new members. Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities, reluctance to cooperate with other religious organizations, a high rate of membership turnover, a low rate of doctrinal change, and strict uniformity of beliefs among members. Beckford also identified the group&#x27;s chief characteristics as &quot;historicism&quot; (identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God&#x27;s purpose), &quot;absolutism&quot; (conviction that Jehovah&#x27;s Witness leaders dispense absolute truth), &quot;activism&quot; (capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks), &quot;rationalism&quot; (conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery), &quot;authoritarianism&quot; (rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism) and &quot;world indifference&quot; (rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments). 

Former members Heather Botting and Gary Botting compare the cultural paradigms of the denomination to George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Critics believe that by disparaging individual decision-making, the group&#x27;s leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which members abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives. Critics also accuse the group&#x27;s leaders of exercising &quot;intellectual dominance&quot; over adherents, controlling information, and creating &quot;mental isolation&quot;, which former Governing Body member Raymond Franz argued were all elements of mind control. Some Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses describe themselves to academics as &quot;Physically In, Mentally Out&quot; (PIMO); these individuals privately question certain doctrine but remain inside the organization to maintain contact with their friends and family.

===Rejection of blood transfusions===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses typically refuse blood transfusions, which they consider a violation of God&#x27;s law based on their interpretation of Acts 15:28, 29 and other scriptures. This prohibition has existed since 1945. They also do not eat blood-based foods, such as blood sausage. Since 1961, acceptance of a blood transfusion without subsequent repentance has been grounds for expulsion from the group. Members are directed to refuse blood transfusions, even in &quot;a life-or-death situation&quot;. Their literature implies that there is a blood alternative for every medical situation and &quot;emphasizes the danger of blood transfusions&quot;. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not accept the transfusion of &quot;whole blood, packed red cells, platelets, white cells or plasma&quot;. Autologous blood donation, where one&#x27;s blood is stored for later use, is also considered unacceptable. Members may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion. Some Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses may accept prohibited blood products if medical confidentiality is upheld, although Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses who work in a hospital may break such confidentiality. Jehovah&#x27;s Witness patients are generally open to non-blood alternative treatments, even if they are less effective.

Courts have intervened in life-threatening situations involving children that require blood transfusions to allow the treatment to take place. Courts may allow mature minors to reject blood transfusions based on their beliefs. The May 22, 1994 issue of &quot;Awake!&quot; entitled &quot;Youths Who Put God First&quot; featured children who died from refusing blood transfusions.

The Watch Tower Society provides pre-formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components, in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will accept. The denomination has established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah&#x27;s Witness members and medical professionals and hospitals to provide information about bloodless treatment options. Patients who accept certain blood products in the committee&#x27;s presence are deemed to have disassociated and are shunned. The National Secular Society advocates against hospitals partnering with hospital liaison committees due to medical coercion.

===Handling of sexual abuse cases===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. When investigating cases of child abuse, elders are instructed to immediately call the organization&#x27;s headquarters or branch office. The group states that this requirement is to ensure compliance with the law. An investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation determined that elders were asked questions such as, &quot;How many elders believe the victim is to blame or willingly participated in the act?&quot; Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have been criticized for the &quot;two witness rule&quot; for congregational discipline, based on an application of scriptures in Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15–17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s instruction is that &quot;the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah&#x27;s hands&quot;. A former member has said that the policy effectively requires that there be third-party witness to an act of molestation, &quot;which is an impossibility&quot;. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses maintain a database of confidential files in regards to child abuse, which are marked as &quot;Do Not Destroy&quot;. An elder in New Zealand was tasked with destroying &quot;personal notes&quot; in their database when the organization was under investigation for child abuse. In the United States, the group was fined four thousand dollars daily (accruing a total of two million dollars) for delaying an order to provide its documentation.

The group&#x27;s failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized. The Watch Tower Society&#x27;s policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so, but otherwise leave that up to the victim and their family. In jursidictions with priest–penitent privilege, confessions of abuse may be considered confidential. William Bowen, a former Jehovah&#x27;s Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims in the denomination, has claimed that Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities. Other critics have alleged that the organization is reluctant to alert authorities to protect its &quot;crime-free&quot; reputation. However, in response to the charge that their policies &quot;protect pedophiles rather than protect the children&quot;, the organization has maintained that the best way to protect children is to educate parents; they also say they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents. In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States, the Watch Tower Society has been found negligent in its protection of children from known sex offenders within the congregation. The Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court, paying $780,000 in one case. In 2015, the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that &quot;there was no evidence before the Royal Commission of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witness organisation having or not having reported to police any of the 1,006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the organisation since 1950.&quot; The Royal Commission also found that the Watch Tower Society legal department routinely provided incorrect information to elders based on an incorrect understanding of what constitutes a legal obligation to report crimes in Australia. In 2017, the Charity Commission for England and Wales began an inquiry into Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; handling of allegations of child sexual abuse in the United Kingdom. In 2021, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in Australia agreed to join the nation&#x27;s redress scheme for sexual assault survivors to maintain its charity status there. 

== Government interactions ==
Controversy about various beliefs, doctrines and practices of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses has led to opposition from governments, communities, and other religious groups. Religious commentator Ken Jubber wrote, &quot;Viewed globally, this persecution has been so persistent and of such intensity that it would not be inaccurate to regard Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses as the most persecuted group of Christians of the twentieth century.&quot; Several cases involving Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have been heard by Supreme Courts worldwide. They generally relate to the right to practice their religion, displays of patriotism and military service, and blood transfusions. Cases in their favor have been heard in the United States, Canada and many European countries.

Political and religious animosity toward Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries. Their political neutrality and refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during World War II and other periods of compulsory national service, especially in countries that do not provide religious exemptions. Their religious activities are banned or restricted in some countries, including China, Russia, Vietnam, and many Muslim-majority countries.

=== Australia ===
In 1931, the Australian government monitored radio broadcasts of Rutherford&#x27;s sermons as they had received complaints about anti-Catholic rhetoric. The religious group became especially unpopular after 1940 due to their political neutrality in the second world war, prompting people to write to government officials about the names and addresses of known members. In 1941, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses became an illegal organization. Various groups supported the ban, which caused political pressure to enforce it; Member of Parliament Maurice Blackburn opposed a ban, believing it to be caused by religious intolerance. Once the ban was enacted, the assets of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society were seized by the government. Witness homes were raided to confiscate their religious literature. Despite these measures, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses continued their activities. The ban was overturned in 1943 when the High Court concluded that these restrictions violated the constitution.

=== Canada ===

In the early 1900s, radio stations were operated by individual congregations in Saskatoon, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Toronto. In 1927, Arthur Cardin revoked the licenses for these radio stations because they shared airspace with the Ku Klux Klan in Canada. According to Gary Botting, this &quot;strange alliance&quot; was formed due to a mutual opposition against the Roman Catholic church. In response, Rutherford bought airtime from other radio stations. When Hector Charlesworth banned this activity as well, he was &quot;indirectly attacked&quot; in an issue of the &quot;Golden Age&quot; and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses launched a petition to regain their licenses that resulted in 406,270 signatures. Charlesworth&#x27;s actions were debated by the House of Commons in 1933. While multiple members expressed concern that this prohibition was censorship of free speech, the ban was not lifted.

In 1940, a year after Canada entered World War II, the denomination itself was banned under the War Measures Act as a subversive organization. This ban continued until 1943. A separate ban on the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society was not lifted until 1945. More than 100,000 dollars in assets were seized by the Canadian government and tonnes of literature produced by the group were confiscated. Hundreds of adherents were prosecuted as members of an illegal organization. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Chinese and Japanese descent. During this period, many Jehovah&#x27;s Witness children were expelled from school, while others were placed in foster homes or juvenile detention. After the ban was lifted, men who had been jailed tried to apply for the ordained minister exemption of the &quot;National Selective Service Mobilization Regulations&quot; without success. This led to a legal case being filed, &quot;R. v. Stewart&quot;, which ruled that Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were participants in a &quot;commercial undertaking&quot; and did not qualify as ministers. A similar outcome was reached in &quot;Greenlees v. A.G. Canada&quot;, where the judge decided that Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses could not be ministers because they considered every member to be one and that they did not have an organizational structure independent of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses faced discrimination in Quebec until the Quiet Revolution, including bans on distributing literature or holding meetings. &quot;Roncarelli v Duplessis&quot; was a 1959 legal case heard by the Supreme Court of Canada. The court held that in 1946 Maurice Duplessis, Premier and Attorney General of Quebec, had overstepped his authority by ordering the manager of the Liquor Commission to revoke the liquor licence of Frank Roncarelli, a Montreal restaurant owner and Jehovah&#x27;s Witness who was an outspoken critic of the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec. Roncarelli provided bail for Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses arrested for distributing pamphlets attacking the Roman Catholic Church. The Supreme Court found Duplessis liable for $33,000 in damages plus Roncarelli&#x27;s court costs. Another legal case heard that year was &quot;Lamb v Benoit&quot;, where a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness woman was arrested for distributing religious pamphlets.

=== China ===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are banned in China. Missionaries like Amber Scorah were sent there to preach clandestinely.

=== Eritrea ===
Religious groups must be registered in order to legally worship in Eritrea. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, as well as other Christian and Muslim groups, have been refused this legal recognition. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have been imprisoned for their refusal to perform military service and for attending religious services.

=== France ===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were officially registered as a religious group in France in 1947. In 1995, they were designated as a &quot;dangerous sect&quot; by French law. In 1999, the country demanded back taxes on donations to the religious group&#x27;s organization from 1993 and 1996, which would have been €57.5 million. This tax ruling was overturned by the European Court of Human Rights on June 30, 2011.

=== Germany ===

In 1933, there were approximately 20,000 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in Nazi Germany, of whom about 10,000 were imprisoned. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses suffered religious persecution by the Nazis because they refused military service and allegiance to Hitler&#x27;s National Socialist Party. Of those, 2,000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1,200 died, including 250 who were executed. They were hanged, beheaded, beaten to death, or shot dead. Conditions for Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses improved in 1942, when they were increasingly given work details that required little supervision, such as farming, gardening, transportation and unloading goods, while others worked in civilian clothing in a health resort, as housekeepers for Nazi officials, or were given construction and craft tasks at military buildings.

Unlike Jews and Romani, who were persecuted on the basis of their ethnicity, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses could escape persecution and personal harm by signing a document indicating renunciation of their faith, submission to state authority, and support of the German military. Historian Sybil Milton writes, &quot;their courage and defiance in the face of torture and death punctures the myth of a monolithic Nazi state ruling over docile and submissive subjects.&quot; Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses would preach inside the concentration camps, hold meetings, and smuggle in their religious literature.

Approximately 800 children of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were taken away from their families. Witness children typically expressed defiance to the Nazi regime&#x27;s attempts to make them act against their beliefs. They were often expelled from public schools due to their refusal to say &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. Some children were sent to reeducation centers, while others were adopted by families in good standing with the Nazi regime.

In East Germany, from the 1950s to the 1980s, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were persecuted extensively by the Stasi, which frequently used decomposition methods against them. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were considered a threat because their beliefs did not conform to socialist standards and their members sometimes had contact with the West.

In 2023, there was a mass shooting in Hamburg that targeted Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, killing six people. Police were warned about the shooter ahead of time, but failed to take action.

=== Greece ===
Greece had a ban on public evangelism in the 1930s. Approximately 60 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were imprisoned for violating this law. The case was eventually appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, who ruled in favour of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in 1993. This decision also benefited other religious groups in the country. 

=== Japan ===
In Japan, following the publication of &quot;Shūkyō nisei&quot;-related guidelines, a survey was conducted about child abuse within Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, the results of which were forwarded to the government. Ninety-two percent of 583 respondents reported that they had experienced physical abuse as children. The lawyer&#x27;s group conducting the survey believed this to be evidence of systemic religious abuse.

=== Norway ===
Norway provides state subsidies to religious communities, with some restrictions. Although Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses qualified for more than thirty years, they did not receive this funding in Oslo and Viken in 2022. The decision was appealed and upheld by the Ministry of Children and Families. In 2023, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were fully deregistered as a religious community in Norway as a result of their shunning practice. The Supreme Court ruled that religious communities can determine who can be members but that restrictions on additional funding are acceptable. Therefore, the organization no longer receives 1.3 million euros each year in state subsidies. The denomination&#x27;s deregistration also means that they lost the right to perform civil marriages. The director of Human Rights Without Frontiers believes that by deregistering Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Norway is interfering with the group&#x27;s religious freedom.

=== Russia ===

In April 1951, about 9,300 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the Soviet Union were deported to Siberia as part of Operation North.

In April 2017, the Supreme Court of Russia labeled Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses an extremist organization, banned its activities in Russia, and issued an order to confiscate its assets.

=== Singapore ===

In 1941, all publications by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania were banned, as a result of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; persistent refusal to enlist in the Allied Forces in World War II. In 1960, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were officially registered as a society under the Societies Ordinance Act of 1890. In 1972, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were deregistered for being &quot;prejudicial to public welfare and order&quot;, with their refusal to take part in mandatory military service being cited as an aggravating factor. Since their deregistration, all Witnesses who refuse to serve in the military—around six men annually—have faced imprisonment under the Enlistment Act 1970, but none of these men have incurred permanent criminal records .

=== South Korea ===
South Korea did not have a religious exemption for military service until 2018, which led to more than 19,000 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses being imprisoned there.

=== United States ===

In the United States, legal challenges by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties. Among the rights strengthened by Witness court victories in the US are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference, the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service, the right of patients to refuse medical treatment, and the right to engage in public discourse. Authors including William Whalen, Shawn Francis Peters and former members Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, Alan Rogerson, and William Schnell have claimed the arrests and mob violence in the 1930s and 1940s were the consequence of what appeared to be a deliberate course of provocation of authorities and other religious groups by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Harrison, Schnell, and Whalen have suggested Rutherford invited and cultivated opposition for publicity purposes in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society, and to convince members that persecution by the outside world was evidence of the truth of their struggle to serve God.

In 1943, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot; that requiring students to salute the flag was a violation of their First Amendment rights.

<text>Nils Daniel Carl Bildt (born 15 July 1949) is a Swedish politician and diplomat who served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1991 to 1994. He led the Moderate Party from 1986 to 1999, appearing at its lead candidate in four general elections, before his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt from 2006 to 2014. Bildt first entered the Riksdag in 1979, holding a seat until 2001. A member of the Bildt family, he is a great-great grandson of Baron Gillis Bildt, who was Prime Minister of Sweden from 1888 to 1889.

Bildt had been noted internationally as a mediator in the Yugoslav wars, serving as the European Union&#x27;s Special Envoy to the Former Yugoslavia from June 1995, co-chairman of the Dayton Peace Conference in November 1995 and High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from December 1995 to June 1997, immediately after the Bosnian War. From 1999 to 2001, he served as the United Nations Secretary-General&#x27;s Special Envoy for the Balkans. Since 2021, Bildt also has been the World Health Organization&#x27;s Special Envoy for the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT Accelerator).

==Early life and education==

Bildt was born on 15 July 1949 in Halmstad, Halland, to an old Danish-Norwegian-Swedish noble family, the Bildt family, traditionally domiciled in Bohuslän. His grandfather&#x27;s grandfather, Gillis Bildt, was a Conservative politician and diplomat, long-time Ambassador to the German Empire and Prime Minister of Sweden 1888–1889, mainly remembered for his protectionist trade policies.

Bildt&#x27;s father Daniel Bildt (1920–2010) was a major in the reserves of the now defunct Halland Regiment and a bureau director in the now defunct Civil Defense Board&#x27;s Education Bureau. Daniel Bildt married Kerstin Andersson-Alwå in 1947. Carl Bildt&#x27;s brother, Nils, was born in 1952. Bildt was married to Kerstin Zetterberg from 1974 to 1975; to Mia Bohman (daughter of former Moderate party leader and Minister of Economy, Gösta Bohman) from 1984 to 1997; and, since 1998, to Anna Maria Corazza. Bildt has three children; two from his second marriage and one from his third marriage.

Bildt attended Stockholm University.

==Early career==

In May 1968, Bildt opposed the occupation of the Student Union Building by leftist political forces and co-founded the Borgerliga Studenter – Opposition &#x27;68 group which went on to win the Student Union elections in Stockholm for a number of years. He served as chairman of the FMSF Confederation of Swedish Conservative and Liberal Students, a centre-right student organisation, in the early 1970s, and also chaired European Democrat Students, bringing together like-minded centre-right student organisations from across Europe.

When the non-socialist formed government in 1976, Bildt served as the head of the Policy Coordinating Office in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and close collaborator to the party leader and Minister of Economy Gösta Bohman. Bildt became a Member of Parliament in 1979, although he served instead as State Secretary for Policy Coordination in the reformed non-socialist government after that election.

As an MP in the early eighties, he became noted as an incisive and combative debater on foreign affairs. He was a member of the Submarine Defence Commission investigating the 1982 incursions of foreign submarines in the Stockholm archipelago and naval base areas, and often found himself pitted against prime minister Olof Palme. Bildt was elected leader of the Moderate Party in 1986, succeeding Ulf Adelsohn.

In 1991, the Social Democrats were defeated by a four-party coalition led by Bildt&#x27;s Moderate Party.

==Prime minister==

On 4 October 1991, Bildt became the first conservative prime minister in Sweden in 61 years, leading a four-party coalition government. The policies of his government aimed at giving Sweden a &quot;new start&quot; in the middle of a rapidly mounting economic crisis caused by a speculation bubble in housing, focusing on privatising and de-regulating the economy in order to improve the conditions for businesses.

Long a champion of European integration and Sweden&#x27;s participation in this, negotiating membership in the European Union was a priority for the Bildt premiership. The preceding Social Democratic government had, as part of an emergency economic crisis package in the autumn of 1990, done a sudden U-turn, abandoned its previous opposition and in the summer of 1991 submitted a formal application for membership in the EU.

Benefiting also from his close links with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bildt was able to initiate and conclude membership negotiations with the EU in record time, signing the Treaty of Accession at the EU summit in Corfu on 23 June 1994. The accession was supported by a referendum in November, and Sweden entered the EU as full member on 1 January 1995, thus fulfilling a key part of the platform of the Bildt government.

By that time his governing coalition had lost its majority in the September 1994 elections, in spite of his Moderate party making slight gains.

The economic program of the government was focused primarily on a series of structural reforms aiming at improving competitiveness and improving growth. Economic reforms were enacted, including voucher schools, liberalizing markets for telecommunications and energy, privatizing publicly owned companies and health care, contributing to substantially liberalizing the Swedish economy.

These reforms were highly controversial at the time, and the government also had to deal with a rapid increase in unemployment as well as public deficits during 1991 and 1992. The period was marked by a severe economic crisis. These problems were reinforced by the economic crisis in other European countries and the crisis within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. As a result, Sweden in November 1992 was forced to abandon its policy of a fixed exchange rate and allow the Swedish crown to float freely. As part of the effort to handle the economic crisis, the government was able to conclude an agreement with the Social Democratic opposition on some of its expenditure-cutting measures.

By 1994 the economy was registering strong growth, and the deficits were declining, although unemployment was still at levels higher than in 1991.

Prior to becoming prime minister, Bildt had been severely anti-Soviet Union and a strong supporter of the three Baltic nations, and during his period as PM devoted considerable efforts to trying to assist the three newly-independent Baltic states in handling their immediate challenges in the form of the withdrawal of ex-Soviet forces and strategic installations, as well as deciding on sensitive issues of citizenship. In this he worked closely together with the leaders of the three countries as well as with the Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev.

His government also had to handle a large increase in refugee flows from primarily the war in Bosnia, defending a liberal approach against the anti-immigration New Democracy party that had entered parliament in 1991.

Bildt was an early champion of the Internet and information technologies. He led the first IT Commission in 1994, and in that year also had the first exchange of emails between two heads of government with US President Bill Clinton, sending Clinton the following email:Dear Bill,

Apart from testing this connection on the global Internet system, I want to congratulate you on your decision to end the trade embargo on Vietnam. I am planning to go to Vietnam in April and will certainly use the occasion to take up the question of the MIA&#x27;s. From the Swedish side we have tried to be helpful on this issue in the past, and we will continue to use the contacts we might have.

Sweden is—as you know—one of the leading countries in the world in the field of telecommunications, and it is only appropriate that we should be among the first to use the Internet also for political contacts and communications around the globe.

Yours,

CARLIn the same year, Bildt established and chaired an IT Commission to introduce digital initiatives in Sweden while at the same time the government donated 1 billion SEK to create the Knowledge Foundation.

In 1992, he had the reform of private schools under contract and the abolition of the school map adopted, reforms that favored the privatization of education.

The government&#x27;s effectiveness was sometimes hampered by in-fighting, most memorably over the construction of the Øresund Bridge, which led to the departure of the leader of the Centre Party Olof Johansson from the government, paving the way for the government to take the decision to approve the construction of the link.

Bildt continued to serve as leader of the Moderate party – and thus of the opposition – until 1999, when he was succeeded as party leader by Bo Lundgren.

==Balkan conflict==

After his term as prime minister, Bildt was active as a mediator in the Balkans conflict, serving as the European Union Special Envoy to Former Yugoslavia from June 1995, co-chairman of the Dayton Peace Conference that led to the Dayton Peace Accords in November 1995, and High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from December 1995 to June 1997 immediately after the Bosnian War. From 1999 to 2001, he served as the United Nations Secretary General&#x27;s Special Envoy for the Balkans.

Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, without the approval of the UN Security Council, and Sweden recognised it on 4 March 2008. On 8 March 2008, Bildt became the first foreign minister to officially visit Kosovo after it declared its independence.

==Minister for Foreign Affairs==

On 6 October 2006, Bildt was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the newly formed cabinet of Fredrik Reinfeldt. This was seen by many as a surprising move. Not only had Bildt already served both as prime minister and as leader of the Moderate Party, but he and Reinfeldt had previous antipathy. He retained this post following the 2010 general election.

During his time in office, Bildt was widely credited with steering efforts to set up the EU&#x27;s Eastern Partnership in 2008. When Sweden held the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2009, he chaired the sessions of the EU&#x27;s General Affairs and External Relations Council. For several years, he was widely seen as a candidate to become the first High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy under the new rules established by the Treaty of Lisbon; instead, the role went to Catherine Ashton.

Bildt later supported the 2011 military intervention in Libya. On 29 March, the government approved the deployment of JAS 39 Gripen multirole jet fighters to Libya to enforce the no-fly zone.

Following the 2014 European elections, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and other news media considered Bildt as a potential candidate to succeed Ashton as High Representative; this time, the position went to Federica Mogherini.

Bildt lost his post after the 2014 general election, and moved on to become a board member of the International Crisis Group.

=== Turkey ===

Bildt was as foreign minister in 2007 an active supporter for Turkey to join the EU. He called Istanbul a &quot;true center of European history&quot; and called Kemal Atatürk &quot;undoubtedly the most significant European revolutionary of the last century&quot; in 2004. Bildt&#x27;s campaign for Turkey&#x27;s EU membership was controversial in central Europe.

EU membership of Turkey was hindered by its government not recognizing Cyprus, an EU member along with reservations from the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy.

In November 2014 Bildt was criticised for having written an opinion piece in &quot;Dagens industri&quot; newspaper where Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was described as being &quot;on the right track&quot; despite the persecution of Kurds and political opponents and jailed journalists in Turkey.

===South Ossetian conflict===

After the 2008 South Ossetia war, Bildt wrote on his blog that the Russian rationale for its intervention, concern for the welfare of its expatriates in the Near Abroad, had similarities with the rationale for the annexation of Sudetenland. Bildt called South Ossetian independence &quot;a joke&quot;, and said it would be supported only by a &quot;miserable&quot; lot of countries.

==Activities==
===Work in private sector===

After leaving his position as leader of the Moderate Party in 1999, other than engaging in international issues, Bildt took positions in the private sector and positions with international think tanks. His positions in think tanks included serving as the first non-US member on the Board of Trustees of the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California, and on the Advisory Board of the Centre for European Reform in London. He was a member of the board of the European Policy Centre in Brussels, the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, and the International Advisory Board of the Council on Foreign Affairs in New York.

Bildt served as non-executive director of the Baltimore-based US assets management company Legg Mason, Inc. He served as chairman of the board of Teleopti and chairman of the public affairs consultancy Kreab AB, and board member of the IT consultancy HiQ AB. He was chairman of Nordic Venture Network, which brought Nordic high-tech VC firms together in an informal network.

In 2000, Bildt joined the Lundin Group&#x27;s board of directors, a company with oil interests in Ethiopia and Sudan – the seven years with the Lundin Group that followed made Bildt a wealthy man.

From March to November 2000, Bildt was part of an independent panel – together with Jean Peyrelevade and Lothar Späth – to advise the European Space Agency&#x27;s Director General Antonio Rodotà on the organization&#x27;s future.

In 2002, Bildt joined the board of directors of Vostok Nafta, a financial company primarily with holdings in Gazprom.

He left his positions on all these boards upon becoming Foreign Minister in October 2006

===Bosnian war mediator criticisms===

Though decorated for his services in the Bosnian conflict and its immediate aftermath by Great Britain, France, and Germany, his mediation of the conflict and aftermath was castigated as well as celebrated.

Bildt opposed any military intervention and criticized the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher in 1993 for calling NATO to intervene against the Bosnian Serb forces, which led to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; describing Bildt and other EU leaders as &quot;robotic political pygmies&quot; and their acceptance of the ongoing genocide as &quot;shameful&quot;.

Following Bildt&#x27;s appointment as the EU special envoy to Yugoslavia, Tom Warrick from the Coalition for International Justice described Bildt as &quot;dangerously misinformed about his own job description&quot; and largely ignorant about the region. &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized Bildt for a nonchalant attitude towards the Srebrenica genocide when over 8,000 Bosniaks were killed, and described him as being burdened with a reputation for accepting Bosnian Serb claims of good behavior at face value and overlooking evidence of atrocities against civilians.

===Middle East===

Bildt has been questioned for his role as a member of the International Advisory Council of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, a group with ties to the Bush administration pushing for an invasion of Iraq in 2003.

On 8 April 2008, during his visit in Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Bildt gave an interview to Swedish state radio, where he responded to a question on whether it would be possible to strike a peace deal without the involvement of the Palestinian group Hamas, which remained under international boycott. He responded that the Palestinian Fatah-backed government could deal with Israel, in the same way that it was possible for the Israeli government to make peace with Fatah over the objections of the former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who, similarly to Hamas opposed a two-state deal. Israeli officials issued very strongly worded condemnations of this, describing it as &quot;horrible and stupid&quot; and an example of &quot;chutzpah&quot; and &quot;complete ignorance of the Middle East&quot;, on the grounds that they saw it as comparing Hamas and Netanyahu as equals.

In 2012, Bildt said he saw no problem with exporting Swedish weapons to Saudi Arabia. According to Bildt, &quot;Would the situation in the world be better if they had bought French manufactured ones instead?&quot; Bildt called friendly Saudi Arabia as a &quot;family business&quot; and said that he sees Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud &quot;quite regularly&quot;. In 2015, Bildt criticized Sweden&#x27;s foreign minister Margot Wallström for damaging Saudi-Swedish relations. Wallström tweeted criticism of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s flogging of Saudi blogger and activist Raif Badawi.

===Annexation of Crimea===

Bildt, together with Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, was one of the main architects of the 2013 Eastern policy of the EU.

During Euromaidan, Carl Bildt has been criticized in Swedish media for ignoring and downplaying the issues with the Ukrainian Svoboda party. Johan Croneman at &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; has also condemned Bildt for pushing Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt to rephrase himself after having expressed understanding of the Russians&#x27; concerns about the situation.

In a public message on Twitter, Bildt compared Viktor Yanukovych to Vidkun Quisling, writing that he was &quot;sitting on foreign soil begging a foreign army to give his country to him&quot;. This has been described as &quot;undiplomatic&quot; by Christer Jönsson, professor in Political Science at the Lund University. Norwegian politician Anniken Huitfeldt also criticized Bildt&#x27;s statement, saying that it showed &quot;ignorance of history&quot; and that it &quot;does not contribute to solving the conflict&quot;. Torsten Kälvemark from &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; has criticized Bildt&#x27;s statement as well. &quot;Our Foreign Minister is ignorant, because it was actually Norway&#x27;s legal head of state, Haakon VII, that during the war sat on foreign soil and hoped that he would with help from the British get back his country&quot;, he remarked. The culture editorial of the &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; newspaper where Torsten Kälvemark works has repeatedly been criticized since for being a tool of Russian propaganda in Sweden.

Stefan Hedlund, professor at Uppsala University, stated that &quot;Carl Bildt&#x27;s threatening rhetoric should in this context be regarded as extremely destructive&quot;, in an article about the Russo-Ukrainian war. Hedlund also suggested that Bildt should take a &quot;time-out&quot;, and that progress can only be made through dialogue with Russia.

In a radio interview with channel SR P1 on 15 March, Bildt stated that he considers the Crimean referendum illegal, and &quot;invalid, no matter which way people vote&quot;. He continued his refusal to answer questions about Svoboda, saying that he &quot;won&#x27;t describe what that party is&quot;. His overall comment on the new regime in Kyiv was that it was a &quot;reasonable and democratic government&quot; and that he does not want to &quot;play along with Russian propaganda&quot;.

In early 2015, a study made at the Swedish Defence Research Agency stated that Bildt had been a target of information warfare and that he was &quot;regularly smeared in Russian state-controlled media&quot;. The reason was described to be Bildt&#x27;s involvement in the Eastern Partnership program and that the project was perceived as a threat by the Russian government.

In September 2015, Bildt visited Kyiv, where he argued that the EU should provide more financial support to Ukraine.

==Internet activities==

Bildt was an early pioneer among politicians of using the Internet for communicating. On 4 February 1994, he sent an email message to US president Bill Clinton, which was the first publicly known electronic message sent between two heads of government. In the message he praised Clinton&#x27;s decision to end the trade embargo on Vietnam. In the same year, he also started a weekly electronic newsletter which was active until 2005. He is an active blogger, starting his first blog in February 2005. His current blog, started in January 2007, is one of the most widely read political blogs in Sweden.

On 30 May 2007, Bildt officially opened a &quot;Swedish embassy&quot; in the virtual world &quot;Second Life&quot;. The embassy, called &quot;Second House of Sweden&quot;, is a virtual replica of House of Sweden, the Swedish embassy building in Washington, D.C. During Bildt&#x27;s time as Foreign Minister, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has opened a channel on YouTube which has been active since early 2008. He maintains a personal Twitter feed in English with approximately 780,000 subscribed followers. By 2013, an annual Burson Marsteller survey showed him as the best connected world leader. As of 2014, Bildt has served as Chair of the Global Commission on Internet Governance.

==Life after politics==

Bildt served as Chair of the Global Commission on Internet Governance, a joint project of the Centre for International Governance Innovation and Chatham House, from 2014 that concluded its two-year work and produced its report in June 2016. On 19 December 2014 Bildt was announced as a distinguished fellow of the Centre for International Governance Innovation. 

In mid-May 2015, Bildt was appointed to Ukraine&#x27;s International Advisory Council on Reforms. The group consisting of several foreign advisors to President Petro Poroshenko, aims to improve security and economy in the country which has been ravaged by armed conflict in its Eastern part. On 14 May 2015, Bildt was also appointed as an advisor to Russian-controlled investment group LetterOne. In 2016, he joined international law firm Covington as a Senior Policy Advisor in the firm&#x27;s global Public Policy and Government Affairs practice.

Bildt also writes monthly columns for international syndication organization &quot;Project Syndicate&quot;.

Following the 2022 Swedish general election and the election of Ulf Kristersson as Prime Minister Bildt revealed Kristersson had approached him offering to once again make Bildt Minister for Foreign Affairs in his cabinet. Bildt declined the offer, citing he does not like to do the same thing twice.

==Controversy==

On 9 April 2021, the anniversary of the German occupation of Norway, Bildt tweeted that the Swedish defence forces were stronger than Norway and Denmark. His tweet provoked severe backlash, both from the public, and politicians, notably from Norwegian Minister of Culture Abid Raja, saying that he &quot;had hoped our closest neighbour would be more sympathetic towards who this day is reflected by Norwegians and Norwegian Jews&quot;. Bildt stated that his intention was to commemorate the events of the occupation, and that what he tweeted was historically correct. He also added that people have read an assumption between the lines.

<text>Star Wars (later retitled as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) is a 1977 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by Twentieth Century-Fox. It is the first film released in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series and the fourth chronological chapter of the &quot;Skywalker Saga&quot;. Set in a fictional galaxy under the rule of the tyrannical Galactic Empire, the film follows a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance, who aim to destroy the Empire&#x27;s newest weapon, the Death Star. When the Rebel leader Princess Leia is captured by the Empire, Luke Skywalker acquires stolen architectural plans of the Death Star and sets out to rescue her while learning the ways of a metaphysical power known as &quot;the Force&quot; from the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. The cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, David Prowse, and James Earl Jones.

Lucas had the idea for a science fiction film in the vein of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; around the time he completed his first film, &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971), and he began working on a treatment after the release of &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973). After numerous rewrites, filming took place throughout 1975 and 1976 in locations including Tunisia and Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England. Lucas formed the visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic to help create the film&#x27;s visual effects. &quot;Star Wars&quot; suffered production difficulties: the cast and crew believed the film would be a failure, and it went $3 million over budget due to delays.

Few were confident in the film&#x27;s box office prospects. It was released in a small number of theaters in the United States on May 25, 1977, and quickly became a surprise blockbuster hit, leading to it being expanded to a much wider release. &quot;Star Wars&quot; opened to positive reviews, with praise for its special effects. It grossed $410 million worldwide during its initial run, surpassing &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975) to become the highest-grossing film until the release of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982); subsequent releases have brought its total gross to $775 million. When adjusted for inflation, &quot;Star Wars&quot; is the second-highest-grossing film in North America (behind &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;) and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time. It received Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, and Saturn Awards, among others. The film has been reissued many times with Lucas&#x27;s support—most significantly the 20th-anniversary theatrical &quot;Special Edition&quot;—and the reissues have contained many changes, including new scenes, visual effects, and dialogue.

Often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films of all time, &quot;Star Wars&quot; quickly became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, launching an industry of tie-in products, including novels, comics, video games, amusement park attractions and merchandise such as toys, games, and clothing. It became one of the first 25 films selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1989, and its soundtrack was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2004. &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) followed &quot;Star Wars&quot;, rounding out the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. A prequel trilogy and a sequel trilogy have since been released, in addition to two standalone films and various television series.

== Plot ==

Amid a galactic civil war, Rebel Alliance spies have stolen plans to the Death Star, a colossal space station built by the Galactic Empire that is capable of destroying entire planets. Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, secretly a Rebel leader, has obtained the schematics, but her ship is intercepted and boarded by Imperial forces under the command of Darth Vader. Leia is taken prisoner, but the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO escape with the plans, crashing on the nearby planet of Tatooine. Darth Vader learns of this and orders the Imperials to pursue the droids.

The droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to the moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. While Luke is cleaning R2-D2, he discovers a recording of Leia requesting help from a former ally named Obi-Wan Kenobi. R2-D2 goes missing, and while searching for him, Luke is attacked by Sand People. He is rescued by the elderly hermit Ben Kenobi, who soon reveals himself to be Obi-Wan. He tells Luke about his past as one of the Jedi Knights, former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic, who drew mystical abilities from the Force but were nearly exterminated by the Empire. Luke learns that his father, also a Jedi, fought alongside Obi-Wan during the Clone Wars until Vader, Obi-Wan&#x27;s former pupil, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. Obi-Wan gives Luke his father&#x27;s lightsaber, the signature weapon of the Jedi.R2-D2 plays Leia&#x27;s full message, in which she begs Obi-Wan to take the Death Star plans to Alderaan and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis. Luke initially declines Obi-Wan&#x27;s offer to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force, but he is left with no choice after Imperial stormtroopers murder his family and destroy his home while searching for the droids. Seeking a way off the planet, Luke and Obi-Wan travel to the city of Mos Eisley and hire Han Solo and Chewbacca, pilots of the starship &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;.

Before the &quot;Falcon&quot; reaches Alderaan, the Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin has the planet obliterated by the station&#x27;s superlaser. Upon arrival, the &quot;Falcon&quot; is captured by the Death Star&#x27;s tractor beam, but the passengers avoid detection and infiltrate the station. As Obi-Wan leaves to deactivate the tractor beam, Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help him rescue Leia, who is scheduled for execution after refusing to reveal the location of the Rebel base. After disabling the tractor beam, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel against Vader, which allows the rest of the group to escape. Using a tracking device placed on the &quot;Falcon&quot;, the Empire locates the Rebel base on the moon Yavin 4.

Analysis of the Death Star schematics reveals a weakness in a small exhaust port leading directly to the station&#x27;s reactor. Luke joins the Rebellion&#x27;s X-wing squadron in a desperate attack against the Death Star, while Han and Chewbacca leave to pay off a debt to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. In the ensuing battle, Vader leads a squadron of TIE fighters and destroys several Rebel ships. Han and Chewbacca unexpectedly return in the &quot;Falcon&quot;, knocking Vader&#x27;s ship off course before he can shoot Luke down. Guided by the voice of Obi-Wan&#x27;s spirit, Luke uses the Force to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, causing the Death Star to explode moments before it can fire on the Rebel base. 

In a triumphant ceremony, Leia awards Luke and Han medals for their heroism.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

Lucas had the idea for a space opera prior to 1971. According to Mark Hamill, he wanted to make it before his 1973 coming-of-age film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. His original plan was to adapt the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; space adventure comics and serials into films, having been fascinated by them since he was young. Lucas attempted to purchase the rights, but they had already been acquired by producer Dino De Laurentiis. Lucas then discovered that &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; was inspired by the &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; book series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the author of &quot;Tarzan&quot;. Burroughs, in turn, had been influenced by &quot;Gulliver on Mars&quot;, a 1905 science fantasy written by Edwin Arnold. Lucas took the science fantasy concept and began developing what he would later call a &quot;space fantasy&quot;.

In May 1971, Lucas persuaded the head of United Artists, David Picker, to take a chance on two of his film ideas: &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and the space opera. Although Lucas signed a two-picture deal, the studio ultimately declined to produce &quot;Graffiti&quot;. Universal Pictures picked it up, and Lucas spent the next two years making the coming-of-age film, which was immensely successful. In January 1973, he began working on the space opera full-time. He began the process by inventing odd names for characters and places. By the time the screenplay was finalized he had discarded many of the names, but several made it into the final script and later sequels. He used his early notes to compile a two-page synopsis titled &quot;Journal of the Whills&quot;, which chronicled the tale of CJ Thorpe, an apprentice &quot;Jedi-Bendu&quot;, who was being trained by the legendary Mace Windy. He felt that this story was too difficult to understand, however.

Lucas began writing a 13-page treatment called &quot;The Star Wars&quot; on April 17, 1973, which had narrative parallels with Kurosawa&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;. He later explained that &quot;Star Wars&quot; is not a story about the future, but rather a &quot;fantasy&quot; that has more in common with the Brothers Grimm than &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. He said his motivation for making the film was to give young people an &quot;honest, wholesome fantasy life,&quot; of the kind his generation had. He hoped it would offer &quot;the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie&quot;.

While impressed with the innocence of the story and the sophistication of Lucas&#x27;s fictional world, United Artists declined to fund the project. Lucas and Kurtz then presented the treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. Universal agreed it could be a successful venture, but had doubts about Lucas&#x27;s ability to execute his vision. Kurtz has claimed the studio&#x27;s rejection was primarily due to Universal head Lew Wasserman&#x27;s low opinion of science fiction, and the generally low popularity of the genre at the time. Francis Ford Coppola subsequently brought the project to a division of Paramount Pictures he ran with fellow directors Peter Bogdanovich and William Friedkin, but Friedkin questioned Lucas&#x27;s ability to direct the film, and both directors declined to finance it. Walt Disney Productions also turned down the project.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; was accepted by Twentieth Century-Fox in June 1973. Studio president Alan Ladd Jr. did not grasp the technical side of the project, but believed in Lucas&#x27;s talent. Lucas later stated that Ladd invested in him, not in the film. The Fox deal gave Lucas $150,000 to write and direct the film. In August, &quot;American Graffiti&quot; opened to massive success, which afforded Lucas the necessary leverage to renegotiate the deal and gain control of merchandising and sequel rights.

=== Writing ===

Since commencing the writing process in January 1973, Lucas wrote four different screenplays for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, searching for &quot;just the right ingredients, characters and storyline.&quot; By May 1974, he had expanded the original treatment into a full, 132-page rough draft, which included elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general named Annikin Starkiller. He then changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and shifted the general—who came from a family of dwarfs—into a supporting role. Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills. He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog, Indiana, who often acted as his &quot;co-pilot&quot; by sitting in the passenger seat of his car. The dog&#x27;s name would later be given to the character Indiana Jones.

Lucas completed a second draft in January 1975 entitled &quot;Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode One: The Star Wars&quot;. He had made substantial simplifications and introduced the young, farm-dwelling hero as Luke Starkiller. In this draft, Luke had several brothers. Annikin became Luke&#x27;s father, a wise Jedi Knight who played a minor role at the end of the story. Early versions of the characters Han Solo and Chewbacca were present, and closely resemble those seen in the finished film. This draft introduced a mystical energy field called &quot;The Force,&quot; the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side, and a historical Jedi who was the first to turn, and who subsequently trained the Sith. The script also included a Jedi Master with a son who trains to be a Jedi under his father&#x27;s friend; this would ultimately form the basis for the finished film and, later, the original trilogy. This version was more a fairy tale quest than the action-filled adventure story of the previous draft, and ended with a text crawl that previewed the next story in the series. According to Lucas, the second draft was over 200 pages long, which led him to split up the story into multiple films spanning multiple trilogies.

While writing a third draft, Lucas claims to have been influenced by comics, J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Joseph Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, James George Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, and Bruno Bettelheim&#x27;s &quot;The Uses of Enchantment.&quot; Author Michael Kaminski has objected to Lucas&#x27;s claim regarding the Bettelheim book, arguing that it was not released until after &quot;Star Wars&quot; was filmed (J.W. Rinzler speculates that Lucas may have obtained an advance copy). Kaminski also writes that Campbell&#x27;s influence on &quot;Star Wars&quot; has been exaggerated by Lucas and others, and that Lucas&#x27;s second draft was &quot;even closer to Campbell&#x27;s structure&quot; than the third.

Lucas has claimed he wrote a version of the screenplay that was 250–300 pages long, which outlined the plot of the entire original trilogy. Realizing it was too lengthy for a single film, he decided to spread the story over three films. This division caused problems with the first episode; Lucas had to use the ending of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which resulted in a Death Star being included in both films. In 1975, Lucas envisioned a trilogy which would end with the destruction of the Empire, and possibly a prequel about Obi-Wan as a young man. After &quot;Star Wars&quot; became tremendously successful, Lucasfilm announced that Lucas had already written twelve more Luke Skywalker stories, which, according to Kurtz, were &quot;separate adventures&quot; rather than traditional sequels.

On February 27, 1975, Fox granted the film a budget of $5 million, which was later increased to $8.25 million. Lucas then started writing with a budget in mind, conceiving the cheap, &quot;used&quot; look of much of the film, and—with Fox having just shut down its special effects department—reducing the number of complex special effects shots called for by the script. The finalized third draft, dated August 1, 1975, was titled &quot;The Star Wars From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller&quot;. This version had most of the elements of the final plot, with only some differences in the characters and settings. It presented Luke as an only child whose father was already dead, and who was cared for by a man named Ben Kenobi. This script would be rewritten for the fourth and final draft, dated January 1, 1976, and titled &quot;The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars&quot;. Lucas&#x27;s friends Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck helped him revise the fourth draft into the final pre-production script.

Lucas finished the screenplay in March 1976, when the crew started filming. During production, he changed Luke&#x27;s surname from Starkiller to Skywalker, and changed the title first to &quot;The Star Wars&quot;, and then, finally, to &quot;Star Wars&quot;. For the film&#x27;s opening crawl, Lucas originally wrote a composition of six paragraphs with four sentences each. He showed the draft to his friend, director Brian De Palma, who called it &quot;gibberish&quot; that &quot;goes on forever.&quot; De Palma and screenwriter Jay Cocks helped edit the crawl into its final form, which contains only four sentences.

===Casting===
Lucas had a preference for casting unknown (or relatively unknown) actors, which led him to select Hamill and Fisher for leading roles. Hamill was cast as Luke over Robby Benson, Robert Englund, William Katt, Kurt Russell, and Charles Martin Smith, while Fisher was cast as Leia over Karen Allen, Amy Irving, Terri Nunn, Cindy Williams, and Linda Purl. Jodie Foster was offered the role, but turned it down because she was under contract with Disney. Koo Stark was also considered for Leia, but was instead cast as Luke&#x27;s friend Camie Marstrap, a character that did not make the final cut of the film.

Lucas initially resisted casting Ford as Han, since Ford had previously worked with Lucas on &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, and was therefore not unknown. Instead, the director asked Ford to assist with auditions by reading lines with other actors. However, Lucas was eventually won over by Ford, and cast him as Han over many other actors who auditioned.

Lucas recognized that he needed an established star to play Obi-Wan. He considered Cushing for the role, but decided the actor&#x27;s lean features would be better employed as the villainous Tarkin. The film&#x27;s producer, Gary Kurtz, felt a strong character actor was required to convey the &quot;stability and gravitas&quot; of Obi-Wan. Before Guinness was cast, the Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune—who stars in many Akira Kurosawa films—was considered for the role. His daughter, Mika Kitagawa, said her father &quot;had a lot of samurai pride&quot; and turned down the roles of Obi-Wan and Vader because he thought &quot;Star Wars&quot; would employ cheap special effects and would therefore &quot;cheapen the image of samurai&quot;. Lucas credited Guinness with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder, which contributed significantly to the completion of filming. Ford said he admired Guinness&#x27;s preparation, professionalism and kindness towards the other actors. He recalled Guinness having &quot;a very clear head about how to serve the story.&quot; On top of his salary, Guinness received 2.25% of the film&#x27;s backend grosses, which made him wealthy later in life.

Daniels said he wanted the role of C-3PO after he saw a Ralph McQuarrie concept painting of the character and was struck by the vulnerability in the droid&#x27;s face. After casting Daniels for the physical performance, Lucas intended to hire another actor for the droid&#x27;s voice. According to Daniels, thirty well-established actors auditioned—including Richard Dreyfuss and Mel Blanc—but Daniels received the voice role after one of the actors suggested the idea to Lucas.

Baker (R2-D2) and Mayhew (Chewbacca) were cast largely due to their height. At 3 feet 8 inches (1.12 m), Baker was offered the role of the dimunitive droid immediately after meeting Lucas. He turned it down multiple times, however, before finally accepting it. R2-D2&#x27;s beeps and squeaks were made by sound designer Ben Burtt by imitating baby noises, recording his voice over an intercom, and finally mixing the sounds together using a synthesizer. Mayhew initially auditioned for Vader, but Prowse was cast instead. However, when Lucas and Kurtz saw Mayhew&#x27;s stature, they quickly cast him as Chewbacca. Mayhew modeled his performance on the mannerisms of animals he observed in public zoos.

Prowse was originally offered the role of Chewbacca, but turned it down, as he wanted to play the villain. Prowse portrayed Vader physically, but Lucas felt his West Country English accent was inappropriate for the character, and selected James Earl Jones for Vader&#x27;s voice. Lucas considered Orson Welles for the voice role, but was concerned his voice would be too familiar to audiences. Jones was uncredited until 1983. However, upon the film&#x27;s release, audiences and critics immediately recognized Jones&#x27; voice as Darth Vader.

=== Design ===
During pre-production, Lucas recruited several conceptual designers: Colin Cantwell, who visualized the initial spacecraft models; Alex Tavoularis, who created storyboard sketches from early scripts; and Ralph McQuarrie, who created conceptual images of characters, costumes, props, and scenery. McQuarrie&#x27;s paintings helped the studio visualize the film, which positively influenced their decision to fund the project. His artwork also set the visual tone for &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the rest of the original trilogy.

Lucas wanted to create props and sets (based on McQuarrie&#x27;s paintings) that had never before been used in science-fiction films. He hired as production designers John Barry and Roger Christian, who were then working on the film &quot;Lucky Lady&quot; (1975). Christian remembers that Lucas did not want anything in &quot;Star Wars&quot; to stand out, and &quot;wanted it [to look] all real and used.&quot; In this &quot;used future&quot; aesthetic, all devices, ships, and buildings related to Tatooine and the Rebels look aged and dirty, and the Rebel ships look cobbled together in contrast to the Empire&#x27;s sleeker designs. Lucas believed this aesthetic would lend credibility to the film&#x27;s fictional places, and Christian was enthusiastic about this approach.

Barry and Christian started working with Lucas before &quot;Star Wars&quot; was funded by Fox. For several months, in a studio in Kensal Rise, England, they planned the creation of props and sets with very little money. According to Christian, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; set was the most difficult to build. He wanted the interior of the ship to look like a submarine, and used inexpensive airplane scrap metal to achieve the desired effect. Set construction later moved to Elstree Studios, where Barry created thirty sets. All nine sound stages at Elstree were needed to house the fabricated planets, starships, caves, control rooms, cantinas, and Death Star corridors. The Rebel hangar was so massive it had to be built at nearby Shepperton Studios, which contained Europe&#x27;s largest sound stage at the time.

=== Filming ===

In 1975, Lucas founded the visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) after discovering that Fox&#x27;s visual effects department had been shut down. ILM began its work on &quot;Star Wars&quot; in a warehouse in Van Nuys, California. Most of the visual effects used pioneering digital motion control photography developed by John Dykstra and his team, which created the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras. The technology is now known as the Dykstraflex system.

Visually, Lucas wanted &quot;Star Wars&quot; to have the &quot;ethereal quality&quot; of a fairy tale, but also &quot;an alien look.&quot; He hoped to achieve &quot;the seeming contradiction of [the] strange graphics of fantasy combined with the feel of a documentary.&quot; His first choice for cinematographer was Geoffrey Unsworth, who had worked on &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Unsworth initially accepted the job, but eventually withdrew to work on the Vincente Minnelli-directed &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; (1976). Unsworth was replaced by Gilbert Taylor, who had overseen photography for &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (both 1964). Lucas admired Taylor&#x27;s work on both films, describing them as &quot;eccentrically photographed pictures with a strong documentary flavor.&quot;

Once photography was under way, Lucas and Taylor had many disputes. Lucas&#x27;s lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor, who believed Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. After Fox executives complained about the soft-focus visual style of the film, Taylor changed his approach, which infuriated Lucas. Kurtz said that Lucas&#x27;s inability to delegate tasks resulted from his history directing low-budget films, which required him to be involved with all aspects of the production. Taylor claims that Lucas avoided contact with him, which motivated the cinematographer to make his own decisions about how to shoot the film.
Originally, Lucas envisioned Tatooine as a jungle planet, and Kurtz traveled to the Philippines to scout locations. However, the thought of spending months filming in the jungle made Lucas uncomfortable, so he made Tatooine a desert planet instead. Kurtz then researched various desert locales around the globe. He ultimately decided that Southern Tunisia, on the edge of the Sahara, would make an ideal Tatooine. Principal photography began in Chott el Djerid on March 22, 1976. Meanwhile, a construction crew in nearby Tozeur spent eight weeks creating additional Tatooine locations. The scenes of Luke&#x27;s Tatooine home were filmed at the Hotel Sidi Driss, in Matmata. Additional Tatooine scenes were shot at Death Valley in the United States.

The filmmakers experienced many problems in Tunisia. Production fell behind schedule in the first week due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns. The radio-controlled R2-D2 models functioned poorly. The left leg of Anthony Daniels&#x27;s C-3PO costume shattered, injuring his foot. A rare winter rainstorm struck the country, which further disrupted filming. After two and a half weeks in Tunisia, production moved to Elstree Studios in London for interior scenes.

Kurtz has described Lucas as a shy &quot;loner&quot; who does not enjoy working with a large cast and crew. According to Carrie Fisher, he gave very little direction to the actors, and when he did, it usually consisted of the words &quot;faster&quot; and &quot;more intense&quot;. Laws in Britain stipulated that filming had to finish by 5:30 pm, unless Lucas was in the middle of a shot, in which case he could ask the crew to stay an extra 15 minutes. However, his requests were usually turned down. Most of the British crew considered &quot;Star Wars&quot; a children&#x27;s film, and the actors sometimes did not take the project seriously. Kenny Baker later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure.
According to Taylor, it was impossible to light the Elstree sets in the conventional way. He was forced to break open the walls, ceilings and floors, placing quartz lamps inside the openings he created. This lighting system gave Lucas the ability to shoot in almost any direction without extensive relighting. In total, filming in Britain took fourteen and a half weeks. While visiting an English travel agency, Lucas saw a poster depicting Tikal, Guatemala, and decided to use the location for the moon Yavin 4. The scenes of the Rebel base on Yavin were filmed in the local Mayan temples. The animation of the Death Star plans shown at the base were created by computer programmer Larry Cuba, using the GRASS programming language. It is the only digital computer animation utilized in the original version of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The visual simulation of Yavin 4 orbiting its mother planet was created on the Scanimate analog computer. All the other computer monitors and targeting displays in the film featured simulated computer graphics, which were generated using pre-digital animation methods, such as hand-drawn backlight animation.

Although Obi-Wan did not die in the final version of the script, Alec Guinness disliked the character&#x27;s dialogue and said he begged Lucas to kill him off. Lucas, however, claimed he added Obi-Wan&#x27;s death because the character served no purpose after his duel with Vader.

At Fox, Alan Ladd endured scrutiny from board members over the film&#x27;s complex screenplay and rising budget. After the filmmakers requested more than the original $8 million budget, Kurtz said the executives &quot;got a bit scared.&quot; According to Kurtz, the filmmaking team spent two weeks drafting a new budget. With the project behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas he had to finish production within a week or it would be shut down. The crew split into three units, led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor Robert Watts. Under the new system, they met the studio&#x27;s deadline.

The screenplay originally featured a human Jabba the Hutt, but the character was removed due to budget and time constraints. The idea of Jabba being an alien did not arise until work began on the 1979 &quot;Star Wars&quot; re-release. Lucas would later claim he had wanted to superimpose a stop-motion creature over a human actor; he accomplished a similar effect with computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the 1997 Special Edition. According to Greedo actor Paul Blake, his character was created as a result of Lucas having to cut the Jabba scene.

During production, the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile, as he often appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level. Post-production was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from the studio. Another obstacle arose when Hamill&#x27;s face became visibly scarred after a car accident, which restricted re-shoots featuring Luke.

=== Post-production ===
&quot;Star Wars&quot; was originally slated for release on December 25, 1976, but production delays pushed it back to mid-1977. Editor John Jympson began cutting the film while Lucas was still filming in Tunisia; as Lucas noted, the editor was in an &quot;impossible position&quot; because Lucas had not explained any of the film&#x27;s material to him. When Lucas viewed Jympson&#x27;s rough cut, he felt the editor&#x27;s selection of takes was questionable. He felt Jympson did not fully understand the film nor Lucas&#x27;s style of filmmaking, and he continued to disapprove of Jympson&#x27;s editing as time went by. Halfway through production, Lucas fired Jympson and replaced him with Paul Hirsch, Richard Chew, and his then-wife, Marcia Lucas. The new editing team felt Jympson&#x27;s cut lacked excitement, and they sought to inject more dynamism into the film.

Jympson&#x27;s rough cut of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (often called the &quot;Lost Cut&quot;) differed significantly from the final version. Author David West Reynolds describes Jympson&#x27;s version as &quot;more leisurely paced&quot;, and estimates that it contained 30–40% different footage from the final cut. Although most of the differences relate to extended scenes or alternate takes, there were also scenes which were completely removed to accelerate the pace of the narrative. The most notable of these were a series from Tatooine, when Luke is first introduced. Set in the city of Anchorhead, the scenes depicted Luke&#x27;s everyday life among his friends, and showed how their lives are affected by the space battle above the planet. These scenes also introduced Biggs Darklighter, Luke&#x27;s closest friend who leaves to join the Rebellion. Hirsch said the scenes were removed because they presented too much information in the first few minutes of the film, and they created too many storylines for the audience to follow. The removal of the Anchorhead scenes also helped distinguish &quot;Star Wars&quot; from Lucas&#x27;s previous film; Alan Ladd called the deleted scenes &quot;&quot;American Graffiti&quot; in outer space&quot;. Lucas also wanted to shift the narrative focus to C-3PO and R2-D2 at the beginning of the film. He explained that having &quot;the first half hour of the film be mainly about robots was a bold idea.&quot;

Meanwhile, ILM was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects. The company had spent half its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable. With hundreds of shots remaining, ILM was forced to finish a year&#x27;s work in six months. To inspire the visual effects team, Lucas spliced together clips of aerial dogfights from old war films. These kinetic segments helped the team understand his vision for scenes in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

Sound designer Ben Burtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an &quot;organic soundtrack&quot;. Blaster sounds were created by modifying the noise of a steel cable being struck while under tension. Lightsaber sound effects were a combination of the hum of movie projector motors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless microphone. Burtt discovered the latter accidentally while searching for a buzzing, sparking sound to add to the projector-motor hum. For Chewbacca&#x27;s speech, Burtt combined the sounds of four bears, a badger, a lion, a seal, and a walrus. Burtt achieved Vader&#x27;s breathing noise by breathing through the mask of a scuba regulator; this process inspired the idea of Vader being a burn victim.

In February 1977, Lucas screened an early cut of the film for Fox executives, several director friends, and Roy Thomas and Howard Chaykin of Marvel Comics, who were preparing a &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic book. The cut had a different crawl from the finished version and used Prowse&#x27;s voice for Vader. It also lacked most special effects; hand-drawn arrows took the place of blaster beams, and footage of World War II dogfights replaced space battles between TIE fighters and the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. Several of Lucas&#x27;s friends failed to understand the film, and their reactions disappointed Lucas. Steven Spielberg enjoyed it, however, and believed the lack of enthusiasm from others was due to the absence of finished special effects. In contrast, Ladd and the other studio executives loved the film; production executive Gareth Wigan described the experience as the &quot;most extraordinary day of [his] life.&quot; Lucas, who was accustomed to negative reactions from executives, found the experience shocking and rewarding.

Ladd reluctantly agreed to release an extra $50,000 in funding. The unit also completed additional studio footage for the Mos Eisley cantina sequence.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; was completed less than a week before its May 25, 1977, release date. With all of the film&#x27;s elements coming together just in time, Lucas described the work as not so much finished, but &quot;abandoned&quot;. &quot;Star Wars&quot; began production with a budget of $8 million; the total budget eventually reached $11 million.

== Soundtrack ==

Lucas initially planned to use pre-existing music for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, rather than an original score. Since the film portrayed alien worlds, he believed recognizable music was needed to create a sense of familiarity. He hired John Williams as a music consultant, and showed him a collection of orchestral pieces he intended to use for the soundtrack. After Williams convinced Lucas that an original score would be preferable, Lucas tasked him with creating it. A few of the composer&#x27;s finished pieces were influenced by Lucas&#x27;s initial orchestral selections. The &quot;Main Title Theme&quot; was inspired by the theme from the 1942 film &quot;Kings Row&quot; (scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold), and the &quot;Dune Sea of Tatooine&quot; was influenced by the music of &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (scored by Alessandro Cicognini). Lucas later denied he ever considered using pre-existing music for the film.

Over a period of 12 days in March 1977, Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra recorded the &quot;Star Wars&quot; score. The soundtrack was released as a double LP in 1977 by 20th Century Fox Records. That year, the label also released &quot;The Story of Star Wars&quot;, an audio drama adaptation of the film utilizing some of its music, dialogue, and sound effects.

In 2005, the American Film Institute chose the &quot;Star Wars&quot; soundtrack as the best film score of all time.

== Cinematic and literary allusions ==
Before creating &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Lucas had hoped to make a &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film, but was unable to obtain the rights. &quot;Star Wars&quot; features many elements ostensibly derived from &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, such as the conflict between rebels and imperial forces; the fusion of mythology and futuristic technology; the wipe transitions between scenes; and the text crawl at the beginning of the film. Lucas also reportedly drew from Joseph Campbell&#x27;s book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; and Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;. Robey has also suggested that the Mos Eisley cantina brawl was influenced by Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961), and that the scene in which Luke and his friends hide in the floor of the &quot;Millenium Falcon&quot; was derived from that film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Sanjuro&quot; (1962).

&quot;Star Wars&quot; has been compared to Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; book series in multiple ways. Both have desert planets: &quot;Star Wars&quot; has Tatooine, while &quot;Dune&quot; has Arrakis, which is the source of a longevity spice. &quot;Star Wars&quot;, meanwhile, makes references to spice mines and a spice freighter. Jedi mind tricks in &quot;Star Wars&quot; have been compared to &quot;The Voice&quot;, a controlling ability used by the Bene Gesserit in Herbert&#x27;s novels. Luke&#x27;s Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are moisture farmers; on Arrakis, dew collectors are used by Fremen to collect and recycle small amounts of water. Herbert reported that David Lynch, director of the 1984 film &quot;Dune,&quot; &quot;had trouble with the fact that &quot;Star Wars&quot; used up so much of &quot;Dune&quot;.&quot; Herbert and Lynch found &quot;sixteen points of identity&quot; between the two universes, and argued that these similarities could not be a coincidence.

Writing for &quot;Starwars.com&quot; in 2013, Bryan Young noted many similarities between Lucas&#x27;s space opera and the World War II film &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955). In &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Rebel ships assault the Death Star by diving into a trench and attempting to fire torpedoes into a small exhaust port; in &quot;Dam Busters&quot;, British bombers fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim bouncing bombs at dams to cripple the heavy industry of Germany (also, &quot;Star Wars&quot; cinematographer Gilbert Taylor filmed the special effects sequences in &quot;Dam Busters&quot;). Lucas used clips from both &quot;Dam Busters&quot; and &quot;633 Squadron&quot; (1964), another war film with a climactic bomber run through narrow fjords, to illustrate his vision for dogfights in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

Journalist and blogger Martin Belam has pointed out similarities between the Death Star&#x27;s docking bay and the docking bay on the space station in &quot;2001&quot;. In 2014, Young observed a number of parallels between Lucas&#x27;s space opera and Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1927 film &quot;Metropolis&quot;. &quot;Star Wars&quot; has also been compared to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939).

== Marketing ==

While the film was in production, a logo was commissioned from Dan Perri, a title sequence designer who had worked on &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976). Perri created a logotype consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and leaning towards a vanishing point. The graphic was designed to follow the same perspective as the opening text crawl. Ultimately, Perri&#x27;s logo was not used for the film&#x27;s opening title sequence, although it was used widely in pre-release print advertising and on cinema marquees.

The logotype eventually selected for on-screen use originated in a promotional brochure that was distributed by Fox to cinema owners in 1976. The brochure was designed by Suzy Rice, a young art director at the Los Angeles advertising agency Seiniger Advertising. On a visit to ILM in Van Nuys, Rice was instructed by Lucas to produce a &quot;very fascist&quot; logo that would intimidate the viewer. Rice employed an outlined and modified Helvetica Black typeface in her initial version. After some feedback from Lucas, Rice joined the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; of &quot;STAR&quot; and the &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; of &quot;WARS&quot;. Kurtz was impressed with Rice&#x27;s composition and selected it over Perri&#x27;s design for the film&#x27;s opening titles, after flattening the pointed tips of the letter &quot;W&quot;. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; logo became one of the most recognizable designs in cinema, though Rice was not credited in the film.

For the film&#x27;s US release, Fox commissioned a promotional poster from the advertising agency Smolen, Smith and Connolly. The agency contracted the freelance artist Tom Jung, and gave him the phrase &quot;good over evil&quot; as a starting point. His poster, known as &quot;Style &#x27;A, depicts Luke standing in a heroic pose, brandishing a shining lightsaber above his head. Leia is slightly below him, and a large image of Vader&#x27;s helmet looms behind them. Some Fox executives considered this poster &quot;too dark&quot; and commissioned the Brothers Hildebrandt, a pair of well-known fantasy artists, to modify it for the UK release. When &quot;Star Wars&quot; opened in British theaters, the Hildebrandts&#x27; &quot;Style &#x27;B&#x27;&quot; poster was used on cinema billboards. Fox and Lucasfilm later decided to promote the film with a less stylized and more realistic depiction of the lead characters, and commissioned a new design from Tom Chantrell. Two months after &quot;Star Wars&quot; opened, the Hildebrandts&#x27; poster was replaced by Chantrell&#x27;s &quot;Style &#x27;C version in UK cinemas.

Fox gave &quot;Star Wars&quot; little marketing support beyond licensed T-shirts and posters. The film&#x27;s marketing director, Charley Lippincott, had to look elsewhere for promotional opportunities. He secured deals with Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation and with Del Rey Books for a novelization. A fan of science fiction, Lippincott used his contacts to promote the film at San Diego Comic-Con and elsewhere within the science-fiction community.

== Release ==

=== MPAA rating ===
When &quot;Star Wars&quot; was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America&#x27;s rating board, the votes for the rating were evenly split between G and PG. In an unusual move, Fox requested the stricter PG rating, in part because it believed the film was too scary for young children, but also because it feared teenagers would perceive the G rating as &quot;uncool&quot;. Lucasfilm marketer Charley Lippincott supported Fox&#x27;s position after witnessing a five-year-old at the film&#x27;s preview become upset by a scene in which Darth Vader chokes a Rebel captain. Although the board initially opted for the G rating, it reneged after Fox&#x27;s request and applied the PG rating.

=== First public screening ===
On May 1, 1977, the first public screening of &quot;Star Wars&quot; was held at Northpoint Theatre in San Francisco,&lt;ref name=&quot;cinematreasures/5426&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where &quot;American Graffiti&quot; had been test-screened four years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;kcbsradio/before-anyone-else&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Premiere and initial release ===

Lucas wanted the film released in May, on the Memorial Day weekend. According to Fox executive Gareth Wigan, &quot;Nobody had ever opened a summer film before school was out.&quot; Lucas, however, hoped the school-term release would build word-of-mouth publicity among children. Fox ultimately decided on a release date of May 25, the Wednesday before the holiday weekend. Very few theaters, however, wanted to show &quot;Star Wars&quot;. To encourage exhibitors to purchase the film, Fox packaged it with &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot;, a film based on a bestselling book. If a theater wanted to show &quot;Midnight,&quot; it was required to show &quot;Star Wars&quot; as well.

Lucas&#x27;s film debuted on Wednesday, May 25, 1977, in 32 theaters. Another theater was added on Thursday, and ten more began showing the film on Friday. On Wednesday, Lucas was so absorbed in work—approving advertising campaigns and mixing sound for the film&#x27;s wider-release version—that he forgot the film was opening that day. His first glimpse of its success occurred that evening, when he and Marcia went out for dinner on Hollywood Boulevard. Across the street, crowds were lining up outside Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, waiting to see &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

Two weeks after its release, Lucas&#x27;s film was replaced by William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;Sorcerer&quot; at Mann&#x27;s because of contractual obligations. The theater owner moved &quot;Star Wars&quot; to a less-prestigious location after quickly renovating it. After &quot;Sorcerer&quot; failed to meet expectations, Lucas&#x27;s film was given a second opening at Mann&#x27;s on August 3. Thousands of people attended a ceremony in which C-3PO, R2-D2 and Darth Vader placed their footprints in the theater&#x27;s forecourt. By this time, &quot;Star Wars&quot; was playing in 1,096 theaters in the United States. Approximately 60 theaters played the film continuously for over a year. In May 1978, Lucasfilm distributed &quot;Birthday Cake&quot; posters to those theaters for special events on the one-year anniversary of the film&#x27;s release. &quot;Star Wars&quot; premiered in the UK on December 27, 1977. News reports of the film&#x27;s popularity in America caused long lines to form at the two London theaters that first offered the film; it became available in 12 large cities in January 1978, and additional London theaters in February.

The film immediately broke box office records. Three weeks after it opened, Fox&#x27;s stock price had doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, the studio&#x27;s highest annual profit was $37 million. In 1977, it posted a profit of $79 million. Lucas had instantly become very wealthy. His friend, director Francis Ford Coppola, sent a telegram to his hotel asking for money to finish his film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Cast members became instant household names, and even technical crew members, such as model makers, were asked for autographs. When Harrison Ford visited a record store to buy an album, enthusiastic fans tore half his shirt off.

Lucas had been certain Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; would outperform his space opera at the box office. Before &quot;Star Wars&quot; opened, Lucas proposed to Spielberg that they trade 2.5% of the profit on each other&#x27;s films. Spielberg accepted, believing Lucas&#x27;s film would be the bigger hit. Spielberg still receives 2.5% of the profits from &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Star Wars&quot; remains one of the most financially successful films of all time. It earned over $2.5 million in its first six days ($ in dollars). According to &quot;Variety&quot; weekly box office charts, it was number one at the US box office for its first three weeks. It was dethroned by &quot;The Deep&quot;, but gradually added screens and returned to number one in its seventh week, building up to $7-million weekends as it entered wide release ($ in dollars) and remained number one for the next 15 weeks. It replaced &quot;Jaws&quot; as the highest-earning film in North America just six months into release, eventually grossing over $220 million during its initial theatrical run ($ in dollars). &quot;Star Wars&quot; entered international release towards the end of the year, and in 1978 added the worldwide record to its domestic one, earning $314.4 million in total. Its biggest international market was Japan, where it grossed $58.4 million.

On July 21, 1978, while still showing in 38 theaters in the US, the film expanded into a 1,744 theater national saturation windup of release and set a new U.S. weekend record of $10,202,726. The gross prior to the expansion was $221,280,994. The expansion added a further $43,774,911 to take its gross to $265,055,905. Reissues in 1979 ($22,455,262), 1981 ($17,247,363), and 1982 ($17,981,612) brought its cumulative gross in the U.S. and Canada to $323 million, and extended its global earnings to $530 million. In doing so, it became the first film to gross $500 million worldwide, and remained the highest-grossing film of all time until &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; broke that record in 1983.

The release of the Special Edition in 1997 was the highest-grossing reissue of all-time with a gross of $138.3 million, bringing its total gross in the United States and Canada to $460,998,007, reclaiming the all-time number one spot. Internationally, the reissue grossed $117.2 million, with $26 million from the United Kingdom and $15 million from Japan. In total, the film has grossed over $775 million worldwide.

Adjusted for inflation, it had earned over $2.5 billion worldwide at 2011 prices, which saw it ranked as the third-highest-grossing film at the time, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. At the North American box office, it ranks second behind &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; on the inflation-adjusted list.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Star Wars&quot; received many positive reviews upon its release. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called the film &quot;an out-of-body experience&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;the most elaborate... most beautiful movie serial ever made&quot;. A. D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;magnificent&quot; and said Lucas had succeeded in his attempt to create the &quot;biggest possible adventure fantasy&quot; based on the serials and action epics of his childhood. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Gary Arnold gave the film a positive review, calling it &quot;a new classic in a rousing movie tradition: a space swashbuckler.&quot; &quot;Star Wars&quot; was not without its detractors, however. Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said &quot;there&#x27;s no breather in the picture, no lyricism&quot;, and no &quot;emotional grip&quot;. John Simon of &quot;New York&quot; magazine also panned the film, writing, &quot;Strip &quot;Star Wars&quot; of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality.&quot;

In the UK, Barry Norman of &quot;Film...&quot; called the movie &quot;family entertainment at its most sublime&quot;, which combines &quot;all the best-loved themes of romantic adventure&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s science correspondent Adrian Berry said that &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;is the best such film since &quot;2001&quot; and in certain respects it is one of the most exciting ever made&quot;. He described the plot as &quot;unpretentious and pleasantly devoid of any &#x27;message&#x27;&quot;.

Gene Siskel, writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, said, &quot;What places it a sizable cut above the routine is its spectacular visual effects, the best since Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001&quot;.&quot; Andrew Collins of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine awarded the film five out of five and said, &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot;″ timeless appeal lies in its easily identified, universal archetypes—goodies to root for, baddies to boo, a princess to be rescued and so on—and if it is most obviously dated to the 70s by the special effects, so be it.&quot; In his 1977 review, Robert Hatch of &quot;The Nation&quot; called the film &quot;an outrageously successful, what will be called a &#x27;classic,&#x27; compilation of nonsense, largely derived but thoroughly reconditioned. I doubt that anyone will ever match it, though the imitations must already be on the drawing boards.&quot; In a more critical review, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; stated, &quot;None of these characters has any depth, and they&#x27;re all treated like the fanciful props and settings.&quot; Peter Keough of the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; is a junkyard of cinematic gimcracks not unlike the Jawas&#x27; heap of purloined, discarded, barely functioning droids.&quot;

In a 1978 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, scientist Carl Sagan called attention to the overwhelming whiteness of the human characters in the film. Actor Raymond St. Jacques echoed Sagan&#x27;s complaint, writing that &quot;the terrifying realization... [is] that black people (or any ethnic minority for that matter) shall not exist in the galactic space empires of the future.&quot; Writing in the African-American newspaper &quot;New Journal and Guide&quot;, Walter Bremond claimed that due to his black garb and his being voiced by a black actor, the villainous Vader reinforces a stereotype that &quot;black is evil&quot;.

The film continues to receive critical acclaim from contemporary critics. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In his 1997 review of the film&#x27;s 20th-anniversary release, Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, calling it and violent epic with a simple and whimsical heart&quot;. A &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; staff member described the film as &quot;a thrilling experience&quot;. In 2001 Matt Ford of the BBC awarded the film five out of five stars and wrote, &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; isn&#x27;t the best film ever made, but it is universally loved.&quot; CinemaScore reported that audiences for the film&#x27;s 1999 re-release gave the film a &quot;A+&quot; grade.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Star Wars&quot; won many awards after its release, including six Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, one Golden Globe Award, three Grammy Awards, one Hugo Award, and thirteen Saturn Awards. Additionally, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave a Special Achievement Academy Award to Ben Burtt, and granted a Scientific and Engineering Award to John Dykstra, Alvah J. Miller, and Jerry Jeffress for the development of the Dykstraflex camera system.

In its May 30, 1977, issue, &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;Star Wars&quot; the &quot;Movie of the Year&quot;. The publication said it was a &quot;big early supporter&quot; of the vision which would become &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In an article intended for the cover of the issue, &quot;Time&quot;″s Gerald Clarke wrote that &quot;Star Wars&quot; is &quot;a grand and glorious film that may well be the smash hit of 1977, and certainly is the best movie of the year so far. The result is a remarkable confection: a subliminal history of the movies, wrapped in a riveting tale of suspense and adventure, ornamented with some of the most ingenious special effects ever contrived for film.&quot; Each of the subsequent films of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga has appeared on the magazine&#x27;s cover.
&quot;Star Wars&quot; was voted the second most popular film by Americans in a 2008 nationwide poll conducted by the market research firm Harris Interactive. It has also been featured in several high-profile audience polls: In 1997, it ranked as the 10th Greatest American Film on the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; Readers&#x27; Poll; in 2002, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; were voted the greatest films ever made in Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films poll; in 2011, it ranked as Best Sci-Fi Film on &quot;Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time&quot;, a primetime special aired by ABC that ranked the best films as chosen by fans, based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and &quot;People&quot; magazine; and in 2014, the film placed 11th in a poll undertaken by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, which balloted every studio, agency, publicity firm, and production house in the Hollywood region.

In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Star Wars&quot; at 22nd on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. In 2010, the film ranked among the &quot;All-Time 100&quot; list of the greatest films as chosen by &quot;Time&quot; film critic Richard Schickel.

Lucas&#x27;s screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America as the 68th greatest of all time. In 1989, the United States Library of Congress named &quot;Star Wars&quot; among its first selections to the National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;; at the time, it was the most recent film to be selected and it was the only film from the 1970s to be chosen. Although Lucas declined to provide the Library with a workable copy of the original film upon request (instead offering the Special Edition), a viewable scan was made of the original copyright deposit print. In 1991, &quot;Star Wars&quot; was one of the first 25 films inducted into the Producers Guild of America&#x27;s Hall of Fame for setting &quot;an enduring standard for American entertainment.&quot; The soundtrack was added to the United States National Recording Registry 15 years later (in 2004). The lack of a commercially available version of the 1977 original theatrical edit of the film since early &#x27;80s VHS releases has spawned numerous restorations by disgruntled fans over the years, such as &quot;Harmy&#x27;s Despecialized Edition&quot;.

In addition to the film&#x27;s multiple awards and nominations, &quot;Star Wars&quot; has also been recognized by the American Film Institute on several of its lists. The film ranks first on 100 Years of Film Scores, second on Top 10 Sci-Fi Films, 15th on 100 Years... 100 Movies (ranked 13th on the updated 10th-anniversary edition), 27th on 100 Years... 100 Thrills, and 39th on 100 Years... 100 Cheers. In addition, the quote &quot;May the Force be with you&quot; is ranked eighth on 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes, and Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi are ranked as the 14th and 37th greatest heroes respectively on 100 Years... 100 Heroes &amp; Villains.

== Post-release ==

=== Theatrical re-releases ===

&quot;Star Wars&quot; was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981, and 1982. The subtitles &quot;Episode IV&quot; and &quot;A New Hope&quot; were added for the 1981 re-release. The subtitles brought the film into line with its 1980 sequel, which was released as &quot;Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Lucas claims the subtitles were intended from the beginning, but were dropped for &quot;Star Wars&quot; to avoid confusing audiences. Kurtz said they considered calling the first film Episode III, IV, or V. Hamill claims that Lucas&#x27;s motivation for starting with Episode IV was to give the audience &quot;a feeling that they&#x27;d missed something&quot;. Another reason Lucas began with Episodes IV–VI, according to Hamill, was because they were the most &quot;commercial&quot; sections of the larger overarching story. Michael Kaminski, however, points out that multiple early screenplay drafts of &quot;Star Wars&quot; carried an &quot;Episode One&quot; subtitle, and that early drafts of &quot;Empire&quot; were called &quot;Episode II&quot;.

In 1997, &quot;Star Wars&quot; was digitally remastered with some altered scenes for a theatrical re-release, dubbed the &quot;Special Edition&quot;. In 2010, Lucas announced that all six previously released &quot;Star Wars&quot; films would be scanned and transferred to 3D for a theatrical release, but only 3D versions of the prequel trilogy were completed before the franchise was sold to Disney in 2012. In 2013, &quot;Star Wars&quot; was dubbed into Navajo, making it the first major motion picture dubbed into the Navajo language.

==== Special Edition ====
After ILM began to create CGI for Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, Lucas decided that digital technology had caught up to his &quot;original vision&quot; for &quot;Star Wars&quot;. For the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 1997, &quot;Star Wars&quot; was digitally remastered with some altered scenes and re-released to theaters, along with &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, under the campaign title &quot;Star Wars&quot; Trilogy: Special Edition. This version of &quot;Star Wars&quot; runs 124 minutes.

The Special Edition contains visual shots and scenes that were unachievable in the original film due to financial, technological, and time constraints. The process of creating the new visual effects was explored in the documentary &quot;Special Effects: Anything Can Happen&quot;, directed by &quot;Star Wars&quot; sound designer Ben Burtt. Although most changes are minor or cosmetic in nature, many fans and critics believe that Lucas degraded the film with the additions. A particularly controversial change in which a bounty hunter named Greedo shoots first when confronting Han Solo has inspired T-shirts bearing the phrase &quot;Han shot first&quot;.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; required extensive recovery of misplaced footage and restoration of the whole film before Lucas&#x27;s Special Edition modifications could be attempted. In addition to the negative film stock commonly used for feature films, Lucas had also used Color Reversal Internegative (CRI) film, a reversal stock subsequently discontinued by Kodak. Although it theoretically was of higher quality, CRI deteriorated faster than negative stocks. Because of this, the entire composited negative had to be disassembled, and the CRI portions cleaned separately from the negative portions. Once the cleaning was complete, the film was scanned into the computer for restoration. In many cases, entire scenes had to be reconstructed from their individual elements. Digital compositing technology allowed the restoration team to correct for problems such as misalignment of mattes and &quot;blue-spill&quot;.

In 1989, the 1977 theatrical version of &quot;Star Wars&quot; was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry of the United States Library of Congress. 35 mm reels of the 1997 Special Edition were initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints, but it was later revealed that the Library possessed a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical release. By 2015, this copy had been transferred to a 2K scan, now available to be viewed by appointment. Shortly after the release of &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,&quot; director Gareth Edwards claimed he viewed a 4K restoration of the original theatrical version of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, created by Disney. The company has never confirmed its existence, however.

=== Home media ===
In the United States, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan, parts of or the whole film were released on Super 8. Clips were also released for the Movie Viewer toy projector by Kenner Products in cassettes featuring short scenes.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; was released on Betamax, CED, LaserDisc, Video 2000, and VHS during the 1980s and 1990s by CBS/Fox Video. The final issue of the original theatrical release (pre-Special Edition) on VHS occurred in 1995, as part of a &quot;Last Chance to Own the Original&quot; campaign, and was available as part of a trilogy set or as a standalone purchase. The film was released for the first time on DVD on September 21, 2004, in a box set with &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and a bonus disc of supplementary material. The films were digitally restored and remastered, and more changes were made by Lucas (in addition to those made for the 1997 Special Edition). The DVD features a commentary track from Lucas, Fisher, Burtt and visual effects artist Dennis Muren. The bonus disc contains the documentary &quot;Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy&quot;, three featurettes, teaser and theatrical trailers, TV spots, image galleries, an exclusive preview of &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot;, a playable Xbox demo of the LucasArts game &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot;, and a making-of documentary about the &quot;Episode III&quot; video game. The set was reissued in December 2005 as a three-disc limited edition without the bonus disc.

The trilogy was re-released on separate two-disc limited edition DVD sets from September 12 to December 31, 2006, and again in a limited edition box set on November 4, 2008; the original theatrical versions of the films were added as bonus material. The release was met with criticism because the unaltered versions were from the 1993 non-anamorphic LaserDisc masters, and were not re-transferred using modern video standards. This led to problems with colors and digital image jarring.

All six existing &quot;Star Wars&quot; films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray on September 16, 2011, in three different editions. &quot;A New Hope&quot; was available in both a box set of the original trilogy and with the other five films in the set &quot;Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot;, which includes nine discs and over 40 hours of special features. The original theatrical versions of the films were not included in the box set. New changes were made to the films, provoking mixed responses from critics and fans alike.

On April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, Twentieth Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six existing &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. Fox released &quot;A New Hope&quot; for digital download on April 10, 2015, while Disney released the other five films. Disney reissued &quot;A New Hope&quot; on Blu-ray, DVD, and for digital download on September 22, 2019. Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service&#x27;s launch on November 12, 2019. This version of &quot;A New Hope&quot; was also released by Disney in a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray box set on March 31, 2020.

=== Merchandising ===

Little &quot;Star Wars&quot; merchandise was available for several months after the film&#x27;s debut, as only Kenner Products had accepted marketing director Charles Lippincott&#x27;s licensing offers. Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its &quot;empty box&quot; Christmas campaign. Television commercials told children and parents that vouchers contained in a &quot;Star Wars Early Bird Certificate Package&quot; could be redeemed for four action figures between February and June 1978. Jay West of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that the boxes in the campaign &quot;became the most coveted empty box[es] in the history of retail.&quot; In 2012, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame.

The novelization of the film was published as &quot;Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker&quot; in December 1976, six months before the film was released. The credited author was George Lucas, but the book was revealed to have been ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster. Marketing director Charles Lippincott secured the deal with Del Rey Books to publish the novelization in November 1976. By February 1977, a half million copies had been sold. Foster also wrote the sequel novel &quot;Splinter of the Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1978) to be adapted as a low-budget film if &quot;Star Wars&quot; was not a financial success.

Marvel Comics also adapted the film as the first six issues of its licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic book, with the first issue sold in April 1977. The comic was written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Howard Chaykin. Like the novelization, it contained certain elements, such as the scene with Luke and Biggs, that appeared in the screenplay but not in the finished film. The series was so successful that, according to comic book writer Jim Shooter, it &quot;single-handedly saved Marvel&quot;. From January to April 1997, Dark Horse Comics, which had held the comic rights to &quot;Star Wars&quot; since 1991, published a comic book adaptation of the &quot;Special Edition&quot; of the film, written by Bruce Jones with art by Eduardo Barreto and Al Williamson; 36 years later, the same company published &quot;The Star Wars&quot;, an adaptation of the plot from Lucas&#x27;s original rough draft screenplay, from September 2013 to May 2014.

Lucasfilm adapted the story for a children&#x27;s book-and-record set. Released in 1979, the 24-page &quot;Star Wars&quot; read-along book was accompanied by a  rpm 7-inch phonograph record. Each page of the book contained a cropped frame from the movie with an abridged and condensed version of the story. The record was produced by Buena Vista Records, and its content was copyrighted by Black Falcon, Ltd., a subsidiary of Lucasfilm &quot;formed to handle the merchandising for &quot;Star Wars&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Story of Star Wars&quot; was a 1977 record album presenting an abridged version of the events depicted in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, using dialogue and sound effects from the original film. The recording was produced by George Lucas and Alan Livingston, and was narrated by Roscoe Lee Browne. The script was adapted by E. Jack Kaplan and Cheryl Gard.

An audio CD boxed set of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; radio series was released in 1993, containing the original 1981 radio drama along with the radio adaptations of the sequels, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

== Legacy and influence ==
Ford, who subsequently starred in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series (1981–2023), &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), and &quot;Witness&quot; (1985), told the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;boosted&quot; his career. The film also spawned the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;, which debuted on CBS on November 17, 1978, and is often considered a failure; Lucas himself disowned it. The special was never aired again after its original broadcast, and it has never been officially released on home video. However, many bootleg copies exist, and it has consequently become something of an underground legend.

=== In popular culture ===

&quot;Star Wars&quot; and its subsequent film installments have been explicitly referenced and satirized across a wide range of media. &quot;Hardware Wars&quot;, released in 1978, was one of the first fan films to parody &quot;Star Wars&quot;. It received positive critical reaction, earned over $1 million, and is one of Lucas&#x27;s favorite &quot;Star Wars&quot; spoofs. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Frank DeCaro said, &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; littered pop culture of the late 1970s with a galaxy of space junk.&quot; He cited &quot;Quark&quot; (a short-lived 1977 sitcom that parodies the science fiction genre) and &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; (a 1970s variety show that featured a 10-minute musical adaptation of &quot;Star Wars&quot; guest starring Daniels and Mayhew) as &quot;television&#x27;s two most infamous examples.&quot; Mel Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, a satirical comic science-fiction parody, was released in 1987 to mixed reviews. Lucas permitted Brooks to make a spoof of the film under &quot;one incredibly big restriction: no action figures.&quot; In the 1990s and 2000s, animated comedy TV series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; produced episodes satirizing the film series. A Nerdist article published in 2021 argues that &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; is the most influential film of all time&quot; partly on the basis that &quot;if all copies... suddenly vanished, we could more or less recreate the film... using other media,&quot; including parodies.

Many elements of &quot;Star Wars&quot; are prominent in popular culture. Darth Vader, Han Solo, and Yoda were all named in the top twenty of the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Best Sci-Fi Characters of All-Time&quot; list. The expressions &quot;Evil empire&quot; and &quot;May the Force be with you&quot; have become part of the popular lexicon. A pun on the latter phrase (&quot;May the Fourth&quot;) has led to May 4 being regarded by many fans as an unofficial &quot;Star Wars&quot; Day. To commemorate the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary in May 2007, the United States Postal Service issued a set of 15 stamps depicting the characters of the franchise. Approximately 400 mailboxes across the country were also designed to look like R2-D2.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; and Lucas are the subject of the 2010 documentary film &quot;The People vs. George Lucas&quot;, which explores filmmaking and fandom as they pertain to the film franchise and its creator.

=== Cinematic influence ===
In his book &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, Roger Ebert called &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;a technical watershed&quot; that influenced many subsequent films. It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon. Along with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot;, it shifted the film industry&#x27;s focus away from the more personal filmmaking of the 1970s towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.

Filmmakers who have been influenced by &quot;Star Wars&quot; include J. J. Abrams, James Cameron, Dean Devlin, Gareth Edwards, Roland Emmerich, David Fincher, Peter Jackson, John Lasseter, Damon Lindelof, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, John Singleton, Kevin Smith, and Joss Whedon. Lucas&#x27;s &quot;used future&quot; concept was employed in Scott&#x27;s &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982); Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984); and Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. Nolan cited &quot;Star Wars&quot; as an influence when making &quot;Inception&quot; (2010).

Some critics have complained that &quot;Star Wars&quot;, as well as &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;ruined&quot; Hollywood by shifting its focus from &quot;sophisticated&quot; films such as &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, and &quot;Annie Hall&quot; to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy. On a 1977 episode of &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, Gene Siskel said he hoped Hollywood would continue to cater to audiences who enjoy &quot;serious pictures&quot;. Peter Biskind claimed that Lucas and Spielberg &quot;returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass.&quot; In contrast, Tom Shone wrote that through &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Jaws&quot;, Lucas and Spielberg did not betray cinema, but instead &quot;plugged it back into the grid, returning it... to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect&quot;, which amounted to &quot;a kind of rebirth.&quot;

== Sequels, prequels, and adaptations ==
&quot;Star Wars&quot; was followed by the sequels &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), which conclude the original film trilogy. Both were financially successful and fared well with critics. The original trilogy is considered one of the best film trilogies in history.

A radio drama adaptation of &quot;Star Wars&quot; was broadcast on the American National Public Radio network in 1981. It was written by Brian Daley and directed by John Madden, and was produced with cooperation from George Lucas, who donated the rights to NPR. Williams&#x27;s music and Burtt&#x27;s sound design were retained for the show, and Hamill and Daniels reprised their roles. The narrative began with a backstory to the film, recounting Leia&#x27;s acquisition of the Death Star plans. It also featured scenes not seen in the final cut of the film, such as Luke&#x27;s observation of the space battle above Tatooine, a skyhopper race, and Vader&#x27;s interrogation of Leia. The radio version was originally part of the official &quot;Star Wars&quot; canon, but has since been supplanted by revised canonical narratives.

More than twenty years after the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Lucas wrote and directed a prequel trilogy, consisting of the films &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005). The trilogy chronicles the history between Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker, and the latter&#x27;s fall to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader. The prequel trilogy was financially successful, but some of the plot threads and new characters polarized critics and fans. After Lucas sold the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise to the Walt Disney Company in 2012, Disney developed a sequel trilogy, consisting of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019). Original trilogy cast members including Ford, Hamill, and Fisher reprised their roles, alongside new characters portrayed by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac. In 2016, Disney released the standalone film &quot;Rogue One&quot;, which depicts the successful Rebel attempt to steal the Death Star plans. It serves as a direct prequel to &quot;Star Wars,&quot; ending where &quot;Star Wars&quot; begins. Other standalone films and television series have also been released.

<doc id="52552" wikidata="Q1077811" url="?curid=52552" title="Axiom of power set">
<text>In mathematics, the axiom of power set is one of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms of axiomatic set theory. It guarantees for every set formula_1 the existence of a set formula_2, the power set of formula_1, consisting precisely of the subsets of formula_1. By the axiom of extensionality, the set formula_2 is unique.

The axiom of power set appears in most axiomatizations of set theory. It is generally considered uncontroversial, although constructive set theory prefers a weaker version to resolve concerns about predicativity.

== Formal statement ==
The subset relation formula_6 is not a primitive notion in formal set theory and is not used in the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. Rather, the subset relation formula_6 is defined in terms of set membership, formula_8. Given this, in the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom of power set reads:
:formula_9
where &quot;y&quot; is the power set of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;z&quot; is any element of &quot;y&quot;, &quot;w&quot; is any member of &quot;z&quot;.

In English, this says:
:Given any set &quot;x&quot;, there is a set &quot;y&quot; such that, given any set &quot;z&quot;, this set &quot;z&quot; is a member of &quot;y&quot; if and only if every element of &quot;z&quot; is also an element of &quot;x&quot;.

== Consequences ==

The power set axiom allows a simple definition of the Cartesian product of two sets formula_10 and formula_11:

:formula_12

Notice that
:formula_13
:formula_14

and, for example, considering a model using the Kuratowski ordered pair,

:formula_15

and thus the Cartesian product is a set since

:formula_16

One may define the Cartesian product of any finite collection of sets recursively:

:formula_17

The existence of the Cartesian product can be proved without using the power set axiom, as in the case of the Kripke–Platek set theory.

== Limitations ==

The power set axiom does not specify what subsets of a set exist, only that there is a set containing all those that do. Not all conceivable subsets are guaranteed to exist. In particular, the power set of an infinite set would contain only &quot;constructible sets&quot; if the universe is the constructible universe but in other models of ZF set theory could contain sets that are not constructible.

<doc id="52553" wikidata="Q1987722" url="?curid=52553" title="Axiom of union">
<text>In axiomatic set theory, the axiom of union is one of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. This axiom was introduced by Ernst Zermelo.

Informally, the axiom states that for each set &quot;x&quot; there is a set &quot;y&quot; whose elements are precisely the elements of the elements of &quot;x&quot;.

== Formal statement ==
In the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads:
:formula_1
or in words:
:Given any set &quot;X&quot;, there is a set &quot;Y&quot; such that, for any element &quot;u&quot;, &quot;u&quot; is a member of &quot;Y&quot; if and only if there is a set &quot;z&quot; such that &quot;u&quot; is a member of &quot;z&quot; and &quot;z&quot; is a member of &quot;X&quot;.
or, more simply:
:For any set formula_2, there is a set formula_3 which consists of just the elements of the elements of that set formula_2.

== Relation to Pairing ==
The axiom of union allows one to unpack a set of sets and thus create a flatter set. 
Together with the axiom of pairing, this implies that for any two sets, there is a set (called their union) that contains exactly the elements of the two sets.

== Relation to Replacement ==
The axiom of replacement allows one to form many unions, such as the union of two sets.

However, in its full generality, the axiom of union is independent from the rest of the ZFC-axioms: 
Replacement does not prove the existence of the union of a set of sets if the result contains an unbounded number of cardinalities.

Together with the axiom schema of replacement, the axiom of union implies that one can form the union of a family of sets indexed by a set.

== Relation to Separation ==
In the context of set theories which include the axiom of separation, the axiom of union is sometimes stated in a weaker form which only produces a superset of the union of a set. For example, Kunen states the axiom as 
: formula_5
which is equivalent to
: formula_6
Compared to the axiom stated at the top of this section, this variation asserts only one direction of the implication, rather than both directions.

== Relation to Intersection ==
There is no corresponding axiom of intersection. If formula_7 is a &quot;nonempty&quot; set containing formula_8, it is possible to form the intersection formula_9 using the axiom schema of specification as
:formula_10,
so no separate axiom of intersection is necessary. (If &quot;A&quot; is the empty set, then trying to form the intersection of &quot;A&quot; as
:{&quot;c&quot;: for all &quot;D&quot; in &quot;A&quot;, &quot;c&quot; is in &quot;D&quot;}
is not permitted by the axioms. Moreover, if such a set existed, then it would contain every set in the &quot;universe&quot;, but the notion of a universal set is antithetical to Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.)

== History ==

=== 1960s: The Defense Communications Agency ===
DCA was established May 12, 1960, with the primary mission of operational control and management of the Defense Communications System (DCS).

The initial headquarters for 34 DCA members was Wake Hall, one of a complex of three buildings (which included Midway Hall and Guam Hall) on the site where the parking lot of the Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington, D.C., stands today. Navy Rear Admiral William D. Irvin became the first DCA director in July. In September, Rear Admiral Irvin moved his staff to office space in Building 12 at the Naval Services Center, 701 Courthouse Road, Arlington, Va., the site of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s old Radio Arlington Station.

DCA&#x27;s first major tasks were to identify the DCS elements and develop an implementation and management plan. The DCS was essentially a collection of communications systems turned over by the military departments with considerable restrictions. Key among these responsibilities was the establishment of three common-user, defense-wide networks that would be known as the Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON), the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN), and the Automatic Secure Voice Communications Network (AUTOSEVOCOM). For each, DCA sought to determine its overall system configuration and prepare the technical specifications necessary for the equipment for switching centers, interconnecting transmission media, and subscriber terminals.

With the arrival of the space-age, DCA was designated as the “strong focal point” for development, integration, and operation of the space and ground elements of a number of satellite-based communications initiatives. The most important of these would be the DCA-managed Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS).

The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 showed the need for direct, timely, and private communications between the leaders of the world&#x27;s two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. A duplex cable circuit (later augmented by a satellite hookup) between the two capitals known as the Moscow–Washington hotline or &quot;Red Telephone&quot;, became operational August 30, 1963. Program management and engineering for the “Hotline” was assigned to DCA. The system continues intact today with direct links to more than 40 foreign leaders. Another direct result of the Cuban Missile Crisis was the creation of the Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS) to enable national command authorities to exercise effective command and control of their widely dispersed forces.

While DCA dealt with the communication crises of the Cold War, a “hot war” was waging in Southeast Asia. America&#x27;s commitment to South Vietnam led to the creation of a DCA Southeast Asia Region unit in 1964. DCA developed a plan to integrate the region&#x27;s communication systems into a single modern network. The system would extend the commercial-quality communications provided by satellites and cables to the battlefield.

=== 1970s ===
DCA assumed responsibility for the Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN), a subsystem of WWMCCS, in December 1971. The MEECN was developed to assure the timely receipt of emergency action messages by worldwide U.S. nuclear forces under nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. DCA served as the MEECN system engineer and provided the broad engineering necessary to ensure a more survivable future network with compatible, interoperable, and secure subsystems.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s DCA, through its NMCS Technical Support Directorate, had responsibility for the technical support, planning, and system engineering for the four command centers then comprising the NMCS. These were the NMCC and the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (these funded by the USAF), the Alternate National Military Command Center (funded by the Army), and the National Emergency Command Post Afloat (funded by the Navy, and deactivated in the late 1960s). DCA performed the requirements collection and analysis, system engineering, funding estimation, subsystem project plan development, and establishment of the initial physical architecture for the expansion of the NMCC that was implemented by the Air Force in the 1970s.

A DoD directive issued in the early 1970s appointed DCA as the system architect for all defense satellite communications. A major new DCA headquarters staff directorate, the Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Office, was created to discharge the new role. As the system architect, DCA coordinated all defense satellite communications planning and programs to avoid duplication and ensure communications interoperability among the diverse systems serving the complete spectrum of defense needs.

=== 1980s ===
The momentum of major improvements in national security telecommunications accelerated rapidly in the 1980s. Along with the unprecedented peacetime military build-up under the Reagan Administration came the proliferation of government-owned and government-leased networks and a high emphasis on interoperability among the military services. The pace of technological advancement brought with it new opportunities for system improvements.

The desire for interoperability in military communications did not originate in the 1980s. The need for communications systems that talked to each other within an individual military service and among the services together went back to the needs generated by the global proportions of WWII. Indeed, it was the lack of interoperability that drove the Eisenhower administration to seek one organization to pull together the services’ disparate systems to speak with one voice – that organization was DCA. But interoperability still had yet to be achieved by the 1980s.

In April 1986, the assistant secretary of defense for command and control, communications and intelligence proposed the consolidation of DCA and the Joint Tactical Command, Control, and Communications Agency (JTC3A) in view of the “climate within DoD of streamlining and reducing overhead functions.” The Joint Staff endorsed the proposal because it also provided some operational efficiency.

In January 1987, the secretary of defense approved the consolidation of DCA and JTC3A. A year later, DCA absorbed the Tri-Service Tactical Communications Joint Test Element and JTC3A Joint Operability Test Facility. DCA consolidated these organizations into a new organization in 1989, establishing the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. JITC provided the facility for DoD and private-sector interoperability compliance testing and certification.

In October 1989, the deputy secretary of defense established a DoD Corporate Information Management (CIM) Initiative to identify and implement management efficiencies in DoD information systems. DCA was given responsibility for implementing the CIM initiative, and its mission was expanded to include information support to the JCS and Office of the Secretary of Defense, tactical information system standards and interoperability, and White House information systems.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990 and 1991, during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, a team of planners, engineers, and operators from DCA&#x27;s Defense Network Systems Organization (DNSO) assisted in the design of a semi-fixed telecommunications system, the Southwest Asia Telecommunications (SATS) for use in support of the theater commander&#x27;s operations. SATS included satellite, microwave, copper cable, and fiber optic links; Defense Data Network packet-switching nodes; Defense Switched Network (DSN) multi-function voice switches; and technical control facilities. At their peak, these systems included more than 100 satellite links.

On June 25, 1991, DCA underwent a major reorganization and was renamed the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to reflect its expanded role in implementing the DoD&#x27;s CIM (Corporate Information Management) initiative and to clearly identify DISA as a combat support agency. DISA established the Center for Information Management to provide technical and program execution assistance to the assistant secretary of defense (C3I) and technical products and services to DoD and military components.

DISA&#x27;s role in DoD information management continued to expand with implementation of several Defense Management Report Decisions (DMRD ), most notably DMRD 918, in September 1992. DMRD 918 created the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) and directed DISA to manage and consolidate the Services’ and DoD&#x27;s information processing centers into 16 mega-centers. During the 1990s, DISA fielded new systems to support the combatant commands. The Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and the Joint Chiefs’ C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) for the Warrior, and the Defense Message System were among the critical systems. GCCS was developed to replace WWMCCS, which had been in existence since the early 1960s.

=== 2000s ===
With the new century, DISA faced even greater challenges as a DoD service provider. Preserving radio spectrum, information assurance, ensuring interoperability, and establishing secure wireless links were just some of the tasks performed by the agency. Perhaps the most significant achievement of the agency in 2001 was its immediate response in the aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. DISA justified $300 million in supplemental funds to support the Global War on Terrorism by providing critical communications paths and command and control enhancements for warfighters.

In the 18 months between September 2001 and April 2003, DISA supported the exponential use and increased capacity of information systems. The Defense Switched Network (DSN) infrastructure increased 400 percent. The Secret Internet Protocol (IP) Data Service (formerly known as the SIPRNet) capacity increased 292 percent. Sensitive but Unclassified Internet Protocol (IP) Data Service (formerly known as NIPRNet) capacity increased 509 percent. The Defense Video System Global (Secure) increased 1,150 percent. Satellite bandwidth increased 800 percent. The Enhanced Mobile Satellite Service (EMSS) capacity increased 300 percent, and usage increased 3,000 percent. EMSS allowed Special Operations forces to even call in air strikes from horseback in Afghanistan by permitting instantaneous communications in areas without any infrastructure whatsoever.

For Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, DISA provided 30 times more bandwidth to a 45-percent smaller force than in Operation Desert Storm in 1991. DISA facilitated multiple enhancements to the nation&#x27;s preeminent joint command-and-control system and provided a real-time battle space picture.

After the previous consolidation of 194 data-processing centers in the 1990s into 16 computing mega-centers, DISA further reduced the number of mega-centers from 16 to six.
Starting in 2003, DISA managed the six-year, $326 million effort to completely modernize presidential communications — the largest such initiative in the 61-year history of the White House Communications Agency. The “Pioneer Program” transformed presidential communications by employing net-centric concepts to put voice, video, and data at the president&#x27;s fingertips on an around-the-clock basis.

The Global Information Grid Bandwidth Expansion (GIG-BE) Program was a major DoD net-centric transformational initiative executed by DISA. The $877 million program was the largest DoD information technology transport structure ever built. GIG-BE created a ubiquitous &quot;bandwidth-available&quot; environment to improve national security intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, information assurance, and command and control at locations worldwide. On Dec. 20, 2005, the GIG-BE program achieved the milestone of full operational capability at all of the almost 100 Joint Staff-approved sites.

=== 2010s ===
DISA&#x27;s 50 years of service as the Defense Communications Agency and later the Defense Information Systems Agency was recognized May 12, 2010, during an anniversary celebration at Seven Skyline Place, Falls Church, Va. Army LTG Carroll F. Pollett, the DISA director at the time, led the celebration of the agency&#x27;s storied past.

From 2008 through 2010, DISA worked directly with the commander, United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), to design and implement a high-capacity, strategic communication network into an active Theater of Operations, ensuring reliable communications for intra-theater mission partners and to national leadership. Prior to this installation, the coalition forces in Afghanistan were dependent on satellite communications and tactical microwave links, which had limited bandwidth capacity and induced significant delay.

DISA operated and defended the Global Information Grid (GIG), providing information capabilities with a reach from the White House to forces at the tactical edge. DISA supported execution of military operations while simultaneously supporting peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and disaster-relief missions in multiple theaters around the globe. During a 4-month period in 2011, DISA provided support to an unprecedented six simultaneous operations: Operation NEW DAWN in Iraq; Operation ENDURING FREEDOM in Afghanistan; Operation UNIFIED RESPONSE in Haiti; Operation ODYSSEY DAWN and NATO Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR in Libya, Operation TOMODACHI in Japan; and DISA&#x27;s global cyber operations in support of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).

=== 2020s ===

Computer systems controlled by DISA were hacked in the summer of 2019, and was reported in February 2020, exposing the personal data of about 200,000 people including names and social security numbers.

The US Army is seeking to reduce its NIPRNet footprint by 2023 and its SIPRnet footprint by 2024.

== List of directors ==
== Military Unit Decorations ==
The unit awards below are issued to Headquarters, Defense Information Systems Agency and subordinate units unless otherwise noted.

Members of military-specific units (i.e., Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force) assigned or attached, even if they are under the operational control, are not eligible for the Joint Meritorious Unit Award (JMUA), but retain eligibility for unit awards from their respective military service department.

Members must have been permanently assigned or attached by official orders to the agency for 30 or more days during the designated award period. Service members individually assigned or attached (including temporary duty or temporary additional duty) status is determined by official orders that specify the agency as the duty unit. Some military services allow the “temporary-wear” of past unit citations when assigned to the organization. The JMUA is an exception to this rule and is not authorized for temporary wear.

<text>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ), also known as the Justice Department, is a federal executive department of the U.S. government that oversees the domestic enforcement of federal laws and the administration of justice. It is equivalent to the justice or interior ministries of other countries. The department is headed by the U.S. attorney general, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president&#x27;s Cabinet. Pam Bondi has served as U.S. attorney general since February 4, 2025.

The Justice Department contains most of the United States&#x27; federal law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The department also has eight divisions of lawyers who represent the federal government in litigation: the Criminal, Civil, Antitrust, Tax, Civil Rights, Environment and Natural Resources, National Security, and Justice Management Divisions. The DOJ includes the U.S. Attorneys&#x27; Offices for each of the 94 U.S. federal judicial districts.

The U.S. Congress created the Justice Department in 1870, during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. Its functions originally date to 1789, when Congress created the office of the Attorney General.

==History==
The office of the attorney general was established by the Judiciary Act of 1789 as a part-time job for one person, but grew with the bureaucracy. At one time, the attorney general gave legal advice to the U.S. Congress, as well as the president; however, in 1819, the attorney general began advising Congress alone to ensure a manageable workload. Until 1853, the salary of the attorney general was set by statute at less than the amount paid to other Cabinet members. Early attorneys general supplemented their salaries by running private law practices, often arguing cases before the courts as attorneys for paying litigants. The lightness of the office is exemplified by Edward Bates (1793–1869), attorney general under President Abraham Lincoln (1861–1864). Bates had only a small operation, with a staff of just six. Their main function was to generate legal opinions at the request of Lincoln and cabinet members, and handle occasional cases before the Supreme Court. Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet was full of experienced lawyers who seldom felt the need to ask for his opinions. In addition, Bates had no authority over the US Attorneys around the country. The federal court system was handled by the Department of the Interior, and the Department of the Treasury handled claims. Most of the opinions turned out by Bates&#x27;s office were of minor importance. Lincoln gave him no special assignments and did not seek his advice on Supreme Court appointments. Bates did have an opportunity to comment on general policy as a cabinet member with a strong political base, but he seldom spoke up.

Following unsuccessful efforts in 1830 and 1846 to make attorney general a full-time job, in 1867, the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary, led by Congressman William Lawrence, conducted an inquiry into the creation of a &quot;law department&quot; headed by the attorney general and also composed of the various department solicitors and United States attorneys. On February 19, 1868, Lawrence introduced a bill in Congress to create the Department of Justice. President Ulysses S. Grant signed the bill into law on June 22, 1870.

Grant appointed Amos T. Akerman as attorney general and Benjamin H. Bristow as America&#x27;s first solicitor general the same week that Congress created the Department of Justice. The Department&#x27;s immediate function was to preserve civil rights. It set about fighting against domestic terrorist groups who had been using both violence and litigation to oppose the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution.
Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute Ku Klux Klan members in the early 1870s. In the first few years of Grant&#x27;s first term in office, there were 1000 indictments against Klan members, with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice. By 1871, there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions, with most only serving brief sentences, while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in Albany, New York. The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South. Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was &quot;better&quot; or &quot;stronger&quot; than Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists. George H. Williams, who succeeded Akerman in December 1871, continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the spring of 1873, during Grant&#x27;s second term in office. Williams then placed a moratorium on Klan prosecutions partially because the Justice Department, inundated by cases involving the Klan, did not have the manpower to continue prosecutions.

The &quot;Act to Establish the Department of Justice&quot; drastically increased the attorney general&#x27;s responsibilities to include the supervision of all United States attorneys, formerly under the Department of the Interior, the prosecution of all federal crimes, and the representation of the United States in all court actions, barring the use of private attorneys by the federal government. The law also created the office of Solicitor General to supervise and conduct government litigation in the Supreme Court of the United States.

The organization of the department was a part of the general effort to control patronage, retrenchment in the workforce, and to improve the status of lawyers.

With the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, the federal government took on some law enforcement responsibilities, and the Department of Justice was tasked with performing these.

In 1884, control of federal prisons was transferred to the new department, from the Department of the Interior. New facilities were built, including the penitentiary at Leavenworth in 1895, and a facility for women located in West Virginia, at Alderson was established in 1924.

In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order which gave the Department of Justice responsibility for the &quot;functions of prosecuting in the courts of the United States claims and demands by, and offsenses [&quot;sic&quot;] against, the Government of the United States, and of defending claims and demands against the Government, and of supervising the work of United States attorneys, marshals, and clerks in connection therewith, now exercised by any agency or officer...&quot;

==Headquarters==
The U.S. Department of Justice building was completed in 1935 from a design by Milton Bennett Medary. Upon Medary&#x27;s death in 1929, the other partners of his Philadelphia firm Zantzinger, Borie and Medary took over the project. On a lot bordered by Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues and Ninth and Tenth Streets, Northwest, it holds over of space.

Various efforts, none entirely successful, have been made to determine the original intended meaning of the Latin motto appearing on the Department of Justice seal, &quot;Qui Pro Domina Justitia Sequitur&quot; (literally &quot;Who For Lady Justice Strives&quot;). It is not even known exactly when the original version of the DOJ seal itself was adopted, or when the motto first appeared on the seal. The most authoritative opinion of the DOJ suggests that the motto refers to the Attorney General (and thus, by extension, to the Department of Justice) &quot;who prosecutes on behalf of justice (or the Lady Justice)&quot;.

The motto&#x27;s conception of the prosecutor (or government attorney) as being the servant of justice itself finds concrete expression in a similarly-ordered English-language inscription (&quot;THE UNITED STATES WINS ITS POINT WHENEVER JUSTICE IS DONE ITS CITIZENS IN THE COURTS&quot;) in the above-door paneling in the ceremonial rotunda anteroom just outside the Attorney General&#x27;s office in the Department of Justice Main Building in Washington, D.C. The building was renamed in honor of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy in 2001. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Main Justice&quot;.

===Leadership offices===
*Office of the Attorney General
*Office of the Deputy Attorney General
*Office of the Associate Attorney General
**Office of the United States Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General
*Office of the Solicitor General of the United States

===Divisions===
The Justice Department also had a War Division during World War II. It was created in 1942 and disestablished in 1945.

=== Law enforcement agencies ===
Several federal law enforcement agencies are administered by the Department of Justice:
*United States Marshals Service (USMS) – The office of U.S. Marshal was established by the Judiciary Act of 1789. The U.S. Marshals Service was established as an agency in 1969, and it was elevated to full bureau status under the Justice Department in 1974.
*Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) – On July 26, 1908, a small investigative force was created within the Justice Department under Attorney General Charles Bonaparte. The following year, this force was officially named the Bureau of Investigation by Attorney General George W. Wickersham. In 1935, the bureau adopted its current name.
*Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) – the Three Prisons Act of 1891 created the federal prison system. Congress created the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1930 by Pub. L. No. 71–218, 46 Stat. 325, signed into law by President Hoover on May 14, 1930.
*National Institute of Corrections (NIC) – Founded in 1974, the National Institute of Corrections is organized under the Federal Bureau of Prisons and has a legislatively mandated mission to assist state and local correctional institutions, and to manage the American Federal Prison System by keeping records of inmates.
*Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) – Except for a brief period during Prohibition, ATF&#x27;s predecessor bureaus were part of the Department of the Treasury for more than two hundred years. ATF was first established by Department of Treasury Order No. 221, effective July 1, 1972; this order &quot;transferred the functions, powers, and duties arising under laws relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives from the Internal Revenue Service to ATF. In 2003, under the terms of the Homeland Security Act, ATF was split into two agencies – the new Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) was transferred to the Department of Justice, while the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) was retained by the Department of the Treasury.
*Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) – Created in 1973 as part of the war on drugs, the DEA was formed from various previously existing law enforcement agencies that were parts of either the Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury or the Food and Drug Administration. The DEA enforces the Controlled Substances Act and also interdicts foreign drug trafficking.
*Office of the Inspector General (OIG) – The Office of Inspector General performs basic internal auditing functions, and has the power to make arrests and prosecute members of the Department of Justice who are found to be in violation of laws regulating conduct of government officials.

In March 2003, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service was abolished and its functions transferred to the United States Department of Homeland Security. The Executive Office for Immigration Review and the Board of Immigration Appeals, which review decisions made by government officials under Immigration and Nationality law, remain under jurisdiction of the Department of Justice. Similarly the Office of Domestic Preparedness left the Justice Department for the Department of Homeland Security, but only for executive purposes. The Office of Domestic Preparedness is still centralized within the Department of Justice, since its personnel are still officially employed within the Department of Justice.

In 2003, the Department of Justice created LifeAndLiberty.gov, a website that supported the USA PATRIOT Act. It was criticized by government watchdog groups for its alleged violation of U.S. Code Title 18 Section 1913, which forbids money appropriated by Congress to be used to lobby in favor of any law, actual or proposed. The website has since been taken offline.

On October 5, 2021, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco has announced the formation of a &quot;Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team&quot; during the Aspen Cyber Summit.

<text>In mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which involves a multivariable function and one or more of its partial derivatives.

The function is often thought of as an &quot;unknown&quot; that solves the equation, similar to how is thought of as an unknown number solving, e.g., an algebraic equation like . However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulae for solutions of partial differential equations. There is correspondingly a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific research on methods to numerically approximate solutions of certain partial differential equations using computers. Partial differential equations also occupy a large sector of pure mathematical research, in which the usual questions are, broadly speaking, on the identification of general qualitative features of solutions of various partial differential equations, such as existence, uniqueness, regularity and stability. Among the many open questions are the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, named as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000.

Partial differential equations are ubiquitous in mathematically oriented scientific fields, such as physics and engineering. For instance, they are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics (Schrödinger equation, Pauli equation etc.). They also arise from many purely mathematical considerations, such as differential geometry and the calculus of variations; among other notable applications, they are the fundamental tool in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture from geometric topology.

Partly due to this variety of sources, there is a wide spectrum of different types of partial differential equations, where the meaning of a solution depends on the context of the problem, and methods have been developed for dealing with many of the individual equations which arise. As such, it is usually acknowledged that there is no &quot;universal theory&quot; of partial differential equations, with specialist knowledge being somewhat divided between several essentially distinct subfields.

Ordinary differential equations can be viewed as a subclass of partial differential equations, corresponding to functions of a single variable. Stochastic partial differential equations and nonlocal equations are, as of 2020, particularly widely studied extensions of the &quot;PDE&quot; notion. More classical topics, on which there is still much active research, include elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, Boltzmann equations, and dispersive partial differential equations.

== Introduction ==
A function of three variables is &quot;harmonic&quot; or &quot;a solution of the Laplace equation&quot; if it satisfies the condition
formula_1
Such functions were widely studied in the 19th century due to their relevance for classical mechanics, for example the equilibrium temperature distribution of a homogeneous solid is a harmonic function. If explicitly given a function, it is usually a matter of straightforward computation to check whether or not it is harmonic. For instance
formula_2 and formula_3
are both harmonic while
formula_4
is not. It may be surprising that the two examples of harmonic functions are of such strikingly different form. This is a reflection of the fact that they are &quot;not&quot;, in any immediate way, special cases of a &quot;general solution formula&quot; of the Laplace equation. This is in striking contrast to the case of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) roughly similar to the Laplace equation, with the aim of many introductory textbooks being to find algorithms leading to general solution formulas. For the Laplace equation, as for a large number of partial differential equations, such solution formulas fail to exist.

The nature of this failure can be seen more concretely in the case of the following PDE: for a function of two variables, consider the equation
formula_5
It can be directly checked that any function of the form , for any single-variable functions and whatsoever, will satisfy this condition. This is far beyond the choices available in ODE solution formulas, which typically allow the free choice of some numbers. In the study of PDEs, one generally has the free choice of functions.

The nature of this choice varies from PDE to PDE. To understand it for any given equation, &quot;existence and uniqueness theorems&quot; are usually important organizational principles. In many introductory textbooks, the role of existence and uniqueness theorems for ODE can be somewhat opaque; the existence half is usually unnecessary, since one can directly check any proposed solution formula, while the uniqueness half is often only present in the background in order to ensure that a proposed solution formula is as general as possible. By contrast, for PDE, existence and uniqueness theorems are often the only means by which one can navigate through the plethora of different solutions at hand. For this reason, they are also fundamental when carrying out a purely numerical simulation, as one must have an understanding of what data is to be prescribed by the user and what is to be left to the computer to calculate.

To discuss such existence and uniqueness theorems, it is necessary to be precise about the domain of the &quot;unknown function&quot;. Otherwise, speaking only in terms such as &quot;a function of two variables&quot;, it is impossible to meaningfully formulate the results. That is, the domain of the unknown function must be regarded as part of the structure of the PDE itself.

The following provides two classic examples of such existence and uniqueness theorems. Even though the two PDE in question are so similar, there is a striking difference in behavior: for the first PDE, one has the free prescription of a single function, while for the second PDE, one has the free prescription of two functions.
* Let denote the unit-radius disk around the origin in the plane. For any continuous function on the unit circle, there is exactly one function on such that formula_6 and whose restriction to the unit circle is given by .
* For any functions and on the real line , there is exactly one function on such that formula_7 and with and for all values of .
Even more phenomena are possible. For instance, the following PDE, arising naturally in the field of differential geometry, illustrates an example where there is a simple and completely explicit solution formula, but with the free choice of only three numbers and not even one function.
* If is a function on with formula_8 then there are numbers , , and with .
In contrast to the earlier examples, this PDE is nonlinear, owing to the square roots and the squares. A linear PDE is one such that, if it is homogeneous, the sum of any two solutions is also a solution, and any constant multiple of any solution is also a solution.

== Definition ==
A partial differential equation is an equation that involves an unknown function of formula_9 variables and (some of) its partial derivatives. That is, for the unknown function
formula_10
of variables formula_11 belonging to the open subset formula_12 of formula_13, the formula_14-order partial differential equation is defined as 
formula_15
where
formula_16
and formula_17 is the partial derivative operator.

=== Notation ===

When writing PDEs, it is common to denote partial derivatives using subscripts. For example:
formula_18
In the general situation that is a function of variables, then denotes the first partial derivative relative to the -th input, denotes the second partial derivative relative to the -th and -th inputs, and so on.

The Greek letter denotes the Laplace operator; if is a function of variables, then
formula_19
In the physics literature, the Laplace operator is often denoted by ; in the mathematics literature, may also denote the Hessian matrix of .

== Classification ==

=== Linear and nonlinear equations ===

A PDE is called linear if it is linear in the unknown and its derivatives. For example, for a function of and , a second order linear PDE is of the form
formula_20
where and are functions of the independent variables and only. (Often the mixed-partial derivatives and will be equated, but this is not required for the discussion of linearity.)
If the are constants (independent of and ) then the PDE is called linear with constant coefficients. If is zero everywhere then the linear PDE is homogeneous, otherwise it is inhomogeneous. (This is separate from asymptotic homogenization, which studies the effects of high-frequency oscillations in the coefficients upon solutions to PDEs.)

Nearest to linear PDEs are semi-linear PDEs, where only the highest order derivatives appear as linear terms, with coefficients that are functions of the independent variables. The lower order derivatives and the unknown function may appear arbitrarily. For example, a general second order semi-linear PDE in two variables is
formula_21

In a quasilinear PDE the highest order derivatives likewise appear only as linear terms, but with coefficients possibly functions of the unknown and lower-order derivatives:
formula_22
Many of the fundamental PDEs in physics are quasilinear, such as the Einstein equations of general relativity and the Navier–Stokes equations describing fluid motion.

A PDE without any linearity properties is called fully nonlinear, and possesses nonlinearities on one or more of the highest-order derivatives. An example is the Monge–Ampère equation, which arises in differential geometry.

=== Second order equations ===
The elliptic/parabolic/hyperbolic classification provides a guide to appropriate initial- and boundary conditions and to the smoothness of the solutions. Assuming , the general linear second-order PDE in two independent variables has the form
formula_23
where the coefficients , , ... may depend upon and . If over a region of the -plane, the PDE is second-order in that region. This form is analogous to the equation for a conic section:
formula_24

More precisely, replacing by , and likewise for other variables (formally this is done by a Fourier transform), converts a constant-coefficient PDE into a polynomial of the same degree, with the terms of the highest degree (a homogeneous polynomial, here a quadratic form) being most significant for the classification.

Just as one classifies conic sections and quadratic forms into parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic based on the discriminant , the same can be done for a second-order PDE at a given point. However, the discriminant in a PDE is given by due to the convention of the term being rather than ; formally, the discriminant (of the associated quadratic form) is , with the factor of 4 dropped for simplicity.

# (&quot;elliptic partial differential equation&quot;): Solutions of elliptic PDEs are as smooth as the coefficients allow, within the interior of the region where the equation and solutions are defined. For example, solutions of Laplace&#x27;s equation are analytic within the domain where they are defined, but solutions may assume boundary values that are not smooth. The motion of a fluid at subsonic speeds can be approximated with elliptic PDEs, and the Euler–Tricomi equation is elliptic where . By change of variables, the equation can always be expressed in the form: formula_25where x and y correspond to changed variables. This justifies Laplace equation as an example of this type.
# (&quot;parabolic partial differential equation&quot;): Equations that are parabolic at every point can be transformed into a form analogous to the heat equation by a change of independent variables. Solutions smooth out as the transformed time variable increases. The Euler–Tricomi equation has parabolic type on the line where . By change of variables, the equation can always be expressed in the form: formula_26where x correspond to changed variables. This justifies heat equation, which are of form formula_27, as an example of this type.
# (&quot;hyperbolic partial differential equation&quot;): hyperbolic equations retain any discontinuities of functions or derivatives in the initial data. An example is the wave equation. The motion of a fluid at supersonic speeds can be approximated with hyperbolic PDEs, and the Euler–Tricomi equation is hyperbolic where . By change of variables, the equation can always be expressed in the form: formula_28where x and y correspond to changed variables. This justifies wave equation as an example of this type.

If there are independent variables , a general linear partial differential equation of second order has the form
formula_29

The classification depends upon the signature of the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix .

# Elliptic: the eigenvalues are all positive or all negative.
# Parabolic: the eigenvalues are all positive or all negative, except one that is zero.
# Hyperbolic: there is only one negative eigenvalue and all the rest are positive, or there is only one positive eigenvalue and all the rest are negative.
# Ultrahyperbolic: there is more than one positive eigenvalue and more than one negative eigenvalue, and there are no zero eigenvalues.

The theory of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations have been studied for centuries, largely centered around or based upon the standard examples of the Laplace equation, the heat equation, and the wave equation. 

However, the classification only depends on linearity of the second-order terms and is therefore applicable to semi- and quasilinear PDEs as well. The basic types also extend to hybrids such as the Euler–Tricomi equation; varying from elliptic to hyperbolic for different regions of the domain, as well as higher-order PDEs, but such knowledge is more specialized.

=== Systems of first-order equations and characteristic surfaces ===
The classification of partial differential equations can be extended to systems of first-order equations, where the unknown is now a vector with components, and the coefficient matrices are by matrices for . The partial differential equation takes the form
formula_30
where the coefficient matrices and the vector may depend upon and . If a hypersurface is given in the implicit form
formula_31
where has a non-zero gradient, then is a characteristic surface for the operator at a given point if the characteristic form vanishes:
formula_32

The geometric interpretation of this condition is as follows: if data for are prescribed on the surface , then it may be possible to determine the normal derivative of on from the differential equation. If the data on and the differential equation determine the normal derivative of on , then is non-characteristic. If the data on and the differential equation &quot;do not&quot; determine the normal derivative of on , then the surface is characteristic, and the differential equation restricts the data on : the differential equation is &quot;internal&quot; to .

# A first-order system is &quot;elliptic&quot; if no surface is characteristic for : the values of on and the differential equation always determine the normal derivative of on .
# A first-order system is &quot;hyperbolic&quot; at a point if there is a spacelike surface with normal at that point. This means that, given any non-trivial vector orthogonal to , and a scalar multiplier , the equation has real roots . The system is strictly hyperbolic if these roots are always distinct. The geometrical interpretation of this condition is as follows: the characteristic form defines a cone (the normal cone) with homogeneous coordinates ζ. In the hyperbolic case, this cone has sheets, and the axis runs inside these sheets: it does not intersect any of them. But when displaced from the origin by η, this axis intersects every sheet. In the elliptic case, the normal cone has no real sheets.
== Analytical solutions ==

===Separation of variables===

Linear PDEs can be reduced to systems of ordinary differential equations by the important technique of separation of variables. This technique rests on a feature of solutions to differential equations: if one can find any solution that solves the equation and satisfies the boundary conditions, then it is &quot;the&quot; solution (this also applies to ODEs). We assume as an ansatz that the dependence of a solution on the parameters space and time can be written as a product of terms that each depend on a single parameter, and then see if this can be made to solve the problem.

In the method of separation of variables, one reduces a PDE to a PDE in fewer variables, which is an ordinary differential equation if in one variable – these are in turn easier to solve.

This is possible for simple PDEs, which are called separable partial differential equations, and the domain is generally a rectangle (a product of intervals). Separable PDEs correspond to diagonal matrices – thinking of &quot;the value for fixed &quot; as a coordinate, each coordinate can be understood separately.

This generalizes to the method of characteristics, and is also used in integral transforms.

===Method of characteristics===

The characteristic surface in dimensional space is called a characteristic curve. 
In special cases, one can find characteristic curves on which the first-order PDE reduces to an ODE – changing coordinates in the domain to straighten these curves allows separation of variables, and is called the method of characteristics.

More generally, applying the method to first-order PDEs in higher dimensions, one may find characteristic surfaces.

===Integral transform===
An integral transform may transform the PDE to a simpler one, in particular, a separable PDE. This corresponds to diagonalizing an operator.

An important example of this is Fourier analysis, which diagonalizes the heat equation using the eigenbasis of sinusoidal waves.

If the domain is finite or periodic, an infinite sum of solutions such as a Fourier series is appropriate, but an integral of solutions such as a Fourier integral is generally required for infinite domains. The solution for a point source for the heat equation given above is an example of the use of a Fourier integral.

===Change of variables===

Often a PDE can be reduced to a simpler form with a known solution by a suitable change of variables. For example, the Black–Scholes equation
formula_33
is reducible to the heat equation
formula_34
by the change of variables
formula_35

===Fundamental solution===

Inhomogeneous equations can often be solved (for constant coefficient PDEs, always be solved) by finding the fundamental solution (the solution for a point source formula_36), then taking the convolution with the boundary conditions to get the solution.

This is analogous in signal processing to understanding a filter by its impulse response.

===Superposition principle===

The superposition principle applies to any linear system, including linear systems of PDEs. A common visualization of this concept is the interaction of two waves in phase being combined to result in a greater amplitude, for example . The same principle can be observed in PDEs where the solutions may be real or complex and additive. If and are solutions of linear PDE in some function space , then with any constants and are also a solution of that PDE in the same function space.

===Methods for non-linear equations===
There are no generally applicable analytical methods to solve nonlinear PDEs. Still, existence and uniqueness results (such as the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem) are often possible, as are proofs of important qualitative and quantitative properties of solutions (getting these results is a major part of analysis).

Nevertheless, some techniques can be used for several types of equations. The -principle is the most powerful method to solve underdetermined equations. The Riquier–Janet theory is an effective method for obtaining information about many analytic overdetermined systems.

The method of characteristics can be used in some very special cases to solve nonlinear partial differential equations.

In some cases, a PDE can be solved via perturbation analysis in which the solution is considered to be a correction to an equation with a known solution. Alternatives are numerical analysis techniques from simple finite difference schemes to the more mature multigrid and finite element methods. Many interesting problems in science and engineering are solved in this way using computers, sometimes high performance supercomputers.

===Lie group method===
From 1870 Sophus Lie&#x27;s work put the theory of differential equations on a more satisfactory foundation. He showed that the integration theories of the older mathematicians can, by the introduction of what are now called Lie groups, be referred, to a common source; and that ordinary differential equations which admit the same infinitesimal transformations present comparable difficulties of integration. He also emphasized the subject of transformations of contact.

A general approach to solving PDEs uses the symmetry property of differential equations, the continuous infinitesimal transformations of solutions to solutions (Lie theory). Continuous group theory, Lie algebras and differential geometry are used to understand the structure of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations for generating integrable equations, to find its Lax pairs, recursion operators, Bäcklund transform and finally finding exact analytic solutions to the PDE.

Symmetry methods have been recognized to study differential equations arising in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other disciplines.

===Semi-analytical methods===
The Adomian decomposition method, the Lyapunov artificial small parameter method, and his homotopy perturbation method are all special cases of the more general homotopy analysis method. These are series expansion methods, and except for the Lyapunov method, are independent of small physical parameters as compared to the well known perturbation theory, thus giving these methods greater flexibility and solution generality.

== Numerical solutions ==
The three most widely used numerical methods to solve PDEs are the finite element method (FEM), finite volume methods (FVM) and finite difference methods (FDM), as well other kind of methods called meshfree methods, which were made to solve problems where the aforementioned methods are limited. The FEM has a prominent position among these methods and especially its exceptionally efficient higher-order version hp-FEM. Other hybrid versions of FEM and Meshfree methods include the generalized finite element method (GFEM), extended finite element method (XFEM), spectral finite element method (SFEM), meshfree finite element method, discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM), element-free Galerkin method (EFGM), interpolating element-free Galerkin method (IEFGM), etc.

=== Finite element method ===

The finite element method (FEM) (its practical application often known as finite element analysis (FEA)) is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDE) as well as of integral equations. The solution approach is based either on eliminating the differential equation completely (steady state problems), or rendering the PDE into an approximating system of ordinary differential equations, which are then numerically integrated using standard techniques such as Euler&#x27;s method, Runge–Kutta, etc.

===Finite difference method===

Finite-difference methods are numerical methods for approximating the solutions to differential equations using finite difference equations to approximate derivatives.

=== Finite volume method ===

Similar to the finite difference method or finite element method, values are calculated at discrete places on a meshed geometry. &quot;Finite volume&quot; refers to the small volume surrounding each node point on a mesh. In the finite volume method, surface integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to volume integrals, using the divergence theorem. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods conserve mass by design.

=== Neural networks ===
== Weak solutions ==

Weak solutions are functions that satisfy the PDE, yet in other meanings than regular sense. The meaning for this term may differ with context, and one of the most commonly used definitions is based on the notion of distributions.

An example for the definition of a weak solution is as follows: 

Consider the boundary-value problem given by:
formula_37 
where formula_38 denotes a second-order partial differential operator in divergence form. 

We say a formula_39 is a weak solution if
formula_40 for every formula_41, which can be derived by a formal integral by parts.

An example for a weak solution is as follows:
formula_42 is a weak solution satisfying 
formula_43 in distributional sense, as formally, formula_44

== Theoretical Studies ==
As a branch of pure mathematics, the theoretical studies of PDEs focus on the criteria for a solution to exist, the properties of a solution, and finding its formula is often secondary.

=== Well-posedness ===

Well-posedness refers to a common schematic package of information about a PDE. To say that a PDE is well-posed, one must have:
* an existence and uniqueness theorem, asserting that by the prescription of some freely chosen functions, one can single out one specific solution of the PDE
* by continuously changing the free choices, one continuously changes the corresponding solution
This is, by the necessity of being applicable to several different PDE, somewhat vague. The requirement of &quot;continuity&quot;, in particular, is ambiguous, since there are usually many inequivalent means by which it can be rigorously defined. It is, however, somewhat unusual to study a PDE without specifying a way in which it is well-posed.

=== Regularity ===

Regularity refers to the integrability and differentiability of weak solutions, which can often be represented by Sobolev spaces. 

This problem arise due to the difficulty in searching for classical solutions. Researchers often tend to find weak solutions at first and then find out whether it is smooth enough to be qualified as a classical solution.

Results from functional analysis are often used in this field of study.

<text>In mathematics, a partial derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant (as opposed to the total derivative, in which all variables are allowed to vary). Partial derivatives are used in vector calculus and differential geometry.

The partial derivative of a function formula_1 with respect to the variable formula_2 is variously denoted by

It can be thought of as the rate of change of the function in the formula_2-direction.

Sometimes, for the partial derivative of formula_4 with respect to formula_2 is denoted as formula_6 Since a partial derivative generally has the same arguments as the original function, its functional dependence is sometimes explicitly signified by the notation, such as in:

formula_7

The symbol used to denote partial derivatives is ∂. One of the first known uses of this symbol in mathematics is by Marquis de Condorcet from 1770, who used it for partial differences. The modern partial derivative notation was created by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1786), although he later abandoned it; Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi reintroduced the symbol in 1841.

==Definition==
Like ordinary derivatives, the partial derivative is defined as a limit. Let be an open subset of formula_8 and formula_9 a function. The partial derivative of at the point formula_10 with respect to the -th variable is defined as

formula_11

Where formula_12 is the unit vector of -th variable . Even if all partial derivatives formula_13 exist at a given point , the function need not be continuous there. However, if all partial derivatives exist in a neighborhood of and are continuous there, then is totally differentiable in that neighborhood and the total derivative is continuous. In this case, it is said that is a function. This can be used to generalize for vector valued functions, by carefully using a componentwise argument.

The partial derivative formula_14 can be seen as another function defined on and can again be partially differentiated. If the direction of derivative is repeated, it is called a mixed partial derivative. If all mixed second order partial derivatives are continuous at a point (or on a set), is termed a function at that point (or on that set); in this case, the partial derivatives can be exchanged by Clairaut&#x27;s theorem:

formula_15

==Notation==

For the following examples, let be a function in , , and .

First-order partial derivatives:

formula_16

Second-order partial derivatives:

formula_17

Second-order mixed derivatives:

formula_18

Higher-order partial and mixed derivatives:

formula_19

When dealing with functions of multiple variables, some of these variables may be related to each other, thus it may be necessary to specify explicitly which variables are being held constant to avoid ambiguity. In fields such as statistical mechanics, the partial derivative of with respect to , holding and constant, is often expressed as

formula_20

Conventionally, for clarity and simplicity of notation, the partial derivative &quot;function&quot; and the &quot;value&quot; of the function at a specific point are conflated by including the function arguments when the partial derivative symbol (Leibniz notation) is used. Thus, an expression like 

formula_21 

is used for the function, while 

formula_22 

might be used for the value of the function at the point However, this convention breaks down when we want to evaluate the partial derivative at a point like In such a case, evaluation of the function must be expressed in an unwieldy manner as 

formula_23 

or 

formula_24 

in order to use the Leibniz notation. Thus, in these cases, it may be preferable to use the Euler differential operator notation with formula_25 as the partial derivative symbol with respect to the -th variable. For instance, one would write formula_26 for the example described above, while the expression formula_27 represents the partial derivative &quot;function&quot; with respect to the first variable.

For higher order partial derivatives, the partial derivative (function) of formula_28 with respect to the -th variable is denoted That is, so that the variables are listed in the order in which the derivatives are taken, and thus, in reverse order of how the composition of operators is usually notated. Of course, Clairaut&#x27;s theorem implies that formula_29 as long as comparatively mild regularity conditions on are satisfied.

==Gradient==

An important example of a function of several variables is the case of a scalar-valued function formula_30 on a domain in Euclidean space formula_8 (e.g., on formula_32 or In this case has a partial derivative formula_33 with respect to each variable . At the point , these partial derivatives define the vector

formula_34

This vector is called the &quot;gradient&quot; of at . If is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function which takes the point to the vector . Consequently, the gradient produces a vector field.

A common abuse of notation is to define the del operator () as follows in three-dimensional Euclidean space formula_35 with unit vectors , \hat{\mathbf{j}}, \hat{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt;:}}

formula_36

Or, more generally, for -dimensional Euclidean space formula_8 with coordinates formula_38 and unit vectors _1, \ldots, \hat{\mathbf{e}}_n&lt;/math&gt;:}}

formula_39

==Directional derivative==
== Example ==
Suppose that is a function of more than one variable. For instance,

formula_40

The graph of this function defines a surface in Euclidean space. To every point on this surface, there are an infinite number of tangent lines. Partial differentiation is the act of choosing one of these lines and finding its slope. Usually, the lines of most interest are those that are parallel to the -plane, and those that are parallel to the -plane (which result from holding either or constant, respectively).

To find the slope of the line tangent to the function at and parallel to the -plane, we treat as a constant. The graph and this plane are shown on the right. Below, we see how the function looks on the plane . By finding the derivative of the equation while assuming that is a constant, we find that the slope of at the point is:

formula_41

So at , by substitution, the slope is . Therefore,

formula_42

at the point . That is, the partial derivative of with respect to at is , as shown in the graph.

The function can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:

formula_43

In other words, every value of defines a function, denoted , which is a function of one variable . That is,

formula_44

In this section the subscript notation denotes a function contingent on a fixed value of , and not a partial derivative.

Once a value of is chosen, say , then determines a function which traces a curve on the -plane:

formula_45

In this expression, is a , not a , so is a function of only one real variable, that being . Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:

formula_46

The above procedure can be performed for any choice of . Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function which describes the variation of in the direction:

formula_47

This is the partial derivative of with respect to . Here &quot; is a rounded &#x27;d&#x27; called the &quot;partial derivative symbol&quot;; to distinguish it from the letter &#x27;d&#x27;, &quot; is sometimes pronounced &quot;partial&quot;.

==Higher order partial derivatives==

Second and higher order partial derivatives are defined analogously to the higher order derivatives of univariate functions. For the function formula_48 the &quot;own&quot; second partial derivative with respect to is simply the partial derivative of the partial derivative (both with respect to ):

formula_49

The cross partial derivative with respect to and is obtained by taking the partial derivative of with respect to , and then taking the partial derivative of the result with respect to , to obtain

formula_50

Schwarz&#x27;s theorem states that if the second derivatives are continuous, the expression for the cross partial derivative is unaffected by which variable the partial derivative is taken with respect to first and which is taken second. That is,

formula_51

or equivalently formula_52

Own and cross partial derivatives appear in the Hessian matrix which is used in the second order conditions in optimization problems.
The higher order partial derivatives can be obtained by successive differentiation

==Antiderivative analogue==
There is a concept for partial derivatives that is analogous to antiderivatives for regular derivatives. Given a partial derivative, it allows for the partial recovery of the original function.

Consider the example of 

formula_41

The so-called partial integral can be taken with respect to (treating as constant, in a similar manner to partial differentiation):

formula_54

Here, the constant of integration is no longer a constant, but instead a function of all the variables of the original function except . The reason for this is that all the other variables are treated as constant when taking the partial derivative, so any function which does not involve will disappear when taking the partial derivative, and we have to account for this when we take the antiderivative. The most general way to represent this is to have the constant represent an unknown function of all the other variables.

Thus the set of functions where is any one-argument function, represents the entire set of functions in variables that could have produced the -partial derivative 

If all the partial derivatives of a function are known (for example, with the gradient), then the antiderivatives can be matched via the above process to reconstruct the original function up to a constant. Unlike in the single-variable case, however, not every set of functions can be the set of all (first) partial derivatives of a single function. In other words, not every vector field is conservative.

==Applications==

===Geometry===

The volume of a cone depends on the cone&#x27;s height and its radius according to the formula

formula_55

The partial derivative of with respect to is

formula_56

which represents the rate with which a cone&#x27;s volume changes if its radius is varied and its height is kept constant. The partial derivative with respect to equals which represents the rate with which the volume changes if its height is varied and its radius is kept constant.

By contrast, the &quot;total&quot; derivative of with respect to and are respectively

formula_57

The difference between the total and partial derivative is the elimination of indirect dependencies between variables in partial derivatives.

If (for some arbitrary reason) the cone&#x27;s proportions have to stay the same, and the height and radius are in a fixed ratio ,

formula_58

This gives the total derivative with respect to ,

formula_59

which simplifies to

formula_60

Similarly, the total derivative with respect to is

formula_61

The total derivative with respect to and of the volume intended as scalar function of these two variables is given by the gradient vector 

formula_62

===Optimization===

Partial derivatives appear in any calculus-based optimization problem with more than one choice variable. For example, in economics a firm may wish to maximize profit with respect to the choice of the quantities and of two different types of output. The first order conditions for this optimization are . Since both partial derivatives and will generally themselves be functions of both arguments and , these two first order conditions form a system of two equations in two unknowns.

===Thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and mathematical physics===

Partial derivatives appear in thermodynamic equations like Gibbs-Duhem equation, in quantum mechanics as in Schrödinger wave equation, as well as in other equations from mathematical physics. The variables being held constant in partial derivatives here can be ratios of simple variables like mole fractions in the following example involving the Gibbs energies in a ternary mixture system:

formula_63

Express mole fractions of a component as functions of other components&#x27; mole fraction and binary mole ratios:

formula_64

Differential quotients can be formed at constant ratios like those above:

formula_65

Ratios X, Y, Z of mole fractions can be written for ternary and multicomponent systems:

formula_66

which can be used for solving partial differential equations like:

formula_67

This equality can be rearranged to have differential quotient of mole fractions on one side.

===Image resizing===

Partial derivatives are key to target-aware image resizing algorithms. Widely known as seam carving, these algorithms require each pixel in an image to be assigned a numerical &#x27;energy&#x27; to describe their dissimilarity against orthogonal adjacent pixels. The algorithm then progressively removes rows or columns with the lowest energy. The formula established to determine a pixel&#x27;s energy (magnitude of gradient at a pixel) depends heavily on the constructs of partial derivatives.

===Economics===

Partial derivatives play a prominent role in economics, in which most functions describing economic behaviour posit that the behaviour depends on more than one variable. For example, a societal consumption function may describe the amount spent on consumer goods as depending on both income and wealth; the marginal propensity to consume is then the partial derivative of the consumption function with respect to income.

<text>John Anton Goldsmith (born 1951) is the Edward Carson Waller Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago, with appointments in linguistics and computer science.

==Biography==
Goldsmith obtained his B.A. at Swarthmore College in 1972, and completed his PhD in Linguistics at MIT in 1976, under the linguist Morris Halle. He was on the faculty of the Department of Linguistics at Indiana University before joining the University of Chicago in 1984. He has taught at the LSA Linguistic Institutes and has held visiting appointments at many universities, such as McGill, Harvard, and UCSD. In 2007, Goldsmith was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Research==
Goldsmith&#x27;s research ranges from phonology to computational linguistics. His PhD thesis introduced autosegmental phonology; the idea that phonological phenomena is a collection of parallel tiers with individual segments, each representing certain features of speech. His more recent research focuses on unsupervised learning of linguistic structure (as demonstrated by the Linguistica project, a body of software that tries to automatically analyze the morphology of a language), as well as extending computational linguistics algorithms to bioinformatics.

<text>Autosegmental phonology is a framework of phonological analysis proposed by John Goldsmith in his PhD thesis in 1976 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT).

As a theory of phonological representation, autosegmental phonology developed a formal account of ideas that had been sketched in earlier work by several linguists, notably Bernard Bloch (1948), Charles Hockett (1955) and J. R. Firth (1948). According to such a view, phonological representations consist of more than one linear sequence of segments; each linear sequence constitutes a separate tier. The co-registration of elements (or &quot;autosegments&quot;) on one tier with those on another is represented by association lines. There is a close relationship between analysis of segments into distinctive features and an autosegmental analysis; each feature in a language appears on exactly one tier.

The working hypothesis of autosegmental analysis is that a large part of phonological generalizations can be interpreted as a restructuring or reorganization of the autosegments in a representation. Clear examples of the usefulness of autosegmental analysis came in early work from the detailed study of African tone languages, as well as the study of vowel and nasal harmony systems. A few years later, John McCarthy proposed an important development by showing that the derivation of words from consonantal roots in Arabic could be analyzed autosegmentally.

In the first decade of the development of the theory, G. N. Clements developed a number of influential aspects of the theory involving harmonic processes, especially vowel harmony and nasal harmony, and John McCarthy generalized the theory to deal with the conjugational system of classical Arabic, on the basis of an autosegmental account of vowel and consonant slots on a central timing tier (see also nonconcatenative morphology).

== Structure of autosegmental rules ==
The autosegmental formalism departs from the depiction of segments as matrices of features in order to show segments as connected groups of individual features. Segments are depicted through vertical listings of features connected by lines. These sets can also underspecify in order to indicate a class rather than a single segment. Environments can be shown by placing other connected sets of features around that which is the focus of the rule. Feature changes are shown by striking through the lines that connect a feature that is lost to the rest of the segment and drawing dotted lines to features that are gained.

=== Distinctive features ===

Rather than classify segments using the categories given in the International Phonetic Alphabet, the autosegmental formalism makes use of distinctive features, which provide greater granularity and make identification of natural classes easier. A segment is identified by a +/− dichotomy of a series of binary features, some of which are subfeatures of unary features (place of articulation, in particular, is identified by unary features indicating the active articulator, and binary subfeatures that distinguish further). For example, [p], the voiceless bilabial stop, is indicated [−sonorant, −continuant, −voice, labial], and the set of voiced coronal stops can be indicated [−sonorant, −continuant, +voice, coronal].
==== Feature dependencies ====
For unary features to be fully specified, it is necessary to include binary subfeatures that correspond to them. In the autosegmental formalism, this is depicted by placing the binary subfeature at a horizontal offset from the unary feature and connecting them with a line. The next top-level feature in the segment would then be connected to the unary feature as well as opposed to the tone.

=== Functional groupings ===
There are situations in which the rule applies not to a particular value of a feature, but to whatever value the feature has. In these situations, it is necessary to include the presence of the feature, but not to specify its value. This can be done by including a placeholder feature composed of ellipses, with an indication of the type of feature. For example, a generic place feature can be indicated [...]P.

== Tiers ==
The autosegmental formalism deals with several separate linear sequences; because of this, a phonological representation is depicted on several distinct tiers. Each of these tiers shows a different language feature.

=== Segmental tier ===
The autosegmental tier (also &quot;skeletal tier&quot;) contains the features that define the segments articulated in the phonological representation. The descriptions given in the previous section deal with the segmental tier. In the segmental tier, features are assigned to segments.

=== Timing tier ===
The timing tier contains timing units that define the lengths of segments in the phonological representation. These timing units are commonly depicted as X&#x27;s, and are assigned to segments.

=== Stress tier ===
The stress tier contains the features that show the distribution of stress in the phonological representation. The features in the stress tier are [+/– stress] and [+/– main], and they are assigned to the stress-bearing units of the language (syllables or moras).

=== Tone tier ===
The tone tier contains the features that show the distribution of tones in the phonological representation. The features in the tone tier are [+/– high pitch] and [+/– low pitch], and they are assigned to the tone-bearing units of the language (syllables or moras).

== Well-Formedness Condition ==
As a theory of the dynamic of phonological representations, autosegmental phonology includes a Well-formedness Condition on association lines (each element on one tier that &quot;may&quot; be associated to an element on another tier &quot;must&quot; be associated to such an element, and association lines do not cross) plus an instruction as to what to do in case of a violation of the Well-formedness Condition: add or delete the minimum number of association lines in order to maximally satisfy it. Many of the most interesting predictions of the autosegmental model derive from the automatic effects of the Well-formedness Condition and their independence of language-particular rules.

== Examples ==
=== Place assimilation in nasals ===
The autosegmental formalism can be especially useful in describing assimilation rules. Using it for such rules makes the relationship between the result of the rule and the environment obvious. It also makes it possible to concisely describe rules that apply to different environments in different ways.

The phenomenon whereby /ɪn/ goes to [ɪn] in such words as &lt;intractable&gt; and &lt;indestructible&gt;, [ɪŋ] in such words as &lt;ingrate&gt; and &lt;incapacitate&gt;, and [ɪm] in such words as &lt;impossible&gt; and &lt;implausible&gt; can be represented in the autosegmental formalism. The rule is that a coronal nasal will assimilate to the place of the following consonant. The nasal is depicted by [+nasal] connected to a [coronal]P, and the consonant is depicted to the nasal&#x27;s right as [...]P. No more specification is necessary because place is the only feature of the following segment that factors into the rule. The assimilation is shown by striking through the line to [coronal]P on the left and drawing a dotted line to the [...]P on the right.
