<text>Parnall was a British aircraft manufacturer that evolved from a wood-working company before the First World War to a significant designer of military and civil aircraft into the 1940s. It was based in the west of England and was originally known as George Parnall &amp; Co. Ltd.

==History==
In 1916, the Bristol based Parnall &amp; Sons shopfitters started to manufacture aircraft at the Colliseum Works at Park Row in Bristol. During the First World War, the skilled staff were moved to sites around the city and in neighbouring South Gloucestershire producing planes to their own designs and, under contract, those of other companies.

In 1919, the aircraft business was split from the parent company Parnall &amp; Sons as George Parnall and Company. In the 1920s, aircraft manufacture was centralised at a factory in Yate close to an airfield used by the Royal Flying Corps. In the 1930s, gun turrets for bomber aircraft were produced. The site was a strategic target for Luftwaffe bombing and during 1941, over fifty people were killed during the raids.

In 1935, Parnall Aircraft Limited was formed when George Parnall and Company amalgamated with the Hendy Aircraft Company and Nash and Thompson Limited. After the Second World War as aircraft component manufacture reduced, domestic appliances were built at the site. To reflect this move away from aviation the company changed its name to Parnall (Yate) Limited in 1946. This was acquired by Radiation Ltd. in 1958 and TI Group in 1967.

==Aircraft==
The Parnall Scout was a prototype single-seat anti-airship wooden biplane fighter aircraft developed in the 1910s. It was too heavy and slow and never went into production.

The Parnall Panther was a carrier-based wooden, single-bay biplane spotter and reconnaissance aircraft designed by Harold Bolas, who had joined Parnall and Sons after leaving the Admiralty&#x27;s Air Department. It had a 230 hp Bentley BR2 rotary engine. Following contractual disputes production was transferred to the Bristol Aeroplane Company.

The Parnall Puffin was an experimental amphibious fighter-reconnaissance biplane.

The Parnall Plover single-seat naval fighter aircraft of the 1920s for use off the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers, was ordered into small-scale production, but after extensive evaluation, the Fairey Flycatcher was preferred for large-scale service.

The Parnall Possum was an experimental triplane, with a single, central engine driving wing-mounted propellers via shafts and gears. Two of these aircraft were built in the mid-1920s.

The Parnall Pixie was a low-powered single-seat monoplane light aircraft originally designed to compete in the Lympne trials for motor-gliders in 1923, where it was flown successfully by Norman Macmillan. It had two sets of wings, one for cross-country flights and the other for speed; it later appeared as a biplane which could be converted into a monoplane. Parnall Pixie IIIa G-EBJG is still in existence with the Midland Air Museum, Coventry, England. The remains are in deep store and are not generally on view to the public without prior arrangement.

The Parnall Perch was a single-engined, side-by-side-seat aircraft designed as a general-purpose trainer. No contract on this specification was awarded and only one Perch was built.
The Parnall Peto was a small seaplane with folding wings for use as a submarine-carried reconnaissance aircraft.

The Parnall Pike was a two/three-seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft, capable of operating off carrier decks or from water, built in 1927. Only one was constructed.

The Parnall Pipit was a single-engine, single-seat naval fighter designed to an Air Ministry specification in 1927. Two prototypes were built but both were destroyed by tail flutter.

The Parnall Imp was an unusual single-engine, two-seat biplane built in 1927. It had a straight cantilever lower wing which supported the markedly swept upper wing. Only one was built.

The Parnall Elf was a two-seat light touring biplane, three being built at Yate between 1928 and 1932. The Elf was the last aircraft designed by Harold Bolas before he left the company to go to the United States.

The Parnall Prawn was an experimental flying boat built in 1930. Its single engine was fitted on a tilting mounting in the nose, so that the propeller could be kept clear of the water on takeoff and landing. Only one was built and it is not known whether it was ever flown.

The Parnall Parasol was an experimental parasol winged aircraft design to measure the aerodynamic forces on wings in flight. Two were built and flown in the early 1930s.

The Parnall G.4/31 was a 1930s general purpose aircraft which could operate as a day and night bomber as well as the reconnaissance, torpedo and dive-bombing roles. It was a large angular biplane powered by a 690 hp (515 kW) Bristol Pegasus IM3 with a Townend ring.

The Parnall Heck was designed by Basil B. Henderson as a single-engined, conventional low-wing cabin monoplane, built of spruce with a plywood covering, initially a two-seater in tandem layout. The prototype was originally flown as the &quot;Hendy Heck&quot; but by the time of its first public demonstration in July 1935, the companies had merged and the aircraft was renamed as the &quot;Parnall Heck&quot;.

The Parnall 382 (also known as the Heck III), was a single-engined wooden monoplane trainer aircraft with two open cockpits. It first flew in 1939.

<text>Obi-Wan &quot;Ben&quot; Kenobi () is a character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. In the original film trilogy, he is a Jedi Master who trains Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force. In the prequel trilogy, he mentors Luke&#x27;s father, Anakin Skywalker. Obi-Wan is portrayed by Alec Guinness in the original trilogy and by Ewan McGregor in the prequel films. McGregor also plays the character in the television series &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;. Guinness&#x27;s performance in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) earned him the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor, as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

==Creation and development==
Various claims have been made about the origins of the character Obi-Wan Kenobi. In his book about the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, Chris Taylor asserted that Obi-Wan was inspired by the J.R.R. Tolkien character Gandalf. Ben Sherlock of &quot;ScreenRant&quot;, meanwhile, claimed that the Jedi Master was based on General Makabe Rokurōta, a character from Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;.

Lucas created Obi-Wan Kenobi as a mentor for Luke, and originally planned for him to continue training Luke in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), the first sequel to &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Although Obi-Wan&#x27;s death was not in the final version of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; script, Lucas decided during filming that Obi-Wan should die. Alec Guinness said he begged Lucas to kill off his character because he hated Obi-Wan&#x27;s dialogue. Lucas, however, claimed he added Obi-Wan&#x27;s death because the character served no purpose after his duel with Vader. Lucas later reflected: &quot;It would be much more powerful, satisfying and interesting if Darth Vader were to kill him and he were to go on to a different form.&quot;

When outlining &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Lucas decided he wanted Obi-Wan to return as a spirit to continue training Luke. Partly due to Guinness&#x27;s failing health, Lucas realized that he would also need another mentor character. This new mentor would eventually take the form of Yoda.

Lucas described Obi-Wan&#x27;s character development in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;: &quot;In the beginning, Obi-Wan is at odds with , who rebels against the Jedi rules. But by the end of the film, he has &quot;become&quot; by taking on his rebellious personality and his responsibilities.&quot;

== Portrayal ==
When casting &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Lucas sought an established star for the role of Obi-Wan. He considered Peter Cushing for the part, but decided the actor&#x27;s lean features would be better employed as the villainous Grand Moff Tarkin. The film&#x27;s producer, Gary Kurtz, felt a strong character actor was required to convey the &quot;stability and gravitas&quot; of Obi-Wan. Before Guinness was cast, the Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune—who plays Makabe Rokurōta in &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;—was considered for the role. Mifune&#x27;s daughter, Mika Kitagawa, said her father &quot;had a lot of samurai pride&quot; and turned down the roles of both Obi-Wan and Darth Vader because he thought &quot;Star Wars&quot; would employ cheap special effects and would therefore &quot;cheapen the image of samurai&quot;. Once Guinness was selected and production was underway, Lucas credited the English actor with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder, which contributed significantly to the completion of filming. Harrison Ford, who plays Han Solo in the film, said he admired Guinness&#x27;s preparation, professionalism and kindness towards the other actors.

Ewan McGregor portrays Obi-Wan in the prequel trilogy and in the 2022 miniseries &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi.&quot; His performance in the first prequel film, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), earned him a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actor.

==== Original trilogy ====

Obi-Wan is introduced in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) as an elderly hermit living on Tatooine. When Luke and C-3PO travel the desert in search of the runaway droid R2-D2, Obi-Wan rescues them from Tusken Raiders. At Obi-Wan&#x27;s home, R2-D2 plays a recording of Princess Leia explaining that R2-D2 contains architectural plans for the Galactic Empire&#x27;s battle station, the Death Star. Leia asks Obi-Wan to deliver R2-D2 and the plans to Alderaan to aid the Rebel Alliance. Obi-Wan reveals to Luke that he is a Jedi, a peacekeeper from the days of the Republic. He explains that Luke&#x27;s father was also a Jedi, and was killed by Darth Vader. Obi-Wan gives Luke his father&#x27;s lightsaber and invites him to come to Alderaan and begin Jedi training. At first Luke declines, but changes his mind after finding that his aunt and uncle have been killed by Imperial stormtroopers.

As Obi-Wan and Luke approach Mos Eisley, Obi-Wan uses a Jedi mind trick to compel Imperial troops to let them through a checkpoint. Obi-Wan and Luke hire the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca to take them to Alderaan aboard Han&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. During the journey, Obi-Wan instructs Luke in lightsaber combat. Obi-Wan suddenly feels &quot;a great disturbance in the Force&quot;; soon after, he and the others find that the Empire has obliterated Alderaan. The &quot;Falcon&quot; gets caught in the Death Star&#x27;s tractor beam, but the group is able to avoid detection and infiltrate the station. Obi-Wan disables the tractor beam, then encounters Vader. They engage in a lightsaber duel as Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca escape. Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down, then vanishes into the Force. Later, Obi-Wan contacts Luke through the Force and helps him destroy the Death Star.

In &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), Obi-Wan appears several times as a Force spirit. On the ice planet Hoth, he instructs Luke to travel to Dagobah to find the exiled Jedi Master Yoda. Yoda is reluctant to mentor Luke, but Obi-Wan convinces him to continue Luke&#x27;s training. When Luke intends to leave Dagobah to rescue his friends in Cloud City, Obi-Wan beseeches him to stay, but Luke leaves anyway. 

In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), Obi-Wan appears to Luke after Yoda&#x27;s death on Dagobah. Obi-Wan confirms that Vader is Luke&#x27;s father, and reveals that Leia is Luke&#x27;s twin sister. He urges Luke to confront and defeat Vader. After the Rebels destroy the second Death Star and defeat the Empire, Obi-Wan appears at the celebration on Endor alongside the Force spirits of Yoda and Anakin Skywalker.

==== Prequel trilogy ====

A younger Obi-Wan appears in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), which is set thirty-two years before &quot;Star Wars&quot;. He is the apprentice of the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, and accompanies him to negotiations with the Trade Federation, which is blockading the planet Naboo. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon rescue Naboo&#x27;s fourteen-year-old queen Padmé Amidala with help from the Gungan Jar Jar Binks, then travel to Coruscant, the capital of the Republic. When they land on Tatooine for repairs, they encounter the nine-year-old slave Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon believes the boy is the &quot;Chosen One&quot; of Jedi prophecy, destined to bring balance to the Force. After securing his freedom, Anakin joins the group on their journey. While leaving Tatooine, they are attacked by the Sith Lord Darth Maul. Back on Naboo, they meet Maul again, and engage him in lightsaber combat. Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon, then is killed by Obi-Wan. As Qui-Gon dies, he asks his apprentice to train Anakin as a Jedi, with or without the approval of the Jedi Council. Later, Yoda proclaims Obi-Wan a Jedi Knight and reluctantly allows Anakin to become his Padawan.

The second film of the trilogy, &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), takes place ten years later. Anakin has grown powerful but arrogant, and believes that Obi-Wan is holding him back. After they save Padmé from an assassination attempt, Obi-Wan traces the assassins to the planet Kamino. He learns of a massive clone army that is being created for the Republic. The clones are derived from the bounty hunter Jango Fett, and Obi-Wan deduces that he was responsible for the attempt on Padmé&#x27;s life. Fett escapes to the planet Geonosis with his clone son Boba, unaware that Obi-Wan is pursuing them. On Geonosis, Obi-Wan discovers that a confederacy of star systems is planning to revolt against the Republic. The confederacy is led by the Sith Lord Count Dooku, the former Jedi Master of . Obi-Wan is captured and sentenced to death by Dooku, but Yoda and Mace Windu arrive with an army and prevent the execution. Obi-Wan and Anakin confront Dooku, but he overpowers them both. Yoda saves their lives, but Dooku escapes.

&quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005) is set three years later. Obi-Wan is now a Jedi Master, a member of the Jedi Council, and a general. Obi-Wan and Anakin embark on a rescue mission to save the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine from the cyborg Separatist commander General Grievous. Dooku duels the Jedi once again, knocking Obi-Wan unconscious. Anakin then defeats Dooku and executes him on Palpatine&#x27;s orders. After locating Grievous on the planet Utapau, Obi-Wan kills him. The Sith Lord Darth Sidious— who is revealed to be Palpatine—issues Order 66, which compels the clone troopers to betray and kill the Jedi. Obi-Wan and Yoda find that all the Jedi in the Jedi Temple have been slaughtered, including the children. After Obi-Wan warns all surviving Jedi to go into exile, he discovers it was Anakin, now Sidious&#x27; apprentice Darth Vader, who led the massacre.

Obi-Wan visits Padmé to ascertain Anakin&#x27;s whereabouts, and realizes that Anakin is her husband and the father of her unborn child. When Padmé travels to the volcanic planet Mustafar to confront her husband herself, Obi-Wan stows away aboard her ship. Once on Mustafar, Obi-Wan confronts Vader, who accuses him and Padmé of conspiring against him. After Vader uses the Force to strangle Padmé into unconsciousness, Obi-Wan engages him in a ferocious lightsaber duel, which ends with severing several of his limbs. Obi-Wan leaves Vader burning to death, unaware that he will be rescued by Sidious moments later and eventually turned into a cyborg. Obi-Wan takes Padmé to the asteroid Polis Massa, where she dies after giving birth to the twins Luke and Leia. He assists in hiding the children from the newly created Empire: Leia is adopted by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan, while Obi-Wan delivers Luke to Anakin&#x27;s stepbrother Owen Lars and his wife Beru on Tatooine. Obi-Wan then goes into exile on Tatooine, where he can watch over Luke.

==== Sequel trilogy ====

In &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), Rey hears Obi-Wan&#x27;s voice during a Force vision. During her battle against the resurrected Darth Sidious in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), she hears the voices of various deceased Jedi, including Obi-Wan. He says, &quot;These are your final steps, Rey. Rise and take them.&quot; The voices of both McGregor and Guinness were used in both films.

<doc id="56197" wikidata="Q23719201" url="?curid=56197" title="Warp Drive">
<text>Warp Drive is a short street in Sterling, Virginia, United States. Originally named Steeplechase Drive, it is located in an industrial park off Atlantic Boulevard, and primarily serves as the address for Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, an aerospace company. The street ends at a circle where an off-ramp from Virginia State Highway 28 joins from the opposite direction.

In 2011, employees of Orbital Sciences—later acquired by Northrop—asked the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors to rename their street after the warp drive that allows ships in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe to travel faster than light. The supervisors voted unanimously to make it so (several of them using catchphrases associated with the franchise).

==Street==

Warp Drive&#x27;s eastern terminus is a signalized three-way intersection with Atlantic Boulevard, roughly one half-mile (800 m) north of its southern terminus at Church Road (Virginia State Route 625) at Sterling. The area is developed in a pattern typical of eastern Loudoun County&#x27;s edge-city suburban sprawl. On either side of Atlantic at the intersection are office buildings surrounded by parking lots, all facilities of Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, with some newer residential subdivisions to the southeast and, across the Cabin Branch of Broad Run, the east. The Washington &amp; Old Dominion Trail runs to the immediate southwest.

To the northeast is another office building with an artificial pond. The northwest corner of the intersection, and the entire north side of Warp Drive, is a large undeveloped parcel. From the intersection, the street runs 300 ft (100 m) west, divided by a grass median strip, to a small traffic circle that gives access to driveways into Orbital&#x27;s facilities on the north and south. On the west side is the end of a one-way offramp that gives access to Warp from Sully Road (Virginia State Route 28), roughly to the west.

==History==

Orbital Sciences Corporation was founded in 1982 to provide rocket engines and parts to aerospace and defense customers public and private. It has always been headquartered in Northern Virginia, like many other defense contractors. In 1993 it moved into its current complex in Sterling.

At that time the short street where Orbital was located was known as Steeplechase Drive. In 2011 the company&#x27;s executives, who were fans of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, asked the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors to formally rename the street Warp Drive, after the faster-than-light &quot;warp drive&quot; propulsion technology used by the franchise&#x27;s starships. At the last meeting of the year, the board voted unanimously to grant the request.

Officially, the county said the change was made to &quot;improve the identity and to better integrate the Orbital campus.&quot; But supervisors were less formal when discussing the issue, which had originally been on a consent agenda. Several cast their votes with catchphrases from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. &quot;To Orbital, live long and prosper,&quot; said Stevens Miller, who lived in Sterling. Board member Eugene Delgaudio asked, &quot;Can you give me any speed, Scotty?&quot;, incorrectly using a Scottish accent as he did so.

One supervisor, Jim Burton of the Blue Ridge District, tried to be serious. He reminded the board that &quot;warp&quot; had other meanings. &quot;You need to think about it before you vote on it&quot; he warned. &quot;Would you prefer &#x27;Beam me up, Scotty?&#x27;&quot;, the board&#x27;s chairman replied. In the end the vote was unanimous. &quot;What more uplifting motion could there possibly be than something that will literally make law out of a Star Trek joke?&quot; concluded Miller. &quot;It&#x27;s a great idea. I look forward to driving on Warp Drive myself.&quot; Orbital agreed to reimburse the county for the approximately $500 it would cost to replace the street sign.

The online &quot;Ashburn Patch&quot; noted how the name change reflected the changes to Loudoun County in the past two decades. While the western portion of the county has stayed largely rural and agricultural, as evoked by the street&#x27;s original name of Steeplechase Drive, eastern Loudoun has grown tremendously during that same time as many businesses, in particular high-tech defense contractors like Orbital, have located in the area. &quot;So Orbital&#x27;s request to change the name of the road along its perimeter from Steeplechase Drive to Warp Drive brings to mind the county&#x27;s dichotomy,&quot; it observed. &quot;Out with the horse-racing theme and in with space.&quot;

On September 18, 2017, Northrop Grumman announced plans to purchase Orbital for $7.8 billion in cash plus assumption of $1.4 billion in debt. Orbital shareholders approved the buyout on November 29, 2017. The FTC approved the acquisition with conditions on June 5, 2018, and one day later, Orbital was absorbed and became Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems.

<text>A crop circle, crop formation, or corn circle is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was first coined in the early 1980s. Crop circles have been described as all falling &quot;within the range of the sort of thing done in hoaxes&quot; by Taner Edis, professor of physics at Truman State University. 

Although obscure natural causes or alien origins of crop circles are suggested by fringe theorists, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation. In 1991, two hoaxers, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, took credit for having created over 200 crop circles throughout England, in widely-reported interviews. The number of reports of crop circles increased substantially after interviews with them. In the United Kingdom, reported circles are not distributed randomly across the landscape, but appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population, and cultural heritage monuments, such as Stonehenge or Avebury. They usually appear overnight. Nearly half of all crop circles found in the UK in 2003 were located within a radius of the Avebury stone circles.

In contrast to crop circles or crop formations, archaeological remains can cause cropmarks in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but these do not appear overnight, and are always in the same places every year. 

== History ==

=== Before the 20th century ===

A 1678 news pamphlet &quot;The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire&quot; describes a crop whose stalks were cut rather than bent. (see folklore section).

In 1686, an English naturalist, Robert Plot, reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms (see fairy rings) in &quot;The Natural History of Stafford-Shire&quot;, proposing air flows from the sky as a cause. In 1991, meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles, a claim that has been compared with those made by Erich von Däniken.

An 1880 letter to the editor of &quot;Nature&quot; by amateur scientist John Rand Capron describes how several circles of flattened crops in a field were formed under suspicious circumstances and possibly caused by &quot;cyclonic wind action&quot;, stating &quot;as viewed from a distance, circular spots (...) they all presented much the same character, viz, a few standing stalks as a centre, some prostrate stalks with their heads arranged pretty evenly in a direction forming a circle round the centre, and outside there a circular wall of stalks which had not suffered&quot;.

=== 20th century ===
In 1932, archaeologist E. C. Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester, but could examine only one: &quot;a circle in which the barley was &#x27;lodged&#x27; or beaten down, while the interior area was very slightly mounded up.&quot;

In &quot;Fortean Times,&quot; David Wood reported that in 1940 he made crop circles near Gloucestershire using ropes. 

In 1963, Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire that he considered was probably caused by an unknown meteoric body. In nearby wheat fields, there were several circular and elliptical areas where the wheat had been flattened. There was evidence of &quot;spiral flattening&quot;. He thought they could be caused by air currents from the impact, since they led towards the crater. Astronomer Hugh Ernest Butler observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes.

During the 1960s, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugarcane fields in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada. For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada; Department of National Defence investigators concluded that it was artificial but couldn&#x27;t say who made them or how. The most famous case is the 1966 Tully &quot;saucer nest&quot;, when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise from a swamp and then fly away. On investigating he found a nearly circular area long by wide where the grass was flattened in clockwise curves to water level within the circle, and the reeds had been uprooted from the mud. The local police officer, the Royal Australian Air Force, and the University of Queensland concluded that it was most probably caused by natural causes, like a down draught, a willy-willy (dust devil), or a waterspout. In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the &quot;saucer&quot; was probably debris lifted by a willy-willy.

After the 1960s, there was a surge of UFOlogists in Wiltshire, and there were rumours of &quot;saucer nests&quot; appearing in the area, but they were never photographed. There are other pre-1970s reports of circular formations, especially in Australia and Canada, but they were always simple circles, which could have been caused by whirlwinds. 

British pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley reported they started creating crop circles in British cornfields in 1978, inspired by the Tully &quot;saucer nest&quot; case.

The first film to depict a geometric crop circle, in this case created by super-intelligent ants, was the 1974 science-fiction film &quot;Phase IV&quot;. The film has been cited as a possible inspiration or influence on the pranksters who started this phenomenon.

The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared and spread since the late 1970s as many circles began appearing throughout the English countryside. This phenomenon became widely known in the late 1980s, after the media started to report crop circles in Hampshire and Wiltshire. After Bower and Chorley gave interviews in 1991 about how they had made crop circles, circles started appearing all over the world. By 2001, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally, from locations such as the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, the U.S., and Canada. Researchers have noted a correlation between crop circles, recent media coverage, and the absence of fencing and/or anti-trespassing legislation.

Although farmers expressed concern at the damage caused to their crops, local response to the appearance of crop circles was often enthusiastic, with locals taking advantage of the increase of tourism and visits from scientists, crop circle researchers, and individuals seeking spiritual experiences. The market for crop circle interest consequently generated bus or helicopter tours of circle sites, walking tours, T-shirts, and book sales.

=== 21st century ===
Since the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring as many as 2,000 different shapes and some incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics.

The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as Stonehenge or Avebury. He found that they always appeared in areas that were easy to access. This suggests strongly that these crop circles were more likely to be caused by intentional human action than by paranormal activity. Another strong indication of that theory was that inhabitants of the zone with the most circles had a historical tendency for making large-scale formations, including stone circles such as Stonehenge, earthen mounds such as Silbury Hill, long barrows such as West Kennet Long Barrow, and white horses in chalk hills.

== Bower and Chorley ==
In 1991, two self-professed pranksters, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, made headlines by saying they had started the crop circle phenomenon in 1978, using simple tools consisting of a plank of wood, rope, and a baseball cap fitted with a loop of wire to help them walk in straight lines. To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a &quot;cereologist&quot; (advocate of paranormal explanations of crop circles), Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax. 

Inspired by Australian crop circle accounts from 1966, Bower and Chorley claimed to be responsible for all circles made prior to 1987, and for more than 200 crop circles in 1978–1991 (with 1,000 other circles not being made by them). Writing in &quot;Physics World&quot;, Richard Taylor of the University of Oregon said that &quot;the pictographs they created inspired a second wave of crop artists. Far from fizzling out, crop circles have evolved into an international phenomenon, with hundreds of sophisticated pictographs now appearing annually around the globe.&quot;

== Art and business ==

After reports of simple circles in the 1970s, increasingly complex geometric designs have been created by anonymous artists, in some cases to attract tourists to an area.

Since the early 1990s, the UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg, and subsequently including Wil Russell and Rob Irving, has been creating crop circles in the UK and around the world as part of its art practice and also for commercial clients.

The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set that was released on 7 September 1990, along with the remasters of the first boxed set, as well as the second boxed set, all feature an image of a crop circle that appeared in East Field in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire.

On the night of 11–12 July 1992, a crop-circle-making competition with a prize of £3,000 (funded in part by the Arthur Koestler Foundation) was held in Berkshire. The winning entry was produced by three Westland Helicopters engineers, using rope, PVC pipe, a plank, string, a telescopic device and two stepladders. According to Rupert Sheldrake, the competition was organised by him and John Michell and &quot;co-sponsored by The Guardian and The Cerealogist&quot;. The prize money came from &quot;PM&quot;, a German magazine. Sheldrake wrote that &quot;The experiment was conclusive. Humans could indeed make all the features of state-of-the-art crop formations at that time. Eleven of the twelve teams made more or less impressive formations that followed the set design.&quot;

In 2002, Discovery Channel commissioned five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from MIT to create crop circles of their own, aiming to duplicate some of the features claimed to distinguish &quot;real&quot; crop circles from the known fakes such as those created by Bower and Chorley. The creation of the circle was recorded and used in the Discovery Channel documentary &quot;Crop Circles: Mysteries in the Fields&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, in part because makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies that paid well for their efforts.

A video sequence used in connection with the opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London showed two crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. Another Olympic crop circle was visible to passengers landing at nearby Heathrow Airport before and during the Games.

A crop circle depicting the emblem of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Rebel Alliance was created in California in December 2017 by a father and his 11-year-old son as a spaceport for X-wing fighters.

== Legal implications ==
In 1992, Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos, both then aged 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle. Takács and Dallos, of the St. Stephen Agricultural Technicum, a high school in Hungary specializing in agriculture, created a diameter crop circle in a wheat field near Székesfehérvár, southwest of Budapest, on 8 June 1992. In September, the pair appeared on Hungarian TV and exposed the circle as a hoax, showing photos of the field before and after the circle was made. As a result, Aranykalász Co., the owners of the land, sued the teens for 630,000 Ft (~$3,000 USD) in damages. The presiding judge ruled that the students were only responsible for the damage caused in the circle itself, amounting to about 6,000 Ft (~$30 USD), and that 99% of the damage to the crops was caused by the thousands of visitors who flocked to Székesfehérvár following the media&#x27;s promotion of the circle. The fine was eventually paid by the TV show, as were the students&#x27; legal fees.

In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first man in the UK to be arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle near Devizes. In November 2000, he was fined £100 plus £40 in costs. , no one else has been successfully prosecuted in the UK for criminal damage caused by creating crop circles.

== Creation ==
=== Human origin ===
The scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, advertising, or art. The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. It is also possible to bend grass without breaking it, if it has recently rained—a method that was used to create crop circles in Hungary in 1992. Skeptics of the paranormal point out that all characteristics of crop circles are fully compatible with their being made by hoaxers.

Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England. When some people refused to believe them, they deliberately added straight lines and squares to show that they could not have natural causes. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Physicists have suggested that the most complex formations might be made with the help of GPS and lasers. In 2009, a circle formation was made over the course of three consecutive nights and was apparently left unfinished, with some half-made circles.

The main criticism of alleged non-human creation of crop circles is that while evidence of these origins, besides eyewitness testimonies, is absent, many are definitely known to be the work of human pranksters, and others can be adequately explained as such. There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be &quot;the real thing&quot;, only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud, like Bower and Chorley and tabloid &quot;Today&quot; hoaxing Pat Delgado, the Wessex Sceptics and Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Equinox&quot; hoaxing Terence Meaden, or a friend of a Canadian farmer hoaxing a field researcher of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network. In his 1995 book &quot;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot;, Carl Sagan concludes that crop circles were created by Bower and Chorley and their copycats, and speculates that UFOlogists willingly ignore the evidence for hoaxing so they can keep believing in an extraterrestrial origin of the circles. Many others have demonstrated how complex crop circles can be created. &quot;Scientific American&quot; published an article by Matt Ridley, who started making crop circles in northern England in 1991. He wrote about how easy it is to develop techniques using simple tools that can easily fool later observers. He reported on &quot;expert&quot; sources such as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; who had been easily fooled, and mused about why people want to believe supernatural explanations for phenomena that are not yet explained. Methods of creating a crop circle are now well documented on the Internet.

Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising. Many crop circles show human symbols, like the heart and arrow symbol of love, and stereotyped alien faces.

Hoaxers have been caught in the process of making new circles, such as in 2004 in the Netherlands.

=== Natural origins ===

==== Weather ====
It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak tornadoes to ball lightning, but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes.

In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal &quot;Nature&quot; about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm, saying their shape was &quot;suggestive of some cyclonic wind action&quot;.

In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills. As circles became more complex, Terence had to create increasingly complex theories, blaming an electromagneto-hydrodynamic &quot;plasma vortex&quot;. The meteorological theory became popular, and it was even referenced in 1991 by physicist Stephen Hawking who said that, &quot;Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air&quot;. The weather theory suffered a serious blow in 1991, but Hawking&#x27;s point about hoaxes was supported when Bower and Chorley stated that they had been responsible for making all those circles. By the end of 1991 Meaden conceded that those circles that had complex designs were made by hoaxers.

==== Animal activity ====
In 2009, the attorney general for the island state of Tasmania stated that Australian wallabies had been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies, which are grown legally for medicinal use, after consuming some of the opiate-laden poppies and running in circles.

=== Alternative explanations ===
In science magazines from the 1980s and 1990s, for example &quot;Science Illustrated&quot;, one could read reports suggesting that the plants were bent by something that could be microwave radiation, rather than broken by physical impact. The magazines also contained serious reports of the absence of human influence and measurement of unusual radiation. Today, this is considered to be pseudoscience, while at the time it was subject of serious research. At that time, it was also more likely that an unknown factor was behind the incidents, not least seen in light of the fact that GPS was not available to the public.

==== Paranormal ====
Since becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have been the subject of speculation by various paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic investigators, ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to ley lines.

Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lightning and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity. Some proposed entities are: Gaia asking to stop global warming and human pollution; God; supernatural beings (for example Indian devas); the collective minds of humanity through a proposed &quot;quantum field&quot;; and extraterrestrial beings.

Responding to local beliefs that &quot;extraterrestrial beings&quot; in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as &quot;man-made&quot;. , research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated, &quot;We have come to agree that this &#x27;thing&#x27; cannot be scientifically proven.&quot; Among others, paranormal enthusiasts, ufologists, and anomalistic investigators have offered hypothetical explanations that have been criticised as pseudoscientific by sceptical groups and scientists, including the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. No credible evidence of extraterrestrial origin has been presented.

==== Changes to crops ====
A small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late biophysicist William Levengood) have claimed to observe differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man made. Levengood published papers in journal &quot;Physiologia Plantarum&quot; in 1994 and 1999. In his 1994 paper he found that certain deformities in the grain inside the circles were correlated to the position of the grain inside the circle. 

In 1996, Joe Nickell objected that correlation is not causation, raising several objections to Levengood&#x27;s methods and assumptions, and said, &quot;Until his work is independently replicated by qualified scientists doing &#x27;double-blind&#x27; studies and otherwise following stringent scientific protocols, there seems no need to take seriously the many dubious claims that Levengood makes, including his similar ones involving plants at alleged &#x27;cattle mutilation&#x27; sites.&quot; Nickell also criticised Levengood for using circular logic, stating: &quot;There is, in fact, no satisfactory evidence that a single “genuine” (i.e., vortex-produced) crop-circle exists, so Levengood’s reasoning is circular: Although there are no guaranteed genuine formations on which to conduct research, the research supposedly proves the genuineness of the formations.&quot;

Advocates of non-human causes discount on-site evidence of human involvement as attempts to discredit the phenomena. When Ridley wrote negative articles in newspapers, he was accused of spreading &quot;government disinformation&quot; and of working for the UK military intelligence service MI5. Ridley responded by noting that many &quot;cereologists&quot; make good livings from selling books and providing high-priced personal tours through crop fields, and he claimed that they have vested interests in rejecting what is by far the most likely explanation for the circles.

Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in snow, by using skis, snow shoes or just walking with ordinary shoes.

Patterns similar to crop circles can also be made in sand.

Images can be made in forests by cutting trees, especially in areas with snow. Celebrating the Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway in 1994, a tall stylised image of an Olympic torch runner was made in a forest close to one of the arenas.

== Folklore ==

Researchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old folkloric tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced. Crop circles are culture dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularised Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they do not appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries.

Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of &quot;fairie rings&quot;. Tales also mention balls of light many times but never in relation to crop circles.

A 17th-century English woodcut called the &quot;Mowing-Devil&quot; depicts the devil with a scythe mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. The pamphlet containing the image states that the farmer, disgusted at the wage demanded by his mower for his work, insisted that he would rather have &quot;the devil himself&quot; perform the task. Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider this to be a historical precedent for crop circles because the stalks were cut down, not bent. The circular form indicated to the farmer that it had been caused by the devil.

In the 1948 German story &quot;Die zwölf Schwäne&quot; (&quot;The Twelve Swans&quot;), a farmer every morning finds a circular ring of flattened grain in his field. After several attempts, his son sees twelve princesses disguised as swans, who take off their disguises and dance in the field. Crop rings produced by fungi may have inspired such tales, since folklore considers that these rings are created by dancing wolves or fairies.

<text>The VT100 is a video terminal, introduced in August 1978 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It was one of the first terminals to support ANSI escape codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes for special features like controlling the status lights on the keyboard. This led to rapid uptake of the ANSI standard, which became the de facto standard for hardware video terminals and later terminal emulators.

The VT100 series, especially the VT102, was extremely successful in the market, and made DEC the leading terminal vendor at the time. The VT100 series was replaced by the VT200 series starting in 1983, which proved equally successful. Ultimately, over six million terminals in the VT series were sold, based largely on the success of the VT100.

==Description==
DEC&#x27;s first video terminal was the VT05 (1970), succeeded by the VT50 (1974), and soon upgraded to the VT52 (1975). The VT52 featured a text display with 80 columns and 24 rows, bidirectional scrolling, and a custom control protocol that allowed the cursor to be moved about the screen. These &quot;smart terminals&quot; were a hit due both to their capabilities and to their ability to be run over inexpensive serial links, rather than custom proprietary connections as in the case of systems like the IBM 3270, which generally required expensive controllers for distributed applications. In contrast, &quot;dumb terminals&quot; or &quot;glass teletypes&quot; like the ADM-3 (1975) lacked advanced features such as full cursor addressability, and competed mostly on lowest possible hardware cost.

The VT100 was introduced in August 1978, replacing the VT50/VT52 family. Like the earlier models, it communicated with its host system over serial lines at a minimum speed of 50 bit/s, but increased the maximum speed to 19,200 bit/s, double that of the VT52.
The terminal provided an option for &quot;smooth scrolling&quot;, whereby displayed lines of text were moved gradually up or down the screen to make room for new lines, instead of advancing in sudden &quot;jumps&quot;. This made it easier to scan or read the text, although it somewhat slowed down the maximum data rate.

The major internal change was the control protocol. Unlike the VT50/52&#x27;s proprietary cursor control language, the VT100 was based on the newly emerging ANSI X3.64 standard for command codes. At the time, some computer vendors had suggested that the new standard was beyond the state of the art and could not be implemented at a reasonable price. The introduction of low-cost microprocessors and the ever-falling cost of computer memory offered greatly expanded capabilities, and the VT100 used the new Intel 8080 as its internal processor. In addition, the VT100 provided backwards compatibility for VT52-compatible software, by also supporting the older control sequences.
Other improvements beyond the VT52 included a 132-column mode, and a variety of &quot;graphic renditions&quot; including blinking, bolding, reverse video, underlining, and lines of double-sized or double-width characters. The VT100 also introduced an additional box-drawing character set containing various pseudographics that allowed the drawing of on-screen forms.

All configuration setup of the VT100 was accomplished using interactive displays presented on the screen; the setup data was stored in non-volatile memory within the terminal. Maintainability was also significantly improved, since a VT100 could be quickly dismantled into replaceable modules.

The VT100&#x27;s internal layout can be split into two boards for functionality, not including the VT100&#x27;s optional boards you can purchase. There is a board called the video monitor board which is used for things like adjusting the CRT on the terminal itself. This board is responsible for adjusting the CRT in the case that the electron beam is offset. The terminal controller board is what handles the terminal logic, and includes a multitude of chips such as DEC&#x27;s rebranding of the Intel 8080. 

In 1983, the VT100 was replaced by the more powerful VT200 series terminals such as the VT220.

==Options==
The VT100 has various third party and first party boards designed to enhance the capabilities of the device. Most notable of these from DEC themselves are the VT1XX-AB (Advanced Video Option) and the VT1XX-AA (20 mA Current Loop Option). The cards&#x27; capabilities and existence are described in Chapter 4 of the VT100 User Guide.

==Variants==

The VT100 was the first of Digital&#x27;s terminals to be based on an industry-standard microprocessor, the Intel 8080. Options could be added to the terminal to support an external printer, additional graphic renditions, and more character memory. The last option, known as the &quot;Advanced Video Option&quot; or AVO, allowed the terminal to support a full 24 lines of text in 132-column mode, increasing from the 14 lines of the unexpanded model when used in 132-column mode. The VT100 became a platform on which Digital constructed several related hardware products.

The VT101 and VT102 were cost-reduced, non-expandable follow-on versions. The VT101 was essentially a base-model VT100, while the VT102 came standard with the AVO and serial printer port options pre-installed. The VT105 contained a simple graphics subsystem known as waveform graphics which was mostly compatible with same system in the earlier VT55. This system allowed two mathematical functions to be drawn to the screen superimposed over the normal text display, allowing text and graphics to be mixed to produce charts and similar output. The VT125 added an implementation of the byte-efficient Remote Graphic Instruction Set (ReGIS), which used custom ANSI codes to send graphics commands to the terminal, rather than requiring the terminal to be set to a separate less-efficient &quot;graphics mode&quot; like the VT105.

The VT131 added block mode support, allowing a form to be sent to the terminal and filled in locally by the user, and then sending the contents of the fields in the form back to the host when the form is filled in.

The VT100 form factor left significant physical space in the case for expansion, and DEC used this to produce several all-in-one stand-alone minicomputer systems. The VT103 included a cardcage and 4×4 (8-slot) Q-Bus backplane, sufficient to configure a small 16-bit LSI-11 microcomputer system within the case, and supported an optional dual TU58 DECtape II block-addressable cartridge tape drive which could be used like a very slow disk drive. The VT180 (codenamed &quot;Robin&quot;) added a single-board microcomputer using a Zilog Z80 to run the CP/M operating system. The VT278 (DECmate) added a small PDP-8 processor, allowing the terminal to run Digital&#x27;s WPS-8 word processing software.

<doc id="56208" wikidata="Q431381" url="?curid=56208" title="Meteor Crater">
<text>Meteor Crater, or Barringer Crater, is an impact crater about east of Flagstaff and west of Winslow in the desert of northern Arizona, United States. The site had several earlier names, and fragments of the meteorite are officially called the Canyon Diablo Meteorite, after the adjacent Canyon Diablo.

Meteor Crater lies at an elevation of above sea level. It is about in diameter, some deep, and is surrounded by a rim that rises above the surrounding plains. The center of the crater is filled with of rubble lying above crater bedrock. One of the features of the crater is its squared-off outline, believed to be caused by existing regional jointing (cracks) in the strata at the impact site.

Despite an attempt to make the crater a public landmark, the crater remains privately owned by the Barringer family to the present day through their Barringer Crater Company. The Lunar and Planetary Institute, the American Museum of Natural History, and other science institutes proclaim it to be the &quot;best-preserved meteorite crater on Earth&quot;. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in November 1967.

==Formation==

The crater was created about 50,000 years ago during the Pleistocene epoch, when the local climate on the Colorado Plateau was much cooler and damper. The area was an open grassland dotted with woodlands inhabited by mammoths and giant ground sloths.

The object that excavated the crater was a nickel-iron meteorite about across. The speed of the impact has been a subject of some debate. Modeling initially suggested that the meteorite struck at up to , but more recent research suggests the impact was substantially slower, at . About half of the impactor&#x27;s bulk is believed to have been vaporized during its descent through the atmosphere. Impact energy has been estimated at 10 megatons TNTe. The meteorite was mostly vaporized upon impact, leaving few remains in the crater.

Since the crater&#x27;s formation, the rim is thought to have lost of height at the rim crest as a result of natural erosion. Similarly, the basin of the crater is thought to have roughly of additional postimpact sedimentation from lake sediments and alluvium. Very few remaining craters are visible on Earth, since many have been erased by erosive geological processes. The relatively young age of Meteor Crater, paired with the dry Arizona climate, has allowed this crater to remain comparatively unchanged since its formation. The lack of erosion that preserved the crater&#x27;s shape greatly accelerated its groundbreaking recognition as an impact crater from a natural celestial body.

==Discovery and investigation==

Meteor Crater came to the attention of scientists after American settlers encountered it in the 19th century. The crater was given several early names, including &quot;Coon Mountain&quot;, &quot;Coon Butte&quot;, &quot;Crater Mountain&quot;, &quot;Meteor Mountain,&quot; and &quot;Meteor Crater.&quot; Daniel M. Barringer was one of the first people to suggest that the crater was produced by a meteorite impact, with the Barringer family filing mining claims and purchasing it and its surroundings in the early 20th century. This led to the crater also being known as &quot;Barringer Crater.&quot; Meteorites from the area are called Canyon Diablo meteorites, after Canyon Diablo, Arizona, which was the closest community to the crater in the late 19th century. The canyon also crosses the strewn field, where meteorites from the crater-forming event are found. The crater was initially assumed to have been formed by a volcanic steam explosion; evidence of geologically recent volcanic activity occurs across this part of Arizona – the southeastern edge of the San Francisco volcanic field is only about northwest of Meteor Crater.

===Albert E. Foote===
In 1891, mineralogist Albert E. Foote presented the first scientific paper about the meteorites of Northern Arizona. Several years earlier, Foote had received an iron rock for analysis from a railroad executive. Foote immediately recognized the rock as a meteorite and led an expedition to search and retrieve additional meteorite samples. The team collected samples ranging from small fragments to over . Foote identified several minerals in the meteorites, including microscopic diamonds. His paper to the Association for the Advancement of Science provided the first geological description of Meteor Crater to a scientific community.

===Grove Karl Gilbert===
In November 1891, Grove Karl Gilbert, chief geologist for the U.S. Geological Survey, investigated the crater and concluded that it was the result of a volcanic steam explosion. Gilbert assumed that, if it were an impact crater, then the volume of the crater, as well as meteoritic material, should still be present in the crater&#x27;s rim. Gilbert also assumed a large portion of the meteorite should be buried in the crater and that this should generate a large magnetic anomaly. Gilbert&#x27;s calculations showed that the volume of the crater and the debris on the rim were roughly equivalent, which meant that the mass of the hypothetical impactor was missing. There were also no detectable magnetic anomalies; he argued that the meteorite fragments found on the rim were coincidental or placed there. Gilbert publicized his conclusions in a series of lectures. In 1892, Gilbert would be among the first scientists to propose that the Moon&#x27;s craters were caused by impact rather than volcanism.

=== Daniel M. Barringer ===
Mining engineer and businessman Daniel M. Barringer suspected that the crater had been produced by the impact of a large iron meteorite. The theory that the crater was of meteoric origin had been met with skepticism. At the time, the craters visible on the Moon were thought to be volcanic, and no one had conclusively proved that impact craters existed.

Barringer had amassed a small fortune as an investor in the successful Commonwealth Mine in Pearce, Cochise County, Arizona. Barringer believed that the bulk of the Meteor Crater impactor could still be found under the crater floor. Impact physics was poorly understood at the time, and Barringer was unaware that most of the meteorite had vaporized on impact. Barringer incorporated a company, the Standard Iron Company, and staked a mining claim on the land, hoping to mine the asteroid that had produced the crater. He estimated from the size of the crater that the meteorite had a mass of 10 million tons.

The metal content of the iron meteorites found around the crater was valued at the time at US$125/ton, so Barringer was searching for a lode he believed to be worth more than a billion 1903 dollars. &quot;By 1928, Barringer had sunk the majority of his fortune into the crater – $500,000, or roughly $7 million in 2017 dollars.&quot;

Barringer spent 27 years trying to locate the nonexistent deposit of meteoric iron, and drilled to a depth of , but no significant deposit was ever found.

Barringer was politically well-connected. He received a land patent signed by Theodore Roosevelt for 640 acres (1 sq mi, 260 ha) around the center of the crater in 1903. In 1906, at his request, President Roosevelt also authorized the establishment of a post office unconventionally named &quot;Meteor&quot;, located at Sunshine, a stop on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, north of the crater. The Meteor post office closed on April 15, 1912, due to disuse.

In 1929, astronomer F.R. Moulton was employed by the Barringer Crater Company to investigate the physics of the impact event. Moulton concluded that the impactor likely weighed as little as 300,000 tonnes, and that the impact of such a body would have generated enough heat to vaporize the impactor instantly. Barringer died just ten days after the publication of Moulton&#x27;s second report.

By this time, &quot;the great weight of scientific opinion had swung around to the accuracy of the impact hypothesis ... Apparently an idea, too radical and new for acceptance in 1905, no matter how logical, had gradually grown respectable during the intervening 20 years.&quot;

=== Harvey H. Nininger ===

Harvey Harlow Nininger was an American meteoriticist and educator, and he initiated a widepsread interest in the scientific study of meteorites in the 1930s, and assembled the largest personal collection of meteorites up to that time. While based in Denver, Colorado, Nininger published the first edition of a pamphlet titled &quot;A Comet Strikes the Earth&quot;, which described how Meteor Crater formed when an asteroid impacted the Earth. In 1942, Nininger moved his home and business from Denver to the Meteor Crater Observatory, located near the turn-off for Meteor Crater on Route 66. He christened the building the &quot;American Meteorite Museum&quot; and published a number of meteorite and Meteor Crater-related books from the location. He also conducted a wide range of research at the crater, discovering impactite, iron-nickel spherules related to the impact and vaporization of the asteroid, and the presence of many other features, such as half-melted slugs of meteoric iron mixed with melted target rock. Nininger&#x27;s discoveries were compiled and published in a seminal work, &quot;Arizona&#x27;s Meteorite Crater&quot; (1956). Nininger&#x27;s extensive sampling and fieldwork in the 1930s and 40s contributed significantly to the scientific community&#x27;s acceptance of the idea that Meteor Crater formed by the impact of an asteroid. Many of his discoveries were later observed at other relatively fresh impact craters, including Henbury and Monturaqui.

Nininger believed that the crater should be a national monument and, in 1948, he successfully petitioned the American Astronomical Society to pass a motion in support of nationalizing the crater by making &quot;the unauthorized - and false - claim that the [Barringers] would be receptive to a fair purchase for the crater.&quot; By this time, mining activity at the crater had ceased, and the Barringers were in the process of planning a tourist attraction on the rim of the crater. Nininger was operating the American Meteorite Museum nearby, on Route 66, at the time. Nininger hoped that a public museum could be built on the crater&#x27;s rim, and that the project might lead to the founding of a federal institute of meteorite research. Offended by Nininger&#x27;s attempt to nationalize the crater, the Barringer family promptly terminated his exploration rights and ability to conduct further fieldwork at the crater. A few years later, in 1953, the Standard Iron Company was renamed the &quot;Barringer Crater Company,&quot; and a private museum was constructed on the crater rim.

===Eugene M. Shoemaker===

Eugene Merle Shoemaker continued investigations at the crater. A key discovery was the presence in the crater of the minerals coesite and stishovite, rare forms of silica found only where quartz-bearing rocks have been severely shocked by an instantaneous overpressure. Shocked quartz cannot be created by volcanic action; the only known mechanisms of creating it are naturally through lightning or an impact event, or artificially, through a nuclear explosion. In 1960, Edward C. T. Chao and Shoemaker identified coesite at Meteor Crater, adding to the growing body of evidence that the crater was formed from an impact generating extremely high temperatures and pressures. He confirmed what F.R. Moulton and H.H. Nininger already proposed: the impact vaporized the vast majority of the impactor. The pieces of Canyon Diablo meteorite found scattered around the site broke away from the main body before and during the impact. Shoemaker published his conclusions in his 1974 book, the &quot;Guidebook to the geology of Meteor Crater, Arizona.&quot;

Geologists used the nuclear detonation that created the Sedan crater, and other such craters from the era of atmospheric nuclear testing, to establish upper and lower limits on the kinetic energy of the meteor impactor.

==Geology==
The impact created an inverted stratigraphy, so that the layers immediately exterior to the rim are stacked in the reverse order to which they normally occur; the impact overturned and inverted the layers to a distance of 1–2 km outward from the crater&#x27;s edge. Specifically, climbing the rim of the crater from outside, one finds:
* Coconino Sandstone (sandstone formed 265 million years ago) nearest the top of the rim
* Toroweap Formation (limestone formed 255 million years ago)
* Kaibab Formation (dolostone formed 250 million years ago)
* Moenkopi Formation (mudstone formed 245 million years ago) nearest the outer foot of the rim

Soils around the crater are brown, slightly to moderately alkaline, gravelly or stony loam of the Winona series; on the crater rim and in the crater itself, the Winona is mapped in a complex association with rock outcrop.

==Recent history==

During the 1960s and 1970s, NASA astronauts trained in the crater to prepare for the Apollo missions to the Moon, and ongoing field training for astronauts continues to this day.

On August 8, 1964, two commercial pilots in a Cessna 150 flew low over the crater. After crossing the rim, they could not maintain level flight. The pilot attempted to circle in the crater to climb over the rim. During the attempted climb out, the aircraft stalled, crashed, and caught fire. The plane is commonly reported to have run out of fuel, but this is incorrect. Both occupants were severely injured, but survived. A small portion of the wreckage not removed from the crash site remains visible.

In 2006, a project called METCRAX (for METeor CRAter eXperiment) investigated &quot;the diurnal buildup and breakdown of basin temperature inversions or cold-air pools and the associated physical and dynamical processes accounting for their evolving structure and morphology.&quot;

== Tourist attraction ==
Meteor Crater is a popular tourist destination with roughly 270,000 visitors per year. The crater is owned by a family company, the Barringer Crater Company. Meteor Crater is an important educational and research site. It was used to train Apollo astronauts and continues to be an active training site for astronauts. The Meteor Crater Visitor Center sits on the north rim of the crater. It features interactive exhibits and displays about meteorites and asteroids, space, the Solar System, and comets including the American Astronaut Wall of Fame and such artifacts on display as an Apollo boilerplate command module (BP-29), a meteorite found in the area, and meteorite specimens from Meteor Crater that can be touched. Formerly known as the Museum of Astrogeology, the Visitor Center includes a Discovery Center &amp; Space Museum, a movie theater, a gift shop, and observation areas with views inside the rim of the crater. Guided tours of the rim are offered daily, weather permitting.

<doc id="56212" wikidata="Q1426327" url="?curid=56212" title="Linen">
<text>Linen () is a textile made from the fibers of the flax plant.

Linen is very strong and absorbent and dries faster than cotton. Because of these properties, linen is comfortable to wear in hot weather and is valued for use in garments. Linen textiles can be made from flax plant fiber, yarn, as well as woven and knitted. Linen also has other distinctive characteristics, such as its tendency to wrinkle. It takes significantly longer to harvest than a material like cotton although both are natural fibers. It is also more difficult to weave than cotton.

Linen textiles appear to be some of the oldest in the world; their history goes back many thousands of years. Dyed flax fibers found in a cave in Southeastern Europe (present-day Georgia) suggest the use of woven linen fabrics from wild flax may date back over 30,000 years. Linen was used in ancient civilizations including Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, and linen is mentioned in the Bible. In the 18th century and beyond, the linen industry was important in the economies of several countries in Europe as well as the American colonies.

Textiles in a linen weave texture, even when made of cotton, hemp, or other non-flax fibers, are also loosely referred to as &quot;linen&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;linen&quot; is of West Germanic origin and cognate to the Latin name for the flax plant, , and the earlier Greek ().

This word history has given rise to a number of other terms in English, most notably &quot;line,&quot; from the use of a linen (flax) thread to determine a straight line. It is also etymologically related to a number of other terms, including &quot;lining&quot;, because linen was often used to create an inner layer for clothing, and &quot;lingerie&quot;, from French, which originally denoted underwear made of linen.

== History ==
People in various parts of the world began weaving linen at least several thousand years ago. It was also recovered from Qumran Cave 1 near the Dead Sea.

=== Early history ===

The discovery of dyed flax fibers in a cave in Southern Caucasus, West Asia (modern day country, Georgia) dated to 36,000 years ago suggests that ancient people used wild flax fibers to create linen-like fabrics from an early date.

Fragments of straw, seeds, fibers, yarns, and various types of fabrics, including linen samples, dating to about 8,000 BC have been found in Swiss lake dwellings.

Woven flax textile fragments have been &quot;found between infant and child&quot; in a burial at Çatalhöyük, a large settlement dating to around 7,000 BC. To the southeast, in ancient Mesopotamia, flax was domesticated and linen was produced. It was used mainly by the wealthier class of the society, including priests. The Sumerian poem of the courtship of Inanna mentions flax and linen.

In ancient Egypt, linen was used for mummification and for burial shrouds. It was also worn as clothing on a daily basis; white linen was worn because of the extreme heat. For example, the Tarkhan dress, considered to be among the oldest woven garments in the world and dated to between 3482 and 3102 BC, is made of linen. Plutarch wrote that the priests of Isis also wore linen because of its purity. Linen was sometimes used as a form of currency in ancient Egypt. Egyptian mummies were wrapped in linen as a symbol of light and purity, and as a display of wealth. Some of these fabrics, woven from hand-spun yarns, were very fine for their day, but are coarse compared with modern linen. When the tomb of the Pharaoh Ramses II, who died in 1213 BC, was discovered in 1881, the linen wrappings were in a state of perfect preservation after more than 3000 years. In the Ulster Museum, Belfast there is the mummy of &#x27;Takabuti&#x27; the daughter of a priest of Amun, who died 2,500 years ago. The linen on this mummy is also in a perfect state of preservation.

The earliest written documentation of a linen industry comes from the Linear B tablets of Pylos, Greece, where linen is depicted as an ideogram and also written as &quot;li-no&quot; (Greek: λίνον, &quot;linon&quot;), and the female linen workers are cataloged as &quot;li-ne-ya&quot; (λίνεια, &quot;lineia&quot;).

=== Middle Ages ===

By the Middle Ages, there was a thriving trade in German flax and linen. The trade spread throughout Germany by the 9th century and spread to Flanders and Brabant by the 11th century. The Lower Rhine was a center of linen making in the Middle Ages. Flax was cultivated and linen used for clothing in Ireland by the 11th century. Evidence suggests that flax may have been grown and sold in Southern England in the 12th and 13th centuries. Textiles, primarily linen and wool, were produced in decentralized home weaving mills.

=== Modern history ===

Linen continued to be valued for garments in the 16th century and beyond. Specimens of linen garments worn by historical figures have survived. For example, a linen cap worn by Emperor Charles V was carefully preserved after his death in 1558.

There is a long history of the production of linen in Ireland. When the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, many of the Huguenots who fled France settled in the British Isles and elsewhere. They brought improved methods for linen production with them, contributing to the growth of the linen industry in Ireland in particular. Among them was Louis Crommelin, a leader who was appointed overseer of the royal linen manufacture of Ireland. He settled in the town of Lisburn near Belfast, which is itself perhaps the most famous linen producing center throughout history; during the Victorian era the majority of the world&#x27;s linen was produced in the city, which gained it the name Linenopolis. Although the linen industry was already established in Ulster, Louis Crommelin found scope for improvement in weaving, and his efforts were so successful that he was appointed by the Government to develop the industry over a much wider range than the small confines of Lisburn and its surroundings. The direct result of his good work was the establishment, under statute, of the Board of Trustees of the Linen Manufacturers of Ireland in the year 1711. Several grades were produced including coarse lockram. The Living Linen Project was set up in 1995 as an oral archive of the knowledge of the Irish linen industry, which was at that time still available within a nucleus of people who formerly worked in the industry in Ulster.

The linen industry was increasingly critical in the economies of Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. In England and then in Germany, industrialization and machine production replaced manual work and production moved from the home to new factories.

Linen was also an important product in the American colonies, where it was brought over with the first settlers and became the most commonly used fabric and a valuable asset for colonial households. The homespun movement encouraged the use of flax to make home spun textiles. Through the 1830s, most farmers in the northern United States continued to grow flax for linen to be used for the family&#x27;s clothing.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, linen was very significant to Russia and its economy. At one time it was the country&#x27;s greatest export item and Russia produced about 80% of the world&#x27;s fiber flax crop.

In December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres in order to raise people&#x27;s awareness of linen and other natural fibers.

One study suggests that the functional properties of linen fabric can be improved by incorporating chitosan-citric acid and phytic acid thiourea. The effects of this process include improved levels of antibacterial activity, increased wrinkle resistance, flame retardancy, UV protection, and antioxidant properties. Additionally, the linen fabric was able to retain durability for about 20 washes.

===Religion===
There are many references to linen throughout the Bible, reflecting the textile&#x27;s entrenched presence in human cultures.

In Judaism, the only law concerning which fabrics may be interwoven together in clothing concerns the mixture of linen and wool, called &quot;shaatnez&quot;; it is restricted in &quot;Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together&quot; and , &quot;...neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.&quot; There is no explanation for this in the Torah itself and it is categorized as a type of law known as &quot;chukim&quot;, a statute beyond man&#x27;s ability to comprehend. First-century Romano-Jewish historian Josephus suggested that the reason for the prohibition was to keep the laity from wearing the official garb of the priests, while medieval Sephardic Jewish philosopher Maimonides thought that the reason was that heathen priests wore such mixed garments. Others explain that it is because God often forbids mixtures of disparate kinds, not designed by God to be compatible in a certain way, with mixing animal and vegetable fibers being similar to having two different types of plowing animals yoked together; also, such commands serve both a practical as well as allegorical purpose, perhaps here preventing a priestly garment that would cause discomfort (or excessive sweat) in a hot climate.

Linen is also mentioned in the Bible in Proverbs 31, a passage describing a noble wife. says, &quot;She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.&quot; Fine white linen is also worn by angels in the New Testament (). In the Book of Joshua, Rahab, a prostitute in Jericho, hides two Israelite spies under bundles of flax.

== Uses ==

Many products can be made with linen, such as clothing, bed sheets, aprons, bags, towels (swimming, bath, beach, body and wash towels), napkins, runners, and upholstery. It is used especially in sailcloth and lent cloth, sewing threads, handkerchiefs, table cloth, sheets, collars, cuffs etc..

Today, linen is usually an expensive textile produced in relatively small quantities. It has a long staple (individual fiber length) relative to cotton and other natural fibers.

Linen fabric has been used for table coverings, bed coverings and clothing for centuries. The significant cost of linen derives not only from the difficulty of working with the thread but also because the flax plant itself requires a great deal of attention. In addition, flax thread is not elastic, and therefore it is difficult to weave without breaking threads. Thus linen is considerably more expensive to manufacture than cotton.

The collective term &quot;linens&quot; is still often used generically to describe a class of woven or knitted bed, bath, table and kitchen textiles traditionally made of flax-based linen but today made from a variety of fibers. The term &quot;linens&quot; refers to lightweight undergarments such as shirts, chemises, waist-shirts, lingerie (a cognate with &quot;linen&quot;), and detachable shirt collars and cuffs, all of which were historically made almost exclusively out of linen. The inner layer of fine composite cloth garments (as for example dress jackets) was traditionally made of linen, hence the word &quot;lining&quot;.

Over the past 30 years the end use for linen has changed dramatically. Approximately 70% of linen production in the 1990s was for apparel textiles, whereas in the 1970s only about 5% was used for fashion fabrics.

Linen uses range across bed and bath fabrics (tablecloths, bath towels, dish towels, bed sheets); home and commercial furnishing items (wallpaper/wall coverings, upholstery, window treatments); apparel items (suits, dresses, skirts, shirts); and industrial products (luggage, canvases, sewing thread). It was once the preferred yarn for hand-sewing the uppers of moccasin-style shoes (loafers), but has been replaced by synthetics.

A linen handkerchief, pressed and folded to display the corners, was a standard decoration of a well-dressed man&#x27;s suit during most of the first part of the 20th century.

Nowadays, linen is one of the most preferred materials for bed sheets due to its durability and hypoallergenic properties. Linen can be up to three times stronger than cotton. This is because the cellulose fibers in linen yarn are slightly longer and wrapped tighter than those found in cotton yarn. This gives it great durability and allows linen products to be long-lasting.

Currently researchers are working on a cotton/flax blend to create new yarns which will improve the feel of denim during hot and humid weather. Conversely, some brands such as 100% Capri specially treat the linen to look like denim.

Linen fabric is one of the preferred traditional supports for oil painting. In the United States cotton is popularly used instead, as linen is many times more expensive there, restricting its use to professional painters. In Europe, however, linen is usually the only fabric support available in art shops; in the UK both are freely available with cotton being cheaper. Linen is preferred to cotton for its strength, durability and archival integrity.

Linen is also used extensively by artisan bakers. Known as a couche, the flax cloth is used to hold the dough into shape while in the final rise, just before baking. The couche is heavily dusted with flour which is rubbed into the pores of the fabric. Then the shaped dough is placed on the couche. The floured couche makes a &quot;non stick&quot; surface to hold the dough. Then ridges are formed in the couche to keep the dough from spreading.

In the past, linen was also used for books (the only surviving example of which is the Liber Linteus). Due to its strength, in the Middle Ages linen was used for shields, gambesons, and bowstrings; in classical antiquity it was used to make a type of body armour, referred to as a linothorax. Additionally, linen was commonly used to make riggings, sail-cloths, nets, ropes, and canvases because the tensility of the cloth would increase by 20% when wet.

Because of its strength when wet, Irish linen is a very popular wrap of pool/billiard cues, due to its absorption of sweat from hands.

In 1923, the German city Bielefeld issued banknotes printed on linen. United States currency paper is made from 25% linen and 75% cotton.

==Flax fiber==
===Description===

Linen is a bast fiber. Flax fibers vary in length from about 25 to 150 mm (1 to 6 in) and average 12–16 micrometers in diameter. There are two varieties: shorter tow fibers used for coarser fabrics and longer line fibers used for finer fabrics. Flax fibers can usually be identified by their “nodes” which add to the flexibility and texture of the fabric.

The cross-section of the linen fiber is made up of irregular polygonal shapes which contribute to the coarse texture of the fabric.

===Properties===
Linen fabric feels cool to touch, a phenomenon which indicates its higher conductivity (the same principle that makes metals feel &quot;cold&quot;). It is smooth, making the finished fabric lint-free, and gets softer the more it is washed. However, constant creasing in the same place in sharp folds will tend to break the linen threads. This wear can show up in collars, hems, and any area that is iron creased during laundering. Linen&#x27;s poor elasticity means that it easily wrinkles.

Mildew, perspiration, and bleach can damage the fabric, but because it is not made from animal fibers (keratin) it is impervious to clothes moths and carpet beetles. Linen is relatively easy to take care of, since it resists dirt and stains, has no lint or pilling tendency, and can be dry-cleaned, machine-washed, or steamed. It can withstand high temperatures, and has only moderate initial shrinkage.

Linen should not be dried too much by tumble drying, and it is much easier to iron when damp. Linen wrinkles very easily, and thus some more formal garments require ironing often, in order to maintain perfect smoothness. Nevertheless, the tendency to wrinkle is often considered part of linen&#x27;s particular &quot;charm&quot;, and many modern linen garments are designed to be air-dried on a good clothes hanger and worn without the necessity of ironing.

A characteristic often associated with linen yarn is the presence of &quot;slubs&quot;, or small, soft, irregular lumps, which occur randomly along its length. In the past, slubs were traditionally considered to be defects, and were associated with low-quality linen. However, in the case of many present-day linen fabrics, particularly in the decorative furnishing industry, slubs are considered as part of the aesthetic appeal of an expensive natural product. In addition, slubs do not compromise the integrity of the fabric, and therefore they are not viewed as a defect. However, the very finest linen has very consistent diameter threads, with no slubs at all.

Linen can degrade in a few weeks when buried in soil. Linen is more biodegradable than cotton, making it an eco friendly fiber.

===Measure===
The standard measure of bulk linen yarn is the &quot;lea&quot;, which is the number of yards in a pound of linen divided by 300. For example, a yarn having a size of 1 lea will give 300 yards per pound. The fine yarns used in handkerchiefs, etc. might be 40 lea, and give 40x300 = 12,000 yards per pound. This is a specific length therefore an indirect measurement of the fineness of the linen, i.e., the number of length units per unit mass. The symbol is NeL. The metric unit, Nm, is more commonly used in continental Europe. This is the number of 1,000 m lengths per kilogram. In China, the English Cotton system unit, NeC, is common. This is the number of 840 yard lengths in a pound.

=== Production method ===
Linen is laborious to manufacture.


The quality of the finished linen product is often dependent upon growing conditions and harvesting techniques. To generate the longest possible fibers, flax is either hand-harvested by pulling up the entire plant or stalks are cut very close to the root. After harvesting, the plants are dried, and then the seeds are removed through a mechanized process called “rippling” (threshing) and winnowing.

The fibers must then be loosened from the stalk. This is achieved through retting, a process which uses bacteria to decompose the pectin that binds the fibers together. Natural retting methods take place in tanks and pools, or directly in the fields. There are also chemical retting methods; these are faster, but are typically more harmful to the environment and to the fibers themselves.

After retting, the stalks are ready for scutching, which takes place between August and December. Scutching removes the woody portion of the stalks by crushing them between two metal rollers, so that the parts of the stalk can be separated. The fibers are removed and the other parts such as linseed, shives, and tow are set aside for other uses. Next the fibers are heckled: the short fibers are separated with heckling combs by &#x27;combing&#x27; them away, to leave behind only the long, soft flax fibers.

After the fibers have been separated and processed, they are typically spun into yarns and woven or knit into linen textiles. These textiles can then be bleached, dyed, printed on, or finished with a number of treatments or coatings.

An alternate production method is known as “cottonizing” which is quicker and requires less equipment. The flax stalks are processed using traditional cotton machinery; however, the finished fibers often lose the characteristic linen look.

=== Producers ===

In 2018, according to the United Nations&#x27; repository of official international trade statistics, China was the top exporter of woven linen fabrics by trade value, with a reported $732.3 million in exports; Italy ($173.0 million), Belgium ($68.9 million) and the United Kingdom ($51.7 million) were also major exporters.

<text>A surcoat or surcote is an outer garment that was commonly worn in the Middle Ages by soldiers. It was worn over armor to show insignia and help identify what side the soldier was on. In the battlefield the surcoat was also helpful with keeping the sun off the soldier and their armor which helped prevent heat stroke and heat exhaustion. The name derives from French meaning &quot;over the coat&quot;, a long, loose, often sleeveless coat reaching down to the feet.

==History==
===Men&#x27;s surcoat===
From about the late 12th century, knights wore long, flowing surcoats. From the early to mid 13th century, these were frequently emblazoned with their personal arms, over their armour. These usually extended to about mid-calf, had slits in the bottom front and back, allowing the wearer to ride comfortably, and were either sleeved or sleeveless. Some historians believe that the practice of wearing white surcoats was adopted during the Crusades, their main purpose being to reflect the direct sun, which overheated the armour (and the soldier inside) – although it may be argued that here its color would have been of little help, while in poor weather they helped keep rain and the muck of battle away from the easily corroded mail links. The surcoat displayed the device of the knight (origin of the term &quot;coat of arms&quot;), thereby identifying him, which in turn, combined with the increased use of the great helm (late 12th century, early 13th century), became an essential means of recognition. Indeed, some historians cite this as one of the reasons behind the spread of heraldry across medieval Europe. In the early fourteenth century, the front of the knight&#x27;s surcoat was shortened so that it was longer at the back and knee-length at the front, allowing greater freedom of movement and eliminating the danger of a rider getting his spurs caught in the garment. By the mid-fourteenth century, it was replaced with the &quot;jupon&quot; (or &quot;gipon&quot;), a much shorter item, often padded for supplementary protection.

In the 15th century, once suits of plate armour became common, the surcoat was phased out of use. This period in the history of armour development, in which surcoats became increasingly rare, is referred to as the &quot;surcoatless period&quot; (1420–1485).

===Women&#x27;s surcoat===
Women began wearing surcoats during the 13th century, both with and without sleeves. A particular style, known as the sideless surcoat, developed as a fashion in the 14th century. This was a sleeveless, floor-length garment featuring exaggerated armholes, which at their most extreme were open from shoulder to hip, revealing the gown underneath. The narrow strip covering the torso, known as the plackard, was usually no more than a foot wide. The style drew criticism from some moralists, who thought the garment drew an inappropriate amount of attention to the female body. Despite this, sideless surcoats continued to be worn as ceremonial dress well into the 15th century, long after they had ceased to be fashionable. Some estimates place them being worn as state apparel as late as 1525.

<text>A technical, known as a non-standard tactical vehicle (NSTV) in United States military parlance, is a light improvised fighting vehicle, typically an open-backed civilian pickup truck or four-wheel drive vehicle modified to mount SALWs and heavy weaponry, such as a machine gun, automatic grenade launcher, anti-aircraft autocannon, rotary cannon, anti-tank weapon, anti-tank gun, ATGM, mortar, multiple rocket launcher, recoilless rifle, or other support weapon (somewhat like a light military gun truck or potentially even a self-propelled gun), etc.

== Etymology ==
The neologism &quot;technical&quot; describing such a vehicle is believed to have originated in Somalia during the Somali Civil War in the early 1990s. Barred from bringing in private security, non-governmental organizations hired local gunmen to protect their personnel, using money defined as &quot;technical assistance grants&quot;. Eventually the term broadened to include any vehicle carrying armed men.

However, an alternative account is given by Michael Maren, who says the term was first used in Somalia in the 1980s, after engineers from Soviet arms manufacturer &quot;Tekniko&quot; mounted weapons on vehicles for the Somali National Movement during the Somaliland War of Independence. Technicals have also been referred to as &quot;battlewagons&quot; and &quot;gunwagons&quot;.

In Russia and Ukraine, technicals are often referred to as &quot;tachanka&quot;, a reference to horse-drawn machine gun platforms from the First World War and Russian Civil War.

== Features ==
Among irregular militaries, often centered on the perceived strength and charisma of male warlords, the prestige of technicals is strong. According to one article, &quot;The Technical is the most significant symbol of power in southern Somalia. It is a small truck with large tripod machine guns mounted on the back. A warlord&#x27;s power is measured by how many of these vehicles he has.&quot;
Technicals are not commonly used by well-funded militaries that are able to procure purpose-built combat vehicles, because the soft-skinned civilian vehicles that technicals are based on do not offer much armor protection to crew and passengers.

Technicals fill the niche of traditional light cavalry. Generally costing much less than purpose-built combat vehicles, the major asset of technicals is speed and mobility, as well as their ability to strike from unexpected directions with automatic fire and light troop deployment. Further, the reliability of vehicles such as the Toyota Hilux is useful for forces that lack the repair-related infrastructure of a conventional military on land. However, in direct engagements they are no match for heavier vehicles, such as tanks or other armored fighting vehicles, and they are mostly helpless against any air support from a proper military. 

== History ==

=== Prototypes and early usage ===
Light improvised fighting vehicles date back to the first use of automobiles, and to the horse-drawn &quot;tachankas&quot; mounting machine guns in eastern Europe and Russia. At the Bombardment of Papeete during World War I, the French armed several Ford trucks with 37 mm guns to bolster their defense of the city. During the Spanish Civil War, field guns were fixed to trucks to act as improvised self-propelled guns, while improvised armored cars were constructed by attaching steel plates to trucks.

During World War II, various British and Commonwealth units, including the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), the No. 1 Demolition Squadron or &#x27;PPA&#x27; (Popski&#x27;s Private Army), and the Special Air Service (SAS) were noted for their exploits in the deserts of Egypt, Libya and Chad using unarmored motor vehicles, often fitted with machine guns. Examples of LRDG vehicles include the Chevrolet WB 30 cwt Patrol Truck and the Willys MB Jeep.

The SAS&#x27; use of heavily armed Land Rovers continued post war with their use of Series 1 Land Rovers and later Series 11A 1968 Land Rovers in the Dhofar Rebellion. The SAS painted their Land Rovers pink as it was found to provide excellent camouflage in the desert and they were nicknamed &#x27;Pink Panthers&#x27; or Pinkies. The SAS also used a more modern Land Rover Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) during the Gulf War.

=== Western Sahara ===
Tactics for employing technicals were pioneered by the Sahrawi People&#x27;s Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Polisario Front, fighting for independence against Mauritania (1975–79) and Morocco (1975–present) from headquarters in Tindouf, Algeria. Algeria provided arms and Land Rovers to Sahrawi guerrillas, who successfully used them in long-range desert raids against the less agile conventional armies of their opponents, recalling Sahrawi tribal raids (ghazis) of the pre-colonial period. Polisario later gained access to heavier equipment, but four-wheel drive vehicles remain a staple of their arsenal.

The Moroccan army quickly changed their strategy and created mounted units using technicals to challenge Polisario speed and hit and run strategies in the large desert, where the Moroccan units proved their efficiency.

=== Chadian–Libyan conflict ===
In 1987, Chadian troops equipped with technicals drove the heavily mechanized Libyan army from the Aozou Strip. The vehicles were instrumental in the victory at the Battle of Fada, and were driven over into Libya to raid military bases. It was discovered that these light vehicles could ride through anti-tank minefields without detonating the mines when driven at speeds over 100 km/h. The vehicles had become so famous that, in 1984, &quot;Time&quot; dubbed early stages of the conflict the &quot;Great Toyota War&quot;.

The Toyota War was unusual in that the force equipped with improvised vehicles prevailed over the force equipped with purpose-built fighting vehicles. MILAN anti-tank guided missiles provided by France were key to the Chadian success, while the Libyan forces were poorly deployed and organized.

=== The Troubles in Northern Ireland ===

Throughout the conflict in Northern Ireland (1960s-1998), the Provisional IRA fitted vehicles, especially vans and trucks, with automatic weapons, heavy machine guns, and also improvised mortars. Sometimes the vehicles were armored with welded plates and sandbags. The IRA employed tractors and trailers to transport and fire improvised mortars, and heavy equipment to tear down fences and barbed wire and break into fortified security bases. Improvised flamethrowers were usually modified manure spreaders pulled to their targets by tractor.

=== Somali Civil War ===

Technicals played an important role in the 1990s Somali Civil War and the War in Somalia (2006–2009). Even prior to the collapse of the Somali Democratic Republic, camouflaged Toyota pickup trucks with mounted M2 Browning machine guns appeared in Somali military parades during the 1980s. After the fall of the Siad Barre regime and the collapse of the Somali National Army (SNA), it was rare for any Somali force to field armored fighting vehicles. However, technicals were very common.

Somali faction leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid used 30 technicals along with a force of 600 militia to capture Baidoa in September 1995. It was reported that after his death in 1996, his body was carried to his funeral on a Toyota pickup.

Proving their susceptibility to heavy weapons and their value as a military prize, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) was able to capture 30 &quot;battlewagons&quot; during the defeat of warlord Abdi Qeybdid&#x27;s militia at the Second Battle of Mogadishu in 2006. That September, an impressive array of 130 technicals was used to take Kismayo from the forces of the Juba Valley Alliance.

On November 13, 2006, then President of Puntland, General Adde Musa, personally led fifty technicals to Galkacyo to confront the Islamists. They were used a month later against the army of the Islamic Courts Union at the Battle of Bandiradley alongside Abdi Qeybdiid&#x27;s reconstituted militia.

However, forced into conventional battles in the War in Somalia (2006–2009), the unarmored technicals of the ICU proved no match for the T-55 tanks, Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships and fighter-bombers employed by Ethiopia.

=== War in Afghanistan ===

In the War in Afghanistan, U.S. special operations forces units such as the Green Berets were known to use technicals for patrol both because of the rugged terrain and the nature of their clandestine operations. The Taliban also use technicals in the bulk of their mobile fighting force.

=== Iraq War ===
Technicals were used by Iraqi military forces in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Iraqi Republican Guard and Fedayeen emulated tactics of the Somali National Alliance with limited success, but were outmatched by Coalition armor and aviation. In the aftermath of the invasion technicals saw use by Iraqi insurgents for transporting personnel and quick raids against the Iraqi police forces. The insurgent use of technicals increased after the Iraq Spring Fighting of 2004.

Many military utility vehicles have been modified to serve as gun trucks to protect Coalition convoys. The Humvee allows for weapon mounts by design, so it is not considered a technical.

The Coalition also supplied technicals to the Iraqi police. Private military contractors also use technicals and the United States military used modified Toyota Hiluxes, Land Cruisers, and other trucks as well.

=== Darfur conflict ===
Janjaweed militias use technicals on their raids against civilian villages in Darfur, Sudan, as do the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel troops in defense of their areas of operations. Light vehicles such as technicals are often thought to be more mobile than armored vehicles, but on one occasion an African peace-keeper driving a &quot;Grizzly&quot; AVGP whose guns had jammed, succeeded in catching up with, ramming and rolling over a fleeing Sudanese technical.

=== Lebanon ===
Introduced by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrilla groups, technicals were extensively employed by all factions involved in the Lebanese Civil War between 1975 and 1990, including the Christian Lebanese Front and the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) irregular militias, the Lebanese Army and the Internal Security Forces (ISF).
Opposition forces have reportedly used technicals in the fighting for the Chouf District during the May 2008 clashes in Lebanon.

=== Libyan Civil War ===

During the First Libyan Civil War, both regime loyalist forces as well as the anti-Gaddafi forces used technicals extensively. The type of warfare that had been carried out in the conflict—wherein highly mobile groups of soldiers and rebels continued to move to and from on the desert terrain, retreating at a time and then suddenly attacking to regain control of small towns and villages in the Eastern rebel held parts of Libya—had led to the technical becoming a vehicle of choice for both sides.

Technicals had also been widely used by the rebels whilst setting up checkpoints. It also formed a vast percentage of the rebel inventory which was limited to light weapons, light body armor and very few tanks. Some medium flatbed trucks carried the Soviet-made ZPU and ZU-23-2 towed anti-aircraft twin or quad barreled guns, as well as recoilless rifles and S-5 rocket helicopter rocket launcher pods. Some rebels have improvised with captured heavy weaponry, like BMP-1 turrets and helicopter rocket pods, as well as lower-tech methods such as using doorbells to ignite rocket-launched ammunition. Rebel technicals have also frequently employed BM-21 Grad rockets. Rocket tubes were salvaged from damaged regime Ural-375D trucks and mounted on the backs of pickups, with the technicals able to fire anywhere from one to six rockets.

=== Syrian Civil War ===
In the Syrian Civil War, technicals are extensively used as improvised fighting vehicles, especially by former opposition forces such as Jaysh al-Thuwar, who largely lack conventional fighting vehicles. Syrian government forces also used technicals, but on a smaller scale. The kind of weapons mounted on technicals varies widely, including machine guns, recoilless rifles, anti-aircraft autocannons (commonly ZPU and ZU-23-2) and even BMP-1 turrets. The Military of ISIL extensively used technicals in Iraq and Syria.

Peshmerga forces have used technicals to surround and attack ISIS targets.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===

==== War in Donbas ====
During the 2014 war in Donbas, both sides were using home-made military vehicles. OSCE monitors recorded 15 Russian armored utility vehicles (UAZ-23632-148 Esaul) in a training area near non-government-controlled Oleksandrivska in April 2021.

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====

Technicals were seen being used by Spetsnaz in Gomel, Belarus on February 24, 2022. Ukrainian forces reportedly used rocket launchers recovered from downed helicopters, mounted on technicals.

=== Yemeni Civil War ===
In the Yemeni Civil War, Houthis and Hadi/Alimi-aligned militias use technicals.

== Composition ==
Technicals consist of weapons mounted on a civilian vehicle, such as a four-wheel drive pickup truck. Many pickups have been used as technicals including Ford Ranger and Mitsubishi Triton, but the most favoured are the Toyota Hilux and Toyota Land Cruiser. They are typically fitted with heavy machine guns (especially the DShK and M2 Browning), anti-aircraft artillery (usually the ZPU or ZU-23-2), recoilless rifles (usually the SPG-9 or M40 recoilless rifle), anti-tank missiles launchers, multiple rocket launchers such as the Type 63 or the M-63 Plamen and in rare occasions rocket pods salvaged from downed attack helicopters like the S-5 rocket.

Due to being soft-skinned vehicles, optional add-on hardware include ballistic glass, turret gun shields and improvised vehicle armor such as made of welded steel plates as defense against small arms fire to increase survival chances.
A number of those technicals had their original tires changed to off-road tires, run-flat tires or specialized tires with central tire inflation system. As those modified tires improve technicals&#x27; performance on different terrains, while the run-flat tires or central tire inflation system equipped tires give the technicals opportunity to quickly get out of dangerous situations even when tires were damaged.

<doc id="56217" wikidata="Q43238" url="?curid=56217" title="Poaceae">
<text>Poaceae ( ), also called Gramineae ( ), is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants commonly known as grasses. It includes the cereal grasses, bamboos, the grasses of natural grassland and species cultivated in lawns and pasture. The latter are commonly referred to collectively as grass.

With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species, the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family, following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.

The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family, providing staple foods from domesticated cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice, oats, barley, and millet for people and as feed for meat-producing animals. They provide, through direct human consumption, just over one-half (51%) of all dietary energy; rice provides 20%, wheat supplies 20%, maize (corn) 5.5%, and other grains 6%. Some members of the Poaceae are used as building materials (bamboo, thatch, and straw); others can provide a source of biofuel, primarily via the conversion of maize to ethanol.

Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath. The leaf grows from the base of the blade, an adaptation allowing it to cope with frequent grazing.

Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant are estimated to constitute 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, excluding Greenland and Antarctica. Grasses are also an important part of the vegetation in many other habitats, including wetlands, forests and tundra.

Though they are commonly called &quot;grasses&quot;, groups such as the seagrasses, rushes and sedges fall outside this family. The rushes and sedges are related to the Poaceae, being members of the order Poales, but the seagrasses are members of the order Alismatales. However, all of them belong to the monocot group of plants.

== Description ==
Grasses may be annual or perennial herbs, generally with the following characteristics (the image gallery can be used for reference): The stems of grasses, called culms, are usually cylindrical (more rarely flattened, but not 3-angled) and are hollow, plugged at the nodes, where the leaves are attached. Grass leaves are nearly always alternate and distichous (in one plane), and have parallel veins. Each leaf is differentiated into a lower sheath hugging the stem and a blade with entire (i.e., smooth) margins. The leaf blades of many grasses are hardened with silica phytoliths, which discourage grazing animals; some, such as sword grass, are sharp enough to cut human skin. A membranous appendage or fringe of hairs called the ligule lies at the junction between sheath and blade, preventing water or insects from penetrating into the sheath.

Flowers of Poaceae are characteristically arranged in spikelets, each having one or more florets. The spikelets are further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the spikelet that bears the florets is called the rachilla. A spikelet consists of two (or sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed by one or more florets. A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two bracts, one external—the lemma—and one internal—the palea. The flowers are usually hermaphroditic—maize being an important exception—and mainly anemophilous or wind-pollinated, although insects occasionally play a role. The perianth is reduced to two scales, called &quot;lodicules&quot;, that expand and contract to spread the lemma and palea; these are generally interpreted to be modified sepals. The fruit of grasses is a caryopsis, in which the seed coat is fused to the fruit wall.
A tiller is a leafy shoot other than the first shoot produced from the seed.

=== Growth and development ===

Grass blades grow at the base of the blade and not from elongated stem tips. This low growth point evolved in response to grazing animals and allows grasses to be grazed or mown regularly without severe damage to the plant.

Three general classifications of growth habit present in grasses: bunch-type (also called caespitose), stoloniferous, and rhizomatous.
The success of the grasses lies in part in their morphology and growth processes and in part in their physiological diversity. There are both C3 and C4 grasses, referring to the photosynthetic pathway for carbon fixation. The C4 grasses have a photosynthetic pathway, linked to specialized Kranz leaf anatomy, which allows for increased water use efficiency, rendering them better adapted to hot, arid environments.

The C3 grasses are referred to as &quot;cool-season&quot; grasses, while the C4 plants are considered &quot;warm-season&quot; grasses.
* Annual cool-season – wheat, rye, annual bluegrass (annual meadowgrass, &quot;Poa annua&quot;), and oat
* Perennial cool-season – orchardgrass (cocksfoot, &quot;Dactylis glomerata&quot;), fescue (&quot;Festuca&quot; spp.), Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrass (&quot;Lolium perenne&quot;)
* Annual warm-season – maize, sudangrass, and pearl millet
* Perennial warm-season – big bluestem, Indiangrass, Bermudagrass and switchgrass.

Although the C4 species are all in the PACMAD clade (see diagram below), it seems that various forms of C4 have arisen some twenty or more times, in various subfamilies or genera. In the &quot;Aristida&quot; genus for example, one species (&quot;A. longifolia&quot;) is C3 but the approximately 300 other species are C4. As another example, the whole tribe of Andropogoneae, which includes maize, sorghum, sugar cane, &quot;Job&#x27;s tears&quot;, and bluestem grasses, is C4. Around 46 percent of grass species are C4 plants.

== Taxonomy ==
The name Poaceae was given by John Hendley Barnhart in 1895, based on the tribe Poeae described in 1814 by Robert Brown, and the type genus &quot;Poa&quot; described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek .

=== Evolutionary history ===
Grasses include some of the most versatile plant life-forms. They became widespread toward the end of the Cretaceous period, and fossilized dinosaur dung (coprolites) belonging to the sauropod titanosaurs have been found containing phytoliths of a variety that include grasses that are related to modern rice and bamboo. Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry deserts, cold mountains and even intertidal habitats, and are currently the most widespread plant type; grass is a valuable source of food and energy for all sorts of wildlife.

A cladogram shows subfamilies and approximate species numbers in brackets:

Before 2005, fossil findings indicated that grasses evolved around 55 million years ago. Finds of grass-like phytoliths in Cretaceous dinosaur coprolites from the latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) aged Lameta Formation of India have pushed this date back to 66 million years ago. In 2011, fossils from the same deposit were found to belong to the modern rice tribe Oryzeae, suggesting substantial diversification of major lineages by this time.

In 2018, a study described grass microfossils extracted from the teeth of the hadrosauroid dinosaur &quot;Equijubus normani&quot; from northern China, dating to the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous approximately 113–100 million years ago, which were found to belong to primitive lineages within Poaceae, similar in position to the Anomochlooideae. These are currently the oldest known grass fossils.

Fossils of &quot;Phragmites&quot; have been found in the Late Cretaceous of North America, particularly in the Maastrichtian aged Laramie Formation. However slightly older fossils of 
&quot;Phragmites&quot; have been found in the Eastern coast of the US dating the Campanian (such as in the Black Creek Formation). 

The relationships among the three subfamilies Bambusoideae, Oryzoideae and Pooideae in the BOP clade have been resolved: Bambusoideae and Pooideae are more closely related to each other than to Oryzoideae. This separation occurred within the relatively short time span of about 4 million years.

According to Lester Charles King, the spread of grasses in the Late Cenozoic would have changed patterns of hillslope evolution favouring slopes that are convex upslope and concave downslope and lacking a free face were common. King argued that this was the result of more slowly acting surface wash caused by carpets of grass which in turn would have resulted in relatively more soil creep.

== Distribution ==
The grass family is one of the most widely distributed and abundant groups of plants on Earth. Grasses are found on every continent, including Antarctica. The Antarctic hair grass, &quot;Deschampsia antarctica&quot; is one of only two flowering plant species native to the western Antarctic Peninsula.

== Ecology ==

Grasses are the dominant vegetation in many habitats, including grassland, salt-marsh, reedswamp and steppes. They also occur as a smaller part of the vegetation in almost every other terrestrial habitat.
Grass-dominated biomes are called grasslands. If only large, contiguous areas of grasslands are counted, these biomes cover 31% of the planet&#x27;s land. Grasslands include pampas, steppes, and prairies.
Grasses provide food to many grazing mammals, as well as to many species of butterflies and moths.
Many types of animals eat grass as their main source of food, and are called &quot;graminivores&quot; – these include cattle, sheep, horses, rabbits and many invertebrates, such as grasshoppers and the caterpillars of many brown butterflies. Grasses are also eaten by omnivorous or even occasionally by primarily carnivorous animals.
Grasses dominate certain biomes, especially temperate grasslands, because many species are adapted to grazing and fire.

Grasses are unusual in that the meristem is near the bottom of the plant; hence, grasses can quickly recover from cropping at the top.
The evolution of large grazing animals in the Cenozoic contributed to the spread of grasses. Without large grazers, fire-cleared areas are quickly colonized by grasses, and with enough rain, tree seedlings. Trees eventually outcompete most grasses. Trampling grazers kill seedling trees but not grasses.

==Sexual reproduction and meiosis==

Sexual reproduction and meiosis have been studied in rice, maize, wheat and barley. Meiosis research in these crop species is linked to crop improvement, since meiotic recombination is an important component of plant breeding. Unlike in animals, the specification of both male and female plant germlines occurs late in development during flowering. The transition from the sporophyte phase to the gametophyte state is initiated by meiotic entry.

== Uses ==
Grasses are, in human terms, perhaps the most economically important plant family. Their economic importance stems from several areas, including food production, industry, and lawns. They have been grown as food for domesticated animals for up to 6,000 years and the grains of grasses such as wheat, rice, maize (corn) and barley have been the most important human food crops. Grasses are also used in the manufacture of thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, timber for fencing, furniture, scaffolding and construction materials, floor matting, sports turf and baskets.

=== Food production ===
Of all crops grown, 70% are grasses. Agricultural grasses grown for their edible seeds are called &quot;cereals&quot; or &quot;grains&quot; (although the latter term, when used agriculturally, refers to both cereals and similar seeds of other plant species, such as buckwheat and legumes). Three cereals—rice, wheat, and maize (corn)—provide more than half of all calories consumed by humans. Cereals constitute the major source of carbohydrates for humans and perhaps the major source of protein; these include rice (in southern and eastern Asia), maize (in Central and South America), and wheat and barley (in Europe, northern Asia and the Americas).

Sugarcane is the major source of sugar production. Additional food uses of sugarcane include sprouted grain, shoots, and rhizomes, and in drink they include sugarcane juice and plant milk, as well as rum, beer, whisky, and vodka.

Bamboo shoots are used in numerous Asian dishes and broths, and are available in supermarkets in various sliced forms, in both fresh, fermented and canned versions.

Lemongrass is a grass used as a culinary herb for its citrus-like flavor and scent.

Many species of grass are grown as pasture for foraging or as fodder for prescribed livestock feeds, particularly in the case of cattle, horses, and sheep. Such grasses may be cut and stored for later feeding, especially for the winter, in the form of bales of hay or straw, or in silos as silage. Straw (and sometimes hay) may also be used as bedding for animals.

An example of a sod-forming perennial grass used in agriculture is &quot;Thinopyrum intermedium&quot;.

=== Industry ===
Grasses are used as raw material for a multitude of purposes, including construction and in the composition of building materials such as cob, for insulation, in the manufacture of paper and board such as oriented structural straw board. Grass fiber can be used for making paper, biofuel production, nonwoven fabrics, and as replacement for glass fibers used in reinforced plastics. Bamboo scaffolding is able to withstand typhoon-force winds that would break steel scaffolding. Larger bamboos and &quot;Arundo donax&quot; have stout culms that can be used in a manner similar to timber, &quot;Arundo&quot; is used to make reeds for woodwind instruments, and bamboo is used for innumerable implements.

&quot;&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;&quot; (common reed) is important for thatching and wall construction of homes in Africa. Grasses are used in water treatment systems, in wetland conservation and land reclamation, and used to lessen the erosional impact of urban storm water runoff.

=== Palaeoecological reconstructions ===
Pollen morphology, particularly in the &quot;Poaceae&quot; family, is key to figuring out their evolutionary relationships and how environments have changed over time. Grass pollen grains, however, often look the same, making it hard to use them for detailed climate or environmental reconstructions. Grass pollen has a single pore and can vary a lot in size, from about 20 to over 100 micrometers, and this size difference has been looked into for clues about past habitats, to tell apart domesticated grasses from wild ones, and to indicate various biological features like how they perform photosynthesis, their breeding systems, and genetic complexity. Yet, there&#x27;s ongoing debate about how effective pollen size is for piecing together historical landscapes and weather patterns, considering other factors such as genetic material amount might also affect pollen size. Despite these challenges, new techniques in Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and improved statistical methods are now helping to better identify these similar-looking pollen types.

=== Lawn and ornamental use ===
Grasses are the primary plants used in lawns, which themselves derive from grazed grasslands in Europe. They also provide an important means of erosion control (e.g. along roadsides), especially on sloping land. Grass lawns are an important covering of playing surfaces in many sports, including football (soccer), American football, tennis, golf, cricket, softball and baseball.

Ornamental grasses, such as perennial bunch grasses, are used in many styles of garden design for their foliage, inflorescences and seed heads. They are often used in natural landscaping, xeriscaping and slope and beach stabilization in contemporary landscaping, wildlife gardening, and native plant gardening. They are used as screens and hedges.

=== Sports turf ===

Grass playing fields, courses and pitches are the traditional playing surfaces for many sports, including American football, association football, baseball, cricket, golf, and rugby. Grass surfaces are also sometimes used for horse racing and tennis. Type of maintenance and species of grass used may be important factors for some sports, less critical for others. In some sports facilities, including indoor domes and other places where maintenance of a grass field would be difficult, grass may be replaced with artificial turf, a synthetic grass-like substitute.

==== Cricket ====
In cricket, the pitch is the strip of carefully mowed and rolled grass where the bowler bowls. In the days leading up to the match it is repeatedly mowed and rolled to produce a very hard, flat surface for the ball to bounce off.

==== Golf ====

Grass on golf courses is kept in three distinct conditions: that of the &quot;rough&quot;, the &quot;fairway&quot;, and the &quot;putting green&quot;. Grass on the fairway is mown short and even, allowing the player to strike the ball cleanly. Playing from the rough is a disadvantage because the long grass may affect the flight of the ball. Grass on the putting green is the shortest and most even, ideally allowing the ball to roll smoothly over the surface. An entire industry revolves around the development and marketing of turf grass varieties.

==== Tennis ====

In tennis, grass is grown on very hard-packed soil, and the bounce of a tennis ball may vary depending on the grass&#x27;s health, how recently it has been mowed, and the wear and tear of recent play. The surface is softer than hard courts and clay (other tennis surfaces), so the ball bounces lower, and players must reach the ball faster resulting in a different style of play which may suit some players more than others. Among the world&#x27;s most prestigious court for grass tennis is Centre Court at Wimbledon, London, which hosts the final of the annual Wimbledon Championships in England, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments.

=== Economically important grasses ===
A number of grasses are invasive species that damage natural ecosystems, including forms of &quot;Phragmites australis&quot; which are native to Eurasia but has spread around the world.
== Role in society ==

Grasses have long had significance in human society. They have been cultivated as feed for people and domesticated animals for thousands of years. The primary ingredient of beer is usually barley or wheat, each of which has been used for this purpose for over 4,000 years.

In some places, particularly in suburban areas, the maintenance of a grass lawn is a sign of a homeowner&#x27;s responsibility to the overall appearance of their neighborhood. One work credits lawn maintenance to:

In communities with drought problems, watering of lawns may be restricted to certain times of day or days of the week. Many US municipalities and homeowners&#x27; associations have rules that require lawns to be maintained to certain specifications, sanctioning those who allow the grass to grow too long.

The smell of freshly cut grass is produced mainly by cis-3-Hexenal.

Some common aphorisms involve grass. For example:
* &quot;The grass is always greener on the other side&quot; suggests an alternate state of affairs will always seem preferable to one&#x27;s own.
* &quot;Don&#x27;t let the grass grow under your feet&quot; tells someone to get moving.
* &quot;A snake in the grass&quot; means dangers that are hidden.
* &quot;When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers&quot; tells of bystanders caught in the crossfire.
A folk myth about grass is that it refuses to grow where any violent death has occurred.

<text>The Piltdown Man was a paleoanthropological fraud in which bone fragments were presented as the fossilised remains of a previously unknown early human. Although there were doubts about its authenticity virtually from its announcement in 1912, the remains were still broadly accepted for many years, and the falsity of the hoax was only definitively demonstrated in 1953. An extensive scientific review in 2016 established that amateur archaeologist Charles Dawson was responsible for the fraudulent evidence.

In 1912, Dawson claimed that he had discovered the &quot;missing link&quot; between early apes and man. In February 1912, Dawson contacted Arthur Smith Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the Natural History Museum, stating he had found a section of a human-like skull in Pleistocene gravel beds near Piltdown, East Sussex. That summer, Dawson and Woodward purportedly discovered more bones and artifacts at the site, which they connected to the same individual. These finds included a jawbone, more skull fragments, a set of teeth, and primitive tools.

Woodward reconstructed the skull fragments and hypothesised that they belonged to a human ancestor from 500,000 years ago. The discovery was announced at a Geological Society meeting and was given the Latin name &quot;Eoanthropus dawsoni&quot; (&quot;Dawson&#x27;s dawn-man&quot;). The questionable significance of the assemblage remained the subject of considerable controversy until it was conclusively exposed in 1953 as a forgery. It was found to have consisted of the altered mandible and some teeth of an orangutan deliberately combined with the cranium of a fully developed, though small-brained, modern human.

The Piltdown hoax is prominent for two reasons: the attention it generated around the subject of human evolution, and the length of time – 41 years – that elapsed from its alleged initial discovery to its definitive exposure as a composite forgery.

==Find==

At a meeting of the Geological Society of London on 18 December 1912, Charles Dawson claimed that a workman at the Piltdown gravel pit had given him a fragment of the skull four years earlier. According to Dawson, workmen at the site discovered the skull shortly before his visit and broke it up in the belief that it was a fossilised coconut. Revisiting the site on several occasions, Dawson found further fragments of the skull and took them to Arthur Smith Woodward, keeper of the geological department at the British Museum. Greatly interested by the finds, Woodward accompanied Dawson to the site. Though the two worked together between June and September 1912, Dawson alone recovered more skull fragments and half of the lower jaw. The skull unearthed in 1908 was the only find discovered in situ, with most of the other pieces found in the gravel pit&#x27;s spoil heaps. French Jesuit paleontologist and geologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin participated in the uncovering of the Piltdown skull with Woodward.

At the same meeting, Woodward announced that a reconstruction of the fragments indicated that the skull was in many ways similar to that of a modern human, except for the occiput (the part of the skull that sits on the spinal column), and brain size, which was about two-thirds that of a modern human. He went on to indicate that, save for two human-like molar teeth, the jaw bone was indistinguishable from that of a modern, young chimpanzee. From the British Museum&#x27;s reconstruction of the skull, Woodward proposed that Piltdown Man represented an evolutionary missing link between apes and humans, since the combination of a human-like cranium with an ape-like jaw tended to support the notion then prevailing in England that human evolution began with the brain.
 The find was considered legitimate by Otto Schoetensack who had discovered the Heidelberg fossils just a few years earlier; he described it as being the best evidence for an ape-like ancestor of modern humans. Almost from the outset, Woodward&#x27;s reconstruction of the Piltdown fragments was strongly challenged by some researchers. At the Royal College of Surgeons, copies of the same fragments used by the British Museum in their reconstruction were used to produce an entirely different model, one that in brain size and other features resembled a modern human. This reconstruction, by Arthur Keith, was called &quot;Homo piltdownensis&quot; in reflection of its more human appearance. 

Woodward&#x27;s reconstruction included ape-like canine teeth, which was itself controversial. In August 1913, Woodward, Dawson and Teilhard de Chardin began a systematic search of the spoil heaps specifically to find the missing canines. Teilhard de Chardin soon found a canine that, according to Woodward, fitted the jaw perfectly. A few days later, Teilhard de Chardin moved to France and took no further part in the discoveries. Noting that the tooth &quot;corresponds exactly with that of an ape&quot;, Woodward expected the find to end any dispute over his reconstruction of the skull. However, Keith attacked the find. Keith pointed out that human molars are the result of side to side movement when chewing. The canine in the Piltdown jaw was impossible as it prevented side to side movement. To explain the wear on the molar teeth, the canine could not have been any higher than the molars. Grafton Elliot Smith, a fellow anthropologist, sided with Woodward, and at the next Royal Society meeting claimed that Keith&#x27;s opposition was motivated entirely by ambition. Keith later recalled, &quot;Such was the end of our long friendship.&quot;

As early as 1913, David Waterston of King&#x27;s College London published in &quot;Nature&quot; his conclusion that the sample consisted of an ape mandible and human skull. Likewise, French paleontologist Marcellin Boule concluded the same in 1915. A third opinion from the American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller Jr. concluded that Piltdown&#x27;s jaw came from a fossil ape. In 1923, Franz Weidenreich examined the remains and correctly reported that they consisted of a modern human cranium and an orangutan jaw with filed-down teeth.

===Sheffield Park find===
In 1915, Dawson claimed to have found three fragments of a second skull (Piltdown II) at a new site about away from the original finds. Woodward attempted several times to elicit the location from Dawson, but was unsuccessful. So far as is known, the site was never identified and the finds appear largely undocumented. Woodward did not present the new finds to the Society until five months after Dawson&#x27;s death in August 1916 and deliberately implied that he knew where they had been found. In 1921, Henry Fairfield Osborn, President of the American Museum of Natural History, examined the Piltdown and Sheffield Park finds and declared that the jaw and skull belonged together &quot;without question&quot; and that the Sheffield Park fragments &quot;were exactly those which we should have selected to confirm the comparison with the original type.&quot;

The Sheffield Park finds were taken as proof of the authenticity of the Piltdown Man; it may have been chance that brought an ape&#x27;s jaw and a human skull together, but the odds of it happening twice were slim. Even Keith conceded to this new evidence, though he still harboured personal doubts.

==Memorial==

On 23 July 1938, at Barkham Manor, Piltdown, Sir Arthur Keith unveiled a memorial to mark the site where Piltdown Man was discovered by Charles Dawson. Sir Arthur finished his speech saying:

The inscription on the memorial stone reads:

==Exposure==

===Scientific investigation===

From the outset, some scientists expressed scepticism about the Piltdown find (see above). Gerrit Smith Miller Jr., for example, observed in 1915 that &quot;deliberate malice could hardly have been more successful than the hazards of deposition in so breaking the fossils as to give free scope to individual judgment in fitting the parts together&quot;. In the decades prior to its exposure as a forgery in 1953, scientists increasingly regarded Piltdown as an enigmatic aberration, inconsistent with the path of hominid evolution as demonstrated by fossils found elsewhere.

In November 1953, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published evidence, gathered variously by Kenneth Page Oakley, Sir Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark and Joseph Weiner, proving that Piltdown Man was a forgery and demonstrating that the fossil was a composite of three distinct species. It consisted of a human skull of medieval age, the 500-year-old lower jaw of an orangutan and chimpanzee fossil teeth. Someone had created the appearance of age by staining the bones with an iron solution and chromic acid. Microscopic examination revealed file-marks on the teeth, and it was deduced from this that someone had modified the teeth to a shape more suited to a human diet.

The Piltdown Man hoax succeeded so well because, at the time of its discovery, the scientific establishment believed that the large modern brain preceded the modern omnivorous diet, and the forgery provided exactly that evidence. Stephen Jay Gould argued that nationalism and cultural prejudice played a role in the ready acceptance of Piltdown Man as genuine, because it satisfied European expectations that the earliest humans would be found in Eurasia, and the British in particular wanted a &quot;first Briton&quot; to set against fossil hominids found elsewhere in Europe.

===Identity of the forger===
The identity of the Piltdown forger remains unknown, but suspects have included Dawson, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Arthur Keith, Martin A. C. Hinton, Horace de Vere Cole and Arthur Conan Doyle.
The focus on Dawson as the main forger is supported by the accumulation of evidence regarding other archaeological hoaxes he perpetrated in the decade or two before the Piltdown discovery. The archaeologist Miles Russell of Bournemouth University analysed Dawson&#x27;s antiquarian collection, and determined that at least 38 of his specimens were fakes. Among these were the teeth of a multituberculate mammal, &quot;Plagiaulax dawsoni&quot;, &quot;found&quot; in 1891 (and whose teeth had been filed down in the same way that the teeth of Piltdown Man were to be some 20 years later); the so-called &quot;shadow figures&quot; on the walls of Hastings Castle; a unique hafted stone axe; the Bexhill boat (a hybrid seafaring vessel); the Pevensey bricks (allegedly the latest datable &quot;finds&quot; from Roman Britain); the contents of the Lavant Caves (a fraudulent &quot;flint mine&quot;); the Beauport Park &quot;Roman&quot; statuette (a hybrid iron object); the Bulverhythe Hammer (shaped with an iron knife in the same way as the Piltdown elephant bone implement would later be); a fraudulent &quot;Chinese&quot; bronze vase; the Brighton &quot;Toad in the Hole&quot; (a toad entombed within a flint nodule); the English Channel sea serpent; the Uckfield Horseshoe (another hybrid iron object) and the Lewes Prick Spur. Of his antiquarian publications, most demonstrate evidence of plagiarism or at least naive referencing. Russell wrote: &quot;Piltdown was not a &#x27;one-off&#x27; hoax, more the culmination of a life&#x27;s work.&quot; In addition, Harry Morris, an acquaintance of Dawson, had come into possession of one of the flints obtained by Dawson at the Piltdown gravel pit. He suspected that it had been artificially aged – &quot;stained by C. Dawson with intent to defraud&quot;. He remained deeply suspicious of Dawson for many years to come, though he never sought to discredit him publicly, possibly because it would have been an argument against the eolith theory, which Morris strongly supported.

Adrian Lister of the UK&#x27;s Natural History Museum has said that &quot;some people have suggested&quot; that there may also have been a second &#x27;fraudster&#x27; seeking to use outrageous fraud in the hope of anonymously exposing the original frauds. This was a theory first proposed by Miles Russell. He has explained that the piece nicknamed the &#x27;cricket bat&#x27; (a fossilised elephant bone) was such a crudely forged &#x27;early tool&#x27; that it may have been planted to cast doubt upon the other finds, the &#x27;Earliest Englishman&#x27; in effect being recovered with the earliest evidence for the game of cricket. This seems to have been part of a wider attempt, by disaffected members of the Sussex archaeological community, to expose Dawson&#x27;s activities, other examples being the obviously fraudulent &#x27;Maresfield Map&#x27;, the &#x27;Ashburnham Dial&#x27;, and the &#x27;Piltdown Palaeolith&#x27;. Nevertheless, the &#x27;cricket bat&#x27; was accepted at the time, even though it aroused the suspicions of some and ultimately helped lead to the eventual recognition of the fraud decades later.

In 2016, the results of an eight-year review of the forgery were released, identifying Dawson&#x27;s modus operandi. Multiple specimens demonstrated the same consistent preparation: application of the stain, packing of crevices with local gravel, and fixation of teeth and gravel with dentist&#x27;s putty. Analysis of shape and trace DNA showed that teeth from both sites belonged to the same orangutan. The consistent method and common source indicated the work of one person on all the specimens, and Dawson was the only one associated with Piltdown II. The authors did not rule out the possibility that someone else provided the false fossils to Dawson but ruled out several other suspects, including Teilhard de Chardin and Doyle, based on the skill and knowledge demonstrated by the forgeries, which closely reflected ideas fashionable in biology at the time. On the other hand, Stephen Jay Gould judged that Pierre Teilhard de Chardin conspired with Dawson in the Piltdown forgery. Teilhard de Chardin had travelled to regions of Africa where one of the anomalous finds originated, and resided in the Wealden area from the date of the earliest finds (although others suggest that he was &quot;without doubt innocent in this matter&quot;). Hinton left a trunk in storage at the Natural History Museum in London that in 1970 was found to contain animal bones and teeth carved and stained in a manner similar to the carving and staining on the Piltdown finds. Phillip Tobias implicated Arthur Keith in helping Dawson by detailing the history of the investigation of the hoax, dismissing other theories, and listing inconsistencies in Keith&#x27;s statements and actions. Other investigations suggest that the hoax involved accomplices rather than a single forger.

Richard Milner, an American historian of science, argued that Arthur Conan Doyle may have been the perpetrator of the Piltdown Man hoax. Milner noted that Doyle had a plausible motive—namely, revenge on the scientific establishment for debunking one of his favourite psychics—and said that &quot;The Lost World&quot; appeared to contain several clues referring cryptically to his having been involved in the hoax. Samuel Rosenberg&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;Naked is the Best Disguise&quot; purports to explain how, throughout his writings, Doyle had provided overt clues to otherwise hidden or suppressed aspects of his way of thinking that seemed to support the idea that Doyle would be involved in such a hoax. More recent research suggests that Doyle was not involved. In 2016, researchers at the Natural History Museum and Liverpool John Moores University analyzed DNA evidence showing that responsibility for the hoax lay with Dawson, who had originally &quot;found&quot; the remains. Dawson had initially not been considered the likely perpetrator, because the hoax was seen as being too elaborate for him to have devised; however, the DNA evidence showed that a supposedly ancient tooth Dawson had &quot;discovered&quot; in 1915 (at a different site) came from the same jaw as that of the Piltdown Man, suggesting that he had planted them both. That tooth, too, was later proven to have been planted as part of a hoax.

Chris Stringer, an anthropologist from the Natural History Museum, was quoted as saying: &quot;Conan Doyle was known to play golf at the Piltdown site and had even given Dawson a lift in his car to the area, but he was a public man and very busy[,] and it is very unlikely that he would have had the time [to create the hoax]. So there are some coincidences, but I think they are just coincidences. When you look at the fossil evidence[,] you can only associate Dawson with all the finds, and Dawson was known to be personally ambitious. He wanted professional recognition. He wanted to be a member of the Royal Society and he was after an MBE [sic]. He wanted people to stop seeing him as an amateur&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Early humans===
In 1912, the majority of the scientific community believed the Piltdown Man was the &quot;missing link&quot; between apes and humans. However, over time the Piltdown Man lost its validity, as other discoveries such as the Taung Child and Peking Man were made. R. W. Ehrich and G. M. Henderson note, &quot;To those who are not completely disillusioned by the work of their predecessors, the disqualification of the Piltdown skull changes little in the broad evolutionary pattern. The validity of the specimen has always been questioned&quot;. Eventually, during the 1940s and 1950s, more advanced dating technologies, such as the fluorine absorption test, proved scientifically that this skull was actually a fraud.

===Influence===
The Piltdown Man fraud significantly affected early research on human evolution. Notably, it led scientists down a blind alley in the belief that the human brain expanded in size before the jaw adapted to new types of food. Discoveries of Australopithecine fossils such as the Taung child found by Raymond Dart during the 1920s in South Africa were ignored because of the support for Piltdown Man as &quot;the missing link,&quot; and the reconstruction of human evolution was confused for decades. The examination and debate over Piltdown Man caused a vast expenditure of time and effort on the fossil, with an estimated 250+ papers written on the topic.

The book &quot;&quot; by L. Ron Hubbard features the Piltdown Man as a phase of biological history capable of leaving a person with subconscious memories of traumatic incidents that can only be resolved by use of Scientology technology. Recovered &quot;memories&quot; of this phase are prompted by one&#x27;s obsession with biting, hiding the teeth or mouth, and early familial issues. Nominally, this appears to be related to the large jaw of the Piltdown Man specimen. The book was first published in 1952, shortly before the fraud was confirmed, and has since been republished 5 times (most recently in 2007).

Creationists often cite the hoax (along with Nebraska Man) as evidence of an alleged dishonesty of paleontologists who study human evolution, although scientists themselves had exposed the Piltdown hoax (and the Nebraska Man incident was not a deliberate fraud). In November 2003, the Natural History Museum in London held an exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of the exposure of the fraud.

===Biases in the interpretation of the Piltdown Man===
The Piltdown case is an example of how race, nationalism, and gender influenced scientific and public opinion. Newspapers explained the seemingly primitive and contradictory features of the skull and jaw by attempting to demonstrate an analogy with non-white races, presumed at the time to be more primitive and less developed than white Europeans. The influence of nationalism resulted in the differing interpretations of the find: whilst the majority of British scientists accepted the discovery as &quot;the earliest Englishman&quot;, European and American scientists were considerably more sceptical, and several suggested at the time that the skull and jaw were from two different creatures and had been accidentally mixed up. Although Woodward suggested that the specimen discovered might be female, most scientists and journalists referred to Piltdown as a male. The only notable exception was the coverage by the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper, which referred to the discovery as a woman, but only to mock the suffragette movement, of which the &quot;Express&quot; was highly critical.

<text>The oersted (,; symbol Oe) is the coherent derived unit of the auxiliary magnetic field [[Oersted|H]] in the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). It is equivalent to 1 dyne per maxwell.

==Difference between CGS and SI systems==
In the CGS system, the unit of the H-field is the oersted and the unit of the B-field is the gauss. In the SI system, the unit ampere per meter (A/m), which is equivalent to newton per weber, is used for the H-field and the unit of tesla is used for the B-field.

==History==
The unit was established by the IEC in the 1930s in honour of Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted. Ørsted discovered the connection between magnetism and electric current when a magnetic field produced by a current-carrying copper bar deflected a magnetised needle during a lecture demonstration.

==Definition==

The oersted is defined as a dyne per unit pole. The oersted is (≈) amperes per meter, in terms of SI units.

The H-field strength inside a long solenoid wound with 79.58 turns per meter of a wire carrying 1 A is approximately 1 oersted. The preceding statement is exactly correct if the solenoid considered is infinite in length with the current evenly distributed over its surface.

The oersted is closely related to the gauss (G), the CGS unit of magnetic flux density. In vacuum, if the magnetizing field strength is 1 Oe, then the magnetic field density is 1 G, whereas in a medium having permeability (relative to permeability of vacuum), their relation is
: formula_1

Because oersteds are used to measure magnetizing field strength, they are also related to the magnetomotive force (mmf) of current in a single-winding wire-loop:
: formula_2

===Stored energy===

The stored energy in a magnet, called &quot;magnet performance&quot; or &quot;maximum energy product&quot; (often abbreviated BHmax), is typically measured in units of megagauss-oersteds (MG⋅Oe).

<text>Electrum is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, with trace amounts of copper and other metals. Its color ranges from pale to bright yellow, depending on the proportions of gold and silver. It has been produced artificially and is also known as &quot;green gold&quot;.

Electrum was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Old Kingdom of Egypt, sometimes as an exterior coating to the pyramidia atop ancient Egyptian pyramids and obelisks. It was also used in the making of ancient drinking vessels. The first known metal coins made were of electrum, dating back to the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 6th century BC.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;electrum&quot; is the Latinized form of the Greek word ἤλεκτρον (&quot;ḗlektron&quot;), mentioned in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, referring to a metallic substance consisting of gold alloyed with silver. The same word was also used for the substance amber, likely because of the pale yellow color of certain varieties. (It is from amber’s electrostatic properties that the modern English words &quot;electron&quot; and &quot;electricity&quot; are derived.) Electrum was often referred to as &quot;white gold&quot; in ancient times but could be more accurately described as pale gold because it is usually pale yellow or yellowish-white in color. The modern use of the term &quot;white gold&quot; usually refers to gold alloyed with any one or a combination of nickel, silver, platinum and palladium to produce a silver-colored gold.

==Composition==
Electrum consists primarily of gold and silver but is sometimes found with traces of platinum, copper and other metals. The name is mostly applied informally to compositions between 20–80% gold and 80–20% silver, but these are strictly called gold or silver depending on the dominant element. Analysis of the composition of electrum in ancient Greek coinage dating from about 600 BC shows that the gold content was about 55.5% in the coinage issued by Phocaea. In the early classical period the gold content of electrum ranged from 46% in Phokaia to 43% in Mytilene. In later coinage from these areas, dating to 326 BC, the gold content averaged 40% to 41%. In the Hellenistic period electrum coins with a regularly decreasing proportion of gold were issued by the Carthaginians. In the later Eastern Roman Empire controlled from Constantinople, the purity of the gold coinage was reduced.

==History==


Electrum is mentioned in an account of an expedition sent by Pharaoh Sahure of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt. It is also discussed by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;. It is also mentioned in the Bible, in the first chapter of the book of the prophet Ezekiel. 
===Early coinage===
The earliest known electrum coins, Lydian coins and East Greek coins found under the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, are currently dated to the last quarter of the 7th century BC (625–600 BC). Electrum is believed to have been used in coins c. 600 BC in Lydia during the reign of Alyattes.
Electrum was much better for coinage than gold, mostly because it was harder and more durable, but also because techniques for refining gold were not widespread at the time. The gold content of naturally occurring electrum in modern western Anatolia ranges from 70% to 90%, in contrast to the 45–55% of gold in electrum used in ancient Lydian coinage of the same geographical area. This suggests that the Lydians had already solved the refining technology for silver and were adding refined silver to the local native electrum some decades before introducing pure silver coins.

In Lydia, electrum was minted into coins weighing , each valued at &quot;stater&quot; (meaning &quot;standard&quot;). Three of these coins—with a weight of about —totaled one stater, about one month&#x27;s pay for a soldier. To complement the stater, fractions were made: the &quot;trite&quot; (third), the &quot;hekte&quot; (sixth), and so forth, including of a stater, and even down to and of a stater. The stater was about to . Larger denominations, such as a one stater coin, were minted as well.

Because of variation in the composition of electrum, it was difficult to determine the exact worth of each coin. Widespread trading was hampered by this problem, as the intrinsic value of each electrum coin could not be easily determined. This suggests that one reason for the invention of coinage in that area was to increase the profits from seigniorage by issuing currency with a lower gold content than the commonly circulating metal.

These difficulties were eliminated circa 570 BC when the Croeseids, coins of pure gold and silver, were introduced. However, electrum currency remained common until approximately 350 BC. The simplest reason for this was that, because of the gold content, one 14.1 gram stater was worth as much as ten 14.1 gram silver pieces.

<doc id="56227" wikidata="Q3179593" url="?curid=56227" title="Skin tag">
<text>A skin tag, or acrochordon (: acrochorda), is a small benign tumor that forms primarily in areas where the skin forms creases (or rubs together), such as the neck, armpit and groin. They may also occur on the face, usually on the eyelids. Though tags up to long have been seen, they are typically the size of a grain of rice. The surface of an acrochordon may be smooth or irregular in appearance and is often raised from the surface of the skin on a fleshy stalk called a peduncle. Microscopically, an acrochordon consists of a fibrovascular core, sometimes also with fat cells, covered by an unremarkable epidermis. However, tags may become irritated by shaving, clothing, jewelry or eczema.

==Etiology==

Skin tags are thought to occur from skin rubbing against skin, since they are often found in skin creases and folds. Studies have shown existence of low-risk human papillomaviruses 6 and 11 in skin tags, hinting at a possible role in their pathogenesis, although a 2012 study found no association between skin tags and either low- or high-risk HPV. Acrochorda have been reported to have a prevalence of 46% in the general population. A causal genetic component is thought to exist. They are also more common in women than in men. Acrochorda were once thought to be associated with colorectal polyps, but studies have shown no such connection exists. Rarely, they can be associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, acromegaly, or polycystic ovary syndrome.

Elevated blood sugar and insulin is linked to an increased incidence of skin tags through an unknown mechanism.

==Treatment==
Removal, if desired or warranted, can be done by a dermatologist, a general practitioner, or a similarly trained professional who may use cauterization, cryosurgery, excision, laser, or surgical ligation to remove the acrochorda. Varied home remedies are unsupported by medical evidence.

<text>A dairy is a place where milk is stored and where butter, cheese and other dairy products are made, or a place where those products are sold. It may be a room, a building or a larger establishment. In the United States, the word may also describe a dairy farm or the part of a mixed farm dedicated to milk for human consumption, whether from cows, buffaloes, goats, yaks, sheep, horses or camels.

The attributive &quot;dairy&quot; describes milk-based products, derivatives and processes, and the animals and workers involved in their production, for example dairyman, dairymaid, dairy cattle or dairy goat. A dairy farm produces milk and a dairy factory processes it into a variety of dairy products. These establishments constitute the global dairy industry, part of the food industry.

The word &quot;dairy&quot; comes from an Old English word for &quot;female servant&quot; as historically milking was done by dairymaids.

==Terminology==
Terminology differs between countries. In the United States, for example, an entire dairy farm is commonly called a &quot;dairy&quot;. The building or farm area where milk is harvested from the cow is often called a &quot;milking parlor&quot; or &quot;parlor&quot;, except in the case of smaller dairies, where cows are often put on pasture, and usually milked in &quot;stanchion barns&quot;. The farm area where milk is stored in bulk tanks is known as the farm&#x27;s &quot;milk house&quot;. Milk is then hauled (usually by truck) to a &quot;dairy plant&quot;, also referred to as a &quot;dairy&quot;, where raw milk is further processed and prepared for commercial sale of dairy products.

In New Zealand, farm areas for milk harvesting are also called &quot;milking parlours&quot;, and are historically known as &quot;milking sheds&quot;. As in the United States, sometimes milking sheds are referred to by their type, such as &quot;herring bone shed&quot; or &quot;pit parlour&quot;. Parlour design has evolved from simple barns or sheds to large rotary structures in which the workflow (throughput of cows) is very efficiently handled. In some countries, especially those with small numbers of animals being milked, the farm may perform the functions of a dairy plant, processing their own milk into saleable dairy products, such as butter, cheese, or yogurt. This on-site processing is a traditional method of producing specialist milk products, common in Europe.

In the United States a &quot;dairy&quot; can also be a place that processes, distributes and sells dairy products, or a room, building or establishment where milk is stored and processed into milk products, such as butter or cheese. In New Zealand English the singular use of the word &quot;dairy&quot; almost exclusively refers to a corner shop, or superette. This usage is historical as such shops were a common place for the public to buy milk products.

== History ==

Milk producing animals have been domesticated for thousands of years. Initially, they were part of the subsistence farming that nomads engaged in. As the community moved about the country, their animals accompanied them. Protecting and feeding the animals were a major part of the symbiotic relationship between the animals and the herders.

In the more recent past, people in agricultural societies owned dairy animals that they milked for domestic and local (village) consumption, a typical example of a cottage industry. The animals might serve multiple purposes (for example, as a draught animal for pulling a plow as a youngster, and at the end of its useful life as meat). In this case, the animals were normally milked by hand and the herd size was quite small, so that all of the animals could be milked in less than an hour—about 10 per milker. These tasks were performed by a &quot;dairymaid&quot; (&quot;dairywoman&quot;) or &quot;dairyman&quot;. The word &quot;dairy&quot; harkens back to Middle English &quot;dayerie&quot;, &quot;deyerie&quot;, from &quot;deye&quot; (female servant or dairymaid) and further back to Old English &quot;dæge&quot; (kneader of bread).

With industrialisation and urbanisation, the supply of milk became a commercial industry, with specialised breeds of cattle being developed for dairy, as distinct from beef or draught animals. Initially, more people were employed as milkers, but it soon turned to mechanisation with machines designed to do the milking.
Historically, the milking and the processing took place close together in space and time: on a dairy farm. People milked the animals by hand; on farms where only small numbers are kept, hand-milking may still be practised. Hand-milking is accomplished by grasping the teats (often pronounced &quot;tit&quot; or &quot;tits&quot;) in the hand and expressing milk either by squeezing the fingers progressively, from the udder end to the tip, or by squeezing the teat between thumb and index finger, then moving the hand downward from udder towards the end of the teat. The action of the hand or fingers is designed to close off the milk duct at the udder (upper) end and, by the movement of the fingers, close the duct progressively to the tip to express the trapped milk. Each half or quarter of the udder is emptied one milk-duct capacity at a time.

The &quot;stripping&quot; action is repeated, using both hands for speed. Both methods result in the milk that was trapped in the milk duct being squirted out the end into a bucket that is supported between the knees (or rests on the ground) of the milker, who usually sits on a low stool.

Traditionally the cow, or cows, would stand in the field or paddock while being milked. Young stock, heifers, would have to be trained to remain still to be milked. In many countries, the cows were tethered to a post and milked.

==Structure of the industry==

While most countries produce their own milk products, the structure of the dairy industry varies in different parts of the world. In major milk-producing countries most milk is distributed through whole sale markets. In Ireland and Australia, for example, farmers&#x27; co-operatives own many of the large-scale processors, while in the United States many farmers and processors do business through individual contracts. In the United States, the country&#x27;s 196 farmers&#x27; cooperatives sold 86% of milk in the U.S. in 2002, with five cooperatives accounting for half that. This was down from 2,300 cooperatives in the 1940s. In developing countries, the past practice of farmers marketing milk in their own neighbourhoods is changing rapidly. Notable developments include considerable foreign investment in the dairy industry and a growing role for dairy cooperatives. Output of milk is growing rapidly in such countries and presents a major source of income growth for many farmers.

As in many other branches of the food industry, dairy processing in the major dairy producing countries has become increasingly concentrated, with fewer but larger and more efficient plants operated by fewer workers. This is notably the case in the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In 2009, charges of antitrust violations have been made against major dairy industry players in the United States, which critics call &quot;Big Milk&quot;. Another round of price fixing charges was settled in 2016.

Government intervention in milk markets was common in the 20th century. A limited antitrust exemption was created for U.S. dairy cooperatives by the Capper–Volstead Act of 1922. In the 1930s, some U.S. states adopted price controls, and Federal Milk Marketing Orders started under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and continue in the 2000s. The Federal Milk Price Support Program began in 1949. The Northeast Dairy Compact regulated wholesale milk prices in New England from 1997 to 2001.

Plants producing liquid milk and products with short shelf life, such as yogurts, creams and soft cheeses, tend to be located on the outskirts of urban centres close to consumer markets. Plants manufacturing items with longer shelf life, such as butter, milk powders, cheese and whey powders, tend to be situated in rural areas closer to the milk supply. Most large processing plants tend to specialise in a limited range of products. Exceptionally, however, large plants producing a wide range of products are still common in Eastern Europe, a holdover from the former centralised, supply-driven concept of the market under Communist governments.

As processing plants grow fewer and larger, they tend to acquire bigger, more automated and more efficient equipment. While this technological tendency keeps manufacturing costs lower, the need for long-distance transportation often increases the environmental impact.

Milk production is irregular, depending on cow biology. Producers must adjust the mix of milk which is sold in liquid form vs. processed foods (such as butter and cheese) depending on changing supply and demand.

===Milk supply contracts===
In the European Union, milk supply contracts are regulated by Article 148 of Regulation 1308/2013 – &quot;Establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007&quot;, which permits member states to create a requirement for the supply of milk from a farmer to a raw milk processor to be backed by a written contract, or to ensure that the first purchaser of milk to make a written offer to the farmer, although in this case the farmer may not be required to enter into a contract.

Thirteen EU member states including France and Spain have introduced laws on compulsory or mandatory written milk contracts (MWC&#x27;s) between farmers and processors. The Scottish Government published an analysis of the dairy supply chain and the application of mandatory written contracts across the European Union in 2019, to evaluate the impact of the contracts where they have been adopted. In the UK, a voluntary code of best practice on contractual relationships in the dairy sector was agreed by industry during 2012: this set out minimum standards of good practice for contracts between producers and purchasers. During 2020 the UK government has undertaken a consultation exercise to determine which contractual measures, if any, would improve the resilience of the dairy industry for the future.

The Australian government has also introduced a mandatory dairy code of conduct.

==Farming==

When it became necessary to milk larger cows, the cows would be brought to a shed or barn that was set up with stalls (milking stalls) where the cows could be confined their whole life while they were milked. One person could milk more cows this way, as many as 20 for a skilled worker. But having cows standing about in the yard and shed waiting to be milked is not good for the cow, as she needs as much time in the paddock grazing as is possible. It is usual to restrict the twice-daily milking to a maximum of an hour and a half each time. It makes no difference whether one milks 10 or 1000 cows, the milking time should not exceed a total of about three hours each day for any cow as they should be in stalls and laying down as long as possible to increase comfort which will in turn aid in milk production. A cow is physically milked for only about 10 minutes a day depending on her milk letdown time and the number of milkings per day.

As herd sizes increased there was more need to have efficient milking machines, sheds, milk-storage facilities (vats), bulk-milk transport and shed cleaning capabilities and the means of getting cows from paddock to shed and back.

As herd numbers increased so did the problems of animal health. In New Zealand two approaches to this problem have been used. The first was improved veterinary medicines (and the government regulation of the medicines) that the farmer could use. The other was the creation of &quot;veterinary clubs&quot; where groups of farmers would employ a veterinarian (vet) full-time and share those services throughout the year. It was in the vet&#x27;s interest to keep the animals healthy and reduce the number of calls from farmers, rather than to ensure that the farmer needed to call for service and pay regularly.

This daily milking routine goes on for about 300 to 320 days per year that the cow stays in milk. Some small herds are milked once a day for about the last 20 days of the production cycle but this is not usual for large herds. If a cow is left unmilked just once she is likely to reduce milk-production almost immediately and the rest of the season may see her &quot;dried off&quot; (giving no milk) and still consuming feed. However, once-a-day milking is now being practised more widely in New Zealand for profit and lifestyle reasons. This is effective because the fall in milk yield is at least partially offset by labour and cost savings from milking once per day. This compares to some intensive farm systems in the United States that milk three or more times per day due to higher milk yields per cow and lower marginal labour costs.

Farmers who are contracted to supply liquid milk for human consumption (as opposed to milk for processing into butter, cheese, and so on—see milk) often have to manage their herd so that the contracted number of cows are in milk the year round, or the required minimum milk output is maintained. This is done by mating cows outside their natural mating time so that the period when each cow in the herd is giving maximum production is in rotation throughout the year.

Northern hemisphere farmers who keep cows in barns almost all the year usually manage their herds to give continuous production of milk so that they get paid all year round. In the southern hemisphere the cooperative dairying systems allow for two months of no productivity because their systems are designed to take advantage of maximum grass and milk production in the spring and because the milk processing plants pay bonuses in the dry (winter) season to carry the farmers through the mid-winter break from milking. It also means that cows have a rest from milk production when they are most heavily pregnant. Some year-round milk farms are penalised financially for overproduction at any time in the year by being unable to sell their overproduction at current prices.

Artificial insemination (AI) is common in all high-production herds in order to improve the genetics of the female offspring which will be raised for replacements. AI also reduces the need for keeping potentially dangerous bulls on the farm. Male calves are sold to be raised for beef or veal, or slaughtered due to lack of profitability. A cow will calve or freshen about once a year, until she is culled because of declining production, infertility or other health problems. Then the cow will be sold, most often going to slaughter.

==Industrial processing==


Dairy plants process the raw milk they receive from farmers so as to extend its marketable life. Two main types of processes are employed: heat treatment to ensure the safety of milk for human consumption and to lengthen its shelf-life, and dehydrating dairy products such as butter, hard cheese and milk powders so that they can be stored.

===Cream and butter===

Today, milk is separated by huge machines in bulk into cream and skim milk. The cream is processed to produce various consumer products, depending on its thickness, its suitability for culinary uses and consumer demand, which differs from place to place and country to country.

Some milk is dried and powdered, some is condensed (by evaporation) mixed with varying amounts of sugar and canned. Most cream from New Zealand and Australian factories is made into butter. This is done by churning the cream until the fat globules coagulate and form a monolithic mass. This butter mass is washed and, sometimes, salted to improve keeping qualities. The residual buttermilk goes on to further processing. The butter is packaged (25 to 50 kg boxes) and chilled for storage and sale. At a later stage these packages are broken down into home-consumption sized packs.

===Skimmed milk===
The product left after the cream is removed is called skim, or skimmed, milk. To make a consumable liquid a portion of cream is returned to the skim milk to make &quot;low fat milk&quot; (semi-skimmed) for human consumption. By varying the amount of cream returned, producers can make a variety of low-fat milks to suit their local market. Whole milk is also made by adding cream back to the skim to form a standardised product. Other products, such as calcium, vitamin D, and flavouring, are also added to appeal to consumers.

===Casein===
Casein is the predominant phosphoprotein found in fresh milk. It has a very wide range of uses from being a filler for human foods, such as in ice cream, to the manufacture of products such as fabric, adhesives, and plastics.

===Cheese===

Cheese is another product made from milk. Whole milk is reacted to form curds that can be compressed, processed and stored to form cheese. In countries where milk is legally allowed to be processed without pasteurisation, a wide range of cheeses can be made using the bacteria found naturally in the milk. In most other countries, the range of cheeses is smaller and the use of artificial cheese curing is greater. Whey is also the byproduct of this process. Some people with lactose intolerance are able to eat certain types of cheese. This is because some traditionally made hard cheeses, and soft ripened cheeses may create less reaction than the equivalent amount of milk because of the processes involved. Fermentation and higher fat content contribute to lesser amounts of lactose. Traditionally made Emmental or Cheddar might contain 10% of the lactose found in whole milk. In addition, the ageing methods of traditional cheeses (sometimes over two years) reduce their lactose content to practically nothing. Commercial cheeses, however, are often manufactured by processes that do not have the same lactose-reducing properties. Ageing of some cheeses is governed by regulations; in other cases there is no quantitative indication of degree of ageing and concomitant lactose reduction, and lactose content is not usually indicated on labels.

===Whey===
In earlier times, whey or milk serum was considered to be a waste product and it was, mostly, fed to pigs as a convenient means of disposal. Beginning about 1950, and mostly since about 1980, lactose and many other products, mainly food additives, are made from both casein and cheese whey.

===Yogurt===
Making yogurt is similar to making cheese, only the process is stopped before the curd becomes hard.

===Milk powders===
Milk is also processed by various drying processes into powders. Whole milk, skim milk, buttermilk, and whey products are dried into a powder form and used for human and animal consumption. The main difference between production of powders for human or for animal consumption is in the protection of the process and the product from contamination. Some people drink milk reconstituted from powdered milk, because milk is about 88% water and it is much cheaper to transport the dried product.

===Other milk products===
Kumis is produced commercially in Central Asia. Although traditionally made from mare&#x27;s milk, modern industrial variants may use cow&#x27;s milk.
In India, which produces 22% of global milk production (as at 2018), a range of traditional milk-based products are produced commercially.

==Milking==
Originally, milking and processing took place on the dairy farm itself. Later, cream was separated from the milk by machine on the farm, and transported to a factory to be made into butter. The skim milk was fed to pigs. This allowed for the high cost of transport (taking the smallest volume high-value product), primitive trucks and the poor quality of roads. Only farms close to factories could afford to take whole milk, which was essential for cheesemaking in industrial quantities, to them.

Originally milk was distributed in &#x27;pails&#x27;, a lidded bucket with a handle. These proved impractical for transport by road or rail, and so the milk churn was introduced, based on the tall conical shape of the butter churn. Later large railway containers, such as the British Railway Milk Tank Wagon were introduced, enabling the transport of larger quantities of milk, and over longer distances.

The development of refrigeration and better road transport, in the late 1950s, has meant that most farmers milk their cows and only temporarily store the milk in large refrigerated bulk tanks, from where it is later transported by truck to central processing facilities.

In many European countries, particularly the United Kingdom, milk is then delivered direct to customers&#x27; homes by a milk float.

In the United States, a dairy cow produced about of milk per year in 1950, while the average Holstein cow in 2019 produces more than of milk per year.

===Milking machines===

Milking machines are used to harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes inefficient or labour-intensive. One early model was patented in 1907. The milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder. It is made up of a claw, four teatcups, (Shells and rubber liners) long milk tube, long pulsation tube, and a pulsator. The claw is an assembly that connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the teatcups to the long pulse tube and long milk tube. (Cluster assembly) Claws are commonly made of stainless steel or plastic or both. Teatcups are composed of a rigid outer shell (stainless steel or plastic) that holds a soft inner liner or &quot;inflation&quot;. Transparent sections in the shell may allow viewing of liner collapse and milk flow. The annular space between the shell and liner is called the pulse chamber.

Milking machines work in a way that is different from hand milking or calf suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to massage milk from the teat by creating a pressure difference across the teat canal (or opening at the end of the teat). Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to the cow. The vacuum applied to the teat causes congestion of teat tissues (accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the pulsation chamber about once per second (the pulsation rate) to allow the liner to collapse around the end of teat and relieve congestion in the teat tissue. The ratio of the time that the liner is open (milking phase) and closed (rest phase) is called the pulsation ratio.

The four streams of milk from the teatcups are usually combined in the claw and transported to the milkline, or the collection bucket (usually sized to the output of one cow) in a single milk hose. Milk is then transported (manually in buckets) or with a combination of airflow and mechanical pump to a central storage vat or bulk tank. Milk is refrigerated on the farm in most countries either by passing through a heat-exchanger or in the bulk tank, or both.

The photo to the right shows a bucket milking system with the stainless steel bucket visible on the far side of the cow. The two rigid stainless steel teatcup shells applied to the front two quarters of the udder are visible. The top of the flexible liner is visible at the top of the shells as are the short milk tubes and short pulsation tubes extending from the bottom of the shells to the claw. The bottom of the claw is transparent to allow observation of milk flow. When milking is completed the vacuum to the milking unit is shut off and the teatcups are removed.

Milking machines keep the milk enclosed and safe from external contamination. The interior &#x27;milk contact&#x27; surfaces of the machine are kept clean by a manual or automated washing procedures implemented after milking is completed. Milk contact surfaces must comply with regulations requiring food-grade materials (typically stainless steel and special plastics and rubber compounds) and are easily cleaned.

Most milking machines are powered by electricity but, in case of electrical failure, there can be an alternative means of motive power, often an internal combustion engine, for the vacuum and milk pumps.

===Milking shed layouts===
====Bail-style sheds====
This type of milking facility was the first development, after open-paddock milking, for many farmers. The building was a long, narrow, &quot;lean-to&quot; shed that was open along one long side. The cows were held in a yard at the open side and when they were about to be milked, they were positioned in one of the bails (stalls). Usually, the cows were restrained in the bail with a breech chain and a rope to restrain the outer back leg. The cow could not move about excessively and the milker could expect not to be kicked or trampled while sitting on a (three-legged) stool and milking into a bucket. When each cow was finished, she backed out into the yard again. The UK bail, initially developed by Wiltshire dairy farmer Arthur Hosier, was a six standing mobile shed with steps that the cow mounted, so the herdsman did not have to bend so low. The milking equipment was much as today, a vacuum from a pump, pulsators, a claw-piece with pipes leading to the four shells and liners that stimulate and suck the milk from the teat. The milk went into churns, via a cooler.

As herd sizes increased a door was set into the front of each bail so that when the milking was done for any cow the milker could, after undoing the leg-rope and with a remote link, open the door and allow her to exit to the pasture. The door was closed, the next cow walked into the bail and was secured. When milking machines were introduced bails were set in pairs so that a cow was being milked in one paired bail while the other could be prepared for milking. When one was finished the machine&#x27;s cups are swapped to the other cow. This is the same as for &quot;Swingover Milking Parlours&quot; as described below except that the cups are loaded on the udder from the side. As herd numbers increased it was easier to double-up the cup-sets and milk both cows simultaneously than to increase the number of bails. About 50 cows an hour can be milked in a shed with 8 bails by one person. Using the same teat cups for successive cows has the danger of transmitting infection, mastitis, from one cow to another. Some farmers have devised their own ways to disinfect the clusters between cows.

====Herringbone milking parlours====
In herringbone milking sheds, or parlours, cows enter, in single file, and line up almost perpendicular to the central aisle of the milking parlour on both sides of a central pit in which the milker works (you can visualise a fishbone with the ribs representing the cows and the spine being the milker&#x27;s working area; the cows face outward). After washing the udder and teats the cups of the milking machine are applied to the cows, from the rear of their hind legs, on both sides of the working area. Large herringbone sheds can milk up to 600 cows efficiently with two people.

====Swingover milking parlours====
Swingover parlours are the same as herringbone parlours except they have only one set of milking cups to be shared between the two rows of cows, as one side is being milked the cows on the other side are moved out and replaced with unmilked ones. The advantage of this system is that it is less costly to equip, however it operates at slightly better than half-speed and one would not normally try to milk more than about 100 cows with one person.
====Rotary milking sheds====
Rotary milking sheds (also known as Rotary milking parlor) consist of a turntable with about 12 to 100 individual stalls for cows around the outer edge. A &quot;good&quot; rotary will be operated with 24–32 (~48–50+) stalls by one (two) milkers. The turntable is turned by an electric-motor drive at a rate that one turn is the time for a cow to be milked completely. As an empty stall passes the entrance a cow steps on, facing the center, and rotates with the turntable. The next cow moves into the next vacant stall and so on. The operator, or milker, cleans the teats, attaches the cups and does any other feeding or whatever husbanding operations that are necessary. Cows are milked as the platform rotates. The milker, or an automatic device, removes the milking machine cups and the cow backs out and leaves at an exit just before the entrance. The rotary system is capable of milking very large herds—over a thousand cows.

====Automatic milking sheds====
Automatic milking or &#x27;robotic milking&#x27; sheds can be seen in Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, and many European countries. Current automatic milking sheds use the voluntary milking (VM) method. These allow the cows to voluntarily present themselves for milking at any time of the day or night, although repeat visits may be limited by the farmer through computer software. A robot arm is used to clean teats and apply milking equipment, while automated gates direct cow traffic, eliminating the need for the farmer to be present during the process. The entire process is computer controlled.

====Supplementary accessories in sheds====
Farmers soon realised that a milking shed was a good place to feed cows supplementary foods that overcame local dietary deficiencies or added to the cows&#x27; wellbeing and production. Each bail might have a box into which such feed is delivered as the cow arrives so that she is eating while being milked. A computer can read the eartag of each animal to ration the correct individual supplement. A close alternative is to use &#x27;out-of-parlour-feeders&#x27;, stalls that respond to a transponder around the cow&#x27;s neck that is programmed to provide each cow with a supplementary feed, the quantity dependent on her production, stage in lactation, and the benefits of the main ration

The holding yard at the entrance of the shed is important as a means of keeping cows moving into the shed. Most yards have a powered gate that ensures that the cows are kept close to the shed.

Water is a vital commodity on a dairy farm: cows drink about 20 gallons (80 litres) a day, sheds need water to cool and clean them. Pumps and reservoirs are common at milking facilities. Water can be warmed by heat transfer with milk.

===Temporary milk storage===
Milk from a cow is transported to a nearby storage vessel by the airflow leaking around the cups on the cow or by a special &quot;air inlet&quot; (5–10 L/min free air) in the claw. From there it is pumped by a mechanical pump and cooled by a heat exchanger. The milk is then stored in a large vat, or bulk tank, which is usually refrigerated until collection for processing.

==Waste disposal and wastewater management==

In countries where cows are grazed outside year-round, waste disposal issues need to be dealt with. The most concentrated waste is at the milking shed, where the animal waste may be liquefied (during the water-washing process) or left in a more solid form, either to be returned to be used on farm ground as organic fertiliser.

In the associated milk processing factories, most of the waste is washing water that is treated, usually by composting, and spread on farm fields in either liquid or solid form. This is much different from half a century ago, when the main products were butter, cheese and casein, and the rest of the milk had to be disposed of as waste (sometimes as animal feed).

In the dairy industries, there are two main types of wastewater produced; dairy wastewater and cheese whey. Dairy wastewater consists of material losses from the dairy products, effluents from the washing of tanks and equipment and sanitary wastewater from toilets and sinks. The typical concentrations of BOD and total Kjeldahl nitrogen for dairy wastewater range from 1200 to 5000 mg/L and 30 to 200 mg/L, respectively. Cheese whey is the liquid remaining after the formation of curds. It contains important amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, lactic acid, fats, and salts and its BOD value can exceed 40,000 mg/L. Dairy wastewater management usually includes equalisation, neutralisation and physical separation followed by biological treatment, while cheese whey is treated in anaerobic digesters or passes through membranes for protein recovery.

In dairy-intensive areas, various methods have been proposed for disposing of large quantities of milk. Large application rates of milk on the land, or disposing in a hole, is problematic as the residue from the decomposing milk will block the soil pores and thereby reduce the water infiltration rate through the soil profile. As recovery of this effect can take time, any land-based application needs to be well managed and considered. Other waste milk disposal methods commonly employed include solidification and disposal at a solid waste landfill, disposal at a wastewater treatment plant, or discharge into a sanitary sewer.

==Associated diseases==
Dairy products manufactured under unsanitary or unsuitable conditions have an increased chance of containing bacteria. Proper sanitation practices help to reduce the rate of bacterial contamination, and pasteurisation greatly decreases the amount of contaminated milk that reaches the consumer. Many countries have required government oversight and regulations regarding dairy production, including requirements for pasteurisation.
* Leptospirosis is an infection that can be transmitted to people who work in dairy production sites through exposure to urine or to contaminated water or soil.
* Cowpox is a virus that today is rarely found in either cows or humans. It is a historically important disease, as it led to the first vaccination against the now eradicated smallpox.
* Tuberculosis can be transmitted from cattle, mainly via milk products that are unpasteurised. The disease has been eradicated from many countries by testing for the disease and culling suspected animals.
* Brucellosis is a bacterial disease transmitted to humans by dairy products and direct animal contact. Brucellosis has been eradicated from certain countries by testing for the disease and culling suspected animals.
* Listeria is a bacterial disease associated with unpasteurised milk, and can affect some cheeses made in traditional ways. Careful observance of the traditional cheesemaking methods achieves reasonable protection for the consumer.
* Crohn&#x27;s disease has been linked to infection with the bacterium &quot;M. paratuberculosis&quot;, which has been found in pasteurised retail milk in the UK and the USA. &quot;M. paratuberculosis&quot; causes a similar disorder, Johne&#x27;s disease, in livestock.

==Animal rights==
A portion of the population, including vegans and many Jains, object to dairy production as unethical, cruel to animals, and environmentally deleterious. They do not consume dairy products given these ethical concerns. They state that cattle suffer under conditions employed by the dairy industry and how they are eventually killed for meat once their milk production declines. 

Animal rights scholars consider dairy as part of the animal–industrial complex. According to Kathleen Stachowski, the animal–industrial complex &quot;naturalizes the human as a consumer of other animals,&quot; whose enormity includes &quot;its long reach into our lives, and how well it has done its job normalizing brutality toward the animals whose very existence is forgotten&quot;. She states that the corporate dairy industry, the government, and schools forms the animal–industrial complex troika of immense influence, which hides from the public&#x27;s view the animal rights violations and cruelties happening within the dairy industry. Stachowski also states that the troika &quot;hijacks&quot; schoolchildren by promoting milk in the K-12 nutrition education curriculum and making them &quot;eat the products of industrial animal production&quot;.

===Bovine growth hormone===

In 1937, it was found that bovine somatotropin (BST or bovine growth hormone) would increase the yield of milk. Several pharmaceutical companies developed commercial rBST products and they have been approved for use in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, India, Russia, and at least ten others. The World Health Organization, and others have stated that dairy products and meat from BST-treated cows are safe for human consumption. However, based on negative animal welfare effects, rBST has not been allowed in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, or the European Union since 2000 – and in the U.S. has lost popularity due to consumer demands for rBST-free cows, with only about 17% of all cows in America now receiving rBST.

<text>Cichlids ()
are fish from the family Cichlidae in the order Cichliformes. Traditionally Cichlids were classed in a suborder, the Labroidei, along with the wrasses (Labridae), in the order Perciformes, but molecular studies have contradicted this grouping. On the basis of fossil evidence, it first appeared in Argentina during the Early Eocene epoch, about 48.6 million years ago; however, molecular clock estimates have placed the family&#x27;s origin as far back as 67 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous period. The closest living relative of cichlids is probably the convict blenny, and both families are classified in the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; as the two families in the Cichliformes, part of the subseries Ovalentaria. This family is large, diverse, and widely dispersed. At least 1,650 species have been scientifically described, making it one of the largest vertebrate families. New species are discovered annually, and many species remain undescribed. The actual number of species is therefore unknown, with estimates varying between 2,000 and 3,000.

Many cichlids, particularly tilapia, are important food fishes, while others, such as the &quot;Cichla&quot; species, are valued game fish. The family also includes many popular freshwater aquarium fish kept by hobbyists, including the angelfish, oscars, and discus. Cichlids have the largest number of endangered species among vertebrate families, most in the haplochromine group. Cichlids are particularly well known for having evolved rapidly into many closely related but morphologically diverse species within large lakes, particularly Lakes Tanganyika, Victoria, Malawi, and Edward. Their diversity in the African Great Lakes is important for the study of speciation in evolution. Many cichlids introduced into waters outside of their natural range have become nuisances.

All cichlids practice some form of parental care for their eggs and fry, usually in the form of guarding the eggs and fry or mouthbrooding.
==Anatomy and appearance==
Cichlids span a wide range of body sizes, from species as small as in length (e.g., female &quot;Neolamprologus multifasciatus&quot;) to much larger species approaching in length (&quot;Boulengerochromis&quot; and &quot;Cichla&quot;). As a group, cichlids exhibit a similar diversity of body shapes, ranging from strongly laterally compressed species (such as &quot;Altolamprologus&quot;, &quot;Pterophyllum&quot;, and &quot;Symphysodon&quot;) to species that are cylindrical and highly elongated (such as &quot;Julidochromis&quot;, &quot;Teleogramma&quot;, &quot;Teleocichla&quot;, &quot;Crenicichla&quot;, and &quot;Gobiocichla&quot;). Generally, however, cichlids tend to be of medium size, ovate in shape, and slightly laterally compressed, and generally similar to the North American sunfishes in morphology, behavior, and ecology.

Cichlids share a single key trait - the fusion of the lower pharyngeal bones into a single tooth-bearing structure. A complex set of muscles allows the upper and lower pharyngeal bones to be used as a second set of jaws for processing food, allowing a division of labor between the &quot;true jaws&quot; (mandibles) and the &quot;pharyngeal jaws&quot;. Cichlids are efficient and often highly specialized feeders that capture and process a very wide variety of food items. This is assumed to be one reason why they are so diverse.

The features that distinguish them from the other families in the Labroidei include:
*A single nostril on each side of the forehead, instead of two
*No bony shelf below the orbit of the eye
*Division of the lateral line organ into two sections, one on the upper half of the flank and a second along the midline of the flank from about halfway along the body to the base of the tail (except for genera &quot;Teleogramma&quot; and &quot;Gobiocichla&quot;)
*A distinctively shaped otolith
*The small intestine&#x27;s left-side exit from the stomach instead of its right side as in other Labroidei

==Taxonomy==
Kullander (1998) recognizes eight subfamilies of cichlids: the Astronotinae, Cichlasomatinae, Cichlinae, Etroplinae, Geophaginae, Heterochromidinae, Pseudocrenilabrinae, and Retroculinae. A ninth subfamily, the Ptychochrominae, was later recognized by Sparks and Smith. Cichlid taxonomy is still debated, and classification of genera cannot yet be definitively given. A comprehensive system of assigning species to monophyletic genera is still lacking, and there is not complete agreement on what genera should be recognized in this family.

As an example of the classification problems, Kullander placed the African genus &quot;Heterochromis&quot; phylogenetically within Neotropical cichlids, although later papers concluded otherwise. Other problems center upon the identity of the putative common ancestor for the Lake Victoria superflock (many closely related species sharing a single habitat), and the ancestral lineages of Lake Tanganyikan cichlids.

Phylogeny derived from morphological characters shows differences at the genus level with phylogeny based on genetic loci. A consensus remains that the Cichlidae as a family are monophyletic.

In cichlid taxonomy, dentition was formerly used as a classifying characteristic, but this was complicated because in many cichlids, tooth shapes change with age, due to wear, and cannot be relied upon. Genome sequencing and other technologies transformed cichlid taxonomy.

Alternatively, all cichlid species native to the new world, can be classified under the subfamily Cichlinae, while Etroplinae can classify all cichlid species native to the old world.

==Distribution and habitat==
Cichlids are one of the largest vertebrate families in the world. They are most diverse in Africa and South America. Africa alone is host to at least an estimated 1,600 species. Central America and Mexico have about 120 species, as far north as the Rio Grande in South Texas. Madagascar has its own distinctive species (&quot;Katria&quot;, &quot;Oxylapia&quot;, &quot;Paratilapia&quot;, &quot;Paretroplus&quot;, &quot;Ptychochromis&quot;, and &quot;Ptychochromoides&quot;), only distantly related to those on the African mainland. Native cichlids are largely absent in Asia, except for 9 species in Israel, Lebanon, and Syria (&quot;Astatotilapia flaviijosephi&quot;, &quot;Oreochromis aureus&quot;, &quot;O. niloticus&quot;, &quot;Sarotherodon galilaeus&quot;, &quot;Coptodon zillii&quot;, and &quot;Tristramella&quot; spp.), two in Iran (&quot;Iranocichla&quot;), and three in India and Sri Lanka (&quot;Etroplus&quot; and &quot;Pseudetroplus&quot;). If disregarding Trinidad and Tobago (where the few native cichlids are members of genera that are widespread in the South American mainland), the three species from the genus &quot;Nandopsis&quot; are the only cichlids from the Antilles in the Caribbean, specifically Cuba and Hispaniola. Europe, Australia, Antarctica, and North America north of the Rio Grande drainage have no native cichlids, although in Florida, Hawaii, Japan, northern Australia, and elsewhere, feral populations of cichlids have become established as exotics.

Although most cichlids are found at relatively shallow depths, several exceptions do exist. The deepest known occurrences are &quot;Trematocara&quot; at more than below the surface in Lake Tanganyika. Others found in relatively deep waters include species such as &quot;Alticorpus macrocleithrum&quot; and &quot;Pallidochromis tokolosh&quot; down to below the surface in Lake Malawi, and the whitish (nonpigmented) and blind &quot;Lamprologus lethops&quot;, which is believed to live as deep as below the surface in the Congo River.

Cichlids are less commonly found in brackish and saltwater habitats, though many species tolerate brackish water for extended periods; &quot;Mayaheros urophthalmus&quot;, for example, is equally at home in freshwater marshes and mangrove swamps, and lives and breeds in saltwater environments such as the mangrove belts around barrier islands. Several species of &quot;Tilapia&quot;, &quot;Sarotherodon&quot;, and &quot;Oreochromis&quot; are euryhaline and can disperse along brackish coastlines between rivers. Only a few cichlids, however, inhabit primarily brackish or salt water, most notably &quot;Etroplus maculatus&quot;, &quot;Etroplus suratensis&quot;, and &quot;Sarotherodon melanotheron&quot;. The perhaps most extreme habitats for cichlids are the warm hypersaline lakes where the members of the genera &quot;Alcolapia&quot; and &quot;Danakilia&quot; are found. Lake Abaeded in Eritrea encompasses the entire distribution of &quot;D. dinicolai&quot;, and its temperature ranges from .

With the exception of the species from Cuba, Hispaniola, and Madagascar, cichlids have not reached any oceanic island and have a predominantly Gondwanan distribution, showing the precise sister relationships predicted by vicariance: Africa-South America and India-Madagascar. The dispersal hypothesis, in contrast, requires cichlids to have negotiated thousands of kilometers of open ocean between India and Madagascar without colonizing any other island, or for that matter, crossing the Mozambique Channel to Africa. Although the vast majority of Malagasy cichlids are entirely restricted to fresh water, &quot;Ptychochromis grandidieri&quot; and &quot;Paretroplus polyactis&quot; are commonly found in coastal brackish water and apparently are salt tolerant, as is also the case for &quot;Etroplus maculatus&quot; and &quot;E. suratensis&quot; from India and Sri Lanka.

==Ecology==
===Feeding===
Within the cichlid family, carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, planktivores, and detritivores are known, meaning the Cichlidae encompass essentially the full range of food consumption possible in the animal kingdom. Various species have morphological adaptations for specific food sources, but most cichlids consume a wider variety of foods based on availability. 
Carnivorous cichlids can be further divided into piscivorous and molluscivorous, since the morphology and hunting behavior differ greatly between the two categories. Piscivorous cichlids eat other fish, fry, larvae, and eggs. Some species eat the offspring of mouthbrooders by head-ramming, wherein the hunter shoves its head into the mouth of a female to expel her young and eat them. Molluscivorous cichlids have several hunting strategies amongst the varieties within the group. Lake Malawi cichlids consume substrate and filter it out through their gill rakers to eat the mollusks that were in the substrate. Gill rakers are finger-like structures that line the gills of some fish to catch any food that might escape through their gills.
Many cichlids are primarily herbivores, feeding on algae (e.g. &quot;Petrochromis&quot;) and plants (e.g. &quot;Etroplus suratensis&quot;). Small animals, particularly invertebrates, are only a minor part of their diets.

Other cichlids are detritivores and eat organic material, called &quot;Aufwuchs&quot; (offal); among these species are the tilapiines of the genera &quot;Oreochromis&quot;, &quot;Sarotherodon&quot;, and &quot;Tilapia&quot;.

Other cichlids are predatory and eat little or no plant matter. These include generalists that catch a variety of small animals, including other fishes and insect larvae (e.g. &quot;Pterophyllum&quot;), as well as variety of specialists. &quot;Trematocranus&quot; is a specialized snail-eater, while &quot;Pungu maclareni&quot; feeds on sponges. A number of cichlids feed on other fish, either entirely or in part. &quot;Crenicichla&quot; species are stealth predators that lunge from concealment at passing small fish, while &quot;Rhamphochromis&quot; species are open-water pursuit predators that chase down their prey. Paedophagous cichlids such as the &quot;Caprichromis&quot; species eat other species&#x27; eggs or young, in some cases ramming the heads of mouthbrooding species to force them to disgorge their young. Among the more unusual feeding strategies are those of &quot;Corematodus&quot;, &quot;Docimodus evelynae&quot;, &quot;Plecodus&quot;, &quot;Perissodus&quot;, and &quot;Genyochromis&quot; spp., which feed on scales and fins of other fishes, a behavior known as lepidophagy, along with the death-mimicking behaviour of &quot;Nimbochromis&quot; and &quot;Parachromis&quot; species, which lay motionless, luring small fish to their side prior to ambush.

This variety of feeding styles has helped cichlids to inhabit similarly varied habitats. Its pharyngeal teeth (in the throat) afford cichlids so many &quot;niche&quot; feeding strategies, because the jaws pick and hold food, while the pharyngeal teeth crush the prey.

==Behavior==

=== Aggression ===
Aggressive behavior in cichlids is ritualized and consists of multiple displays used to seek confrontation while being involved in evaluation of competitors, coinciding with temporal proximity to mating. Displays of ritualized aggression in cichlids include a remarkably rapid change in coloration, during which a successfully dominant territorial male assumes a more vivid and brighter coloration, while a subordinate or &quot;nonterritorial&quot; male assumes a dull-pale coloration. In addition to color displays, cichlids employ their lateral lines to sense movements of water around their opponents to evaluate the competing male for physical traits/fitness. Male cichlids are very territorial due to the pressure of reproduction, and establish their territory and social status by physically driving out challenging males (novel intruders) through lateral displays (parallel orientation, uncovering gills), biting, or mouth fights (head-on collisions of open mouths, measuring jaw sizes, and biting each other&#x27;s jaws). The cichlid social dichotomy is composed of a single dominant with multiple subordinates, where the physical aggression of males becomes a contest for resources (mates, territory, food). Female cichlids prefer to mate with a successfully alpha male with vivid coloration, whose territory has food readily available.

===Mating===
Cichlids mate either monogamously or polygamously. The mating system of a given cichlid species is not consistently associated with its brooding system. For example, although most monogamous cichlids are not mouthbrooders, &quot;Chromidotilapia&quot;, &quot;Gymnogeophagus&quot;, &quot;Spathodus&quot;, and &quot;Tanganicodus&quot; all include – or consist entirely of – monogamous mouthbrooders. In contrast, numerous open- or cave-spawning cichlids are polygamous; examples include many &quot;Apistogramma&quot;, &quot;Lamprologus&quot;, &quot;Nannacara&quot;, and &quot;Pelvicachromis&quot; species.

Most adult male cichlids, specifically in the cichlid tribe Haplochromini, exhibit a unique pattern of oval-shaped color dots on their anal fins. These phenomena, known as egg spots, aid in the mouthbrooding mechanisms of cichlids. The egg spots consist of carotenoid-based pigment cells, which indicate a high cost to the organism, when considering that fish are not able to synthesize their own carotenoids.

The mimicry of egg spots is used by males for the fertilization process. Mouthbrooding females lay eggs and immediately snatch them up with their mouths. Over millions of years, male cichlids have evolved egg spots to initiate the fertilization process more efficiently. When the females are snatching up the eggs into their mouth, the males gyrate their anal fins, which illuminates the egg spots on his tail. Afterwards, the female, believing these are her eggs, places her mouth to the anal fin (specifically the genital papilla) of the male, which is when he discharges sperm into her mouth and fertilizes the eggs.

The genuine color of egg spots is a yellow, red, or orange inner circle with a colorless ring surrounding the shape. Through phylogenetic analysis, using the mitochondrial &quot;ND2&quot; gene, the true egg spots are thought to have evolved in the common ancestor of the &quot;Astatoreochromis&quot; lineage and the modern &quot;Haplochrominis&quot; species. This ancestor was most likely riverine in origin, based on the most parsimonious representation of habitat type in the cichlid family. The presence of egg spots in a turbid riverine environment would seem particularly beneficial and necessary for intraspecies communication.

Two pigmentation genes are found to be associated with egg-spot patterning and color arrangement. These are &quot;fhl2-a&quot; and &quot;fhl2-b&quot;, which are paralogs. These genes aid in pattern formation and cell-fate determination in early embryonic development. The highest expression of these genes was temporally correlated with egg-spot formation. A short, interspersed, repetitive element was also seen to be associated with egg spots. Specifically, it was evident upstream of the transcriptional start site of &quot;fhl2&quot; in only &quot;Haplochrominis&quot; species with egg spots

===Self-fertilization===
The cichlid &quot;Benitochromis nigrodorsalis&quot; from Western Africa ordinarily undergoes biparental reproduction, but is also able to undergo facultative (optional) selfing (self-fertilization). Facultative selfing may be an adaptive option when a mating partner is unavailable.

===Brood care===
====Pit spawning in cichlids====
Pit spawning, also referred to as substrate breeding, is a behavior in cichlid fish in which a fish builds a pit in the sand or ground, where a pair court and consequently spawn. Many different factors go into this behavior of pit spawning, including female choice of the male and pit size, as well as the male defense of the pits once they are dug in the sand.

Cichlids are often divided into two main groups: mouthbrooders and substrate brooders. Different parenting investment levels and behaviors are associated with each type of reproduction. As pit spawning is a reproductive behavior, many different physiological changes occur in the cichlid while this process is occurring that interfere with social interaction. Different kinds of species that pit spawn, and many different morphological changes occur because of this behavioral experience.

Pit spawning is an evolved behavior across the cichlid group. Phylogenetic evidence from cichlids in Lake Tanganyika could be helpful in uncovering the evolution of their reproductive behaviors. Several important behaviors are associated with pit spawning, including parental care, food provisioning, and brood guarding.

====Mouth brooding vs. pit spawning====
One of the differences studied in African cichlids is reproductive behavior. Some species pit spawn and some are known as mouth brooders. Mouthbrooding is a reproductive technique where the fish scoop up eggs and fry for protection. While this behavior differs from species to species in the details, the general basis of the behavior is the same. Mouthbrooding also affects how they choose their mates and breeding grounds. In a 1995 study, Nelson found that in pit-spawning females choose males for mating based on the size of the pit that they dig, as well as some of the physical characteristics seen in the males. Pit spawning also differs from mouth brooding in the size and postnatal care exhibited. Eggs that have been hatched from pit-spawning cichlids are usually smaller than those of mouthbrooders. Pit-spawners&#x27; eggs are usually around 2 mm, while mouthbrooders are typically around 7 mm. While different behaviors take place postnatally between mouthbrooders and pit spawners, some similarities exist. Females in both mouthbrooders and pit-spawning cichlids take care of their young after they are hatched. In some cases, both parents exhibit care, but the female always cares for the eggs and newly hatched fry.

====Pit spawning process====

Many species of cichlids use pit spawning, but one of the less commonly studied species that exhibits this behavior is the Neotropical &quot;Cichlasoma dimerus&quot;. This fish is a substrate breeder that displays biparental care after the fry have hatched from their eggs. One study examined reproductive and social behaviors of this species to see how they accomplished their pit spawning, including different physiological factors such as hormone levels, color changes, and plasma cortisol levels. The entire spawning process could take about 90 minutes and 400~800 eggs could be laid. The female deposits about 10 eggs at a time, attaching them to the spawning surface, which may be a pit constructed on the substrate or another surface. The number of eggs laid was correlated to the space available on the substrate. Once the eggs were attached, the male swam over the eggs and fertilized them. The parents would then dig pits in the sand, 10–20 cm wide and 5–10 cm deep, where larvae were transferred after hatching. Larvae began swimming 8 days after fertilization and parenting behaviors and some of the physiological factors measured changed.

====Color changes====
In the same study, color changes were present before and after the pit spawning occurred. For example, after the larvae were transferred and the pits were beginning to be protected, their fins turned a dark grey color. In another study, of the rainbow cichlid, &quot;Herotilapia multispinosa&quot;, color changes occurred throughout the spawning process. Before spawning, the rainbow cichlid was an olive color with grey bands. Once spawning behaviors started, the body and fins of the fish became a more golden color. When the eggs were finished being laid, the pelvic fin all the way back to the caudal fin turned to a darker color and blackened in both the males and the females.

====Pit sizes====
Females prefer a bigger pit size when choosing where to lay eggs. Differences are seen in the sizes of pits that created, as well as a change in the morphology of the pits. Evolutionary differences between species of fish may cause them to either create pits or castles when spawning. The differences were changes in the way that each species fed, their macrohabitats, and the abilities of their sensory systems.

====Evolution====
Cichlids are renowned for their recent, rapid evolutionary radiation, both across the entire clade and within different communities across separate habitats. Within their phylogeny, many parallel instances are seen of lineages evolving to the same trait and multiple cases of reversion to an ancestral trait.

The family Cichlidae arose between 80 and 100 million years ago within the order Perciformes (perch-like fishes). Cichlidae can be split into a few groups based on their geographic location: Madagascar, Indian, African, and Neotropical (or South American). The most famous and diverse group, the African cichlids, can be further split either into Eastern and Western varieties, or into groups depending on which lake the species is from: Lake Malawi, Lake Victoria, or Lake Tanganyika. Of these subgroups, the Madagascar and Indian cichlids are the most basal and least diverse.

Of the African cichlids, the West African or Lake Tanganyika cichlids are the most basal.
Cichlids&#x27; common ancestor is believed to have been a spit-spawning species. Both Madagascar and Indian cichlids retain this feature. However, of the African cichlids, all extant substrate brooding species originate solely from Lake Tanganyika. The ancestor of the Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria cichlids were mouthbrooders. Similarly, only around 30% of South American cichlids are thought to retain the ancestral substrate-brooding trait. Mouthbrooding is thought to have evolved individually up to 14 times, and a return to substrate brooding as many as three separate times between both African and Neotropical species.

====Associated behaviors====
Cichlids have a great variety of behaviors associated with substrate brooding, including courtship and parental care alongside the brooding and nest-building behaviors needed for pit spawning. Cichlids&#x27; behavior typically revolves around establishing and defending territories when not courting, brooding, or raising young. Encounters between males and males or females and females are agonistic, while an encounter between a male and female leads to courtship. Courtship in male cichlids follows the establishment of some form of territory, sometimes coupled with building a bower to attract mates. After this, males may attempt to attract female cichlids to their territories by a variety of lekking display strategies or otherwise seek out females of their species. However, cichlids, at the time of spawning, undergo a behavioral change such that they become less receptive to outside interactions. This is often coupled with some physiological change in appearance.

====Brood care====
Cichlids can have maternal, paternal, or biparental care. Maternal care is most common among mouthbrooders, but cichlids&#x27; common ancestor is thought to exhibit paternal-only care. Other individuals outside of the parents may also play a role in raising young; in the biparental daffodil cichlid (&quot;Neolamprologus pulcher&quot;), closely related satellite males, those males that surround other males&#x27; territories and attempt to mate with female cichlids in the area, help rear the primary males&#x27; offspring and their own.

A common form of brood care involves food provisioning. For example, females of lyretail cichlids (&quot;Neolamprologus modabu&quot;) dig at sandy substrate more to push nutritional detritus and zooplankton into the surrounding water. Adult of &quot; N. modabu&quot; perform this strategy to collect food for themselves, but dig more when offspring are present, likely to feed their fry. This substrate-disruption strategy is rather common and can also be seen in convict cichlids (&quot;Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum&quot;). Other cichlids have an ectothermal mucus that they grow and feed to their young, while still others chew and distribute caught food to offspring. These strategies, however, are less common in pit-spawning cichlids.
Cichlids have highly organized breeding activities. All species show some form of parental care for both eggs and larvae, often nurturing free-swimming young until they are weeks or months old.
Communal parental care, where multiple monogamous pairs care for a mixed school of young have also been observed in multiple cichlid species, including &quot;Amphilophus citrinellus&quot;, &quot;Etroplus suratensis&quot;, and &quot;Tilapia rendalli&quot;. Comparably, the fry of &quot;Neolamprologus brichardi&quot;, a species that commonly lives in large groups, are protected not only by the adults, but also by older juveniles from previous spawns. Several cichlids, including discus (&quot;Symphysodon&quot; spp.), some &quot;Amphilophus&quot; species, &quot;Etroplus&quot;, and &quot;Uaru&quot; species, feed their young with a skin secretion from mucous glands.

The species &quot;Neolamprologus pulcher&quot; uses a cooperative breeding system, in which one breeding pair has many helpers that are subordinate to the dominant breeders.

Parental care falls into one of four categories: substrate or open brooders, secretive cave brooders (also known as guarding speleophils), and at least two types of mouthbrooders, ovophile mouthbrooders and larvophile mouthbrooders.

====Open brooding====
Open- or substrate-brooding cichlids lay their eggs in the open, on rocks, leaves, or logs. Examples of open-brooding cichlids include &quot;Pterophyllum&quot; and &quot;Symphysodon&quot; species and &quot;Anomalochromis thomasi&quot;. Male and female parents usually engage in differing brooding roles. Most commonly, the male patrols the pair&#x27;s territory and repels intruders, while the female fans water over the eggs, removing the infertile ones, and leading the fry while foraging. Both sexes are able to perform the full range of parenting behaviours.

====Cave brooding====

Secretive cave-spawning cichlids lay their eggs in caves, crevices, holes, or discarded mollusc shells, frequently attaching the eggs to the roof of the chamber. Examples include &quot;Pelvicachromis&quot; spp., &quot;Archocentrus&quot; spp., and &quot;Apistogramma&quot; spp. Free-swimming fry and parents communicate in captivity and in the wild. Frequently, this communication is based on body movements, such as shaking and pelvic fin flicking. In addition, open- and cave-brooding parents assist in finding food resources for their fry. Multiple neotropical cichlid species perform leaf-turning and fin-digging behaviors.

====Ovophile mouthbrooding====
Ovophile mouthbrooders incubate their eggs in their mouths as soon as they are laid, and frequently mouthbrood free-swimming fry for several weeks. Examples include many East African Rift lakes (Lake Malawi, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Victoria) endemics, e.g.: &quot;Maylandia&quot;, &quot;Pseudotropheus&quot;, &quot;Tropheus&quot;, and &quot;Astatotilapia burtoni&quot;, along with some South American cichlids such as &quot;Geophagus steindachneri&quot;.

====Larvophile mouthbrooding====
Larvophile mouthbrooders lay eggs in the open or in a cave and take the hatched larvae into the mouth. Examples include some variants of &quot;Geophagus altifrons&quot;, and some &quot;Aequidens&quot;, &quot;Gymnogeophagus&quot;, and &quot;Satanoperca&quot;, as well as &quot;Oreochromis mossambicus&quot; and &quot;Oreochromis niloticus&quot;. Mouthbrooders, whether of eggs or larvae, are predominantly females. Exceptions that also involve the males include eretmodine cichlids (genera &quot;Spathodus&quot;, &quot;Eretmodus&quot;, and &quot;Tanganicodus&quot;), some &quot;Sarotherodon&quot; species (such as &quot;Sarotherodon melanotheron&quot;), &quot;Chromidotilapia guentheri&quot;, and some &quot;Aequidens&quot; species. This method appears to have evolved independently in several groups of African cichlids.

==Speciation==

Cichlids provide scientists with a unique perspective of speciation, having become extremely diverse in the recent geological past, those of Lake Victoria actually within the last 10,000 to 15,000 years, a small fraction of the millions taken for Galápagos finch speciation in Darwin&#x27;s textbook case. Some of the contributing factors to their diversification are believed to be the various forms of prey processing displayed by cichlid pharyngeal jaw apparatuses. These different jaw apparatuses allow for a broad range of feeding strategies, including algae scraping, snail crushing, planktivory, piscivory, and insectivory. Some cichlids can also show phenotypic plasticity in their pharyngeal jaws, which can also help lead to speciation. In response to different diets or food scarcity, members of the same species can display different jaw morphologies that are better suited to different feeding strategies. As species members begin to concentrate around different food sources and continue their lifecycle, they most likely spawn with like individuals. This can reinforce the jaw morphology and given enough time, create new species. Such a process can happen through allopatric speciation, whereby species diverge according to different selection pressures in different geographical areas, or through sympatric speciation, by which new species evolve from a common ancestor while remaining in the same area. In Lake Apoyo in Nicaragua, &quot;Amphilophus zaliosus&quot; and its sister species &quot;Amphilophus citrinellus&quot; display many of the criteria needed for sympatric speciation. In the African rift lake system, cichlid species in numerous distinct lakes evolved from a shared hybrid swarm.

==Population status==
In 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature classified 184 species as vulnerable, 52 as endangered, and 106 as critically endangered.
At present, the IUCN only lists &quot;Yssichromis&quot; sp. nov. &quot;argens&quot; as extinct in the wild, and six species are listed as entirely extinct, but many more possibly belong in these categories (for example, &quot;Haplochromis aelocephalus&quot;, &quot;H. apogonoides&quot;, &quot;H. dentex&quot;, &quot;H. dichrourus&quot;, and numerous other members of the genus &quot;Haplochromis&quot; have not been seen since the 1980s, but are maintained as critically endangered on the small chance that tiny –but currently unknown– populations survive).

===Lake Victoria===

Because of the introduced Nile perch (&quot;Lates niloticus&quot;), Nile tilapia (&quot;Oreochromis niloticus&quot;), and water hyacinth, deforestation that led to water siltation, and overfishing, many Lake Victoria cichlid species have become extinct or been drastically reduced. By around 1980, lake fisheries yielded only 1% cichlids, a drastic decline from 80% in earlier years.

By far the largest Lake Victoria group is the haplochromine cichlids, with more than 500 species, but at least 200 of these (about 40%) have become extinct, and many others are seriously threatened. Initially it was feared that the percentage of extinct species was even higher, but some species have been rediscovered after the Nile perch started to decline in the 1990s. Some species have survived in nearby small satellite lakes, or in refugia among rocks or papyrus sedges (protecting them from the Nile perch), or have adapted to the human-induced changes in the lake itself. The species were often specialists and these were not affected to the same extent. For example, the piscivorous haplochromines were particularly hard hit with a high number of extinctions, while the zooplanktivorous haplochromines reached densities in 2001 that were similar to before the drastic decline, although consisting of fewer species and with some changes in their ecology.

==Food and game fish==
Although cichlids are mostly small- to medium-sized, many are notable as food and game fishes. With few thick rib bones and tasty flesh, artisan fishing is not uncommon in Central America and South America, as well as areas surrounding the African rift lakes.

===Tilapia===
The most important food cichlids, however, are the tilapiines of North Africa. Fast growing, tolerant of stocking density, and adaptable, tilapiine species have been introduced and farmed extensively in many parts of Asia and are increasingly common aquaculture targets elsewhere.

Farmed tilapia production is about annually, with an estimated value of US$1.8 billion, about equal to that of salmon and trout.

Unlike those carnivorous fish, tilapia can feed on algae or any plant-based food. This reduces the cost of tilapia farming, reduces fishing pressure on prey species, avoids concentrating toxins that accumulate at higher levels of the food chain, and makes tilapia the preferred &quot;aquatic chickens&quot; of the trade.

===Game fish===
Many large cichlids are popular game fish. The peacock bass (&quot;Cichla&quot; species) of South America is one of the most popular sportfish. It was introduced in many waters around the world. In Florida, this fish generates millions of hours of fishing and sportfishing revenue of more than US$8 million a year. Other cichlids preferred by anglers include the oscar, Mayan cichlid (&quot;Cichlasoma urophthalmus&quot;), and jaguar cichlid (&quot;Parachromis managuensis&quot;).

==Aquarium fish==
Since 1945, cichlids have become increasingly popular as aquarium fish.

The most common species in hobbyist aquaria is &quot;Pterophyllum scalare&quot; from the Amazon River basin in tropical South America, known in the trade as the &quot;angelfish&quot;. Other popular or readily available species include the oscar (&quot;Astronotus ocellatus&quot;), convict cichlid (&quot;Archocentrus nigrofasciatus&quot;) and discus fish (&quot;Symphysodon&quot;).
==Hybrids and selective breeding==

Some cichlids readily hybridize with related species, both in the wild and under artificial conditions. Other groups of fishes, such as European cyprinids, also hybridize. Unusually, cichlid hybrids have been put to extensive commercial use, in particular for aquaculture and aquaria. The hybrid red strain of tilapia, for example, is often preferred in aquaculture for its rapid growth. Tilapia hybridization can produce all-male populations to control stock density or prevent reproduction in ponds.

===Aquarium hybrids===
The most common aquarium hybrid is perhaps the blood parrot cichlid, which is a cross of several species, especially from species in the genus &quot;Amphilophus&quot;. (There are many hypotheses, but the most likely is: &quot;Amphilophus labiatus&quot; × &quot;Vieja synspillus&quot; With a triangular-shaped mouth, an abnormal spine, and an occasionally missing caudal fin (known as the &quot;love heart&quot; parrot cichlid), the fish is controversial among aquarists. Some have called blood parrot cichlids &quot;the Frankenstein monster of the fish world&quot;. Another notable hybrid, the flowerhorn cichlid, was very popular in some parts of Asia from 2001 until late 2003, and is believed to bring good luck to its owner. The popularity of the flowerhorn cichlid declined in 2004. Owners released many specimens into the rivers and canals of Malaysia and Singapore, where they threaten endemic communities.

Numerous cichlid species have been selectively bred to develop ornamental aquarium strains. The most intensive programs have involved angelfish and discus, and many mutations that affect both coloration and fins are known. Other cichlids have been bred for albino, leucistic, and xanthistic pigment mutations, including oscars, convict cichlid and &quot;Pelvicachromis pulcher&quot;. Both dominant and recessive pigment mutations have been observed. In convict cichlids, for example, a leucistic coloration is recessively inherited, while in &quot;Oreochromis niloticus niloticus&quot;, red coloration is caused by a dominant inherited mutation.

This selective breeding may have unintended consequences. For example, hybrid strains of &quot;Mikrogeophagus ramirezi&quot; have health and fertility problems. Similarly, intentional inbreeding can cause physical abnormalities, such as the notched phenotype in angelfish.

==Genera==
The genus list is as per FishBase. Studies are continuing, however, on the members of this family, particularly the haplochromine cichlids of the African rift lakes.

<text>A governor is an administrative leader and head of a polity or political region, in some cases, such as governors-general, as the head of a state&#x27;s official representative. Depending on the type of political region or polity, a &quot;governor&quot; may be either appointed or elected, and the governor&#x27;s powers can vary significantly, depending on the public laws in place locally. The adjective pertaining to a governor is gubernatorial, from the Latin root &quot;gubernare&quot;. In a federated state, the governor may serve as head of state and head of government for their regional polity, while still operating under the laws of the federation, which has its own head of state for the entire federation.

==Ancient empires==
===Pre-Roman empires===
Though the legal and administrative framework of provinces, each administered by a governor, was created by the Romans, the term &quot;governor&quot; has been a convenient term for historians to describe similar systems in antiquity. Indeed, many regions of the pre-Roman antiquity were ultimately replaced by Roman &#x27;standardized&#x27; provincial governments after their conquest by Rome. Plato used the metaphor of turning the Ship of State with a rudder; the Latin word for rudder is gubernaculum.

===Egypt===
*In Pharaonic times, the governors of each of the various provinces in the kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt (called &quot;nomes&quot; by the Greeks, and whose names often alluded to local patterns of religious worship) are usually known by the Greek word.

===Pre- and Hellenistic satraps===
* Media and Achaemenid Persia introduced the satrapy, probably inspired by the Assyrian / Babylonian examples
* Alexander the Great and equally Hellenistic diadoch kingdoms, mainly Seleucids (greater Syria) and Lagids (&#x27;Ptolemies&#x27; in Hellenistic Egypt)
* in later Persia, again under Iranian dynasties:
** Parthia
** the Sassanid dynasty dispensed with the office after Shapur I (who had still 7 of them), replacing them with petty vassal rulers, known as &quot;shahdar&quot;s

===Ancient Rome===
From the creation of the earliest Roman subject provinces, a governor was appointed each year to administer each of them. The core function of a Roman governor was as a magistrate or judge, and the management of taxation and the public spending in their area.

Under the Republic and the early Empire, however, a governor also commanded military forces in his province. Republican governors were all men who had served in senior magistracies (the consulate or praetorship) in Rome in the previous year, and carried related titles as governor (&quot;proconsul&quot; or &quot;propraetor&quot;). The first emperor, Octavianus Augustus (who acquired or settled a number of new territories; officially his style was republican: Princeps civitatis), divided the provinces into two categories; the traditionally prestigious governorships remained as before (in what have become known as &quot;senatorial&quot; provinces), while in a range of others, he retained the formal governorship himself, delegating the actual task of administration to appointees (usually with the title &quot;legatus Augusti&quot;). The &quot;legatus&quot; sometimes would appoint a prefect (later procurator), usually a man of equestrian rank, to act as his deputy in a subregion of the larger province: the infamous character of Pontius Pilate in the Christian Gospels was a governor of this sort.

A special case was Egypt, a rich &#x27;private&#x27; domain and vital granary, where the emperor almost inherited the theocratic status of a pharaoh. The emperor was represented there by a governor &quot;sui generis&quot; styled &quot;praefectus augustalis&quot;, a title evoking the religious cult of the emperor.

Emperors Diocletian (see Tetrarchy) and Constantine in the third and fourth centuries AD carried out a root and branch reorganisation of the administration with two main features:

*Provinces were divided up and became much more numerous (Italy itself, before the &#x27;colonizing homeland&#x27;, was brought into the system for the first time); they were then grouped into dioceses, and the dioceses in turn into four praetorian prefectures (originally each under a residing co-emperor);
*Military responsibilities were removed from governors and given to new officials called &quot;comes rei militaris&quot; (the comital title was also granted to many court and civilian administrative positions) or &quot;dux&quot;, later also &quot;magister militum&quot;.

The prestigious governorships of Africa and Asia remained with the title proconsul, and the special right to refer matters directly to the emperor; the &quot;praefectus augustalis&quot; in Alexandria and the &quot;comes Orientis&quot; in Antioch also retained special titles. Otherwise, the governors of provinces had various titles, some known as &quot;consularis&quot;, some as &quot;corrector&quot;, while others as &quot;praeses&quot;. Apart from Egypt and the East (&quot;Oriens&quot; – &quot;viz&quot; greater Syria), each diocese was directed by a governor known as a &quot;vicarius&quot;. The prefectures were directed by &quot;praefecti praetorio&quot; (greatly transformed in their functions from their role in the early Empire).

===Byzantium===
This system survived with few significant changes until the collapse of the empire in the West, and in the East, the breakdown of order with the Persian and Arab invasions of the seventh century. At that stage, a new kind of governor emerged, the Strategos. It was a role leading the themes which replaced provinces at this point, involving a return to the amalgamation of civil and military office which had been the practice under the Republic and the early Empire.

===Legacy===
While the Roman administration in the West was largely destroyed in the barbarian invasions, its model was remembered; this model became very influential through two particular vehicles: Roman law and the Christian Church.

==Holy Roman/Habsburg Empires and successor states==
*Reichskommissar

==Turkish rule==
In the Ottoman Empire, all pashas (generals) administered a province of the Great Sultan&#x27;s vast empire, with specific titles (such as Mutessaryf; Vali or Wāli which was often maintained and revived in the oriental successor states; Beilerbei (rendered as &quot;governor-general&quot;, as he is appointed above several provinces under individual governors) and Dey)

==British Empire and Commonwealth realms==


In the British Empire, a governor was originally an official appointed by the British monarch (or the cabinet) to oversee a crown colony and was the (sometimes notional) head of the colonial administration. The governors&#x27; powers varied from colony to colony, depending on its constitutional setup; while all colonies had a separate court system, the governor only had legislative power in colonies that lacked a Legislative Council or Legislative Assembly. The executive powers vested in the governor varied as well; while many colonies had an Executive Council to help with the colony&#x27;s administration, these ranged from presidential cabinet-like bodies that only served as consultative forums without collective executive powers or functions of their own while the governor had an independent decision-making capacity, to fully fledged parliamentary ministries whose decisions the governor was required to formally execute.

Today, crown colonies of the United Kingdom continue to be administered by governors who hold varying degrees of power. Because of the different constitutional histories of the former colonies of the United Kingdom, the term &quot;governor&quot; now refers to officials with differing amounts of power.

Administrators, commissioners and high commissioners exercise similar powers to governors. (Note: such high commissioners are not to be confused with the high commissioners who are the equivalent of ambassadors between Commonwealth states).

Frequently the name &#x27;Government House&#x27; is given to governors&#x27; residences.

:The term can also be used in a more generic sense, especially for compound titles which include it: governor-general and lieutenant-governor.

===Vice-regal governors===

====United Kingdom overseas territories====
In the United Kingdom&#x27;s remaining overseas territories, the governor is normally a direct appointee of the British government and plays an active role in governing and lawmaking (though usually with the advice of elected local representatives). The governor&#x27;s chief responsibility is for the defence and external affairs of the colony.

In some minor overseas territories, instead of a governor, there is an administrator or commissioner, or the position is held &quot;ex officio&quot; by a High Commissioner.

==== Australia ====
In Australia, each state has the governor as its formal representative of the sovereign, as head of the state government. It is not a political office but a ceremonial one. Each state governor is appointed by the Australian monarch on the advice of the premier, who is the political chief executive of the state government (until 1986, state governors were appointed by the British monarch on the advice of the British government). State governors have emergency reserve powers but these are rarely used. The territories of Australia other than the ACT have administrators instead of governors, who are appointed formally by the governor-general. The governor-general is the representative of and appointed by the king of Australia sovereign at a federal level on the advice of the prime minister of Australia.

As with the governors-general of Australia and other Commonwealth realms, state governors usually exercise their power only on the advice of a government minister.

==== Canada ====
In Canada, there are governors at the federal and provincial levels of government who, within their jurisdictions, act as representatives of the king of Canada, who is Canada&#x27;s head of state. The federal governor is the governor general of Canada, and the governor of each province is the lieutenant governor. The governor general is appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the prime minister of Canada, whereas the lieutenant governors are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister. The role of the governor general and of the lieutenant governors in Canada is largely ceremonial, although they do retain the authority to exercise reserve powers in exceptional circumstances.

Each of the three territories is headed by a commissioner appointed by the federal Cabinet. Unlike provincial lieutenant governors, they are not representatives of the sovereign but rather are representatives of the federal government.

==== British Hong Kong (1841–1997) ====
In the colonial period of Hong Kong, the governor was the representative of the sovereign from 1843, which was the year that the authorities and duties of the post were officially defined by the Hong Kong Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, until the handover of Hong Kong to the PRC government in 1997. Each governor was appointed by the monarch and possessed significant powers such as the power of appointing lawmakers in the legislative council, the power to grant land, the power of veto over bills and motions, the power of pardon, etc. At the same time, the governor was also the head of the colonial cabinet, the chairman of the Executive Council, the president of the Legislative Council (until 1993), as well as the commander-in-chief of the British Forces in Hong Kong.

====New Zealand====
The governor-general of New Zealand is always the governor of the Ross Dependency, an Antarctic sector which is claimed by the Realm of New Zealand.

====Within the United Kingdom====
Within the United Kingdom itself, there was a position of Governor of Northern Ireland from 1922 until the suspension of the devolved Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1973.

====Within England====
From the 16th century until 1995, there was a governor of the Isle of Wight, part of England. Since the reign of Henry VIII, the monarch has borne the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England.

==Other colonial empires==
European powers other than the United Kingdom, with colonies in Asia, Africa and elsewhere, gave their top representatives in their colonies the title of governor. Those representatives could be from chartered companies that ruled the colonies. In some of these colonies, there are still officials called governors.

See:
*Danish colonial empire
*Dutch Empire
*Empire of Japan
*French colonial empire
*German colonial empire
*Italian Empire
*Portuguese Empire
*Spanish Empire
*Swedish overseas colonies

==Russia and former Soviet Union==
In the Russian Empire, the governorate (guberniya) and governorate-general were the main units of territorial and administrative subdivision since the reforms of Peter the Great. These were governed by a governor and governor-general respectively.

A special case was the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone, which was governed as a concession granted by Imperial China to the Russian &#x27;Chinese Eastern Railway Society&#x27; (in Russian &quot;Obshchestvo Kitayskoy Vostochnoy Zheleznoy Dorogi&quot;; established on 17 December 1896 in St. Petersburg, later moved to Vladivostok), which built 1,481 km of tracks (Tarskaya – Hilar – Harbin – Nikolsk-Ussuriski; 3 November 1901 traffic opened) and established on 16 May 1898 the new capital city, Harbin; in August 1898, the defense for Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) across northeast China was assumed by Russia (first under Priamur governor).

On July 1, 1903, the Chinese Eastern Railway was opened and given authority of its own CER Administration (Russian: &quot;Upravleniye KVZhD&quot;), vested in the Directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway, with the additional quality of Governors of the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone (in Harbin; as such being August 12, 1903 – July 1, 1905 subordinated to the imperial Viceroyalty of the Far East, see Lüshunkou). The post continued to function despite various political changes until after World War II.

Some of the administrative subdivisions of Russia are headed by governors, while others are headed by presidents or heads of administration. From 1991 to 2005, they were elected by popular vote and from 2005 to 2012, they were appointed by the federal president and confirmed by the province&#x27;s legislature. After the debate, conducted by State Duma in April 2012, the direct elections of governors were expected to be restored.

==Other European countries and empires==

===Austria===
A Landeshauptmann (German for &quot;state captain&quot; or &quot;state governor&quot;, literally &#x27;country headman&#x27;; plural &quot;Landeshauptleute&quot; or &quot;Landeshauptmänner&quot; as in Styria till 1861; &quot;Landeshauptfrau&quot; is the female form) is an official title in German for certain political offices equivalent to a governor. It has historical uses, both administrative and colonial, and is now used in federal Austria and in South Tyrol, a majority German-speaking province of Italy adjacent to Tyrol.

===Benelux monarchies===
* In the Netherlands, the government-appointed heads of the provinces were known as &quot;Gouverneur&quot; from 1814 until 1850, when their title was changed to &quot;King&#x27;s&quot; (or &quot;Queen&#x27;s&quot;) &quot;Commissioner&quot;. In the southern province of Limburg, however, the commissioner is still informally called &quot;Governor&quot;.
* In the Dutch crown&#x27;s Caribbean Overseas territories (Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten), the style governor is still used, alongside the political head of government.
* In Belgium, each of the ten provinces has a governor, appointed by the regional government. He represents not only the regional but also the federal government in the province. He controls the local governments and is responsible for law and order, security and emergency action. The national capital of Brussels, which is not part of a province, also has a governor with nearly the same competencies.

===France===
During the Ancien Régime in France, the representative of the king in his provinces and cities was the gouverneur. Royal officers were chosen from the highest nobility, and provincial and city governors (oversight of provinces and cities was frequently combined) were predominantly military positions in charge of defense and policing. Provincial governorsalso called &quot;lieutenant generals&quot;also had the ability to convoke provincial parlements, provincial estates and municipal bodies. The title &quot;gouverneur&quot; first appeared under Charles VI. The ordinance of Blois of 1579 reduced their number to 12, but an ordinance of 1779 increased their number to 39 (18 first-class governors, 21 second-class governors). Although in principle, they were the king&#x27;s representatives and their charges could be revoked at the king&#x27;s will, some governors had installed themselves and their heirs as a provincial dynasty. The governors were at the height of their power from the middle of the 16th to the middle of the 17th century, but their role in provincial unrest during the civil wars led Cardinal Richelieu to create the more tractable positions of intendants of finance, policing and justice, and in the 18th century the role of provincial governors was greatly curtailed.

===Germany===
Until 1933, the term &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; (state governor) was used in Prussia for the head of government of a province, In the modern-day states of Germany, the counterpart to &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; is the &quot;Ministerpräsident&quot; (minister-president). In the present German states of Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, and North Rhine-Westphalia there are – and earlier in more German states there were – sub-state administrative regions called in , which is sometimes translated into English as governorate. Thus its respective head, in , is also translated as governor.

===Greece===
Ioannis Kapodistrias was the first (and, with the exception of the short tenure of his younger brother Augustinos Kapodistrias, the only) head of state of Greece to bear the title of governor.

===Italy===
*The essentially maritime empire of the Venetian republic, comprising Terra Firma, other Adriatic (mainly Istria and Dalmatia) and further Mediterranean (mainly Greek) possessions, used different styles, such as &quot;(castelleno e) provveditore&quot; (&quot;generale&quot;) or &quot;baile&quot;.
*In the fascist regime there was the governor of the colonies of the Italian colonial empire.
*In today&#x27;s Italy, the official name of a head of a Regione (the Italian subnational entity) is &quot;Presidente della Giunta regionale&quot; (President of the regional executive council). Since 2000, when a constitutional reform decided the direct election of the president by the people, out of perceived analogy with the US equivalent, there has been a practice among journalists to call the official &quot;governatore/governatrice&quot; (governor), although other people would normally prefer to use &quot;presidente/presidentessa della Regione&quot; (Regional president) informally.
*In the various Italian provinces (former principalities and city-states) that became amalgamated as the Papal States, the Holy See exerted temporal power via its legates and delegates, including some cardinals
*Also in Avignon and the surrounding southern French Comtat Venaissin, the home of the popes during their &#x27;Babylonian exile&#x27;, and retained centuries after, but never incorporated into the Papal States, legates and vice-legates were appointed.
*The sovereign modern remnant of the formerly large Papal States, the tiny Vatican City State, is now a mere enclave in Rome, the capital of Italian Republic. As it is too small to have further administrative-territorial divisions, it is the equivalent of a prime minister, governor and mayor all rolled into one post, styled the Governor of Vatican City.

==Other modern Asian countries==

===China===

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the title &quot;Governor&quot; () refers to the highest ranking executive of a provincial government. The governor is usually placed second in the provincial power hierarchy, below the secretary of the provincial Chinese Communist Party (CCP) committee (省委书记), who serves as the highest ranking party official in the province. Governors are elected by the provincial congresses and approved by the provincial party chief. All governors are not locals in the provinces which they govern.

The title can be also used while referring to a county governor (县长).

===India===

In India, each state has a ceremonial governor appointed by the president of India. These governors are different from the governors who controlled the British-controlled portions of the Indian Empire (as opposed to the princely states) prior to 1947.

A governor is the head of a state in India. Generally, a governor is appointed for each state, but after the 7th Constitutional Amendment, of 1956, one governor can be appointed for more than one state.

===Indonesia===

In Indonesia, the title &quot;gubernur&quot; refers to the highest-ranking executive of a provincial government. The governor and the vice governor are elected by a direct vote from the people as a couple candidate, so the governor is responsible to the provincial residents. The governor has a term of five years to work in office and can be re-elected for another single period. In case of death, disability, or resignation, the vice governor would stand in as acting governor for some time before being inaugurated as the permanent governor.

The elected governor is inaugurated by the president, or by the Indonesian minister of home affairs on behalf of the president. In addition, the governor is the representative of the central government in the province and is responsible to the president. The governor&#x27;s authority is regulated within Law () No. 32/2004 and Governmental Ordinance () No. 19/2010.

Principally, the governor has the tasks and the authorities to lead governmental services in the province, based upon the policies that have been made together with the provincial parliament. The governor is not the superordinate of regents or mayors, but only guides supervises, and coordinates the works of city/municipal and regency governments. In other parts, municipal and regency governments have the right to manage each governance affairs based on the autonomy principle and assistantship duties.

===Japan===

In Japan, the title refers to the highest ranking executive of a prefectural government. The governor was elected by a direct vote from the people and had a fixed term of four years. There is no restriction on the number of terms a person may serve as governor. The governor holds considerable power within the prefecture, including the ability to veto ordinances that have been passed by the prefecture assembly, as well as control of the prefecture&#x27;s budget and the power to dissolve the prefecture assembly. The governor can be subjected to a recall referendum. A total of one to four vice governors are appointed by the governor with the approval of the assembly. In the case of the governor&#x27;s death, disability, or resignation, a vice governor would stand in as governor or acting governor.

See List of governors of Japan for a list of the current governors.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, each of the four non-monarchical states (Penang, Malacca, Sabah and Sarawak) has a ceremonial governor styled &quot;Yang di-Pertua Negeri&quot;, appointed to a renewable four-year term by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the federal King of Malaysia, on the advice of the prime minister after consulting the state governments. Each of these states has a separate head of government called the &quot;Ketua Menteri&quot; or chief minister. The four Yang di-Pertua Negeri are members of the Conference of Rulers; however, they cannot participate in the election of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, discussions related to the privileges of the Malay rulers and matters concerning the observance of Islam.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, each of the four provinces has a governor who is appointed by the president. The governor is the representative of the federal in their province and is the ceremonial head of the province whereas the chief minister is the head of the provincial government. The governor exercises powers similar to the president&#x27;s, in their respective province.

===Papua New Guinea===
In Papua New Guinea, the leaders of the provinces have been known as governors since August 1995. Previously they were called premiers.

=== Philippines ===

In the Philippines, the title &quot;Governor&quot; (&quot;Gobernador&quot; or &quot;Punong Lalawigan&quot; in Filipino) refers to the highest-ranking executive of a province. The governor is elected by a direct vote from the people and has a fixed term of three years. A governor can serve only up to a maximum of three consecutive terms. He may however be suspended by either the ombudsman or the president, through the secretary of the interior and local government. He may be removed by the president if found guilty of an administrative case or a criminal act during his tenure. He may be subjected to a recall vote, but unlike a referendum, the voters elect the governor of their choice. In case of death, disability, resignation, forced removal, or suspension, the vice governor, elected separately in the same election for governor, succeeds as governor, or acting governor, as the case may be.

During both the Spanish and American colonial periods, as well as during the Japanese occupation of World War II, the chief executive of the Philippines was the governor-general of the Philippines.

The highest ranking executive of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was called &quot;regional governor&quot;. The regional governor is elected every three years, separately from a regional vice governor who replaces the regional governor if the latter vacates the position. Bangsamoro, its replacement, has the wa&#x27;lī (Arabic for &quot;governor&quot;) as its head of the region and is elected by parliament for a six-year term.

===Sri Lanka===
The provincial councils of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka are headed by governors, as representatives of the president. Prior to 1948, in Ceylon (former name for Sri Lanka), the governor of Ceylon was the head of the British colony.

===Thailand===
In Thailand, the title &quot;Governor&quot; (ผู้ว่าราชการ &quot;Phuwa Ratcha Gaan&quot; in Thai) refers to the administrator of each Thai province, who is appointed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The only exception is the specially governed district of Bangkok, whose governor is elected by its population.

==Other modern countries in North America==

===United States=== 
In the United States, the title &quot;Governor&quot; refers to the head of each state or insular territory. Governors retain sovereign power over executive and judiciary, are subordinate to the president of the United States and laws provided by the enumerated powers section of the federal constitution, and serve as the political and ceremonial head of the state. Nearly three-fourths of the states (36) hold gubernatorial elections in the same years as midterm elections (two years offset from presidential elections). Eleven states hold them in the same years as presidential elections (Vermont and New Hampshire hold elections every two years in every even-numbered year), while the remaining five hold them in odd-numbered years (two in the year after a presidential election, three in the year before).

In colonial North America, governors were chosen in a variety of ways, depending on how the colony was organized. In the crown colonies of Great Britain, France, and Spain, the governor was chosen by the ruling monarch of the colonizing power or his designees; in British colonies, the Board of Trade was often the primary decision maker. Colonies based on a corporate charter, such as the Connecticut Colony and the Massachusetts Bay Colony, elected their own governors based on rules spelt out in the charter or other colonial legislation. In proprietary colonies, such as the Province of Carolina before it became a crown colony (and was divided into North and South), governors were chosen by the Lords Proprietor who controlled the colony. In the early years of the American Revolutionary War, eleven of the Thirteen Colonies evicted (with varying levels of violence) royal and proprietary governors. The other two colonies (Connecticut and Rhode Island) had corporate charters; Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull was governor before and during the war period, while in Rhode Island, Governor Joseph Wanton was removed from office in 1775 for failing to support the rebel war effort.

Before achieving statehood, many of the fifty states were territories. Administered by the federal government, they had governors who were appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate rather than elected by the resident population.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, &quot;governor&quot; refers to the elected leader of each of the nation&#x27;s thirty-one Free and Sovereign States with the official Spanish title being &quot;Gobernador&quot;. Mexican governors are directly elected by the citizens of each state for a six-year term and cannot be re-elected.

==Other modern countries in South America==

Many of the South American republics (such as Chile and Argentina) have provinces or states run by elected governors, with offices similar in nature to U.S. state governors.

===Brazil===

Until the 1930 Revolution, the heads of the Brazilian Provinces, now called States, were styled as (provincial/state) presidents (&quot;presidentes&quot;). From 1930 to 1945, they were styled either governors (&quot;governadores&quot;) or, when appointed by the federal government, intervenors (&quot;interventores&quot;). From 1945 on, they have only been called governors.

==Modern equivalents==
As a generic term, &quot;governor&quot; is used for various &#x27;equivalent&#x27; politician who are the head of a state or province, rendering other official titles such as:
*Minister
*Administrators

This also applies to non-western or antique culture

==Other meanings of the word==
The word &quot;governor&quot; refers to a member of &quot;confederation of governors&quot; of a &quot;private sector entity&quot; who is a shareholder and elected by all of the other shareholders of that private sector entity to be a member of &quot;confederation of governors&quot; at a private sector entity (&quot;for profit&quot; and &quot;non-profit&quot;).

<text>Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains, roots, beans, nuts, or seeds. Flours are used to make many different foods. Cereal flour, particularly wheat flour, is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures. Corn flour has been important in Mesoamerican cuisine since ancient times and remains a staple in the Americas. Rye flour is a constituent of bread in both Central Europe and Northern Europe.

Cereal flour consists either of the endosperm, germ, and bran together (whole-grain flour) or of the endosperm alone (refined flour). &quot;Meal&quot; is either differentiable from flour as having slightly coarser particle size (degree of comminution) or is synonymous with flour; the word is used both ways.

The CDC has cautioned not to eat raw flour doughs or batters. Raw flour can contain harmful bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot; and needs to be cooked like other foods.

Normal processing of flour from which the outer layers have been removed (white flour) removes nutrients. Such flours, and breads made from them, may be fortified by adding nutrients; this is required by law in the UK.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;flour&quot; is originally a variant of the word &quot;flower&quot;, and both words derive from the Old French &quot;fleur&quot; or &quot;flour&quot;, which had the literal meaning &quot;blossom&quot;, and a figurative meaning &quot;the finest&quot;. The phrase &quot;fleur de farine&quot; meant &quot;the finest part of the flour&quot;, since flour resulted from the elimination of coarse and unwanted matter from the grain during milling.

== History ==

Maize or corn flour has been important in Mesoamerican cuisine since ancient times and remains a staple in the Americas. Rye flour is a constituent of bread in central and northern Europe. Archaeological evidence for making flour (wheat seeds crushed between simple millstones) dates to at least 6000 BC. In 2018, archaeologists reported finding evidence of bread making at Shubayqa 1, a Natufian hunter-gatherer site more than 14,000 years old in northwest Jordan. The Romans were the first to grind seeds on cone mills. In 1786, at the beginning of the Industrial Era, the first steam-powered flour mill, Albion Mills, Southwark, was completed in London. In the 1930s, some flour began to be enriched with iron, niacin, thiamine and riboflavin. In the 1940s, mills started to enrich flour and folic acid was added to the list in the 1990s.

=== Degermed and heat-processed flour ===

An important problem of the Industrial Revolution was the preservation of flour. Transportation distances and a relatively slow distribution system collided with natural shelf life. The reason for the limited shelf life is the fatty acids of the germ, which react from the moment they are exposed to oxygen. This occurs when grain is milled; the fatty acids oxidize and flour starts to become rancid. Depending on climate and grain quality, this process takes six to nine months. In the late 19th century, this process was too short for an industrial production and distribution cycle. As vitamins, micronutrients and amino acids were completely or relatively unknown in the late 19th century, removing the germ was an effective solution. Without the germ, flour cannot become rancid. Degermed flour became standard. Degermation started in densely populated areas and took approximately one generation to reach the countryside.
Heat-processed flour is flour where the germ is first separated from the endosperm and bran, then processed with steam, dry heat or microwave and blended into flour again.

=== Production ===

Milling of flour is accomplished by grinding grain between stones or steel wheels. Today, &quot;stone-ground&quot; usually means that the grain has been ground in a mill in which a revolving stone wheel turns over a stationary stone wheel, vertically or horizontally with the grain in between.

== Modern mills ==

Roller mills soon replaced stone grist mills as the production of flour has historically driven technological development, as attempts to make gristmills more productive and less labor-intensive led to the watermill and windmill. These terms are now applied more broadly to uses of water and wind power for purposes other than milling. More recently, the Unifine mill, an impact-type mill, was developed in the mid-20th century.

Modern farm equipment allows livestock farmers to do some or all of their own milling when it comes time to convert their own grain crops to coarse meal for livestock feed. This capability is economically important because the profit margins are often thin enough in commercial farming that saving expenses is vital to staying in business.

== Composition ==

Flour contains a high proportion of starches, which are a subset of complex carbohydrates also known as polysaccharides. The kinds of flour used in cooking include all-purpose flour (known as plain outside North America), self-rising flour, and cake flour (including bleached flour). The higher the protein content the harder and stronger the flour, and the more it will produce crispy or chewy breads. The lower the protein the softer the flour, which is better for cakes, cookies, and pie crusts. Cereal flour consists either of the endosperm, germ, and bran together (whole-grain flour) or of the endosperm alone (refined flour).

=== Bleached flour ===

&quot;Bleached flour&quot; is &quot;refined&quot; flour with a chemical whitening (bleaching) agent added. &quot;Refined&quot; flour has had the germ and bran, containing much of the nutritional fibre and vitamins, removed and is often referred to as &quot;white flour&quot;.

Bleached flour is artificially aged using a &quot;bleaching&quot; agent, a &quot;maturing&quot; agent, or both. A bleaching agent affects the carotenoids responsible for the natural colour of the flour; a &quot;maturing&quot; agent also affects gluten development. A maturing agent may either strengthen or weaken gluten development.

==== Additives ====
The four most common additives used as bleaching/maturing agents in the US are:
* Potassium bromate, listed as an ingredient, is a maturing agent that strengthens gluten development. It does not bleach.
* Benzoyl peroxide bleaches, but does not act as a maturing agent. It has no effect on gluten.
* Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is listed as an ingredient, either as an indication that the flour was matured using ascorbic acid or that a small amount is added as a dough enhancer. It is a maturing agent that strengthens gluten development, but does not bleach.
* Chlorine gas is used as both a bleaching agent and a maturing agent. It weakens gluten development and oxidizes starches, making it easier for the flour to absorb water and swell, resulting in thicker batters and stiffer doughs. The retarded gluten formation is desirable in cakes, cookies, and biscuits, as it would otherwise make them tougher and bread-like. The modification of starches in the flour allows the use of wetter doughs (making for a moister end product) without destroying the structure necessary for light, fluffy cakes and biscuits. Chlorinated flour allows cakes and other baked goods to set faster and rise better, and the fat to be distributed more evenly, with less vulnerability to collapse.

Some other chemicals used as flour treatment agents to modify color and baking properties include:
* Chlorine dioxide (unstable to be transported in the U.S.)
* Calcium peroxide
* Azodicarbonamide or azobisformamide (synthetic)
* Atmospheric oxygen causes natural bleaching.

Common preservatives in commercial flour include:
* Calcium propanoate
* Sodium benzoate
* Tricalcium phosphate
* Butylated hydroxyanisole

==== Frequency of additives ====

All bleaching and maturing agents (with the possible exception of ascorbic acid) have been banned in the United Kingdom.

Bromination of flour in the US has fallen out of favor, and while it is not yet actually banned anywhere, few retail flours available to the home baker are bromated anymore.

Many varieties of flour packaged specifically for commercial bakeries are still bromated. Retail bleached flour marketed to the home baker is now treated mostly with either peroxidation or chlorine gas. Current information from Pillsbury is that their varieties of bleached flour are treated both with benzoyl peroxide and chlorine gas. Gold Medal states that their bleached flour is treated either with benzoyl peroxide or chlorine gas, but no way exists to tell which process has been used when buying the flour at the grocery store.

====Old method of bleaching====
The old method of procuring white or &quot;bleached&quot; flour did not entail the use of chemical agents at all. Rather, the wheat kernels were moistened with water long enough for the outer kernels of the wheat which contained the bran to soften and, eventually, fall off while grinding. In some places, the leaves of Syrian rue (&quot;Peganum harmala&quot;) were spread in stratified layers between the layers of grain, and left in such a state for several days, until the fumes emitted from the astringent leaves of the plant caused the outer kernels of the wheat to break down and dissolve, leaving a clean and white flour after grinding.

=== Enriched flour ===

During the process of making flour, specifically as a result of the bleaching process, nutrients are lost. Some of these nutrients may be replaced during refining – the result is known as &quot;enriched&quot; flour. In the UK most flour, and consequently breads made with it, is required to be fortified with added calcium, iron, thiamine (Vitamin B1) and niacin (Vitamin B3); wholemeal flour is exempt as it inherently contains sufficient of these nutrients.

=== Cake flour ===
Cake flour is the lowest in gluten protein content, with 6–7% (5–8% from second source) protein to produce minimal binding so the cake &quot;crumbles&quot; easily.

=== Pastry flour ===
Pastry flour has the second-lowest gluten protein content, with 7.5–9.5% (8–9% from second source) protein to hold together with a bit more strength than cakes, but still produce flaky crusts rather than hard or crispy ones.

=== Plain or all-purpose flour ===
All-purpose, or &quot;AP flour&quot;, or plain flour is medium in gluten protein content at 9.5–11.5% (10–12% from second source) protein content. It has adequate protein content for many bread and pizza bases, though bread flour and special 00 grade Italian flour are often preferred for these purposes, respectively, especially by artisan bakers. Some biscuits are also prepared using this type of flour. &quot;Plain&quot; refers not only to AP flour&#x27;s middling gluten content but also to its lack of any added leavening agent (as in self-rising flour).

=== Bread flour ===
Bread flour is typically made from hard red winter wheat planted in the fall and harvested in the spring. Hard wheat is high in gluten, a protein that makes dough stretchy. Hard wheat is 11.5–13.5% (12–14% from second source) protein. The increased protein binds to the flour to entrap carbon dioxide released by the yeast fermentation process, resulting in a better rise and chewier texture.

=== Hard flour ===
Hard is a general term for flours with high gluten protein content, commonly refers to extra strong flour, with 13.5–16% (or 14–15% from some sources) protein (16% is a theoretically possible protein content). This flour may be used where a recipe adds ingredients that require the dough to be extra strong to hold together in their presence, or when strength is needed for constructions of bread (e.g., some centerpiece displays).

=== Gluten flour ===
Gluten flour is refined gluten protein, or a theoretical 100% protein (though practical refining never achieves a full 100%). It is used to strengthen flour as needed. For example, adding approximately one teaspoon per cup of AP flour gives the resulting mix the protein content of bread flour. It is commonly added to whole grain flour recipes to overcome the tendency of greater fiber content to interfere with gluten development, needed to give the bread better rising (gas holding) qualities and chew.

=== Unbleached flour ===
Unbleached flour is simply flour that has not undergone bleaching and therefore does not have the color of &quot;white&quot; flour. An example is graham flour, whose namesake, Sylvester Graham, was against using bleaching agents, which he considered unhealthy.

=== Self-raising flour ===
In English-speaking countries, self-raising (or self-rising) flour is commercially available with chemical leavening agents already in the mix. In America, it is also likely to be pre-salted; in Britain this is not the case. The added ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the flour, which aids a consistent rise in baked goods. This flour is generally used for preparing sponge cakes, scones, muffins, etc. It was invented by Henry Jones and patented in 1845. If a recipe calls for self-raising flour, and this is not available, the following substitution is possible:
* 1 cup (125 g) plain flour
* 1 teaspoon (3 g) baking powder
* (US recipes) a pinch to teaspoon (1 g or less) salt

== Types ==

=== Gluten-containing flours ===

==== Wheat flour ====

Wheat is the grain most commonly used to make flour. Certain varieties may be referred to as &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;white&quot;. Flours contain differing levels of the protein gluten. &quot;Strong flour&quot; or &quot;hard flour&quot; has a higher gluten content than &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;soft&quot; flour. &quot;Brown&quot; and wholemeal flours may be made of hard or soft wheat.
* Atta flour is a whole-grain wheat flour important in Indian and Pakistani cuisine, used for a range of breads such as roti and chapati. It is usually stone-ground to coarse granules, which gives it a texture not easily found in other flatbreads.
* Common wheat flour (&quot;T. aestivum&quot;) is the flour most often used for making bread. Durum wheat flour (&quot;T. durum&quot;) is the second most used.
* Maida flour is a finely milled wheat flour used to make a wide variety of Indian breads such as paratha and naan. Maida is widely used not only in Indian cuisine but also in Central Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine. Though sometimes referred to as &quot;all-purpose flour&quot; by Indian chefs, it more closely resembles cake flour or even pure starch. In India, maida flour is used to make pastries and other bakery items such as bread, biscuits and toast.
* Noodle flour is a special blend of flour used for the making of Asian-style noodles, made from wheat or rice.
* Semolina is the coarse, purified wheat middlings of durum wheat used in making pasta, breakfast cereals, puddings, and couscous.
* Spelt, an ancient grain, is a hexaploid species of wheat. Spelt dough needs less kneading than common wheat or durum wheat dough. Compared to hard-wheat flours, spelt flour has a relatively low (six to nine percent) protein count, just a little higher than pastry flour. That means that plain spelt flour works well in creating dough for soft foods such as cookies or pancakes. Crackers turn out well because they are made from dough that does not need to rise when baked.

==== Other varieties ====

* Rye flour is used to bake the traditional sourdough breads of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Russia, Czech Republic, Poland and Scandinavia. Most rye breads use a mix of rye and wheat flours because rye does not produce sufficient gluten. Pumpernickel bread is usually made exclusively of rye, and contains a mixture of rye flour and rye meal. Secale flower is used to make bread such as Prądnik bread.

=== Gluten-free flours ===
When flours do not contain gluten, they are suitable for people with gluten-related disorders, such as coeliac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy sufferers, among others. Contamination with gluten-containing cereals can occur during grain harvesting, transporting, milling, storing, processing, handling and/or cooking.
* Acorn flour is made from ground acorns and can be used as a substitute for wheat flour. It was used by Native Americans. Koreans also use acorn flour to make dotorimuk.
* Almond flour is made from ground almonds.
* Amaranth flour is a flour produced from ground amaranth grain. It was commonly used in pre-Columbian meso-American cuisine and was originally cultivated by the Aztecs. It is becoming more and more available in speciality food shops.
* Apple flour is made from milling apple pomace, the solid remains of juiced apples.
* Banana flour has been traditionally made of green bananas for thousands of years and is currently popular both as a gluten-free replacement for wheat flour and as a source of resistant starch.
* Bean flour is a flour produced from pulverized dried or ripe beans. Garbanzo and fava bean flour is a flour mixture with a high nutritional value and strong aftertaste.
* Brown rice flour is of great importance in Southeast Asian cuisine. Edible rice paper can be made from it.
* Buckwheat flour is used as an ingredient in many pancakes in the United States. In Japan, it is used to make a popular noodle called soba. In Russia, buckwheat flour is added to the batter for pancakes called &quot;blinis&quot; which are frequently eaten with caviar. Buckwheat flour is also used to make crêpes bretonnes in Brittany. On Hindu fasting days (&quot;Navaratri&quot; mainly, also &quot;Maha Shivaratri&quot;), people eat food made with buckwheat flour. The preparation varies across India. The most famous dishes are &quot;kuttu ki puri&quot; and &quot;kuttu pakora&quot;. In most northern and western states the usual term is &quot;kuttu ka atta&quot;.
* Cassava flour is made from the root of the cassava plant. In a purified form (pure starch), it is called tapioca flour (see in list below).
* Chestnut flour is popular in Corsica, the Périgord, and Lunigiana for breads, cakes and pastas. It is the original ingredient for polenta, still used as such in Corsica and other Mediterranean locations. Chestnut bread keeps fresh for as long as two weeks. In other parts of Italy it is mainly used for desserts.
* Chickpea flour (also known as gram flour or besan) is of great importance in Indian cuisine, and in Italy, where it is used for the Ligurian farinata.
* Chuño flour is made from dried potatoes in various countries of South America.
* Coconut flour is made from ground coconut meat and has the highest fiber content of any flour, having a very low concentration of digestible carbohydrates and thus making an excellent choice for those looking to restrict their carbohydrate intake. It also has a high fat content of about 60 percent.
* Finely ground maize, known as corn flour in the US, is popular in the Southern and Southwestern US, Mexico, Central America, and Punjab regions of India and Pakistan, where it is called &quot;makai ka atta&quot;. Coarse whole-grain corn flour is usually called cornmeal. Finely ground corn flour that has been treated with food-grade lime is called &quot;masa harina&quot; (see &quot;masa&quot;) and is used to make &quot;tortillas&quot; and &quot;tamales&quot; in Mexican cooking. In Britain &quot;cornflour&quot; is the term for what is known as corn starch in the US.
** Cornmeal is very similar to corn flour (see above) except in a coarser grind.
** Corn starch is starch extracted from endosperm of the corn kernel.
* Glutinous rice flour or sticky rice flour is used in east and southeast Asian cuisines for making tangyuan, etc.
* Hemp flour is produced by pressing the oil from the hemp seed and milling the residue. Hemp seed is approximately 30 percent oil and 70 percent residue. Hemp flour does not rise, and is best mixed with other flours. Added to any flour by about 15–20 percent, it gives a spongy nutty texture and flavor with a green hue.
* Mesquite flour is made from the dried and ground pods of the mesquite tree, which grows throughout North America in arid climates. The flour has a sweet, slightly nutty flavor and can be used in a wide variety of applications.
* Nut flours are grated from oily nuts—most commonly almonds and hazelnuts—and are used instead of or in addition to wheat flour to produce more dry and flavorful pastries and cakes. Cakes made with nut flours are usually called tortes and most originated in Central Europe, in countries such as Hungary and Austria.
* Peasemeal or pea flour is a flour produced from roasted and pulverized yellow field peas.
* Peanut flour made from shelled cooked peanuts is a high-protein alternative to regular flour.
* Potato starch flour is obtained by grinding the tubers to a pulp and removing the fibre and protein by water-washing. Potato starch (flour) is very white starch powder used as a thickening agent. Standard (native) potato starch needs boiling, to thicken in water, giving a transparent gel. Because the flour is made from neither grains nor legumes, it is used as a substitute for wheat flour in cooking by Jews during Passover, when grains are not eaten.
* Potato flour, often confused with potato starch, is a peeled, cooked potato powder of mashed, mostly drum-dried and ground potato flakes using the whole potato and thus containing the protein and some of the fibres of the potato. It has an off-white slight yellowish color. These dehydrated, dried, potatoes, also called instant mashed potatoes can also be granules or flakes. Potato flour is cold-water-soluble; however, it is not used often as it tends to be heavy.
* Rice flour is ground kernels of rice. It is a staple in Asia. It is also widely used in Western countries, especially for people who suffer from gluten-related disorders. Brown rice flour has higher nutritional value than white rice flour.
* Sorghum flour is made from grinding whole grains of the sorghum plant. It is called &quot;jowar&quot; in India.
* Tapioca flour, produced from the root of the cassava plant, is used to make breads, pancakes, tapioca pudding, a savoury porridge called fufu in Africa, and is used as a starch.
* Teff flour is made from the grain teff, and is of considerable importance in eastern Africa (particularly around the Horn of Africa). Notably, it is the chief ingredient in the bread injera, an important component of Ethiopian cuisine.

==== More types ====
Flour also can be made from soybeans, arrowroot, taro, cattails, manioc, quinoa, and other non-cereal foodstuffs.

=== Type numbers ===

In some markets, the different available flour varieties are labeled according to the ash mass that remains after a sample is incinerated in a laboratory oven (typically at or , see international standards ISO 2171 and ICC 104/1). This is an easily verified indicator for the fraction of the whole grain remains in the flour, because the mineral content of the starchy endosperm is much lower than that of the outer parts of the grain. Flour made from all parts of the grain (extraction rate: 100%) leaves about ash or more per dry flour. Plain white flour with an extraction rate of 50–60% leaves about .
* German flour type numbers () indicate the amount of ash (measured in milligrams) obtained from 100 g of the dry mass of this flour. Standard wheat flours (defined in DIN 10355) range from type 405 for normal white wheat flour for baking, to strong bread flour types 550, 812, and the darker types 1050 and 1600 for wholegrain breads.
* French flour type numbers () are a factor of 10 smaller than those used in Germany, because they indicate the ash content (in milligrams) per 10 g flour. Type 55 is the standard, hard-wheat white flour for baking, including puff pastries (). Type 45 is often called pastry flour, and is generally from a softer wheat (this corresponds to what older French texts call ). Some recipes use type 45 for croissants, for instance, although many French bakers use type 55 or a combination of types 45 and 55. Types 65, 80, and 110 are strong bread flours of increasing darkness, and type 150 is a wholemeal flour.
* Czech flour types describes roughness of milling instead of amount of ash, though sometimes a numbering system is used, it is not a rule. Czechs determine following four basic types of mill: extra soft wheat flour (, 00), soft wheat flour (, T650), fine wheat flour (), rough wheat flour () and farina wheat flour ()
* Argentine flour uses roughness of milling as well, being 0, 00, 000 and 0000, where the number of zeroes indicates its refinement.
* Polish flour type numbers, as is the case in Germany, indicate the amount of ash in 100 g of the dry mass of the flour. Standard wheat flours (defined by the PKN in PN-A-74022:2003) range from type 450 to 2000.

In the United States and the United Kingdom, no numbered standardized flour types are defined, and the ash mass is only rarely given on the label by flour manufacturers. However, the legally required standard nutrition label specifies the protein content of the flour, which is also a way for comparing the extraction rates of different available flour types.

In general, as the extraction rate of the flour increases, so do both the protein and the ash content. However, as the extraction rate approaches 100% (whole meal), the protein content drops slightly, while the ash content continues to rise.

The following table shows some typical examples of how protein and ash content relate to each other in wheat flour:

This table is only a rough guideline for converting bread recipes. Since flour types are not standardized in many countries, the numbers may differ between manufacturers. There is no French type corresponding to the lowest ash residue in the table. The closest is French Type 45.

There is no official Chinese name corresponding to the highest ash residue in the table. Usually such products are imported from Japan and the Japanese name &quot;zenryufun&quot; (全粒粉) is used, or it is called &quot;quánmài miànfěn&quot; (全麥麵粉).

It is possible to determine ash content from some US manufacturers. However, US measurements are based on wheat with a 14% moisture content. Thus, a US flour with 0.48% ash would approximate a French Type 55.

Other measurable properties of flour as used in baking can be determined using a variety of specialized instruments, such as the farinograph.

== Dangers ==

=== Flammability ===
Flour dust suspended in air is explosive—as is any mixture of a finely powdered flammable substance with air (&quot;see&quot; dust explosion). Some devastating explosions have occurred at flour mills, including an explosion in 1878 at the Washburn &quot;A&quot; Mill in Minneapolis that killed 22 people.

=== Pathogens ===
The CDC has cautioned not to eat raw flour doughs or batters. Raw flour can contain bacteria like &quot;E. coli&quot; and needs to be cooked like other foods.

== Products ==
Bread, pasta, crackers, many cakes, and many other foods are made using flour. Wheat flour is also used to make a roux as a base for thickening gravy and sauces.
It can also be used as an ingredient in papier-mâché glue.

Cornstarch is a principal ingredient used to thicken many puddings or desserts, and is the main ingredient in packaged custard.

<doc id="56239" wikidata="Q342939" url="?curid=56239" title="Acrylamide">
<text>Acrylamide (or acrylic amide) is an organic compound with the chemical formula CH2=CHC(O)NH2. It is a white odorless solid, soluble in water and several organic solvents. From the chemistry perspective, acrylamide is a vinyl-substituted primary amide (CONH2). It is produced industrially mainly as a precursor to polyacrylamides, which find many uses as water-soluble thickeners and flocculation agents.

Acrylamide forms in burnt areas of food, particularly starchy foods like potatoes, when cooked with high heat, above . Despite health scares following this discovery in 2002, and its classification as a probable carcinogen, acrylamide from diet is thought unlikely to cause cancer in humans; Cancer Research UK categorized the idea that eating burnt food causes cancer as a &quot;myth&quot;.

==Production==
Acrylamide can be prepared by the hydration of acrylonitrile, which is catalyzed enzymatically:
:CH2=CHCN + H2O → CH2=CHC(O)NH2

This reaction also is catalyzed by sulfuric acid as well as various metal salts. Treatment of acrylonitrile with sulfuric acid gives acrylamide sulfate, . This salt can be converted to acrylamide with a base or to methyl acrylate with methanol.

==Uses==
The majority of acrylamide is used to manufacture various polymers, especially polyacrylamide. This water-soluble polymer, which has very low toxicity, is widely used as thickener and flocculating agent. These functions are valuable in the purification of drinking water, corrosion inhibition, mineral extraction, and paper making. Polyacrylamide gels are routinely used in medicine and biochemistry for purification and assays.

==Toxicity and carcinogenicity==
Acrylamide can arise in some cooked foods via a series of steps by the reaction of the amino acid asparagine and glucose. This condensation, one of the Maillard reactions, followed by dehydrogenation produces &quot;N&quot;-(-glucos-1-yl)--asparagine, which upon pyrolysis generates some acrylamide.

The discovery in 2002 that some cooked foods contain acrylamide attracted significant attention to its possible biological effects. IARC, NTP, and the EPA have classified it as a probable carcinogen, although epidemiological studies (as of 2019) suggest that dietary acrylamide consumption does not significantly increase people&#x27;s risk of developing cancer.

===Europe===
According to the EFSA, the main toxicity risks of acrylamide are &quot;Neurotoxicity, adverse effects on male reproduction, developmental toxicity and carcinogenicity&quot;. However, according to their research, there is no concern on non-neoplastic effects. Furthermore, while the relation between consumption of acrylamide and cancer in rats and mice has been shown, it is still unclear whether acrylamide consumption has an effect on the risk of developing cancer in humans, and existing epidemiological studies in humans are very limited and do not show any relation between acrylamide and cancer in humans. Food industry workers exposed to twice the average level of acrylamide do not exhibit higher cancer rates.

===United States===
Acrylamide is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

Acrylamide is considered a potential occupational carcinogen by U.S. government agencies and classified as a Group 2A carcinogen by the IARC. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set dermal occupational exposure limits at 0.03 mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday.

===Opinions of health organizations===
Baking, grilling or broiling food causes significant concentrations of acrylamide. This discovery in 2002 led to international health concerns. Subsequent research has however found that it is not likely that the acrylamides in burnt or well-cooked food cause cancer in humans; Cancer Research UK categorizes the idea that burnt food causes cancer as a &quot;myth&quot;.

The American Cancer Society says that laboratory studies have shown that acrylamide is likely to be a carcinogen, but that evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that dietary acrylamide is unlikely to raise the risk of people developing most common types of cancer.

===Hazards===
Radiolabeled acrylamide is also a skin irritant and may be a tumor initiator in the skin, potentially increasing risk for skin cancer. Symptoms of acrylamide exposure include dermatitis in the exposed area, and peripheral neuropathy.

Laboratory research has found that some phytochemicals may have the potential to be developed into drugs which could alleviate the toxicity of acrylamide.

===Mechanism of action===

Acrylamide is metabolized to the genotoxic derivative glycidamide. On the other hand, acrylamide and glycidamide can be detoxified via conjugation with glutathione.

==Occurrence in food==

Acrylamide was discovered in foods, mainly in starchy foods, such as potato chips (UK: &quot;potato crisps&quot;), French fries (UK: &quot;chips&quot;), and bread that had been heated higher than . Production of acrylamide in the heating process was shown to be temperature-dependent. It was not found in food that had been boiled, or in foods that were not heated.

Acrylamide has been found in roasted barley tea, called &quot;mugicha&quot; in Japanese. The barley is roasted so it is dark brown prior to being steeped in hot water. The roasting process produced 200–600 micrograms/kg of acrylamide in mugicha. This is less than the &gt;1000 micrograms/kg found in potato crisps and other fried whole potato snack foods cited in the same study and it is unclear how much of this enters the drink to be ingested. Rice cracker and sweet potato levels were lower than in potatoes. Potatoes cooked whole were found to have significantly lower acrylamide levels than the others, suggesting a link between food preparation method and acrylamide levels.

Acrylamide levels appear to rise as food is heated for longer periods of time. Although researchers are still unsure of the precise mechanisms by which acrylamide forms in foods, many believe it is a byproduct of the Maillard reaction. In fried or baked goods, acrylamide may be produced by the reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars (fructose, glucose, etc.) or reactive carbonyls at temperatures above .

Later studies have found acrylamide in black olives, dried plums, dried pears, coffee, and peanuts.

The US FDA has analyzed a variety of U.S. food products for levels of acrylamide since 2002.

==Occurrence in cigarettes==
Cigarette smoking is a major acrylamide source. It has been shown in one study to cause an increase in blood acrylamide levels three-fold greater than any dietary factor.

<text>Premier is a title for the head of government in central governments, state governments and local governments of some countries. A second in command to a premier is designated as a deputy premier.

A premier will normally be a head of government, but is not the head of state. In presidential systems, the two roles are often combined into one, whereas in parliamentary systems of government the two are usually kept separate.

&quot;Premier&quot; is often the title of the heads of government in sub-national entities, such as the provinces and territories of Canada, states of the Commonwealth of Australia, provinces of South Africa, the island of Nevis within the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. In some of these cases, the formal title remains &quot;Prime Minister&quot; but &quot;Premier&quot; is used to avoid confusion with the national leader. In these cases, care should be taken not to confuse the title of &quot;premier&quot; with &quot;prime minister&quot;. In these countries, terms such as &quot;Federal Premier&quot;, &quot;National Premier&quot; or &quot;Premier of the Dominion&quot; were sometimes used to refer to prime ministers, although these are now obsolete.

==Etymology==

The word comes from French which means prime minister. &quot;Premier&quot; meaning &#x27;first&#x27;, coming from Latin &quot;prīmārius&quot;. This is why in many nations, &quot;premier&quot; is used interchangeably with &quot;prime minister&quot;.

==Examples by country==
 &quot;premier&quot; is the official title for the heads of government in Australia&#x27;s six states. The term &quot;chief minister&quot; is the title of the head of government in Australia&#x27;s two self-governing territories, and is effectively equivalent to a premier.

 &quot;premier&quot; is more common and official, but &quot;prime minister&quot; is still used (see Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China).

 the head of government is officially the President of the Executive Yuan, but it can also be abbreviated to Premier.

 the head of government is referred to as the “Premier”, however, as a British Overseas Territory, the British Monarch is the head of state, and the British government often has the last say on external affairs.

 &quot;Premier&quot; means the &quot;Prime Minister&quot;. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a sub-national entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in the cantons, the head of government has the formal title of &quot;premier&quot;, often anglicized as &quot;prime minister&quot;, while the national prime minister is Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but &quot;premier&quot; is sometimes colloquially used.

 the head of government is colloquially called “Premiér”, and the Czech language translates both “Premier” and “Prime Minister” as “Premiér”. However, although his post is commonly translated in English as “Prime Minister”, the official title as per articles 67 and 68 of the Constitution is “Předseda vlády”, literally “President of the Government”.

 the head of government is officially called “President of the Government” (&quot;predsjednik vlade&quot;) but “Premier” (&quot;premijer&quot;) is colloquially used.

 the head of government is officially called &quot;President of the Government&quot; (&quot;predsednik vlade&quot;) but &quot;Premier&quot; (&quot;premijer&quot;) is colloquially used.

 the head of government is officially called &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot; () but &quot;Premier&quot; (polish for Prime Minister) is colloquially used.

 the President of the Council of Ministers, an office equivalent to prime minister, is informally referred to as the &quot;Premier&quot;.

 the head of the government is named premier (Macedonian премиер, &quot;premier&quot;), usually translated in English as prime minister.

 the title of premier was applied to the Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, named Chairman of the Council of Ministers after 1946, which became the Prime Minister of the Soviet Union in 1991.

 the head of the Sarawak state government is known as the Premier of Sarawak following a state constitutional amendment in 2022, a move widely seen to reflect the status of Sarawak as an equal partner with Sabah and Malaya in Malaysia as stipulated in the 1963 Malaysia Agreement (MA63).

 the term premier is colloquially used as a synonym of prime minister. In the Dutch language, the official and also commonly used term is &quot;minister president&quot;, so this is even a third synonym, but this is normally not translated literally into the English language.

<text>At the time of the Spanish conquest of Yucatán (1527–1546), Ix Tab or Ixtab ([iʃˈtaɓ]; &quot;Rope Woman&quot;, &quot;Hangwoman&quot;) was the indigenous Maya goddess of suicide by hanging. Playing the role of a psychopomp, she would accompany such suicides to heaven.

== Sources ==
The only description of the goddess occurs in the &quot;Relación&quot; of the 16th-century Spanish inquisitor Diego de Landa:

Beyond this description, there is only a very brief and somewhat obscure mention of Ix Tab in the Book of Chilam Balam of Tizimin and in the Pérez Codex, in a context of chaos, suffering, and hangings: &quot;They suspended Ix Tab from their hands&quot;, or, alternatively, &quot;Ix Tab suspended them from her hands&quot;.

== Comparisons ==
&quot;Ix Tab&quot; is the female form of &quot;ah tab&quot;, &quot;hangman&quot;. The function of Ix Tab as a benevolent &quot;hangwoman&quot; could derive from a basic association with snares. Landa (Tozzer 1941: 155) mentions the hunting deity [&quot;Ah&quot;] &quot;Tabay&quot; (&quot;Ensnarer&quot; or &quot;Deceiver&quot;), possibly a patron of hunting with snares, including such that hoist the prey into the air. Animals hoisted by such snares are found depicted in the Dresden and Madrid codices, the Madrid codex (MC45c) personifying one of these traps by a male hunting deity. Ix Tab could be understood as a specialized, female form of such a deity, luring the human quarry into the hanging rope personified by her. Suicides freely putting their heads into this &quot;snare&quot; (prompted, perhaps, by a dream) could then be seen to consecrate themselves to her. On the other hand, the Xtabay of contemporary folklore is a seductive female demon &quot;ensnaring&quot; or &quot;deceiving&quot; her male human preys so as to madden and destroy them.

== Dresden Codex ==
The Dresden Codex picture (DC53b) of a dead woman with a rope around the neck, suspended from a celestial bar, is often, and without further proof, taken to represent Ix Tab. However, since the picture occurs in a section devoted to eclipses of sun and moon, it may rather have been used to symbolize a lunar eclipse and its dire consequences for women, who were intimately associated with the moon goddess.

== As possible fabrication ==
It has been claimed that the Pre-Spanish Maya did not have a suicide goddess, or a significant narrative of suicide by hanging. Originally, Ix Tab may only have been a hunting goddess (see above, Comparisons). Today, the sensationalist idea of a &quot;cult of Ix Tab&quot; appears to be invoked by popular Yucatecan media to portray suicide as an indigenous problem, given that Yucatán has a suicide rate more than twice that of Mexico at large.

<doc id="56244" wikidata="Q83003" url="?curid=56244" title="Antonio Gramsci">
<text>Antonio Francesco Gramsci ( , ; ; 22 January 1891 – 27 April 1937) was an Italian Marxist philosopher, linguist, journalist, writer, and politician. He wrote on philosophy, political theory, sociology, history, and linguistics. He was a founding member and one-time leader of the Italian Communist Party. A vocal critic of Benito Mussolini and fascism, he was imprisoned in 1926, where he remained until shortly before his death in 1937.

During his imprisonment, Gramsci wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis. His &quot;Prison Notebooks&quot; are considered a highly original contribution to 20th-century political theory. Gramsci drew insights from varying sources — not only other Marxists but also thinkers such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Vilfredo Pareto, Georges Sorel, and Benedetto Croce. The notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including the history of Italy and Italian nationalism, the French Revolution, fascism, Taylorism and Fordism, civil society, the state, historical materialism, folklore, religion, and high and popular culture.

Gramsci is best known for his theory of cultural hegemony, which describes how the state and ruling capitalist class — the bourgeoisie — use cultural institutions to maintain wealth and power in capitalist societies. In Gramsci&#x27;s view, the bourgeoisie develops a hegemonic culture using ideology rather than violence, economic force, or coercion. He also attempted to break from the economic determinism of orthodox Marxist thought, and so is sometimes described as a neo-Marxist. He held a humanistic understanding of Marxism, seeing it as a philosophy of praxis and an absolute historicism that transcends traditional materialism and traditional idealism.

==Life==
===Early life===
Gramsci was born in Ales, in the province of Oristano, on the island of Sardinia, the fourth of seven sons of Francesco Gramsci (1860–1937) and Giuseppina Marcias (1861–1932). Francesco Gramsci was born in the small town of Gaeta, in the province of Latina, Lazio (today in the central Italian region of Lazio but at the time Gaeta was still part of Terra di Lavoro of Southern Italy), to a well-off family from the southern Italian regions of Campania and Calabria and of Arbëreshë (Italo-Albanian) descent. Gramsci himself believed that his father&#x27;s family had left Albania as recently as 1821. The Albanian origin of his father&#x27;s family is attested in the surname Gramsci, an Italianised form of &quot;Gramshi&quot;, which stems from the definite noun of the placename Gramsh, a small town in central-eastern Albania. Gramsci&#x27;s mother belonged to a Sardinian landowning family from Sorgono, in the province of Nuoro. Francesco Gramsci worked as a low-level official, and his financial difficulties and troubles with the police forced the family to move about through several villages in Sardinia until they finally settled in Ghilarza.
In 1898, Gramsci&#x27;s father was convicted of embezzlement and imprisoned, reducing his family to destitution. The young Gramsci had to abandon schooling and work at various casual jobs until his father&#x27;s release in 1904. As a boy, Gramsci suffered from health problems, particularly a malformation of the spine that stunted his growth, as his adult height was less than 5 feet, and left him seriously hunchbacked. For decades, it was reported that his condition had been due to a childhood accident — specifically, having been dropped by a nanny — but more recently it has been suggested that it was due to Pott disease, a form of tuberculosis that can cause deformity of the spine. Gramsci was also plagued by various internal disorders throughout his life.

Gramsci started secondary school in Santu Lussurgiu and completed it in Cagliari, where he lodged with his elder brother Gennaro, a former soldier whose time on the mainland had made him a militant socialist. At the time, Gramsci&#x27;s sympathies did not yet lie with socialism but rather with Sardinian autonomism, as well as the grievances of impoverished Sardinian peasants and miners, whose mistreatment by the mainlanders would later deeply contribute to his intellectual growth. They perceived their neglect as a result of privileges enjoyed by the rapidly industrialising Northern Italy, and they tended to turn to a growing Sardinian nationalism, brutally repressed by troops from the Italian mainland, as a response.

===Turin===
In 1911, Gramsci won a scholarship to study at the University of Turin, sitting the exam at the same time as Palmiro Togliatti. At Turin, he read literature and took a keen interest in linguistics, which he studied under Matteo Bartoli. Gramsci was in Turin while it was going through industrialization, with the Fiat and Lancia factories recruiting workers from poorer regions. Trade unions became established, and the first industrial social conflicts started to emerge. Gramsci frequented socialist circles as well as associating with Sardinian emigrants on the Italian mainland. Both his earlier experiences in Sardinia and his environment on the mainland shaped his worldview. Gramsci joined the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) in late 1913, where he would later occupy a key position and observe from Turin the Russian Revolution.
Although showing a talent for his studies, Gramsci had financial problems and poor health. Together with his growing political commitment, these led to him abandoning his education in early 1915, at age 24. By this time he had acquired an extensive knowledge of history and philosophy. At university, he had come into contact with the thought of Antonio Labriola, Rodolfo Mondolfo, Giovanni Gentile, and most importantly, Benedetto Croce, possibly the most widely respected Italian intellectual of his day. Labriola especially propounded a brand of Hegelian Marxism that he labelled &quot;philosophy of praxis&quot;. Although Gramsci later used this phrase to escape the prison censors, his relationship with this current of thought was ambiguous throughout his life.

From 1914 onward, Gramsci&#x27;s writings for socialist newspapers such as &quot;Il Grido del Popolo&quot; () earned him a reputation as a notable journalist. In 1916 he became co-editor of the Piedmont edition of &quot;Avanti!&quot;, the Socialist Party official organ. An articulate and prolific writer of political theory, Gramsci proved a formidable commentator, writing on all aspects of Turin&#x27;s social and political events. Gramsci was at this time also involved in the education and organisation of Turin workers; he spoke in public for the first time in 1916 and gave talks on topics such as Romain Rolland, the French Revolution, the Paris Commune, and the emancipation of women. In the wake of the arrest of Socialist Party leaders that followed the revolutionary riots in August 1917, Gramsci became one of Turin&#x27;s leading socialists; he was elected to the party&#x27;s provisional committee and also made editor of &quot;Il Grido del Popolo&quot;.

In April 1919, with Togliatti, Angelo Tasca and Umberto Terracini, Gramsci set up the weekly newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot; (The New Order). In October of the same year, despite being divided into various hostile factions, the PSI moved by a large majority to join the Third International. Vladimir Lenin saw the &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot; group as closest in orientation to the Bolsheviks, and it received his backing against the anti-parliamentary programme of a left communist, Amadeo Bordiga.

In the course of tactical debates within the party, Gramsci&#x27;s group mainly stood out due to its advocacy of workers&#x27; councils, which had come into existence in Turin spontaneously during the large strikes of 1919 and 1920. For Gramsci, these councils were the proper means of enabling workers to take control of the task of organising production, and saw them as preparing &quot;the whole class for the aims of conquest and government&quot;. Although he believed his position at this time to be in keeping with Lenin&#x27;s policy of &quot;All Power to the Soviets&quot;, his stance that these Italian councils were communist rather than just one organ of political struggle against the bourgeoisie, was attacked by Bordiga for betraying a syndicalist tendency influenced by the thought of Georges Sorel and Daniel De Leon. By the time of the defeat of the Turin workers in spring 1920, Gramsci was almost alone in his defence of the councils.

===Communist Party of Italy===

The failure of the workers&#x27; councils to develop into a national movement convinced Gramsci that a Communist party in the Leninist sense was needed. The group around &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot; declaimed incessantly against the PSI&#x27;s centrist leadership and ultimately allied with Bordiga&#x27;s far larger abstentionist faction. On 21 January 1921, in the town of Livorno (Leghorn), the Communist Party of Italy (, PCd&#x27;I) was founded. In opposition to Bordiga, Gramsci supported the &quot;Arditi del Popolo&quot;, a militant anti-fascist group which struggled against the Blackshirts. Gramsci would be a leader of the party from its inception but was subordinate to Bordiga, whose emphasis on discipline, centralism and purity of principles dominated the party&#x27;s programme until the latter lost the leadership in 1924. In 1922, Gramsci travelled to Russia as a representative of the new party. Here, he met Julia Schucht (Yulia Apollonovna Schucht, 1896–1980), a young Jewish violinist whom he married in 1923 and with whom he had two sons, Delio (1924–1982) and Giuliano (1926–2007). Gramsci never saw his second son.
The Russian mission coincided with the advent of fascism in Italy, and Gramsci returned with instructions to foster, against the wishes of the PCd&#x27;I leadership, a united front of leftist parties against fascism. Such a front would ideally have had the PCd&#x27;I at its centre, through which Moscow would have controlled all the leftist forces, but others disputed this potential supremacy, as socialists had a significant, while communists seemed relatively young and too radical. Many believed that an eventual coalition led by communists would have functioned too remotely from political debate, and thus would have run the risk of isolation.

In late 1922 and early 1923, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s government embarked on a campaign of repression against the opposition parties, arresting most of the PCd&#x27;I leadership, including Bordiga. At the end of 1923, Gramsci travelled from Moscow to Vienna, where he tried to revive a party torn by factional strife. In 1924, Gramsci, now recognised as head of the PCd&#x27;I, gained election as a deputy for the Veneto. He started organizing the launch of the official newspaper of the party, called (Unity), living in Rome while his family stayed in Moscow. At its Lyon Congress in January 1926, Gramsci&#x27;s theses calling for a united front to restore democracy to Italy were adopted by the party.

In 1926, Joseph Stalin&#x27;s manoeuvres inside the Bolshevik party moved Gramsci to write a letter to the Comintern in which he deplored the opposition led by Leon Trotsky but also underlined some presumed faults of the leader. Togliatti, in Moscow as a representative of the party, received the letter, opened it, read it, and decided not to deliver it. This caused a difficult conflict between Gramsci and Togliatti which they never completely resolved.

===Imprisonment and death===

On 9 November 1926, the Fascist government enacted a new wave of emergency laws, taking as a pretext an alleged attempt on Mussolini&#x27;s life that had occurred several days earlier. The Fascist police arrested Gramsci, despite his parliamentary immunity, and brought him to the Roman prison &quot;Regina Coeli&quot;. At his trial, Gramsci&#x27;s prosecutor stated: &quot;For twenty years we must stop this brain from functioning.&quot; He received an immediate sentence of five years in confinement on the island of Ustica, and the following year he received a sentence of 20 years&#x27; imprisonment in Turi, Apulia, near Bari.

Over 11 years in prison, his health deteriorated. Over this period, &quot;his teeth fell out, his digestive system collapsed so that he could not eat solid food... he had convulsions when he vomited blood and suffered headaches so violent that he beat his head against the walls of his cell.&quot; An international campaign, organised by Piero Sraffa at Cambridge University and Gramsci&#x27;s sister-in-law Tatiana, was mounted to demand Gramsci&#x27;s release. In 1933, he was moved from the prison at Turi to a clinic at Formia; he was still being denied adequate medical attention. Two years later, he was moved to the Quisisana clinic in Rome. He was due for release on 21 April 1937 and planned to retire to Sardinia for convalescence, but a combination of arteriosclerosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, high blood pressure, angina, gout, and acute gastric disorders meant that he was too ill to move.

Gramsci died on 27 April 1937, at the age of 46. His ashes are buried in the Cimitero Acattolico in Rome. By moving Gramsci from prison to hospital when he became very ill, the Mussolini regime was attempting to avoid the accusation that it was his incarceration that caused his death. Nevertheless, his death was linked directly to prison conditions. Gramsci&#x27;s grandson, Antonio Jr., speculated that Gramsci had been working with the Soviet government to facilitate a move to Moscow, but changed course as the political climate in Russia intensified in 1936.

==Philosophical work==

Gramsci was one of the most influential Marxist thinkers of the 20th century, and a particularly key thinker in the development of Western Marxism. He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. These writings, known as the &quot;Prison Notebooks&quot;, contain Gramsci&#x27;s tracing of Italian history and nationalism, as well as some ideas in Marxist theory, critical theory, and educational theory associated with his name, such as:
* Cultural hegemony as a means of maintaining and legitimising the capitalist state
* The need for popular workers&#x27; education to encourage the development of intellectuals from the working class
* An analysis of the modern capitalist state that distinguishes between political society, which dominates directly and coercively, and civil society, where leadership is constituted through consent
* Absolute historicism
* A critique of economic determinism that opposes fatalistic interpretations of Marxism
* A critique of philosophical materialism

===Hegemony===

Hegemony was a term previously used by Marxists such as Vladimir Lenin to denote the political leadership of the working class in a democratic revolution. Gramsci greatly expanded this concept, developing an acute analysis of how the ruling capitalist class — the bourgeoisie — establishes and maintains its control.

Classical Marxism had predicted that socialist revolution was inevitable in capitalist societies. By the early 20th century, no such revolution had occurred in the most advanced nations, and those revolutions of 1917–1923, such as in Germany or the Biennio Rosso in Italy, had failed. As capitalism seemed more entrenched than ever, Gramsci suggested that it maintained control not just through violence and political and economic coercion but also through ideology. The bourgeoisie developed a hegemonic culture, which propagated its own values and norms so that they became the common sense values of all. People in the working class and other classes identified their own good with the good of the bourgeoisie and helped to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot; rather than revolting.

To counter the notion that bourgeois values represented natural or normal values for society, the working class needed to develop a culture of its own. While Lenin held that culture was ancillary to political objectives, Gramsci saw it as fundamental to the attainment of power that cultural hegemony be achieved first. In Gramsci&#x27;s view, a class cannot dominate in modern conditions by merely advancing its own narrow economic interests, and neither can it dominate purely through force and coercion. Rather, it must exert intellectual and moral leadership, and make alliances and compromises with a variety of forces. Gramsci calls this union of social forces a &quot;historic bloc&quot;, taking a term from Georges Sorel. This bloc forms the basis of consent to a certain social order, which produces and re-produces the hegemony of the dominant class through a nexus of institutions, social relations, and ideas. In this way, Gramsci&#x27;s theory emphasized the importance of the political and ideological superstructure in both maintaining and fracturing relations of the economic base.

Gramsci stated that bourgeois cultural values were tied to folklore, popular culture and religion, and therefore much of his analysis of hegemonic culture is aimed at these. He was also impressed by the influence that the Catholic Church had and the care it had taken to prevent an excessive gap from developing between the religion of the learned and that of the less educated. Gramsci saw Marxism as a marriage of the purely intellectual critique of religion found in Renaissance humanism and the elements of the Reformation that had appealed to the masses. For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people&#x27;s spiritual needs, and to do so people would have to think of it as an expression of their own experience.

===Intellectuals and education===
Gramsci gave much thought to the role of intellectuals in society. He stated that all men are intellectuals, in that all have intellectual and rational faculties, but not all men have the social function of intellectuals. He saw modern intellectuals not as talkers but as practical-minded directors and organisers who produced hegemony through ideological apparatuses such as education and the media. Furthermore, he distinguished between a traditional intelligentsia, which sees itself (in his view, wrongly) as a class apart from society, and the thinking groups that every class produces from its own ranks organically. Such organic intellectuals do not simply describe social life in accordance with scientific rules but instead articulate, through the language of culture, the feelings and experiences which the masses could not express for themselves. To Gramsci, it was the duty of organic intellectuals to speak to the obscured precepts of folk wisdom, or common sense (&quot;senso comune&quot;), of their respective political spheres. These intellectuals would represent excluded social groups of a society, or what Gramsci referred to as the subaltern.

In line with Gramsci&#x27;s theories of cultural hegemony, he argued that capitalist power needed to be challenged by building a counter-hegemony. By this, he meant that, as part of the war of position, the organic intellectuals and others within the working-class, need to develop alternative values and an alternative ideology in contrast to bourgeois ideology. He argued that the reason this had not needed to happen in Russia was because the Russian ruling class did not have genuine cultural hegemony. So the Bolsheviks were able to carry out a war of manoeuvre (the Russian Revolution of 1917) relatively easily because ruling-class hegemony had never been fully achieved. He believed that a final war of manoeuvre was only possible, in the developed and advanced capitalist societies, when the war of position had been won by the organic intellectuals and the working class building a counter-hegemony.

The need to create a working-class culture and a counter-hegemony relates to Gramsci&#x27;s call for a kind of education that could develop working-class intellectuals, whose task was to introduce Marxist ideology into the consciousness of the proletariat as a set of foreign notions but to renovate the existing intellectual activity of the masses and make it natively critical of the status quo. His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of critical pedagogy and popular education as theorized and practised in later decades by Paulo Freire in Brazil, and have much in common with the thought of Frantz Fanon. For this reason, partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci&#x27;s writings and ideas important to this day.

===State and civil society===
Gramsci&#x27;s theory of hegemony is tied to his conception of the capitalist state. Gramsci does not understand the state in the narrow sense of the government. Instead, he divides it between political society (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) — the arena of political institutions and legal constitutional control — and civil society (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) — commonly seen as the private or non-state sphere, which mediates between the state and the economy. He stresses that the division is purely conceptual and that the two often overlap in reality.

Gramsci posits that the capitalist state rules through force plus consent: political society is the realm of force and civil society is the realm of consent. He argues that under modern capitalism the bourgeoisie can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by trade unions and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sphere. Thus, the bourgeoisie engages in passive revolution by going beyond its immediate economic interests and allowing the forms of its hegemony to change. Gramsci posits that movements such as reformism and fascism, as well as the scientific management and assembly line methods of Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford respectively, are examples of this.

Drawing from Niccolò Machiavelli, Gramsci argues that the modern Prince — the revolutionary party — is the force that will allow the working class to develop organic intellectuals and an alternative hegemony within civil society. For Gramsci, the complex nature of modern civil society means that a war of position, carried out by revolutionaries through political agitation, the trade unions, advancement of proletarian culture, and other ways to create an opposing civil society was necessary alongside a war of manoeuvre — a direct revolution — in order to have a successful revolution without danger of a counter-revolution or degeneration.

Despite his claim that the lines between the two may be blurred, Gramsci rejects the state worship that results from equating political society with civil society, as was done by the Jacobins and fascists. He believes the proletariat&#x27;s historical task is to create a regulated society, where political society is diminished and civil society is expanded. He defines the withering away of the state as the full development of civil society&#x27;s ability to regulate itself.

===Historicism===
Like the young Marx, Gramsci was an emphatic proponent of historicism. In Gramsci&#x27;s view, all meaning derives from the relation between human practical activity (or praxis) and the objective historical and social processes of which it is a part. Ideas cannot be understood outside their social and historical context, apart from their function and origin. The concepts by which we organise our knowledge of the world do not derive primarily from our relation to objects, but rather from the social relations between the users of those concepts. As a result, there is no such thing as an unchanging human nature but only historically variable social relationships. Furthermore, philosophy and science do not reflect a reality independent of man. Rather, a theory can be said to be true when, in any given historical situation, it expresses the real developmental trend of that situation.

For the majority of Marxists, truth was truth no matter when and where it was known, and scientific knowledge, which included Marxism, accumulated historically as the advance of truth in this everyday sense. In this view, Marxism (or the Marxist theory of history and economics) did not belong to the illusory realm of the superstructure because it is a science. In contrast, Gramsci believed Marxism was true in a socially pragmatic sense: by articulating the class consciousness of the proletariat, Marxism expressed the truth of its times better than any other theory. This anti-scientistic and anti-positivist stance was indebted to the influence of Benedetto Croce. At the same time, it should be underlined that Gramsci&#x27;s absolute historicism broke with Croce&#x27;s tendency to secure a metaphysical synthesis of historical destiny. Although Gramsci repudiates the charge, his historical account of truth has been criticised as a form of relativism.

===Critique of economism===
In a pre-prison article titled &quot;The Revolution against &quot;, Gramsci wrote that the October Revolution in Russia had invalidated the idea that socialist revolution had to await the full development of capitalist forces of production. This reflected his view that Marxism was not a determinist philosophy. The principle of the causal primacy of the forces of production was a misconception of Marxism. Both economic changes and cultural changes are expressions of a basic historical process, and it is difficult to say which sphere has primacy over the other.

The belief from the earliest years of the workers&#x27; movement that it would inevitably triumph due to historical laws was a product of the historical circumstances of an oppressed class restricted mainly to defensive action. This fatalistic doctrine must be abandoned as a hindrance once the working class becomes able to take the initiative. Because Marxism is a philosophy of praxis, it cannot rely on unseen historical laws as the agents of social change. History is defined by human praxis and therefore includes human will. Nonetheless, willpower cannot achieve anything it likes in any given situation: when the consciousness of the working class reaches the stage of development necessary for action, it will encounter historical circumstances that cannot be arbitrarily altered. It is not predetermined by historical inevitability as to which of several possible developments will take place as a result.

His critique of economic determinism extended to that practised by the syndicalists of the Italian trade unions. He believed that many trade unionists had settled for a reformist, gradualist approach in that they had refused to struggle on the political front in addition to the economic front. For Gramsci, much as the ruling class can look beyond its own immediate economic interests to reorganise the forms of its own hegemony, so must the working class present its own interests as congruous with the universal advancement of society. While Gramsci envisioned the trade unions as one organ of a counter-hegemonic force in a capitalist society, the trade union leaders simply saw these organizations as a means to improve conditions within the existing structure. Gramsci referred to the views of these trade unionists as vulgar economism, which he equated to covert reformism and liberalism.

===Critique of materialism===
By virtue of his belief that human history and collective praxis determine whether any philosophical question is meaningful or not, Gramsci&#x27;s views run contrary to the metaphysical materialism and copy theory of perception advanced by Friedrich Engels, and Lenin, although he does not explicitly state this. For Gramsci, Marxism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself, independent of humanity. The concept of an objective universe outside of human history and human praxis was analogous to belief in God. Gramsci defined objectivity in terms of a universal intersubjectivity to be established in a future communist society. Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history. In his view philosophical materialism resulted from a lack of critical thought, and could not be said to oppose religious dogma and superstition. Despite this, Gramsci resigned himself to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism. Marxism was a philosophy for the proletariat, a subaltern class, and thus could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense. Nonetheless, it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents&#x27; views.

==Legacy==
According to the American socialist magazine &quot;Jacobin&quot;, Gramsci &quot;is one of the most cited Italian authors — certainly the most cited Italian Marxist ever — and one of the most celebrated Marxist philosophers of the twentieth century.&quot;, adding that the &quot;Prison Notebooks&quot; &quot;allowed his unorthodox Marxism to spread worldwide.&quot;

Gramsci&#x27;s thought emanates from the organised political left but has also become an important figure in current academic discussions within cultural studies and critical theory. Political theorists from the political centre and the political right have also found insight into his concepts; for instance, his idea of hegemony has become widely cited. His influence is particularly strong in contemporary political science, such as neo-Gramscianism. His critics charge him with fostering a notion of power struggle through ideas. They find the Gramscian approach to philosophical analysis, reflected in current academic controversies, to conflict with open-ended, liberal inquiry grounded in apolitical readings of the classics of Western culture. Some critics have argued that Gramsci&#x27;s attempt to reconcile Marxism with intellectualism creates an ideological elitism that can be seen as at odds with individual liberty. 

His theory of hegemony has drawn criticism from those who believe that the promotion of state intervention in cultural affairs risks undermining the free exchange of ideas, which is essential for a truly open society.

As a socialist, Gramsci&#x27;s legacy has been met with a mixed reception. Togliatti, who led the party (renamed in 1943 as the Italian Communist Party, PCI) after World War II and whose gradualist approach was a forerunner to Eurocommunism, stated that the PCI&#x27;s practices during this period were congruent with Gramscian thought. It is speculated that he would likely have been expelled from his party if his true views had been known, particularly his growing hostility towards Joseph Stalin.

One issue for Gramsci related to his speaking on topics of violence and when it might be justified or not. When the socialist Giacomo Matteotti was murdered, Gramsci did not condemn the murder. Matteotti had already called for the rule of law and had been murdered by the fascists for that stance. The murder produced a crisis for the Italian fascist regime that Gramsci could have exploited. The historian Jean-Yves Frétigné argues that Gramsci and the socialists more generally were naïve in their assessment of the fascists and as a result underestimated the brutality of which the regime was capable.

In Thailand, Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, an academic, democratic activist, and former Secretary-General of Future Forward Party, cited Gramsci&#x27;s idea as the main key to establishing a party.

==Personal life==
===Association football===
Like fellow Turinese and communist Palmiro Togliatti, Gramsci took an interest in association football, which was becoming a sport with massive following and was elected by the fascist regime in Italy as a national sport, and was said to have been a supporter of Juventus, as were other notable communist and left-wing leaders. On 16 December 1988, the PCI&#x27;s newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot; published an article on the front page titled &quot;Gramsci Was Rooting for Juve&quot;. Signed by Giorgio Fabre, it contained some letters in which Gramsci asked Piero Sraffa for &quot;news from our Juventus&quot;. Even though those letters later turned out to be false, the article remains part of the Gramscian bibliography and triggered numerous reactions, including from Giampiero Boniperti, who on behalf of the club the following day told at &quot;La Stampa&quot;: &quot;We are pleased to know that among our fans there have been personalities who have marked an era from the political, economic, and intellectual point of view. This shows that Juventus truly have something special, a charm that has never lost strength over the years.&quot; Gramsci&#x27;s interest in football dates back to a 16 August 1918 article for the PSI&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Avanti!&quot;, titled &quot;Football and Scopone&quot;. Fifteen years later, he pointed at the degeneration of stadium cheering, which emerged with the advent of fascism and the consequent nationalisation of the sport that he said extinguished political and trade union commitment.

<doc id="56250" wikidata="Q131621834" url="?curid=56250" title="York Rite">
<text>In Anglo-American Freemasonry, York Rite, sometimes referred to as the American Rite, is one of several Rites of Freemasonry. It is named after York, in Yorkshire, England, where the Rite was supposedly first practiced.

A Rite is a series of progressive degrees that are conferred by various Masonic organizations or bodies, each of which operates under the control of its own central authority. The York Rite specifically is a collection of separate Masonic Bodies and associated Degrees that would otherwise operate independently. While the corresponding bodies and degrees are present worldwide, the term is primary used by American freemasons. 

The three primary bodies in the York Rite are the Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, Council of Royal &amp; Select Masters or Council of Cryptic Masons, and the Commandery of Knights Templar, each of which are governed independently but are all considered to be a part of the York Rite. There are also other organizations that are considered to be directly associated with the York Rite, or require York Rite membership to join such as the York Rite Sovereign College but in general the York Rite is considered to be made up of the aforementioned three. The Rite&#x27;s name is derived from the city of York, where, according to one Masonic legend, the first meetings of Masons in England took place.

The York Rite is also one of the concordant bodies of Freemasonry that a Master Mason may join to further his knowledge of Freemasonry. But the York Rite is not found as a single system worldwide, and outside of the United States there are often significant differences in ritual, as well as organization. However, in most cases, provided that the Grand Body in question regards the parent &quot;Craft&quot; jurisdiction as regular, each distinct Order has recognized fraternal inter-relations with the respective Grand Body within the York system.

==York Rite bodies==

Since the York Rite is actually a grouping of separate organizations joined in order, each body operates with relative autonomy. And though they are referred to as one rite it is common for individuals to be member of some bodies and not others. For example, in many jurisdictions Cryptic Masonry can be skipped allowing the person to be a member of just the Royal Arch and Knights Templar. It is also common for non-Christians to join only the Royal Arch and Council of Royal &amp; Select Masters, as the Knights Templar require members to be willing to defend the Christian faith, if needed. Membership in the Royal Arch is always required and must be kept in order to maintain membership in the other two bodies.

Details on the individual bodies are as follows:

===Royal Arch Masonry===

Royal Arch Masonry is the first order a Master Mason joins in the York Rite. The Chapter works the following degrees:

* The &quot;Mark Master Mason&quot; degree is in some respects an extension of the Fellow Crafts&#x27; second degree. In some jurisdictions the degree is conferred in a Fellow Craft Lodge, that is, the second degree of the Blue Lodge.
* The (Virtual) &quot;Past Master&quot; degree is conferred because of the traditional requirement that only Past Masters of a Blue Lodge may be admitted to Holy Royal Arch. Because there are so many applicants for this degree, Virtual Past Master is required to qualify them for it in many U.S. jurisdictions. Other places, such as Pennsylvania and UGLE Masonry, do not have this requirement or procedure. Much of the work is the same given to install the Worshipful Master of a Blue Lodge.
* In the &quot;Most Excellent Master&quot; degree the building of King Solomon&#x27;s Temple, which figures so prominently in Blue Lodge, has been completed. In England the degree is conferred by the Order of Royal and Select Masters, along with three other degrees.
* The &quot;Royal Arch Mason&quot; (or &quot;Holy Royal Arch&quot;) degree is said by many to be the most beautiful degree in all of Freemasonry. Following a convocation of the Supreme Grand Chapter in England on November 10, 2004, there are currently significant ritual differences between what is worked in England and that worked in many U.S. jurisdictions. Fraternal inter-relations remain as before. Freemasons who reach this degree may continue to Cryptic Masonry or go straight to Knights Templar where permitted—requirements vary in different jurisdictions.

===Cryptic Masonry===
Membership in the &quot;Council of Royal &amp; Select Masters&quot; or the &quot;Council of Cryptic Masons&quot; is not required for membership in the Knights Templar in some jurisdictions, so it can be skipped. In others it is required. It is called Cryptic Masonry or the Cryptic Rite because a crypt or underground room figures prominently in the legends told in the degrees.

*&quot;Royal Master&quot;
*&quot;Select Master&quot;
*&quot;Super Excellent Master&quot;

In some jurisdictions, a &quot;Most Excellent Master&quot; degree is offered between Select Master and Super Excellent Master, while other jurisdictions do not have the &quot;Super Excellent Master&quot; degree.

===Knights Templar (Grand Encampment of Knights Templar of the U.S.A.)===
The Knights Templar is the final order joined in the York Rite. Unlike other Masonic bodies which only require a belief in a Supreme Being regardless of religion, membership in the Knights Templar is open only to Christian Masons who have completed their Royal Arch and in some jurisdictions their Cryptic Degrees. This body is modeled on the historical Knights Templar to carry on the spirit of their organization. Throughout history it has been claimed that Freemasonry itself was founded by the Knights Templar or that the Knights Templar took refuge in Freemasonry after their persecution. The Grand Encampment of the United States acknowledges the existence of these theories but states that there is no proof to justify such claims.

A local Knights Templar division is called a Commandery and operates under a state level Grand Commandery as well as The Grand Encampment of the United States. This is unique among Masonic bodies as most report to the state level alone. The Knights Templar confer three orders, and one passing order as opposed to the standard degree system found elsewhere in Freemasonry:

*&quot;The Illustrious Order of the Red Cross&quot;
*&quot;The Passing Order of St. Paul (or the Mediterranean Pass)
*&quot;The Order of the Knights of Malta&quot; (or simply &quot;Order of Malta&quot;)
*&quot;The Order of the Temple&quot;

===Honorary Bodies===
In addition to the Capitular Degrees, Cryptic Degrees, and Chivalric Orders, there are several Honorary Bodies (sometimes called Invitational Bodies) that are associated with the York Rite and for which membership in a Royal Arch Chapter is requisite. Membership is by invitation only and usually only extended to those who have contributed in some significant way to the York Rite. They consist of:

*&quot;Societas Roscicruciana in Civitatibus Fœderatis&quot;
*&quot;Allied Masonic Degrees&quot;
*&quot;Order of Knight Masons&quot;
*&quot;Order of Saint Thomas of Acon&quot;
*&quot;York Rite Sovereign College&quot;
*&quot;Knights of the York Rite Cross of Honor&quot;
*&quot;Holy Royal Arch Knight Templar Priests&quot;
*&quot;Red Cross of Constantine&quot;

==Equivalent independent bodies==

===Mark Master===
*England, India, and parts of Europe and Australasia – The Mark degree is conferred in a separately warranted Lodge of Mark Master Masons. The candidate for Advancement is required to be a Master Mason. A further degree may conferred; one not present in the York Rite, that of Royal Ark Mariner; although strictly speaking this degree is conferred in a Lodge of Royal Ark Mariners – said lodge being &#x27;anchored&#x27; or &#x27;moored&#x27; to the parent Mark Lodge. In the U.S., this degree forms part of the Allied Masonic Degrees. In Canada, the Royal Ark Mariner degree is conferred by a Council of Royal and Select Masters.
*Scotland – The Mark degree is conferred in a Craft lodge and is seen as the completion of the Fellow Craft Degree, but the candidate for Advancement is required to be a Master Mason. The Mark may alternatively, and exceptionally, be conferred in a Holy Royal Arch Chapter as a prerequisite for Exaltation to the HRA. If a Candidate has already received his Mark Degree in his Craft Lodge, then his initiation into the Chapter is preceded by a short ceremony of Affiliation to the Mark Lodge associated (&quot;moored&quot;) to that Chapter.

===Royal and Select Masters===
In England and Wales, the degrees of &quot;Select Master, Royal Master, Most Excellent Master&quot; and &quot;Super-Excellent Master&quot; are conferred in a separately warranted organization, the Order of Royal and Select Masters.

===Royal Arch===

The Royal Arch is affiliated with various constitutions worldwide, many of which place different emphasis on the order.

*England, Europe and Australasia – A Royal Arch Chapter is required to be sponsored by a Craft Lodge and bears the same number, and in almost all cases the same name; however, the HRA is a separate Order from Craft Freemasonry. Supreme Grand Chapter is governed from the headquarters of the United Grand Lodge of England, but the administration remains distinct – though many officers of the Grand Lodge hold the equivalent office in the Grand Chapter. In these countries the Order of the Royal Arch consists of a single &#x27;Royal Arch&#x27; degree, although there are three related ceremonies, one for the installation into each of the three Principals&#x27; chairs. As a compromise, at the union of two rival Grand Lodges in 1813, one of which considered the Royal Arch a &#x27;Fourth Degree&#x27;, whilst the other almost totally ignored it. English Freemasonry recognized the Royal Arch as part of &quot;pure, ancient masonry,&quot; but stated that it was not an additional degree, but merely the &quot;completion of the third degree.&quot; However, this was a compromise position, and one which was in opposition to normal masonic practice, and consequently on November 10, 2004, after much deliberation by a special working party, the Grand Chapter overturned this compromise position at its regular meeting in London, and declared the Royal Arch to be a separate degree in its own right, albeit the natural progression from the third degree. Words in the ritual which propounded the earlier compromise position were removed, by mandatory regulation.
*Ireland – The Royal Arch degree under the Irish Constitution is unique, and while it is regular and recognized, it bears little resemblance to the same degree in the sister Constitutions of England and Scotland. The Royal Arch Degree under the Irish Constitution contains a legend concerning the first Temple, not the second. The elaborate &quot;Passing of the Veils&quot; ceremony is essential to the Royal Arch Degree in the Irish system and after it is completed it is followed immediately by the Royal Arch degree itself, containing the story of the restoration of Solomon&#x27;s Temple under King Josiah. The three presiding officers of a Royal Arch Chapter are called the Excellent King, High Priest and Chief Scribe, instead of First, Second and Third Principal. Irish Royal Arch Chapters are also permitted to meet as Lodges of Mark Master Masons, and they are governed by the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Ireland.
*Scotland – The degree is conferred in a Royal Arch Chapter which is within a wholly different administrative structure, the Supreme Grand Chapter of Scotland. Due to a difference in ritual, Royal Arch Masons exalted in England may not attend Scottish Royal Arch Chapters without completing the Scottish exaltation ceremony. Before receiving the Royal Arch Degree the Candidate must first have the Mark degree and the degree of Excellent Master. However, those Exalted in Scotland may attend Chapter in England, or indeed any Chapter, provided it be in Amity.

===Knights Templar===

====England and Wales====
Officially known as &quot;The United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta, of England and Wales&quot;, this order is colloquially known as the Knights Templar. Local bodies of Knights Templar are known as Preceptories; local bodies of Knights of St Paul are known as Chapters; local bodies of Knights of Malta are known as Priories; all operate under a Grand or Great Priory, often with an intermediate level of Provincial Priories. Although some jurisdictions maintain a separate Great Priory of the Temple and Great Priory of Malta, as, for example, in England, the Grand Master and other officers of both Great Priories hold simultaneous equal office in both bodies. Three degrees are administered in this system:

*&quot;The Degree of Knight Templar (Order of the Temple)&quot;
*&quot;The Degree of Knight of St. Paul (incorporating the Mediterranean Pass)&quot;
*&quot;The Degree of Knight of Malta (Order of Malta)&quot;

Membership is by invitation and candidates are required to be Master Masons, holders of the degree of the Holy Royal Arch and to sign a declaration that they profess the Doctrine of the Holy and Undivided Trinity.

<doc id="56251" wikidata="Q206123" url="?curid=56251" title="Harald Fairhair">
<text>Harald Fairhair (; – ) was a Norwegian king. According to traditions current in Norway and Iceland in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, he reigned from  872 to 930 and was the first King of Norway. Supposedly, two of his sons, Eric Bloodaxe and Haakon the Good, succeeded Harald to become kings after his death.

Much of Harald&#x27;s biography is uncertain. A couple of praise poems by his court poet Þorbjörn Hornklofi survive in fragments, but the extant accounts of his life come from sagas set down in writing around three centuries after his lifetime. His life is described in several of the Kings&#x27; sagas, none of them older than the twelfth century. Their accounts of Harald and his life differ on many points, but it is clear that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries Harald was regarded as having unified Norway into one kingdom.

Since the nineteenth century, when Norway was in a personal union with Sweden, Harald has become a national icon of Norway and a symbol of independence. Though the king&#x27;s sagas and medieval accounts have been critically scrutinised during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, Harald maintains a reputation as the father of the Norwegian nation. At the turn of the 21st century, a few historians have tried to argue that Harald Fairhair did not exist as a historical figure.

==Meaning of epithet ==
Old Norse translates straightforwardly into English as &#x27;hair&#x27;, but , the adjective of which is a form, is trickier to render, since it means &#x27;fair, fine, beautiful&#x27; (but without the moral associations of English &quot;fair&quot;, as opposed to &quot;unfair&quot;). Although it is convenient and conventional to render in English as &#x27;fair-hair(ed)&#x27;, in English &#x27;fair-haired&#x27; means &#x27;blond&#x27;, whereas the Old Norse fairly clearly means &#x27;beautiful-haired&#x27; (in contrast to the epithet which, according to some sources, Haraldr previously bore: , &#x27;(thick) matted hair&#x27;). Accordingly, some translators prefer to render as &#x27;the fine-haired&#x27; or &#x27;fine-hair&#x27; (which, however, unhelpfully implies that Haraldr&#x27;s hairs were thin) or even &#x27;handsome-hair&#x27;.

==Historicity==
Through the nineteenth and most of the twentieth centuries, historians broadly accepted the account of Harald Fairhair given by later Icelandic sagas. However, Peter Sawyer began to cast doubt on this in 1976, and the decades around 2000 saw a wave of revisionist research that suggested that Harald Fairhair did not exist, or at least not in a way resembling his appearance in sagas. The key arguments for this are as follows:
* There is no contemporary support for the claims of later sagas about Harald Fairhair. The first king of Norway recorded in near-contemporary sources is Harald Bluetooth (d. c. 985/986), who is claimed to be the king not only of Denmark but also Norway on the Jelling stones. The late ninth-century account of Norway provided by Ohthere to the court of Alfred the Great (about 890) and the history by Adam of Bremen written in 1075 record no King of Norway for the relevant period. Although sagas have Erik Bloodaxe, who does seem partly to correspond to a historical figure, as the son of Harald Fairhair, no independent evidence supports this genealogical connection. The twelfth-century William of Malmesbury does describe a Norwegian king called Haraldus visiting King Æthelstan of England (d. 939), which is consistent with later saga-traditions in which Harald Fairhair fostered a son, Hákon Aðalsteinsfóstri, on Æthelstan. But William is a late source and &quot;Harald&quot; a far from uncommon name for a Scandinavian character, and William does not give this Harald the epithet &quot;fairhair&quot;, whereas he does give that epithet to the later Norwegian king Haraldr Sigurðarson.
* Although Harald Fairhair appears in diverse Icelandic sagas, few if any of these are independent sources. It is plausible that all these were participating in a shared textual tradition begun by the earliest Icelandic prose account of Harald, Ari Þorgilsson&#x27;s &quot;Íslendingabók&quot;. Dating from the early twelfth century, this was written over 250 years after Harald&#x27;s supposed death.
* The saga evidence is potentially pre-dated by two skaldic poems, &quot;Haraldskvæði&quot; (also known as &quot;Hrafnsmál&quot;) and &quot;Glymdrápa&quot;, which have been attributed to Þorbjörn hornklofi or alternatively (in the case of the first poem) to Þjóðólfr of Hvinir, and are according to the sagas about Harald Fairhair. Although only preserved in thirteenth-century Kings&#x27; sagas, they might have been transmitted orally (as the sagas claim) from the tenth century. The first describes life at the court of a king called Harald, mentions that he took a Danish wife, and that he won a battle at Hafrsfjord. The second poem relates a series of battles won by a king called Harald. However, the information supplied in these poems is inconsistent with the tales in the sagas in which they are transmitted, and the sagas themselves often disagree on the details of his background and biography. Meanwhile, the most reliable manuscripts of &quot;Haraldskvæði&quot; call the poem&#x27;s honorand Haraldr Hálfdanarson rather than Haraldr hárfagri, and &quot;Glymdrápa&quot; offers no epithet at all. All the poems suggest is that there was once a king called Haraldr (Hálfdanarson).
* Sources from the British Isles which are independent of the Icelandic saga-tradition (and partly of each other), and are mostly earlier than the sagas, do attest to a king whose name corresponds to the Old Norse name &quot;Haraldr inn hárfagri&quot;—but they use this name of the well attested Haraldr Sigurðarson (d. 1066, often known in modern English as Harald Hardrada). These sources include manuscript D of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (&#x27;Harold Harfagera&#x27;, under the year 1066) and the related histories by Orderic Vitalis (&#x27;Harafagh&#x27;, re events in 1066), John of Worcester (&#x27;Harvagra&#x27;, s.aa. 1066 and 1098), and William of Malmesbury (&quot;Gesta regum Anglorum&quot;, &#x27;Harvagre&#x27;, s.a. regarding 1066); Marianus Scotus of Mainz (&#x27;Arbach&#x27;, d. 1082/1083); and the &quot;Life&quot; of Gruffydd ap Cynan (&#x27;Haraldum Harfagyr&#x27;, later twelfth century, though this may refer to two different kings by this name).

Scholarly consensus on Harald&#x27;s historicity now falls into two camps. One suggests that the medieval Icelandic and Norwegian historiography of Harald Fairhair is part of an origin myth created to explain the settlement of Iceland, perhaps in which a cognomen of Haraldr Sigurðarson was transferred to a fictitious early king of all Norway. Sverrir Jakobsson has suggested that the idea of Iceland being settled by people fleeing an overbearing Norwegian monarch actually reflects the anxieties of Iceland in the early thirteenth century, when the island was indeed coming under Norwegian dominance. He has also suggested that the legend of Harald Fairhair developed in the twelfth century to enable Norwegian kings, who were then promoting the idea of primogeniture over the older custom of agnatic succession, to claim that their ancestors had had a right to Norway by lineal descent from the country&#x27;s supposed first king.

One possibility advanced is that Harald Fairhair was based on a historical king called Harald, perhaps also known as &quot;hárfagri&quot;, who ruled Vestlandet. The legend of this Harald later grew into the figure of medieval tradition. Historians who accept the early dating of skaldic poetry such as Claus Krag and Hans Jacob Orning tend to accept Harald&#x27;s existence, while remaining skeptical regarding the saga accounts. In 2015, Hans Jacob Orning, building on then-recent archaeology and Krag&#x27;s work, argued that Harald was based in Sogn, an area which the medieval Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson associated with Harald, and which was a centre of power in the ninth century. In the skaldic poetry (which is generally considered authentic ninth-century work by linguists) the estates mentioned match a convenient network of estates with about a day&#x27;s traveling distance between them, which would be ideal for a king ruling in Vestlandet, but not all of Norway. This reading could be consistent with the &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;&#x27;s account. While it is possible that Harald could have controlled other areas through jarls and client kings, this is difficult to prove with available archeology. Krag has noted that Snorri&#x27;s account of Harald&#x27;s origin in Vestfold might have been propaganda as the area of Viken was disputed between the Norwegian and Danish crown in the thirteenth century. Krag points of that Othere describes Viken as Danish territory and Hrafnsmál&#x27;s description of the battle of Hafrsfjord suggest that Harald was attacked by &quot;eastern&quot; enemies that were routed and fled back east. He proposes that the battle was not part of a war of conquest but Harald defending his own territory from invaders. This idea offers a very different reading of the poem where its references to the &quot;dróttin Norðmanna&quot; (&quot;lord of the northmen&quot;) might have originally meant referred to the leader of the Norwegians in the battle, but later recontextualised as the lord of all Norwegians.

==Attestations==
Harald is mentioned in several sagas, some which quotes supposedly older skaldic poetry. If the linguistic dating of the poems are correct, they represent the earliest accounts of Harald Fairhair.

=== &quot;Hrafnsmál&quot; ===

&quot;Hrafnsmál&quot;, also known as &quot;Haraldskvæði&quot;, is a fragmentary skaldic poem generally accepted as being written by the 9th-century skald Þorbjörn Hornklofi. There does not exist a complete copy of the poem, and modern editions of the poem are based on the compilation of the segments. Through dating of the parts as well as the meter is consistent, they may be separate compositions but scholarly consensus is indecisive. Part of the poem is cited by Snorri in Heimskringla as a source for his narrative of the Battle of Hafrsfjord, while another is cited in Fagrskinna as information about Harald. Both credits Hornklofi as the composer.

Hrafnsmál largely consists of a conversation between an unnamed valkyrie and a raven; the two discuss the life and martial deeds of Harald Fairhair. The poem describes Harald as an Yngling, but does not use his famous nickname &quot;hárfagri&quot; (&quot;fairhair&quot;), but uses his widely cited previous nickname &quot;Lufa&quot; . The bulk of the poem seems to describe the Battle of Hafrsfjord, were Harald faced off against Kjotve the Rich and Hakláng. The poem mentions Ragnhild, who in Heimskringla is presented as Harald&#x27;s queen and mother of Eirik Bloodaxe, as well as the following of ulfheðnar warriors that the saga tradition ascribes to Harald.

=== &quot;Glymdrápa&quot; ===

Like Hrafnsmál, Glymdrápa is a praise poem attributed to Þorbjörn Hornklofi about various battles won by Harald. It is dated to the late 9th century, but an exact dating is difficult and due to its fragmentary presentation it may be a compilation of unrelated stanzas. Unlike Hrafnsmál its relation to Harald and the events it supposedly relates to in Heimskringla is ambiguous.

=== &quot;Sendibitr&quot; ===

&quot;Sendibitr&quot;, the last and shortest poem Snorri quotes is attributed to Jórunn skáldmær (Jorunn the skaldmaiden), one of few female poets mentioned in the sagas. It deals with a conflict between Harald and his son Halfdan, identified in Heimskringla as Halfdan the Black (the Younger), Harald&#x27;s son by Åsa Håkonsdottir. Finnur Jónsson dates this poem to the late 10th century. If the dating is correct, it is the first instance of Harald having the epithet &quot;fairhair&quot; (&quot;hárfagra&quot; in the text). However, consensus is that the exact dating is uncertain. It has been suggested that the poem refers to past events, which would mean the poet lived in a later time than the events described in the poem. Linguistic dating of the poem has not been successful.

=== &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; ===
The earliest narrative source which mentions Harald, the twelfth-century &quot;Íslendingabók&quot;, notes that Iceland was settled during his lifetime. Harald is thus depicted as the prime cause of the Norse settlement of Iceland and beyond. Iceland was settled by &quot;malcontents&quot; from Norway, who resented Harald&#x27;s claim of rights of taxation over lands, which the possessors appear to have previously held in absolute ownership. It is the earliest non-skaldic account of Harald to use the nickname &quot;hárfagri&quot;.

=== &quot;Skarðsárbók&quot; ===

The &quot;Skarðsárbók&quot;-version of &quot;Landnámabók&quot; includes a brief narrative of Harald and his background. Harald is here described as the great-grandson of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye through his daughter Áslaug, her son Sigurd Hart and his daughter Ragnhild. The text describes Halfdan the Black&#x27;s death by going through the ice on Randsfjorden, a story also told by Snorri in Heimskringla, and that Harald became king afterwards. He is said to have taken control of Sogn from Atli jarl due to him never paying taxes. This happened before Harald&#x27;s conquest of Norway.

=== &quot;Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum&quot; ===

&quot;Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum&quot; is dated to about 1190. Here Harald is described as having become the first king of all of Norway at the age of 20. It describes a battle in &quot;Hafrsvágr&quot; (as opposed of &quot;Hafrifjord&quot;) against a king called Skeithar-Brandr (&quot;Skeiðar-Brandr&quot;). The text quotes a poem called &quot;&quot;Oddmjór&quot; which describes Harald as a Scylding were as other sources calls him an Yngling. He is described to as having waged wars for 10 years before having conquered all of Norway. He is said to have had 20 children, but that only Eirik Bloodaxe &amp; Hakon the Good becoming kings. In this account, Eirik is described as Harald&#x27;s eldest son and Hakon as the youngest. Only one of Harald&#x27;s wives/concubines is named, Snjófríthr, daughter of Svási (Norwegian: &quot;Svåse&quot;), a beautiful sami-woman. She is described as having died three years after their marriage with Harald mourning for her, but the people mourning for him, considering him bewitched. Eirik is said to have succeeded Harald, ruling for five years, with two as a co-ruler with his father. Hákon eventually supplanted the cruel and oppressive rule of Eirik and his wife Gunnhildr. Hákon is said to be a Christian, but swayed from Christianity due to his unnamed pagan wife and his will to please his people.

=== &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; ===

&quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, which is dated to about 1220, mentions that Iceland was discovered in the time of Harald Fairhair by Ingólfr Arnarson and Hjörleifr Hróðmarsson. The work describes the history of the Yngling-dynasty from the legendary king Ingvi as Harald&#x27;s ancestors and Halfdan the Black was his father. Halfdan is here described as ruling a mountainous region of Norway and having drowned in Rondvatnet. Harald&#x27;s rule is said to have lasted for 73 years and his nickname derived from his beautiful hair. Notably, Harald is here described as being the first to rule the entire coastal region of Norway, as opposed to all of Norway. The interior is described to as having been ruled by petty kings, however, it is said that Harald as good as ruled this region as well.

This account describes Eirik Bloodaxe as the oldest son of Harald, unlike in Heimskringla. Hákon is not referred to as &quot;the good&quot; and is Harald&#x27;s second son, not his youngest. This account of Hákon suggest that he did not accept Christianity. Like the later Heimskringla, Ragnvald Rettilbeine is described as killed on Harald&#x27;s orders. In Heimskringla he is burned alive by Eirik Bloodaxe, while Historia Norwegiæ describes Ragnvald as being drowned.

===&quot;Fagrskinna&quot;===

&quot;Fagrskinna&quot; is thought to have been written around 1220 and is a catalogue of the kings of Norway. The first part describes Harald Fairhair&#x27;s birth ancestry in form of his paternal grandfather Gudrød the Hunter and maternal grandfather Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, and his parents Halfdan the Black and Ragnhildr. The text also describes Halfdan having another son called Harald by another woman named Ragnhildr, daughter of the king Harald Goldbeard of Sogn. Halfdan&#x27;s first Harald inherited Sogn after the death of Harald Goldbeard, and then died himself. Halfdan then inherited Sogn from his first son. The story is repeated by Snorri in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and suggests two conflicting stories of Harald&#x27;s ancestry being combined into one. Harald Fairhair is said to have inherited Halfdan&#x27;s lands at a young age after the king drowned in the lake Rǫnd in Rykinsvik. The text then sites the poem &quot;Hrafnsmál&quot; at length as an example of Harald&#x27;s nobility and prowess in battle. Harald appointed Atli the Slender as jarl of Fjaler, but that the two fell out. In this time Harald meet jarl Håkon Grjotgardsson (called &quot;Hákon the Old&quot; in the text) at a feast in Hladir (&quot;Lade&quot;) in Trondheim and gave him part of Atli&#x27;s fief. Atli defended his old area with violence and both of the jarls were killed. Harald proclaimed he would not cut his hair until having become overlord of Norway and earning tribute from every inland valley and outlying headland, earning him the nickname &quot;Lufa&quot;&quot;, &quot;shockhead&quot;. Harald is said to have fought many battles, including a decisive battle in Hafrfjord against Kjotve the Rich and Haklang. After this battle, all of Norway is said to paid tribute to Harald. Ragnvald jarl then cut Harald&#x27;s hair and gave him the nickname &quot;Fairhair&quot;.

The text then described Harald&#x27;s various sons, describing Eirik Bloodaxe as his most beloved and one of his oldest. Harald named Eirik his heir and died in Rogaland from old age and was buried in Haugesund.

=== &quot;Heimskringla&quot; ===
In the &quot;Saga of Harald Fairhair&quot; in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (written around 1230), which is the most elaborate although not the oldest or most reliable source to the life of Harald, it is written that Harald succeeded, on the death of his father Halfdan the Black Gudrödarson in Rondvatnet, to the sovereignty of several small, and somewhat scattered kingdoms in Vestfold, which had come into his father&#x27;s hands through conquest and inheritance. His protector-regent was his mother&#x27;s brother duke Guthorm. He is described as the descendant of the Yngling-dynasty, whose history is described earlier in the work.

The unification of Norway is something of a love story. It begins with a marriage proposal that resulted in rejection and scorn from Gyda, the daughter of Eirik, king of Hordaland. She said she refused to marry Harald &quot;before he was king over all of Norway&quot;. Harald was therefore induced to take a vow not to cut nor comb his hair until he was &quot;&quot; (&quot;people-king&quot;) of Norway, and when he was justified in trimming it ten years later, he exchanged the epithet &quot;&quot; or &quot;Tanglehair&quot; (Haraldr lúfa) for the one by which he is usually known.

In 866, Harald made the first of a series of conquests over the many petty kingdoms which would compose all of Norway, including Värmland in Sweden, which had sworn allegiance to the Swedish saga-king Erik Eymundsson (whose historicity is not confirmed). Marching up through the Uplands and into Trondheim and then south along the coast Harald subdued many petty kings. Snorri credits his success to excellent leadership by him and his uncle Guthorm, as well as military reforms and his hard tax policy. The taxes demanded by Harald were much higher than other kings and a third of the revenues were given to his jarls. This made jarls and rich farmers flock to his cause to enrich themself. One of these was Håkon Grjotgardsson of Trondheim who allied with Harald and married off his daughter Åsa to him. Harald established the royal estate of Hlade in Trondheim and Håkon became the first of the Earls of Lade, a family which would be one of the dominating forces in Norway for the next 150 years. Harald&#x27;s third principal ally was Rognvald Eysteinsson, jarl of Møre. Snorri describes Rognvald as Harald&#x27;s closest friend and the one to coin the name &quot;Fairhair&quot;. Harald is said to have fathered Bjørn Farmann and Olav Geirstadalv with Rognvald&#x27;s sister Svanhild, ancestors of the famous Christian kings Olav Tryggvason (named after his grandfather Olav Geirstadalv) and Olav the Holy.

In 872, after a great victory at Hafrsfjord near Stavanger against Kjotve the Rich, Harald found himself king over the whole country, ruling from his Kongsgård seats at Avaldsnes and Alrekstad. His realm was, however, threatened by dangers from without, as large numbers of his opponents had taken refuge, not only in Iceland, then recently discovered; but also in the Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides Islands, Faroe Islands and the northern European mainland. However, his opponents&#x27; leaving was not entirely voluntary. Many Norwegian chieftains who were wealthy and respected posed a threat to Harald; therefore, they were subjected to much harassment from Harald, prompting them to vacate the land. At last, Harald was forced to make an expedition to the West, to clear the islands and the Scottish mainland of some Vikings who tried to hide there.

Snorri describes Harald&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of Svási, here called Snæfrithr, but in his account they are described as jötnar rather than finns (sami). Gyda is said to have been made a &quot;friðla&quot; (concubine) of Harald after her father Eirik of Hordaland had been killed in battle by Harald&#x27;s followers. Harald is said to have divorced Åsa and rejected Gyda and several other concubines to marry a Jutish princess called Ragnhild the Mighty. The couple only had one child, Eirik Bloodaxe, before her premature death. Eirik Bloodaxe was named after Ragnhild&#x27;s father as was custom in medieval Scandinavia. Likely due to Eirik Bloodaxe royal mother, he was favored above Harald&#x27;s other sons. Eirik himself had an unquestioning, near psychopathic loyalty to Harald. Unlike other authors, Snorri does not attribute Eirik&#x27;s cruelty solely to Gunnhild. When Harald and Snæfrith&#x27;s son Ragnvald Rettilbeine became known as patron of sorcerers and a practitioner of magic, Harald ordered him to cease such activity. When Ragnvald did not listen Harald sent Eirik Bloodaxe to murder him. Eirik had his half-brother and all of his sorcerers burned in their hall. When Bjørn Farmann was killed in a conflict with Eirik, Harald stepped in on Eirik&#x27;s side against his other sons.

There are several accounts of large feasting mead halls constructed for important feasts when Scandinavian royalty was invited. The Värmlandish chieftain Áki (Swedish &quot;Åke jarl&quot;) invited both king Harald Fairhair and the Swedish saga-king Erik Eymundsson, but had the Norwegian king stay in the newly constructed and sumptuous one, because he was the youngest one of the kings and the one who had the greatest prospects. The older Swedish king, on the other hand, had to stay in the old feasting hall. The Swedish king was so humiliated that he killed Áki. Harald drove Erik Eymundsson out of Värmland and inserted Áki&#x27;s son Ubbi (Swedish: &quot;Ubbe&quot;) as jarl. Harald is then said to have made a punitive raid into Västra Götaland, to weaken Erik Eymundsson.

As Harald&#x27;s sons came of age their unruly behavior became a source of instability in Norway. Snæfrith&#x27;s sons Halfdan Long-Leg and Gudrød Ljome burned Rognvald jarl alive in his hall and took his lands in More and Orkney. Halfdan Long-Legs was killed on Orkney by Rognvald&#x27;s son Torf-Einarr and Gudrød was brought to justice by Harald. The estates in Møre are returned to Rognvald&#x27;s other son Thorir the Silent who was given Harald&#x27;s daughter Ålov in marriage as compensation. A variation of this story also appears in &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;. Afterwards, Gudrød was kept in Harald&#x27;s hird, in a position where Harald could prevent him from similar transgressions.

The account describes Hákon the good as Harald&#x27;s youngest son, through a servant named Thora.

=== &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot; ===

The thirteenth-century &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot; presents a broadly similar account to that of &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, though its depiction of Harald and his family is much more negative. It has been suggested that &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot; share Snorri Sturluson as author, or at least share a common source. Given the difference in attitude to the royal family and information regarding Erik Bloodaxe&#x27;s family, the latter seems more likely. Through the name Harald Fairhair appears, he is mostly irreverently referred to as Haraldr lúfa. Chapter 3 and 4 tells of Harald&#x27;s conquest of Norway. It repeats Snorri&#x27;s story of Harald&#x27;s vow not to cut his hair until he had become king of all of Norway, but no mention is made of Gyda. Harald is said to have first conquered the Uplands and then taken Trondheim and become overlord over the thronds. This accounts differs from &quot;Heimskringla&quot; where it is said that Harald made a marriage alliance with Håkon Grjotgardsson which won him Trøndelag after they together defeated the petty kings there. The saga then relates the story of the brothers Herlaug and Hrollaug, kings of Namdalen. When Herlaug heard Harald was coming he committed suicide by closing himself into a mound with 12 men. Hrollaug renounced his kingship and took the title of jarl instead. Harald accepted Hrollaug&#x27;s surrender and allowed him to rule Namdalen in his name. This story is also present in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. After this, Namdalen and Hålogaland were in his grasp. The saga then related how Harald did battle with the combined forces of kings Audbjörn of Firðafylki, Solvi Bandy-legs of Møre og Romsdal and Arnvid of Sunnmøre. They were all defeated in battle by Harald, with only Solvi escaping with his life to live the rest of his life as a roving Viking. The remaining independent rulers of Norway were then crushed by Harald&#x27;s allies or opportunists that attacked their neighbors and then submitted to Harald like Hrollaug had done. The saga tells how people of Norway were then put under heavy taxes and oppression by Harald. Anyone suspected of wanting to rise in rebellion were given the option of fleeing the country, submitting himself as a tenant or having hands and feet cut off. According to the saga author, most who were given this option chose to flee. Harald is supposed to have confiscated massive amounts of private property and made many previously free farmers his thralls. Four sons of Harald are mentioned in the saga: Eirikr Bloodaxe (one of the saga&#x27;s major antagonists), Hákon Aðalsteinsfóstri (otherwise called &quot;the Good&quot;), Olaf and &quot;Sigurðr&quot; (whose name is otherwise usually rendered as &quot;Sigröðr&quot;). The saga renders Harald&#x27;s title as &quot;einváldskonungr&quot; (&quot;absolute king&quot;).

=== &quot;Grettis saga&quot; ===

Not unlike &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot;, Harald&#x27;s conquest of Norway sets off the plot of &quot;Grettis saga&quot;. Gretti&#x27;s great-grandfather Önundr Wood-foot is said to be one of many people that fled Norway after fighting for king Kjotvi the Rich and Thorir Haklang in the battle of Hafrsfjord. The saga describes how Harald and his elite Úlfhèðnar warriors (famously mentioned in Hrafnsmál) fought and killed Thorir Haklang when he went berserk. Önundr got his name after his leg was crushed beneath the knee by the prow of one of the king&#x27;s ships and he had to walk on a wooden pegleg for the rest of his life.

=== &quot;Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok&quot; ===

The 13th century &quot;Ragnars saga loðbrókar ok sona hans&quot; (&quot;Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok and his sons&quot;) mentions Harald Fairhair in chapter 18 as the great-great-grandson of Sigurd Hart through his daughter Aslaug, her son Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye and his daughter Ragnhild.

=== &quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot; ===

Harald&#x27;s maternal ancestry is elaborated upon in the final chapter of the 14th century &quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot;. Harald&#x27;s mother is said to have been Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter, who according to the saga was the great-granddaughter of Sigurd through her mother Inibjorg and he grandmother Aslaug. This story is the same as in Snorri&#x27;s earlier &quot;Hálfdanar saga svarta&quot; in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, but contradicts &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;. Both &quot;Hálfdanar saga svarta&quot; and &quot;Ragnarssona þáttr&quot; have issues with the traditional dating of the saga events. The marriage of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye and Blaeja could not have occurred earlier than 867, which would put the dating Harald&#x27;s ascension to kingship of Norway in 872 into question. &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; makes no mention of Blaeja and states that Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter was Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye&#x27;s daughter and not his great-granddaughter, which seems more plausible in regards to the dating of events.

===&quot;Flóamanna saga&quot;===

&quot;Flóamanna saga&quot; is traditionally thought of as a 14th-century work and repeats the story of Harald Fairhair&#x27;s ancestry as told in &quot;Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok&quot;, and elaborates back to Sigurd Fafnisbani and Odin through Aslaug. In old Norse society, the ancestry of both parents was considered of imperance for the status of a person. The saga relates the conflict between Atli the Slender and Håkon Grjotgardsson and their deaths. Håkon&#x27;s son Sigurd Haakonsson advised Harald to kill Atli&#x27;s son Hallstein which lead to Hallstein&#x27;s exile in Iceland.

===&quot;Vatnsdæla saga&quot;===

In &quot;Vatnsdæla saga&quot; Harald&#x27;s conquest of Norway is described. The saga&#x27;s initial protagonist Ingimundr recognises that Harald will prevail at Hafrfjord and arranges a meeting with Harald, Ragnvald Mörejarl and their ulfhednar-warriors. Ingimundr offers his loyalty to Harald which Harald graciously accepts, but Ingimundr is suspicious of the king and he and his friend Sæmundr emigrate to Iceland. Harald wins an extrodinary victory at Hafrfjord and makes Ragnvald a jarl.

=== &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; ===

The &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; likely dates to in the early thirteenth century and belongs to belongs to the genre of &quot;Kings&#x27; Sagas&quot; within Icelandic saga literature, a group of histories of the kings of Norway. It describes in more detail the expedition of Harald Fairhair and Rognvald Mørejarl on an expedition to clear the islands of the Viking refugees of from Harald&#x27;s conquest of Norway that raided the coast. During the expedition Rognvald&#x27;s son Ivar was killed so Harald gave governorship of the islands to him. Rognvald wanted to stay in his home in Møre so he passed the jarlship of the Islands to his brother Sigurd. The saga is informed by the Norwegian politics of the day. Once, historians could write that no-one denied the reality of Harald Fairhair&#x27;s expeditions to the west (recounted in detail in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;), but this is no longer the case. Thomson (2008) writes that Harald&#x27;s &quot;great voyage is so thoroughly ingrained in popular and scholarly history, both ancient and modern, that it comes as a bit of a shock to realise that it might not be true.&quot; The Norwegian contest with the Kings of Scots over the Hebrides and the Isle of Man in the mid 13th century is the backdrop to the saga writer&#x27;s intentions and in part at least the sagas aim to legitimise Norwegian claims to both the Northern Isles and the Kingdom of the Isles in the west.

===&quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;===

The fourteenth-century &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; features a Þáttr called &quot;Haralds þáttr hárfagra&quot;, literary &quot;Harald Fairhair&#x27;s Þáttr&quot;. The first chapter describes Harald&#x27;s ascension to the throne at the age of sixteen, in contrast to other accounts which gives the age of ten. He is here given the otherwise unknown nickname &quot;Dofrafostri&quot; (&quot;Dovre-fostered&quot;). Harald&#x27;s maternal uncle Guthormr is described as his duke and most important ally. Harald&#x27;s war with Gandalf Alfgeirsson and his neighboring kings is described as in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, through in less detail. Following this Harald&#x27;s marriage to Gyda is described and his conquest of Norway. Unlike &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; clearly states that the two were married. Harald&#x27;s further marriages are described as is his rejections of them and his various concubines in favor of Ragnhild the Mighty. The Þáttr concludes with a description of the fates of Harald&#x27;s various sons, including Thorgils&#x27; and Frodi&#x27;s career as &quot;west-vikings&quot;.

===Later life===

According to the saga sources, the latter part of Harald&#x27;s reign was disturbed by the strife of his many sons. The number of sons he left varies in the different saga accounts, from 11 to 20. Twelve of his sons are named as kings, two of them ruled over the whole of Norway. He gave them all the royal title and assigned lands to them, which they were to govern as his representatives; but this arrangement did not put an end to the discord, which continued into the next reign. When he grew old, Harald handed over the supreme power to his favourite son Eirik Bloodaxe, whom he intended to be his successor. Eirik I ruled side by side with his father when Harald was 80 years old. In the Gray Goose Laws, a person above the age of 80 was not allowed to make financial decisions or decisions about inheritance. This co-rulership likely reflected similar laws and would also been way for Harald to force his intended succession. Harald died three years later due to old age in approximately 933.

Harald Harfager was commonly stated to have been buried under a mound at Haugar by the Strait of Karmsund near the church in Haugesund, an area that later would be named the town and municipal Haugesund. The area near Karmsund was the traditional burial site for several early Norwegian rulers. The national monument of Haraldshaugen was raised in 1872, to commemorate the Battle of Hafrsfjord which is traditionally dated to 872.

==Issue==

While the various sagas name anywhere from 11 to 20 sons of Harald in various contexts, the contemporary skaldic poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; says that Harald&#x27;s son Håkon would meet only &quot;eight brothers&quot; when arriving in Valhalla, a place for slain warriors, kings, and Germanic heroes. Only the following five names of sons can be confirmed from skaldic poems (with saga claims in parentheses), while the full number of sons remains unknown:
* Eric Bloodaxe (by Ragnhild Eiriksdotter from Jutland, Denmark)
* Håkon the Good (by Tora Mosterstong from Moster, Sunnhordland, Norway)
* Ragnvald
* Bjørn (Bjørn Farmann?)
* Halvdan, possibly two by that name

==In popular culture==
===In Norway===
Harald Fairhair became an important figure in Norwegian nationalism in the nineteenth century, during its struggle for independence from Sweden, when he served as &#x27;a heroic narrative character disseminating a foundation story of Norway becoming an independent nation&#x27;. In particular, a national monument to Harald was erected in 1872 on Haraldshaugen, an ancient burial mound at the town of Haugesund then imagined to be Harald Finehair&#x27;s burial place, despite opposition from left-wing politicians. The German historian Jan Rüdiger concluded that: 

The claim to Harald has become important to the development of the tourism industry of Haugesund and its region:

In 2013, commercially led archaeological excavations at Avaldsnes began with the explicit intention of developing the local heritage industry in relation to the Harald Fairhair brand, provoking a prominent debate in Norway over the appropriate handling of archaeological heritage.

<text>A lieutenant governor, lieutenant-governor, or vice governor is a high officer of state, whose precise role and rank vary by jurisdiction. Often a lieutenant governor is the deputy, or lieutenant, to or ranked under a governor — a &quot;second-in-command&quot;, rather like deputy governor. In Canadian provinces and in the Dutch Caribbean, the lieutenant governor is the representative of the Canadian monarch or Dutch monarch in that jurisdiction, and thus outranks the head of government, but for practical purposes has virtually no power.

In India, lieutenant governors are in charge of union territories in that country.

In the United States, lieutenant governors are usually second-in-command to a state governor, and the actual power held by the lieutenant governor varies greatly from state to state. The lieutenant governor is often first in line of succession to the governorship, and acts as governor when the governor leaves the state or is unable to serve. Also, the lieutenant governor is often the president of the state senate.

In Argentina, lieutenant governors are called &quot;vice governors&quot; and are modeled after the U.S. lieutenant governors, since as their U.S. counterpart the vice governors are the second-in-command to a provincial governor, and are the first in the gubernatorial line of succession. Also, the vice governor usually acts as the president of the provincial senate (or the provincial legislature in unicameral provinces).

==Lieutenant governors in the Kingdom of the Netherlands==
The Netherlands has lieutenant governors () who formerly and currently govern the Netherland&#x27;s island territories. Before the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, each island territory of the Netherlands Antilles had a lieutenant governor who served as heads of the governing council of each island territory, which formed a level of decentralized government. Currently, the Netherlands has three lieutenant governors who each oversee one of the three special municipalities in the Caribbean Netherlands: Saba, Bonaire, and Sint Eustatius. These lieutenant governors are referred to locally as Island Governor, and their function is similar to a mayor in the European Netherlands.

<doc id="56253" wikidata="Q242009" url="?curid=56253" title="Celtic knot">
<text>Celtic knots (, , , ) are a variety of knots and stylized graphical representations of knots used for decoration, used extensively in the Celtic style of Insular art. These knots are most known for their adaptation for use in the ornamentation of Christian monuments and manuscripts, such as the 8th-century St. Teilo Gospels, the Book of Kells and the Lindisfarne Gospels. Most are endless knots, and many are varieties of basket weave knots.

== History ==
The use of interlace patterns had its origins in the late Roman Empire. Knot patterns first appeared in the third and fourth centuries AD and can be seen in Roman floor mosaics of that time. Interesting developments in the artistic use of interlaced knot patterns are found in Byzantine architecture and book illumination, Coptic art, Celtic art, Islamic art, Kievan Rus&#x27; book illumination, Ethiopian art, and European architecture and book illumination.

Spirals, step patterns, and key patterns are dominant motifs in Celtic art before the Christian influence on the Celts, which began around 450. These designs found their way into early Christian manuscripts and artwork with the addition of depictions from life, such as animals, plants and even humans. In the beginning, the patterns were intricate interwoven cords, called plaits, which can also be found in other areas of Europe, such as Italy, in the 6th century. A fragment of a Gospel Book, now in the Durham Cathedral library and created in northern Britain in the 7th century, contains the earliest example of true knotted designs in the Celtic manner.

Examples of plait work (a woven, unbroken cord design) predate knotwork designs in several cultures around the world, but the broken and reconnected plait work that is characteristic of true knotwork began in northern Italy and southern Gaul and spread to Ireland by the 7th century. The style is most commonly associated with the Celtic lands, but it was also practiced extensively in England and was exported to Europe by Irish and Northumbrian monastic activities on the continent. J. Romilly Allen has identified &quot;eight elementary knots which form the basis of nearly all the interlaced patterns in Celtic decorative art&quot;.

The Celtic knot as a tattoo design became popular in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.

<text>A Paschal candle is a large candle used in liturgies in Western Christianity (viz., the Roman Catholic Church, the Lutheran Churches, the Anglican Communion, and the Methodist Churches, among others). A new Paschal candle is blessed and lit every year at Easter. It is used throughout the Eastertide and then throughout the year on occasions such as baptisms, funerals and some other special occasions such as the ordination of priests, taking vows or the Consecration of virgins, when the fire from the Paschal candle is carried with a wick to light another liturgical candle, as for example the baptismal candle.

The equivalent of the Paschal candle in the Eastern Orthodox Church is the Paschal trikirion, which differs in both style and usage.

== Etymology==
The term &quot;Paschal&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;Pascha&quot;, which came from the Hebrew word &quot;Pesach (; פֶּסַח)&quot;, meaning Passover, and relates to the Paschal mystery of salvation. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Easter candle&quot; or the &quot;Christ candle&quot;.

== Description ==

For congregations that use a Paschal candle, it is the largest candle in the worship space. In most cases, the candle will display several common symbols:
# The cross, which is the most prominent symbol and most clearly identifies it as the Paschal candle
# The Greek letters alpha and omega, which symbolize that God is the beginning and the end (from the Book of Revelation)
# The numerals of the current year between the arms of the cross
# Five grains of incense, which are embedded in the candle (usually encased in red or golden wax &quot;nails&quot;). The &quot;nails&quot; represent the Five Holy Wounds: the three nails that pierced Christ&#x27;s hands and feet, the spear thrust into his side to wound his heart, and the thorns that crowned his head. The grains of incense are to recall the aromatic spices that were used to prepare Christ&#x27;s body for the tomb.

In the (medieval) Church, Paschal candles often reached a stupendous size. The Paschal candle of Salisbury Cathedral was said to have been tall. At present time, in the United States and Southern Europe (e.g., Italy and France) the candle is approximately in diameter and tall; in Northern Europe the candle tends to be shorter in height () and wider in diameter (). The Paschal candle of Manila Cathedral usually reaches and stands at tall.

The Paschal candle, like all liturgical candles, must be made at least from the most part of beeswax &quot;(ex cera apum saltem in maxima parte)&quot;. The Church Fathers saw the bee as a symbol of the Virgin Mary. The beeswax symbolized the pure flesh of Christ, received from his mother.

== Usage ==
=== Easter Vigil ===
For churches that celebrate the Easter Vigil on the night of Holy Saturday, the ceremonial preparation, dedication and lighting of the Paschal candle is one of the most solemn moments of the service. The Easter Vigil liturgies of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches are nearly identical.

On Maundy Thursday of the same week the entire church is darkened by extinguishing all candles and lamps. This and the empty tabernacle symbolise the darkness of a world without Christ.

At the opening of the Easter Vigil a fire is lit and blessed. The minister will cuts a cross in the wax with a stylus and trace the symbols on the Paschal candle, saying words similar to: &quot;Christ, yesterday and today, the Beginning and the End, the Alpha and the Omega. All time belongs to him and all the ages; to him be glory and power through every age for ever. Amen.&quot; He then inserts five grains of incense (reminiscent of the nails used to fasten Christ on the Cross) on the five points of the cross, saying: &quot;By his holy and glorious wounds, may Christ our Lord guard us and keep us. Amen.&quot;

The Paschal candle is the first candle to be lit with a flame from this sacred fire, representing the light of Christ coming into the world. This represents the risen Christ, as a symbol of light (life) dispelling darkness (death). Before it is lit, the minister says words similar to: &quot;May the light of Christ, rising in glory, dispel the darkness of our hearts and minds.&quot;
Typically, the worshiping assembly then processes into the church led by the Paschal candle. The candle is raised three times during the procession, accompanied by the chant &quot;The light of Christ&quot; to which the assembly responds &quot;Thanks be to God&quot;.

In some communities, it is common for nearby churches of different Christian denominations (e.g. Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian) to make the new Easter Fire together and then after this, each congregation processes back to their own church with their own Paschal Candle for their Easter Vigil celebration; this is considered to be a fostering of ecumenism.

Following the procession the &quot;Exultet&quot; is chanted, traditionally by a deacon, but it may be chanted by the priest or – most parts of it – by a cantor. The &quot;Exultet&quot; concludes with the offering of the candle:

From the Roman Missal:

On this, your night of grace, O holy father, accept this candle, a solemn offering, the work of bees and of your servants&#x27; hands, an evening sacrifice of praise, this gift from your most holy Church. But now we know the praises of this pillar, which glowing fire ignites for God&#x27;s honor, a fire into many flames divided, yet never dimmed by sharing of its light, for it is fed by melting wax, drawn out by mother bees to build a torch so precious. O truly blessed night, when things of heaven are wed to those of earth, and divine to the human. Therefore, O Lord, we pray you that this candle, hallowed to the honor of your name, may persevere undimmed, to overcome the darkness of this night. Receive it as a pleasing fragrance, and let it mingle with the lights of heaven. May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your son, who, coming back from death&#x27;s domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever.
After the Litany of the Saints, the Paschal candle is lowered three times into the Easter water to be blessed while the priest sings a prayer of blessing with the request for the descent of the Holy Spirit. In some Eastern traditions, wax is dripped into the water for an even richer symbolism.

=== Other times of the year ===
The candle remains in the sanctuary close to the altar and is lit at least in all the more solemn worship services until Pentecost (or in some traditions until Ascension Day when it is extinguished just after the Gospel). In this context the Paschal candle symbolises the presence of the glorified risen Christ.

After Eastertide, the candle should be kept in the baptistry, so that in the celebrations of baptisms the candles of the baptized may be lit from the candle. The Paschal candle is lit during baptisms to signify the Holy Spirit and fire that John the Baptist promised to those who were baptised in Christ.

Before 1955, the option existed of blessing the baptismal font on the Vigil of Pentecost, and this was the only time the Paschal candle would be lit at services after Ascension. In the Ordinary form of the Roman Rite, the Paschal candle is lit and should be placed near the coffin during the Mass of the repose of the soul or the Requiem. This is to indicate that the death of a Christian is his own passover.

==Eastern usage==

In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, there is no direct correspondence to the Western Paschal candle. However, throughout Bright Week, the priest carries a cross and paschal trikirion at all of the services, especially when censing, during the Little Entrance or when giving the Paschal greeting. The trikirion consists of three lit candles in a candlestick, which the priest carries in his left hand. In the Slavic tradition, the three candles may be white or different colors: green, red, blue. The deacon also carries a special Paschal candle which is a single large candle whenever he leads an ektenia (litany) or censes.

<text>Aardman Animations Limited is a British animation studio based in Bristol. It is known for films and television series made using stop motion and clay animation techniques, particularly those featuring its plasticine characters from &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot;,
&quot;Chicken Run&quot;, &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot;, and &quot;Morph&quot;. After some experimental computer-animated short films during the late 1990s, beginning with &quot;Owzat&quot; (1997), Aardman entered the computer animation market with &quot;Flushed Away&quot; (2006). As of February 2020, it had earned $1.1 billion worldwide, with an average $135.6 million per film. Between 2000 and 2006, Aardman partnered with DreamWorks Animation.

Aardman&#x27;s films have been consistently well received, and their stop-motion films are among the highest-grossing produced, with their 2000 debut, &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, being their top-grossing film, as well as the highest-grossing stop-motion film of all time. A sequel, &quot;Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget&quot;, was released in 2023.

==History==
===1972–1996===

Aardman was founded in 1972 as a low-budget project by Peter Lord and David Sproxton, who wanted to realise their dream of producing an animated motion picture. The partnership provided animated sequences for the BBC series for deaf children &quot;Vision On&quot;. The company name originates from the name of their nerdish Superman character in that series. The process of using clay animation to produce a segment called &quot;Gleebees&quot; (1975) became the inspiration for creating Morph, a simple clay character. Around the same time, Lord and Sproxton made their first foray into adult animation with the shorts &quot;Down and Out&quot; and &quot;Confessions of a Foyer Girl&quot;, entries in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Animated Conversations&quot; series using real-life conversations as soundtracks.

Aardman also created the title sequence for &quot;The Great Egg Race&quot; and supplied animation for the multiple award-winning music video of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s song &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;. They produced the music video for the song &quot;My Baby Just Cares For Me&quot; by Nina Simone in 1987. Also in the 1980s, they created the trombone-playing character &quot;Douglas&quot; in a television commercial for Lurpak butter.

Later Aardman produced a number of shorts for Channel 4, including the &quot;Conversation Pieces&quot; series. These five shorts worked in the same area as the &quot;Animated Conversations&quot; pieces, but were more sophisticated. Lord and Sproxton began hiring more animators at this point; three of the newcomers made their directorial debut at Aardman with the &quot;Lip Synch&quot; series. Of the five &quot;Lip Synch&quot; shorts, two were directed by Lord, one by Barry Purves, one by Richard Goleszowski and one by Nick Park.

In 1990, Park&#x27;s short, &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;, was the first Aardman production to win an Academy Award. Park also developed the clay modelled shorts featuring the adventures of Wallace &amp; Gromit, a comical pair of friends: Wallace being a naive English inventor with a love of cheese, and Gromit his best friend, the intelligent but silent dog. These films include &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; (1989), &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; (1993) and &quot;A Close Shave&quot; (1995), the latter two winning Academy Awards.

===1997–2007===
In December 1997, Aardman, DreamWorks (later DreamWorks Animation) and Pathé announced that their companies were teaming up to co-finance and distribute &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, Aardman&#x27;s first feature film, which had already been in pre-production for a year. On 27 October 1999, Aardman and DreamWorks signed a $250 million deal to make an additional four films that were estimated to be completed during the next 12 years. Along with the deal their first project was announced, titled &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot;. Intended to be based on Aesop&#x27;s fable and directed by Richard Goleszowski, it was paused two years later because of script problems. On 23 June 2000, &quot;Chicken Run&quot; was released to a great critical and financial success. In 2005, after ten years of absence, Wallace and Gromit returned in Academy Award-winning &quot;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;. The following year &quot;Flushed Away&quot;, Aardman&#x27;s first computer-animated feature, was released.

On 10 October 2005, a serious fire at a storage facility used by Aardman and other Bristol-based companies destroyed over 30 years of props, models, and scenery often built by the Bristol-based Cod Steaks. This warehouse was used for storage of past projects and so did not prevent the production of their current projects at the time. In addition, the company&#x27;s library of finished films was stored elsewhere and was undamaged. An electrical fault was determined to be the cause of the blaze. Referring to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, Park was quoted as saying, &quot;Even though it is a precious and nostalgic collection and valuable to the company, in light of other tragedies, today isn&#x27;t a big deal.&quot;

On 1 October 2006, right before the release of &quot;Flushed Away&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that due to creative differences, DreamWorks Animation and Aardman had decided to end their contract. The deal was officially terminated on 30 January 2007. According to an Aardman spokesperson: &quot;The business model of DreamWorks no longer suits Aardman and vice versa. But the split couldn&#x27;t have been more amicable.&quot; Unofficial reasons for departure were weak performances of the last two movies, for which DreamWorks had to take writedowns, and citing the article, &quot;Aardman executives chafed at the creative control DreamWorks tried to exert, particularly with &quot;Flushed Away&quot;...&quot; The studio had another film in development, &quot;Crood Awakening&quot; (eventually &quot;The Croods&quot;), which had been announced in 2005, with John Cleese co-writing the screenplay. With the end of the partnership, the film&#x27;s rights reverted to DreamWorks.

From 2006 to 2007, the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan, had an exhibit featuring the works of Aardman Studios. Sproxton and Lord visited the exhibit in May 2006 and met with animator Hayao Miyazaki during the visit. Miyazaki has long been a fan of Aardman Animations&#x27; works.

===2007–2012===
In April 2007, Aardman signed and in 2010 renewed a three-year deal with Sony Pictures to finance, co-produce and distribute feature films. The next year, Aardman released a new &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; short film called &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot;. The first film made in partnership with Sony was the computer-animated &quot;Arthur Christmas&quot; (2011), Aardman&#x27;s first 3D feature film. 2012 saw the release of &quot;The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!&quot; (known internationally in America as &quot;The Pirates! Band of Misfits&quot;), Aardman&#x27;s first 3D stop-motion film and Lord&#x27;s first film as a director since &quot;Chicken Run&quot;. Two additional films were announced in June 2007: &quot;The Cat Burglars&quot;, a stop-motion animated heist comedy film directed by Steve Box, about cat burglars that steal milk and their plans to pull off &#x27;the great milk float robbery&#x27;; and an untitled Nick Park project (which would later become &quot;Early Man&quot;).

The studio is also known to provide generous resources and training to young animators by providing awards at various animation festivals. For example, The Aardman Award at the UK&#x27;s Animex Festival in Teesside provides story consultation to a promising young animator for their next film.

In 2008, Aardman joined with Channel 4 and Lupus Films to launch a user-generated content animation portal called 4mations. They also designed the BBC One Christmas Idents for that year, which featured Wallace and Gromit to tie in with the showing of the new Wallace and Gromit film called &quot;A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot; on Christmas Day at 8:30pm. In April 2008, Aardman launched the Aardman YouTube channel, which is a YouTube Partner channel featuring the entire &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; TV series, the Morph series, &quot;Cracking Contraptions&quot; and clips from the Wallace and Gromit films. From December 2008, Aardman also started posting various flash games on Newgrounds, the majority of which are based on &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; and &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot;.

In 2009, Nintendo announced that Aardman would make twelve short films using only Flipnote Studio. The films were posted on Flipnote&#x27;s Hatena web service provider. The first film was called &quot;The Sandwich Twins&quot; and was released on 16 September 2009. The remaining eleven films were released on a weekly basis until Christmas, and can also be downloaded using Hatena. In the same year, the headquarters of the studio moved into a new building, designed by Alec French architects, in Gas Ferry Road, Bristol, although work needing large-scale sets is still carried out in sheds in Aztec West and Bedminster. In April 2009, Aardman Animations edited the existing Watch identity by UKTV to make the inflatable eyeball (called &quot;Blinky&quot;) in the idents blink.

===2013–2019===
In October 2013, Lord (co-founder of Aardman Animations) created a fundraising project on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter. The campaign has a target of £75,000 which would be used to fund 12 new one-minute episodes of Morph. Lord was hoping to start production in January 2014 using the original stop-frame animation. Backers of the project would receive a variety of rewards, including early access to the new animations and a small box of clay used in the production, depending on the individual&#x27;s level of funding.

In 2015, the studio bought a majority share in New York-based animation studio Nathan Love, announcing the merger with a short film called &quot;Introducing: Aardman Nathan Love&quot; on 25 September of the same year of that being that the British stop-motion animated series &quot;Digby Dragon&quot; debuted on Nick Jr. UK in 2016.

In advance of Aardman&#x27;s fortieth anniversary, the BBC One channel aired the one-hour television documentary &quot;A Grand Night In: The Story of Aardman&quot;, first broadcast in December 2015. Narrated by Julie Walters, this career retrospective includes commentary by the company&#x27;s founders and staff, as well as various friends, fans and colleagues including Terry Gilliam, John Lasseter, and Matt Groening.

From 29 June 2017 to 29 October 2017, an exhibition entitled &quot;Wallace and Gromit and Friends&quot; was shown at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) in Melbourne. A report on this exhibition was shown on Australian &quot;ABC News Breakfast&quot; on Wednesday, 28 June, featuring an eight-minute interview with producers Lord and Sproxton. The exhibition revealed that in Park&#x27;s very early sketches, Gromit was originally a cat, but Park soon changed him into a dog, since it was generally agreed that a dog was clearly more suitable as a loyal pet/companion than a cat and also because a dog would be easier to make and animate in Plasticine. Embedded in the ABC News article is a video interview with Lord and Sproxton, which gives information not only on Wallace and Gromit, but also Shaun the Sheep and others.

On 9 November 2018, Aardman Animations announced that Lord and Sproxton would be transferring majority ownership of the company to its employees in order to keep the studio independent. In January 2019, Lord and Sproxton released a book detailing the history of the studio, called &quot;A Grand Success! The Aardman Journey, One Frame at a Time&quot;.

===2020–present===
In December 2020, Netflix announced an Aardman Christmas musical special entitled &quot;Robin Robin&quot;. The 30-minute short, starring Bronte Carmichael, Richard E. Grant, Gillian Anderson and Adeel Akhtar, was released on the platform on 24 November 2021.

On 9 August 2021, it was announced that Gurinder Chadha was directing a musical claymation feature set in India, telling the story of an elephant dreaming about becoming a dancer.

On 30 November 2021, Aardman began producing &quot;The Very Small Creatures&quot; for Sky Kids and Apple TV.

On 20 January 2022, Netflix announced a sequel to &quot;Chicken Run&quot; entitled &quot;Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget&quot;. The film, starring Thandiwe Newton and Zachary Levi, premiered on the platform on 15 December 2023. A new &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; film was also confirmed to be &#x27;in the works&#x27; for a 2024 release on the BBC in the UK and Netflix for the rest the world. Also in 2022–2023, the 52 episode children&#x27;s series &quot;Lloyd of the Flies&quot; aired on CITV.

Aardman is one of the nine studios involved with Lucasfilm&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Visions Volume 2&quot;, contributing the film &quot;I Am Your Mother&quot;.

The factory that made Lewis Newplast, the modelling clay used by Aardman, shut down in March 2023; Aardman purchased enough remaining clay to cover the 2024 &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; film. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; initially reported that the studio may not be able to produce new films afterwards due to a lack of clay, but Aardman later released a statement clarifying that it would find a new supplier.

On 1 March 2024 the company announced a number of changes. Emma Hardie was to take up the newly created role of Executive Commercial and Brand Director, and would be responsible for overseeing the financing, distribution, licensing, marketing, and planning of the studio&#x27;s animated intellectual property. She took up the role, which includes a seat on Aardman&#x27;s executive board, on April 15.
Peter Lord was also stepping down from Aardman’s executive board to focus on a slate of individual projects as the Creative Director and would act as an ambassador for the company and British animation. Among the announcements, Sarah Cox and Daniel Efergan were promoted to Chief Creative Director and Executive Creative Director of Interactive &amp; Innovation, respectively.

On 8 March 2024 Aardman and the BBC announced a new collaboration called &quot;Things We Love&quot;, based on the studio&#x27;s &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; films, set to air throughout 2024. Like &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;, the six, 30-second-long shorts feature animated animals matched to the audio of real, unscripted interviews.

On 6 June 2024, Aardman announced the title of the new &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; feature film as &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl&quot;.

On 22 September 2024, Cartoon Network announced on Twitter that they had recruited Aardman to work on an &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot; special alongside series creator Patrick McHale to celebrate the miniseries&#x27; 10th anniversary, set for release on 3 November 2024. On 21 October 2024, Aardman announced that they would team up with Mattel Television Studios to produce a new &quot;Pingu&quot; series. Additionally, on 11 December that year, it was announced that Aardman would be collaborating with The Pokémon Company for a project in 2027.

==Company name==
The company name is taken from one of its early characters, a superhero created for &quot;Vision On&quot; in 1972. Unlike the claymation productions that the company are famous for, Aardman was cel-animated. Peter Lord has stated that the most interesting thing about the company name is that it &quot;means nothing&quot; and is only a joke that two teenagers found funny. He has stated that the name came from a combination of &quot;Aardvark&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; for the reason that they found &quot;aardvark&quot; to be a particularly funny word. Aardman Animations became their company name when the BBC asked them to whom they should make their first cheque out. Co-founder David Sproxton has claimed that the name was a result of being unable to &quot;find another word with more A&#x27;s in it than &#x27;aardvark as a schoolboy.

==Non-Aardman productions by Aardman directors==
A number of Aardman directors have worked at other studios, taking the distinctive Aardman style with them.

Aardman&#x27;s Steve Box directed the animated music video for the Spice Girls&#x27; final single as a five-piece, &quot;Viva Forever&quot;. The video took over five months to produce, considerably longer than the group&#x27;s box office hit movie, &quot;Spice World&quot;. He is also the co-creator of the Finnish-British animated series &quot;Moominvalley&quot;, based on the Moomins books.

Barry Purves, director of the Aardman short &quot;Next&quot;, also directed &quot;Hamilton Mattress&quot; for Harvest Films. The film, a half-hour special that premiered on Christmas Day 2001, was produced by Chris Moll, producer of the &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; short film &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot;. The models were provided by Mackinnon &amp; Saunders, a firm that did the same for &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; and &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;.

Similarly, &quot;Robbie the Reindeer in Hooves of Fire&quot;, a BBC Bristol/Comic Relief production, was directed by Richard Goleszowski, creator of &quot;Rex the Runt&quot;. Its sequel, &quot;Robbie the Reindeer in Legend of the Lost Tribe&quot;, was directed by Peter Peake, whose directorial credits for Aardman include &quot;Pib and Pog&quot; and &quot;Humdrum&quot;.

Aardman alumni also produced many of the claymation shorts used in the 1986–1990 American television series &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;.

<text>Wells () is a cathedral city and civil parish in Somerset, located on the southern edge of the Mendip Hills, south-east of Weston-super-Mare, south-west of Bath and south of Bristol. Although the population recorded in the 2011 census was only 10,536, (increased to 12,000 by 2018) and with a built-up area of just , Wells has had city status since medieval times, because of the presence of Wells Cathedral. Often described as England&#x27;s smallest city, it is actually the second smallest to the City of London in area and population, but unlike London it is not part of a larger urban agglomeration.

Wells takes its name from three wells dedicated to Saint Andrew, one in the market place and two within the grounds of the Bishop&#x27;s Palace and cathedral. A small Roman settlement surrounded them, which grew in importance and size under the Anglo-Saxons when King Ine of Wessex founded a minster church there in 704. The community became a trading centre based on cloth making and Wells is notable for its 17th-century involvement in both the English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion. In the 19th century, transport infrastructure improved with stations on three different railway lines. However, since 1964 the city has been without a railway link.

The cathedral and the associated religious and medieval architectural history provide
much of the employment. The city has a variety of sporting and cultural activities and houses several schools including The Blue School, a state coeducational comprehensive school that was founded in 1641, and the private Wells Cathedral School, which was founded possibly as early as 909 and is one of the five established musical schools for school-age children in the United Kingdom. Wells&#x27;s historic architecture has led to the city being used as a shooting location for numerous films and television programmes.

==History==
The city was a Roman settlement that became an important centre under the Anglo-Saxons when King Ine of Wessex founded a minster church in 704. Two hundred years later, in 909, it became the seat of the newly formed bishopric of Wells; but in 1090, the bishop&#x27;s seat was removed to Bath. The move caused severe arguments between the canons of Wells and the monks of Bath until 1245 when the bishopric was renamed the Diocese of Bath and Wells, to be elected by both religious houses. With the construction of the current cathedral and the bishop&#x27;s palace in the first half of the 13th century, under the direction of Bishop Reginald and later Bishop Jocelin, a native of the city, Wells became the principal seat of the diocese.

The 8th-century port at Bleadney on the River Axe enabled goods to be brought to within of Wells. In the Middle Ages overseas trade was carried out from the port of Rackley. In the 14th century a French ship sailed up the river, and by 1388 Thomas Tanner from Wells used Rackley to export cloth and corn to Portugal, and received iron and salt in exchange. Wells had been a centre for cloth making; however, in the 16th and 17th centuries this diminished, but the city retained its important market focus. Wells in the 19th century had the largest cheese market in the west of England.

Wells was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Welle&quot;, from the Old English , not as a town but as four manors with a population of 132, which implies a population of 500–600. Earlier names for the settlement have been identified which include &quot;Fontanetum&quot;, in a charter of 725 granted by King Ina to Glastonbury and . &quot;&quot;Tidesput&quot; or &quot;Tithesput furlang&quot;&quot; relates to the area east of the bishop&#x27;s garden in 1245. Wells was part of, and gave its name to, the hundred of Wells Forum.

Wells had been granted charters to hold markets by Bishop Robert (1136–66) and free burgage tenure was granted by Bishop Reginald (1174–1191). Wells was recognised as a free borough by a Royal charter of King John in 1201. The city remained under episcopal control until its charter of incorporation from Queen Elizabeth I in 1589. City status was most recently confirmed by Queen Elizabeth II by letters patent issued under the Great Seal dated 1 April 1974, which granted city status specifically to the civil parish; on that date major local government reorganisation came into effect, which involved the abolition of the municipal borough of Wells.

Anne of Denmark, the wife of King James came to Wells on 20 August 1613. She was entertained by a pageant performed by the town&#x27;s trades and crafts. The blacksmiths presented Vulcan&#x27;s forge. The butchers made a tableau of &quot;old virgins&quot;, with their attires made of cow tails and necklaces made of cow&#x27;s horns, who were drawn in a chariot by men and boys dressed in ox skins. The mayor, William Bull, held a dinner for members of the queen&#x27;s household including her four maids of honour. The Venetian ambassador Antonio Foscarini recorded her delight.

During the English Civil War (1642–1651), at what became known as the &quot;Siege of Wells&quot;, the city found itself surrounded by Parliamentarian guns on the Bristol, Glastonbury and Shepton Mallet sides. Col. William Strode had 2,000 men and 150 horse. The Royalists evacuated the city. Parliamentarian troops then used the cathedral to stable their horses and damaged much of the ornate sculpture by using it for firing practice.

William Penn stayed in Wells shortly before leaving for America (1682), spending a night at The Crown Inn. Here he was briefly arrested for addressing a large crowd in the market place, but released on the intervention of the Bishop of Bath and Wells. During the Monmouth Rebellion (1685) the rebel army attacked the cathedral in an outburst against the established church and damaged the west front. Lead from the roof was used to make bullets, windows were broken, the organ smashed and horses stabled in the nave. Wells was the final location of the Bloody Assizes on 23 September 1685. In a makeshift court lasting only one day, over 500 men were tried and the majority sentenced to death.
Wells first station, Priory Road, opened in 1859 on the Somerset Central Railway (later the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway, S&amp;DJR) as the terminus of a short branch from Glastonbury. A second railway, the East Somerset, opened a branch line from Witham in 1862 and built Wells East Somerset station to the east of Priory Road. In 1870, the Cheddar Valley line branch of the Bristol &amp; Exeter Railway from Yatton, reached Wells and built a third station at Tucker Street. Matters were simplified when the Great Western Railway acquired the Cheddar Valley and the East Somerset lines and built a link between them that ran through the S&amp;DJR&#x27;s Priory Road station. In 1878, when through trains began running between Yatton and Witham, the East Somerset station closed, but through trains did not stop at Priory Road until 1934. Priory Road closed to passenger traffic in 1951 when the S&amp;DJR branch line from Glastonbury was shut, though it remained the city&#x27;s main goods depot. Tucker Street closed in 1963 under the Beeching cuts, which closed the Yatton to Witham line to passengers. Goods traffic to Wells ceased in 1964. Southern Railway West Country class steam locomotive no 34092 was named &quot;City of Wells&quot; at a ceremony at Priory Road station in 1949. It was used to haul the &quot;Golden Arrow&quot; service between London and Dover. It was withdrawn from service in 1964, and rescued from a scrapyard in 1971, and as August 2021 was operational on the East Lancashire Railway.

During World War II, Stoberry Park in Wells was the location of a prisoner-of-war camp, housing Italian prisoners from the Western Desert Campaign, and later German prisoners after the Battle of Normandy. Penleigh Camp on the Wookey Hole Road was a German working camp.

==Governance==
Wells City Council is a parish council, with a membership of sixteen councillors, elected from three parish wards. They are (with the number of parish councillors each elects, in brackets): Central (four), St. Thomas&#x27; (six) and St. Cuthbert&#x27;s (six).

The civil parish of Wells was formed in 1933 upon the merger of Wells St Cuthbert In and Wells St Andrew (the latter being the historic liberty of the cathedral, the bishop&#x27;s palace, etc., amounting to just ). Wells is the successor parish for Wells Municipal Borough, which existed from the creation of municipal boroughs in 1835 to their abolition in 1974. The parish has held the city status of Wells since 1 April 1974 (previously held by the municipal borough) and the member of the City Council who chairs the council holds the historic office of Mayor of Wells, typically for one year. The current mayor (for the 2024-25 municipal year) is Councillor Jasmine Browne, who is the 650th Mayor of Wells. She assumed office on 18th May 2024. Another historic position is that of the Town Crier.

The City Council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. They also evaluate local planning applications and work with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. This includes city centre management including CCTV, an alcohol ban and regulating street trading permissions including the two funfairs held in the Market Place in May and November each year and the Wells in Bloom competition. The city council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of city facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. They are involved in the management of the Community Sports Development Centre at the Blue School, the skateboard park and allotments in the grounds of the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, Burcott Road and Barnes Close. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

Wells Town Hall was built in 1778, with the porch and arcade being added in 1861 and the balcony and round windows in 1932. It is a Grade II listed building. It replaced the former on the site of the Market and Assize Hall in the Market Place, and a Canonical House also known as &#x27;The Exchequer&#x27;, on the authority of an Act of Parliament dated 1779. The building also houses the magistrates courts and other offices. The Assize court last sat here in October 1970.

All other local government services are provided by Somerset Council, a unitary authority established in April 2023. Prior to this date, Wells elected five councillors to Mendip District Council from the same three wards as are used for the City Council (two were returned from St Cuthbert&#x27;s, two from St Thomas&#x27; and one from Central). Wells is an electoral division (with the same boundaries as the civil parish) of Somerset and returns two councillor to Somerset Council, but returned one to its predecessor Somerset County Council. Wells is part of the Wells and Mendip Hills constituency.

The Wells city arms show an ash tree surrounded by three water wells, crested with a gold mural crown, with the Latin motto &quot;Hoc fonte derivata copia&quot; (translated: &quot;the fullness that springs from this well&quot;).

The council formalised twinning links with Paray-le-Monial, France, and Bad Dürkheim, Germany in 1979, then added Fontanellato, Italy in 1983; the Wells Twinning Association and the Mayor of Wells organise the twinning activities.

, Mary Bignal-Rand, Danny Nightingale, The Rifles and the late Harry Patch have the Freedom of the City. The Somerset Light Infantry received the freedom of the City of Wells following their return from Cyprus in 1956.

==City status==
As the seat of an ancient cathedral and diocese, Wells is historically regarded as a city. City status was most recently confirmed by Queen Elizabeth II by letters patent dated 1 April 1974, which granted city status specifically to the civil parish. As the designation is typically awarded to a local council area, this administrative area is then considered to be the formal boundary of the city, including its urban and rural extents. Wells, due to its urban area and wider parish sizes, is near-smallest city on several measures based on 2011 statistics:

*Its city council boundary area, surrounded wholly by countryside makes Wells the smallest free-standing city in the UK (2.11 sq mi) - the City of London is smaller (1.12) but is part of a much larger urban area (Greater London - 671 sq mi)
*2nd smallest in England and UK by city council boundary area (2.11 sq mi) behind the City of London (1.12)
*2nd smallest in England only by population and urban area (10,536 residents, 1.35 sq mi) behind the City of London (8,072, 1.12)
*4th smallest in the UK by population and urban area behind St Davids (1,841 residents, 0.23 sq mi), St Asaph (3,355, 0.50) and the City of London (8,072, 1.12).

==Geography==
Wells lies at the foot of the southern escarpment of the Mendip Hills where they meet the Somerset Levels. The hills are largely made of carboniferous limestone, which is quarried at several nearby sites. In the 1960s, the tallest mast in the region, the Mendip UHF television transmitter, was installed on Pen Hill above Wells, approximately from the centre of the city.

Streams passing through caves on the Mendip Hills, including Thrupe Lane Swallet and Viaduct Sink (approximately east of the city), emerge at Saint Andrew&#x27;s Well in the garden of the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, from where the water fills the moat around the Palace and then flows into Keward Brook, which carries it for approximately a mile west to the point where the brook joins the River Sheppey in the village of Coxley.

Along with the rest of South West England, the Mendip Hills have a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between . July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around . In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.

Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.

The civil parish of Wells is entirely surrounded by the parish of St Cuthbert Out.

==Demography==
The population of the civil parish, recorded in the 2011 census, was 10,536. Of this number 97.5% are ethnically White (with the more specific White British category recorded at 93.5%) and 66.5% described themselves as Christian. The mean average age in 2011 was 41.9 years (the median age being 43). The population recorded for the Wells civil parish in the 2001 census was 10,406.

==Economy==

Following construction of the A39/A371 bypass, the centre of the city has returned to being that of a quiet market town. It has all the modern conveniences plus shops, hotels and restaurants. Wells is a popular tourist destination, due to its historical sites, its proximity to Bath, Bristol, Stonehenge and Glastonbury and its closeness to the Somerset coast. Also nearby are Wookey Hole Caves, the Mendip Hills and the Somerset Levels. Somerset cheese, including Cheddar, is made locally. Wells is part of the Wells and Shepton Mallet travel to work area which also includes Glastonbury, Cheddar and surrounding areas.

The historic part of the city has often been used for filming both documentaries and many period films and television series, including some with very large productions. Recent examples (2014 to 2017) include filming for Series 2 of &quot;Poldark&quot;, &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, &quot;Another Mother&#x27;s Son&quot;, &quot;Broadchurch&quot;, &quot;The Levelling&quot;, &quot;Mum&#x27;s List&quot;, and &quot;The White Princess&quot;. In addition to Wells Cathedral, the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, Wells is particularly popular among productions, with filming at the latter conducted (in 2015–2016) for &quot;The Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War&quot;, &quot;Galavant&quot;, Terry and Mason&#x27;s &quot;The Great British Food Trip&quot;, &quot;Escape to the Country&quot;, and &quot;Holiday of My Lifetime&quot;.

==Transport==
Wells is situated at the junction of three numbered routes. The A39 goes north-east to Bath and south-west to Glastonbury and Bridgwater. The A371 goes north-west to Cheddar and Weston-super-Mare, and east to Shepton Mallet. The B3139 goes west to Highbridge, and north-east to Radstock and Trowbridge. The nearest motorway connections are at junction 23 on the M5 via the A39 and at junction 1 of the M32 via the A39 and A37.

Wells is served by First West of England bus services to Bristol and Bristol Temple Meads station, Bath, Frome, Shepton Mallet, Yeovil, Street and Weston-super-Mare, as well as providing some local service. It is served by Berrys Coaches daily Superfast service to and from London. The bus station is in Princes Road. The Mendip Way and Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpaths pass through the city, as does National Cycle Route 3.

===Railways===
Wells had two stations which were closed by the Beeching Axe in the 1960s: Wells (Tucker Street) railway station and Wells (Priory Road) railway station. The nearest railway line today is the East Somerset Railway.

The nearest station today for the national rail network is Castle Cary, away. Bristol Temple Meads railway station is accessible via the 376 bus route; the journey time is around one hour.

==Religious sites==
A walled precinct, the Liberty of St Andrew, encloses the twelfth century Cathedral, the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, Vicar&#x27;s Close and the residences of the clergy who serve the cathedral. Entrances include the Penniless Porch, The Bishop&#x27;s Eye and Brown&#x27;s Gatehouse which were all built around 1450.

The Church of St Cuthbert has a Somerset stone tower and a carved roof. Originally an Early English building (13th century), it was much altered in the Perpendicular period. The nave&#x27;s coloured ceiling was repainted in 1963 at the instigation of the then Vicar&#x27;s wife, Mrs Barnett. Until 1561 the church had a central tower which either collapsed or was removed, and has been replaced with the current tower over the west door. Bells were cast for the tower by Roger Purdy.

The polychromatic stone Church of St Thomas was built during 1856 and 1857 and extended by Samuel Sanders Teulon in 1864, commemorating the work of Richard Jenkyns the Dean of Wells who had cared for the poor in the east of the city.

Wells Vineyard Church is an Evangelical Church formed in 2003.
===Wells Cathedral===
The cathedral is the seat of the Church of England Diocese of Bath and Wells. Wells has been an ecclesiastical city of importance since at least the early 8th century. Parts of the building date back to the tenth century, and it is a grade I listed building. It is known for its fine fan vaulted ceilings, Lady Chapel and windows, and the scissor arches which support the central tower. The west front is said to be the finest collection of statuary in Europe, retaining almost 300 of its original medieval statues, carved from the cathedral&#x27;s warm, yellow Doulting stone. The Chapter House, at the top of a flight of stone stairs, leading out from the north transept is an octagonal building with a fan-vaulted ceiling. It is here that the business of running the cathedral is still conducted by the members of the Chapter, the cathedral&#x27;s ruling body. Wells Cathedral clock is famous for its 24-hour astronomical dial and set of jousting knights that perform every quarter-hour. The cathedral has the heaviest ring of ten bells in the world. The tenor bell weighs just over 56 cwt (6,272 lb, 2,844 kg).

The Vicars&#x27; Close is the oldest residential street in Europe. The Close is tapered by to make it look longer when viewed from the bottom. When viewed from the top, however, it looks shorter. The Old Deanery dates from the 12th century, and St John&#x27;s Priory from the 14th. The street is owned by Wells Cathedral.

===The Bishop&#x27;s Palace===
The Bishop&#x27;s Palace has been the home of the bishops of the Diocese of Bath and Wells for 800 years. The hall and chapel date from the 14th century. There are of gardens including the springs from which the city takes its name. Visitors can also see the Bishop&#x27;s private chapel, ruined great hall and the gatehouse with portcullis and drawbridge beside which mute swans ring a bell for food. The Bishop&#x27;s Barn was built in the 15th century.

==In popular culture==
Elizabeth Goudge used Wells as a basis for the fictional cathedral city of Torminster, in her book &quot;A City of Bells&quot; (1936), and its two sequels &quot;Sister of the Angels&quot; (1939) and &quot;Henrietta&#x27;s House&quot; (1942: &quot;The Blue Hills&quot;, USA title).

Wells has been used as the setting for several films including: &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (1973), &quot;A Fistful of Fingers&quot; (1994), &quot;The Gathering &quot; (2003), &quot;The Libertine&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot; (2007), and &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007, as Sandford). The cathedral interior stood in for Southwark Cathedral during filming for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot;, and was also used as an interior location in the film &quot;Jack the Giant Slayer&quot; (2013), and in 2017 for the film Hellboy. In 2017 the market square and town hall was used for production of the BBC series Poldark.

<text>In mathematics, a dyadic rational or binary rational is a number that can be expressed as a fraction whose denominator is a power of two. For example, 1/2, 3/2, and 3/8 are dyadic rationals, but 1/3 is not. These numbers are important in computer science because they are the only ones with finite binary representations. Dyadic rationals also have applications in weights and measures, musical time signatures, and early mathematics education. They can accurately approximate any real number.

The sum, difference, or product of any two dyadic rational numbers is another dyadic rational number, given by a simple formula. However, division of one dyadic rational number by another does not always produce a dyadic rational result. Mathematically, this means that the dyadic rational numbers form a ring, lying between the ring of integers and the field of rational numbers. This ring may be denoted formula_1.

In advanced mathematics, the dyadic rational numbers are central to the constructions of the dyadic solenoid, Minkowski&#x27;s question-mark function, Daubechies wavelets, Thompson&#x27;s group, Prüfer 2-group, surreal numbers, and fusible numbers. These numbers are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers; they form a subsystem of the 2-adic numbers as well as of the reals, and can represent the fractional parts of 2-adic numbers. Functions from natural numbers to dyadic rationals have been used to formalize mathematical analysis in reverse mathematics.

==Applications==
===In measurement===

Many traditional systems of weights and measures are based on the idea of repeated halving, which produces dyadic rationals when measuring fractional amounts of units. The inch is customarily subdivided in dyadic rationals rather than using a decimal subdivision. The customary divisions of the gallon into half-gallons, quarts, pints, and cups are also dyadic. The ancient Egyptians used dyadic rationals in measurement, with denominators up to 64. Similarly, systems of weights from the Indus Valley civilisation are for the most part based on repeated halving; anthropologist Heather M.-L. Miller writes that &quot;halving is a relatively simple operation with beam balances, which is likely why so many weight systems of this time period used binary systems&quot;.

===In computing===
Dyadic rationals are central to computer science as a type of fractional number that many computers can manipulate directly. In particular, as a data type used by computers, floating-point numbers are often defined as integers multiplied by positive or negative powers of two. The numbers that can be represented precisely in a floating-point format, such as the IEEE floating-point datatypes, are called its representable numbers. For most floating-point representations, the representable numbers are a subset of the dyadic rationals. The same is true for fixed-point datatypes, which also use powers of two implicitly in the majority of cases. Because of the simplicity of computing with dyadic rationals, they are also used for exact real computing using interval arithmetic, and are central to some theoretical models of computable numbers.

Generating a random variable from random bits, in a fixed amount of time, is possible only when the variable has finitely many outcomes whose probabilities are all dyadic rational numbers. For random variables whose probabilities are not dyadic, it is necessary either to approximate their probabilities by dyadic rationals, or to use a random generation process whose time is itself random and unbounded.

===In music===

Time signatures in Western musical notation traditionally are written in a form resembling fractions (for example: , , or ), although the horizontal line of the musical staff that separates the top and bottom number is usually omitted when writing the signature separately from its staff. As fractions they are generally dyadic, although non-dyadic time signatures have also been used. The numeric value of the signature, interpreted as a fraction, describes the length of a measure as a fraction of a whole note. Its numerator describes the number of beats per measure, and the denominator describes the length of each beat.

===In mathematics education===
In theories of childhood development of the concept of a fraction based on the work of Jean Piaget, fractional numbers arising from halving and repeated halving are among the earliest forms of fractions to develop. This stage of development of the concept of fractions has been called &quot;algorithmic halving&quot;. Addition and subtraction of these numbers can be performed in steps that only involve doubling, halving, adding, and subtracting integers. In contrast, addition and subtraction of more general fractions involves integer multiplication and factorization to reach a common denominator. Therefore, dyadic fractions can be easier for students to calculate with than more general fractions.

==Definitions and arithmetic==
The dyadic numbers are the rational numbers that result from dividing an integer by a power of two. A rational number formula_2 in simplest terms is a dyadic rational when formula_3 is a power of two. Another equivalent way of defining the dyadic rationals is that they are the real numbers that have a terminating binary representation.

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of any two dyadic rationals produces another dyadic rational, according to the following formulas:
: formula_4
However, the result of dividing one dyadic rational by another is not necessarily a dyadic rational. For instance, 1 and 3 are both dyadic rational numbers, but 1/3 is not.

==Additional properties==
Every integer, and every half-integer, is a dyadic rational. They both meet the definition of being an integer divided by a power of two: every integer is an integer divided by one (the zeroth power of two), and every half-integer is an integer divided by two.

Every real number can be arbitrarily closely approximated by dyadic rationals. In particular, for a real number formula_5, consider the dyadic rationals of the form where formula_6 can be any integer and formula_7 denotes the floor function that rounds its argument down to an integer. These numbers approximate formula_5 from below to within an error of formula_9, which can be made arbitrarily small by choosing formula_6 to be arbitrarily large. For a fractal subset of the real numbers, this error bound is within a constant factor of optimal: for these numbers, there is no approximation formula_11 with error smaller than a constant times formula_9. The existence of accurate dyadic approximations can be expressed by saying that the set of all dyadic rationals is dense in the real line. More strongly, this set is uniformly dense, in the sense that the dyadic rationals with denominator formula_13 are uniformly spaced on the real line.

The dyadic rationals are precisely those numbers possessing finite binary expansions. Their binary expansions are not unique; there is one finite and one infinite representation of each dyadic rational other than 0 (ignoring terminal 0s). For example, 0.112 = 0.10111...2, giving two different representations for 3/4. The dyadic rationals are the only numbers whose binary expansions are not unique.

==In advanced mathematics==
===Algebraic structure===
Because they are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but not division, the dyadic rationals are a ring but not a field. The ring of dyadic rationals may be denoted formula_1, meaning that it can be generated by evaluating polynomials with integer coefficients, at the argument 1/2. As a ring, the dyadic rationals are a subring of the rational numbers, and an overring of the integers. Algebraically, this ring is the localization of the integers with respect to the set of powers of two.

As well as forming a subring of the real numbers, the dyadic rational numbers form a subring of the 2-adic numbers, a system of numbers that can be defined from binary representations that are finite to the right of the binary point but may extend infinitely far to the left. The 2-adic numbers include all rational numbers, not just the dyadic rationals. Embedding the dyadic rationals into the 2-adic numbers does not change the arithmetic of the dyadic rationals, but it gives them a different topological structure than they have as a subring of the real numbers. As they do in the reals, the dyadic rationals form a dense subset of the 2-adic numbers, and are the set of 2-adic numbers with finite binary expansions. Every 2-adic number can be decomposed into the sum of a 2-adic integer and a dyadic rational; in this sense, the dyadic rationals can represent the fractional parts of 2-adic numbers, but this decomposition is not unique.

Addition of dyadic rationals modulo 1 (the quotient group formula_15 of the dyadic rationals by the integers) forms the Prüfer 2-group.

===Dyadic solenoid===
Considering only the addition and subtraction operations of the dyadic rationals gives them the structure of an additive abelian group. Pontryagin duality is a method for understanding abelian groups by constructing dual groups, whose elements are characters of the original group, group homomorphisms to the multiplicative group of the complex numbers, with pointwise multiplication as the dual group operation. The dual group of the additive dyadic rationals, constructed in this way, can also be viewed as a topological group. It is called the dyadic solenoid, and is isomorphic to the topological product of the real numbers and 2-adic numbers, quotiented by the diagonal embedding of the dyadic rationals into this product. It is an example of a protorus, a solenoid, and an indecomposable continuum.

===Functions with dyadic rationals as distinguished points===

Because they are a dense subset of the real numbers, the dyadic rationals, with their numeric ordering, form a dense order. As with any two unbounded countable dense linear orders, by Cantor&#x27;s isomorphism theorem, the dyadic rationals are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers. In this case, Minkowski&#x27;s question-mark function provides an order-preserving bijection between the set of all rational numbers and the set of dyadic rationals.

The dyadic rationals play a key role in the analysis of Daubechies wavelets, as the set of points where the scaling function of these wavelets is non-smooth. Similarly, the dyadic rationals parameterize the discontinuities in the boundary between stable and unstable points in the parameter space of the Hénon map.

The set of piecewise linear homeomorphisms from the unit interval to itself that have power-of-2 slopes and dyadic-rational breakpoints forms a group under the operation of function composition. This is Thompson&#x27;s group, the first known example of an infinite but finitely presented simple group. The same group can also be represented by an action on rooted binary trees, or by an action on the dyadic rationals within the unit interval.

===Other related constructions===
In reverse mathematics, one way of constructing the real numbers is to represent them as functions from unary numbers to dyadic rationals, where the value of one of these functions for the argument formula_6 is a dyadic rational with denominator formula_13 that approximates the given real number. Defining real numbers in this way allows many of the basic results of mathematical analysis to be proven within a restricted theory of second-order arithmetic called &quot;feasible analysis&quot; (BTFA).

The surreal numbers are generated by an iterated construction principle which starts by generating all finite dyadic rationals, and then goes on to create new and strange kinds of infinite, infinitesimal and other numbers. This number system is foundational to combinatorial game theory, and dyadic rationals arise naturally in this theory as the set of values of certain combinatorial games.

The fusible numbers are a subset of the dyadic rationals, the closure of the set formula_18 under the operation formula_19, restricted to pairs formula_20 with formula_21. They are well-ordered, with order type equal to the epsilon number formula_22. For each integer formula_23 the smallest fusible number that is greater than formula_23 has the form formula_25. The existence of formula_26 for each formula_23 cannot be proven in Peano arithmetic, and formula_26 grows so rapidly as a function of formula_23 that for formula_30 it is (in Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation for large numbers) already larger than formula_31.

The usual proof of Urysohn&#x27;s lemma utilizes the dyadic fractions for constructing the separating function from the lemma.

T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts to specific foreign invaders. The thymus is located in the upper front part of the chest, in the anterior superior mediastinum, behind the sternum, and in front of the heart. It is made up of two lobes, each consisting of a central medulla and an outer cortex, surrounded by a capsule.

The thymus is made up of immature T cells called thymocytes, as well as lining cells called epithelial cells which help the thymocytes develop. T cells that successfully develop react appropriately with MHC immune receptors of the body (called &quot;positive selection&quot;) and not against proteins of the body (called &quot;negative selection&quot;). The thymus is the largest and most active during the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods. By the early teens, the thymus begins to decrease in size and activity and the tissue of the thymus is gradually replaced by fatty tissue. Nevertheless, some T cell development continues throughout adult life.

Abnormalities of the thymus can result in a decreased number of T cells and autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 and myasthenia gravis. These are often associated with cancer of the tissue of the thymus, called thymoma, or tissues arising from immature lymphocytes such as T cells, called lymphoma. Removal of the thymus is called thymectomy. Although the thymus has been identified as a part of the body since the time of the Ancient Greeks, it is only since the 1960s that the function of the thymus in the immune system has become clearer.

== Structure ==
The thymus is an organ that sits behind the sternum in the upper front part of the chest, stretching upwards towards the neck. In children, the thymus is pinkish-gray, soft, and lobulated on its surfaces. At birth, it is about 4–6 cm long, 2.5–5 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. It increases in size until puberty, where it may have a size of about 40–50 g, following which it decreases in size in a process known as involution.

The thymus is located in the anterior mediastinum. It is made up of two lobes that meet in the upper midline, and stretch from below the thyroid in the neck to as low as the cartilage of the fourth rib. The lobes are covered by a capsule. The thymus lies behind the sternum, rests on the pericardium, and is separated from the aortic arch and great vessels by a layer of fascia. The left brachiocephalic vein may even be embedded within the thymus. In the neck, it lies on the front and sides of the trachea, behind the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles.

===Microanatomy===
The thymus consists of two lobes, merged in the middle, surrounded by a capsule that extends with blood vessels into the interior. The lobes consist of an outer rich with cells and an inner less dense . The lobes are divided into smaller lobules 0.5-2 mm diameter, between which extrude radiating insertions from the capsule along .

The cortex is mainly made up of thymocytes and epithelial cells. The thymocytes, immature T cells, are supported by a network of the finely-branched epithelial reticular cells, which is continuous with a similar network in the medulla. This network forms an adventitia to the blood vessels, which enter the cortex via septa near the junction with the medulla. Other cells are also present in the thymus, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and a small amount of B cells, neutrophils and eosinophils.

In the medulla, the network of epithelial cells is coarser than in the cortex, and the lymphoid cells are relatively fewer in number. Concentric, nest-like bodies called Hassall&#x27;s corpuscles (also called &quot;thymic corpuscles&quot;) are formed by aggregations of the medullary epithelial cells. These are concentric, layered whorls of epithelial cells that increase in number throughout life. They are the remains of the epithelial tubes, which grow out from the third pharyngeal pouches of the embryo to form the thymus.

===Blood and nerve supply===
The arteries supplying the thymus are branches of the internal thoracic, and inferior thyroid arteries, with branches from the superior thyroid artery sometimes seen. The branches reach the thymus and travel with the septa of the capsule into the area between the cortex and medulla, where they enter the thymus itself; or alternatively directly enter the capsule.

The veins of the thymus, the thymic veins, end in the left brachiocephalic vein, internal thoracic vein, and in the inferior thyroid veins. Sometimes the veins end directly in the superior vena cava.

Lymphatic vessels travel only away from the thymus, accompanying the arteries and veins. These drain into the brachiocephalic, tracheobronchial and parasternal lymph nodes.

The nerves supplying the thymus arise from the vagus nerve and the cervical sympathetic chain. Branches from the phrenic nerves reach the capsule of the thymus, but do not enter into the thymus itself.

===Variation===
The two lobes differ slightly in size, with the left lobe usually higher than the right. Thymic tissue may be found scattered on or around the gland, and occasionally within the thyroid. The thymus in children stretches variably upwards, at times to as high as the thyroid gland.

==Development==

The thymocytes and the epithelium of the thymus have different developmental origins. The epithelium of the thymus develops first, appearing as two outgrowths, one on either side, of the third pharyngeal pouch. It sometimes also involves the fourth pharyngeal pouch. These extend outward and backward into the surrounding mesoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme in front of the ventral aorta. Here the thymocytes and epithelium meet and join with connective tissue. The pharyngeal opening of each diverticulum is soon obliterated, but the neck of the flask persists for some time as a cellular cord. By further proliferation of the cells lining the flask, buds of cells are formed, which become surrounded and isolated by the invading mesoderm.

The epithelium forms fine lobules, and develops into a sponge-like structure. During this stage, hematopoietic bone-marrow precursors migrate into the thymus. Normal development is dependent on the interaction between the epithelium and the hematopoietic thymocytes. Iodine is also necessary for thymus development and activity.

===Involution===
The thymus continues to grow after birth reaching the relative maximum size by puberty. It is most active in fetal and neonatal life. It increases to a mass of 20 to 50 grams by puberty. It then begins to decrease in size and activity in a process called thymic involution. After the first year of life the amount of T cells produced begins to fall. Fat and connective tissue fills a part of the thymic volume. During involution, the thymus decreases in size and activity. Fat cells are present at birth, but increase in size and number markedly after puberty, invading the gland from the walls between the lobules first, then into the cortex and medulla. This process continues into old age, where whether with a microscope or with the human eye, the thymus may be difficult to detect, although typically weighs 5–15 grams. Additionally, there is an increasing body of evidence showing that age-related thymic involution is found in most, if not all, vertebrate species with a thymus, suggesting that this is an evolutionary process that has been conserved.

The atrophy is due to the increased circulating level of sex hormones, and chemical or physical castration of an adult results in the thymus increasing in size and activity. Severe illness or human immunodeficiency virus infection may also result in involution.

== Function ==
===T cell maturation===
The thymus facilitates the maturation of T cells, an important part of the immune system providing cell-mediated immunity. T cells begin as hematopoietic precursors from the bone-marrow, and migrate to the thymus, where they are referred to as thymocytes. In the thymus, they undergo a process of maturation, which involves ensuring the cells react against antigens (&quot;positive selection&quot;), but that they do not react against antigens found on body tissue (&quot;negative selection&quot;). Once mature, T cells emigrate from the thymus to provide vital functions in the immune system.

Each T cell has a distinct T cell receptor, suited to a specific substance, called an antigen. Most T cell receptors bind to the major histocompatibility complex on cells of the body. The MHC presents an antigen to the T cell receptor, which becomes active if this matches the specific T cell receptor. In order to be properly functional, a mature T cell needs to be able to bind to the MHC molecule (&quot;positive selection&quot;), and not to react against antigens that are actually from the tissues of body (&quot;negative selection&quot;). Positive selection occurs in the cortex and negative selection occurs in the medulla of the thymus. After this process T cells that have survived leave the thymus, regulated by sphingosine-1-phosphate. Further maturation occurs in the peripheral circulation. Some of this is because of hormones and cytokines secreted by cells within the thymus, including thymulin, thymopoietin, and thymosins.

===Positive selection===
T cells have distinct T cell receptors. These distinct receptors are formed by process of V(D)J recombination gene rearrangement stimulated by RAG1 and RAG2 genes. This process is error-prone, and some thymocytes fail to make functional T-cell receptors, whereas other thymocytes make T-cell receptors that are autoreactive. If a functional T cell receptor is formed, the thymocyte will begin to express simultaneously the cell surface proteins CD4 and CD8.

The survival and nature of the T cell then depends on its interaction with surrounding thymic epithelial cells. Here, the T cell receptor interacts with the MHC molecules on the surface of epithelial cells. A T cell with a receptor that doesn&#x27;t react, or reacts weakly will die by apoptosis. A T cell that does react will survive and proliferate. A mature T cell expresses only CD4 or CD8, but not both. This depends on the strength of binding between the TCR and MHC class 1 or class 2. A T cell receptor that binds mostly to MHC class I tends to produce a mature &quot;cytotoxic&quot; CD8 positive T cell; a T cell receptor that binds mostly to MHC class II tends to produce a CD4 positive T cell.

===Negative selection===
T cells that attack the body&#x27;s own proteins are eliminated in the thymus, called &quot;negative selection&quot;. Epithelial cells in the medulla and dendritic cells in the thymus express major proteins from elsewhere in the body. The gene that stimulates this is AIRE. Thymocytes that react strongly to self antigens do not survive, and die by apoptosis. Some CD4 positive T cells exposed to self antigens persist as T regulatory cells.

==Clinical significance==
===Immunodeficiency===
As the thymus is where T cells develop, congenital problems with the development of the thymus can lead to immunodeficiency, whether because of a problem with the development of the thymus gland, or a problem specific to thymocyte development. Immunodeficiency can be profound. Loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation (as in DiGeorge syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, or a very rare &quot;nude&quot; thymus causing absence of hair and the thymus) results in severe immunodeficiency and subsequent high susceptibility to infection by viruses, protozoa, and fungi. Nude mice with the very rare &quot;nude&quot; deficiency as a result of FOXN1 mutation are a strain of research mice as a model of T cell deficiency.

The most common congenital cause of thymus-related immune deficiency results from the deletion of the 22nd chromosome, called DiGeorge syndrome. This results in a failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, resulting in failure of development of the thymus, and variable other associated problems, such as congenital heart disease, and abnormalities of mouth (such as cleft palate and cleft lip), failure of development of the parathyroid glands, and the presence of a fistula between the trachea and the oesophagus. Very low numbers of circulating T cells are seen. The condition is diagnosed by fluorescent in situ hybridization and treated with thymus transplantation.

Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) are group of rare congenital genetic diseases that can result in combined T, B, and NK cell deficiencies. These syndromes are caused by mutations that affect the maturation of the hematopoietic progenitor cells, which are the precursors of both B and T cells. A number of genetic defects can cause SCID, including IL-2 receptor gene loss of function, and mutation resulting in deficiency of the enzyme adenine deaminase.

===Autoimmune disease===
====Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome====
Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1, is a rare genetic autoimmune syndrome that results from a genetic defect of the thymus tissues. Specifically, the disease results from defects in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, which stimulates expression of self antigens in the epithelial cells within the medulla of the thymus. Because of defects in this condition, self antigens are not expressed, resulting in T cells that are not conditioned to tolerate tissues of the body, and may treat them as foreign, stimulating an immune response and resulting in autoimmunity. People with APECED develop an autoimmune disease that affects multiple endocrine tissues, with the commonly affected organs being hypothyroidism of the thyroid gland, Addison&#x27;s disease of the adrenal glands, and candida infection of body surfaces including the inner lining of the mouth and of the nails due to dysfunction of TH17 cells, and symptoms often beginning in childhood. Many other autoimmune diseases may also occur. Treatment is directed at the affected organs.

====Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity====
Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity can occur in people with thymoma. In this condition, the T cells developed in the thymus are directed against the tissues of the body. This is because the malignant thymus is incapable of appropriately educating developing thymocytes to eliminate self-reactive T cells. The condition is virtually indistinguishable from graft versus host disease.

====Myasthenia gravis====
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease most often due to antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors, involved in signalling between nerves and muscles. It is often associated with thymic hyperplasia or thymoma, with antibodies produced probably because of T cells that develop abnormally. Myasthenia gravis most often develops between young and middle age, causing easy fatiguing of muscle movements. Investigations include demonstrating antibodies (such as against acetylcholine receptors or muscle-specific kinase), and CT scan to detect thymoma or thymectomy. With regard to the thymus, removal of the thymus, called thymectomy may be considered as a treatment, particularly if a thymoma is found. Other treatments include increasing the duration of acetylcholine action at nerve synapses by decreasing the rate of breakdown. This is done by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine.

===Cancer===
====Thymomas====
Tumours originating from the thymic epithelial cells are called thymomas. They most often occur in adults older than 40. Tumours are generally detected when they cause symptoms, such as a neck mass or affecting nearby structures such as the superior vena cava; detected because of screening in patients with myasthenia gravis, which has a strong association with thymomas and hyperplasia; and detected as an incidental finding on imaging such as chest X-rays. Hyperplasia and tumours originating from the thymus are associated with other autoimmune diseases – such as hypogammaglobulinemia, Graves disease, pure red cell aplasia, pernicious anaemia and dermatomyositis, likely because of defects in negative selection in proliferating T cells.

Thymomas can be benign; benign but by virtue of expansion, invading beyond the capsule of the thymus (&quot;invasive thymoma&quot;), or malignant (a carcinoma). This classification is based on the appearance of the cells. A WHO classification also exists but is not used as part of standard clinical practice. Benign tumours confined to the thymus are most common; followed by locally invasive tumours, and then by carcinomas. There is variation in reporting, with some sources reporting malignant tumours as more common. Invasive tumours, although not technically malignant, can still spread () to other areas of the body. Even though thymomas occur of epithelial cells, they can also contain thymocytes. Treatment of thymomas often requires surgery to remove the entire thymus. This may also result in temporary remission of any associated autoimmune conditions.

====Lymphomas====

Tumours originating from T cells of the thymus form a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). These are similar in symptoms, investigation approach and management to other forms of ALL. Symptoms that develop, like other forms of ALL, relate to deficiency of platelets, resulting in bruising or bleeding; immunosuppression resulting in infections; or infiltration by cells into parts of the body, resulting in an enlarged liver, spleen, lymph nodes or other sites. Blood test might reveal a large amount of white blood cells or lymphoblasts, and deficiency in other cell lines – such as low platelets or anaemia. Immunophenotyping will reveal cells that are CD3, a protein found on T cells, and help further distinguish the maturity of the T cells. Genetic analysis including karyotyping may reveal specific abnormalities that may influence prognosis or treatment, such as the Philadelphia translocation. Management can include multiple courses of chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and management of associated problems, such as treatment of infections with antibiotics, and blood transfusions. Very high white cell counts may also require cytoreduction with apheresis.

Tumours originating from the small population of B cells present in the thymus lead to primary mediastinal large B cell lymphomas. These are a rare subtype of Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, although by the activity of genes and occasionally microscopic shape, unusually they also have the characteristics of Hodgkins lymphomas. that occur most commonly in young and middle-aged, more prominent in females. Most often, when symptoms occur it is because of compression of structures near the thymus, such as the superior vena cava or the upper respiratory tract; when lymph nodes are affected it is often in the mediastinum and neck groups. Such tumours are often detected with a biopsy that is subject to immunohistochemistry. This will show the presence of clusters of differentiation, cell surface proteins – namely CD30, with CD19, CD20 and CD22, and with the absence of CD15. Other markers may also be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment usually includes the typical regimens of CHOP or EPOCH or other regimens; regimens generally including cyclophosphamide, an anthracycline, prednisone, and other chemotherapeutics; and potentially also a stem cell transplant.

===Thymic cysts===

The thymus may contain cysts, usually less than 4 cm in diameter. Thymic cysts are usually detected incidentally and do not generally cause symptoms. Thymic cysts can occur along the neck or in the chest (mediastinum). Cysts usually just contain fluid and are lined by either many layers of flat cells or column-shaped cells. Despite this, the presence of a cyst can cause problems similar to those of thymomas, by compressing nearby structures, and some may contact internal walls () and be difficult to distinguish from tumours. When cysts are found, investigation may include a workup for tumours, which may include CT or MRI scan of the area the cyst is suspected to be in.

===Surgical removal===
Thymectomy is the surgical removal of the thymus. The usual reason for removal is to gain access to the heart for surgery to correct congenital heart defects in the neonatal period. Other indications for thymectomy include the removal of thymomas and the treatment of myasthenia gravis. In neonates the relative size of the thymus obstructs surgical access to the heart and its surrounding vessels. 

Removal of the thymus in infancy results in often fatal immunodeficiency, because functional T cells have not developed. In older children and adults, which have a functioning lymphatic system with mature T cells also situated in other lymphoid organs, the effect is reduced, but includes failure to mount immune responses against new antigens, an increase in cancers, and an increase in all-cause mortality.

==Society and culture==
When used as food for humans, the thymus of animals is known as one of the kinds of sweetbread.

==History==
The thymus was known to the ancient Greeks, and its name comes from the Greek word θυμός (&quot;thumos&quot;), meaning &quot;anger&quot;, or in Ancient Greek, &quot;heart, soul, desire, life&quot;, possibly because of its location in the chest, near where emotions are subjectively felt; or else the name comes from the herb &quot;thyme&quot; (also in Greek &quot;θύμος&quot; or &quot;θυμάρι&quot;), which became the name for a &quot;warty excrescence&quot;, possibly due to its resemblance to a bunch of thyme.

Galen was the first to note that the size of the organ changed over the duration of a person&#x27;s life.

In the 19th century, a condition was identified as &quot;status thymicolymphaticus&quot; defined by an increase in lymphoid tissue and an enlarged thymus. It was thought to be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome but is now an obsolete term.

The importance of the thymus in the immune system was discovered in 1961 by Jacques Miller, by surgically removing the thymus from one-day-old mice, and observing the subsequent deficiency in a lymphocyte population, subsequently named T cells after the organ of their origin. Until the discovery of its immunological role, the thymus had been dismissed as a &quot;evolutionary accident&quot;, without functional importance. The role the thymus played in ensuring mature T cells tolerated the tissues of the body was uncovered in 1962, with the finding that T cells of a transplanted thymus in mice demonstrated tolerance towards tissues of the donor mouse. B cells and T cells were identified as different types of lymphocytes in 1968, and the fact that T cells required maturation in the thymus was understood. The subtypes of T cells (CD8 and CD4) were identified by 1975. The way that these subclasses of T cells matured – positive selection of cells that functionally bound to MHC receptors – was known by the 1990s. The important role of the AIRE gene, and the role of negative selection in preventing autoreactive T cells from maturing, was understood by 1994.

Recently, advances in immunology have allowed the function of the thymus in T-cell maturation to be more fully understood.

==Other animals==
The thymus is present in all jawed vertebrates, where it undergoes the same shrinkage with age and plays the same immunological function as in other vertebrates. Recently, in 2011, a discrete thymus-like lympho-epithelial structure, termed the &quot;thymoid&quot;, was discovered in the gills of larval lampreys. Hagfish possess a protothymus associated with the pharyngeal velar muscles, which is responsible for a variety of immune responses.

The thymus is also present in most other vertebrates with similar structure and function as the human thymus. A second thymus in the neck has been reported sometimes to occur in the mouse. As in humans, the guinea pig&#x27;s thymus naturally atrophies as the animal reaches adulthood, but the athymic hairless guinea pig (which arose from a spontaneous laboratory mutation) possesses no thymic tissue whatsoever, and the organ cavity is replaced with cystic spaces.

<text>Dutch New Guinea or Netherlands New Guinea (, ) was the western half of the island of New Guinea that was a part of the Dutch East Indies until 1949, later an overseas territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 1949 to 1962. It contained what are now Indonesia&#x27;s six easternmost provinces, Central Papua, Highland Papua, Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua, and West Papua, which were administered as a single province prior to 2003 under the name &quot;Irian Jaya&quot;, and now comprise the Papua region of the country.

During the Indonesian Revolution, the Dutch launched to capture territory from the Indonesian Republic. However, the harsh methods of the Dutch had drawn international disapproval. With international opinion shifting towards support of the Indonesian Republic, the Dutch managed in 1949 to negotiate for the separation of Dutch New Guinea from the broader Indonesian settlement, with the fate of the disputed territory to be decided by the close of 1950. However, the Dutch in coming years were able to argue successfully at the UN that the indigenous population of Dutch New Guinea represented a separate ethnic group from the people of Indonesia and thus should not be absorbed into the Indonesian state.

In contrast, the Indonesian Republic, as successor state to the Netherlands East Indies, claimed Dutch New Guinea as part of its natural territorial bounds. The dispute over New Guinea was an important factor in the quick decline in bilateral relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia after Indonesian independence. The dispute escalated into low-level conflict in 1962 following Dutch moves in 1961 to establish a New Guinea Council.

Following the Vlakke Hoek incident, Indonesia launched a campaign of infiltrations designed to place pressure on the Dutch. Facing diplomatic pressure from the United States, fading domestic support and continual Indonesian threats to invade the territory, the Netherlands decided to relinquish control of the disputed territory in August 1962, agreeing to the Bunker Proposal on condition that a referendum to determine the final fate of the territory be conducted at a later date. The territory was administered by the UN temporarily before being transferred to Indonesia on 1 May 1963. A plebiscite, the Act of Free Choice, was eventually held in 1969, but the fairness of the election is disputed.

==Pre-World War II==
Before 1898, Papuans lived in isolated, competitive, and autonomous clan and tribal environments. In 1898, the Dutch came and established their presence. Their claim, which was made in 1848, was based on the Sultanate of Ternate&#x27;s claim on Papua based on Ternatean tributary relation. The Dutch first divided Papua into two afdeelings: Afdeeling Noord-Nieuw-Guinea (Manokwari), and Afdeeling West-En-Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea (Fakfak), both led by controleurs under the Residentie Ternate. The afdeelings were led by controleurs normally responsible for onderafdeeling instead of the usual asistent-resident due to newly established nature of the land. The colonial government set Tanjung Goede Hoop or Jamoer Seba (Yamursba) as the boundary of the two afdeeling

In 1901 to subdue the headhunting Ugeris and increase colonial control, Afdeeling West-En-Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea was split into Afdeeling West-Nieuw-Guinea and Afdeeling Zuid-New-Guinea. Afdeeling West-Nieuw-Guinea consisted of the part of Dutch New Guinea from Cape Jamoer Seba to Cape Steenboom and surrounding islands, including the group of Radja Ampat, under a Controller at Fakfak. While Afdeeling Zuid-New-Guinea consisted of the part of Dutch New Guinea from Cape Steenboom to the mouth of the Bensbach river and surrounding islands, under an assistent-resident with a to be determined capital. Later it would be Merauke which was founded on 12 February 1902 for the express purpose of being the capital.

Since their creation, Afdeeling West-Nieuw-Guinea would remain part of the Residentie Ternate until it was transferred into Residentie Amboina in 1911. While the Afdeeling Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea would be an independent afdeeling until it was put under Residentie Amboina in 1913.

In 1920, the three Afdeelings were made into its own residentie Nieuw Guinea. However it did not last as in August 1923 the Governor-General decided to merge the residency into Residentie Amboina. It followed the fate of Residentie Ternate which was also merged into Residentie Amboina in 1922. The merging process was done on 1 April 1924. The Afdeelings themselves were kept the same at the time.

In 1925, the status of the Residentie Amboina was upgraded to the Gouvernement der Molukken, which was divided into two residencies, namely Residentie Amboina and Residentie Ternate. Six onderafdeelings of New Guinea (Manokwari, Sorong, Schouteneilanden, Jappengroep, Hollandia dan West-Nieuw Guinea) were under the Residentie Ternate. While only one, the Onderafdeeling of Zuid-Nieuw Guinea was under the Residentie Amboina. The reduction in the status of the three afdeelings in Papua to onderafdeeling, and before that the Residentie Nieuw Guinea into Amboina, was caused by the decline in the regional income since the ban of hunting Cendrawasih in 1922.

In 1934, the status of the Gouvernement der Molukken was downgraded into Residentie der Molukken. The residency oversaw Afdeeling Ternate, Ambon, Tual, and North and West New Guinea. The Onderafdeeling Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea and Onderafdeeling Boven Digul were placed under Afdeeling Tual. Afdeeling Noord-Nieuw-Guinea and Afdeeling West-Nieuw-Guinea were combined into one afdeeling called Afdeeling Noord-En-West-New Guinea which oversaw 5 onderafdeeling namely Manokwari, Sorong, Serui, Hollandia and Fak-Fak.

In 1936 the Dutch colonial government shuffled a new territorial division in the residency. The residency was divided into two afdeelings, namely the Afdeeling Noord-Nieuw-Guinea which oversaw 5 onderafdeelings (Manokwari, Sorong, Central Vogelkop, Serui and Hollandia); and the West-En-Zuid-Nieuw Guinea Afdeeling also oversaw 5 onderafdeeling (Fak-Fak, Inanwatan, Mimika, Boven Digul and South Nieuw Guinea)

In 1937 Onderafdeeling Boven Digul and Onderafdeeling Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea were placed back under Afdeeling Tual. The Afdeeling West-Niuew-Guinea was separated from the afdeeling of Zuid-Niuew-Guinea. Both Afdeling Noord-Niuew-Guinea and Afdeling West-Niuew-Guinea oversaw 4 onderafdeeling each. Afdeling North New Guinea oversaw Fak-Fak, Central Vogelkop, Inanwatan and Mimika, while Afdeeling West New Guinea oversaw Manokwari, Sorong, Serui and Hollandia. The return of West Guinea&#x27;s Afdeeling status was related to the increase in private oil exploration activities carried out by the Nederlandsche Nieuw Guinea Petroleum Maatschappij (NNGPM) in Babo which began its activities in New Guinea on 23 April 1935.

In 1938, Gouvernement Groote Oost was created to encompass all Dutch East Indies residencies east of Java and Kalimantan.

In 1940 there was another shuffle, and Afdeeling Noord-Niuew-Guinea oversaw five onderafdeeling, namely Manokwari, Sorong, Serui, Sarmi and Hollandia. West New Guinea included three onderafdeelings, namely Fak-Fak, Inanwatan and Mimika. While Onderafdeeling Boven Digul and Onderafdeeling Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea were placed under Afdeeling of Tual.

Until after World War II, the western part of the island of New Guinea was part of the Great East (&quot;Groote Oost&quot;) governorate of the Dutch East Indies. The Netherlands claimed sovereignty over New Guinea within the colony through its protection over the Sultanate of Tidore, a sultanate on an island west of Halmahera in the Maluku Islands. In a 1660 treaty, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) recognised the Sultanate of Tidore&#x27;s supremacy over the Papuan people, the inhabitants of New Guinea. Probably this referred to some Papuan islands (Raja Ampat) near the Maluku Islands as well as coastal areas like Fakfak, through familial relations with local rulers, although Tidore never exercised actual control over the interior and highlands of New Guinea. In 1872, Tidore recognised Dutch sovereignty and granted permission to the Kingdom of the Netherlands to establish administration in its territories whenever the Netherlands Indies authorities would want to do so. This allowed the Netherlands to legitimise a claim to the New Guinea area.

The Dutch established the 141st meridian as the eastern frontier of the territory. In 1898, the Netherlands Indies government decided to establish administrative posts in Fakfak and Manokwari, followed by Merauke in 1902. The main reason for this was the expansion of British and German interests in the east. The Dutch wanted to make sure the United Kingdom and Germany would not move the border to the west. This resulted in the partition of the island of New Guinea.

In reality, most of New Guinea remained outside colonial influence. Little was known about the interior; large areas on the map were white and the number of inhabitants of the island was unknown, and numerous explorations were made into the interior from the turn of the 20th century on. The indigenous inhabitants of New Guinea were Papuans, living in tribes. They were hunter-gatherers.

Pre-World War II economic activity was limited. Only coastal and island dwellers traded to some extent, mostly with the Maluku Islands. A development company was founded in 1938 to change this situation, but it was not very active. So, until World War II, New Guinea was a disregarded and unimportant territory within the Netherlands Indies.

===Homeland for the Eurasians===
The group that was most interested in New Guinea before the war were the Eurasians or Indo people. Before the war, some 150,000 to 200,000 Eurasians were living in the Netherlands Indies. They were of mixed European and Indonesian descent and identified with the Netherlands and the Dutch way of life. In the colonial society of the Netherlands Indies, they held a higher social status than indigenous Indonesians (&quot;inlanders&quot;). They were mostly employed as office workers. As the educational level of indigenous Indonesians was on the rise, more and more Indonesians got jobs previously held by Eurasians. These had no other means of making a living, because, as Europeans, they were forbidden to buy land on Java. This situation caused mental and economic problems to the Eurasians. In 1923, the first plan to designate New Guinea as a settlement territory for Eurasians was devised. In 1926, a separate &quot;Vereniging tot Kolonisatie van Nieuw-Guinea&quot; (Association for the Settlement of New Guinea) was founded. In 1930, it was followed by the &quot;Stichting Immigratie Kolonisatie Nieuw-Guinea&quot; (Foundation Immigration and Settlement New Guinea). These organisations regarded New Guinea as an untouched, almost empty land that could serve as a homeland to the sidelined Eurasians, a kind of tropical Holland, where Eurasians could create an existence.

These associations succeeded in sending settlers to New Guinea and lobbied successfully for the establishment of a government agency to subsidise these initiatives (in 1938). However, most settlements ended in failure because of the harsh climate and natural conditions, and because of the fact the settlers, previously office workers, were not skilled in agriculture. The number of settlers remained small. In the Netherlands proper, some organisations existed that promoted a kind of &quot;tropical Holland&quot; in New Guinea, but they were rather marginal. They were linked to the NSB party and other fascist organisations.

==Administrative divisions==

==Origin of the dispute over New Guinea==

In 1942, most parts of the Netherlands Indies were occupied by Japan. Behind Japanese lines in New Guinea, Dutch guerrilla fighters resisted under Mauritz Christiaan Kokkelink. During the occupation the Indonesian nationalist movement went through a rapid development. After Japan&#x27;s surrender, Sukarno issued the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, which was to encompass the whole of the Netherlands Indies. The Dutch authorities returned after several months under the leadership of Lieutenant-Governor-General Hubertus van Mook. Van Mook decided to reform Indonesia on a federal basis. This was not a completely new idea, but it was contrary to the administrative practice in the Netherlands Indies until then and contrary to the ideas of the nationalists, who wanted a centralist Indonesia.

===Linggadjati agreement===
The ethnic diversity of Indonesia was initially discussed at two conferences in Malino and Pangkalpinang. During the Pangkalpinang conference, the right of self-determination of the Eurasian, Chinese, and Arab ethnic minorities was discussed. The new &quot;Grooter Nederland-Actie&quot; (Extended Netherlands Action) send delegates to this conference, who opined that New Guinea should be declared as separate entities in a similar manner to Surinam. Furthermore, this conference stipulated specific territories could have special relations with the Kingdom of the Netherlands if they wanted to.

Van Mook&#x27;s plan was to divide Indonesia into several federal states, &quot;negaras&quot;, with possible autonomous areas, &quot;daerahs&quot;. The whole would be called the United States of Indonesia and would remain linked to the Netherlands in the Netherlands-Indonesian Union. The Indonesian side agreed to this plan during the Linggadjati conference in November 1946. Van Mook thought a federal structure would safeguard Indonesia&#x27;s cultural and ethnic diversity. Van Mook and his supporters referred to the right of self-determination in this respect: the different ethnic communities of Indonesia should have the right to govern themselves.

===The unilateral amendment of &#x27;Linggadjati&#x27;===
To many Dutchmen, the idea of parting with Indonesia was shocking. Many Dutch thought their country had a mission to develop Indonesia. The Indonesian wish for independence to many Dutch came as a complete surprise. Because Indonesian nationalists, which had no electoral or official legitimacy—save ethno-state nationalism, under Sukarno cooperated with the Japanese, they were branded as traitors and collaborators. Almost every Dutch political party was against Indonesian independence. The Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) were very supportive of the Dutch Ethical Policy in Indonesia. The newly established liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy campaigned for a hard-line policy against the nationalists. Even the Labour Party, which supported Indonesian independence in principle, was hesitant, because of the policies of Sukarno.

Minister of Colonies Jan Anne Jonkman defended the Linggadjati Agreement in Parliament in 1946 by stating that the government wished for New Guinea to remain under Dutch sovereignty, arguing it could be a settlement for Eurasians. A motion entered by the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) and the Labour Party, which was accepted by parliament, stated that the declaration of Jonkman in parliament should become a part of the Linggadjati agreement. Duly accepted, the Netherlands thus unilaterally &#x27;amended&#x27; the Linggadjati agreement to the effect that New Guinea would remain Dutch. Labour parliamentary group leader Marinus van der Goes van Naters said afterwards the Labour Party entered the motion with the KVP because it feared the Catholics otherwise might reject the Linggadjati agreements.

The Indonesians did not accept this unilateral amendment. In order not to jeopardise the scheduled transfer of sovereignty, the Indonesian vice-president Mohammad Hatta offered to maintain Dutch sovereignty over New Guinea for one year and reopen the negotiations afterwards.

==1949–1956==
Thus in 1949, when the rest of the Dutch East Indies became fully independent as Indonesia, the Dutch retained sovereignty over western New Guinea, and took steps to prepare it for independence as a separate country. Some five thousand teachers were flown there. The Dutch put an emphasis upon political, business, and civic skills. On 8 February 1950, Stephan Lucien Joseph van Waardenburg was appointed the first Governor (&quot;De Gouverneur&quot;) of Dutch New Guinea. The first local naval cadets graduated in 1955 and the first army brigade become operational in 1956.

==1957–1961==

Tensions regarding the Dutch-Indonesian dispute over Dutch New Guinea escalated in December 1957 following Indonesia&#x27;s defeat in the UN General Assembly on 29 November 1957 to pass a resolution in favour of Indonesia&#x27;s claim to the territory. Sukarno responded by allowing the seizure of Dutch enterprises operating in Indonesia and announcing the intended expulsion of Dutch residents from Indonesia. The increased tensions surrounding the dispute encouraged the Dutch to accelerate their plans to move the disputed territory towards an act of self-determination. Elections were held in January 1961 and the New Guinea Council officially took office on 5 April 1961, to prepare for full independence by the end of that decade. The Dutch endorsed the council&#x27;s selection of a new national anthem and the Morning Star as the new national flag on 1 December 1961.

Following the raising of the Papuan National Flag on 1 December 1961, tensions further escalated. On 19 December 1961 Sukarno issued the &quot;Tri Komando Rakjat&quot; (People&#x27;s Triple Command), calling the Indonesian people to defeat the formation of an independent state of West Papua, raise the Indonesian flag in that country, and be ready for mobilisation at any time.

==Since 1962==
===Escalation to low-level conflict===
In 1962 Indonesia launched a significant campaign of airborne and seaborne infiltrations against the disputed territory, beginning with a seaborne infiltration launched by Indonesian forces on 15 January 1962. The Indonesian attack was comprehensively defeated by Dutch forces including the Dutch destroyers &quot;Evertsen&quot; and &quot;Kortenaer&quot;, the so-called Vlakke Hoek incident. Amongst the casualties was the Indonesian Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff; Commodore Yos Sudarso. Unbeknown to the Indonesians, Dutch Signals Intelligence had been able to intercept Indonesian communications, allowing Dutch forces to successfully anticipate Indonesia&#x27;s infiltration attempts throughout 1962. Forced to regroup, the Indonesians relaunched their campaign of infiltrations in March 1962. In the coming months over 500 Indonesian paratroops and special forces were covertly inserted into Dutch New Guinea, only to be decisively defeated by Dutch forces with the assistance of the indigenous population.

===Ellsworth Bunker proposal===
Facing mounting international diplomatic pressure and the prospect of an Indonesian invasion force, the Dutch conceded to re-entering negotiations and agreed to the Ellsworth Bunker proposal on 28 July 1962, for a staged transition from Dutch to Indonesian control via UN administration, on the condition that a plebiscite would be held in future in the territory. The agreement was signed on 15 August 1962 at the UN Headquarters in New York and the territory was placed under the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority in October 1962. It was subsequently transferred to Indonesia in May 1963.

The territory formally became part of Indonesia in 1969 after the Indonesian government, who shifted to New Order under President Suharto starting from 1966, conducted a nominally Bunker proposal-based plebiscite termed the Act of Free Choice. The result, which under strong pressure from the military, unanimously wanted to become part of Indonesia. The UN General Assembly later acknowledged the result via the .

<text>BBC BASIC is an interpreted version of the BASIC programming language. It was developed by Acorn Computers Ltd when they were selected by the BBC to supply the computer for their BBC Literacy Project in 1981.

It was originally supplied on an installed ROM for the BBC Microcomputer which used a 6502 microprocessor. When Acorn produced the Archimedes computer which used their ARM processor, further versions of BBC BASIC were produced. Acorn included a built in assembler, first for the 6502 and later for the ARM2 processor.

Initially the BBC specified compatibility with Microsoft BASIC. Acorn were already extending their earlier Atom BASIC to include structured programming constructs. Particularly on the later Archimedes computers as the memory constraints reduced, BBC BASIC incorporated a more complete set of structured programming constructs commonly found in the ALGOL 60 group of computer languages.

Alongside Acorn&#x27;s version of BBC BASIC on the Archimedes, third party companies produced compiled versions of the language. Development and support has continued after the demise of Acorn Computers Ltd for newer ARM based computers. BBC BASIC is now available on other platforms either for emulators such as on MS Windows or natively.

==History==

===Precursor languages===
Prior to 1957 programming was done using machine code or assembly language. These were specific to a processor and not portable.

Then high-level programming languages were developed to allow programs to be more easily transferred between computers:
*FORTRAN (short for FORmula TRANslation), developed by a team led by John Backus at IBM was commercially released in 1957.
*LISP (short for LISt Processing) invented by John McCarthy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1958.
*COBOL (short for COmmon-Business-Oriented Language) came from the 1959 Conference on Data Systems Languages at the University of Pennsylvania resulting in a compiler available in 1962.
*ALGOL 60 (short for ALGOrithmic Language) designed by an international committee of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The initial ALGOL 58 was followed by the publication of the Revised Report in 1960 (hence ALGOL 60).

Many more computer languages were developed during the 1960-1980 period. Few are now in regular use. Those more generally known were ALGOL W at Stanford University, Pascal plus POP-2 at the University of Edinburgh.

K&amp;R C was designed as the language to write the UNIX operating system. This was formalised as ANSI C from which C++ and JAVA were later derived.

At Dartmouth College two mathematics professors wanted all students to be able to program on their new College computer. The existing high-level languages were used by professionals. In 1964 they created Dartmouth BASIC (short for Beginner’s All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) to be a computer language anyone could use. Having a formula based syntactic structure it is a simplified FORTRAN.

Together, Paul Allen and Bill Gates developed BASIC for the Altair 8800. Development continued to become IBM&#x27;s BASIC A and Microsoft BASIC.

===BBC&#x27;s involvement===

During the 1970s, the BBC Continuing Education Department was considering how advancements in computer related technology would impact British society. Their Microelectronics Report in 1979 to the Manpower Services Commission describes formally their concerns about increasing polarisation and alienation in the workplace that 43 years earlier Charles Chaplin had shown to comic effect in Modern Times.

The BBC required a microcomputer usable for demonstrations in their programming that could be purchased by the general public to enable the viewer to themselves experiment. They decided that such a microcomputer needed to be robust, have expansion capabilities and an implementation of BASIC compatible with Microsoft BASIC VN5.

Jointly the government and the BBC established a public awareness and education campaign. This Computer Literacy Project (1980-1989) used the BBC&#x27;s choice of the BBC Microcomputer produced by Acorn Computers Ltd. BBC BASIC was central to the user programming experience.

===Acorn&#x27;s involvement===
Acorn first developed System BASIC and Atom BASIC for their early 6502 microprocessor computers that were sold to kit-build customers. With the development of the Proton as a Front-end processor, Acorn were designing for more powerful computing.

In order to produce a computer to satisfy the BBC specification, the Proton became the BBC Microcomputer, usable as a stand alone computer. By retaining the capability to be connected to a Z80 computer, Acorn was able to comply with the requirement of a computer supporting CP/M.

Sophie Wilson developed the implementations of BASIC at Acorn. The dialect on the BBC Microcomputer became compatible with Microsoft BASIC and so was acceptable to the BBC. It already had features from the ALGOL 60 group of computer languages that Wilson added to enable some structured programming methodology to be used.

==Platforms and versions==
===BBC Micro===
The full version list is available here:

BASIC I, the original version, was shipped on early BBC Micros.

BASIC II was used on the Acorn Electron and BBC Micros shipped after 1982, including the Model B. It added the codice_1 and codice_2 keywords, along with offset assembly and bug fixes.

BASIC III was produced in both a UK version and a United States market version for Acorn&#x27;s abortive attempt to enter the cross-Atlantic computer market. Apart from a few bug fixes, the only change from BASIC II was that the codice_3 command could also be spelled codice_4: regardless of which was input, the UK version always listed it as codice_3, the US version as codice_4. The main place that BASIC III can be found is as the HI-BASIC version for the external second processor.

BASIC IV, also known as CMOS BASIC, available on the BBC Master machines, was changed to use the new instructions available in the 65SC12 processor, reducing the size of the code and therefore allowing the inclusion of codice_7, codice_8 as a statement, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, | in codice_12 statements and faster floating point. Bug fixes were again included.

BASIC IV (1986) was a further improvement to BASIC IV, and was included on the Master Compact machine. The version of BASIC on the Compact included re-coded mathematical routines, said to provide a 30% speed increase over the version included in the rest of the Master series.

HI-BASIC was available in two versions, the first based on BASIC III, and the second based on BASIC IV. Both were built to run from a higher address (&amp;B800) on the second processor, rather than the usual &amp;8000 address on the BBC B. This allowed more program space to be available on either the external or internal 6502 second processors. A version was introduced to support a Zilog Z80 second processor.

Another version of BBC BASIC, called BAS128, was supplied on tape and disc with the BBC Master and Master Compact; it loaded into main RAM and used the 64 KB of Sideways RAM for user programs. This provided support for much larger programs at the cost of being a lot slower than the normal ROM-based version.

The interpreter can deal with both BASIC and 6502 assembly language, which can be included between the [ and ] characters. This contributed to the system&#x27;s popularity with industrial and research engineers.

====Further details/determining BASIC version====

As the BBC MOS and RISC OS were usually supplied on ROM, it may be assumed that a specific release of the operating system contained a specific version of BASIC. As such, there is no simple way to determine &quot;which&quot; version of BASIC is actually running other than by enquiring the operating system identity and thus making an assumption.

See also BeebWiki entry for INKEY.

On the BBC family, it is possible to run both the standard BASIC &quot;and&quot; an enhanced HIBASIC on the 6502 second processor. One may determine if the program is running on the second processor by examining the initial value of PAGE, it will be &amp;800 if using the second processor. To distinguish between BASIC and HIBASIC, one should examine the initial value of HIMEM. This will be &amp;8000 for BASIC running on the second processor, and &amp;B800 for HIBASIC on the second processor.

A similar situation exists on RISC OS where there may be the normal BASIC or BASIC64 (which offers higher precision maths). Normal BASIC identifies itself as &quot;BASIC V&quot; and BASIC64 identifies itself as &quot;BASIC VI&quot;, therefore the following (used before any error has occurred) will distinguish one from the other:

IF INSTR(REPORT$,&quot;VI&quot;) THEN PRINT &quot;BASIC64&quot; ELSE PRINT &quot;BASIC&quot;

There are better ways of doing this. See the BeebWiki. In almost all cases you shouldn&#x27;t need to be testing for what BASIC or platform your program is running on, just make the call and read whatever returned data are returned and deal with it.

===Acorn Archimedes (RISC OS)===

With the move to the 32-bit ARM CPU and the removal of the 16 KB limit on the BASIC code size many new features were added. BASIC V version 1.04 was 61 KB long. Current versions of RISC OS still contain a BBC BASIC V interpreter. The source code to the RISC OS 5 version of BBC BASIC V has been released under the Apache 2.0 license by RISC OS Open.

Amongst the new commands and features supported were:

* codice_13
* codice_14
* codice_15,
* codice_16 parameters in procedures,
* local arrays,
* procedure libraries (codice_17,codice_18 and codice_19),
* codice_20 and codice_21 handlers,
* a relative codice_22,
* array operations,
* new operators,
* codice_23,
* Commands for the new sound system, mouse, graphics.

The graphics commands were entirely backwards compatible, the sound less so; for example, the codice_24 keyword from BASIC V onwards is a command that takes fourteen numeric parameters and effectively does nothing— as in older versions, it calls OS_Word 8, but that does nothing on RISC OS. The in-line 6502 assembler was replaced by an ARM assembler. BASIC V was said, by Acorn, to be &quot;certainly the fastest interpreted BASIC in the world&quot; and &quot;probably the most powerful BASIC found on any computer&quot;.

BASIC VI is a version of BASIC V that supports IEEE 754 8-byte format real numbers, as opposed to the standard 5-byte format introduced in BASIC I.

BBC BASIC V and VI were delivered as standard on the Acorn Archimedes and the RiscPC. A version of BBC BASIC V was also available to run on the ARM second processor for the BBC Micro.

A compiler for BBC BASIC V was produced by Paul Fellows, team leader of the Arthur OS development, called the Archimedes BASIC Compiler and published initially by DABS Press. ABC was able to implement almost all of the language, with the obvious exception of the EVAL function, which inevitably required run-time programmatic interpretation. As evidence of its completeness, it was able to support inline assembler syntax. The compiler was written in BBC BASIC V. Many applications initially written to run under the interpreter benefitted from the performance boost that this gave, putting BBC BASIC V on a par with other languages for serious application development.

===Other platforms===
BBC BASIC has also been ported to many other platforms.

A NS32016 version of BBC BASIC was supplied with the Acorn 32016 coprocessor and Acorn ABC.

In addition to the version of BBC BASIC supplied with the BBC Micro&#x27;s Zilog Z80 second processor, a Z80-based version of BBC BASIC also exists for CP/M-based systems. 
A Zilog Z80 version of BBC BASIC was also used on the Tiki 100 desktop computer, Cambridge Z88 portable and the Amstrad NC100 Notepad and Amstrad NC200 Notebook computers. This version has been implemented on the TI-83 Plus and TI-84 Plus series graphing calculators. Due to efforts of J. G. Harston (also responsible for a PDP-11 version) a version of BBC BASIC for the ZX Spectrum was released in January 2002, with many improvements made in subsequent releases.

For PC-based systems, BBC BASIC was also implemented for DOS as &quot;BBCBASIC (86)&quot;, which aimed for maximum compatibility with the BBC Micro, and &quot;BBasic&quot;, which concentrated on the BASIC language, with its own enhancements based on BASIC II.

A version of BBC BASIC integrated with the Microsoft Windows graphical user interface, BBC BASIC for Windows created by Richard Russell, developer of the Z80 and x86 versions, was released in 2001. Whilst supporting nearly completely the original BBC BASIC specification (BASIC IV), the Windows version supports much of BASIC V/VI syntax as well as some advanced features of its own. Features unique to BBC BASIC for Windows include interpreter support for record/structure types, and the ability to call Windows API routines or those in an external DLL. Recent versions have included advanced features comparable with languages like C, and an external library has recently added support for objects.

BBC BASIC for SDL was also developed by Richard T. Russell, and is largely compatible with the previous BBC BASIC for Windows, sharing with that dialect many new and advanced features including data structures, PRIVATE variables, an EXIT statement, long strings, event interrupts, an address-of operator, byte variables, a line continuation character, indirect procedure and function calls and improved numeric accuracy. The first version was released in February 2019, and remains in active development . BBC BASIC for SDL 2.0 supports Windows, MacOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi OS, Android, iOS and mobile devices supporting the SDL library, as well as a version which allows the running of BBC BASIC programs as applets in a web-page via the Web Assembly framework. Programs can be run via the interpreter or compiled to a standalone application bundle which will run without BBC BASIC having to be installed (.exe file in Windows, .dmg file in MacOS, .zip file in Linux or Raspberry Pi OS and .apk file in Android). A high degree of compatibility with the BBC Microcomputer is also retained, including emulation of the SOUND and ENVELOPE statements, and the MODE 7 (teletext) screen mode. BBC BASIC for SDL 2.0 incorporates an assembler which depends on the CPU in the platform: x86 (32-bit or 64-bit) for Windows, MacOS or Linux; ARM (32-bit or 64-bit) for Raspberry Pi. In the case of Android the assembler is ARM or x86 as appropriate. Application Program Interface (API) functions can be accessed from BASIC and from assembler code, allowing an experienced programmer to produce sophisticated applications.

A GPL clone of BBC BASIC named &quot;Brandy&quot;, written in portable C, is also available. A fork of this, &quot;Matrix Brandy&quot;, remains under active development.

An emulator of the BBC Micro for the Commodore Amiga was produced by Ariadne Software for CBM (UK). While extremely fast, it did not emulate the 6502 at full speed, so assembly code would run slower than a real BBC while BASIC programs would run much faster. Due to the way the optimised BASIC and the 6502 emulation interacted, almost no commercial games would run but well-behaved code and educational software generally worked. Additionally, it used a slightly less precise floating-point numeric format. For a while it was bundled with a special academic package of the Amiga 500, in the hope that schools would replace their ageing BBC Bs with Amiga 500s.

A version of BBC BASIC V (Z80) has also been made for the TI-83/84+ Texas Instruments calculator families by Benjamin Ryves.

A Commodore 64 version &quot;Shado&quot; was produced by a small software house Aztec Software in the early 1980s. Patched versions of Acorn&#x27;s 6502 based HI-BASIC have also been experimentally run on C64, with an interface to the C64 Kernel, replacing the Acorn MOS calls otherwise made.

There have also been efforts to make 6502 based version of BBC BASIC available on the Apple II. Applecorn being one such effort.

BBC BASIC is the programming language used in the Agon Light, an open-sourced 8-bit Z80-based single board computer and microcontroller designed by Bernardo Kastrup and released in 2022.
