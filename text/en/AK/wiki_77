<text>Mons (; German and , ; Walloon and ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia, and the capital of the province of Hainaut, Belgium.

Mons was made into a fortified city by Count Baldwin IV of Hainaut in the 12th century. The population grew quickly, trade flourished, and several commercial buildings were erected near the Grand-Place. In 1814, King William I of the Netherlands increased the fortifications, following the fall of the First French Empire. The Industrial Revolution and coal mining made Mons a centre of heavy industry. In 1830, Belgium gained its independence and the decision was made to dismantle the fortifications, allowing the creation of large boulevards and other urban projects. In 1914, Mons was the location of the Battle of Mons. The British were forced to retreat by a numerically superior German force and the town remained occupied by the Germans until its liberation by the Canadian Corps during the final days of the war. There are several memorial placards related to the WW1 battles.

Today, the city is an important university town and commercial centre. The main square is the centre of the old city. It is paved in the manner of old cities and is home to many cafes and restaurants, as well as the Town Hall and Belfry. It is forbidden to park in or drive through the centre. Together with the Czech city of Plzeň, Mons was the European Capital of Culture in 2015.

== History ==

=== Early settlements ===

The first signs of activity in the region of Mons are found at Spiennes, where some of the best flint tools in Europe were found dating from the Neolithic period. When Julius Caesar arrived in the region in the 1st century BC, the region was settled by the Nervii, a Belgian tribe. A castrum was built in Roman (Belgica) times, giving the settlement its Latin name Castrilocus. The name was later changed into Montes for the mountain on which the castrum was built.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the 7th century, Saint Ghislain and two of his disciples built an oratory or chapel dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul near the Mons hill, at a place called Ursidongus, now known as Saint-Ghislain. Soon after, Saint Waltrude (in French &quot;Sainte Waudru&quot;), daughter of one of Chlothar II’s intendants, came to the oratory and was proclaimed a saint upon her death in 688. She was canonized in 1039.

Like Ath, its neighbour to the north-west, Mons was made a fortified city by Count Baldwin IV of Hainaut in the 12th century. The population grew quickly, trade flourished, and several commercial buildings were erected near the Grand-Place. The 12th century also saw the appearance of the first town halls. The city had 4,700 inhabitants by the end of the 13th century. Mons succeeded Valenciennes as the capital of the county of Hainaut in 1295 and grew to 8,900 inhabitants by the end of the 15th century. In the 1450s, Matheus de Layens took over the construction of the Saint Waltrude church from Jan Spijkens and restored the Town Hall.

=== From 1500 to 1800 ===
In 1515, Charles V took an oath in Mons as Count of Hainaut. In this period of its history, the city became the target of various occupations, starting in May 1572 with the Protestant takeover by Louis of Nassau, who had hoped to clear the way for the French Protestant leader Gaspard de Coligny to oppose Spanish rule. After the murder of de Coligny during the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, the Duke of Alba took control of Mons in September 1572 in the name of the Catholic King of Spain. This spelled the ruin of the city and the arrest of many of its inhabitants; from 1580 to 1584, Mons became the capital of the Southern Netherlands.

On 8 April 1691, after a nine-month siege, Louis XIV’s army stormed the city, which again suffered heavy casualties. From 1697 to 1701, Mons was alternately French or Austrian. After being under French control from 1701 to 1709, the Dutch and British armies gained the upper hand in the Battle of Malplaquet and the Siege of Mons in 1709. In 1715, Mons returned to Austria under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). But the French did not give up easily; Louis XV besieged the city again in 1746. After the Battle of Jemappes (1792), the Hainaut area was annexed to France and Mons became the capital of Jemappes.

=== From 1800 to the present ===
Following the fall of the First French Empire in 1814, King William I of the Netherlands fortified the city heavily. In 1830, however, Belgium gained its independence and the decision was made to dismantle fortified cities such as Mons, Charleroi, and Namur. The actual removal of fortifications only happened in the 1860s, allowing the creation of large boulevards and other urban projects. The Industrial Revolution and coal mining made Mons a center of heavy industry, which strongly influenced the culture and image of the Borinage region as a whole. It was to become an integral part of the &quot;sillon industriel&quot;, the industrial backbone of Wallonia.

==== Riots of Mons ====
On 17 April 1893, between Mons and Jemappes, seven strikers were killed by the civic guard at the end of the Belgian general strike of 1893. This general strike was one of the first general strikes in an industrial country. The proposed law on universal suffrage was approved the day after by the Belgian Parliament.

==== Battle of Mons ====

On 2324 August 1914, Mons was the location of the Battle of Mons—the first battle fought by the British Army in World War I. The British were forced to retreat with just over 1,600 casualties, and the town remained occupied by the Germans until its liberation in the Second Battle of Mons by the Canadian Corps during the final days of the war.

Within the front entrance to the City Hall, there are several memorial placards related to the First World War battles and in particular, one has the inscription:


==== Second World War ====
During the Second World War, as an important industrial centre, the city was heavily bombed. During the Battle of the Mons Pocket US Army forces encircled and took 25,000 Germans prisoner in early September 1944.

==== After 1945 ====
After the war, most industries went into decline.

NATO&#x27;s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) was relocated in Casteau, a village near Mons, from Rocquencourt on the outskirts of Paris after France&#x27;s withdrawal from the military structure of the alliance in 1967. The relocation of SHAPE to this particular region of Belgium was largely a political decision, based in large part on the depressed economic conditions of the area at the time with the view to bolstering the economy of the region. A riot in the prison of Mons took place in April 2006 after prisoner complaints concerning living conditions and treatment; no deaths were reported as a result of the riot, but the event focused attention on prisons throughout Belgium. Today, the city is an important university town and commercial centre.

== Geography ==

The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Ciply, Cuesmes, Flénu, Ghlin, Harmignies, Harveng, Havré, Hyon, Jemappes, Maisières, Mesvin, Mons proper, Nimy, Nouvelles, Obourg, Saint-Denis, Saint-Symphorien, Spiennes, and Villers-Saint-Ghislain.

== Demographics ==
== Festivities ==
* The Ducasse de Mons or &quot;Doudou&quot; is the name of a week-long series of festivities, which originates from the 14th century and takes place every year on Trinity Sunday. Highlights include:
** The entrusting of the reliquary of Saint Waltrude to the mayor of the city on the eve of the procession.
** The placement of the reliquary on the &quot;Car d&#x27;Or&quot; (&quot;Golden Chariot&quot;), before it is carried in the city streets in a colourful procession that counts more than a thousand costumed participants.
** The lifting of the &quot;Car d&#x27;Or&quot; on a paved area near the Collegiate Church of St. Waudru; tradition holds that this operation must be successful for the city to prosper.
** The &quot;Lumeçon&quot; fight, where Saint George confronts the dragon. The fight lasts for about half an hour, accompanied by the rhythmic &quot;Doudou&quot; music. The tradition of the processional dragon is listed among the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
Tanks in town commemorates the liberation of Belgium during World War II by the American 3rd Armored Division, and is one of the world&#x27;s largest gatherings of WWII tanks.

== Education ==
There are several public educational facilities in Mons:
* , &quot;CRM&quot;
* UCLouvain FUCaM Mons, a campus of the University of Louvain located in Mons since 1899.
* University of Mons, UMons, founded in 2009 by a merger between the Faculté polytechnique de Mons and the University of Mons-Hainaut.
* Institut Reine Astrid Mons
* Collège Saint-Stanislas, founded in 1851.

== Transportation ==
Mons is located along the N56 road. It is also accessed via European route E42, which is a continuation of French Autoroute A2, linking the British WW1 battlefields of Mons with the Somme Battlefields,

Mons railway station opened on 19 December 1841.

A small, general aviation airfield Saint-Ghislain Airport is located nearby for private aircraft.

== Climate ==
Mons has a typical Belgian oceanic climate with relatively narrow temperature differences between seasons for its inland 50° latitude, as a result of Gulf Stream influence.

== Sports ==
The town hosts a professional basketball team called Belfius Mons-Hainaut and a tennis tournament called the Ethias Trophy. It previously hosted the football club R.A.E.C. Mons, though the team has since disbanded. There is also a horse racing venue at Hippodrome de Wallonie in Mons.

== Planning and architectural heritage ==

The centre consists largely of red brick houses. Although there are few old buildings and rarely new blue stone buildings, its use is generally limited to parts of the decorative walls. Much of the centre is made up of houses which are two or three storeys high. 
In commercial areas, the ground floor is used as commercial space, while other floors are used for housing. Generally behind the houses there is a small garden.

The outskirts of the city are also generally made of brick terraced houses. They nevertheless have the largest green spaces in the front or rear. In more remote areas of the centre, there are four façades of the villas.

After the Second World War the city experienced rather limited construction of buildings. Some public housing have been built in Ghlin, Hyon Jemappes and in the suburbs of the city. Since the late 1990s and especially since the arson which took place in one of these buildings, the city undertook a policy of deconstruction of these houses which is still in progress at the moment. A whole series of social buildings are evenly dispersed in the downtown and surrounding suburbs.

16,5% of the city&#x27;s population lives in apartments (17% in Belgium) and 82.7% in single-family homes (82.3% in Belgium). Of the 82.7% who live in single family homes, only 26% (37.3% in Belgium) are separate houses, while 55.7% (44.4 in Belgium) are detached or terraced houses. That&#x27;s pretty much a small town in Belgium. Large municipalities have in fact fewer single family homes, but many more apartments whereas the smallest towns have few apartments and a lot of single family homes. The figures show very clearly the strong presence of terraced houses rather than separate houses: it exemplifies the urbanization of downtown, but also urban cores such as Jemappes et Cuesmes.

=== Grand-Place ===
The Grand-Place is the centre of the old city. It is situated near the shopping street (pedestrian) and the Belfry. It is paved in the manner of old cities and is home to many cafes and restaurants, as well as the Town Hall. The outskirts of the square are accessible by car, but it is forbidden to park or drive through the centre. Each year, the square is used as an action theatre called &quot;Lumeçon&quot; to stage a battle between Saint George and Dragon. The Grand-Place is also equipped with a fountain, which opened on 21 March 2006. It also hosts a Christmas market and sometimes an ice rink during the winter holiday period.

The façade of the building called &quot;au Blan Levrie&quot; shows the care with which the city attempted to unite the old and the modern. It is the first authorised building in the main square which was made of stone to avoid fire incidents. It was originally built in 1530 in the Gothic style, for the Malaperts, a wealthy local family. In 1975, the architects A. Godart and O. Dupire were assigned to design a bank. They proceeded to gut the interior and conduct a precise survey of the whole before beginning the restoration project. The façade was completely restored, sometimes (as below) by extending the design of mouldings, but the fenestration proved impossible to restore as there were not enough clues from the remains of the original to do so. Therefore, &quot;The choice was directed towards a contemporary discrete [style], appearing in second test [?]: they are steel frame whose profiles are thinner. » Impression yet reinforced by the way of which was treated at the entrance gate.[?]&quot;

=== City Hall ===
==== History ====
Originally its communal organization, Mons was a City Hall called &quot;House of Peace.&quot; Earlier the deputy mayors were on the castle of the Counts of Hainaut, and now it is only the conciergerier, Saint-Calixte chapel and some underground rooms and the chamber. This place is now Castle Park, where we can also see the Belfry. Already in the 13th century, the counts mentioned the House of Peace, located in the Rue Nimy. Other documents of the same time let one suppose that there existed two Houses of Peace, the one in the Rue Nimy and the other in the market area.

It was in 1323 that Count William I gave permission to build the House of Peace on the location of the current City Hall. This is called a &quot;Town House&quot; built of stones and bricks at the base, while the superstructure is of wood. This building underwent various changes during the 15th century until 1477, when the nearby shop in the arsenal exploded.

==== Current City Hall ====
The destroyed buildings were rebuilt and benefitted from new changes and additions over the centuries.

The architect of the City Hall, Matthew Layens of Leuven, was called to draw up plans. It was to be a building in Gothic style, but it seems that the plan (which was not found) was not completed, including the abandonment of the second floor, which was still intended for construction. The Renaissance campanile was added in the 18th century. It contains a bell dating from 1390, the Bancloque, and carries a clock dial overlooking the Grand-Place and a light clock. The 19th century saw various modifications of the façade, the removal of stone mullions to the floor and various stone ornaments.

In its current state, the Town Hall consists of a remarkable collection of various buildings housing a large proportion of municipal services. These buildings have undergone many changes over the centuries, restorations and additions of elements from other buildings, such as a Gothic style fireplace from castle Trazegnies, carved doors of the 16th century saved from demolition, a fireplace from the castle of Gouy-lez-Pedestrian, and another fireplace in 1603 from the Château d&#x27;Havré.

On 23 April 2006 was inaugurated a bronze statuary group by Garouste Gerard, creator of a fresco for the wedding hall. The work, evoking the combat of St. George and the dragon, is in front of City Hall at the bottom of the stair-ramps providing access to one of the entrances to City Hall.
==== Mayor&#x27;s Garden ====

These buildings surround a small, irregularly shaped square, the Mayor&#x27;s Garden, from which the Rue d&#x27;Enghien descends. The Ropieur Fountain, by sculptor Léon Gobert (1869–1935), can be found in the middle of the square. The symbolizes a young insolent resident of Mons, drenching passersby with water from the fountain.

=== Saint Waltrude Collegiate Church ===
Although located in the heart of the old County of Hainaut, the Saint Waltrude Collegiate Church is one of the most characteristic churches and most homogeneous of Brabantine Gothic architecture.

The collegiate was built in the 15th century on the orders of canons. Along with the nearby Belfry, it is considered as a major symbol of the city of Mons. It contains many works of Jacques du Broeucq.

It is made of local materials like sandstone, blue stone and brick. It is designed in a classic form, which is expressed by a Latin cross sign. It measures 115 metres long, 32 metres wide and rises to 24.5 metres at the keystone. The chancel is surrounded by an ambulatory and 15 chapels.

=== Belfry ===
Also called El Catiau by Montois, it was built in the 17th century. The Belfry is the only Baroque style building in Belgium that reaches a height of 87 meters. In its top section it contains a 49 bell carillon. It was classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 1 December 1999, as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site.

Victor Hugo described the Belfry in a letter to his wife as &quot;a coffeepot flanked by four smaller teapots.&quot;

=== Press House (Spanish House) ===
The Press House dates back to the 16th century and is a rare example of a house in traditional Spanish style in Mons. It is made in a simple architectural way using brick. This material was economical and used after the fire in 1548, because when it was rebuilt, the cost of stone had increased. In 1548, the deputy mayor had prohibited the use of flammable materials.

The buildings were restored in 19191920, on the plans of the communal architect E. Bertiaux and are occupied by the Maison de la Presse.

=== Water machine ===
This industrial hall is all that remains of the &quot;machine&quot; that supplied Mons with drinkable water from 1871, the year when the river Trouille was diverted. Designed by the architect Hubert and the engineer Celi Moullan, this impressive machinery of pipes and mains was built in metal and glass and forced the water from the valley level up to the town water tanks in the castle place yard. To source the water, Mons purchased two springs known as the &quot;Mouse Hole&quot; and &quot;La Vallière,&quot; and the water was transported via hydraulic motor.

The &quot;water machine&quot; still bears witness to the sanitary and hygiene concerns which arose in Mons in 1865-1870 and marks the transition from medieval water supply wells, springs and hand pumps, to operation of pumps suction and force.

This progress at domestic level transformed the townspeople&#x27;s way of life and changed the boundaries of Mons and Spiennes. They used to get water from wells or fountains, sometimes over a hundred yards from their homes. Soon followed another urban project: the introduction in 1828 of city gas to illuminate new avenues and streets. These two changes are made possible by the demolition of the fortifications, which releases the land, and the diversion of Trouille including the strategic role of supply ditches was then passed.

The &quot;water machine&quot; was restored in the early 1990s, and the building now hosts various cultural events. The machinery was dismantled.

=== Waux Hall ===

Waux Hall park was built in the 19th century (1862–1864) at the initiative of the Society of Waux Hall created for this purpose by members of the bourgeoisie. It is therefore the source of a private park. It is located at the site of Fort said that the Dutch formed an outwork the last fortification (1815–1864). Remnants of the fort still exist under the current pavillon. The gardens were designed by Louis Fuchs and the central pavilion was built by architect Joseph Hubert in tavern style.
A 5 hectare landscaped park was built in the mid 19th century and consists of various species of age-old trees, water features, lakes and lawns. A Turkish hazel is one of the remarkable trees in the park. Various memorials and outdoor sculptures, including works of sculptors Grard, Deville, Hupet, and Guilmot Harvent, are placed.

The Technical and Vocational School of Horticulture was established in 1863, it was installed under the authority of the corporation of Waux Hall. It became communal in 1892 at the time of acquisition of Waux Hall by the city of Mons, and then came under the authority of the province of Hainaut in 2006. In 2009 this event was moved to the Grand-Place.

=== Parfaite Union ===

The masonic Lodge &quot;La Parfaite Union&quot; is the oldest in Belgium and perhaps even on the continent. It was founded in 1721. At that time, Mons became a masonic centre followed by the creation of several new lodges (Vraie et parfaite harmonie (1767), À l&#x27;Orient de Mons (1783) et la Ligue équitable (1786).

After the French Revolution, the meetings were held in different locations, and an event was organised by the &quot;Parfaite Union&quot; for the construction of a permanent building. The plans of the architect Hector Puchot were retained in 1890. The neo-Egyptian style then became a reference for Masonic architecture, and we can consider the lodge of Mons as a model of its kind with its numerous motifs—&quot;Egyptian&quot; papyrus capitals, frieze lotus bud, etc.

=== Carré des Arts ===

The William Barracks, renamed the Major Sabbe Barracks after the First World War and since the 1990s called the Carré des Arts, dates from 1824 to 1827, at the time of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is the work of the architect Rémi de Puydt (1789–1844). The façade and roof of the building were listed in 1983 on the advice of the Royal Commission of Monuments, Sites and Excavations.

Maintaining its military purpose until the late 1940s, the building was then used by the Royal Grammar School John Avesnes from the 1960s to the early 1990s. Since the completion of the conversion carried out between 1993 and 1995, the Carré des Arts hosts the Graduate School of Arts and visual (ESAPV) and regional television TV Borinage Mons (Tele MB).

=== Rouge-Puits ===

Three wells, fountains that decorated the streets of Mons have survived until today. This is the case of the fountain-pillory, Louis XVI style, built in 1779 by the blue stone Ouvertus architect.

Built in 1831 by Albert Jamot, this well was transferred to the central Marché-aux-Herbes in 1877 and has served as a fountain after the development of the water supply in the city during the years 18691870. It has regained its original location at the corner of the Coupe and the Chaussée in 1981. After the Marché aux Herbes, the fountain (not connected to the water) was placed for a few years in the park at the far end of the Rue des Quatre Fils Aymon.

=== Casemates ===

The casemates and the bakery are the remains of military fortifications dating from the kingdom of the Netherlands (1814–1830). The law dividing the disassembly of the fortifications dates back to 1861. They are located near the Nervienne site. The roof of the old bakery has been transformed into a public park and playground for children, while the casemates accommodate the musée de la Route.

=== Valenciennoise Tower ===

This is the last existing trace of the medieval walls surrounding the city. This defensive structure built of sandstone from Bray was built around 1358. Its walls equipped with loopholes have a thickness of up to 4 meters. The tower has lost about a third of its original size. A project to install a terrace on its top open to the public had just been completed in 2009. The tower has housed a sound installation in the festival of contemporary art audio-visual CitySonics when it reopened.

=== Concourse of the Courts ===
In 1966, the Council of Ministers decided to build new buildings to house the Courts of Justice: Assize Court, Labour Court, Court of Appeal, Court of Commerce, etc. The choice is the site of the former &quot;Hall of exposure&quot;. The Building Authority designated as architects for the project the Office Aura (John Bartholomew). The triangular shape of the land has created interior spaces, decreasing in height and width, forming a sort of &quot;cathedral space&quot; underlined by a continuous central luminous line. On this major axis, the &quot;backbone&quot; of the project, has created spaces for encounter and relaxation. The latest techniques have been implemented for the economic management of energy, giving maximum comfort to staff and the public while ensuring the development of architectural building.

Opened in May 2007, by January 2011 all buildings already had developed many problems of water seepage and stability. Thus one of the gateways weighing a hundred kilos came off its hinges and nearly fell on a lawyer who entered, cracks opened between concrete blocks, the joints of windows let in wind and water when it rains in the concourse, etc. The lack of any maintenance contracts might be a significant cause of these problems, since minor problems might otherwise have been prevented from getting worse.

<text>Bharatanātyam is an Indian classical dance form that originated in Tamil Nadu, India. It is a classical dance form recognized by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, and expresses South Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas of Hinduism and Jainism.

A description of precursors of &quot;Bharatanatyam&quot; from the Natya Shastra dated around (500 BCE) and in the ancient Tamil epic &quot;Silappatikaram&quot; dated around (171 CE), while temple sculptures of the 6th to 9th century CE suggest dance was a refined performance art by the mid-1st millennium CE. Sadiraattam, which was renamed Bharatanatyam in 1932, is the oldest classical dance tradition in India. 

&quot;Bharatanatyam&quot; contains different types of &quot;bani&quot;. &quot;Bani&quot;, or &quot;tradition&quot;, is a term used to describe the dance technique and style specific to a guru or school, often named for the village of the guru. &quot;Bharatanatyam&quot; style is noted for its fixed upper torso, bent legs, and flexed knees (&quot;Aramandi&quot;) combined with footwork, and a vocabulary of sign language based on gestures of hands, eyes, and face muscles. The dance is accompanied by music and a singer, and typically the dancer&#x27;s guru is present as the &quot;nattuvanar&quot; or director-conductor of the performance and art. The performance repertoire of Bharatanatyam, like other classical dances, includes &quot;nrita&quot; (pure dance), &quot;nritya&quot; (Conveys a meaning to the audience through hand gestures) and &quot;natya&quot; (Consists of the elements of drama). A program of bharatanatyam usually lasts two hours without interruption and includes a specific list of procedures, all performed by one dancer, who does not leave the stage or change costume. The accompanying orchestra—composed of drums, drone, and singer—occupies the back of the stage, led by the guru, or the teacher, of the dancer.

Sadiraattam remained exclusive to Hindu temples through the 19th century. It was banned by the colonial British government in 1910, but the Indian community protested against the ban and expanded its performance outside temples in the 20th century as Bharatanatyam. Modern stage productions of Bharatanatyam have become popular throughout India and include performances that are purely dance-based on non-religious ideas and fusion themes. The Thanjavur Quartet developed the basic structure of modern Bharatanatyam by formalizing it.

==Etymology==
In 1932, E Krishna Iyer and Rukmini Devi Arundale put forward a proposal to rename &quot;Sadiraattam&quot; (), also known as &quot;Parathaiyar Aattam or Thevarattam&quot;, as &quot;Bharatanatyam&quot;, to give the dance form a measure of respect, at a meeting of the Madras Music Academy. They also were instrumental in modifying mainly the Pandanallur style of dance. The word &quot;Bharatam&quot; comes from the term &quot;Bharat&quot; which is the Sanskrit name for India.

==History==

The theoretical foundations of dance Bharatanatyam are found first in &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, a Sanskrit text of performance arts and later in a Tamil text called Kootha nool taken from Tholkappiyam (250 BCE).

&quot;Natya Shastra&quot; is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni, and its first complete compilation is dated to between 500 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. Richmond et al. estimate the &quot;Natasutras&quot; to have been composed around 600 BCE. The most studied version of the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of &quot;Tāṇḍava&quot; dance (Shiva), the theory of &quot;rasa&quot;, of &quot;bhāva&quot;, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures—all of which are part of Indian classical dances. Dance and performance arts, states this text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.

Historical references to dance are found in the Tamil epics &quot;Silappatikaram&quot; (c. 2nd century CE) and &quot;Manimegalai&quot; (c. 6th century). The ancient text &quot;Silappatikaram&quot;, includes a story of a dancing girl named Madhavi; it describes the dance training regimen called &quot;Arangatrau Kathai&quot; of Madhavi in verses 113 through 159. The carvings in Kanchipuram&#x27;s Shiva temple that have been dated to 6th to 9th century CE suggest dance was a well-developed performance art by about the mid 1st millennium CE.

A famous example of illustrative sculpture is in the southern gateway of the Chidambaram temple (≈12th century) dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, where 108 poses, described as karanas in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, are carved in stone.

Bharatanatyam shares the dance poses of many ancient Shiva sculptures in Hindu temples. The Cave 1 of the Badami cave temples of Karnataka, dated back to the 7th century portrays the &quot;Tandava&quot; dancing Shiva as Nataraja. The image, tall, has 18 arms in a form that expresses the dance positions arranged in a geometric pattern. The arms of Shiva express &quot;mudras&quot; (symbolic hand gestures), that are used in Bharatanatyam. The early 12th century ancient Sanskrit text Manasollasa discusses about the dancing movements like Natya, Tandava, Lasya, Laghu, Visama and Vikata, This discussion is similar to the content found in Natya Shastra. 

===Devadasis, anti-dance movement, colonial ban, and the decline===
Some colonial Indologists and modern authors have argued that Bharatanatyam is a descendant of an ancient &quot;Devadasi&quot; () culture, suggesting a historical origin back to between 300 BCE and 300 CE. Modern scholars have questioned this theory for lack of any direct textual or archeological evidence. Historic sculptures and texts do describe and project dancing girls, as well as temple quarters dedicated to women, but they do not state them to be courtesans and prostitutes as alleged by early colonial Indologists. According to Davesh Soneji, a critical examination of evidence suggests that courtesan dancing is a phenomenon of the modern era, beginning in the late 16th or the 17th century of the Nayaka period of Tamil Nadu. According to James Lochtefeld, classical dance remained exclusive to Hindu temples through the 19th century, only in the 20th century appearing on stage outside the temples. Further, the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom patronized classical dance.

With the arrival of the East India Company in the 18th century, and British colonial rule in the 19th, classical Indian dance forms were ridiculed and discouraged, and these performance arts declined. Christian missionaries and British officials presented &quot;nautch girls&quot; of north India (Kathak) and &quot;devadasis&quot; of south India (Bharatanatyam) as evidence of &quot;harlots, debased erotic culture, slavery to idols and priests&quot; tradition, and Christian missionaries demanded that this must be stopped, launching the &quot;anti-dance movement&quot; in 1892. The anti-dance camp accused the dance form as a front for prostitution, while revivalists questioned the constructed colonial histories.

In 1910, the Madras Presidency of the British Empire banned temple dancing, and with it the classical dance tradition in Hindu temples.

The banning of temple dancing stemmed from the 1892 anti-dance movement and new, liberal colonial perspectives. What the English imagined nineteenth-century modernity to be did not include what they regarded Bharatanatyam to be, which they regarded as indecent. Coming from a deep orientalist perspective, the morality of people who performed Bharatanatyam was called into question. Accusations of prostitution were thrown around. Some women from traditionally performing communities were used as a way to showcase obscenity. New reforms disregarded local issues like production of the arts for the sake of liberalism and felt able to impose disruptive reforms that reshaped lives at all levels and subjected people to new standards. Colonial reforms were largely unsympathetic to local traditions, and dismissive of the industry surrounding producing art. The adoption of Anglo-Indian laws that imposed certain restrictions and regulations on certain expressions of sexuality, and more so regulations on bodies and sex in general, which in turn affected traditional dance practices. Temple dancing became caught in a web of multiple political agendas, hoping to bend this burgeoning morality issue to suit their cause. Colonial denunciations of the practice of temple dancing were caught up in liberal ideals of bringing modernity to India, where modernity was tied to Anglo-Protestant moral ideas about how bodies are viewed and how sexuality was presented.

===Post-colonial revival===

The 1910 ban triggered protests against the stereotyping and dehumanization of temple dancers. Tamil people were concerned that a historic and rich dance tradition was being victimized under the excuse of social reform. Classical art revivalists such as E. Krishna Iyer, a lawyer who had learned from traditional practitioners of Sadir, questioned the cultural discrimination and the assumed connection, asking why prostitution needs years of training for performance arts, and how killing performance arts could end any evils in society. Iyer was arrested and sentenced to prison on charges of nationalism, who while serving out his prison term persuaded his fellow political prisoners to support Bharatanatyam.

While the British colonial government enforced laws to suppress Hindu temple dances, some from the West, such as the American dancer Esther Sherman moved to India in 1930, learned Indian classical dances, changed her name to Ragini Devi, and joined the movement to revive Bharatanatyam and other ancient dance arts.

The Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, already in progress, became a period of cultural foment and initiated an effort by its people to reclaim their culture and rediscover history. In this period of cultural and political turmoil, Bharatanatyam was revived as a mainstream dance outside of Hindu temples by artists such as Rukmini Devi Arundale, Balasaraswati and Yamini Krishnamurti They championed and performed the Pandanallur style and Thanjavur styles of Bharatanatyam.

Nationalist movements that brought revitalizing devadasis up as an issue to focus on viewed it as a way to critique the imposition of colonial morality on India. However, the revival movement was not without Western influence. Nationalist movements that also focused on devadasis revival were influenced by Western ideas of democratization of arts. Part of the revival movement was making the opportunity to dance open to more people. Nationalist movements that focused on revival were also influenced by Western ideology through their propagation that part of the revival movement is a reassertion of traditional values, as well as a moment to remind people of the country’s cultural heritage and reestablish a sense of identity. Fighting for freedom from the British and fighting for civil liberties included debates about morality, and how gender impacts morality. The revival movement moralized devadasis by democratizing the art, while also decorating it with the female performing class. Figures like Rukmini Devi Arundale, who are credited with revitalizing Bharatanatyam, also shifted the practice to appeal to middle to upper-class women. Rukmini Devi Arundale is credited with helping develop the Kalakshetra style of Bharatanatyam. There was an emphasis on building a modern India through Indian nationalism, which tied in with protecting traditional artistic traditions. The decommercialization and sanitation of Bharatanatyam for the sake of protecting the spirit of the art is part of Bharatanatyam’s revival. Bharatanatyam’s successful revival meant that it was regarded as a classical dance tradition specific to India, as opposed to a cultural dance that had been changed by colonial censorship. It was becoming a modern nation to have a traditional dance that was practiced recreationally and was nationally recognized. With the standardization of Bharatanatyam, there came books based on historic texts, like Natya Shastra, which described the different movements. Evidence of a successful revival movement of Bharatanatyam through Indian Nationalist movements was the introduction of state-sponsored dance festivals in 1955 in an independent India. These festivals were put on to display art with religious, social, and cultural connotations that have some regional diversity on a common national platform.

In the late 20th century, Tamil Hindu migrants reintroduced the traditions of temple dancing in British Tamil temples.

==Elements==
Bharatanatyam is traditionally a team performance art that consists of a solo dancer, accompanied by musicians and one or more singers. It is described as classical art because the theory of musical notes, vocal performance, and the dance movement reflect ideas of the Sanskrit treatise &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; and other Sanskrit and Tamil texts, such as the &quot;Abhinaya Darpana&quot;.

The solo artist (&quot;ekaharya&quot;) in Bharatanatyam is dressed in a colorful sari, adorned with jewelry and presents a dance and it is synchronized with Indian classical music. The hand and facial gestures are a coded sign language able to recite legends and spiritual ideas from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the Puranas and historic drama texts. The dancer deploys turns or specific body movements to mark punctuations in the story or the entry of a different character in the play or legend being acted out through dance. &quot;Abhinaya&quot; is the art of expression in Indian aesthetics; footwork, body language, postures, musical notes, the tones of the vocalist, aesthetics and costumes integrate to express and communicate the underlying text.

In modern adaptations, Bharatanatyam dance troupes may involve many dancers who play specific characters in a story, creatively choreographed to ease the interpretation and expand the experience by the audience.

The repertoire of Bharatanatyam, like all major classical Indian dance forms, follows the three categories of performance in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. These are &quot;Nritta&quot; (Nirutham), &quot;Nritya&quot; (Niruthiyam) and &quot;Natya&quot; (Natyam).
*The &quot;Nritta&quot; performance is an abstract, fast, and rhythmic aspect of the dance. The viewer is presented with pure movement in Bharatanatyam, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range, and pattern. This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of the story. It is a technical performance and aims to engage the senses (Prakriti) of the audience.
*The &quot;Nritya&quot; is a slower and more expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, and storyline, particularly with spiritual themes in Hindu dance traditions. In a &quot;nritya&quot;, the dance-acting expands to include silent expression of words through gestures and body motion set to musical notes. The actor articulates a legend or a spiritual message. This part of a Bharatanatyam repertoire is more than sensory enjoyment, it aims to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer.
*The &quot;Natyam&quot; is a play, typically a team performance, but can be acted out by a solo performer where the dancer uses certain standardized body movements to indicate a new character in the underlying story. A &quot;Natya&quot; incorporates the elements of a &quot;Nritya&quot;.

=== Arangetram ===

A Bharatanatyam arangetram is a solo debut performance that signifies the completion of initial formal training of a young dancer, female or male in Indian classical dance. The term &quot;Arangetram&quot; translates to &quot;ascending the stage&quot;. This performance is typically done ten to twelve years after a dancer begins learning Bharatanatyam. Still, more importantly, it is done when the guru believes the student is ready for a solo performance. This solo debut is synonymous with a &quot;coming-of-age&quot; celebration. The arangetram is a culmination of multiple years of hard work by the student and the guru, and it is an opportunity for the dancer to showcase his or her dedication and skills developed over the years. Throughout this debut, the dancer performs a series of dances. The dancer must build up his or her concentration and stamina to perform solo dances for approximately three hours. Each dance performed symbolizes various aspects of Hindu religion.

==== Sequence of dances ====

A traditional Bharatanatyam arangetram dance performance follows a seven to eight-part order of presentation. This set is called &quot;Margam&quot;.

Pushpanjali

The Arangetram performance typically begins with a dance called the &quot;Pushpanjali&quot;, which translates to &quot;offering of flowers&quot;. In this dance, the performer offers flowers and salutations to the Hindu deities, the guru, and the audience as a mark of respect. The beginning of the dance symbolizes supplication, from which the dancer then commences the rest of the performance.

Alarippu

The presentation can also begin with a rhythmic invocation (&quot;vandana&quot;) called the &quot;Alarippu&quot;. It is a pure dance, which combines a thank you and benediction for blessings from the gods and goddesses, the guru and the gathered performance team. It also serves as a preliminary warm-up dance, without melody, to enable the dancer to loosen their body, and journey away from distractions and towards single-minded focus.

Jatiswaram

The next stage of the performance adds melody to the movement of &quot;Alarippu&quot;, and this is called &quot;Jatiswaram&quot;. The dance remains a prelim technical performance (&quot;nritta&quot;), pure in form and without any expressed words. The drums set the beat, of any Carnatic music &quot;raga&quot; (melody). They perform a sequence (&quot;Korvai&quot;) to the rhythm of the beat, presenting to the audience the unity of music, rhythm and movements.

Shabdam

The performance sequence then adds &quot;Shabdam&quot; (expressed words). This is the first item of Margam where expressions are introduced. The solo dancer, the vocalist(s), and the musical team, in this stage of the production, present short compositions, with words and meaning, in a spectrum of moods. This performance praises God (such as Krishna, Shiva, Rama, and Murugan) and their qualities.

Varnam

The performance thereafter evolves into the &quot;Varnam&quot; stage. This marks the arrival into the sanctum sanctorum core of the performance. It is the longest section and the &quot;nritya&quot;. A traditional Varnam may be as long as 30–45 minutes or sometimes an hour. Varnam offers huge scope for improvisation and an experienced dancer can stretch the Varnam to a desirable length. The artist presents the play or the main composition, reveling in all their movements, silently communicating the text through codified gestures and footwork, harmoniously with the music, rhythmically punctuated. The dancer performs complicated moves, such as expressing a verse at two speeds. Their hands and body tell a story, whether of love and longing or of a battle between the good and the evil, as the musicians envelop them with musical notes and tones that set the appropriate mood.

Padam

The &quot;Padam&quot; is next. This is the stage of reverence, of simplicity, of &quot;abhinaya&quot; (expression) of the solemn spiritual message or devotional religious prayer (bhakti). The music is lighter, the chant intimate, the dance emotional. The choreography attempts to express &quot;rasa&quot; (emotional taste) and a mood, while the recital may include items such as a keertanam (expressing devotion), a &quot;javali&quot; (expressing divine love) or something else.

Tillana

The performance sequence ends with a &quot;Tillana&quot;, the climax. It closes out the &quot;nritya&quot; portion, the movements exit the temple of expressive dance, returning to the &quot;nritta&quot; style, where a series of pure movement and music are rhythmically performed. Therewith the performance ends.

Shlokam or Mangalam

The seventh and final item in the sequence can be either a &quot;Shlokam&quot; or a &quot;Mangalam&quot;. The dancer calls for blessings on the people all around.

The overall sequence of Bharatanatyam, states Balasaraswati, thus moves from &quot;mere meter; then melody and meter; continuing with music, meaning and meter; its expansion in the centerpiece of the varnam; thereafter, music and meaning without meter; (...) a non-metrical song at the end. We see a most wonderful completeness and symmetry in this art&quot;.

===Costume and attire===

The costume of a female Bharatanatyam dancer resembles a Tamil Hindu bridal dress. It typically consists of a sari in bright colors with golden or silver &quot;zari&quot; embroidery on the borders. The costume can be stitched from the &quot;sari&quot;, with individual pieces for a bottom (either a skirt or &quot;salwar&quot;-shaped pants), a pleated piece which falls in front and opens like a hand fan when the dancer flexes her knees or performs footwork, a hip piece that covers the seat of the pant/skirt, and a torso piece that looks like an &quot;aanchal&quot; (i.e. the draped part of a regular sari). Some dancers also opt for an unstitched &quot;sari&quot; that is draped specially, with the single piece of cloth starting around the legs like a &quot;dhoti&quot;, then upwards along the front torso, over the left shoulder, and then down the back with its end held at the waist by a jeweled belt. The costume of a male Bharatanatyam dancer is usually either a &quot;sari&quot; or a white cotton cloth draped around the legs and bottom half of the body like a &quot;dhoti&quot;. During performances, the upper body of the male dancer remains bare. Male dancers typically do not wear stitched costumes.

Both female and male dancers wear elaborate jewelry on their ears, nose, neck, and wrists. Female dancers wear additional jewelry on their heads that emphasizes their hairline and parting. They also wear a smaller piece of jewelry on each side of their parting. These represent the sun and the moon.

Long hair on both male and female dancers is either secured by a bun or a braid. Female dancers with short hair often use braid extensions or bun hair pieces to simulate long hair. Female dancers also wear imitation flowers made of either cloth or paper around their braids or buns. These are known as (or &quot;gajra&quot;).

Both male and female dancers wear makeup, including foundation, blush, lipstick, and thick eyeliner or kohl, which helps the audience see and understand their facial expressions.

All dancers wear leather anklets on each foot, which are called &quot;salangai&quot; or &quot;ghungroos&quot;. These are made of small bells attached to a broad leather strap with belts that secure them at the back of the ankle. The bells are arranged in uniform rows and can be heard when the dancer moves their feet. The &quot;salangai&quot; helps emphasize the rhythm of the music as well as the dancer&#x27;s footwork.

Lastly, all dancers outline their hands and feet with red &quot;kumkum&quot; powder or alta, a tradition that helps the audience easily see their hand and foot gestures.

For classes, training, practice, or rehearsals, dancers traditionally wear a special dance sari. These saris are always cotton and have a shorter breadth than normal saris, falling at the knees rather than the ankles. These are paired with cotton pyjamas and blouses. The sari is worn with pleats at the front and tied tightly around the torso and hips. However, in recent times, dancers also opt for salwar kameez or athletic wear (like T-shirts and leggings) when not performing. 

The accompanying music to Bharatanatyam is in the Carnatic style of South India, as is the recitation and chanting. The vocalist is called &quot;nattuvanar&quot;, typically also the conductor of the entire performance, who may be the guru of the dancer and may also be playing cymbals or one of the musical instruments. The recited verses and text in Bharatanatyam are in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Sanskrit.

The instruments used include the mridangam (double-sided drum), nadaswaram (long type of oboe made from black wood), nattuvangam (cymbals), the flute, violin and veena.

===Symbolism===

Bharatanatyam, like all classical dances of India, uses symbolism in its &quot;abhinaya&quot; (acting) and its goals. The roots of &quot;abhinaya&quot; appear in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; text, which defines drama in verse 6.10 as something that aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of the actor&#x27;s art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a sensual inner state of being. A performance art, asserts &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, connects the artists and the audience through &quot;abhinaya&quot; (literally, &quot;carrying to the spectators&quot;), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music. Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art that engages every aspect of life to glorify and give a state of joyful consciousness.

The communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures and pantomime set to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the &quot;ras&quot; (sentiment, emotional taste) and &quot;bhava&quot; (mood) of the underlying story. In the Hindu texts on dance, the dancer successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: &quot;Angika&quot; (gestures and body language), &quot;Vachika&quot; (song, recitation, music and rhythm), &quot;Aharya&quot; (stage setting, costume, makeup, jewelry), and &quot;Sattvika&quot; (artist&#x27;s mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist&#x27;s inner and outer state resonates). &quot;Abhinaya&quot; draws out the &quot;bhava&quot; (mood, psychological states).

The gestures used in Bharatanatyam are called &quot;Hasta&quot; (or &quot;mudras&quot;). These symbols are of three types: &quot;asamyuta hastas&quot; (single hand gestures), &quot;samyuta hastas&quot; (two hand gestures), and &quot;nrtta hastas&quot; (dance hand gestures). Like words in a glossary, these gestures are presented in the &quot;nritta&quot; as a list or embellishment to a prelim performance. In &quot;nritya&quot; stage of Bharatanatyam, these symbols set in a certain sequence become sentences with meaning, with emotions expressed through facial expressions and other aspects of &quot;abhinaya&quot;. The basic standing position is called as Aramandi.

Bharatanatyam contains at least 20 asanas found in modern yoga, including Dhanurasana (the bow, a back-arch); Chakrasana (the wheel, a standing back-arch); Vrikshasana (the tree, a standing pose); and Natarajasana, the pose of dancing Shiva. 108 karanas of classical temple dance are represented in temple statuary; they depict the devadasi temple dancers who made use of yoga asanas in their dancing. Bharatanatyam is also considered a form of Bhakti Yoga. However, Natarajasana is not found in any medieval hatha yoga text; it was among the many asanas introduced into modern yoga by Krishnamacharya in the early 20th century.

==Modern revival: schools and training centers==
Bharatanatyam rapidly expanded after India gained independence from British rule in 1947. It is now the most popular classical Indian dance style in India, enjoys a high degree of support in expatriate Indian communities, and is considered to be synonymous with Indian dance by many foreigners unaware of the diversity of dances and performance arts in Indian culture. In the second half of the 20th century, Bharatanatyam has been to Indian dance tradition what ballet has been in the West.

When the British government tried to attempt to ban Bharatanatyam traditions, it went on and revived by moving outside the Hindu temple and religious ideas. However, post-independence, with rising interest in its history, the ancient traditions, the invocation rituals and the spiritually expressive part of the dance has returned. Many innovations and developments in modern Bharatanatyam, states Anne-Marie Geston, are of a quasi-religious type. Major cities in India now have numerous schools that offer lessons in &quot;Bharatanatyam&quot;, and these cities host hundreds of shows every year.

Outside India, Bharatanatyam is a sought-after and studied dance, states Meduri, in academic institutes in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, the Gulf States, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, New Zealand, Bangladesh and Singapore. For expat Indian and Tamil communities in many countries, it is a source and means for social life and community bonding. Contemporary Bharatanatyam choreographies include both male and female dancers.

In 2020, an estimated 10,000 dancers got together in Chennai, India, to break the world record for the largest Bharatanatyam performance. The previous record of 7,190 dancers was set in Chidambaram in 2019.

<doc id="56502" wikidata="Q111098" url="?curid=56502" title="Rockland County, New York">
<text>Rockland County is the southernmost county on the west side of the Hudson River in the U.S. state of New York. It is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the county&#x27;s population is 338,329, making it the state&#x27;s third-most densely populated county outside New York City after Nassau and neighboring Westchester counties. The county seat and largest hamlet is New City. Rockland County is accessible via both the New York State Thruway, which crosses the Hudson River to Westchester via the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Tappan Zee, ten exits up from the NYC border; and the Palisades Parkway, four exits up, via the George Washington Bridge. The county&#x27;s name derives from &quot;rocky land&quot;, as the area has been aptly described, largely due to the Hudson River Palisades. The county is part of the Hudson Valley region of the state.

Rockland County is the smallest county by area in New York outside New York City. It comprises five towns, eighteen incorporated villages, eighteen census-designated places, eight hamlets and eleven defunct communities. Rockland County is designated as a Preserve America Community, and nearly a third of the county&#x27;s area is parkland. The county has the largest Jewish population percentage of any U.S. county, at 31.4%, or 90,000 residents. Rockland also ranked 80th on the list of highest-income counties by median household income in the United States, with a median household income of $82,534 according to the 2010 census.

==History==


The area that became Rockland County was originally inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Native Americans, including Munsees and Lenape. The Tappan tribe had a particularly noteworthy presence in the area, extending from present-day Nyack, south to Sparkill and Tappan, down the Hackensack River valley through present-day Bergen County, New Jersey, and also along the Palisades and Hudson River shore all the way to present-day Edgewater, New Jersey.

In 1609, Henry Hudson was the first major English explorer to arrive in the area. Hudson, thinking he had found the legendary &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;, sailed on the &quot;Half Moon&quot; up the river that would one day bear his name, and sailing through present-day Haverstraw before exploring north in present-day Albany.

In the years before 1664 when the area was formally a Dutch colony called New Netherland, present-day Rockland did not have formal European settlements. However, individuals did explore the area and made transactions with Tappan tribe for land with the idea that it could have future use. For example, in 1640, Dutch Captain David Pietersz. de Vries purchased from natives the area where the Sparkill Creek flows into the Hudson River.

In 1664, the British Crown assumed control of New Netherland from the Dutch. In June 1664, the Berkeley-Carteret land grant established the colony of New Jersey, dividing present-day Rockland and Bergen Counties into separate political areas. The northern border of New Jersey was placed in a straight line from the Delaware River at present-day Port Jervis to the Hudson River at 41 degrees even North latitude, where the Palisades Cliffs pause and give way to Sneden&#x27;s Landing in Orangetown. The state line remains there to this day, though various disagreements along the exact border were had over the years.

In the 1670s, permanent Dutch settlers began to arrive with land grants, starting with the Tappan area. These settlers were eager to escape &quot;city life&quot;, moving from Manhattan to Rockland. A number of unique, Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin.

In 1683, when the Duke of York (who became King James II of England) established the first 12 counties of New York, present-day Rockland County was part of Orange County, known then as &quot;Orange County South of the Mountains&quot;. Orangetown was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize Nyack and Tappan, the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.

The natural barrier of the Ramapo Mountains and the size of the county made carrying out governmental activities difficult. At one point, two governments were active, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains, so Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year, the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.

Haverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719, and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day Clarkstown, Ramapo, and Stony Point. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.

During the American Revolution, when control of the Hudson River was viewed by the British as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland saw skirmishes at Haverstraw, Nyack, and Piermont, and significant military engagements at the Battle of Stony Point, where General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne earned his nickname. George Washington had headquarters for a time at John Suffern&#x27;s tavern, the later site of the village of Suffern. British Major John André met with American traitor Benedict Arnold near Stony Point to buy the plans for the fortifications at West Point. André was captured with the plans in Tarrytown on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged, and buried nearby. Yet another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received Sir Guy Carleton at the DeWint House, where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later, Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel, H.M.S Perseverance, laying anchor in the Hudson. On this day, the king&#x27;s navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.

In the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and brick manufactories. Many buildings in New York City were built with bricks made in Rockland. These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the Hudson Highlands on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. Union Pacific Railroad president E. H. Harriman, though, donated land and large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of Bear Mountain. Bear Mountain/Harriman State Park became a reality in 1910 when Harriman&#x27;s widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914, more than an estimated one million people a year were coming to the park. After World War I, Rockland County became the most important sausage-making hub in New York.

In 1911, Letchworth Village, an institution for the mentally disabled opened in Rockland County near Thiells. The institution gained national infamy in 1972, when an investigation by Geraldo Rivera revealed the patients there to have been housed in neglectful conditions. Letchworth closed in 1996.

Rockland remained semi-rural until the 1950s, when the Palisades Interstate Parkway, Tappan Zee Bridge,New York State Thruway, and other major transit arteries were built. In the decades that followed, the county became a maturely developed suburb of New York City. As people moved up from the five boroughs (particularly the Bronx in the early years), the population flourished from 89,276 in 1950 to 338,329 in 2020.

==Geography==

Rockland County lies just north of the New Jersey-New York border, west of Westchester County (across the Hudson River), and south of Orange County. Its east border is formed by the Tappan Zee portion of the Hudson River. The county&#x27;s terrain ranges from ASL on Rockhouse Mountain (northwest of Lake Welch) to approaching sea level along the Hudson River. According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and 25.79 sqmi (66.80 km2) (13%) are covered by water. It is the state&#x27;s smallest county outside the five boroughs of New York City.

About 30% of Rockland County is devoted to parkland, belonging to either the five towns, incorporated villages, the state, or the county. These parks provide walking and hiking trails, ballfields, dog runs, historic sites, ponds, streams, salt marshes, and equestrian trails. Some popular state parks include Bear Mountain State Park on the northernmost tip of the county, Harriman State Park, also along the county&#x27;s northern boundary, and Nyack Beach State Park along the Hudson River, with trails connecting to Rockland Lake State Park. The county hosts numerous public and private golf courses, with the towns of Orangetown, Ramapo, Stony Point, and Haverstraw all operating public golf courses within their towns. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission operates two golf courses in Rockland Lake State Park. Notable private courses in the county include Paramount Country Club, Manhattan Woods Golf Course (designed by PGA great Gary Player), and Rockland Country Club (Sparkill).

===County courts===

There are three types of general trial courts in Rockland County: the New York Supreme Court, the County Court, and the Justice Courts. The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the New York State Unified Court System, which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest court of appeals in the federal system, as well as in most states (the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York). The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally, the Supreme Court in Rockland County hears civil cases involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over criminal cases in most counties, this is handled by the County Courts. In Rockland, however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.

The County Court is inferior to the Supreme Court and is authorized to hear criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles felony cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on misdemeanor cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court&#x27;s jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.

Each of the towns and 15 of the villages have Justice Courts, which mostly hear routine traffic ticket cases, especially from the New York State Thruway and the Palisades Interstate Parkway. They also handle drunk driving charges, lower-level criminal misdemeanor matters, and occasionally perform arraignment on felonies (most felony proceedings are heard in County Court). These courts generally handle the highest volume of cases.

===Law enforcement===
On March 1, 2024, Deirdre Smith was sworn in as the first female officer to serve as chief of detectives for Rockland County.

===National politics===
Like most of the Hudson Valley, Rockland County historically voted Republican but in recent years has leaned Democratic. Between 1892 and 1992, Rockland County was won only three times by Democrats in presidential elections – in Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s landslide victory in 1964, Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s landslide in 1936 (in which it was the only New York City suburb to vote Democratic), and Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s first campaign in 1912, when Republicans were fractured into two tickets. Rockland County began to lean Democratic in 1992 and has since voted Republican just twice, but elections have remained closer than in neighboring Westchester County, which has delivered dependable Democratic victories since the 1990s. Rockland County voted for Republicans George W. Bush in 2004 and Donald Trump in 2024, with Trump winning by the largest margin since 1988. As a result of St. Joseph County, Indiana and Caddo Parish, Louisiana voting Democratic in 2024, Rockland County is now the sole U.S. county-equivalent with the longest streak of voting for the winner of the popular vote in presidential elections, having done so in each one beginning in 1980.

According to Scorecard.org, which integrates data from different sources including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 2002, Rockland County ranked among the worst 10% in the United States in terms of air releases. Recent EPA statistics show that a total of 66 presently active Rockland County facilities are currently regulated. In Scorecard&#x27;s list of Top 10 polluters from 2002, the Lovett generating station in Tompkins Cove is the top polluter, releasing 1,523,339 pounds of toxic emissions. Studies were released in 2000 and in 2004 by the Clean Air Task Force to study the impacts of power plant emissions in the United States. This data for Rockland County shows that a total of $2,150,800 was paid in compensation for numerous illnesses caused by power plant pollution, including asthma attacks, heart attacks and death. The Lovett generating station was closed and dismantled prior to 2014. From 2015 to 2018, the Haverstraw Quarry owned and managed by CRH Tilcon and Oldcastle Materials was heavily fined for air and water pollution, including over-blasting, over-excavating, non-viable use of its NESCO unhealthy dust suppression systems and lethal dust &amp; water runoffs into protected waterways. In the period from 2017 to 2020, Suez experienced instances of discolored water and odor complaints. During 2020, the Rockland County Health Dept. and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) Conservationfound/investigated and informed Suez of untreated polluted water at Tilcon operated discharge points at a stream that flows into Lake DeForest. After discovery, Tilcon stopped pumping the waste.

==Solar field==
In 2014, Clarkstown created a first-of-its-kind in New York State 2.3-megawatt solar system consisting of about 4,300 panels on top of a closed, highly regulated, flat shadeless 13-acre section of the former garbage landfill in West Nyack. The unit is sized to generate 3 million kilowatt-hours annually – enough power to supply about 200 homes, that provides one-third of the electric needs of the Town of Clarkstown government. The Clarkstown solar field project is at the maximum size that is currently allowed by New York State. The installation was projected to save taxpayers as much as $4 million over 30 years by reducing the amount of the town&#x27;s annual electric bill – which is about $2 million and produce 10 percent of all the electricity that O&amp;R gets through solar power. The project was installed in summer 2014, coming online in October.

<text>The monarchy of Canada is Canada&#x27;s form of government embodied by the Canadian sovereign and head of state. It is one of the key components of Canadian sovereignty and sits at the core of Canada&#x27;s constitutional federal structure and Westminster-style parliamentary democracy. The monarchy is the foundation of the executive (King-in-Council), legislative (King-in-Parliament), and judicial (King-on-the-Bench) branches of both federal and provincial jurisdictions. The current monarch is King Charles III, who has reigned since 8 September 2022.

Although the sovereign is shared with 14 other independent countries within the Commonwealth of Nations, each country&#x27;s monarchy is separate and legally distinct. As a result, the current monarch is officially titled &quot;King of Canada&quot; and, in this capacity, he and other members of the royal family undertake public and private functions domestically and abroad as representatives of Canada. However, the monarch is the only member of the royal family with any constitutional role. The monarch lives in the United Kingdom and, while several powers are the sovereign&#x27;s alone, most of the royal governmental and ceremonial duties in Canada are carried out by the monarch&#x27;s representative, the governor general of Canada. In each of Canada&#x27;s provinces, the monarchy is represented by a lieutenant governor. As territories fall under the federal jurisdiction, they each have a commissioner, rather than a lieutenant governor, who represents the federal Crown-in-Council directly.

All executive authority is vested in the sovereign, so the monarch&#x27;s consent is necessary for letters patent and orders-in-council to have legal effect. As well, the monarch is part of the Parliament of Canada, so royal assent is required to allow for bills to become law. While the power for these acts stems from the Canadian people through the constitutional conventions of democracy, executive authority remains vested in the Crown and is only entrusted by the sovereign to the government on behalf of the people. This underlines the Crown&#x27;s role in safeguarding the rights, freedoms, and democratic system of government of Canadians, reinforcing the fact that &quot;governments are the servants of the people and not the reverse&quot;. Thus, within Canada&#x27;s constitutional monarchy the sovereign&#x27;s direct participation in any of these areas of governance is normally limited, with the sovereign typically exercising executive authority only with the advice and consent of the Cabinet of Canada, and the sovereign&#x27;s legislative and judicial responsibilities largely carried out through the Parliament of Canada as well as judges and justices of the peace. There are, though, cases where the sovereign or their representative would have a duty to act directly and independently under the doctrine of necessity to prevent genuinely unconstitutional acts. In these respects, the sovereign and his viceroys are custodians of the Crown&#x27;s reserve powers and represent the &quot;power of the people above government and political parties&quot;. Put another way, the Crown functions as the guarantor of Canada&#x27;s continuous and stable governance and as a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power.

Canada has been described as &quot;one of the oldest continuing monarchies in the world&quot; of today. Parts of what is now Canada have been under a monarchy since as early as the 15th century as a result of colonial settlement and often competing claims made on territory in the name of the English (and later British) and French crowns. Monarchical government has developed as the result of colonization by the French colonial empire and British Empire competing for territory in North America and a corresponding succession of French and British sovereigns reigning over New France and British America, respectively. As a result of the conquest of New France, claims by French monarchs were extinguished and what became British North America came under the hegemony of the British monarchy which ultimately evolved into the Canadian monarchy of today. With the exception of Newfoundland from 1649 to 1660, no part of what is now Canada has been a republic or part of a republic; though, there have been isolated calls for the country to become one. The Crown, however, is considered to be &quot;entrenched&quot; into the governmental framework. The institution that is Canada&#x27;s system of constitutional monarchy is sometimes colloquially referred to as the &quot;Maple Crown&quot; or &quot;Crown of Maples&quot;, Canada having developed a &quot;recognizably Canadian brand of monarchy&quot;.

Though not part of the Canadian monarchy, either past or present, Canada has an even older tradition of hereditary chieftainship in some First Nations, which has been likened to non-sovereign monarchy and today exists in parallel with the Canadian Crown and individual band governments. All three entities are components of the nation-to-nation relationship between the Crown and First Nations in upholding treaty rights and obligations developed over the centuries.

==International and domestic aspects==

The monarch is shared in a personal union with 14 other Commonwealth realms within the 56-member Commonwealth of Nations. As he resides in the United Kingdom, viceroys (the governor general of Canada in the federal sphere and a lieutenant governor in each province) represent the sovereign in Canada and are able to carry out most of the royal governmental duties, even when the monarch is in the country Nevertheless, the monarch can carry out Canadian constitutional and ceremonial duties abroad.

The evolution of the role of the governor general from being both a representative of the sovereign and an &quot;agent of the British government&quot; who &quot; in matters deemed to be of &#x27;imperial&#x27; concern... acted on the instructions of the British Colonial Office&quot; to being solely a representative of the monarch developed with a rise in Canadian nationalism following the end of the First World War culminating in the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. Since then, the Crown has had both a shared and a separate character: the sovereign&#x27;s role as monarch of Canada has been distinct from his or her position as monarch of any other realm, including the United Kingdom. Only Canadian federal ministers of the Crown may advise the sovereign on any and all matters of the Canadian state, of which the sovereign, when not in Canada, is kept abreast by weekly communications with the federal viceroy. The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution and, in Canada, became a Canadian, or &quot;domesticated&quot;, establishment, though it is still often denoted as &quot;British&quot; in both legal and common language, for reasons historical, political, and of convenience.

This division is illustrated in a number of ways: The sovereign, for example, holds a unique Canadian title and, when he and other members of the royal family are acting in public specifically as representatives of Canada, they use, where possible, Canadian symbols, including the country&#x27;s national flag, unique royal symbols, armed forces uniforms, and the like, as well as Canadian Forces aircraft or other Canadian-owned vehicles for travel. Once in Canadian airspace, or arrived at a Canadian event taking place abroad, the Canadian secretary to the King, officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and other Canadian officials will take over from whichever of their other realms&#x27; counterparts were previously escorting the King or other member of the royal family.

The sovereign similarly only draws from Canadian funds for support in the performance of his duties when in Canada or acting as King of Canada abroad; Canadians do not pay any money to the King or any other member of the royal family, either towards personal income or to support royal residences outside of Canada.

There are five aspects to the monarchy of Canada: constitutional (such as the use of the royal prerogative in summoning and dissolving parliament, granting royal assent), national (delivering the Speech from the Throne and the Royal Christmas Message, distributing honours, decorations, and medals, and partaking in Remembrance Day ceremonies), international (the monarch being head of state in other Commonwealth realms, and being the head of the Commonwealth), religious (the words &quot;by the grace of God&quot; in the monarch&#x27;s title, the &quot;Act of Settlement, 1701&quot;, requiring the sovereign to be Anglican, and the monarch encouraging people &quot;to tolerate, accept, and understand cultures, beliefs, and faiths different from our own&quot;), and the welfare and service monarchy (seen in members of the royal family founding charities and supporting others, fundraising for charity, and giving royal patronage to civil and military organizations).

===Succession and regency===

As in the other Commonwealth realms, the current heir apparent to the Canadian throne is William, Prince of Wales, who is followed in the line of succession by his eldest child, Prince George.

====Demise of the Crown and accession====

Upon the death of the monarch, there is an immediate and automatic succession by the late sovereign&#x27;s heir; hence the phrase, &quot;the King is dead. Long live the King&quot;. No confirmation or further ceremony is necessary. The federal cabinet and civil service follow the &quot;Manual of Official Procedure of the Government of Canada&quot; in carrying out various formalities around the transition.

By custom, the accession of a new monarch is publicly proclaimed by the governor general-in-council, who meet at Rideau Hall immediately upon the previous monarch&#x27;s death. Since the adoption of the Statute of Westminster it has been considered &quot;constitutionally inappropriate&quot; for Canada&#x27;s accession proclamations to be approved by a British order-in-council, as the monarch has, since then, assumed the Canadian throne according to Canadian law. For the accession of Charles III, the first since the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority in 1989, the Chief Herald read the royal proclamation aloud. If Parliament is in session, the Prime Minister will announce the demise of the Crown there and move for a joint address of sympathy and loyalty to the new monarch.
A period of mourning also follows, during which portraits of the recently deceased monarch are draped with black fabric and staff at government houses wear black armbands. The &quot;Manual of Official Procedure of the Government of Canada&quot; states the prime minister is responsible for convening Parliament, tabling a resolution of loyalty and condolence from Parliament to the new monarch, and arranging for the motion to be seconded by the leader of the official opposition. The prime minister will then move to adjourn Parliament. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation keeps a regularly updated plan for a &quot;broadcast of national importance&quot;, announcing the demise of a sovereign and covering the aftermath, during which all regular programming and advertising is cancelled and on-call commentators contribute to a 24-hour news mode. As funerals for Canada&#x27;s sovereigns, as well as for their consorts, take place in the United Kingdom, commemoration services are conducted by the federal and provincial governments across Canada. Such ceremonies may also be held for other recently deceased members of the royal family. The day of the sovereign&#x27;s funeral is likely to be a federal holiday.

The new monarch is crowned in the United Kingdom in an ancient ritual but one not necessary for a sovereign to reign. Under the federal &quot;Interpretation Act&quot;, officials who hold a federal office under the Crown are not affected by the death of the monarch, nor are they required to take the Oath of Allegiance again. In some provinces, though, those holding Crown offices must swear the Oath to the new sovereign. All references in federal legislation to previous monarchs, whether in the masculine (e.g. &quot;His Majesty&quot;) or feminine (e.g. &quot;The Queen&quot;), continue to mean the reigning sovereign of Canada, regardless of his or her gender. This is because, in common law, the Crown never dies. After an individual accedes to the throne, he or she usually continues to reign until death.

====Legal aspects of succession====
The relationship between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the rules of succession to their respective crowns requires the unanimous consent of all the realms. Succession is governed by statutes, such as the &quot;Bill of Rights, 1689&quot;, the &quot;Act of Settlement, 1701&quot;, and the &quot;Acts of Union, 1707&quot;.
King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 and any possible future descendants of his were excluded from the line of succession. The British government at the time, wishing for speed so as to avoid embarrassing debate in Dominion parliaments, suggested that the governments of the Dominions of the British Commonwealth—then Australia, New Zealand, the Irish Free State, the Union of South Africa, and Canada—regard whoever was monarch of the UK to automatically be monarch of their respective Dominion. As with the other Dominion governments, the Canadian Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, refused to accept the idea and stressed that the laws of succession were part of Canadian law and, as the Statute of Westminster 1931 disallowed the UK from legislating for Canada, including in relation to succession, altering them required Canada&#x27;s request and consent to the British legislation (&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936&quot;) becoming part of Canadian law. Sir Maurice Gwyer, first parliamentary counsel in the UK, reflected this position, stating the &quot;Act of Settlement&quot; was a part of the law in each Dominion. Thus, Order-in-Council P.C. 3144 was issued, expressing the Cabinet&#x27;s request and consent for &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936&quot;, to become part of the laws of Canada and the &quot;Succession to the Throne Act, 1937&quot;, gave parliamentary ratification to that action, together bringing the &quot;Act of Settlement&quot; and &quot;Royal Marriages Act, 1772&quot;, into Canadian law. The latter was deemed by the Cabinet in 1947 to be part of Canadian law. The Department of External Affairs included all succession-related laws in its list of acts within Canadian law.

The Supreme Court of Canada declared unanimously in the 1981 &quot;Patriation Reference&quot; that the &quot;Bill of Rights, 1689&quot;, is &quot;undoubtedly in force as part of the law of Canada&quot;. Furthermore, in &quot;O&#x27;Donohue v. Canada&quot; (2003) the Ontario Superior Court of Justice found that the &quot;Act of Settlement, 1701&quot;, is &quot;part of the laws of Canada&quot; and the rules of succession are &quot;by necessity incorporated into the Constitution of Canada&quot;. Another ruling of the Ontario Superior Court, in 2014, echoed the 2003 case, stating that the &quot;Act of Settlement&quot; &quot;is an imperial statute which ultimately became part of the law of Canada.&quot; Upon dismissing appeal of that case, the Court of Appeal of Ontario stated &quot;[t]he rules of succession are a part of the fabric of the constitution of Canada and incorporated into it&quot;.

In a meeting of the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution during the process of patriating the Canadian constitution in 1981, John Munro asked then-Minister of Justice Jean Chrétien about the &quot;selective omissions&quot; of the &quot;Succession to the Throne Act, 1937&quot;, the &quot;Demise of the Crown Act, 1901&quot;, the &quot;Seals Act&quot;, the &quot;Governor General&#x27;s Act&quot;, and the &quot;Royal Style and Titles Act, 1953&quot;, from the schedule to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. In response, Chrétien asserted that the schedule to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, was not exhaustive, outlining that section 52(2) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, says &quot;[t]he Constitution of Canada includes [...] the acts and orders referred to the schedule&quot; and &quot;[w]hen you use the word &#x27;includes&#x27; [...] it means that if ever there is another thing related to the Canadian constitution as part of it, should have been there, or might have been there, it is covered. So we do not have to renumerate [sic] the ones that you are mentioning.&quot; In the same meeting, Deputy Attorney General Barry Strayer stated: &quot;Clause 52(2) is not an exhaustive definition of the Constitution of Canada so that while we have certain things listed in the schedule which are clearly part of the constitution, that does not mean that there are not other things which are part of the constitution [...] [The schedule] is not an exhaustive list.&quot;

Leslie Zines claimed in the 1991 publication, &quot;Constitutional Change in the Commonwealth&quot;, that, though the succession to Canada&#x27;s throne was outlined by common law and the &quot;Act of Settlement, 1701&quot;, these were not part of the Canadian constitution, which &quot;does not contain rules for succession to the throne.&quot; Richard Toporoski, writing three years later for the Monarchist League of Canada, stated, &quot;there is no existing provision in our law, other than the &quot;Act of Settlement, 1701&quot;, that provides that the king or queen of Canada shall be the same person as the king or queen of the United Kingdom. If the British law were to be changed and we did not change our law [...] the person provided for in the new law would become king or queen in at least some realms of the Commonwealth; Canada would continue on with the person who would have become monarch under the previous law.&quot;

Canada, with the other Commonwealth realms, committed to the 2011 Perth Agreement, which proposed changes to the rules governing succession to remove male preference and removal of disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic. As a result, the Canadian Parliament passed the &quot;Succession to the Throne Act, 2013&quot;, which gave the country&#x27;s assent to the &quot;Succession to the Crown Bill&quot;, at that time proceeding in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. In dismissing a challenge to the law on the basis that a change to the succession in Canada would require unanimous consent of all provinces under section 41(a) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, Quebec Superior Court Justice Claude Bouchard ruled that Canada &quot;did not have to change its laws nor its constitution for the British royal succession rules to be amended and effective&quot; and constitutional convention committed Canada to having a line of succession symmetrical to those of other Commonwealth realms. The ruling was upheld by the Quebec Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear an appeal in April 2020.

Constitutional scholar Philippe Lagassé argues that, in light of the &quot;Succession to the Throne Act, 2013&quot;, and court rulings upholding that law, section 41(a) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, which requires a constitutional amendment passed with the unanimous consent of the provinces, applies only to the &quot;office of the Queen&quot;, but not who holds that office, and that therefore &quot;ending the principle of symmetry with the United Kingdom can be done with the general amending procedure, or even by Parliament alone under section 44 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.&quot;

Ted McWhinney, another constitutional scholar, argued that a then-future government of Canada could begin a process of phasing out the monarchy after the death of Elizabeth II &quot;quietly and without fanfare by simply failing legally to proclaim any successor to the Queen in relation to Canada&quot;. This would, he claimed, be a way of bypassing the need for a constitutional amendment that would require unanimous consent by the federal Parliament and all the provincial legislatures. However, Ian Holloway, Dean of Law at the University of Western Ontario, criticized McWhinney&#x27;s proposal for its ignorance of provincial input and opined that its implementation &quot;would be contrary to the plain purpose of those who framed our system of government.&quot;

Certain aspects of the succession rules have been challenged in the courts. For example, under the provisions of the &quot;Bill of Rights, 1689&quot;, and the &quot;Act of Settlement, 1701&quot;, Catholics are barred from succeeding to the throne; this prohibition has been upheld twice by Canadian courts, once in 2003 and again in 2014. Legal scholar Christopher Cornell of the SMU Dedman School of Law concluded &quot;that the prohibition on the Canadian Monarch being Catholic, while discriminatory, is perfectly-if not fundamentally-constitutional&quot; and that if the prohibition is &quot;to be changed or removed it will have to be accomplished politically and legislatively through another multilateral agreement similar to the Perth Agreement rather than judicially through the courts.&quot;

====Regency====
Canada has no laws allowing for a regency, should the sovereign be a minor or debilitated; none have been passed by the Canadian Parliament and it was made clear by successive cabinets since 1937 that the United Kingdom&#x27;s Regency Act had no applicability to Canada, as the Canadian Cabinet had not requested otherwise when the act was passed that year and again in 1943 and 1953. As the &quot;Letters Patent, 1947&quot;, issued by King George VI permit the governor general of Canada to exercise almost all of the monarch&#x27;s powers in respect of Canada, the viceroy is expected to continue to act as the personal representative of the monarch, and not any regent, even if the monarch is a child or incapacitated.
This has led to the question of whether the governor general has the ability to remove themselves and appoint their viceregal successor in the monarch&#x27;s name. While Lagassé argued that appears to be the case, both the &quot;Canadian Manual of Official Procedures&quot;, published in 1968, and the Privy Council Office took the opposite opinion. Lagassé and Patrick Baud claimed changes could be made to regulations to allow a governor general to appoint the next governor general; Christopher McCreery, however, criticised the theory, arguing it is impractical to suggest that a governor general would remove him or herself on ministerial advice, with the consequence that, if a prolonged regency occurred, it would remove one of the checks and balances in the constitution. The intent expressed whenever the matter of regency came up among Commonwealth realm heads of government was that the relevant parliament (other than the United Kingdom&#x27;s) would pass a bill if the need for a regency arose and the pertinent governor-general would already be empowered to grant royal assent to it. The governor general appointing their successor is not a power that has been utilized to date.

===Foreign visits===

The following state and official visits to foreign countries have been made by the monarch as the sovereign of Canada (sometimes representing other realms on the same visit):

==Federal and provincial aspects==

The origins of Canadian sovereignty lie in the early 17th century, during which time the monarch in England fought with parliament there over who had ultimate authority, culminating in the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the subsequent &quot;Bill of Rights, 1689&quot;, which, as mentioned elsewhere in this article, is today part of Canadian constitutional law. This brought to Canada the British notion of the supremacy of parliament—of which the monarch is a part—and it was carried into each of the provinces upon the implementation of responsible government. That, however, was superseded when the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; (within the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;) introduced into Canada the American idea of the supremacy of the law. Still, the King remains the sovereign of Canada.

Canada&#x27;s monarchy was established at Confederation, when its executive government and authority were declared, in section 9 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, to continue and be vested in the monarch. Placing such power, along with legislative power, with the tangible, living Queen, rather than the abstract and inanimate Crown, was a deliberate choice by the framers of the constitution. Still, the Crown is the foundation of the country as &quot;the very centre of [Canada&#x27;s] constitution and democracy.&quot; Although Canada is a federation, the Canadian monarchy is unitary throughout all jurisdictions in the country, the sovereignty of the different administrations being passed on through the overreaching Crown itself as a part of the executive, legislative, and judicial operations in each of the federal and provincial spheres and the headship of state being a part of all equally. The Crown thus links the various governments into a federal state, while it is simultaneously also &quot;divided&quot; into 11 legal jurisdictions, or 11 &quot;crowns&quot;—one federal and 10 provincial—with the monarch taking on a distinct legal persona in each. As such, the constitution instructs that any change to the position of the monarch or his or her representatives in Canada requires the consent of the Senate, the House of Commons, and the legislative assemblies of all the provinces. The Crown, being shared and balanced, provides the bedrock upon which all of Canada&#x27;s different regions and peoples can live together peacefully and was said by David E. Smith, in 2017, to be the &quot;keystone of the constitutional architecture&quot; of Canada.
The Crown is located beyond politics, existing to give authority to and protect the constitution and system of governance. Power, therefore, rests with an institution that &quot;functions to safeguard it on behalf of all its citizens&quot;, rather than any singular individual. The sovereign and his representatives typically &quot;act by &#x27;not acting&#x27;&quot;—holding power, but, not exercising it—both because they are unelected figures and to maintain their neutrality, &quot;deliberately, insistently, and resolutely&quot;, in case they have to be an impartial arbiter in a constitutional crisis and ensure that normal democratic discourse can resume. Consequently, the Crown performs two functions: as a unifying symbol and a protector of democratic rights and freedoms, &quot;tightly woven into the fabric of the Canadian constitution.&quot;

At the same time, a number of freedoms granted by the constitution to all other Canadians are denied to, or limited for, the monarch and the other senior members of the royal family: freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom to travel, freedom to choose a career, freedom to marry, and freedom of privacy and family life.

While the Crown is empowered by statute and the royal prerogative, it also enjoys inherent powers not granted by either. The Court of Appeal of British Columbia ruled in 1997 that &quot;the Crown has the capacities and powers of a natural person&quot; and its actions as a natural person are, as with the actions of any natural person, subject to judicial review. Further, it was determined in &quot;R. v Secretary of State for Health the ex parte C&quot; that, &quot;as a matter of capacity, no doubt, [the Crown] has power to do whatever a private person can do. But, as an organ of government, it can only exercise those powers for the public benefit, and for identifiably &#x27;governmental&#x27; purposes within limits set by the law.&quot; Similarly, use of the royal prerogative is justiciable, though, only when the &quot;subject matter affects the rights or legitimate expectations of an individual&quot;.

The governor general is appointed by the monarch on the advice of his federal prime minister and the lieutenant governors are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the federal prime minister. The commissioners of Canada&#x27;s territories are appointed by the federal governor-in-council, at the recommendation of the minister of Crown–Indigenous relations, but, as the territories are not sovereign entities, the commissioners are not personal representatives of the sovereign. The Advisory Committee on Vice-Regal Appointments, which may seek input from the relevant premier and provincial or territorial community, proposes candidates for appointment as governor general, lieutenant governor, and commissioner.

===Sovereign immunity===
It has been held since 1918 that the federal Crown is immune from provincial law. Constitutional convention has also held that the Crown in right of each province is outside the jurisdiction of the courts in other provinces. This view, however, has been questioned.

Lieutenant governors do not enjoy the same immunity as the sovereign in matters not relating to the powers of the viceregal office, as decided in the case of former Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Lise Thibault, who had been accused of misappropriating public funds.

==Personification of the Canadian state==
As the living embodiment of the Crown, the sovereign is regarded as the personification of the Canadian state and is meant to represent all Canadians, regardless of political affiliation. As such, he, along with his or her viceregal representatives, must &quot;remain strictly neutral in political terms&quot;.

The person of the reigning sovereign thus holds two distinct personas in constant coexistence, an ancient theory of the &quot;King&#x27;s two bodies&quot;—the body natural (subject to infirmity and death) and the body politic (which never dies). The Crown and the monarch are &quot;conceptually divisible but legally indivisible [...] The office cannot exist without the office-holder&quot;, so, even in private, the monarch is always &quot;on duty&quot;. The terms &quot;the state&quot;, &quot;the Crown&quot;, &quot;the Crown in Right of Canada&quot;, &quot;His Majesty the King in Right of Canada&quot; (), and similar are all synonymous and the monarch&#x27;s legal personality is sometimes referred to simply as &quot;Canada&quot;.

The monarch is at the apex of the Canadian order of precedence and, as the embodiment of the state, is also the focus of oaths of allegiance, required of many of the aforementioned employees of the Crown, as well as by new citizens, as by the Oath of Citizenship. Allegiance is given in reciprocation to the sovereign&#x27;s Coronation Oath, wherein he or she promises to govern the people of Canada &quot;according to their respective laws and customs&quot;.

===Head of state===
Although it has been argued that the term &quot;head of state&quot; is a republican one inapplicable in a constitutional monarchy such as Canada, where the monarch is the embodiment of the state and thus cannot be head of it, the sovereign is regarded by official government sources, judges, constitutional scholars, and pollsters as the head of state, while the governor general and lieutenant governors are all only representatives of, and thus equally subordinate to, that figure. Some governors general, their staff, government publications, and constitutional scholars like Ted McWhinney and C.E.S. Franks have, however, referred to the position of governor general as that of Canada&#x27;s head of state; though, sometimes qualifying the assertion with or &quot;effective&quot;; Franks has hence recommended that the governor general be named officially as the head of state. Still others view the role of head of state as being shared by both the sovereign and his viceroys. Since 1927, governors general have been received on state visits abroad as though they were heads of state.
Officials at Rideau Hall have attempted to use the &quot;Letters Patent, 1947&quot;, as justification for describing the governor general as head of state. However, the document makes no such distinction, nor does it effect an abdication of the sovereign&#x27;s powers in favour of the viceroy, as it only allows the governor general to &quot;act on the Queen&#x27;s behalf&quot;. D. Michael Jackson, former Chief of Protocol of Saskatchewan, argued that Rideau Hall had been attempting to &quot;recast&quot; the governor general as head of state since the 1970s and doing so preempted both the Queen and all of the lieutenant governors. This caused not only &quot;precedence wars&quot; at provincial events (where the governor general usurped the lieutenant governor&#x27;s proper spot as most senior official in attendance) and Governor General Adrienne Clarkson to accord herself precedence before the Queen at a national occasion, but also constitutional issues by &quot;unbalancing [...] the federalist symmetry&quot;. This has been regarded as both a natural evolution and as a dishonest effort to alter the constitution without public scrutiny.

In a poll conducted by Ipsos-Reid following the first prorogation of the 40th parliament on 4 December 2008, it was found that 42 per cent of the sample group thought the prime minister was head of state, while 33 per cent felt it was the governor general. Only 24 per cent named the Queen as head of state, a number up from 2002, when the results of an EKOS Research Associates survey showed only 5 per cent of those polled knew the Queen was head of state (69 per cent answered that it was the prime minister).

===Arms===

The Arms of His Majesty the King in Right of Canada is the arms of dominion of the Canadian monarch and, thus, equally the official coat of arms of Canada and a symbol of national sovereignty. It is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version, which was employed in Canada before the granting of the Canadian arms in 1921.

The royal standard is the monarch&#x27;s official flag, which depicts the royal arms in banner form. It takes precedence above all other flags in Canada—including the national flag and those of the other members of the royal family—and is typically flown from buildings, vessels, and vehicles in which the sovereign is present (although exceptions have been made for its use when the monarch is not in attendance). The royal standard is never flown at half-mast because there is always a sovereign: when one dies, his or her successor becomes the sovereign instantly. Elements of the royal arms have also been incorporated into the governor general&#x27;s flag; similarly, the flags of the lieutenant governors employ the shields of the relevant provincial coat of arms.

==Federal constitutional role==
Canada&#x27;s constitution is based on the Westminster parliamentary model, wherein the role of the King is both legal and practical, but not political. The sovereign is vested with all the powers of state, collectively known as the royal prerogative, leading the populace to be considered subjects of the Crown. However, as the sovereign&#x27;s power stems from the people and the monarch is a constitutional one, he or she does not rule alone, as in an absolute monarchy. Instead, the Crown is regarded as a corporation sole, with the monarch being the centre of a construct in which the power of the whole is shared by multiple institutions of government—the executive, legislative, and judicial—acting under the sovereign&#x27;s authority, which is entrusted for exercise by the politicians (the elected and appointed parliamentarians and the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from among them) and the judges and justices of the peace. The monarchy has thus been described as the underlying principle of Canada&#x27;s institutional unity and the monarch as a &quot;guardian of constitutional freedoms&quot; whose &quot;job is to ensure that the political process remains intact and is allowed to function.&quot;
The Great Seal of Canada &quot;signifies the power and authority of the Crown flowing from the sovereign to [the] parliamentary government&quot; and is applied to state documents such as royal proclamations and letters patent commissioning Cabinet ministers, senators, judges, and other senior government officials. The &quot;lending&quot; of royal authority to Cabinet is illustrated by the great seal being entrusted by the governor general, the official keeper of the seal, to the minister of innovation, science, and economic development, who is &quot;ex officio&quot; the registrar general of Canada. Upon a change of government, the seal is temporarily returned to the governor general and then &quot;lent&quot; to the next incoming registrar general.

The Crown is the pinnacle of the Canadian Armed Forces, with the constitution placing the monarch in the position of commander-in-chief of the entire force, though the governor general carries out the duties attached to the position and also bears the title of &quot;Commander-in-Chief in and over Canada&quot;.

===Executive (King-in-Council)===

The government of Canada—formally termed &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot;—is defined by the constitution as the King acting on the advice of his Privy Council; what is technically known as the &quot;King-in-Council&quot;, or sometimes the &quot;Governor-in-Council&quot;, referring to the governor general as the King&#x27;s stand-in, though, a few tasks must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent from, the King. One of the main duties of the Crown is to &quot;ensure that a democratically elected government is always in place,&quot; which means appointing a prime minister to thereafter head the Cabinet—a committee of the Privy Council charged with advising the Crown on the exercise of the royal prerogative. The monarch is informed by his viceroy of the swearing-in and resignation of prime ministers and other members of the ministry, remains fully briefed through regular communications from his Canadian ministers, and holds audience with them whenever possible. By convention, the content of these communications and meetings remains confidential so as to protect the impartiality of the monarch and his representative. The appropriateness and viability of this tradition in an age of social media has been questioned.

In the construct of constitutional monarchy and responsible government, the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding, meaning the monarch &quot;reigns&quot; but does not &quot;rule&quot;, the Cabinet ruling &quot;in trust&quot; for the monarch. This has been the case in Canada since the Treaty of Paris ended the reign of the territory&#x27;s last absolute monarch, King Louis XV of France. However, the royal prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of the ministers and the royal and viceroyal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations (an exercise of the reserve powers), thereby allowing the monarch to make sure &quot;the government conducts itself in compliance with the constitution&quot;; he and the viceroys being guarantors of the government&#x27;s constitutional, as opposed to democratic, legitimacy and must ensure the continuity of such. Use of the royal prerogative in this manner was seen when the Governor General refused his prime minister&#x27;s advice to dissolve Parliament in 1926 and when, in 2008, the Governor General took some hours to decide whether or not to accept her Prime Minister&#x27;s advice to prorogue Parliament to avoid a vote of non-confidence. The prerogative powers have also been used numerous times in the provinces.

The royal prerogative further extends to foreign affairs, including the ratification of treaties, alliances, international agreements, and declarations of war, the accreditation of Canadian high commissioners and ambassadors and receipt of similar diplomats from foreign states, and the issuance of Canadian passports, which remain the sovereign&#x27;s property. It also includes the creation of dynastic and national honours, though only the latter are established on official ministerial advice.

===Parliament (King-in-Parliament)===
All laws in Canada are the monarch&#x27;s and the sovereign is one of the three components of the Parliament of Canada—formally called the &quot;King-in-Parliament&quot;—but, the monarch and viceroy do not participate in the legislative process, save for royal consent, typically expressed by a minister of the Crown, and royal assent, which is necessary for a bill to be enacted as law. Either figure or a delegate may perform this task and the constitution allows the viceroy the option of deferring assent to the sovereign.

The governor general is further responsible for summoning the House of Commons, while either the viceroy or monarch can prorogue and dissolve the legislature, after which the governor general usually calls for a general election. This element of the royal prerogative is unaffected by legislation &quot;fixing&quot; election dates, as &quot;An Act to Amend the Canada Elections Act&quot; specifies that it does not curtail the Crown&#x27;s powers. The new parliamentary session is marked by either the monarch, governor general, or some other representative reading the Speech from the Throne. Members of Parliament must recite the Oath of Allegiance before they may take their seat. Further, the official opposition is traditionally dubbed as &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot;, illustrating that, while its members are opposed to the incumbent government, they remain loyal to the sovereign (as personification of the state and its authority).

The monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes without the authorization of an act of Parliament. The consent of the Crown must, however, be obtained before either of the houses of Parliament may even debate a bill affecting the sovereign&#x27;s prerogatives or interests and no act of Parliament binds the King or his rights unless the act states that it does.

===Courts (King-on-the-Bench)===

The sovereign is responsible for rendering justice for all his subjects and is thus traditionally deemed the &quot;fount of justice&quot; and his position in the Canadian courts formally dubbed the &quot;King on the Bench&quot;. The Arms of His Majesty in Right of Canada are traditionally displayed in Canadian courtrooms, as is a portrait of the sovereign. The badge of the Supreme Court also bears a St. Edward&#x27;s Crown to symbolize the source of the court&#x27;s authority.

The monarch does not personally rule in judicial cases; this function of the royal prerogative is instead performed in trust and in the King&#x27;s name by officers of His Majesty&#x27;s court. Common law holds the notion that the sovereign &quot;can do no wrong&quot;: the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his own courts—judged by himself—for criminal offences under his own laws. Canada inherited the common law version of Crown immunity from British law. However, over time, the scope of said immunity has been steadily reduced by statute law. With the passage of relevant legislation through the provincial and federal parliaments, the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the King-in-Council), in all areas of Canada, is now liable in tort, as any normal person would be. In international cases, as a sovereign and under established principles of international law, the King of Canada is not subject to suit in foreign courts without his express consent.

Within the royal prerogative is also the granting of immunity from prosecution, mercy, and pardoning offences against the Crown. Since 1878, the prerogative of pardon has always been exercised upon the recommendation of ministers.

===The Crown and Indigenous peoples===

Included in Canada&#x27;s constitution are the various treaties between the Crown and Canada&#x27;s First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples, who, like the Māori and the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand, generally view the affiliation as being not between them and the ever-changing Cabinet, but instead with the continuous Crown of Canada, as embodied in the reigning sovereign, meaning the link between monarch and Indigenous peoples in Canada will theoretically last for &quot;as long as the sun shines, grass grows, and rivers flow.&quot;

The association stretches back to the first decisions between North American Indigenous peoples and European colonialists and, over centuries of interface, treaties were established concerning the monarch and indigenous nations. The only treaties that survived the American Revolution are those in Canada, which date to the beginning of the 18th century. Today, the main guide for relations between the monarchy and Canadian First Nations is King George III&#x27;s &quot;Royal Proclamation of 1763&quot;; while not a treaty, it is regarded by First Nations as their Magna Carta or &quot;Indian bill of rights&quot;, as it affirmed native title to their lands and made clear that, though under the sovereignty of the Crown, the aboriginal bands were autonomous political units in a &quot;nation-to-nation&quot; association with non-native governments, with the monarch as the intermediary. The agreements with the Crown are administered by aboriginal law and overseen by the minister of Crown-Indigenous relations.

The link between the Crown and Indigenous peoples will sometimes be symbolically expressed through ceremony. Gifts have been frequently exchanged and aboriginal titles have been bestowed upon royal and viceregal figures since the early days of indigenous contact with the Crown. As far back as 1710, Indigenous leaders have met to discuss treaty business with royal family members or viceroys in private audience and many continue to use their connection to the Crown to further their political aims; public ceremonies attended by the monarch or another member of the royal family have been employed as a platform on which to present complaints, witnessed by both national and international cameras. Following country-wide protests, beginning in 2012, and the close of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015, focus turned toward rapprochement between the nations in the nation-to-nation relationship.

====Hereditary chiefs====


The hereditary chiefs are leaders within First Nations who represent different houses or clans and whose chieftaincies are passed down intergenerationally; most First Nations have a hereditary system. The positions are rooted in traditional models of Indigenous governance that predate the colonization of Canada and are organized in a fashion similar to the occidental idea of monarchy. Indeed, early European explorers often considered territories belonging to different aboriginal groups to be kingdoms—such as along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River, between the Trinity River and the Isle-aux-Coudres, and the neighbouring &quot;kingdom of Canada&quot;, which stretched west to the Island of Montreal—and the leaders of these communities were referred to as kings, particularly those chosen through heredity.

Today, the hereditary chiefs are not sovereign; according to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Crown holds sovereignty over the whole of Canada, including reservation and traditional lands. However, by some interpretations of case law from the same court, the chiefs have jurisdiction over traditional territories that fall outside of band-controlled reservation land, beyond the elected band councils established by the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. Although recognized by, and accountable to, the federal Crown-in-Council (the Government of Canada), band chiefs do not hold the cultural authority of hereditary chiefs, who often serve as knowledge-keepers, responsible for the upholding of a First Nation&#x27;s traditional customs, legal systems, and cultural practices. When serving as Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, Judith Guichon postulated that the role of hereditary chiefs mirrored that of Canada&#x27;s constitutional monarch, being the representative of &quot;sober second thought and wisdom, not the next political cycle; but, rather, enduring truths and the evolution of our nation through generations.&quot; For these reasons, the Crown maintains formal relations with Canada&#x27;s hereditary chiefs, including on matters relating to treaty rights and obligations.

==Cultural role==
===Royal presence and duties===

Members of the royal family have been present in Canada since the late 18th century, their reasons including participating in military manoeuvres, serving as the federal viceroy, or undertaking official royal tours, which &quot;reinforce [the] country&#x27;s collective heritage&quot;. At least one royal tour has been conducted every year between 1957 and 2018.

The &quot;welfare and service&quot; function of the monarchy is regarded as an important part of the modern monarchy&#x27;s role and demonstrates a significant change to the institution in recent generations, from a heavily ceremonialized, imperial crown to a &quot;more demotic and visible&quot; head of state &quot;interacting with the general population far beyond confined court circles.&quot; As such, a prominent feature of tours are royal walkabouts; a tradition initiated in 1939 by Queen Elizabeth when she was in Ottawa and broke from the royal party to speak directly to gathered veterans. Usually important milestones, anniversaries, or celebrations of Canadian culture will warrant the presence of the monarch, while other members of the royal family will be asked to participate in lesser occasions. A household to assist and tend to the monarch forms part of the royal party.

Official duties involve the sovereign representing the Canadian state at home or abroad, or her relations as members of the royal family participating in government organized ceremonies either in Canada or elsewhere; sometimes these individuals are employed in asserting Canada&#x27;s sovereignty over its territories. The advice of the Canadian Cabinet is the impetus for royal participation in any Canadian event, though, at present, the Chief of Protocol and his staff in the Department of Canadian Heritage are, as part of the State Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Program, responsible for orchestrating any official events in or for Canada that involve the royal family.
Conversely, unofficial duties are performed by royal family members for Canadian organizations of which they may be patrons, through their attendance at charity events, visiting with members of the Canadian Forces as colonel-in-chief, or marking certain key anniversaries. The invitation and expenses associated with these undertakings are usually borne by the associated organization. In 2005, members of the royal family were present at a total of 76 Canadian engagements, as well as several more through 2006 and 2007. In the period between 2019 and 2022, they carried out 53 engagements, the number reduced, and all through the latter year and a half being virtual, because of restrictions in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The various viceroys took part in 4,023 engagements through 2019 and 2020, both in-person and virtually.

Apart from Canada, the King and other members of the royal family regularly perform public duties in the other 14 Commonwealth realms in which the King is head of state. This situation, however, can mean the monarch and/or members of the royal family will be promoting one nation and not another; a situation that has been met with criticism.

===Symbols, associations, and awards===
The main symbol of the monarchy is the sovereign himself, described as &quot;the personal expression of the Crown in Canada,&quot; and his image is thus used to signify Canadian sovereignty and government authority—his image, for instance, appearing on currency, and his portrait in government buildings. The sovereign is further both mentioned in and the subject of songs, loyal toasts, and salutes. A royal cypher, appearing on buildings and official seals, or a crown, seen on provincial and national coats of arms, as well as police force and Canadian Forces regimental and maritime badges and rank insignia, is also used to illustrate the monarchy as the locus of authority, the latter without referring to any specific monarch.
Since the days of King Louis XIV, the monarch is the fount of all honours in Canada and the orders, decorations, and medals form &quot;an integral element of the Crown.&quot; Hence, the insignia and medallions for these awards bear a crown, cypher, and/or portrait of the monarch. Similarly, the country&#x27;s heraldic authority was created by Queen Elizabeth II and, operating under the authority of the governor general, grants new coats of arms, flags, and badges in Canada. Use of the royal crown in such symbols is a gift from the monarch showing royal support and/or association and requires his approval before being added.

Members of the royal family also act as ceremonial colonels-in-chief, commodores-in-chief, captains-general, air commodores-in-chief, generals, and admirals of various elements of the Canadian Forces, reflecting the Crown&#x27;s relationship with the country&#x27;s military through participation in events both at home and abroad. The monarch also serves as the Commissioner-in-Chief, and Prince Edward and Princess Anne as Honorary Deputy Commissioners, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

A number of Canadian civilian organizations have association with the monarchy, either through their being founded via a royal charter, having been granted the right to use the prefix &quot;royal&quot; before their name, or because at least one member of the royal family serves as a patron. In addition to The Prince&#x27;s Trust Canada, established by Charles III when Prince of Wales, some other charities and volunteer organizations have also been founded as gifts to, or in honour of, some of Canada&#x27;s monarchs or members of the royal family, such as the Victorian Order of Nurses, a gift to Queen Victoria for her Diamond Jubilee in 1897; the Canadian Cancer Fund, set up in honour of King George V&#x27;s Silver Jubilee in 1935; and the Queen Elizabeth II Fund to Aid in Research on the Diseases of Children. A number of awards in Canada are likewise issued in the name of previous or present members of the royal family. Further, organizations will give commemorative gifts to members of the royal family to mark a visit or other important occasion. All Canadian coins bear the image of the monarch reigning at the time of the coin&#x27;s production, with an inscription, (often abbreviated to ), a Latin phrase translated to English as, &quot;by the grace of God, king&quot;. During the reign of a female monarch, is replaced with , which is Latin for &#x27;queen&#x27;.

Throughout the 1970s, symbols of the monarch and monarchy were slowly removed from the public eye. For instance, the Queen&#x27;s portrait was seen less in public schools and the Royal Mail became Canada Post. Smith attributed this to the attitude the government of the day held toward Canada&#x27;s past; though, it never raised the policy in public or during any of the constitutional conferences held that decade. Andrew Heard argued, however, that dispensing with such symbols was necessary to facilitate the simultaneous increasing embrace of the monarch as Queen of Canada. Emblems such as the Royal Coat of Arms remained, however, and others, such as the monarch&#x27;s royal standard, were created. With the later developments of the governor general&#x27;s flag, foundation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, royal standards for other members of the royal family, and the like, Canada, along with New Zealand, is one of the two realms that have &quot;paid the greatest attention to the nationalization of the visual symbols of the monarchy.&quot;

===Significance to Canadian identity===

In his 2018 book, &quot;The Canadian Kingdom: 150 Years of Constitutional Monarchy&quot;, Jackson wrote that &quot;the Canadian manifestation of the monarchy is not only historical and constitutional, it is political, cultural, and social, reflecting, and contributing to, change and evolution in Canada&#x27;s governance, autonomy, and identity.&quot; Since at least the 1930s, supporters of the Crown have held the opinion that the monarch is a unifying focal point for the nation&#x27;s &quot;historic consciousness&quot;—the country&#x27;s heritage being &quot;unquestionably linked with the history of monarchy&quot;—and Canadian patriotism, traditions, and shared values, &quot;around which coheres the nation&#x27;s sense of a continuing personality&quot;. This infusion of monarchy into Canadian governance and society helps strengthen Canadian identity and distinguish it from American identity, a difference that has existed since at least 1864, when it was a factor in the Fathers of Confederation choosing to keep constitutional monarchy for the new country in 1866. Former Governor General Vincent Massey articulated in 1967 that the monarchy &quot;stands for qualities and institutions which mean Canada to every one of us and which, for all our differences and all our variety, have kept Canada Canadian.&quot;
But, Canadians were, through the late 1960s to the 2000s, encouraged by federal and provincial governments to &quot;neglect, ignore, forget, reject, debase, suppress, even hate, and certainly treat as foreign what their parents and grandparents, whether spiritual or blood, regarded as the basis of Canadian nationhood, autonomy, and history&quot;, including the monarchy. resulting in a disconnect between the Canadian populace and their monarch. Former Governor General Roland Michener said in 1970 that anti-monarchists claimed the Canadian Crown is foreign and incompatible with Canada&#x27;s multicultural society, which the government promoted as a Canadian identifier, and Lawrence Martin called in 2007 for Canada to become a republic in order to &quot;re-brand the nation&quot;. However, Michener also stated, &quot;[the monarchy] is our own by inheritance and choice, and contributes much to our distinctive Canadian identity and our chances of independent survival amongst the republics of North and South America.&quot; Journalist Christina Blizzard emphasized in 2009 that the monarchy &quot;made [Canada] a haven of peace and justice for immigrants from around the world&quot;, while Michael Valpy contended in 2009 that the Crown&#x27;s nature permitted non-conformity amongst its subjects, thereby opening the door to multiculturalism and pluralism. Johnston described the Crown as providing &quot;space for our values and beliefs as Canadians.&quot;

===In media and popular culture===
====Painting and sculpture====
Aside from official artworks, such as monuments and portraits commissioned by government bodies, Canadian painters have, by their own volition or for private organizations, created more expressive, informal depictions of Canada&#x27;s monarchs and other members of the royal family, ranging from fine art to irreverent graffiti. For example, the English-Canadian artist Frederic Marlett Bell-Smith produced &quot;The Artist Painting Queen Victoria&quot; in 1895, which now resides at the National Gallery of Canada. At Library and Archives Canada is the painting &quot;The Unveiling of the National War Memorial&quot;, capturing the dedication of the monument, in Ottawa, by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1939; though, the artist is unknown.
Hilton Hassell depicted Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) square dancing at Rideau Hall in 1951 and a portrait of Elizabeth II by Lorena Ziraldo, of Ottawa, was featured in the &quot;Hill Times&quot; and &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;.

Charles Pachter, from Toronto, fashioned the painting &quot;Noblesse Oblige&quot; in 1972, which shows Queen Elizabeth II, in her Guards Regiment uniform and saluting, as she did during Trooping the Colour ceremonies, except atop a moose instead of her horse, Burmese. Despite great controversy when it was first exhibited, it &quot;has become a Canadian cultural image; the people&#x27;s image&quot;. Pachter, subsequently made numerous variations on the theme, including &quot;Queen &amp; Moose&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Queen on a Moose&quot; (1988). The artist said, &quot;there was an amazing symmetry of putting the sovereign of her northern realm (Canada) on an animal who is the &#x27;monarch of the north, awkward but majestic. Pachter made similar pieces showing Elizabeth&#x27;s son, Prince Charles (now King Charles III) and his wife, Camilla, standing alongside a moose and Charles&#x27;s son, Prince William, and his wife, Catherine, with Canadian wildlife, such as a moose and a squirrel. For Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, Pachter created a series of fake postage stamps using all his paintings that include members of the royal family, which he called &quot;my branded images
for Canada.&quot; Some were featured on accessory items sold at the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

Portraits of Elizabeth II hung in several hockey arenas across Canada after her accession in 1952. One was in place in Maple Leaf Gardens until the early 1970s, when owner Harold Ballard had it removed to construct more seating, stating, &quot;if people want to see pictures of the Queen, they can go to an art gallery.&quot; Three large portraits of Elizabeth II were created for Winnipeg Arena, on display there from the building&#x27;s opening in 1955 to 1999.

At the time of the sesquicentennial of Confederation in 2017, Vancouver Island-based artist Timothy Hoey created a &quot;Canada 150&quot; version of his decade-long &quot;O Canada&quot; project, painting 150 Canadian icons in acrylic paint on 20.3 by 25.4 centimetre (eight by 10 inch) boards. Among them are numerous depictions of Queen Elizabeth II with other Canadian icons, such as beavers, Cheezies, the Grey Cup, the Stanley Cup, a bottle of beer (&quot;O Canada Liz Enjoying Some Wobbly-Pops&quot;), Rush (&quot;O Canada Closer to the Heart&quot;), the Hudson&#x27;s Bay point blanket, the Trans-Canada Highway, a birch canoe, a buckskin jacket, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police uniform, a Montreal Canadiens hockey sweater, and so on. Hoey had previously painted Elizabeth, in formal attire and tiara, holding a hockey stick in front of a Hudson&#x27;s Bay point blanket; the work titled &quot;O-Canada Liz&quot;. In 2021, he depicted the Queen in a decorative hat, uniform of the Vancouver Canucks from the 1978–1979 season, and full goaltender equipment.

The also exist wax sculptures of Queen Elizabeth II in private museums, such as the Royal London Wax Museum in Victoria, British Columbia, and the Wax Museum of History in Niagara Falls, Ontario.

====Television====
The television series &quot;Rideau Hall&quot;, starring Bette MacDonald, was produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and aired for one season in 2002. Its premise was a brash, one-hit wonder disco artist being appointed governor general on the advice of a republican prime minister.
Canadian comedian Scott Thompson regularly played a parody of Queen Elizabeth II in a Canadian context on the sketch comedy television show &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, as well as in other productions, such as &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Toast: A Royal Wedding Special&quot; and &quot;Conan&quot;. Thompson also voiced a portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in Canada in the animated television show &quot;Fugget About It&quot;, in the episode &quot;Royally Screwed&quot;.

The Canadian monarchy was parodied in &quot;Royal Pudding&quot;, the third episode of the 15th season of the animated television show &quot;South Park&quot;, which first aired on 11 May 2011. The opening focuses on a spoof of the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, featuring caricatures of Queen Elizabeth II; Prince William, Prince of Wales; and Catherine, Princess of Wales. Specific mention is made of &quot;the Queen of Canada&quot; and &quot;the Canadian royal family&quot;. The show subsequently, in the second episode of the 26th season, &quot;The Worldwide Privacy Tour&quot;, parodied the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as a prince of Canada and &quot;the wife&quot;, who, after hostile treatment at the funeral of the late Queen of Canada, go on national television and a world tour demanding people and the media not pay attention to them and branding themselves as victims.

==Royal family and house==

The Canadian royal family is the group of people who are comparatively closely related to the country&#x27;s monarch and, as such, belong to the House of Windsor and owe their allegiance specifically to the reigning king or queen of Canada. There is no legal definition of who is or is not a member of the royal family; though, the Government of Canada&#x27;s website lists &quot;working members of the royal family&quot;.

Unlike in the United Kingdom, the monarch is the only member of the royal family with a title established through Canadian law and is styled by convention as &quot;His/Her Majesty&quot;, as would be a queen consort. Otherwise, the remaining family members are, as a courtesy, styled and titled as they are in the UK, according to letters patent issued there, with additional French translations.

Those in the royal family are distant relations of the Belgian, Danish, Greek, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish royal families and, given the shared nature of the Canadian monarch, are also members of the British royal family. While Canadian and foreign media often refer to them as the &quot;British royal family&quot;, the Canadian government considers it inappropriate, as they are family members of the Canadian monarch. Further, in addition to the few Canadian citizens in the royal family, the sovereign is considered Canadian, and those among his relations who do not meet the requirements of Canadian citizenship law are considered Canadian, which entitles them to Canadian consular assistance and the protection of the King&#x27;s armed forces of Canada when they are in need of protection or aid outside of the Commonwealth realms, as well as, since 2013, substantive appointment to the Order of Canada and Order of Military Merit. Beyond formalities, members of the royal family have, on occasion, been said by the media and non-governmental organizations to be Canadian, have declared themselves to be Canadian, and some past members have lived in Canada for extended periods as viceroy or for other reasons.
According to the Canadian Royal Heritage Trust, Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn—due to his having lived in Canada between 1791 and 1800 and fathering Queen Victoria—is the &quot;ancestor of the modern Canadian royal family&quot;. Nonetheless, the concept of the Canadian royal family did not emerge until after the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, when Canadian officials only began to overtly consider putting the principles of Canada&#x27;s new status as an independent kingdom into effect. Initially, the monarch was the only member of the royal family to carry out public ceremonial duties solely on the advice of Canadian ministers; King Edward VIII became the first to do so when in July 1936 he dedicated the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France. Over the decades, however, the monarch&#x27;s children, grandchildren, cousins, and their respective spouses began to also perform functions at the direction of the Canadian Crown-in-Council, representing the monarch within Canada or abroad, in a role specifically as members of the Canadian royal family.

However, it was not until October 2002 when the term &quot;Canadian royal family&quot; was first used publicly and officially by one of its members: in a speech to the Nunavut legislature at its opening, Queen Elizabeth II stated: &quot;I am proud to be the first member of the Canadian royal family to be greeted in Canada&#x27;s newest territory.&quot; Princess Anne used it again when speaking at Rideau Hall in 2014, as did the now King Charles in Halifax the same year. Also in 2014, then-Premier of Saskatchewan Brad Wall called Prince Edward a member of the Canadian royal family. By 2011, both Canadian and British media were referring to &quot;Canada&#x27;s royal family&quot; or the &quot;Canadian royal family&quot;.

While Heard observed in 2018 that no direct legal action has, so far, created a Canadian royal family, he also asserted that the Canadian Heraldic Authority creating uniquely Canadian standards for members of the royal family other than the monarch was a symbolic &quot;localization of the royal family&quot;; Sean Palmer agreed, stating the banners are a sign the country has taken &quot;&#x27;ownership&#x27; not only of the Queen of Canada, but of the other members of her family as well&quot; and that doing so was another formal affirmation of the concept of a Canadian royal family &quot;as distinct as the Queen of Canada is from the Queen of the United Kingdom&quot;. Jai Patel and Sally Raudon also noted, in 2019, that the purpose of these heraldic banners was to recognize the owners&#x27; roles as members of the Canadian royal family.

==Federal residences and royal household==

Buildings across Canada reserved by the Crown for the use of the monarch and his viceroys are called &quot;Government House&quot;, but may be customarily known by some specific name. The sovereign&#x27;s and governor general&#x27;s official residences are Rideau Hall in Ottawa and the Citadelle in Quebec City. Each holds pieces from the Crown Collection. Though neither was used for their intended purpose, Hatley Castle in British Columbia was purchased in 1940 by the federal government for the use of George VI and his family during the Second World War and the Emergency Government Headquarters, built between 1959 and 1961 at CFS Carp and decommissioned in 1994, included a residential apartment for the sovereign or governor general in the case of a nuclear attack.

British royalty have also owned homes and land in Canada in a private capacity: Edward VIII owned Bedingfield Ranch, near Pekisko, Alberta; and Princess Margaret owned Portland Island, which was given to her by British Columbia in 1958. She offered it back to the province on permanent loan in 1961, which was accepted in 1966, and the island and surrounding waters eventually became Princess Margaret Marine Park.
In addition to a maître d&#x27;hôtel, chefs, footmen, valets, dressers, pages, aides-de-camp (drawn from the junior officers of the armed forces), equerries, and others at Rideau Hall, the King appoints various people to his Canadian household to assist him in carrying out his official duties on behalf of Canada. Along with the Canadian secretary to the King, the monarch&#x27;s entourage includes the equerry-in-waiting to the King, the King&#x27;s police officer, two ladies-in-waiting for the Queen, the King&#x27;s honorary physician, the King&#x27;s honorary dental surgeon, and the King&#x27;s honorary nursing officer—the latter three being drawn from the Canadian Forces. Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, also has a Canadian private secretary and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, a lady-in-waiting. Royal Canadian Air Force VIP aircraft are provided by 412 Transport Squadron.

There are three household regiments specifically attached to the royal household—the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards, the Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards, and the Canadian Grenadier Guards. There are also three chapels royal, all in Ontario: Mohawk Chapel in Brantford; Christ Church Royal Chapel, near Deseronto; and St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel in Massey College, in Toronto. Though not a chapel royal, St Bartholomew&#x27;s Anglican Church, located across MacKay Street from Rideau Hall, is regularly used by governors general and their families and sometimes by the sovereign and other visiting royalty, as well as by staff, their families, and members of the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards, for whom the church serves as a regimental chapel.

===Security===

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police is tasked with providing security to the sovereign, the governor general (starting from when he or she is made governor general-designate), and other members of the royal family; as outlined in the &quot;RCMP Regulations&quot;, the force &quot;has a duty to protect individuals designated by the minister of public safety, including certain members of the royal family when visiting.&quot; The RCMP&#x27;s provision of service is determined based on threat and risk assessment, the seniority of the individual in terms of precedence and. for members of the royal family, the nature of the royal tour—i.e. an official tour by the King or on behalf of the King or a working or private visit. The governor general receives round-the-clock security from the Governor General Protection Detail, part of the Personal Protection Group, based at Rideau Hall.

==History==

===From colonies to independence===
The Canadian monarchy can trace its ancestral lineage back to the kings of the Angles and the early Scottish kings and through the centuries since the claims of King Henry VII in 1497 and King Francis I in 1534; both being blood relatives of the current Canadian monarch. Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper said of the Crown that it &quot;links us all together with the majestic past that takes us back to the Tudors, the Plantagenets, Magna Carta, &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, petition of rights, and English common law.&quot; Though the first French and British colonizers of Canada interpreted the hereditary nature of some indigenous North American chieftainships as a form of monarchy, it is generally accepted that Canada has been a territory of a monarch or a monarchy in its own right only since the establishment of the French colony of Canada in the early 16th century; according to historian Jacques Monet, the Canadian Crown is one of the few that have survived through uninterrupted succession since before its inception.

After the Canadian colonies of France were, via war and treaties, ceded to the British Crown, and the population was greatly expanded by those loyal to George III fleeing north from persecution during and following the American Revolution, British North America was in 1867 confederated by Queen Victoria to form Canada as a kingdom in its own right. By the end of the First World War, the increased fortitude of Canadian nationalism inspired the country&#x27;s leaders to push for greater independence from the King in his British Council, resulting in the creation of the uniquely Canadian monarchy through the Statute of Westminster, which was granted royal assent in 1931. Only five years later, Canada had three successive kings in the space of one year, with the death of George V, the accession and abdication of Edward VIII, and his replacement by George VI.

From 1786 through to the 1930s, members of the royal family toured Canada, including Prince William (later King William IV); Prince Edward, Duke of Kent; Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII); Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn; John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, and Princess Louise; Prince Leopold; Princess Marie-Louise; Prince George, Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George V), and Princess Victoria (later Queen Mary); Prince Arthur (son of the Duke of Connaught); Princess Patricia; Prince Albert (later King George VI); Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII); Prince George, Duke of Kent; and Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.

===The Canadian Crown===
King George VI became in 1939 the first reigning monarch of Canada to tour the country, doing so with his wife, Queen Elizabeth. Only weeks later, the King, on the advice of his Canadian Prime Minister, declared war on Nazi Germany. Throughout the conflict, George boosted the morale of his Canadian troops while Governor General the Earl of Athlone (the King&#x27;s uncle) supported the war effort in Canada. The men were occasionally assisted in their efforts by other members of the royal family.
Elizabeth II undertook her first tour of Canada in 1951, when Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh. She would go on to officiate at various moments of importance in the nation&#x27;s history: She opened Parliament in 1957—on the same tour, delivering, from Rideau Hall, her first-ever live television broadcast—and in 1977; opened the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959; celebrated Canada&#x27;s centennial; and proclaimed the country to be fully independent, via constitutional patriation, in 1982. That act is said to have entrenched the monarchy in Canada, due to the stringent amending formula that must be followed in order to alter the monarchy in any way.

Through the 1960s and 1970s, the rise of Quebec nationalism and changes in Canadian identity created an atmosphere where the purpose and role of the monarchy came into question. Some references to the monarch and the monarchy were removed from the public eye and moves were made by the federal government to constitutionally alter the Crown&#x27;s place and role in Canada, first by explicit legal amendments and later by subtle attrition. But, provincial and federal ministers, along with loyal national citizen&#x27;s organizations, ensured that the system remained the same in essence.

The Queen publicly expressed her personal support for the Meech Lake Accord, which attempted to bring Quebec governmental support to the patriated constitution. The accord failed, prompting Elizabeth to deliver a nationally-broadcast speech in Ottawa supporting Canadian unity. In the lead-up to the referendum on Quebec independence in 1995, the Queen was tricked by a Montreal radio DJ into revealing her desire to see the &quot;no&quot; side win, offering to help however she could. Elizabeth followed the results closely on the day of the vote.

Members of the royal family continued to be present at important national events through the decades: the Queen in 1970, 1971, and 1973, respectively, marked the anniversaries of Manitoba, British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island becoming Canadian provinces; celebrated Ontario&#x27;s and New Brunswick&#x27;s bicentennials in 1984 and the 125th anniversary of Confederation in 1992; and she opened the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and Nunavut&#x27;s parliament in 1999. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, attended the 100th anniversary of Treaty 7 in 1977; commemorated in 1983 the bicentennial of United Empire Loyalists settling in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; and, with Diana, Princess of Wales, opened Expo 86 in Vancouver. Between them, the Queen and her family opened numerous Commonwealth Games, Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings, conferences, hospitals, community centres, and the like; handed out The Duke of Edinburgh Awards at ceremonies across the country, and visited many regiments and branches of the Canadian Armed Forces.

===The 21st century===

By 2002, the royal tour and associated fêtes for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee proved popular with Canadians across the country, though Canada&#x27;s first republican organization since the 1830s was also founded that year. Celebrations took place across the country to mark the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 2012, the first such event in Canada since that for Victoria in 1897. On 9 September 2015, she became the second-longest reigning monarch in Canadian history (preceded only by King Louis XIV); events were organized to celebrate her as the &quot;longest-reigning sovereign in Canada&#x27;s modern era.&quot; Prince Charles represented his mother, the Queen, two years later, at the main events in Ottawa recognizing the 150th anniversary of Confederation.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Queen expressed her support for all Canadians and thanks to those who were caring for the vulnerable and providing essential services. As the pandemic waned into 2022, celebrations were mounted around the country and throughout the year to mark the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee; the first-ever such event in Canadian history. It was also, though, the first time since at least Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 1887 that the federal Cabinet did not advise the Crown to create an associated medal. In response, six provinces produced their own Platinum Jubilee medals; another first.

The subject of reconciliation with Canada&#x27;s Indigenous peoples came to the forefront of the public consciousness in 2021, particularly in regard to residential schools. Statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II in Winnipeg were vandalized. On the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, Elizabeth made a public statement, saying she &quot;joins with all Canadians [...] to reflect on the painful history that Indigenous peoples endured in residential schools in Canada and on the work that remains to heal and to continue to build an inclusive society.&quot; In the same year, the Queen appointed Mary Simon as the first Indigenous governor general in Canadian history. During Charles&#x27;s tour for his mother&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee, the BBC&#x27;s royal correspondent observed that &quot;there [was] no shying away from acknowledging and highlighting the scandalous way many indigenous peoples have been treated in Canada.&quot;

Queen Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022 and was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III. The Queen&#x27;s final public statement was issued on 7 September, in the aftermath of the 2022 Saskatchewan stabbings, stating she &quot;mourn[s] with all Canadians at this tragic time.&quot; Elizabeth reigned for almost half of Canada&#x27;s history since Confederation, being only the sixth Canadian monarch since 1867.

Immediately following a formal meeting of the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, the new king was proclaimed on 10 September in a ceremony at Rideau Hall. On 4 May 2023, the King held audience with Simon and Indigenous leaders, who also attended his coronation two days later.

==Public perception and understanding==
Prior to the 1970s, Canadians&#x27; view of the monarchy was more focused on the person of the monarch than the institution&#x27;s place in the country&#x27;s framework. Smith, in 2017, and Jackson, in 2018, observed the shift continuing, especially as &quot;the process of &#x27;Canadianization&#x27; of the Crown picked up momentum in the early 21st century.&quot;

Still, beginning in the later decades of the 20th century, commentators stated that contemporary Canadians had and have a poor understanding of the Canadian monarchy; something the Monarchist League of Canada (MLC) claims opponents of the monarchy exacerbate by spreading disinformation and then take advantage of. Jackson wrote in his book, &quot;The Crown and Canadian Federalism&quot;, that this is part of a wider ignorance about Canadian civics and Hugo Cyr agreed, while Smith researched for his 1995 book, &quot;The Invisible Crown&quot;, he found it difficult to &quot;find anyone who could talk knowledgeably about the subject&quot;. Former Governors General Clarkson and Johnston made similar observations and Senator Lowell Murray wrote in 2003, &quot;the Crown has become irrelevant to most Canadians&#x27; understanding of our system of government&quot;, which he attributed to the &quot;fault of successive generations of politicians, of an educational system that has never given the institution due study, and of past viceregal incumbents themselves&quot;.
On education, teacher and author Nathan Tidridge asserted that, beginning in the 1960s, the role of the Crown disappeared from provincial education curricula, as the general subject of civics came to receive less attention. He said Canadians are being &quot;educated to be illiterate, ambivalent, or even hostile toward our constitutional monarchy&quot;. The MLC agreed, stating Canada has &quot;an educational system which unfortunately often fails to provide comprehensive knowledge of Canada&#x27;s constitution.&quot;

Michael Valpy also pointed to the fact that &quot;the Crown&#x27;s role in the machinery of Canada&#x27;s constitutional monarchy rarely sees daylight. Only a handful of times in our history has it been subjected to glaring sunshine, unfortunately resulting in a black hole of public understanding as to how it works.&quot; He later iterated, &quot;the public&#x27;s attention span on the constitutional intricacies of the monarchy is clinically short&quot;. At the same time, it has been theorized the monarchy is so prevalent in Canada—by way of all manner of symbols, place names, royal tours, etcetera—that Canadians fail to take note of it; the monarchy &quot;functions like a tasteful wallpaper pattern in Canada: enjoyable in an absent-minded way, but so ubiquitous as to be almost invisible&quot;.

John Pepall argued in 1990 that, among all this, a &quot;Liberal-inspired republican misconception of the role&quot; of governor general had taken root, though the Conservative government headed by Brian Mulroney exacerbated the matter. The position of prime minister has simultaneously undergone, with encouragement from its occupants, what has been described as a &quot;presidentialization&quot;, to the point that its incumbents publicly outshine the actual head of state. David S. Donovan felt Canadians mostly consider the monarch and her representatives as purely ceremonial and symbolic figures, while also still viewing the sovereign as British, even if they understand he is King of Canada. It was argued by Alfred Neitsch that this undermined the Crown&#x27;s legitimacy as a check and balance in the governmental system, a situation Helen Forsey (daughter of Canadian constitutional expert Eugene Forsey) said prime ministers take advantage of, portraying themselves as the embodiment of popular democracy and the reserve powers of the Crown as illegitimate. The issue is particularly acute in Quebec, where sovereigntist politicians consider the Canadian monarchy as British, foreign, and, consequently, as symbol of oppression.

Beginning slightly earlier, a &quot;growing interest in the Crown and its prerogatives&quot; was observed, as evidenced by &quot;a burst of articles, books and conferences&quot;; the monarchy attracted increased attention from academics, as well as those involved with the law, government, and public policy. This was attributed to the coincidental occurrence of publicly prominent events over a number of years, including the 2008 prorogation dispute; an increased use of royal symbols as directed by the Cabinet while headed by Stephen Harper, including three consecutive royal tours; court cases focusing on the Oath of Citizenship; and increasingly active governors. Smith and Lagassé noted in early 2016 that post-secondary students were giving more focus to the subject of the Crown.

Some Canadians have taken the opposite extreme view of the Crown&#x27;s powers, such as when, in 2013, the leader of the Green Party of Canada, Elizabeth May, wrote to Queen Elizabeth II asking her to call a &quot;royal inquiry&quot; to &quot;investigate what may potentially be criminal activities which [sic] influenced Canada&#x27;s last election&quot; and &quot;restore Canada to a free and fair democracy.&quot; The monarch&#x27;s secretary instructed May, &quot;as a constitutional sovereign, Her Majesty acts through her personal representative, the Governor-General, on the advice of her Canadian ministers and it is to them that your appeal should be directed.&quot; So many protesters involved in the 2022 Freedom Convoy called and emailed the office of Governor General Mary Simon to pressure her into dismissing her Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, or dissolving Parliament that Simon made a rare public statement on the role of the governor general. Lagassé pointed to that as &quot;evidence of a recent trend in protest movements&quot;, saying, &quot;it has become routine in Canadian politics to write a letter to the Queen, Governor General, or a lieutenant governor asking them to exercise their powers in some way, contrary to constitutional conventions. This is political theatre, no more.&quot;
The relationship between Canada&#x27;s Indigenous peoples and the monarch remains unchanged, aside from the issue of reconciliation arising in it through the late 2010s into the 2020s, when there were some assertions by activists and in the media that the monarchy and the Queen herself represented colonialism and racism and she did not do enough to either prevent or rectify supposed offences. Those who made such claims also, though, mistook the independent Canadian Crown as the British Crown in Canada and demonstrated a misunderstanding of the Crown-Indigenous peoples relationship and the workings of constitutional monarchy and responsible government, in which the sovereign must, outside of constitutional crises, follow the directions of his or her ministers and parliamentarians. The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, claimed in 2022, &quot;we cannot overlook that she [Queen Elizabeth II] represented an institution, the British Crown, that has caused significant harm to Quebecers and Indigenous nations.&quot;

Within Quebec, too, the Canadian Crown is frequently misrepresented as the British Crown and that false foreignness used in political, particularly sovereigntist, discourse as an argument in favour of extracting the Crown from Quebec or Quebec from Canada. For instance, in the televised Radio-Canada leaders&#x27; debate on 22 September 2022, during that year&#x27;s general election in the province, the moderator, , asked the panel, with &quot;incredulous chuckles&quot;, &quot;should we still, in Quebec, swear allegiance to the British Crown, thus Charles III [to take one&#x27;s seat in the National Assembly]?&quot; Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet on 26 October 2022 tabled a motion in the House of Commons proposing that the &quot;House express its desire to sever ties between the Canadian state and the British monarchy.&quot; This motion was defeated 266 to 44.

== Debate ==
Outside of academic circles, there has been little national debate on the monarchy. The position of monarch in Canada is highly protected by the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;—which mandates that any major constitutional amendment, such as any change to the monarchy, must receive unanimous consent of the Senate, the House of Commons, and all 10 provincial legislative assemblies—and treaties between the Crown and Indigenous peoples that play a role in entrenching the monarchy.
Canada has two special-interest groups representing the debate, who occasionally argue the issue in the media: the Monarchist League of Canada (MLC) and Citizens for a Canadian Republic. There are also other organizations that support and advocate the monarchy, such as the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada, the Canadian Royal Heritage Trust, the Friends of the Canadian Crown, Canadian Friends of the Royal Family, the , the Orange Order in Canada, and the United Empire Loyalists&#x27; Association of Canada.

Out of Canada&#x27;s four most prominent political parties, neither the Liberal Party nor the Conservative Party are officially in favour of abolishing the monarchy (the Conservative Party cite support for constitutional monarchy as a founding principle in its policy declaration) and the New Democratic Party has no official position on the role of the Crown. Only some members of Parliament belonging to these parties and the leaders of the Bloc Québécois have made any statements suggesting abolition of the monarchy.

Opinion polls on the Canadian monarchy have been regularly conducted since the 1990s. An analysis of these polls in 2008 highlighted an increased disaffection with the monarchy, albeit with internal contradictions in specific polling results, with some criticizing the polling questions for using &quot;inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous wording.&quot; Questions often describe the monarch or monarchy as &quot;British&quot;, terminology at odds with the contemporary situation in Canada, wherein the monarchy is a Canadian institution, separate from that of the United Kingdom, and it, the Crown, and royal family are referred to as Canadian. Both monarchists and republicans agree the populace&#x27;s general lack of understanding about the monarchy affects opinions.

The idea of a uniquely Canadian monarch, either one descended from the House of Windsor or coming from a First Nations royal house, has been proffered as an alternative. However, there has been no popular or official support for such a change.

<text>Schoharie County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 29,714, making it the state&#x27;s fifth-least populous county. The county seat is Schoharie. &quot;Schoharie&quot; comes from a Mohawk word meaning &quot;floating driftwood.&quot; Schoharie County is part of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area and thus the Capital District of New York. The county is part of the Mohawk Valley region of the state.

==History==
The large territory of the county was long occupied by the Mohawk Nation and, to the west, the other four tribes of the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) Confederacy (increased to six with the migration of the Tuscarora). After European colonization of the Northeast started, the Mohawk had a lucrative fur trade with the French coming down from Canada, as well as the early Dutch colonists, and later British and German colonists.

Some Palatine Germans, who worked in camps on the Hudson to pay off their passage in 1710, later settled in this county in the 1720s and 30s. In addition, Scots-Irish immigrants settled in the present Schoharie County area before the American Revolutionary War, especially near Cherry Creek.

===Political organization===
After Great Britain defeated the Dutch in the Second Anglo-Dutch War and received New Netherland via the Treaty of Breda, they began to establish counties in the New York territory in 1683. The present Schoharie County was first part of Albany County. In theory, it extended westward to the Pacific Ocean, as the colonists wanted to keep their options open. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now part of Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one retaining the name Albany County. Tryon County was formed from the western portion of the territory (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated Tryon County was eventually organized into what are now 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.

In the years preceding 1776, as social and political tensions rose in the colony, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County, then on the frontier, fled to Canada. In 1784, after the peace treaty that ended the Revolutionary War and the establishment of states, the new government changed Tryon County&#x27;s name to Montgomery County to honor United States General Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died trying to capture the city of Quebec.

The state continued to organize new counties. In 1789, Montgomery County was reduced in size by the splitting off of Ontario County. It was originally much larger than the present county, including present-day Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne counties.

In 1791, Otsego County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being Herkimer and Tioga County).

In 1795, Schoharie County was created by joining portions of Otsego and Albany counties.

===Revolutionary War===
This was an area of fighting during the American Revolutionary War. On the frontier, colonists were subject to raids by British and their Iroquois allies. Four of the six tribes allied with the British, hoping to repel the colonists from their territory.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.7%) is water.

Schoharie County is in central New York State, west of Albany and southeast of Utica.

Much of the southern portion of the county lies within the Catskill Mountains. Land rises in both directions quite rapidly from Schoharie Creek in the middle of the county. In contrast, the northern part of the county is predominately small hills and valleys. More than 75% of the county&#x27;s population lives in the north, closer to the Mohawk River, the historic transportation route east and west through the state. Schoharie Creek is a northward-flowing tributary of the Mohawk River. The Schoharie Creek watershed spans an area of approximately . The course of Schoharie Creek includes two reservoir-dam systems.

The Gilboa Dam and the Schoharie Reservoir are part of the New York City Water Supply System. The New York Power Authority operates the Blenheim-Gilboa Dam and its reservoir to produce hydroelectric power. The headwaters of the Delaware River are located in the town of Jefferson. Tributaries of the Susquehanna River are located in the towns of Jefferson and Summit.

The highest point is at the summit of Huntersfield Mountain on the southern boundary with Greene County, at above sea level. The lowest point is where the Montgomery County line meets Schoharie Creek, above sea level. The most prominent geological feature is Vroman&#x27;s Nose, near the village of Middleburgh in the town of Fulton.

==Economy==
Schoharie County&#x27;s primary industry is agriculture. Farms are situated all over the county and farm stands and other agriculture-related businesses are operated throughout the county. Many residents work in the Capital District, New York. Walmart has a distribution center in the Village of Sharon Springs. The I-88 corridor is growing due to the short commute to Schenectady and Albany.

The Catskills-area villages have a number of historic hotels, as it was a vacation destination in the early 20th century. Second homes are common in the county.

A growing tourist industry attracts visitors for recreation, the landscape and historic destinations. Visitors come to Howe Caverns, Vroman&#x27;s Nose, the Old Stone Fort, and the Iroquois Indian Museum among other locales. The Old Blenheim Bridge was among the attractions until it was destroyed by Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Work to rebuild the covered bridge began in 2017.

<doc id="56506" wikidata="Q487605" url="?curid=56506" title="Saratoga County, New York">
<text>Saratoga County is a county in the U.S. state of New York, and is the fastest-growing county in Upstate New York. As of the 2020 United States census, the county&#x27;s population was enumerated at 235,509, its highest decennial count ever and a 7.2% increase from the 219,607 recorded at the 2010 census, representing one of the fastest growth rates in New York. The county seat is Ballston Spa. The county is part of the Capital District region of the state.

Saratoga County&#x27;s name was derived from the Iroquois word &quot;sah-rah-ka&quot; or &quot;sarach-togue&quot;, meaning &quot;the hill beside the river&quot;, referring to the Hudson River bordering the county on its eastern flank and the Mohawk River delineating its southern border. Saratoga County, bisected by the toll-free, six-lane Adirondack Northway, serves as an outdoor recreational haven and as the gateway to the Adirondack Mountains and State Park for the populations of the Albany and New York City metropolitan areas. The county is also home to the internationally renowned Saratoga Race Course, one of the oldest venues in horse racing.

Saratoga County lies in the heart of eastern New York State&#x27;s recognized Tech Valley, a growing center for the computer hardware side of the high-technology industry and its concomitant venture capital investment, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector, digital electronics design, and water- and electricity-dependent integrated microchip circuit manufacturing, and more recently, artificial intelligence, involving companies including IBM, GlobalFoundries, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor, among others. In April 2021, GlobalFoundries, a company specializing in the semiconductor industry, moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley, California to its most advanced semiconductor-chip manufacturing facility in Saratoga County near a section of the Adirondack Northway, in Malta, New York.

The county is also frequently recognized for its high standard of living and quality of life. Saratoga County touts its strongly academic schools, clean environment and relatively cool climate, abundance of clean water and electricity, natural beauty and recreational opportunities, low county tax rates, and availability of new housing in its approach to robust growth in the county&#x27;s high-tech workforce.

==History==

When counties were established in the Province of New York in 1683, the present Saratoga County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York, as well as all of the present state of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This large county was progressively reduced in size by the separation of several counties until 1791, when Saratoga County and Rensselaer County were split off from Albany County. The Battles of Saratoga (September 19 and October 7, 1777) marked the climax of the Saratoga campaign, giving a decisive victory to the Americans over the British in the American Revolutionary War, which convinced France that the Thirteen Colonies could win the war. The government of Louis XVI began lending military and financial aid to the American Patriot cause.

During the 19th century, Saratoga County was an important industrial center. Its location 30 miles north of Albany on the Delaware and Hudson Railway, as well as its proximity to water power from the Hudson River and the Kayaderosseras Creek, led to rapid industrial development beginning in the early 19th century. Some of the most important industrial employers were paper mills, tanneries, foundries, and textile mills.

Since the construction of the Adirondack Northway in the 1960s, Saratoga County has consistently been the fastest-growing county in the Capital District and indeed, in Upstate New York, and one of the fastest-growing in the Northeastern United States. The county has historically maintained a low county tax rate; according to its official website, Saratoga County levies one of the lowest county tax rates in New York.

==Economy==

===Tech Valley===
Since the 2000s, the economy of Saratoga County and the surrounding Capital District has been redirected toward high technology. Tech Valley is a marketing name for the eastern part of New York, encompassing Saratoga County, the Capital District, and the Hudson Valley. Originated in 1998 to promote the greater Albany area as a high-tech competitor to regions such as Silicon Valley and Boston, it has since grown to represent the counties in the Capital District and extending to IBM&#x27;s Westchester County plants in the south and the Canada–US border to the north. The area&#x27;s high-technology ecosystem is supported by technologically focused academic institutions including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute. Tech Valley encompasses 19 counties straddling both sides of the Adirondack Northway and the New York Thruway, and with heavy state taxpayer subsidy, has experienced significant growth in the computer hardware side of the high-technology industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector, digital electronics design, and water- and electricity-dependent integrated microchip circuit manufacturing, and more recently, artificial intelligence, involving companies including GlobalFoundries in Malta and others. Saratoga County touts its high standard of living and quality of life, strongly academic schools, clean environment and relatively cool climate, abundance of clean water and electricity, natural beauty and recreational opportunities, low county rax rates, and availability of new housing in its approach to robust growth in the county&#x27;s high-tech workforce.

==Government==













Saratoga County is governed by a Board Of Supervisors, with each town Supervisor acting as the representative from that community. The City of Saratoga Springs elects two Supervisors and the City of Mechanicville elects one supervisor to sit on the Board of Supervisors, but have no power in their respective city governments. The Town of Clifton Park also elects two Supervisors, one being the elected Town Supervisor, and one having only County duties. Voting is by weighted vote of each of the communities based on population, which is the reason why Saratoga Springs and Clifton Park, the two largest communities in Saratoga County, elect two Supervisors. The political makeup of the 2016-17 Board consists of 21 Republicans, and two Democrats. By long-standing tradition, whoever serves as chairman of the Board of Supervisor&#x27;s powerful Law and Finance Committee one year serves as chairman of the full Board the following year—a tradition that has been broken only three times in Saratoga County&#x27;s history. Under this custom, current Law and Finance Committee Chairman Arthur &quot;Mo&quot; Wright, the Supervisor of the Town of Hadley, is slated to become chairman of the full Board in 2016. Republicans hold the county-wide offices of sheriff, district attorney, county clerk, treasurer, and judges of the county, family, and the surrogate courts.

On the presidential level, like most of the Hudson Valley, Saratoga County was historically powerfully Republican. It only supported a Democrat for president twice in the 20th century, in 1964 and 1996. The Republican edge narrowed somewhat in the 1990s and since then Saratoga County has been a Republican-leaning swing county. George W. Bush won the county narrowly in 2004 with 53% of the vote, while Barack Obama slightly edged out John McCain and Mitt Romney in both 2008 and 2012, becoming the first Democrat to win a majority in the county since 1964. In 2016, Saratoga County flipped back to the Republicans, with Donald Trump capturing a narrow plurality of the vote over Hillary Clinton. The flip proved to be temporary, with Democratic candidate Joe Biden winning the county in 2020.

The county is represented in the U.S. Congress by Republican Elise Stefanik and Democrat Paul Tonko. In the State Senate, the county is divided between Republicans Daphne Jordan and Jim Tedisco, while in the State Assembly Democrats John T. McDonald III and Carrie Woerner, along with Republicans Mary Beth Walsh and Dan Stec, each represent portions of the county.

James A. Murphy III, a Republican, is the County Court Judge and a former District Attorney. James A. Bowen had been the dean of NYS Sheriffs, having served as Sheriff since 1972, when he was appointed by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. Bowen won election in his own right in 1973 and had been elected every four years up until his retirement at the end of his tenth term in office in 2013. Michael H. Zurlo is the current Sheriff, winning the election to succeed Bowen in 2013. Democratic strength is best shown in the City of Saratoga Springs, which has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1988. Republican strength is concentrated in the western part of the county, which is mostly rural or exurban. In 2005, the Democrats gained a majority on the Saratoga Springs City Council after decades of Republican dominance. The Republicans, however, reclaimed the council majority in the 2007 General Elections due to a split Democratic Party in the mayor&#x27;s race. In 2009, the Republicans reclaimed their supermajority (4-1) on the City Council, by winning every contested election (Mayor, Finance, Public Safety, and Public Works). In 2011, Democrats reclaimed the Majority on the City Council, while Republican Scott Johnson was reelected as Mayor. The Current City Council (2016-2017)is 4-1 Democratic led by Mayor Meg Kelly. At the Saratoga County Board of Supervisors, the city is split, with one Republican and one Democrat holding the two Supervisor seats.

<doc id="56507" wikidata="Q1365906" url="?curid=56507" title="Marlinespike hitch">
<text>The marlinespike hitch is a temporary knot used to attach a rod to a rope in order to form a handle. This allows more tension than could be produced comfortably by gripping the rope with the hands alone. It is useful when tightening knots and for other purposes in ropework.

As the name suggests, the type of rod traditionally used with this hitch is a marlinespike. The advantages of this hitch over others which might serve the purpose are its quickness of tying and ease of releasing. Topologically it is a form of the noose, but in practice this hitch is not allowed to collapse into that shape. When it does capsize into a traditional noose, it can jam against the rod, making it much more difficult to release.

The hitch is frequently used by hammock campers to attach adjustable rope slings (&quot;whoopie slings&quot;) to the webbing straps that are used to attach hammocks to trees.

By passing the working end through the marlinespike hitch, this knot can be used as an alternative method of tying the Bowline knot. Passing through in the opposite direction will give you the Cowboy bowline (also known as the left-hand bowline, Dutch marine bowline or winter bowline).

==Tying==

Below is a basic method of tying. The knot can also be made by using the rod itself to form the loop, but the tying method does not affect the performance of the resulting hitch.

Begin with an overhand loop, that is, a loop in which the working part passes over the standing part:&lt;br&gt;
Fold the loop over the working part, towards the standing part such that the standing part is visible through the center of the loop:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In stiffer material the first two steps can be accomplished in a single motion by twisting the working part with the fingers until a loop forms and flops over the standing part.

Use the rod to snag a bight of the standing part through the loop, that is, pass the rod over the near side of the loop, under the standing part and then over the far side of the loop:&lt;br&gt;
Before tensioning, excess slack can be removed by pulling &quot;simultaneously&quot; on both the working and standing parts:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In actual use the hitch should be loaded only from the standing side.

===Undesirable capsized form===

If the working end is loaded rather than the standing part, the knot will capsize into an overhand noose:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
While this form may still hold when the standing part is subsequently loaded, it can jam badly against the rod. This is especially troublesome if the rod is not tapered.

<text>Judith Beatrice Bari (November 7, 1949 – March 2, 1997) was an American environmentalist, feminist, and labor leader, primarily active in Northern California after moving to the state in the mid-1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, she was the principal organizer of Earth First! campaigns against logging in the ancient redwood forests of Mendocino County and related areas. She also organized Industrial Workers of the World Local 1 in an effort to bring together timber workers and environmentalists of Earth First! in common cause.

Bari suffered severe injuries on 24 May 1990 in Oakland, California, when a pipe bomb went off under her seat in her car. She was driving with colleague Darryl Cherney, who had minor injuries. They were arrested by Oakland Police, aided by the FBI, who accused them of transporting a bomb for terrorist purposes. While those charges were dropped, in 1991 the pair filed suit against the Oakland Police Department and FBI for violations of their civil rights during the investigation of the bombing. A jury found in their favor when the case went to trial in 2002, and damages were awarded to Bari&#x27;s estate and Cherney. Bari had died of cancer in 1997. The bombing has not been solved.

In 1999 a bill was passed to establish the Headwaters Forest Reserve (H.R. 2107, Title V. Sec.501.) under administration by the Bureau of Land Management. This protected of mixed old-growth and previously harvested forest. It was a project that Bari had long supported.

==Early life and education==
Bari was born on November 7, 1949, and was raised in Silver Spring, Maryland, the daughter of mathematician Ruth Aaronson Bari, who became a recognized mathematician, and diamond setter Arthur Bari. Her parents were Jewish and Italian in ancestry, respectively. The elder Baris were both active in left-wing politics; they advocated for civil rights and opposed the Vietnam War. Judi Bari was the second of three daughters; her older sister is Gina Kolata, a science journalist for the &quot;New York Times&quot;; and younger is Martha Bari, an art historian.

Although Judi Bari attended the University of Maryland for five years, she dropped out without graduating. She said that her college career was most notable for &quot;anti-Vietnam War rioting&quot;.

Bari began working as a clerk for a chain grocery store and became a union organizer in its work force. At her next job as a mail handler, she organized a wildcat strike in the United States Postal Service bulk mail facility in Maryland.

== Move to California, marriage and family ==
Bari moved to the Bay Area in Northern California, which was a center of political activism. In 1978 she met her future husband Michael Sweeney at a labor organizers&#x27; conference. They shared an interest in radical politics. Sweeney had graduated from Stanford University, and for a time in the early 1970s had been a member of the Maoist group Venceremos, which had mostly Chicano members. He had been married before.

In 1979, Bari and Sweeney married and settled in Santa Rosa, California. They had two daughters together, Lisa (1981) and Jessica (1985). The couple divorced in 1988 and shared custody of their children.

==Political and conservation activities==
During the early to mid-1980s, Bari devoted herself to Pledge of Resistance, a group that opposed US policies in Central America. She was a self-proclaimed virtuoso on the bullhorn. She edited, wrote, and drew cartoons for political leaflets and publications.

Around 1985, Bari moved north with her husband and two children to the vicinity of Redwood Valley in Mendocino County, California. It was an area of old timber towns, such as Eureka and Fortuna, and a new wave of hippies and young counter-culture adults who migrated here from urban areas.

In 1986, Houston millionaire Charles Hurwitz acquired Pacific Lumber Company, with assets in Northern California, including in redwood forests. He doubled the company&#x27;s rate of timber harvesting as a means of paying off the acquisition cost. This enraged environmentalists. The federal government also investigated the transaction because of Hurwitz&#x27;s use of junk bonds. Activist protests against old-growth timber harvesting by Pacific Lumber became the focus of Earth First! in the following years.

On May 8, 1987, a sawmill accident occurred at the Louisiana Pacific mill in Cloverdale, California. Mill worker George Alexander nearly died of injuries suffered when a saw blade struck a spike in a log being milled, generating shrapnel. Adverse publicity resulted.

Earth First!, which at that point still promoted &quot;monkeywrenching&quot; as part of its tactics, was blamed by the company and some workers for the spike because of incidents of equipment sabotage that had taken place in the vicinity where the log was harvested. But responsibility for the spike was not determined. However, it was later confirmed that the prime suspect in the case was not an Earth First! activist but a local &quot;disgruntled&quot; landowner.

The bad publicity from the incident resulted in Earth First! disavowing tree spiking (but not other forms of sabotage).

In 1988, Bari was instrumental in starting Local 1 of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which allied with Earth First! in protests against cutting old growth redwoods. Bari used her labor organizing background to run a workshop on the Industrial Workers of the World at an Earth First! rendezvous in California. Through the formation of EF!–IWW Local 1, she sought to bring together environmentalists and timber workers who were concerned about the harvest rate by the timber industry. She believed they had interests in common.

That year, Bari organized the first forest blockade, to promote expanding the South Fork Eel River Wilderness, managed by the US Bureau of Land Management. Related to her other interests, that year Bari also organized a counter-demonstration to protect a Planned Parenthood clinic in Ukiah.

Many timber workers believed that the environmentalists were threatening their livelihoods. At this time, environmentalists were backing their legal suits against timber overcutting by staging blockades of job sites in the woods and tree sitting. Loggers saw such actions as harassment. Confrontations between loggers and demonstrators were often heated and sometimes violent. Reactions to Bari&#x27;s involvement in the protests were severe: her car was rammed by a logging truck in 1989, and she received death threats.

In August 1989, environmentalist Mem Hill suffered a broken nose in a protest confrontation with loggers in the woods. She filed a legal suit accusing a logger of assault, and claiming law enforcement did not protect her from attack.

Bari emphasized non-violent action and began to incorporate music into her demonstrations. She played the fiddle and sang original compositions by Darryl Cherney, who played guitar. Sometimes she sang her own songs. Their song titles and lyrics aroused controversy, as many listeners considered them offensive. Cherney&#x27;s song about tree spiking, &quot;Spike a Tree for Jesus&quot; is one example; &quot;Will This Fetus Be Aborted?&quot;, sung as a counter-protest to an anti-abortion rally, was another.

The media portrayed her as an obstructionist saboteur. Some activists and area residents found Bari to be egocentric, humorless, and strident. Her tactics often rankled not only members of the timber industry and political establishment, but fellow activists.

Differences emerged between Bari and her husband over their political paths and diverging lives. He headed a recycling company in the county. They struggled to reconcile political action with the obligations of parenting. In 1988, with a divorce between herself and her husband underway, she met Darryl Cherney. They began a romantic relationship based partly on shared political beliefs, and appeared together at various protests (as noted above).

In 1990, the Sierra Club withdrew its support from legislation amending California Forest Practice Rules and moving forward with a process to establish a Headwaters Forest preserve on Pacific Lumber Company land. They submitted a voter initiative, Proposition 130, dubbed &quot;Forests Forever.&quot; The timber industry was strongly opposed to it. In response, environmentalists began organizing Redwood Summer, a campaign of nonviolent protests focused on slowing harvest of redwood forests in Northern California until such forests gained extra protections under Proposition 130. They named their campaign in honor of the 1964 Freedom Summer of the Civil Rights Movement. Bari was instrumental in recruiting demonstrators from college campuses across the United States. But on November 6, 1990, Proposition 130 was defeated by California voters, with 52.1% against. Opponents emphasized the disruptive activities of Redwood Summer, which interfered with timber workers, and the support of Earth First! for Proposition 130. It had been accused of sabotage and violence against workers in the past.

During organizing for Redwood Summer, Bari directed efforts in Mendocino County, and Cherney went on the road to recruit activists. Bari had local connections and a rapport with some lumber industry workers that was developed during her organizing efforts of an IWW local. While recruiting, Cherney was kept at a distance, so that his reputation for advocating sabotage and propensity for hostile outbursts toward timber workers could not damage the campaign.

On April 22, 1990, a group called Earth Night Action Group sabotaged power poles in southern Santa Cruz County, causing power outages. Upon hearing of that incident, Bari reportedly said, &quot;Desperate times call for desperate measures,&quot; and &quot;So what if some ice cream melted?&quot; Observers interpreted her statements as approval of sabotage, and thought Earth First! might still be involved in such activities. A provocative flyer was publicized that had been written by Cherney: he called for &quot;Earth Night&quot; actions, and it featured images of a monkey wrench, an earth mover, and figures representing saboteurs in the night. Cherney said the flyer was facetious. The identities of members of the Earth Night Action Group has never been established; their relationship to Earth First! was a matter of speculation.

On May 9, 1990, a failed incendiary pipe bomb was discovered in the Louisiana Pacific sawmill in Cloverdale. A hand-lettered sign, saying &quot;L-P screws millworkers&quot;, had been placed outside the mill. Responsibility for the bomb was never established.

On May 22, 1990, Bari met with local loggers to agree on ground rules for nonviolence during the Redwood Summer demonstrations. In the early afternoon of May 23, 1990, Bari started a road trip to Santa Cruz to organize for Redwood Summer and related musical events. She stopped for a press conference in Ukiah and for a meeting at the Seeds of Peace collective house in Berkeley.

That night she stayed overnight in Oakland, at a house near MacArthur and Park boulevards. On May 24 she and Darryl Cherney (as passenger) drove away from the house, and a short time later a bomb exploded beneath her seat. She suffered severe injuries and Cherney suffered lesser ones.

==Car bombing attempt on Bari&#x27;s life==
===Summary===
On May 24, 1990, in Oakland, California, Bari and Darryl Cherney were traveling in her car when it was blown up by a pipe bomb under her seat. Bari was driving and severely injured by the blast. Cherney suffered minor injuries. Bari was arrested for transporting explosives while she was still in critical condition with a fractured pelvis and other major injuries.

FBI bomb investigators reached the scene nearly simultaneously with first responders from the Oakland Police Department. Bari raised suspicion that the FBI knew about the bomb beforehand and might have been responsible for it. In Bari&#x27;s words, it was as if the investigators were &quot;waiting around the corner with their fingers in their ears.&quot; It was later revealed that there had been a tip to law enforcement, suspected to be from the person responsible for the bomb, that &quot;some heavies&quot; were carrying a bomb south for sabotage in the Santa Cruz area.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) took jurisdiction of the case away from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, alleging it was an eco-terrorism case. The Oakland Police Department of Alameda County was the local agency on the case. Bari&#x27;s wounds disabled her to the extent she had to curtail her activities. As Bari convalesced, other activists carried out Redwood Summer, conducting a series of demonstrations by thousands of environmental activists.

In late July 1990, the Alameda County District Attorney declined to press charges against Bari and Cherney, claiming insufficient evidence. But Bari and Cherney filed a civil rights suit in 1991 for violations by the FBI and Oakland Police because of the arrests and search warrants carried out on their properties. The trial was not concluded until 2002. Bari died of breast cancer in 1997. The jury found that their civil rights had been violated. The court made an award of $4.4 million to Cherney and Bari&#x27;s estate.

===Events of investigation===
When the Oakland police and the FBI initially accused Bari and Cherney of knowingly carrying a bomb for use in an act of terrorism, the story made headlines nationwide. By 3:00 p.m. of the day of the bombing, Bari was arrested for transportation of illegal explosives. She was still being treated in Highland Hospital.

Because of Earth First! had earlier developed a reputation for sabotage, the media reported the police version of events. For example, a KQED news report, entitled &quot;Focus: Logjam&quot;, used the term &quot;radical&quot; to describe Earth First!, blamed them for having sabotaged loggers&#x27; equipment and conducting tree spiking, and tied Bari&#x27;s bombing in with such actions.

Based on his personal observations of bomb damage to the car, FBI Special Agent Frank Doyle filed a public affidavit that the bomb had been carried on the back seat floorboard of Bari&#x27;s vehicle. The FBI was granted a search warrant on May 25 at 2:21 a.m., and agents used a helicopter to quickly reach Bari&#x27;s home and search it. Agents also searched the premises of the &quot;Seeds of Peace&quot; house in Berkeley, where Bari and Cherney had visited the day before the explosion. Members of Seeds of Peace were repeatedly interviewed; they said that they repeatedly told police that Bari and Cherney were committed to nonviolence.

Within a week, supporters of Bari and Cherney were petitioning for an investigation of the FBI&#x27;s investigative methods. Daniel Hamburg, a former Mendocino County Supervisor, and others complained that the investigation seemed focused on charging the two environmentalists.

On July 6, a new search warrant for Bari&#x27;s home was granted, as investigators sought exemplars of typewriting to compare to the typewritten The &quot;Lord&#x27;s Avenger&quot;.(See more below)

FBI analysis of the explosive device determined it was a pipe bomb with nails wrapped to its surface to create shrapnel. It was equipped with a timer-armed motion trigger, so that it would explode only when the car was driven. The bomb was confirmed to have been placed on the floorboard directly under the driver&#x27;s seat, not on the floorboard behind the seat, as Agent Doyle had claimed. That evidence suggested that the bomb was an anti-personnel device intended to kill the driver of Bari&#x27;s car. The FBI investigation remained focused on the theory that the explosion was an accidental detonation of a device knowingly transported by Bari. They attempted to match roofing nails transported in Bari&#x27;s car to finishing nails used with the bomb. After seven weeks of news stories reporting the police claims that all evidence pointed to Bari and Cherney, the Alameda County District Attorney announced that he would not file any formal charges against the pair due to insufficient evidence against them. Law enforcement agencies never fully investigated evidence that the bombing was an attempt on Bari&#x27;s life. The crime has remained unsolved.

During her convalescence, Bari issued a directive prohibiting those in her circle from cooperating with investigators. Even after she was no longer considered a suspect, she demanded that her circle remain silent. Bari offered cooperation with investigators in return for legal immunity; but her offer was refused.

Five days after the bombing, on May 29, while Bari was still in hospital, Mike Geniella of the Santa Rosa &quot;Press Democrat&quot; received a letter claiming responsibility for both the bomb in Bari&#x27;s car and a partially detonated one set a week before at the Cloverdale lumber mill. Written in an ornate, biblical style with misogynistic language, the letter was signed &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Avenger.&quot; It said the writer had been outraged by Bari&#x27;s statements and behavior in December 1988, when she opposed an anti-abortion protest at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Ukiah, California. The letter described the construction of the two bombs in great detail.

Based on content of the letter, law enforcement investigated Bill Staley, a self-styled preacher, Louisiana Pacific mill worker, and former professional football player who had been prominent at the 1988 anti-abortion demonstration. Staley was eventually cleared of suspicion in the bombing. While the letter&#x27;s author gave accurate details about the bombs&#x27; construction, investigators found the explanation of how the bomb was placed in Bari&#x27;s car to be implausible. Both supporters and detractors of Bari&#x27;s theory of the bombing being an FBI/industry plot, which had been publicized, concluded that the bomb builder sent the letter in an effort to divert attention to Staley.

====Darryl Cherney====
Investigators looked closely at both Cherney and Bari&#x27;s ex-husband Sweeney as potential suspects, knowing that women often faced danger and were killed by men close to them, especially after relationships ended. Some of Bari&#x27;s friends had noted changes in her relationship with Cherney, and thought he may have set the bomb because Bari had replaced him as the leading organizer of Earth First! in northern California. In a related rumor, there was talk that killing Bari would provide a martyr to boost the profile of Redwood Summer. Suspicions about his writing the Lord&#x27;s Avenger letter, as well as more general grounds, fell apart under logical impossibilities.

====FBI====
The FBI&#x27;s assertion that the bombing was an accidental detonation was shown to be completely implausible in the face of physical evidence. Bari and her supporters began to suspect the assailant was associated with the FBI. Within the next year, Bari developed the theory that the bomber was an acquaintance whom she had suspected of being an FBI informant. From depositions taken in 1994 for Bari and Cherney&#x27;s federal civil rights lawsuit, they learned that the May 24 bombing of Bari&#x27;s car bore a close resemblance to &quot;crime scenes&quot; staged by the FBI in a &quot;bomb school&quot; held in redwood country with the assistance of the Pacific Lumber company earlier that year. Bari and followers believed this supported their idea that the bombing could be attributed to the FBI.

The FBI school was intended to train local and state police officers on how to investigate bomb scenes. The school taught that bomb explosions inside a vehicle often indicated the knowing, criminal transportation of homemade bombs, which went off accidentally. They noted that it was difficult to break into a locked car in order to plant a bomb. By 1991, evidence conclusively showed that the bomb was placed directly beneath Bari&#x27;s seat, as she had said from the day of the accident.

According to Bari, FBI Special Agent Frank Doyle, one of the agents on her case, had been the instructor at the bomb school. At least four of the law enforcement responders to the bombing had been students of his at the school.

In the weeks before the bombing, Bari had received numerous death threats related to her anti-logging activism, which she reported to local police. After the bombing, her attorney turned over such written threats to the FBI for investigation. As revealed in the 2002 trial evidence, neither the Oakland police nor the FBI ever investigated these.

====Bari&#x27;s ex-husband====
In 1991, Stephen Talbot, KQED reporter and documentary producer, and investigative reporter David Helvarg made a documentary titled &quot;Who Bombed Judi Bari?&quot;. During the production, he discovered circumstantial evidence and heard suspicions expressed by acquaintances of Bari that her ex-husband Mike Sweeney should be considered a suspect. Bari told Talbot in confidence that she also had doubts about her former husband, and that he abused her during their marriage. She later publicly denied these statements. Talbot named Sweeney and others as possible suspects in the bombing, but in 1991 did not attribute any statements to Bari. After her death, he felt released from his journalist&#x27;s protection of her as a source. He wrote about Sweeney as a suspect more directly in a 2002 article published on Salon.com.

Bari strongly criticized Talbot&#x27;s 1991 film in her article, &quot;Who bought Steve Talbot?,&quot; published in the &quot;San Francisco Weekly&quot; and the &quot;Anderson Valley Advertiser.&quot; Talbot also had reported a 1989 letter signed by &quot;Argus&quot; that was sent to the Chief of the Ukiah Police Department, offering to be an informant against Bari regarding marijuana dealing. Bari claimed in her article that the &quot;Argus&quot; letter had to have been written by Irv Sutley, a Peace and Freedom Party activist whom she had met in 1988. Attention had also been focused on two other threatening letters: a &quot;no second warning&quot; death threat letter sent to Bari about a month before the bombing, and what became known as the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Avenger&quot; letter sent to the &quot;Santa Rosa Press Democrat&quot; immediately after the bombing.

Through the early 1990s, many activists believed that the bombing was the work of either the FBI or other opponents of Bari&#x27;s Earth First! activities. Irv Sutley was suspected as the hitman. But Bari&#x27;s attempts to shape accounts of the bombing were alienating supporters and raised suspicions that she was hiding something. Bruce Anderson of the &quot;Advertiser&quot; was among those put off by her assertions. He knew that the 1988 divorce had been bitter. While he thought that some of her post-bombing behavior was odd, he continued to support her public position.

As he later recalled:
I still feel guilty about not defending you [Talbot]. I wimped out completely. I knew she&#x27;d told you about Sweeney. Lots of people knew she&#x27;d told you. I was a complete dupe, a coward and a fool. I convinced myself that her work mobilizing people against the corporate timber companies outweighed unpleasant aspects of her character and the even more unpleasant aspects of her personal behavior.

In a reaction to efforts to tie Sutley to the bombing, some former Bari supporters publicly shifted their suspicion toward Sweeney. In 1995 Ed Gehrman, a teacher and publisher of &quot;Flatland&quot;, a small magazine (now defunct) in Fort Bragg, California, had also participated in Redwood Summer protests. He became concerned about the controversy over Sutley. Initially suspecting Sutley, Gehrman questioned him directly about it. Sutley denied being involved. In addition, he said that in 1989, Pam Davis, a friend of Bari, had on three separate occasions offered him $5,000 to kill her ex-husband Sweeney. In response, Bari said in a radio broadcast that the apparent solicitation was a joke misunderstood by her friend, who had conveyed the offer to Sutley.

Gehrman believed that someone was lying. He discussed the issues with journalist Alexander Cockburn of &quot;CounterPunch&quot;, a political magazine. Cockburn offered to pay for polygraph tests of the key players in the controversy. Sutley was the only one who accepted the offer; he took a polygraph test and passed. (Law enforcement does not rely on such polygraph tests.) After that, Gehrman considered Sutley credible. As he considered motives for that attack, he began to suspect Sweeney more strongly.

Gehrman presented his case for exculpating Sutley in &quot;Flatland&quot;. Anderson reconsidered his support of Bari&#x27;s position, arousing anger among her supporters. Anderson was incensed by the possibility that Bari had tried to smear an innocent man in order to promote her narrative that the timber industry and/or the FBI were involved in the bombing. Anderson suggested that Bari and Sweeney each had sufficient guilty knowledge to destroy the other – a legal mutual assured destruction scenario.

Meanwhile, Gehrman tried to use the &quot;Argus,&quot; &quot;no second warning,&quot; and &quot;Lord&#x27;s Avenger&quot; letters to determine the identity of Bari&#x27;s assailant. He submitted facsimiles of the three letters and their envelopes, along with exemplars of text written by various suspects, to Don Foster. An English professor at Vassar College, Foster had established expertise in attributional analysis of documents. (He has since been discounted as an expert.) Foster concluded that the three letters were from the same writer and most closely matched exemplars by Sweeney.

Anderson wrote regular columns in the &quot;Advertiser&quot; accusing the supporters of the late Bari of lying by their continued support of the industry/FBI theory. Gehrman said he was approached in 2005 by Jan Maxwell, a longtime friend of Pam Davis. Maxwell said that Davis had told her that Bari had suggested a murder-for-hire solicitation against Sweeney. This seemed to place the solicitations to Sutley within a larger pattern. Gehrman presented a summary of his knowledge about the case, which he reprinted in the &quot;Advertiser&quot; in 2008.

Years before, in 2002, at the conclusion of the Bari/Cherney civil rights trial, Stephen Talbot had already publicly reported on &quot;Salon.com&quot; that Bari had confided in him about her suspicions of Sweeney and the car bombing, as well as her knowledge that he had firebombed the Santa Rosa airport in 1980. She also said that Sweeney had abused her during their marriage.

===Aftermath===
While the bombing investigation was underway, Earth First! organizers proceeded with training and demonstrations in several timber towns: Fort Bragg (July), Eureka, and Fortuna. Before they got underway, the Mendocino County Board of Supervisors was considering legislation to regulate the size of protest signs and standards, in order to curb violence by demonstrators. Meanwhile, Redwood Summer organizers debated whether to cancel demonstrations in the woods as being too dangerous.

On May 29, representatives of Redwood Summer were pleased to reach an agreement with some of industry: they signed with small local logging companies to support nonviolent and non-destructive protests of timber harvesting. Activists eventually continued events of Redwood Summer, demonstrating in some of the timber towns. The demonstrations by environmentalists were generally countered by demonstrations of numerous loggers and their families. The latter believed that their jobs and lives were jeopardized by proposed restrictions on logging.

Redwood Summer ended with Earth First! claiming success because they had trained so many volunteers in nonviolent resistance. But the numbers of participants in protests were smaller than organizers had hoped for. In addition, by September, the &quot;New York Times&quot; was reporting that antagonism between environmentalists and timber workers seemed to have increased. State voters defeated Proposition 130, which would have restricted logging, on November 6, 1990. The campaign against it had emphasized its support by Earth First!.

Several years later, the Northern California &quot;Timber Wars&quot; heated up again in 1998. Earth First! members were dissatisfied with the final agreement that established the Headwaters Forest Reserve. By a bill passed in 1997, the government was authorized to acquire and protect , rather than the much larger portion proposed for more than a decade. The division between the timber community and Earth First! became sharper than ever. &quot;Anarchists&quot; and other advocates of violence, such as Rodney Coronado, a convicted arsonist and Earth Liberation Front member, gained prominence within Earth First!. Such members threatened both the industrial equipment and facilities of timber companies, as well as individuals at their private residences. After Bari died in 1997, she had the status of a major leader in Earth First! lore, but timber protests moved away from the community-based collaboration that she had tried to develop and present.

===Later events related to bombing investigation===
The bombing of Bari and Cherney has never been solved. Following the 2002 trial and award of damages, Cherney and supporters sought access to the remains of the partially intact Cloverdale mill bomb held by the FBI. Investigators believed that similarities between it and the remains of the pipe bomb in the car showed they were constructed by the same maker. They hoped to find DNA evidence that could be analyzed by current technology and reveal a suspect. In 2012, a federal judge ordered the FBI not to destroy the remains of that pipe bomb, as they had planned. Ben Rosenfeld, attorney for Cherney, requested DNA analysis by an outside lab. The FBI said they had never performed such testing. The judge ordered such testing.

The case remains under the jurisdiction of the City of Oakland, where it occurred, and the Alameda County District Attorney. The Mendocino County Sheriff&#x27;s Office has deferred on jurisdictional issues, claiming that there is insufficient evidence that the bomb was planted in Mendocino County.

In 2001 DNA evidence from documents, including the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Avenger&quot; letter, which is believed strongly tied to Bari&#x27;s assailant and yielded a fingerprint, was presented by joint agreement of the Bari advocates and the FBI. It does not match DNA samples obtained from Sutley. Mike Sweeney reportedly had not submitted a DNA sample. It is not known if law enforcement requested him to submit one.

==Writing and public service career==
Bari became a political writer as part of her interests in feminism, class struggle, and ecology. In May 1992, in an article published in &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, she claimed to have feminized Earth First!. The radical environmentalist group was founded by men. In its early days, they pursued sabotage that damaged equipment and threatened the lives of timber workers, a series of actions known as &quot;monkeywrenching&quot;. Bari emphasized non-violent actions and public education in an effort to build collaboration in the region.

Stepping back from Earth First! leadership because of dealing with inoperable cancer, by the end of 1996, Bari was working as a para-legal and hosting a weekly public radio show. Before her death, she organized the Redwood Summer Justice Project, a non-profit organization to coordinate political and financial support for the suit she and Cherney were conducting.

In 1994 Bari was part of a congressional advisory committee, chartered by Congressman Dan Hamburg (D-CA), trying to develop a proposal for a Headwaters Forest Reserve of 44,000 acres. Efforts had been underway to protect this area for more than a decade. Their proposal included a compensation clause for those lumber workers who would have been laid off following establishment of this extensive reserve. The bill based on the &quot;large reserve&quot; proposal died in Congress after Hamburg lost his 1994 re-election bid; during a midterm upheaval, he was defeated by the Republican former incumbent of his seat. Instead, a 7472-acre forest reserve was authorized by a bill passed on November 14, 1997, shortly after Bari&#x27;s death.

==Death and posthumous civil rights trial==
On March 2, 1997, Bari died of breast cancer at her home near Willits. A memorial service in her honor was attended by an estimated 1,000 people.

Bari and Cherney had filed a federal civil rights suit in 1991 claiming that the FBI and police officers falsely arrested the pair in relation to the bombing of her car in May 1990. They were accused of carrying the bomb to use for other purposes. Bari and Cherney said that law enforcement was trying to frame them as terrorists so as to discredit their political organizing to protect the redwood forests.

In 1997, Bari and Cherney sued the law enforcement officers named in the civil rights suit for conspiracy to violate the activists&#x27; First and Fourth Amendment rights. On October 15 that year, the agents lost their bid for immunity from prosecution.

Also on October 15, federal judge Claudia Wilken dismissed former FBI supervisor SAIC Richard Wallace Held from the case. The court said that as SAIC he had no duty to oversee the daily duties of his subordinate agents. The plaintiffs&#x27; contention that the FBI was responsible for the bomb was also dismissed from the case. Its scope was restricted to malicious investigative malpractice on the part of the FBI, and the allowed damage claim was reduced from $20 million to $4.4 million.

The suit finally went to trial in 2002. After deliberation for two weeks, a jury found in favor of Bari&#x27;s and Cherney&#x27;s federal civil lawsuit. They concluded the pair&#x27;s civil rights had been violated by several named individuals from the FBI and Oakland Police Department.

As part of the jury&#x27;s verdict, the judge ordered Frank Doyle and two other FBI agents, and three Oakland police officers, to pay a total of $4.4 million to Cherney and to Bari&#x27;s estate. The award was compensation for the defendants&#x27; violation of the plaintiffs&#x27; First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and for the defendants&#x27; various unlawful acts, including unlawful search and seizure in violation of the plaintiffs&#x27; Fourth Amendment rights. At trial the FBI and the Oakland Police had pointed fingers at each other:

Oakland investigators testified that they relied almost exclusively on the F.B.I.&#x27;s counter-terrorism unit in San Francisco for advice on how to handle the case. But the F.B.I. agents denied misleading the investigators into believing that Ms. Bari and Mr. Cherney were violence-prone radicals who were probably guilty of transporting the bomb.

While neither agency would admit wrongdoing, the jury held both liable, finding that &quot;[B]oth agencies admitted they had amassed intelligence on the couple before the bombing.&quot; This evidence supported the jury&#x27;s finding that both the FBI and the Oakland police persecuted Bari and Cherney as potential terrorists rather than conducting a full investigation to try to find the perpetrators. They were trying to discredit and sabotage Earth First! and the planned Redwood Summer of 1990, thereby violating the plaintiffs&#x27; First Amendment rights and justifying the large award.

After the trial&#x27;s gag order was lifted, a juror revealed to the press that she believed the law enforcement agents had lied:
&quot;Investigators were lying so much it was insulting . ... I&#x27;m surprised that they seriously expected anyone would believe them ... They were evasive. They were arrogant. They were defensive,&quot; said juror Mary Nunn.

==Legacy==
On May 20, 2003, the Oakland City Council unanimously voted a resolution establishing Judi Bari Day, stating:
Whereas, Judi Bari was a dedicated activist, who worked for many social and environmental causes, the most prominent being the protection and stewardship of California&#x27;s ancient redwood forests. ... Now, therefore, be it resolved that the City of Oakland shall designate May 24 as Judi Bari Day ...

==Renewed controversy==
A critical biography of Bari titled &quot;The Secret Wars of Judi Bari&quot; (2005), by investigative journalist Kate Coleman, drew fierce criticism by many supporters. But a review in &quot;Environmental History&quot; said that the author &quot;succeeds in offering a balanced view of her life.&quot;

Cherney, managers of Bari&#x27;s estate (for her portion of the FBI settlement award), Bari&#x27;s ex-husband Michael Sweeney, a suspect in the bombing; and their followers, claimed the book had hundreds of factual errors and expressed a bias against Bari and Earth First! These critics noted that the publisher, Encounter Books, was founded by arch-conservative Peter Collier. They said it was funded primarily by arch-conservative foundations not sympathetic to Bari&#x27;s causes. Author Coleman said that such allegations and the aspersions cast on the publisher, were being used as a smokescreen. She said the book&#x27;s detractors were dedicated to preserving an incomplete and distorted memory of Ms. Bari.

Cherney and some other critics said that Coleman had failed to include more information from their points of view. The author said that they had not responded to her attempts to contact them.

In her book, Coleman outlined a case that Sweeney, Bari&#x27;s ex-husband, had planted the bomb in order to kill her. This thesis had been suggested by others, namely Stephen Talbot, in his 1991 documentary, and more specifically in his 2002 article on &quot;Salon.com&quot;, in which he revealed statements that Bari had made to him in 1991. He felt her death lifted his responsibility to protect her confidences.

Mark Hertsgaard wrote a critical review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; entitled, &quot;&#x27;Too many rumors, too few facts to examine eco-activism case&quot;. He said, &quot;the reporting is thin and sloppy, and the humdrum prose is marred by dubious speculation.&quot; Ed Guthmann, in a review in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, criticized Hertsgaard&#x27;s review for containing its own errors.

<doc id="56509" wikidata="Q10564271" url="?curid=56509" title="Potash">
<text>Potash ( ) includes various mined and manufactured salts that contain potassium in water-soluble form. The name derives from &quot;pot ash&quot;, plant ashes or wood ash soaked in water in a pot, the primary means of manufacturing potash before the Industrial Era. The word &quot;potassium&quot; is derived from &quot;potash&quot;.

Potash is produced worldwide in amounts exceeding 71.9 million tonnes (~45.4 million tonnes K2O equivalent) per year as of 2021, with Canada being the largest producer, mostly for use in fertilizer. Various kinds of fertilizer-potash constitute the single greatest industrial use of the element potassium in the world. Potassium was first derived in 1807 by electrolysis of caustic potash (potassium hydroxide).

==Terminology==
Potash refers to potassium compounds and potassium-bearing materials, most commonly potassium carbonate. The word &quot;potash&quot; originates from the Middle Dutch , denoting &quot;pot ashes&quot; in 1477.
The old method of making potassium carbonate () was by collecting or producing wood ash (the occupation of ash burners), leaching the ashes, and then evaporating the resulting solution in large iron pots, which left a white residue denominated &quot;pot ash&quot;. Approximately 10% by weight of common wood ash can be recovered as potash. Later, &quot;potash&quot; became widely applied to naturally occurring minerals that contained potassium salts and the commercial product derived from them.

The following table lists a number of potassium compounds that have &quot;potash&quot; in their traditional names:
== History ==

=== Origin of potash ore ===
Most of the world reserves of potassium (K) were deposited as sea water in ancient inland oceans. After the water evaporated, the potassium salts crystallized into beds of potash ore. These are the locations where potash is being mined today. The deposits are a naturally occurring mixture of potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl), more commonly known as table salt. Over time, as the surface of the earth changed, these deposits were covered by thousands of feet of earth.

=== Bronze Age ===
Potash (especially potassium carbonate) has been used in bleaching textiles, making glass, ceramic, and making soap, since the Bronze Age. Potash was principally obtained by leaching the ashes of land plants.

=== 14th–17th century ===

==== Potash mining ====
Beginning in the 14th century potash was mined in Ethiopia. One of the world&#x27;s largest deposits, 140 to 150 million tons, is located in the Dallol area of the Afar Region.

==== Wood-derived potash ====
Potash was one of the most important industrial chemicals. It was refined from the ashes of broadleaved trees and produced primarily in the forested areas of Europe, Russia, and North America. Although methods for producing artificial alkalis were invented in the late 18th century, these did not become economical until the late 19th century and so the dependence on organic sources of potash remained.

Potash became an important international trade commodity in Europe from at least the early 14th century. It is estimated that European imports of potash required 6 or more million cubic metres each year from the early 17th century. Between 1420 and 1620, the primary exporting cities for wood-derived potash were Gdańsk, Königsberg and Riga. In the late 15th century, London was the lead importer due to its position as the centre of soft soap making while the Dutch dominated as suppliers and consumers in the 16th century. From the 1640s, geopolitical disruptions (i.e. Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)) meant that the centres of export moved from the Baltic to Archangelsk, Russia. In 1700, Russian ash was dominant though Gdańsk remained notable for the quality of its potash.

=== 18th century ===

==== Kelp ash ====
On the Orkney islands, kelp ash provided potash and soda ash, production starting &quot;possibly as early as 1719&quot; and lasting for a century. The products were &quot;eagerly sought after by the glass and soap industries of the time.&quot;

==== North America ====
By the 18th century, higher quality American potash was increasingly exported to Britain. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, potash production provided settlers in North America badly needed cash and credit as they cleared wooded land for crops. To make full use of their land, settlers needed to dispose of excess wood. The easiest way to accomplish this was to burn any wood not needed for fuel or construction. Ashes from hardwood trees could then be used to make lye, which could either be used to make soap or boiled down to produce valuable potash. Hardwood could generate ashes at the rate of 60 to 100 bushels per acre (500 to 900 m3/km2). In 1790, the sale of ashes could generate $3.25 to $6.25 per acre ($800 to $1,500/km2) in rural New York State – nearly the same rate as hiring a laborer to clear the same area. Potash making became a major industry in British North America. Great Britain was always the most important market. The American potash industry followed the woodsman&#x27;s ax across the country.

====The first US patent====
The first US patent of any kind was issued in 1790 to Samuel Hopkins for an improvement &quot;in the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new Apparatus and Process&quot;. &quot;Pearl ash&quot; was a purer quality made by calcination of potash in a reverberatory furnace or kiln. Potash pits were once used in England to produce potash that was used in making soap for the preparation of wool for yarn production.

=== 19th century ===
After about 1820, New York replaced New England as the most important source; by 1840 the center was in Ohio. Potash production was always a by-product industry, following from the need to clear land for agriculture.

==== Canada ====
From 1767, potash from wood ashes was exported from Canada. By 1811, 70% of the total 19.6 million lbs of potash imports to Britain came from Canada. Exports of potash and pearl ash reached 43,958 barrels in 1865. There were 519 asheries in operation in 1871.

=== 20th century industrialization ===

The wood-ash industry declined in the late 19th century when large-scale production of potash from mineral salts was established in Germany. In the early 20th century, the potash industry was dominated by a cartel in which Germany had the dominant role. WWI saw a brief resurgence of American asheries, with their product typically consisting of 66% hydroxide, 17% carbonate, 16% sulfate and other impurities. Later in the century, the cartel ended as new potash producers emerged in the USSR and Canada.

In 1943, potash was discovered in Saskatchewan, Canada, during oil drilling. Active exploration began in 1951. In 1958, the Potash Company of America became the first potash producer in Canada with the commissioning of an underground potash mine at Patience Lake. As numerous potash producers in Canada developed, the Saskatchewan government became increasingly involved in the industry, leading to the creation of Canpotex in the 1970s. 
In 1964 the Canadian company Kalium Chemicals established the first potash mine using the solution process. The discovery was made during oil reserve exploration. The mine was developed near Regina, Saskatchewan. The mine reached depths greater than 1500 meters. It is now the Mosaic Corporation&#x27;s Belle Plaine unit.

The USSR&#x27;s potash production had largely been for domestic use and use in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance countries. After the dissolution of the USSR, Russian and Belarusian potash producers entered into direct competition with producers elsewhere in the world for the first time.

In the beginning of the 20th century, potash deposits were found in the Dallol Depression in the Musely and Crescent localities near the Ethiopean-Eritrean border. The estimated reserves in Musely and Crescent are 173 and 12 million tonnes respectively. The latter is particularly suitable for surface mining. It was explored in the 1960s but the works stopped due to flooding in 1967. Attempts to continue mining in the 1990s were halted by the Eritrean–Ethiopian War and have not resumed as of 2009.

== Mining ==

=== Shaft mining and strip mining ===
All commercial potash deposits come originally from evaporite deposits and are often buried deep below the earth&#x27;s surface. Potash ores are typically rich in potassium chloride (KCl), sodium chloride (NaCl) and other salts and clays, and are typically obtained by conventional shaft mining with the extracted ore ground into a powder. Most potash mines today are deep shaft mines as much as 4,400 feet (1,400 m) underground. Others are mined as strip mines, having been laid down in horizontal layers as sedimentary rock. In above-ground processing plants, the KCl is separated from the mixture to produce a high-analysis potassium fertilizer. Other potassium salts can be separated by various procedures, resulting in potassium sulfate and potassium-magnesium sulfate.

=== Dissolution mining and evaporation methods ===
Other methods include dissolution mining and evaporation methods from brines. In the evaporation method, hot water is injected into the potash, which is dissolved and then pumped to the surface where it is concentrated by solar induced evaporation. Amine reagents are then added to either the mined or evaporated solutions. The amine coats the KCl but not NaCl. Air bubbles cling to the amine + KCl and float it to the surface while the NaCl and clay sink to the bottom. The surface is skimmed for the amine + KCl, which is then dried and packaged for use as a K rich fertilizer—KCl dissolves readily in water and is available quickly for plant nutrition.

Recovery of potassium fertilizer salts from sea water has been studied in India. During extraction of salt from seawater by evaporation, potassium salts get concentrated in bittern, an effluent from the salt industry.

== Production ==
Potash deposits are distributed unevenly throughout the world. , deposits are being mined in Canada, Russia, China, Belarus, Israel, Germany, Chile, the United States, Jordan, Spain, the United Kingdom, Uzbekistan and Brazil, with the most significant deposits present under the great depths of the Prairie Evaporite Formation in Saskatchewan, Canada. Canada and Russia are the countries where the bulk of potash is produced; Belarus is also a major producer.

The Permian Basin deposit includes the major mines outside of Carlsbad, New Mexico, to the world&#x27;s purest potash deposit in Lea County, New Mexico (near the Carlsbad deposits), which is believed to be roughly 80% pure. (Osceola County, Michigan, has deposits 90+% pure; the only mine there was converted to salt production, however.) Canada is the largest producer, followed by Russia and Belarus. The most significant reserve of Canada&#x27;s potash is located in the province of Saskatchewan and is mined by The Mosaic Company, Nutrien and K+S.

In China, most potash deposits are concentrated in the deserts and salt flats of the endorheic basins of its western provinces, particularly Qinghai. Geological expeditions discovered the reserves in the 1950s but commercial exploitation lagged until Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s Reform and Opening Up Policy in the 1980s. The 1989 opening of the Qinghai Potash Fertilizer Factory in the remote Qarhan Playa increased China&#x27;s production of potassium chloride sixfold, from less than a year at Haixi and Tanggu to just under a year.

In 2013, almost 70% of potash production was controlled by Canpotex, an exporting and marketing firm, and the Belarusian Potash Company. The latter was a joint venture between Belaruskali and Uralkali, but on July 30, 2013, Uralkali announced that it had ended the venture.

Potash is water soluble and transporting it requires special transportation infrastructure. 
==Occupational hazards==
Excessive respiratory disease due to environmental hazards, such as radon and asbestos, has been a concern for potash miners throughout history. Potash miners are liable to develop silicosis. Based on a study conducted between 1977 and 1987 of cardiovascular disease among potash workers, the overall mortality rates were low, but a noticeable difference in above-ground workers was documented.

==Consumption==
===Fertilizers===
Potassium is the third major plant and crop nutrient after nitrogen and phosphorus. It has been used since antiquity as a soil fertilizer (about 90% of current use). Fertilizer use is the main driver behind potash consumption, especially for its use in fertilizing crops that contribute to high-protein diets. As of at least 2010, more than 95% of potash is mined for use in agricultural purposes.

Elemental potassium does not occur in nature because it reacts violently with water. As part of various compounds, potassium makes up about 2.6% of the Earth&#x27;s crust by mass and is the seventh most abundant element, similar in abundance to sodium at approximately 1.8% of the crust. Potash is important for agriculture because it improves water retention, yield, nutrient value, taste, color, texture and disease resistance of food crops. It has wide application to fruit and vegetables, rice, wheat and other grains, sugar, corn, soybeans, palm oil and cotton, all of which benefit from the nutrient&#x27;s quality-enhancing properties.

Demand for food and animal feed has been on the rise since 2000. The United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Economic Research Service (ERS) attributes the trend to average annual population increases of 75 million people around the world. Geographically, economic growth in Asia and Latin America greatly contributed to the increased use of potash-based fertilizer. Rising incomes in developing countries also were a factor in the growing potash and fertilizer use. With more money in the household budget, consumers added more meat and dairy products to their diets. This shift in eating patterns required more acres to be planted, more fertilizer to be applied and more animals to be fed—all requiring more potash.

After years of trending upward, fertilizer use slowed in 2008. The worldwide economic downturn is the primary reason for the declining fertilizer use, dropping prices, and mounting inventories.

The world&#x27;s largest consumers of potash are China, the United States, Brazil, and India. Brazil imports 90% of the potash it needs. Potash consumption for fertilizers is expected to increase to about 37.8 million tonnes by 2022.

Potash imports and exports are often reported in K2O &quot;equivalent&quot;, although fertilizer never contains potassium oxide, per se, because potassium oxide is caustic and hygroscopic.

===Pricing===
At the beginning of 2008, potash prices started a meteoric climb from less than US$200 a tonne to a high of US$875 in February 2009. These subsequently dropped dramatically to an April 2010 low of US$310 level, before recovering in 2011–12, and relapsing again in 2013. For reference, prices in November 2011 were about US$470 per tonne, but as of May 2013 were stable at US$393. After the surprise breakup of the world&#x27;s largest potash cartel at the end of July 2013, potash prices were poised to drop some 20 percent. At the end of December 2015, potash traded for US$295 a tonne. In April 2016 its price was US$269. In May 2017, prices had stabilised at around US$216 a tonne down 18% from the previous year. By January 2018, prices have been recovering to around US$225 a tonne. World potash demand tends to be price inelastic in the short-run and even in the long run.

===Other uses===
In addition to its use as a fertilizer, potassium chloride is important in many industrialized economies, where it is used in aluminium recycling, by the chloralkali industry to produce potassium hydroxide, in metal electroplating, oil-well drilling fluid, snow and ice melting, steel heat-treating, in medicine as a treatment for hypokalemia, and water softening. Potassium hydroxide is used for industrial water treatment and is the precursor of potassium carbonate, several forms of potassium phosphate, many other potassic chemicals, and soap manufacturing. Potassium carbonate is used to produce animal feed supplements, cement, fire extinguishers, food products, photographic chemicals, and textiles. It is also used in brewing beer, pharmaceutical preparations, and as a catalyst for synthetic rubber manufacturing. Also combined with silica sand to produce potassium silicate, sometimes known as waterglass, for use in paints and arc welding electrodes. These non-fertilizer uses have accounted for about 15% of annual potash consumption in the United States.

=== Substitutes ===
No substitutes exist for potassium as an essential plant nutrient and as an essential nutritional requirement for animals and humans. Manure and glauconite (greensand) are low-potassium-content sources that can be profitably transported only short distances to crop fields.

<text>Angiopathy is the generic term for a disease of the blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries). This also refers to the condition of damage or rupture of small blood vessels. The best known and most prevalent angiopathy is [[diabetic angiopathy]], a common complication of chronic diabetes.

==Classification==

===By caliber===
There are two types of angiopathy: macroangiopathy and microangiopathy.

In macroangiopathy, atherosclerosis and a resultant blood clot forms on the large blood vessels, sticks to the vessel walls, and blocks the flow of blood. Macroangiopathy in the heart is coronary artery disease; in the brain, it is cerebrovascular disease. Macroangiopathy may cause other complications, such as ischemic heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease which contributes to the diabetic foot ulcers and the risk of amputation.

In microangiopathy, the walls of the smaller blood vessels become so thick and weak that they bleed, leak protein, and slow the flow of blood through the body. The decrease of blood flow through stenosis or clot formation impairs the flow of oxygen to cells and biological tissues (called ischemia) and leads to cellular death (necrosis and gangrene, which in turn may require amputation). Thus, tissues which are very sensitive to oxygen levels, such as the retina, develop microangiopathy and may cause blindness (so-called proliferative diabetic retinopathy). Damage to nerve cells may cause peripheral neuropathy, and to kidney cells, diabetic kidney disease (Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome).

===By condition===
It is also possible to classify angiopathy by the associated condition:
* Diabetic angiopathy
* Cerebral amyloid angiopathy

Chronic diabetes can lead to several problems, one of which is Diabetic Angiopathy. Individuals with diabetic angiopathy notice a constriction in their arteries. This cause many organs to receive insufficient blood and oxygen, which might eventually cause harm. High blood sugar is the primary cause of diabetic angiopathy. Excessive blood sugar levels have the potential to harm tissues and cells.

A form of cerebrovascular illness known as Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) is typified by the buildup of amyloid beta-peptide in the leptomeninges and small to medium sized cerebral blood vessels. Amyloid buildup causes brittle blood vessels, which can lead to lobar intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH). In addition, hemosiderosis, inflammatory leukoencephalopathy, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, accidental microbleeds, cognitive deficits, and transitory neurological symptoms may manifest.

==Causes==
The cause of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy are unknown. Sometimes it can be hereditary, however, there have been cases where it is developed in the elderly, especially in people over 55 years of age.

High blood sugar is the primary cause of diabetic angiopathy. The endothelium, a smooth layer of the cell wall, is weakened and the artery-lining cells are injured. Rough patches develop along the endothelium and may promote the accumulation of deposits known as plaque. These deposits gradually harden and become more noticeable over time, restricting (stenosing) the artery and impairing normal blood flow. Different organs receive insufficient oxygen-rich blood due to the bottleneck that was formed. 

==Symptoms==
Individuals with cerebral amyloid angiopathy typically have no symptoms. However, spontaneous lobar bleeding is the most frequent clinical sign when symptomatic. The clinical impairments are primarily determined by the site and extent of the bleeding. Larger hemorrhages may result in greater focused deficits, headaches, seizures, speaking difficulties, and muscular weakness. Smaller hemorrhages may produce hemiplegia and diminished consciousness. 
==Treatment==
Currently, while there is no cure for angiopathy, there are ways through which the symptoms can be managed. For example, therapies. Treatment options for situations of muscle weakness may include speech, occupational, or physical therapy. Medication can be used for potential seizures and memory loss.

lobar intracerebral hemorrhages(ICH) linked to CAA is often recurring. Due to this high prevalence, when there isn&#x27;t a clear justification for anticoagulation, doctors usually avoid antiplatelet medicines and anticoagulants. Notably, research has shown that people with atrial fibrillation benefit from restarting anticoagulation.

Despite the fact that CAA does not appear to be primarily caused by hypertension, blood pressure reduction has also been linked to advantages in terms of mortality.[8] Blood pressure control reduced the risk of CAA-related ICH by 77%. 

Finally, a small body of research has demonstrated the advantages of using immunosuppression to treat the inflammatory forms of CAA.

<text>Kidney dialysis is the process of removing excess water, solutes, and toxins from the blood in people whose kidneys can no longer perform these functions naturally. Along with kidney transplantation, it is a type of renal replacement therapy.

Dialysis may need to be initiated when there is a sudden rapid loss of kidney function, known as acute kidney injury (previously called acute renal failure), or when a gradual decline in kidney function, chronic kidney failure, reaches stage 5. Stage 5 chronic renal failure is reached when the glomerular filtration rate is less than 15% of the normal, creatinine clearance is less than 10 mL per minute, and uremia is present.

Dialysis is used as a temporary measure in either acute kidney injury or in those awaiting kidney transplant and as a permanent measure in those for whom a transplant is not indicated or not possible.

In West European countries, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, dialysis is paid for by the government for those who are eligible. The first successful dialysis was performed in 1943.

==Background==

The kidneys have an important role in maintaining health. When the person is healthy, the kidneys maintain the body&#x27;s internal equilibrium of water and minerals (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sulphate). The acidic metabolism end-products that the body cannot get rid of via respiration are also excreted through the kidneys. The kidneys also function as a part of the endocrine system, producing erythropoietin, calcitriol and renin. Erythropoietin is involved in the production of red blood cells and calcitriol plays a role in bone formation. Dialysis is an imperfect treatment to replace kidney function because it does not correct the compromised endocrine functions of the kidney. Dialysis treatments replace some of these functions through diffusion (waste removal) and ultrafiltration (fluid removal). Dialysis uses highly purified (also known as &quot;ultrapure&quot;) water.

==Principle==
Dialysis works on the principles of the diffusion of solutes and ultrafiltration of fluid across a semipermeable membrane. Diffusion is a property of substances in water; substances in water tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Blood flows by one side of a semipermeable membrane, and a dialysate, or special dialysis fluid, flows by the opposite side. A semipermeable membrane is a thin layer of material that contains holes of various sizes, or pores. Smaller solutes and fluid pass through the membrane, but the membrane blocks the passage of larger substances (for example, red blood cells and large proteins). This replicates the filtering process that takes place in the kidneys when the blood enters the kidneys and the larger substances are separated from the smaller ones in the glomerulus.

The two main types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, remove wastes and excess water from the blood in different ways. Hemodialysis removes wastes and water by circulating blood outside the body through an external filter, called a dialyzer, that contains a semipermeable membrane. The blood flows in one direction and the dialysate flows in the opposite. The counter-current flow of the blood and dialysate maximizes the concentration gradient of solutes between the blood and dialysate, which helps to remove more urea and creatinine from the blood. The concentrations of solutes normally found in the urine (for example potassium, phosphorus and urea) are undesirably high in the blood, but low or absent in the dialysis solution, and constant replacement of the dialysate ensures that the concentration of undesired solutes is kept low on this side of the membrane. The dialysis solution has levels of minerals like potassium and calcium that are similar to their natural concentration in healthy blood. For another solute, bicarbonate, dialysis solution level is set at a slightly higher level than in normal blood, to encourage the diffusion of bicarbonate into the blood, to act as a pH buffer to neutralize the metabolic acidosis that is often present in these patients. The levels of the components of dialysate are typically prescribed by a nephrologist according to the needs of the individual patient.

In peritoneal dialysis, wastes and water are removed from the blood inside the body using the peritoneum as a natural semipermeable membrane. Waste and excess water move from the blood, across the visceral peritoneum due to its large surface area and into a special dialysis solution, called dialysate, in the peritoneal cavity within the abdomen.

==Types==
There are three primary and two secondary types of dialysis: hemodialysis (primary), peritoneal dialysis (primary), hemofiltration (primary), hemodiafiltration (secondary) and intestinal dialysis (secondary).

===Hemodialysis===

In hemodialysis, the patient&#x27;s blood is pumped through the blood compartment of a dialyzer, exposing it to a partially permeable membrane. The dialyzer is composed of thousands of tiny hollow synthetic fibers. The fiber wall acts as the semipermeable membrane. Blood flows through the fibers, dialysis solution flows around the outside of the fibers, and water and wastes move between these two solutions. The cleansed blood is then returned via the circuit back to the body. Ultrafiltration occurs by increasing the hydrostatic pressure across the dialyzer membrane. This usually is done by applying a negative pressure to the dialysate compartment of the dialyzer. This pressure gradient causes water and dissolved solutes to move from blood to dialysate and allows the removal of several litres of excess fluid during a typical 4-hour treatment.
In the United States, hemodialysis treatments are typically given in a dialysis center three times per week (due in the United States to Medicare reimbursement rules); however, as of 2005 over 2,500 people in the United States are dialyzing at home more frequently for various treatment lengths. Studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of dialyzing 5 to 7 times a week, for 6 to 8 hours. This type of hemodialysis is usually called &quot;nocturnal daily hemodialysis&quot; and a study has shown it provides a significant improvement in both small and large molecular weight clearance and decreases the need for phosphate binders. These frequent long treatments are often done at home while sleeping, but home dialysis is a flexible modality and schedules can be changed day to day, week to week. In general, studies show that both increased treatment length and frequency are clinically beneficial.

Hemo-dialysis was one of the most common procedures performed in U.S. hospitals in 2011, occurring in 909,000 stays (a rate of 29 stays per 10,000 population).
===Peritoneal dialysis===
In peritoneal dialysis, a sterile solution containing glucose (called dialysate) is run through a tube into the peritoneal cavity, the abdominal body cavity around the intestine, where the peritoneal membrane acts as a partially permeable membrane.

This exchange is repeated 4–5 times per day; automatic systems can run more frequent exchange cycles overnight. Peritoneal dialysis is less efficient than hemodialysis, but because it is carried out for a longer period of time the net effect in terms of removal of waste products and of salt and water are similar to hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis is carried out at home by the patient, often without help. This frees patients from the routine of having to go to a dialysis clinic on a fixed schedule multiple times per week. Peritoneal dialysis can be performed with little to no specialized equipment (other than bags of fresh dialysate).
===Hemofiltration===
Hemofiltration is a similar treatment to hemodialysis, but it makes use of a different principle. The blood is pumped through a dialyzer or &quot;hemofilter&quot; as in dialysis, but no dialysate is used. A pressure gradient is applied; as a result, water moves across the very permeable membrane rapidly, &quot;dragging&quot; along with it many dissolved substances, including ones with large molecular weights, which are not cleared as well by hemodialysis. Salts and water lost from the blood during this process are replaced with a &quot;substitution fluid&quot; that is infused into the extracorporeal circuit during the treatment.

===Hemodiafiltration===
Hemodiafiltration is a combination between hemodialysis and hemofiltration, thus used to purify the blood from toxins when the kidney is not working normally and also used to treat acute kidney injury (AKI).

===Intestinal dialysis===

In intestinal dialysis, the diet is supplemented with soluble fibres such as acacia fibre, which is digested by bacteria in the colon. This bacterial growth increases the amount of nitrogen that is eliminated in fecal waste. An alternative approach utilizes the ingestion of 1 to 1.5 liters of non-absorbable solutions of polyethylene glycol or mannitol every fourth hour.

==Indications==
The decision to initiate dialysis or hemofiltration in patients with kidney failure depends on several factors. These can be divided into acute or chronic indications.

Depression and kidney failure symptoms can be similar to each other. It is important that there is open communication between a dialysis team and the patient. Open communication will allow giving a better quality of life. Knowing the patients&#x27; needs will allow the dialysis team to provide more options like: changes in dialysis type like home dialysis for patients to be able to be more active or changes in eating habits to avoid unnecessary waste products.

===Acute indications===
Indications for dialysis in a patient with acute kidney injury are summarized with the vowel mnemonic of &quot;AEIOU&quot;:
# Acidemia from metabolic acidosis in situations in which correction with sodium bicarbonate is impractical or may result in fluid overload.
# Electrolyte abnormality, such as severe hyperkalemia, especially when combined with AKI.
# Intoxication, that is, acute poisoning with a dialyzable substance. These substances can be represented by the mnemonic SLIME: salicylic acid, lithium, isopropanol, magnesium-containing laxatives and ethylene glycol.
# Overload of fluid not expected to respond to treatment with diuretics
# Uremia complications, such as pericarditis, encephalopathy, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

===Chronic indications===
Chronic dialysis may be indicated when a patient has symptomatic kidney failure and low glomerular filtration rate (GFR &lt; 15 mL/min). Between 1996 and 2008, there was a trend to initiate dialysis at progressively higher estimated GFR, eGFR.
A review of the evidence shows no benefit or potential harm with early dialysis initiation, which has been defined by start of dialysis at an estimated GFR of greater than 10 ml/min/1.732. Observational data from large registries of dialysis patients suggests that early start of dialysis may be harmful.
The most recent published guidelines from Canada, for when to initiate dialysis, recommend an intent to defer dialysis until a patient has definite kidney failure symptoms, which may occur at an estimated GFR of 5–9 ml/min/1.732.

==Impact==

=== Effectiveness ===
Even though it is not a cure for kidney failure, dialysis is a very effective treatment. Survival rates of kidney failure are generally longer with dialysis than without (having only conservative kidney management). However, from the age of 80 and in elderly patients with comorbidities there is no difference in survival between the two groups.

=== Quality of life ===
Dialysis is an intensive treatment that has a serious impact on those treated with it. Being on dialysis usually leads to a poor quality of life. However, there are strategies that can make it more tolerable. Receiving dialysis at home might improve people&#x27;s quality of life and autonomy.

=== Scheduling and adherence ===
Dialysis is typically on a regular schedule of three times a week.

Given that dialysis patients have little or no capacity to filtrate solutes and regulate their fluid volume due to kidney dysfunction, missing dialysis is potentially lethal. These patients can be hyperkalaemic leading to cardiac dysrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest, as well as fluid in the alveoli of their lungs which can impair breathing.

Some medications can be used in the short term to decrease serum potassium and stabilise the cardiac muscle so as to facilitate stabilisation of acute patients in the setting of missed dialysis. Salbutamol and insulin can decrease serum potassium by up to 1.0mmol/L each by shifting potassium from the extracellular space into the intracellular spaces within skeletal muscle cells, and calcium gluconate is used to stabilise the myocardium in hyperkalaemic patients, in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of lethal arrhythmias arising from a high serum potassium.

=== Survival without dialysis ===
People who decide against dialysis treatment when reaching end-stage chronic kidney disease could survive several years and experience improvements in their mental well-being in addition to sustained physical well-being and overall quality of life until late in their illness course. However, use of acute care services in these cases is common and intensity of end-of-life care is highly variable among people opting out of dialysis.

===Cost===
The average annual total cost per dialysis patient varies between countries, for example in South Korea 19,812 USD, in New Zealand 26,479 USD and in Netherlands 89,958 USD, according to an 2021 article.

==Pediatric dialysis==
Over the past 20 years, children have benefited from major improvements in both technology and clinical management of dialysis. Morbidity during dialysis sessions has decreased with seizures being exceptional and hypotensive episodes rare. Pain and discomfort have been reduced with the use of chronic internal jugular venous catheters and anesthetic creams for fistula puncture. Non-invasive technologies to assess patient target dry weight and access flow can significantly reduce patient morbidity and health care costs. Mortality in paediatric and young adult patients on chronic hemodialysis is associated with multifactorial markers of nutrition, inflammation, anaemia and dialysis dose, which highlights the importance of multimodal intervention strategies besides adequate hemodialysis treatment as determined by Kt/V alone.

Biocompatible synthetic membranes, specific small size material dialyzers and new low extra-corporeal volume tubing have been developed for young infants. Arterial and venous tubing length is made of minimum length and diameter, a &lt;80 ml to &lt;110 ml volume tubing is designed for pediatric patients and a &gt;130 to &lt;224 ml tubing are for adult patients, regardless of blood pump segment size, which can be of 6.4 mm for normal dialysis or 8.0mm for high flux dialysis in all patients. All dialysis machine manufacturers design their machine to do the pediatric dialysis. In pediatric patients, the pump speed should be kept at low side, according to patient blood output capacity, and the clotting with heparin dose should be carefully monitored. The high flux dialysis (see below) is not recommended for pediatric patients.

In children, hemodialysis must be individualized and viewed as an &quot;integrated therapy&quot; that considers their long-term exposure to chronic renal failure treatment. Dialysis is seen only as a temporary measure for children compared with renal transplantation because this enables the best chance of rehabilitation in terms of educational and psychosocial functioning. Long-term chronic dialysis, however, the highest standards should be applied to these children to preserve their future &quot;cardiovascular life&quot;—which might include more dialysis time and on-line hemodiafiltration online hdf with synthetic high flux membranes with the surface area of 0.2 m2 to 0.8 m2 and blood tubing lines with the low volume yet large blood pump segment of 6.4/8.0 mm, if we are able to improve on the rather restricted concept of small-solute urea dialysis clearance.

==Dialysis in different countries==

===United Kingdom===
The National Health Service provides dialysis in the United Kingdom. In 2022, there were more than 30,000 people on dialysis in the UK.

For people who need to travel to dialysis centres, patient transport services are generally provided without charge. Cornwall Clinical Commissioning Group proposed to restrict this provision to people who did not have specific medical or financial reasons in 2018 but changed their minds after a campaign led by Kidney Care UK and decided to fund transport for people requiring dialysis three times a week for a minimum or six times a month for a minimum of three months.

==== Home dialysis ====
UK clinical guidelines recommend offering people a choice regarding where they get their dialysis. Research in the UK found that receiving dialysis at home can lead to better quality of life and is less costly than receiving dialysis in hospital. However, many people in the UK prefer to receive dialysis in hospital: In 2022, only 1 in 6 chose receiving it at home.

There are various reasons why people do not choose home dialysis. Among these are preferring hospitals as a way of getting regular social contact, being concerned about necessary changes to their homes and their family members becoming carers. Other reasons include a lack of motivation, doubting abilities for self-managed treatment, and not having suitable housing or support at home. Hospital dialysis is also often presented as the norm by healthcare professionals.

Encouraging people to have dialysis at home could reduce the impact of dialysis on people&#x27;s social and professional lives. Some ways to help are offering peer support from other people on home dialysis, better education materials, and professionals being more familiar with home dialysis and its impact. Choosing home dialysis is more likely at kidney centers which have better organisational culture, leadership and attitude.

=== United States ===
Since 1972, insurance companies in the United States have covered the cost of dialysis and transplants for all citizens. By 2014, more than 460,000 Americans were undergoing treatment, the costs of which amount to six percent of the entire Medicare budget. Kidney disease is the ninth leading cause of death, and the U.S. has one of the highest mortality rates for dialysis care in the industrialized world. The rate of patients getting kidney transplants has been lower than expected. These outcomes have been blamed on a new for-profit dialysis industry responding to government payment policies. A 1999 study concluded that &quot;patients treated in for-profit dialysis facilities have higher mortality rates and are less likely to be placed on the waiting list for a renal transplant than are patients who are treated in not-for-profit facilities&quot;, possibly because transplantation removes a constant stream of revenue from the facility. The insurance industry has complained about kickbacks and problematic relationships between charities and providers.

=== China ===
The Government of China provides the funding for dialysis treatment. There is a challenge to reach everyone who needs dialysis treatment because of the unequal distribution of health care resources and dialysis centers. There are 395,121 individuals who receive hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in China per year. The percentage of the Chinese population with Chronic Kidney Disease is 10.8%. The Chinese Government is trying to increase the amount of peritoneal dialysis taking place to meet the needs of the nation&#x27;s individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease.

=== Australia ===
Dialysis is provided without cost to all patients through Medicare, with 75% of all dialysis being administered as haemodialysis to patients three times per week in a dialysis facility. The Northern Territory has the highest incidence rate per population of haemodialysis, with Indigenous Australians having higher rates of Chronic Kidney Disease and lower rates of functional kidney transplants than the broader population. The remote Central Australian town of Alice Springs, despite having a population of approximately 25000, has the largest dialysis unit in the Southern Hemisphere. Many people must move to Alice Springs from remote Indigenous communities to access health services such as haemodialysis, which results in housing shortages, overcrowding, and poor living conditions.

==History==

In 1913, Leonard Rowntree and John Jacob Abel of Johns Hopkins Hospital developed the first dialysis system which they successfully tested in animals. A Dutch doctor, Willem Johan Kolff, constructed the first working dialyzer in 1943 during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Due to the scarcity of available resources, Kolff had to improvise and build the initial machine using sausage casings, beverage cans, a washing machine and various other items that were available at the time. Over the following two years (1944–1945), Kolff used his machine to treat 16 patients with acute kidney failure, but the results were unsuccessful. Then, in 1945, a 67-year-old comatose woman regained consciousness following 11 hours of hemodialysis with the dialyzer and lived for another seven years before dying from an unrelated condition. She was the first-ever patient successfully treated with dialysis. Gordon Murray of the University of Toronto independently developed a dialysis machine in 1945. Unlike Kolff&#x27;s rotating drum, Murray&#x27;s machine used fixed flat plates, more like modern designs. Like Kolff, Murray&#x27;s initial success was in patients with acute renal failure. Nils Alwall of Lund University in Sweden modified a similar construction to the Kolff dialysis machine by enclosing it inside a stainless steel canister. This allowed the removal of fluids, by applying a negative pressure to the outside canister, thus making it the first truly practical device for hemodialysis. Alwall treated his first patient in acute kidney failure on 3 September 1946.

<text>A capillary is a small blood vessel, from 5 to 10 micrometres in diameter, and is part of the microcirculation system. Capillaries are microvessels and the smallest blood vessels in the body. They are composed of only the tunica intima (the innermost layer of an artery or vein), consisting of a thin wall of simple squamous endothelial cells. They are the site of the exchange of many substances from the surrounding interstitial fluid, and they convey blood from the smallest branches of the arteries (arterioles) to those of the veins (venules). Other substances which cross capillaries include water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, urea, glucose, uric acid, lactic acid and creatinine. Lymph capillaries connect with larger lymph vessels to drain lymphatic fluid collected in microcirculation.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Capillary&quot; comes from the Latin word , meaning &quot;of or resembling hair&quot;, with use in English beginning in the mid-17th century. The meaning stems from the tiny, hairlike diameter of a capillary. While capillary is usually used as a noun, the word also is used as an adjective, as in &quot;capillary action&quot;, in which a liquid flows without influence of external forces, such as gravity.

== Structure ==
Blood flows from the heart through arteries, which branch and narrow into arterioles, and then branch further into capillaries where nutrients and wastes are exchanged. The capillaries then join and widen to become venules, which in turn widen and converge to become veins, which then return blood back to the heart through the venae cavae. In the mesentery, metarterioles form an additional stage between arterioles and capillaries.

Individual capillaries are part of the capillary bed, an interweaving network of capillaries supplying tissues and organs. The more metabolically active a tissue is, the more capillaries are required to supply nutrients and carry away products of metabolism. There are two types of capillaries: true capillaries, which branch from arterioles and provide exchange between tissue and the capillary blood, and sinusoids, a type of open-pore capillary found in the liver, bone marrow, anterior pituitary gland, and brain circumventricular organs. Capillaries and sinusoids are short vessels that directly connect the arterioles and venules at opposite ends of the beds. Metarterioles are found primarily in the mesenteric microcirculation.

Lymphatic capillaries are slightly larger in diameter than blood capillaries, and have closed ends (unlike the blood capillaries open at one end to the arterioles and open at the other end to the venules). This structure permits interstitial fluid to flow into them but not out. Lymph capillaries have a greater internal oncotic pressure than blood capillaries, due to the greater concentration of plasma proteins in the lymph.

=== Types ===
Blood capillaries are categorized into three types: continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoidal (also known as discontinuous).

==== Continuous ====
Continuous capillaries are continuous in the sense that the endothelial cells provide an uninterrupted lining, and they only allow smaller molecules, such as water and ions, to pass through their intercellular clefts. Lipid-soluble molecules can passively diffuse through the endothelial cell membranes along concentration gradients. Continuous capillaries can be further divided into two subtypes:
:# Those with numerous transport vesicles, which are found primarily in skeletal muscles, fingers, gonads, and skin.
:# Those with few vesicles, which are primarily found in the central nervous system. These capillaries are a constituent of the blood–brain barrier.

==== Fenestrated ====
Fenestrated capillaries have pores known as &quot;fenestrae&quot; (Latin for &quot;windows&quot;) in the endothelial cells that are 60–80 nanometres (nm) in diameter. They are spanned by a diaphragm of radially oriented fibrils that allows small molecules and limited amounts of protein to diffuse. In the renal glomerulus the capillaries are wrapped in podocyte foot processes or pedicels, which have slit pores with a function analogous to the diaphragm of the capillaries. Both of these types of blood vessels have continuous basal laminae and are primarily located in the endocrine glands, intestines, pancreas, and the glomeruli of the kidney.

==== Sinusoidal ====
Sinusoidal capillaries or discontinuous capillaries are a special type of open-pore capillary, also known as a &quot;sinusoid&quot;, that have wider fenestrations that are 30–40 micrometres (μm) in diameter, with wider openings in the endothelium. Fenestrated capillaries have diaphragms that cover the pores whereas sinusoids lack a diaphragm and just have an open pore. These types of blood vessels allow red and white blood cells (7.5 μm – 25 μm diameter) and various serum proteins to pass, aided by a discontinuous basal lamina. These capillaries lack pinocytotic vesicles, and therefore use gaps present in cell junctions to permit transfer between endothelial cells, and hence across the membrane. Sinusoids are irregular spaces filled with blood and are mainly found in the liver, bone marrow, spleen, and brain circumventricular organs.

== Development ==
During early embryonic development, new capillaries are formed through vasculogenesis, the process of blood vessel formation that occurs through a novel production of endothelial cells that then form vascular tubes. The term &quot;angiogenesis&quot; denotes the formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels and already-present endothelium which divides. The small capillaries lengthen and interconnect to establish a network of vessels, a primitive vascular network that vascularises the entire yolk sac, connecting stalk, and chorionic villi.

== Function ==
The capillary wall performs an important function by allowing nutrients and waste substances to pass across it. Molecules larger than 3 nm such as albumin and other large proteins pass through transcellular transport carried inside vesicles, a process which requires them to go through the cells that form the wall. Molecules smaller than 3 nm such as water and gases cross the capillary wall through the space between cells in a process known as paracellular transport. These transport mechanisms allow bidirectional exchange of substances depending on osmotic gradients. Capillaries that form part of the blood–brain barrier only allow for transcellular transport as tight junctions between endothelial cells seal the paracellular space.

Capillary beds may control their blood flow via autoregulation. This allows an organ to maintain constant flow despite a change in central blood pressure. This is achieved by myogenic response, and in the kidney by tubuloglomerular feedback. When blood pressure increases, arterioles are stretched and subsequently constrict (a phenomenon known as the Bayliss effect) to counteract the increased tendency for high pressure to increase blood flow.

In the lungs, special mechanisms have been adapted to meet the needs of increased necessity of blood flow during exercise. When the heart rate increases and more blood must flow through the lungs, capillaries are recruited and are also distended to make room for increased blood flow. This allows blood flow to increase while resistance decreases. Extreme exercise can make capillaries vulnerable, with a breaking point similar to that of collagen.

Capillary permeability can be increased by the release of certain cytokines, anaphylatoxins, or other mediators (such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins, histamine, bradykinin, etc.) highly influenced by the immune system.

=== Starling equation ===

The transport mechanisms can be further quantified by the Starling equation. The Starling equation defines the forces across a semipermeable membrane and allows calculation of the net flux:

:formula_1

where:

: formula_2 is the net driving force,
: formula_3 is the proportionality constant, and
: formula_4 is the net fluid movement between compartments.

By convention, outward force is defined as positive, and inward force is defined as negative. The solution to the equation is known as the net filtration or net fluid movement (&quot;J&quot;&quot;v&quot;). If positive, fluid will tend to &quot;leave&quot; the capillary (filtration). If negative, fluid will tend to &quot;enter&quot; the capillary (absorption). This equation has a number of important physiologic implications, especially when pathologic processes grossly alter one or more of the variables.

According to Starling&#x27;s equation, the movement of fluid depends on six variables:
# Capillary hydrostatic pressure (&quot;P&quot;&quot;c&quot;)
# Interstitial hydrostatic pressure (&quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot;)
# Capillary oncotic pressure (&quot;c&quot;)
# Interstitial oncotic pressure (&quot;i&quot;)
# Filtration coefficient (&quot;K&quot;&quot;f&quot;)
# Reflection coefficient (&quot;σ&quot;)

== Clinical significance ==
Disorders of capillary formation as a developmental defect or acquired disorder are a feature in many common and serious disorders. Within a wide range of cellular factors and cytokines, issues with normal genetic expression and bioactivity of the vascular growth and permeability factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appear to play a major role in many of the disorders. Cellular factors include reduced number and function of bone-marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells. and reduced ability of those cells to form blood vessels.
* Formation of additional capillaries and larger blood vessels (angiogenesis) is a major mechanism by which a cancer may help to enhance its own growth. Disorders of retinal capillaries contribute to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration.
* Reduced capillary density (capillary rarefaction) occurs in association with cardiovascular risk factors and in patients with coronary heart disease.

=== Therapeutics ===
Major diseases where altering capillary formation could be helpful include conditions where there is excessive or abnormal capillary formation such as cancer and disorders harming eyesight; and medical conditions in which there is reduced capillary formation either for familial or genetic reasons, or as an acquired problem.
* In patients with the retinal disorder, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, local anti-VEGF therapy to limit the bio-activity of vascular endothelial growth factor has been shown to protect vision by limiting progression. In a wide range of cancers, treatment approaches have been studied, or are in development, aimed at decreasing tumour growth by reducing angiogenesis.

=== Blood sampling ===
Capillary blood sampling can be used to test for blood glucose (such as in blood glucose monitoring), hemoglobin, pH and lactate. It is generally performed by creating a small cut using a blood lancet, followed by sampling by capillary action on the cut with a test strip or small pipette. It is also used to test for sexually transmitted infections that are present in the blood stream, such as HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C, where a finger is lanced and a small amount of blood is sampled into a test tube.

== History ==
A 13th century manuscript by Ibn Nafis contains the earliest known description of capillaries. The manuscript records Ibn Nafis&#x27; prediction of the existence of the capillaries which he described as perceptible passages (&quot;manafidh&quot;) between pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein. These passages would later be identified by Marcello Malpighi as capillaries. He further states that the heart&#x27;s two main chambers (right and left ventricles) are separate and that blood cannot pass through the (interventricular) septum.

William Harvey did not explicitly predict the existence of capillaries, but he saw the need for some sort of connection between the arterial and venous systems. In 1653, he wrote, &quot;...the blood doth enter into every member through the arteries, and does return by the veins, and that the veins are the vessels and ways by which the blood is returned to the heart itself; and that the blood in the members and extremities does pass from the arteries into the veins (either mediately by an anastomosis, or immediately through the porosities of the flesh, or both ways) as before it did in the heart and thorax out of the veins, into the arteries...&quot;

Marcello Malpighi was the first to observe directly and correctly describe capillaries, discovering them in a frog&#x27;s lung 8 years later, in 1661.

August Krogh discovered how capillaries provide nutrients to animal tissue. For his work he was awarded the 1920 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. His 1922 estimate that total length of capillaries in a human body is as long as 100,000 km, had been widely adopted by textbooks and other secondary sources. This estimate was based on figures he gathered from &quot;an extraordinarily large person&quot;. More recent estimates give a number between 9,000 and 19,000 km.

<text>Raymond Merrill Smullyan (; May 25, 1919 – February 6, 2017) was an American mathematician, magician, concert pianist, logician, Taoist, and philosopher.

Born in Far Rockaway, New York, Smullyan&#x27;s first career choice was in stage magic. He earned a BSc from the University of Chicago in 1955 and his PhD from Princeton University in 1959. Smullyan is one of many logicians to have studied with Alonzo Church.

== Life ==
Smullyan was born on May 25, 1919, in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York, to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. His father was Isidore Smullyan, a Russian-born businessman who emigrated to Belgium when young and graduated from the University of Antwerp, his native language being French. His mother was Rosina Smullyan (née Freeman), a painter and actress born and raised in London. Both parents were musical, his father playing the violin and his mother playing the piano. Smullyan was the youngest of three children. His eldest brother, Emile Benoit Smullyan, later became an economist under the name of Emile Benoit. His sister was Gladys Smullyan, later Gladys Gwynn. His cousin was the philosopher Arthur Francis Smullyan (1912–1998). In Far Rockaway he was a grade school classmate of Richard Feynman.

Smullyan showed musical talent from a young age, playing both violin and piano. He studied with pianist Grace Hofheimer in New York. He had perfect pitch. He started his interest in logic at the age of 5. In 1931 he won a gold medal in the piano competition of the New York Music Week Association when he was aged 12 (the previous year he had won the silver medal). After graduating from grade school, the Depression forced his family to move to Manhattan, and he attended Theodore Roosevelt High School in The Bronx. He played violin in the school orchestra but devoted more time to playing the piano. At high school he fell in love with mathematics when he took a class in geometry. Apart from his classes in geometry, physics, and chemistry, however, he was dissatisfied with his high school, and dropped out. Smullyan studied mathematics on his own, including analytic geometry, calculus, and modern higher algebra – particularly group theory and Galois theory. He sat in on a course taught by Ernest Nagel at Columbia University that was being taken by his cousin, Arthur Smullyan, and independently discovered Boolean rings. He also spent a year at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. Smullyan did not graduate with a high school diploma, but he took the College Board exams to get into college. He studied mathematics and music at Pacific University in Oregon for one semester, and at Reed College for less than a semester, before following the pianist Berhard Abramowitsch to San Francisco. Smullyan audited classes at the University of California, Berkeley, before returning to New York, where he continued his independent study of modern abstract algebra. At this time he composed a number of chess problems which were published many years later; he also learned magic.

At the age of 24, Smullyan enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for three semesters, because he wanted to study modern algebra with a professor whose book he had read. He later transferred to the University of Chicago and majored in mathematics. After a break in which he worked as a magician in New York and met his first wife, he returned to the University of Chicago, where he also worked as a magician at night and taught piano on the faculty at Roosevelt University. While at Chicago he took three courses with the philosopher Rudolf Carnap, for which he wrote three term papers. Carnap recommended that he send the first term paper to Willard Van Orman Quine, which he did. Quine replied that he should tinker with his idea about what makes quantification theory tick. Of the other two term papers, one, entitled &quot;Languages in which Self-Reference is Possible&quot; (which Carnap showed to Kurt Gödel), was later published in 1957. The other was later published in his 1961 book &quot;Theory of Formal Systems&quot;. While still a student at the University of Chicago, on the basis of a recommendation from Carnap, he was hired by John G. Kemeny, the chair of the mathematics department at Dartmouth College. Smullyan taught at Dartmouth for two years. During that time he separated from his first wife, from whom he later divorced. He also used to visit his friends Gloria and Marvin Minsky (Gloria Minsky was his cousin) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The University of Chicago, after a battle between the faculty and administration, agreed to award Smullyan a bachelor of science degree in mathematics in 1955 based partly on courses he had taught at Dartmouth (although he had not taken them at Chicago). Both Carnap and Kemeny helped him to get accepted to the graduate program in mathematics at Princeton University. He received a PhD in mathematics from Princeton University in 1959. He completed his doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;Theory of formal systems&quot;, under the supervision of Alonzo Church, which was published in 1961. While a graduate student at Princeton he met his second wife, Blanche, a pianist and teacher, born in Belgium, to whom he was married for 48 years until she died in 2006.

While a PhD student, Smullyan&#x27;s term paper for Carnap, &quot;Languages in which Self-Reference is Possible&quot;, was published in 1957 in the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot;, showing that Gödelian incompleteness held for formal systems considerably more elementary than that of Kurt Gödel&#x27;s 1931 landmark paper. The contemporary understanding of Gödel&#x27;s theorem dates from this paper. Smullyan later made a compelling case that much of the fascination with Gödel&#x27;s theorem should be directed at Tarski&#x27;s theorem, which is much easier to prove and equally disturbing philosophically.

After getting his PhD from Princeton, he taught at Princeton for two years. He subsequently taught at New York University, at the State University of New York at New Paltz, at Smith College, and at the Belfer Graduate School of Science at Yeshiva University, before becoming professor of mathematics and computer science at Lehman College in the Bronx, where he taught undergraduate students from 1968 to 1984. He was also a professor of philosophy at the CUNY Graduate Center from 1976 to 1984, where he taught graduate students. He was subsequently a professor of philosophy at Indiana University, where he taught both undergraduate and graduate students. He was also an amateur astronomer, using a six-inch reflecting telescope for which he ground the mirror. Fellow mathematician Martin Gardner was a close friend.

Smullyan wrote many books about recreational mathematics and recreational logic. Most notably, one is titled &quot;What Is the Name of This Book?&quot; . His &quot;A Beginner&#x27;s Further Guide to Mathematical Logic&quot; , published in 2017, was his final book.

==Logic problems==
Many of Smullyan&#x27;s logic problems are extensions of classic puzzles. Knights and Knaves involves knights (who always tell the truth) and knaves (who always lie). This is based on a story of two doors and two guards, one who lies and one who tells the truth. One door leads to heaven and one to hell, and the puzzle is to find out which door leads to heaven by asking one of the guards a question. One way to do this is to ask, &quot;Which door would the other guard say leads to hell?&quot;. Unfortunately, this fails, as the liar can answer, &quot;He would say the door to paradise leads to hell,&quot; and the truth-teller would answer, &quot;He would say the door to paradise leads to hell.&quot; You must point at one of the doors as well as simply stating a question. For example, as philosopher Richard Turnbull has explained, you could point at either door and ask, &quot;Will the other guard say this is the door to paradise?&quot; The truth-teller will say &quot;No, &quot; if it is in fact the door to paradise, as will the liar. So you pick that door. The truth-teller will answer &quot;Yes,&quot; if it is the door to Hell, as will the liar, so you pick the other door. Note also that we are not told anything about the goals of either guard: for all we know, the liar may want to help us and the truth-teller not help us, or both are indifferent, so there&#x27;s no reason to think either one will phrase answers such as to provide us with the most optimally available kind of comprehension. This is behind the crucial role of actually pointing at a door directly while asking the question. This idea was famously used in the 1986 film &quot;Labyrinth&quot;.

In more complex puzzles, he introduces characters who may lie or tell the truth (referred to as &quot;normals&quot;), and furthermore instead of answering &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, use words which mean &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, but the reader does not know which word means which. The puzzle known as &quot;the hardest logic puzzle ever&quot; is based on these characters and themes. In his Transylvania puzzles, half of the inhabitants are insane, and believe only false things, whereas the other half are sane and believe only true things. In addition, humans always tell the truth, and vampires always lie. For example, an insane vampire will believe a false thing (2 + 2 is not 4) but will then lie about it, and say that it is false. A sane vampire knows 2 + 2 is 4, but will lie and say it is not. And &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot; for humans. Thus everything said by a sane human or an insane vampire is true, while everything said by an insane human or a sane vampire is false.
His book &quot;Forever Undecided&quot; popularizes Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems by phrasing them in terms of reasoners and their beliefs, rather than formal systems and what can be proved in them. For example, if a native of a knight/knave island says to a sufficiently self-aware reasoner, &quot;You will never believe that I am a knight&quot;, the reasoner cannot believe either that the native is a knight or that he is a knave without becoming inconsistent (i.e., holding two contradictory beliefs). The equivalent theorem is that for any formal system S, there exists a mathematical statement that can be interpreted as &quot;This statement is not provable in formal system S&quot;. If the system S is consistent, neither the statement nor its opposite will be provable in it. See also Doxastic logic.

Inspector Craig is a frequent character in Smullyan&#x27;s &quot;puzzle-novellas.&quot; He is generally called into a scene of a crime that has a solution that is mathematical in nature. Then, through a series of increasingly harder challenges, he (and the reader) begin to understand the principles in question. Finally the novella culminates in Inspector Craig (and the reader) solving the crime, utilizing the mathematical and logical principles learned. Inspector Craig generally does not learn the formal theory in question, and Smullyan usually reserves a few chapters after the Inspector Craig adventure to illuminate the analogy for the reader. Inspector Craig gets his name from William Craig.

His book &quot;To Mock a Mockingbird&quot; (1985) is a recreational introduction to the subject of combinatory logic.

Apart from writing about and teaching logic, Smullyan released a recording of his favorite baroque keyboard and classical piano pieces by composers such as Bach, Scarlatti, and Schubert. Some recordings are available on the Piano Society website, along with the video &quot;Rambles, Reflections, Music and Readings&quot;. He has also written two autobiographical works, one entitled &quot;Some Interesting Memories: A Paradoxical Life&quot; () and a later book entitled &quot;Reflections: The Magic, Music and Mathematics of Raymond Smullyan&quot; ().

In 2001, documentary filmmaker Tao Ruspoli made a film about Smullyan called &quot;This Film Needs No Title: A Portrait of Raymond Smullyan.&quot;

==Philosophy==

Smullyan wrote several books about Taoist philosophy, a philosophy he believed neatly solved most or all traditional philosophical problems as well as integrating mathematics, logic, and philosophy into a cohesive whole. One of Smullyan&#x27;s discussions of Taoist philosophy centers on the question of free will in an imagined conversation between a mortal human and God.

<text>A riding is an administrative jurisdiction or electoral district, particularly in several current or former Commonwealth countries.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;riding&quot; is descended from late Old English or (recorded only in Latin contexts or forms, e.g., , , , with Latin initial &quot;t&quot; here representing the Old English letter thorn). It came into Old English as a loanword from Old Norse , meaning a third part (especially of a county) – the original &quot;ridings&quot;, in the English counties of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, were in each case a set of three, though once the term was adopted elsewhere it was used for other numbers (compare to farthings). The modern form &quot;riding&quot; was the result of the initial &quot;th&quot; being absorbed in the final &quot;th&quot; or &quot;t&quot; of the words &quot;north&quot;, &quot;south&quot;, &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot;, by which it was normally preceded.

A common misconception holds that the term arose from some association between the size of the district and the distance that can be covered or encircled on horseback in a certain amount of time (compare the Walking Purchase).

==Australia==
The term was used in Australia as a division of some shire councils, similar to a ward in city, borough, town and many shire councils.

==Canada==

The term was used in 19th-century Canada to refer to subdivisions of counties.

In Canadian politics, &quot;riding&quot; is a colloquial term for a constituency or electoral district. Officially, &quot;electoral district&quot; is generally used, although government documents sometimes use the colloquial term. In colloquial Canadian French, a riding is known as , i.e., &#x27;county&#x27;, as the electoral districts in Quebec were historically identical to its counties; the official French term is .

The Canadian use of &quot;riding&quot; is derived from the English local government term, which was widely used in Canada in the 19th century. Most Canadian counties never had sufficient population to justify administrative subdivisions. Nonetheless, it was common, especially in Ontario, to divide counties with sufficient population into multiple electoral districts, which thus became known as ridings in official documents. The term was used in the legal descriptions of the electoral districts of Canada West in the Province of Canada. It was later used in the description of the new electoral districts which were created by the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, for the first elections to the new federal House of Commons and the new provincial Legislative Assembly of Ontario, immediately following Confederation. Soon after Confederation, the urban population grew (and more importantly, most city dwellers gained the franchise after property ownership was no longer required to gain the vote). Rural constituencies therefore became geographically larger through the 20th century and generally encompassed one or more counties each, and the word &quot;riding&quot; was then used to refer to any electoral division.

The local association for a political party, which legally is known as an electoral district association, is often referred to as a riding association.

==England==
===Yorkshire=== 

The ancient county of Yorkshire had three ridings, North, West and East, originally each subdivided into wapentakes which were created by the Vikings. Note that the bounds of the City of York lay outside all the ridings to emphasise its political impartiality.

The Yorkshire ridings were in many ways treated as separate administrative counties, having had separate quarter sessions and also separate lieutenancies since the Restoration. This practice was followed by the &quot;Local Government Act 1888&quot;, which made each of the three ridings an administrative county with an elected county council. These county councils, along with the ancient lieutenancies, were abolished in 1974 under the &quot;Local Government Act 1972&quot;.

A local government area, East Riding of Yorkshire, was created in 1996, but this does not cover the entire area of the former East Riding and includes areas from the historical West Riding.

According to the 12th century compilation known as the &quot;Leges Edwardi Confessoris&quot;, the riding was the third part of a county (); to it causes were brought which could not be determined in the wapentake, and a matter which could not be determined in the riding was brought into the court of the shire.

Riding courts were held after the Norman Conquest. A charter which Henry I granted to the Church of St Peters at York mentions &quot;,&quot; and (-mot designates popular assemblies), and exemptions from suit to the or riding are described in the charters of the Norman kings. As yet, however, the jurisdiction and functions of these courts have not been ascertained. It seems probable from the silence of the records that they had already fallen into disuse early in the 13th century.

Although no longer having any administrative role, the ridings of Yorkshire still play a part as cultural entities – they are used for the names of a number of groups and organisations and some people in Yorkshire associate themselves with one riding or another (see current usage of West Riding of Yorkshire). Winifred Holtby&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;South Riding&quot; and its adaptations were set in a fictional fourth riding. The title of the novel trilogy &quot;Red Riding&quot; by David Peace, set in Yorkshire, is a play on the word.

The Yorkshire Ridings Society calls for wider recognition of the historic borders of Yorkshire.

===Lindsey, Lincolnshire===

The Parts of Lindsey, one of the Parts of Lincolnshire, also possessed ridings, in this case the North, West, and South ridings.

==Ireland==
The &quot;Grand Jury (Ireland) Act 1836&quot; empowered the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to divide Irish counties into ridings with separate assizes held in different towns. This was to allow County Tipperary to be divided in 1838 into a North Riding and South Riding, because the county town of Clonmel was inconveniently far south for jurors from the north. Nenagh became the North Riding&#x27;s assize town. The ridings became separate administrative counties, with minor boundary adjustments, under the &quot;Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898&quot;, and were redenominated as counties &quot;North Tipperary&quot; and &quot;South Tipperary&quot; under the &quot;Local Government Act 2001&quot;. They were merged back into a single County Tipperary by the &quot;Local Government Reform Act 2014&quot;.

County Cork had been divided in 1823 into East and West Ridings for quarter sessions and petty sessions, but not for assizes, and so had a single county council after the 1898 changes. County Galway from 1837 had East and West Ridings for Royal Irish Constabulary and county surveyor purposes. The Cork and Galway ridings became largely obsolete after independence in 1922, although the names &quot;Cork East[/West] Riding&quot; were used for the relevant Garda Síochána (police) divisions into the 1990s.

==New Zealand==
Ridings existed in rural New Zealand in the late 19th and early to mid 20th century as part of larger county councils in the area. For example, The Taranaki County Council was divided into three separate ridings: Moa (south), Omata (west) and Waitara (east).

As use of the automobile became more popular with the improvement of roads, combined with the concurrent trend of urban drift (), the ridings were either merged back into their parent councils or separated off into county councils in their own right. The Taranaki County Council&#x27;s three ridings eventually split, with the Omata Riding remaining part of the Taranaki County Council, the Moa riding merging with the Inglewood Borough Council and the Waitara Riding becoming part of the Clifton County Council.

In 1989 these were again merged, reorganised into district and/or city councils. For example, the above three all merged with the New Plymouth Council and Waitara Borough Councils to form the New Plymouth District Council.

* Census, 1916. Return Showing the Population of the Dominion

==Scandinavia==
Ridings are originally Scandinavian institutions.
In Iceland the third part of a &quot;thing&quot; which corresponded roughly to an English county was called . The island of Gotland and the Swedish provinces Närke and Hälsingland were also divided into instead of hundreds.

In Norway, the seems to have been an ecclesiastical division.

==Farthings==
The term is analogous to fourths of a county, in a fashion similar to the old British farthing. They have also been found in Iceland and Gloucestershire. J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional world of Middle-earth, The Shire, is divided into farthings, into the Fourth Age.

<text>In the United States, a conservation easement (also called conservation covenant, conservation restriction or conservation servitude) is a power invested in a qualified land conservation organization called a &quot;land trust&quot;, or a governmental (municipal, county, state or federal) entity to constrain, as to a specified land area, the exercise of rights otherwise held by a landowner so as to achieve certain conservation purposes. It is an interest in real property established by agreement between a landowner and land trust or unit of government. The conservation easement &quot;runs with the land&quot;, meaning it is applicable to both present and future owners of the land. The grant of conservation easement, as with any real property interest, is part of the chain of title for the property and is normally recorded in local land records.

The conservation easement&#x27;s purposes will vary depending on the character of the particular property, the goals of the land trust or government unit, and the needs of the landowners. For example, an easement&#x27;s purposes (often called &quot;conservation objectives&quot;) might include any one or more of the following:
* Maintain and improve water quality;
* Perpetuate and foster the growth of healthy forest;
* Maintain and improve wildlife habitat and migration corridors;
* Protect scenic vistas visible from roads and other public areas; or
* Ensure that lands are managed so that they are always available for sustainable agriculture and forestry.

The conservation easement&#x27;s administrative terms for advancing the conservation objectives also vary but typically forbid or substantially constrain subdivision and other real estate development.

The most distinguishing feature of the conservation easement as a conservation tool is that it enables users to achieve specific conservation objectives on the land while keeping the land in the ownership and control of landowners for uses consistent with the conservation objectives.

Unlike land use regulation, a conservation easement is placed on property voluntarily by the owner whose rights are being restricted. The restrictions of the easement, once set in place, are however perpetual (and potentially reduce the market value of the remaining ownership interest in the property). Appraisals of the value of the easement, and financial arrangements between the parties (land owner and land trust), generally are kept private.

The landowner who grants a conservation easement continues to manage and otherwise privately own the land and may receive significant state and federal tax advantages for having donated and/or sold the conservation easement. In granting the conservation easement, the easement holder has a responsibility to monitor future uses of the land to ensure compliance with the terms of the easement and to enforce the terms if a violation occurs.

Although a conservation easement prohibits certain uses by the landowner, such an easement does not make the land public. On the contrary, many conservation easements confer no use of the land either to the easement holder or to the public. Furthermore, many conservation easements reserve to the landowner specific uses which if not reserved would be prohibited. Some conservation easements confer specific uses to the easement holder or to the public. These details are spelled out in the legal document that creates the conservation easement.

==Income tax deductions==
Landowners in the United States who donate a &quot;qualifying&quot; conservation easement to a &quot;qualified&quot; land protection organization under the regulations set forth in 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code may be eligible for a federal income tax deduction equal to the value of their donation. The value of the easement donation, as determined by a qualified appraiser, equals the difference between the fair market value of the property before and after the easement takes effect.

To qualify for this income tax deduction, the easement must be: a) perpetual; b) held by a qualified governmental or non-profit organization; and, c) serve a valid &quot;conservation purpose&quot;, meaning the property must have an appreciable natural, scenic, historic, scientific, recreational, or open space value. As a result of legislation signed by President George W. Bush on August 17, 2006 (H.R. 4 The Pensions Protection Act of 2006), in 2006 and 2007, conservation easement donors were able to deduct the value of their gift at the rate of 50% of their adjusted gross income (AGI) per year. Further, landowners with 50% or more of their income from agriculture were able to deduct the donation at a rate of 100% of their AGI. Any amount of the donation remaining after the first year could be carried forward for fifteen additional years (allowing a maximum of sixteen years within which the deduction may be utilized), or until the amount of the deduction has been used up, whichever comes first. With the passage of the Farm Bill in the summer of 2008 these expanded federal income tax incentives were extended such that they also apply to all conservation easements donated in 2008 and 2009. The provision was renewed annually each year between 2010 and 2014 and was finally incorporated to the tax code without an expiration date in 2015.

==Income tax credits (states)==
Land conservation advocates have long tried to enact additional tax incentives for landowners to donate easements, above the federal charitable deduction (and state tax deduction in states that conform to federal tax process). There has been discussion of creating a federal income tax credit for easement donors since around 1980. However, no federal tax credit has been enacted. States, however, have moved ahead to grant credits that can be used to pay state income tax to donors of qualified conservation easements. In 1983, North Carolina became the first state to establish such a program.

Attorney Philip Tabas of The Nature Conservancy promoted the state tax credit idea widely in the 1990s. In 1999, four state legislatures enacted state tax credit programs (Virginia, Delaware, Colorado, and Connecticut, in that order). South Carolina and California followed in 2000. Several other states have followed since.

For landowners with little income subject to state taxation, a tax credit is of little value and may be insufficient incentive to grant a conservation easement. For this reason, some states, including Colorado and Virginia, the state tax credit is transferable—that is, the donor/landowner can sell her/his credit to someone else; the buyer can use the purchased tax credit, normally purchased at a discount from face value, against their own Colorado income tax. However, caps on the amount of credit an easement can generate, and other restrictions, limit the scope of some state tax credit programs.

In the states where credit for conservation land donations is transferable, free markets have arisen. Brokers assist landowners with excess credit to contact buyers, and the brokers often handle payments and paperwork to protect the principals, and to ensure that transfers are fully reported to the state tax authorities. The federal and state tax treatment of profits from sale and use of transferable tax credit have been the subject of extensive discussion and the issuance of several guidance documents by the Internal Revenue Service.

The New Mexico state income tax credit was originated in 2003. New transferability legislation, effective January 1, 2008, applies retroactively to conservation easements effected from January 1, 2004.

The Virginia transferable credit program is the largest among the States in dollar value of property conserved. By the end of 2010, $2,512,000,000 of property value had been donated as easements in Virginia for which tax credit was claimed. The qualifying easements cover over of Virginia landscape. The Virginia program now (2011) grants about $110 million of new tax credit each year. The credit allowance is 40% of the appraised value of the easement donation, so this equates to $275 million of property value donated per year for protection of wildlife habitat, farmland and woodland, and scenic open space—in perpetuity. The other state tax credit programs are smaller in dollar measurement, but are very significant in the area and the conservation values that they cause to be protected. The concept of state tax credit action (in the absence of a federal tax credit) that Philip Tabas and The Nature Conservancy promoted in the 1990s has borne remarkable fruit, and continues to expand today.

==Estate tax reductions and exclusions==
For landowners who will leave sizable estates upon their death, the most important financial impact of a conservation easement may be a significant reduction in estate taxes. Estate taxes often make it difficult for heirs to keep land intact and in the family because of high estate tax rates and high development value of land. It may be necessary to subdivide or sell land for development in order to pay these taxes which may not be the desire of the landowner or their heirs. A conservation easement can often provide significant help with this problem in three important ways:

# &quot;Reduction in value of the estate.&quot; The deceased&#x27;s estate will be reduced by the value of the donated conservation easement. As a result, taxes will be lower because heirs will not be required to pay taxes on the extinguished development rights. In other words, heirs will only have to pay estate taxes on preserved farmland values, and not full development values.
#&quot;Estate exclusion.&quot; Section 2031(c) of the tax code provides further estate tax incentives for properties subject to a donated conservation easement. When property has a qualified conservation easement placed upon it, up to an additional 40% of the value of land (subject to a $500,000 cap) may be excluded from the estate when the landowner dies. This exclusion is in addition to the reduction in land value attributable to the easement itself as described above.
#&quot;After death easement.&quot; Heirs may also receive these benefits (but not the income tax deduction) by electing to donate a conservation easement after the landowner&#x27;s death and prior to filing the estate return (called a &quot;post mortem&quot; election).

In Pennsylvania, conservation restrictions on land included in the estate can reduce the inheritance tax owed.

==Property tax incentives==
Many states offer property tax incentives to conservation easement donors.

==Issues to consider==
* As is the case with any property interest, a conservation easement may be taken by eminent domain (and thereby extinguished) when the public value of the proposed project exceeds that of the conservation interest being protected by the easement.
* Conservation easements may result in a significant reduction in the sale price of the land because a builder can no longer develop it. In fact, this difference in value is the basis for the granting of the original tax incentives. An estimate of 35%–65% value reduction has been made on conservation easement land to the land owner.
* Clear boundaries of adjacent properties are not always consistent with each other. Currently, the NCED manages this issue by snapping boundary polygons to a standard parcel layer which may differ from the original data provided by a landowner.
* Against the background of the beneficial effects for nature provided by conservation easements, research suggests to also consider in-fee driven conservation efforts (i.e. direct purchase of land through conservation actors). The cost-effectiveness of either governance approach depends on various aspects such as economic and local ecological conditions, which hence need to be closely considered for the decision.

==Purchase of conservation easements==
Many conservation easements are purchased with funds from federal, state, and local governments, nonprofit organizations, or private donors. In these cases, landowners are paid directly for the purchase of the conservation easement.

The Farm Bill, updated every five or more years, provides an important source of funds for conservation easement purchase. The 2014 Farm Bill created the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) by consolidating the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program, the Grassland Reserve Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program. Under ACEP, the Natural Resources Conservation Service helps tribes, state and local governments, and land trusts protect agriculture from development and other non-agricultural uses. ACEP includes Agricultural Land Easements and Wetland Reserve Easements. Agricultural land easements preserve land for food production and aids in soil and water conservation. Wetland reserve easements aim to restore wetland areas that have been converted into agricultural land. To maximize the benefits, the program targets land that has both a high chance of restoration success and a history of low crop yields or crop failure. The Farm Bill also funds the purchase of conservation easements for forestland. The Forest Legacy Program is a voluntary Federal program in partnership with States which protects privately owned forest lands. Landowners are required to prepare a multiple resource management plan as part of the conservation easement acquisition.

The majority of states have direct funding sources for conservation. Commonly used funding sources include real estate transfer tax, legislative bonds, and lottery proceeds. For instance, in 2014, New Jersey added conservation funding from corporate business taxes through constitutional amendment, approved by 65% of voters. Many states and counties have programs for the purchase of agricultural conservation easements (PACE) to protect productive farmland from non-agricultural development. In 1974, Suffolk County in New York enacted the first PACE (also known as purchase of development rights or PDR) program. King County in Washington and the states of Maryland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut quickly followed suit. As of 2016, the PACE program operates in 32 states through both state and local programs.

==National Conservation Easement Database==
The National Conservation Easement Database maps conservation easements and provides a resource for understanding what resources conservation easements protect in the U.S. As of 2018, the National Conservation Easement Database included over 130,000 conservation easements on 24.7 million acres.

<doc id="56522" wikidata="Q76074" url="?curid=56522" title="Right-wing politics">
<text>Right-wing politics is the range of political ideologies that view certain social orders and hierarchies as inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable, typically supporting this position based on natural law, economics, authority, property, religion, or tradition. Hierarchy and inequality may be seen as natural results of traditional social differences or competition in market economies.

Right-wing politics are considered the counterpart to left-wing politics, and the left–right political spectrum is the most common political spectrum. The right includes social conservatives and fiscal conservatives, as well as right-libertarians. &quot;Right&quot; and &quot;right-wing&quot; have been variously used as compliments and pejoratives describing neoliberal, conservative, and fascist economic and social ideas.

== Positions ==
The following positions are typically associated with right-wing politics.

=== Anti-communism ===

Early communists used the term &quot;right-wing&quot; in reference to conservatives, placing the conservatives on the right, the liberals in the centre and the communists on the left. Both the conservatives and the liberals were strongly anti-communist, although conservatives&#x27; anti-communism is much stronger than liberals&#x27;. The history of the use of the term &quot;right-wing&quot; about anti-communism is a complicated one.

Early Marxist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the European continent at the time. Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views and the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;, which began &quot;[a] spectre [that] is haunting Europe&quot;, and stated that monarchs feared for their thrones. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the Russian Empire, the German Empire, and Austria-Hungary, the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe before World War I. Many monarchists (except constitutional monarchists) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order. The struggle between monarchists and communists was often described as a struggle between the Right and the Left.

By World War I, in most European monarchies the divine right of kings had become discredited and was replaced by liberal and nationalist movements. Most European monarchs became figureheads, or they yielded some power to elected governments. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution inspired a series of other communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917–1923. Many of these, such as the German Revolution, were defeated by nationalist and monarchist military units. During this period, nationalism began to be considered right-wing, especially when it opposed the internationalism of the communists.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the decline of traditional right-wing politics. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising fascist movements on the one hand and by American-inspired liberal conservatives on the other. When communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, their opponents were usually colonial authorities and the term &quot;right-wing&quot; came to be applied to colonialism.

After World War II, communism became a global phenomenon and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the United States and its NATO allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religious values, and nationalism. Throughout the Cold War, postcolonial governments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America turned to the United States for political and economic support. Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying Wall Street as the oppressor of the masses. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy, and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of several domestic policies that are collectively known under the term &quot;McCarthyism&quot;. While both liberals and conservatives were anti-communist, the followers of Senator McCarthy were called &quot;right-wing&quot; and those on the right called liberals who favored free speech, even for communists, &quot;leftist&quot;.

=== Economics ===
Early forms of corporatism would be developed in Classical Greece and used in Ancient Rome. Plato would develop the ideas of totalitarian and communitarian corporatist systems of natural based classes and social hierarchies that would be organized based on function, such that groups would cooperate to achieve social harmony by emphasizing collectives interests over individual interests. Corporatism as a political ideology advocates the organization of society by corporate groups—such as agricultural, labour, military, scientific, or guild associations—based on their common interests.

After the decline of the Western Roman Empire corporatism became limited to religious orders and to the idea of Christian brotherhood, especially in the context of economic transactions. From the High Middle Ages onwards corporatist organizations became increasingly common in Europe, including such groups as religious orders, monasteries, fraternities, military orders such as the Knights Templar and the Teutonic Order, educational organizations such as the emerging universities and learned societies, the chartered towns and cities, and most notably the guild system which dominated the economics of population centers in Europe.

In post-revolutionary France, the Right fought against the rising power of those who had grown rich through commerce, and sought to preserve the rights of the hereditary nobility. They were uncomfortable with capitalism, the Enlightenment, individualism, and industrialism, and fought to retain traditional social hierarchies and institutions. In Europe&#x27;s history, there have been strong collectivist right-wing movements, such as in the social Catholic right, that have exhibited hostility to all forms of liberalism (including economic liberalism) and have historically advocated for paternalist class harmony involving an organic-hierarchical society where workers are protected while class hierarchy remains.

In the nineteenth century, the Right had shifted to support the newly rich in some European countries (particularly Britain) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing movements—such as Carlism in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany, and Russia—remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. Nevertheless, a few right-wing movements—notably the French Nouvelle Droite, CasaPound, and American paleoconservatism—are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society. These forces see capitalism and industrialism as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that are essential for social order.
In modern times, &quot;right-wing&quot; is sometimes used to describe &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism. In Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflicts with workers after 1848. In France, the Right&#x27;s support of capitalism can be traced to the late nineteenth century. The so-called neoliberal Right, popularised by US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, combines support for free markets, privatisation, and deregulation with traditional right-wing support for social conformity. Right-wing libertarianism (sometimes known as libertarian conservatism or conservative libertarianism) supports a decentralised economy based on economic freedom and holds property rights, free markets, and free trade to be the most important kinds of freedom. Political theorist Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked.

=== Nationalism ===

In France, nationalism was originally a left-wing and republican ideology. After the period of &quot;boulangisme&quot; and the Dreyfus affair, nationalism became a trait of the right-wing. Right-wing nationalists sought to define and defend a &quot;true&quot; national identity from elements which they believed were corrupting that identity. Some were supremacists, who in accordance with scientific racism and social Darwinism applied the concept of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; to nations and races.

Right-wing nationalism was influenced by Romantic nationalism in which the state derives its political legitimacy from the organic unity of those who it governs. This generally includes the language, race, culture, religion, and customs of the nation, all of which were &quot;born&quot; within its culture. Linked with right-wing nationalism is cultural conservatism, which supports the preservation of the heritage of a nation or culture and often sees deviations from cultural norms as an existential threat.

In the 21st century, neo-nationalism came to prominence after the Cold War in the Western world. It is typically associated with cultural conservatism, populism, anti-globalization, and nativism and is opposed to immigration. The ideology takes historical association in determining membership in a nation, rather than racial concepts.

=== Natural law and traditionalism ===

Right-wing politics typically justifies a hierarchical society based on natural law or tradition.

Traditionalism was advocated by a group of United States university professors (labelled the &quot;New Conservatives&quot; by the popular press) who rejected the concepts of individualism, liberalism, modernity, and social progress, seeking instead to promote what they identified as cultural and educational renewal and a revived interest in concepts perceived by traditionalists as truths that endure from age to age alongside basic institutions of western society such as the church, the family, the state, and business.

=== Populism ===

Right-wing populism is a combination of civic-nationalism, cultural-nationalism and sometimes ethno-nationalism, localism, along with anti-elitism, using populist rhetoric to provide a critique of existing political institutions. According to Margaret Canovan, a right-wing populist is &quot;a charismatic leader, using the tactics of politicians&#x27; populism to go past the politicians and intellectual elite and appeal to the reactionary sentiments of the populace, often buttressing his claim to speak for the people by the use of referendums&quot;.

In Europe, right-wing populism often takes the form of distrust of the European Union, and of politicians in general, combined with anti-immigrant rhetoric and a call for a return to traditional, national values. Daniel Stockemer states, the radical right is, &quot;Targeting immigrants as a threat to employment, security and cultural cohesion.&quot;

In the United States, the Tea Party movement stated that the core beliefs for membership were the primacy of individual liberties as defined by the Constitution of the United States, preference for a small federal government, and respect for the rule of law. Some policy positions included opposition to illegal immigration and support for a strong national military force, the right to individual gun ownership, cutting taxes, reducing government spending, and balancing the budget.

In Indonesia, Islamic populism has a significant impact on right-wing politics. This is largely due to the historical context which Islamic organizations had during the 1960s in destroying the Indonesian Communist Party. Whilst the party is adopting democratic processes with neo-liberal market economies, socially pluralist positions aren&#x27;t necessarily adopted. The Islamic populism in Indonesia has boosted its influence in 1998 after the demise of the Suharto authoritarian regime. Islamic populism in Indonesia has similar properties with Islamic populist regimes like in the Middle East, Turkey and North Africa (MENA). The emphasis on social justice, pluralism, equality and progressive agendas could be potentially mobilized by Islamic cultural resources. 

In India, Bharatiya Janata Party supporters have more authoritarian, nativist, and populist ideas than other Indian citizens. Under Narendra Modi, the BJP, populism is a core part of the party&#x27;s ideology. The main populist idea is that the ordinary, &quot;good&quot; individuals are continuously under attack from the &quot;bad&quot; political forces, media, etc. Since Narendra Modi became the leader of the BJP, it has increasingly been associated as a populist radical right party (PRR), however, traditionally the party was viewed as a Hindu nationalist party.

=== Religion ===
Philosopher and diplomat Joseph de Maistre argued for the indirect authority of the Pope over temporal matters. According to Maistre, only governments which were founded upon Christian constitutions—which were implicit in the customs and institutions of all European societies, especially the Catholic European monarchies—could avoid the disorder and bloodshed that followed the implementation of rationalist political programs, such as the chaos which occurred during the French Revolution. Some prelates of the Church of England–established by Henry VIII and headed by the current sovereign—are given seats in the House of Lords (as Lords Spiritual), but they are considered politically neutral rather than specifically right- or left-wing.

American right-wing media outlets oppose sex outside marriage and same-sex marriage, and they sometimes reject scientific positions on evolution and other matters where science tends to disagree with the Bible.

The term &quot;family values&quot; has been used by right-wing parties—such as the Republican Party in the United States, the Family First Party in Australia, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, and the Bharatiya Janata Party in India—to signify support for traditional families and opposition to the changes the modern world has made in how families live. Supporters of &quot;family values&quot; may oppose abortion, euthanasia, and birth control.

Outside the West, the Hindu nationalist movement has attracted privileged groups which fear encroachment on their dominant positions, as well as &quot;plebeian&quot; and impoverished groups which seek recognition around a majoritarian rhetoric of cultural pride, order, and national strength.

In Israel, Meir Kahane advocated that Israel should be a theocratic state, where non-Jews have no voting rights, and the far-right Lehava strictly opposes Jewish assimilation and the Christian presence in Israel. The Jewish Defence League (JDL) in the United States was classified as &quot;a right wing terrorist group&quot; by the FBI in 2001.

Many Islamist groups have been called right-wing, including the Great Union Party, the Combatant Clergy Association/Association of Militant Clergy, and the Islamic Society of Engineers of Iran.

=== Social stratification ===
Right-wing politics involves, in varying degrees, the rejection of some egalitarian objectives of left-wing politics, claiming either that social or economic inequality is natural and inevitable or that it is beneficial to society. Right-wing ideologies and movements support social order. The original French right-wing was called &quot;the party of order&quot; and held that France needed a strong political leader to keep order.

Conservative British scholar R. J. White, who rejects egalitarianism, wrote: &quot;Men are equal before God and the laws, but unequal in all else; hierarchy is the order of nature, and privilege is the reward of honourable service&quot;. American conservative Russell Kirk also rejected egalitarianism as imposing sameness, stating: &quot;Men are created different; and a government that ignores this law becomes an unjust government for it sacrifices nobility to mediocrity&quot;. Kirk took as one of the &quot;canons&quot; of conservatism the principle that &quot;civilized society requires orders and classes&quot;. Italian scholar Norberto Bobbio argued that the right-wing is inegalitarian compared to the left-wing, as he argued that equality is a relative, not absolute, concept.

Right libertarians reject collective or state-imposed equality as undermining reward for personal merit, initiative, and enterprise. In their view, such imposed equality is unjust, limits personal freedom, and leads to social uniformity and mediocrity.

In the view of philosopher Jason Stanley in &quot;How Fascism Works&quot;, the &quot;politics of hierarchy&quot; is one of the hallmarks of fascism, which refers to a &quot;glorious past&quot; in which members of the rightfully dominant group sat atop the hierarchy, and attempt to recreate this state of being.

== History ==
According to &quot;The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought&quot;, (2003) the Right has gone through five distinct historical stages:
# The reactionary right sought a return to aristocracy and established religion.
# The moderate right distrusted intellectuals and sought limited government.
# The radical right favored a romantic and aggressive form of nationalism.
# The extreme right proposed anti-immigration policies and implicit racism.
# The neo-liberal right sought to combine a market economy and economic deregulation with the traditional right-wing beliefs in patriotism, elitism and law and order.

The political terms &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; were first used in the 18th century, during the French Revolution, referencing the seating arrangement of the French parliament. Those who sat to the right of the chair of the presiding officer (&quot;le président&quot;) were generally supportive of the institutions of the monarchist Old Regime. The original &quot;Right&quot; in France was formed in reaction to the &quot;Left&quot; and comprised those supporting hierarchy, tradition, and clericalism. The expression (&quot;the right&quot;) increased in use after the restoration of the monarchy in 1815, when it was applied to the ultra-royalists.

From the 1830s to the 1880s, the Western world&#x27;s social class structure and economy shifted from nobility and aristocracy towards capitalism. This shift affected centre-right movements such as the British Conservative Party, which responded supporting capitalism.

The people of English-speaking countries did not apply the terms &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; to their politics until the 20th century. The term &quot;right-wing&quot; was originally applied to traditional conservatives, monarchists, and reactionaries; a revision of this which occurred sometime between the 1920s and 1950s considers the &quot;far-right to&quot; denote fascism, Nazism, and racial supremacy.

Rightist regimes were common in Europe in the Interwar period, 1919–1938.

=== China ===

==== Republic of China (1912–1949) ====
Among Kuomintang (KMT)&#x27;s conservatives during the Republic of China, Dai Jitao Thought supporters formed the Western Hills Group in the 1920s.

Chiang Kai-shek initially claimed himself as a &#x27;centrist&#x27; in the KMT left-right conflict, but became an anti-communist right-wing after Shanghai massacre. Chiangism (or &#x27;Chiang Kai-shek Thought&#x27;) was related to Confucianism, party-state capitalism, paternalistic conservatism, and Chinese nationalism.

==== People&#x27;s Republic of China ====
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) describes itself as Marxist, and has not officially abandoned leftist ideology, Marxism–Leninism, or socialism with Chinese characteristics. Christer Pursiainen has characterized the CCP as a right-wing political party, pointing to an ideological change within the party under Jiang Zemin&#x27;s leadership during the 1990s.

Neoauthoritarianism is a current of political thought that rose in China in the late 1980&#x27;s and came into ascendancy after the death of Deng Xiaoping; it advocates a powerful state to facilitate market reforms. It has been described as right-wing, classically conservative even though it incorporated some aspects of Marxist–Leninist and Maoist theories.

=== France ===
The political term &quot;right-wing&quot; was first used during the French Revolution, when liberal deputies of the Third Estate generally sat to the left of the presiding officer&#x27;s chair, a custom that began in the Estates General of 1789. The nobility, members of the Second Estate, generally sat to the right. In the successive legislative assemblies, monarchists who supported the Old Regime were commonly referred to as rightists because they sat on the right side. A major figure on the right was Joseph de Maistre, who argued for an authoritarian form of conservatism.

Throughout France in the 19th century, the main line dividing the left and right was between supporters of the republic and those of the monarchy, who were often secularist and Catholic respectively. On the right, the Legitimists and Ultra-royalists held counter-revolutionary views, while the Orléanists hoped to create a constitutional monarchy under their preferred branch of the royal family, which briefly became a reality after the 1830 July Revolution.

The centre-right Gaullists in post-World War II France advocated considerable social spending on education and infrastructure development as well as extensive economic regulation, but limited the wealth redistribution measures characteristic of social democracy.

=== Hungary ===
The dominance of the political right of inter-war Hungary, after the collapse of a short-lived Communist regime, was described by historian István Deák:
:Between 1919 and 1944 Hungary was a rightist country. Forged out of a counter-revolutionary heritage, its governments advocated a &quot;nationalist Christian&quot; policy; they extolled heroism, faith, and unity; they despised the French Revolution, and they spurned the liberal and socialist ideologies of the 19th century. The governments saw Hungary as a bulwark against bolshevism and bolshevism&#x27;s instruments: socialism, cosmopolitanism, and Freemasonry. They perpetrated the rule of a small clique of aristocrats, civil servants, and army officers, and surrounded with adulation the head of the state, the counterrevolutionary Admiral Horthy.

=== India ===

Although freedom fighters are favoured, the right-wing tendency to elect or appoint politicians and government officials based on aristocratic and religious ties is common to almost all the states of India. Multiple political parties however identify with terms and beliefs which are, by political consensus, right or left wing. Certain political parties such as the Bharatiya Janata Party, identify with conservative and nationalist elements. Some, such as the Indian National Congress, take a liberal stance. The Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), and others, identify with left-wing socialist and communist concepts. Other political parties take differing stands, and hence cannot be clearly grouped as the left- and the right-wing.

=== United Kingdom ===

In British politics, the terms &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s during debates over the Spanish Civil War.

=== United States ===


In the United States, following the Second World War, social conservatives joined with right-wing elements of the Republican Party to gain support in traditionally Democratic voting populations like white southerners and Catholics. Ronald Reagan&#x27;s election to the presidency in 1980 cemented the alliance between the religious right in the United States and social conservatives.

In 2019, the United States populace leaned center-right, with 37% of Americans self-identifying as conservative, compared to 35% moderate and 24% liberal. This was continuing a decades long trend of the country leaning center-right.

The United States Department of Homeland Security defines right-wing extremism in the United States as &quot;broadly divided into those groups, movements, and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups), and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.&quot;

== Types ==
The meaning of right-wing &quot;varies across societies, historical epochs, and political systems and ideologies.&quot; According to &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics&quot;, in liberal democracies, the political right opposes socialism and social democracy. Right-wing parties include conservatives, Christian democrats, classical liberals, and nationalists, as well as fascists on the far-right.

British academics Noël O&#x27;Sullivan and Roger Eatwell divide the right into five types: reactionary, moderate, radical, extreme, and new. Chip Berlet wrote that each of these &quot;styles of thought&quot; are &quot;responses to the left&quot;, including liberalism and socialism, which have arisen since the 1789 French Revolution.

# The reactionary right looks toward the past and is &quot;aristocratic, religious and authoritarian&quot;.
# The moderate right, typified by the writings of Edmund Burke, is tolerant of change, provided it is gradual and accepts some aspects of liberalism, including the rule of law and capitalism, although it sees radical &quot;laissez-faire&quot; and individualism as harmful to society. The moderate right often promotes nationalism and social welfare policies.
# Radical right is a descriptive term that was developed after World War II and it was applied to groups and ideologies such as McCarthyism, the John Birch Society, Thatcherism, and the Republikaner Party. Eatwell stresses that this usage of the term has &quot;major typological problems&quot; because it &quot;has also been applied to clearly democratic developments.&quot; The radical right includes right-wing populism and various other subtypes.
# The extreme right has four traits: &quot;1) anti-democracy, 2) ultranationalism, 3) racism, and 4) the strong state.&quot;
# The New Right consists of the liberal conservatives, who stress small government, free markets, and individual initiative.

Other authors make a distinction between the centre-right and the far-right.
* Parties of the centre-right generally support liberal democracy, capitalism, the market economy (though they may accept government regulation to control monopolies), private property rights, and a limited welfare state (for example, government provision of education and medical care). They support conservatism and economic liberalism and oppose socialism and communism.
* By contrast, the phrase &quot;far-right&quot; is used to describe those who favor an absolutist government, which uses the power of the state to support the dominant ethnic group or religion and criminalize other ethnic groups or religions. Typical examples of leaders to whom the far-right label is often applied are: Francisco Franco in Spain, Benito Mussolini in Italy, Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany, Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and Jorge Rafael Videla in Argentina.

<doc id="56525" wikidata="Q186319" url="?curid=56525" title="Triglyceride">
<text>A triglyceride (from &quot;&quot; and &quot;glyceride&quot;; also TG, triacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol and three fatty acids.
Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other vertebrates as well as vegetable fat.
They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver and are a major component of human skin oils.

Many types of triglycerides exist. One specific classification focuses on saturated and unsaturated types. Saturated fats have &quot;no&quot; C=C groups; unsaturated fats feature one or more C=C groups. Unsaturated fats tend to have a lower melting point than saturated analogues; as a result, they are often liquid at room temperature.

== Chemical structure ==
The three fatty acids substituents can be the same, but they are usually different. Many triglycerides are known because many fatty acids are known. The chain lengths of the fatty acid groups vary in naturally occurring triglycerides, Those containing 16, 18, or 20 carbon atoms are defined as long-chain triglycerides, while medium-chain triglycerides contain shorter fatty acids. Animals synthesize even-numbered fatty acids, but bacteria possess the ability to synthesise odd- and branched-chain fatty acids. As a result, ruminant animal fat contains odd-numbered fatty acids, such as 15, due to the action of bacteria in the rumen. Many fatty acids are unsaturated; some are polyunsaturated (e.g., those derived from linoleic acid).

Most natural fats contain a complex mixture of individual triglycerides. Because of their heterogeneity, they melt over a broad range of temperatures. Cocoa butter is unusual in that it is composed of only a few triglycerides, derived from palmitic, oleic, and stearic acids in the 1-, 2-, and 3-positions of glycerol, respectively.

The simplest triglycerides are those where the three fatty acids are identical. Their names indicate the fatty acid: stearin derived from stearic acid, triolein derived from oleic acid, palmitin derived from palmitic acid, etc. These compounds can be obtained in three crystalline forms (polymorphs): α, β, and β′, the three forms differing in their melting points.

A triglyceride containing different fatty acids is known as a &quot;mixed triglyceride&quot;. These are more common in nature.

If the first and third fatty acids on the glycerol differ, then the mixed triglyceride is chiral.

==Physical properties==
Triglycerides are colorless, although degraded samples can appear yellowish. Stearin, a simple, saturated, symmetrical triglyceride, is a solid near room temperature, but most examples are oils. Their densities range from around 0.89 with very long-chain fatty acids, through about 0.93 to 0.98 with medium-chain, and above 1.0 for very-short-chain acids.

==Biosynthesis==
Triglycerides are tri-esters derived from the condensation reaction of glycerol with three fatty acids. Their formation can be summarised by the following overall equation:

In nature, the formation of triglycerides is not random; rather, specific fatty acids are selectively condensed with the hydroxyl functional groups of glycerol. Animal fats typically have unsaturated fatty acid residues on carbon atoms 1 and 3. Extreme examples of non-random fats are cocoa butter (mentioned above) and lard, which contains about 20% triglyceride with palmitic acid on carbon 2 and oleic acid on carbons 1 and 3. An early step in the biosynthesis is the formation of the glycerol-1-phosphate:

The three oxygen atoms in this phosphate ester are differentiated, setting the stage for regiospecific formation of triglycerides, as the diol reacts selectively with coenzyme-A derivatives of the fatty acids, RC(O)S–CoA:

The phosphate ester linkage is then hydrolysed to make way for the introduction of a third fatty acid ester:


==Nomenclature==
===Common fat names===
Fats are often named after their source, e.g., olive oil, cod liver oil, shea butter, tail fat. Some have traditional names of their own, e.g., butter, lard, ghee, and margarine. The composition of these natural fats are somewhat variable. The oleic acid component in olive oil can vary from 64% to 86%.

===Chemical fatty acid names===
Triglycerides are then commonly named as esters of those acids, as in glyceryl 1,2-dioleate 3-palmitate, the name for a brood pheromone of the honey bee. Where the fatty acid residues in a triglyceride are all the same, names like olein (for glyceryl trioleate) and palmitin (for glyceryl tripalmitate) are common.

===IUPAC===
In the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry&#x27;s (IUPAC&#x27;s) general chemical nomenclature for organic compounds, any organic structure can be named by starting from its corresponding hydrocarbon and then specifying differences so as to describe its structure completely. For fatty acids, for example, the position and orientation of carbon-carbon double bonds is specified counting from the carboxyl functional group. Thus, oleic acid is formally named (9&quot;Z&quot;)-octadec-9-enoic acid, which describes that the compound has:
* an 18 carbon chain (&quot;octadec-&quot;) with the carbon of the carboxyl (&quot;-oic acid&quot;) given the number 1
* all carbon-carbon bonds are single except for the double bond then joins carbon 9 (&quot;9-en&quot;) to carbon 10
* the chain connects to each of the carbons of the double bond on the same side (hence, &quot;cis&quot;, or &quot;(9&quot;Z&quot;)&quot; - the &quot;Z&quot; being an abbreviation for the German word zusammen, meaning together).
IUPAC nomenclature can also handle branched chains and derivatives where hydrogen atoms are replaced by other chemical groups. Triglycerides take formal IUPAC names according to the rule governing naming of esters. For example, the formal name propane-1,2,3-tryl 1,2-bis((9&quot;Z&quot;)-octadec-9-enoate) 3-(hexadecanoate) applies to the pheromone informally named as glyceryl 1,2-dioleate-3-palmitate, and also known by other common names including 1,2-dioleoyl-3-palmitoylglycerol, glycerol dioleate palmitate, and 3-palmito-1,2-diolein.

===Fatty acid code===
A notation specific for fatty acids with unbranched chain, that is as precise as the IUPAC one but easier to parse, is a code of the form &quot;{N}:{D} &quot;cis&quot;-{CCC} &quot;trans&quot;-{TTT}&quot;, where {N} is the number of carbons (including the carboxyl one), {D} is the number of double bonds, {CCC} is a list of the positions of the &quot;cis&quot; double bonds, and {TTT} is a list of the positions of the &quot;trans&quot; bonds. Either or both &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; lists and their labels are omitted if there are no multiple bonds with that geometry. For example, the codes for stearic, oleic, elaidic, and vaccenic acids are &quot;18:0&quot;, &quot;18:1 &quot;cis&quot;-9&quot;, &quot;18:1 &quot;trans&quot;-9&quot;, and &quot;18:1 &quot;trans&quot;-11&quot;, respectively. Catalpic acid, (9&quot;E&quot;,11&quot;E&quot;,13&quot;Z&quot;)-octadeca-9,11,13-trienoic acid according to IUPAC nomenclature, has the code &quot;18:3 &quot;cis&quot;-13 &quot;trans&quot;-9,11&quot;.

==Saturated and unsaturated fats==

For human nutrition, an important classification of fats is based on the number and position of double bonds in the constituent fatty acids. Saturated fat has a predominance of saturated fatty acids, without any double bonds, while unsaturated fat has predominantly unsaturated acids with double bonds. (The names refer to the fact that each double bond means two fewer hydrogen atoms in the chemical formula. Thus, a saturated fatty acid, having no double bonds, has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms for a given number of carbon atomsthat is, it is &quot;saturated&quot; with hydrogen atoms.)

Unsaturated fatty acids are further classified into monounsaturated (MUFAs), with a single double bond, and polyunsaturated (PUFAs), with two or more. Natural fats usually contain several different saturated and unsaturated acids, even on the same molecule. For example, in most vegetable oils, the saturated palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acid residues are usually attached to positions 1 and 3 (sn1 and sn3) of the glycerol hub, whereas the middle position (sn2) is usually occupied by an unsaturated one, such as oleic (C18:1, ω–9) or linoleic (C18:2, ω–6).)

Saturated fats generally have a higher melting point than unsaturated ones with the same molecular weight, and thus are more likely to be solid at room temperature. For example, the animal fats tallow and lard are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids. Olive and linseed oils on the other hand are unsaturated and liquid. Unsaturated fats are prone to oxidation by air, which causes them to become rancid and inedible.

The double bonds in unsaturated fats can be converted into single bonds by reaction with hydrogen effected by a catalyst. This process, called hydrogenation, is used to turn vegetable oils into solid or semisolid vegetable fats like margarine, which can substitute for tallow and butter and (unlike unsaturated fats) resist rancidification. Under some conditions, hydrogenation can creates some unwanted &quot;trans&quot; acids from &quot;cis&quot; acids.

In cellular metabolism, unsaturated fat molecules yield slightly less energy (i.e., fewer calories) than an equivalent amount of saturated fat. The heats of combustion of saturated, mono-, di-, and tri-unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acid esters have been measured as 2859, 2828, 2794, and 2750 kcal/mol, respectively; or, on a weight basis, 10.75, 10.71, 10.66, and 10.58 kcal/ga decrease of about 0.6% for each additional double bond.

The greater the degree of unsaturation in a fatty acid (i.e., the more double bonds in the fatty acid) the more vulnerable it is to lipid peroxidation (rancidity). Antioxidants can protect unsaturated fat from lipid peroxidation.

==Commercial applications==
While it is the &quot;nutritional&quot; aspects of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are generally of greatest interest, these materials also have non-food applications. 

Linseed oil and related oils are important components of useful products used in oil paints and related coatings. Linseed oil is rich in di- and tri-unsaturated fatty acid components, which tend to harden in the presence of oxygen. This heat-producing hardening process is peculiar to these so-called &quot;drying oils&quot;. It is caused by a polymerization process that begins with oxygen molecules attacking the carbon backbone. Aside from llinseed oil, other oils exhibit drying properties and are used in more specialized applications. These include tung, poppyseed, perilla, and walnut oil. All &quot;polymerize&quot; on exposure to oxygen to form solid films, useful in paints and varnishes.

Triglycerides can also be split into methyl esters of the constituent fatty acids via transesterification: 
The resulting fatty acid methyl esters can be used as fuel in diesel engines, hence their name biodiesel.

== Staining ==
Staining for fatty acids, triglycerides, lipoproteins, and other lipids is done through the use of lysochromes (fat-soluble dyes). These dyes can allow the qualification of a certain fat of interest by staining the material a specific color. Some examples: Sudan IV, Oil Red O, and Sudan Black B.

<text>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion and occasionally loss of consciousness. A person&#x27;s breath may develop a specific &quot;fruity&quot; or acetone smell. The onset of symptoms is usually rapid. People without a previous diagnosis of diabetes may develop DKA as the first obvious symptom.

DKA happens most often in those with type 1 diabetes but can also occur in those with other types of diabetes under certain circumstances. Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response, the body switches to burning fatty acids, which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar, low blood pH and keto acids in either the blood or urine.

The primary treatment of DKA is with intravenous fluids and insulin. Depending on the severity, insulin may be given intravenously or by injection under the skin. Usually, potassium is also needed to prevent the development of low blood potassium. Throughout treatment, blood glucose and potassium levels should be regularly checked. Underlying causes for the DKA should be identified. In those with severely low blood pH who are critically ill, sodium bicarbonate may be given; however, its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended.

Rates of DKA vary around the world. Each year, about 4% of type 1 diabetics in the United Kingdom develop DKA, versus 25% of type 1 diabetics in Malaysia. DKA was first described in 1886 and continued to be a universally fatal condition until introduction of insulin therapy in the 1920s. With adequate and timely treatment today, the risk of death is between &lt;1% and 5%.

==History==
The first full description of diabetic ketoacidosis is attributed to Julius Dreschfeld, a German-British pathologist working in Manchester, United Kingdom. In his description, which he gave in an 1886 lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in London, he drew on reports by Adolf Kussmaul as well as describing the main ketones, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, and their chemical determination. The condition remained almost universally fatal until the discovery of insulin in the 1920s; by the 1930s, mortality had fallen to 29 percent, and by the 1950s it had become less than 10 percent. The entity of cerebral edema due to DKA was described in 1936 by a team of doctors from Philadelphia.

Numerous research studies since the 1950s have focused on the ideal treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis. A significant proportion of these studies have been conducted at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Emory University School of Medicine. Treatment options studied have included high- or low-dose intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular (e.g. the &quot;Alberti regime&quot;) insulin, potassium supplementation, need for a loading dose of insulin, and the appropriateness of using bicarbonate therapy in moderate DKA. Various questions remain unanswered, such as whether bicarbonate administration in severe DKA makes any real difference to the clinical course, and whether an insulin loading dose is needed in adults.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis usually evolve over a period of about 24 hours. Predominant symptoms are nausea and vomiting, pronounced thirst, excessive urine production and abdominal pain that may be severe. In severe DKA, breathing becomes rapid and of a deep, gasping character, called &quot;Kussmaul breathing&quot;. The abdomen may be tender to the point that a serious abdominal condition may be suspected, such as acute pancreatitis, appendicitis or gastrointestinal perforation. Vomiting altered blood that resembles coffee grounds occurs in a minority of people and tends to originate from erosion of the esophagus. In severe DKA, there may be confusion or a marked decrease in alertness, including coma.

On physical examination there is usually clinical evidence of dehydration, such as a dry mouth and decreased skin turgor. If the dehydration is profound enough to cause a decrease in the circulating blood volume, a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure may be observed. Often, a &quot;ketotic&quot; odor is present, which is often described as &quot;fruity&quot; or &quot;like pear drops&quot;. The smell is due to the presence of acetone. If Kussmaul respiration is present, this is reflected in an increased respiratory rate.

Small children with DKA are relatively prone to brain swelling, also called cerebral edema, which may cause headache, coma, loss of the pupillary light reflex, and can progress to death. It occurs in about 1 out of 100 children with DKA and more rarely occurs in adults.

==Cause==
DKA most frequently occurs in those who know that they have diabetes, but it may also be the first presentation in someone who has not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.

Diabetic ketoacidosis may occur in those previously known to have diabetes mellitus type 2 or in those who on further investigations turn out to have features of type 2 diabetes (e.g. obesity, strong family history); this is more common in African, African-American and Hispanic people. Their condition is then labeled &quot;ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes&quot;.

Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), which are generally used for type 2 diabetes, have been associated with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars may not be significantly elevated (&quot;euglycemic DKA&quot;). While this is a relatively uncommon adverse event, it is thought to be more common if someone receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor who is also receiving insulin has reduced or missed insulin doses. Furthermore, it can be triggered by severe acute illness, dehydration, extensive exercise, surgery, low-carbohydrate diets, or excessive alcohol intake. Proposed mechanisms for SGLT2-I induced &quot;euglycemic DKA&quot; include increased ketosis due to volume depletion combined with relative insulin deficiency and glucagon excess. SGLT2 inhibitors should be stopped before surgery and only recommenced when it is safe to do so. SGLT2 inhibitors may be used in people with type 1 diabetes, but the possibility of ketoacidosis requires specific risk management. Specifically, they should not be used if someone is also using a low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet.

==Mechanism==
Diabetic ketoacidosis arises because of a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen via glycogenolysis and also through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process known as osmotic diuresis. This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (lipolysis), which the liver converts into acetyl CoA through a process called beta oxidation. Acetyl CoA is metabolised into ketone bodies under severe states of energy deficiency, like starvation, through a process called ketogenesis, whose final products are aceto-acetate and β-Hydroxybutyrate. These ketone bodies can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pKa and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration.

In various situations such as infection, insulin demands rise but are not matched by the failing pancreas. Blood sugars rise, dehydration ensues, and resistance to the normal effects of insulin increases further by way of a vicious circle.

As a result of the above mechanisms, the average adult with DKA has a total body water shortage of about 6 liters (or 100 mL/kg), in addition to substantial shortages in sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, magnesium and calcium. Glucose levels usually exceed 13.8 mmol/L or 250 mg/dL.
DKA is common in type 1 diabetes as this form of diabetes is associated with an absolute lack of insulin production by the islets of Langerhans. In type 2 diabetes, insulin production is present but is insufficient to meet the body&#x27;s requirements as a result of end-organ insulin resistance. Usually, these amounts of insulin are sufficient to suppress ketogenesis. If DKA occurs in someone with type 2 diabetes, their condition is called &quot;ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes&quot;. The exact mechanism for this phenomenon is unclear, but there is evidence both of impaired insulin secretion and insulin action. Once the condition has been treated, insulin production resumes and often the person may be able to resume diet or tablet treatment as normally recommended in type 2 diabetes.

The clinical state of DKA is associated, in addition to the above, with the release of various counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon and adrenaline as well as cytokines, the latter of which leads to increased markers of inflammation, even in the absence of infection.

Cerebral edema, which is the most dangerous DKA complication, is probably the result of a number of factors. Some authorities suggest that it is the result of overvigorous fluid replacement, but the complication may develop before treatment has been commenced. It is more likely in those with more severe DKA, and in the first episode of DKA. Likely factors in the development of cerebral edema are dehydration, acidosis and low carbon dioxide levels; in addition, the increased level of inflammation and coagulation may, together with these factors, lead to decreased blood flow to parts of the brain, which then swells up once fluid replacement has been commenced. The swelling of brain tissue leads to raised intracranial pressure ultimately leading to death.

== Ketosis prone diabetes ==
The entity of ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes was first fully described in 1987 after several preceding case reports. It was initially thought to be a form of maturity onset diabetes of the young, and went through several other descriptive names (such as &quot;idiopathic type 1 diabetes&quot;, &quot;Flatbush diabetes&quot;, &quot;atypical diabetes&quot; and &quot;type 1.5 diabetes&quot;) before the current terminology of &quot;ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes&quot; was adopted.

It has been reported predominantly in non-white ethnicity in African–Americans, Hispanics, Black Africans and Black Caribbeans. There is a link with G6PD deficiency.

==Diagnosis==

===Investigations===
Diabetic ketoacidosis may be diagnosed when the combination of hyperglycemia (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on urinalysis and acidosis are demonstrated. In about 10% of cases the blood sugar is not significantly elevated (&quot;euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis&quot;).

A pH measurement is performed to detect acidosis. Blood from a vein is adequate, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH; arterial samples are only required if there are concerns about oxygen levels. Ketones can be measured in the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need for admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.

In addition to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA as a result of dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) and acute pancreatitis (amylase and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed.

If cerebral edema is suspected because of confusion, recurrent vomiting or other symptoms, computed tomography may be performed to assess its severity and to exclude other causes such as stroke.

===Criteria===
Diabetic ketoacidosis is distinguished from other diabetic emergencies by the presence of large amounts of ketones in blood and urine, and marked metabolic acidosis. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS, sometimes labeled &quot;hyperosmolar non-ketotic state&quot; or HONK) is much more common in type 2 diabetes and features increased plasma osmolarity (above 320 mosm/kg) due to profound dehydration and concentration of the blood; mild acidosis and ketonemia may occur in this state, but not to the extent observed in DKA. There is a degree of overlap between DKA and HHS, as in DKA the osmolarity may also be increased.

Ketoacidosis is not always the result of diabetes. It may also result from alcohol excess and from starvation; in both states the glucose level is normal or low. Metabolic acidosis may occur in people with diabetes for other reasons, such as poisoning with ethylene glycol or paraldehyde.

The American Diabetes Association categorizes DKA in adults into one of three stages of severity:
* &quot;Mild:&quot; blood pH mildly decreased to between 7.25 and 7.30 (normal 7.35–7.45); serum bicarbonate decreased to 15–18 mmol/L (normal above 20); the person is alert
* &quot;Moderate:&quot; pH 7.00–7.25, bicarbonate 10–15, mild drowsiness may be present
* &quot;Severe:&quot; pH below 7.00, bicarbonate below 10, stupor or coma may occur

A 2004 statement by the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society (for children) uses slightly different cutoffs, where mild DKA is defined by pH 7.20–7.30 (bicarbonate 10–15 mmol/L), moderate DKA by pH 7.1–7.2 (bicarbonate 5–10) and severe DKA by pH&lt;7.1 (bicarbonate below 5).

==Prevention==
Attacks of DKA can be prevented in those known to have diabetes to an extent by adherence to &quot;sick day rules&quot;; these are clear-cut instructions to patients on how to treat themselves when unwell. Instructions include advice on how much extra insulin to take when sugar levels appear uncontrolled, an easily digestible diet rich in salt and carbohydrates, means to suppress fever and treat infection, and recommendations on when to call for medical help.

People with diabetes can monitor their own ketone levels when unwell and seek help if they are elevated.

==Management==
The main aim in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis is to replace the lost fluids and electrolytes while suppressing the high blood sugars and ketone production with insulin. Admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar high-dependency area or ward for close observation may be necessary.

===Fluid replacement===
The amount of fluid replaced depends on the estimated degree of dehydration. If dehydration is so severe as to cause shock (severely decreased blood pressure with insufficient blood supply to the body&#x27;s organs), or a depressed level of consciousness, rapid infusion of saline (1 liter for adults, 10 mL/kg in repeated doses for children) is recommended to restore circulating volume. Slower rehydration based on calculated water and sodium shortage may be possible if the dehydration is moderate, and again saline is the recommended fluid. Very mild ketoacidosis with no associated vomiting and mild dehydration may be treated with oral rehydration and subcutaneous rather than intravenous insulin under observation for signs of deterioration.

Normal saline (0.9% saline) has generally been the fluid of choice. There have been a few small trials looking at balanced fluids with few differences.

A special but unusual consideration is cardiogenic shock, where the blood pressure is decreased not due to dehydration but due to the inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.

===Insulin===
Some guidelines recommend a bolus (initial large dose) of insulin of 0.1 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight. This can be administered immediately after the potassium level is known to be higher than 3.3 mmol/L; if the level is any lower, administering insulin could lead to a dangerously low potassium level (see below). Other guidelines recommend a bolus given intramuscularly if there is a delay in commencing an intravenous infusion of insulin, whereas guidelines for the management of pediatric DKA recommend delaying the initiation of insulin until fluids have been administered. It is possible to use rapid acting insulin analogs injections under the skin for mild or moderate cases.

In general, insulin is given at 0.1 units/kg per hour to reduce blood sugars and suppress ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which dose to use when blood sugar levels start falling; American guidelines recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) and UK guidelines at 14 mmol/L (253 mg/dL). Others recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.

===Potassium===
Potassium levels can fluctuate severely during the treatment of DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A large part of the shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3 mmol/L. If potassium levels fall below 3.3 mmol/L, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.

===Sodium bicarbonate===
The administration of sodium bicarbonate solution to rapidly improve the acid levels in the blood is controversial. There is little evidence that it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed some evidence that while it may improve the acidity of the blood, it may actually worsen acidity inside the body&#x27;s cells and increase the risk of certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged, although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH&lt;6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH 6.9–7.0).

===Cerebral edema===
Cerebral edema, if associated with coma, often necessitates admission to intensive care, artificial ventilation, and close observation. The administration of fluids is slowed. The ideal treatment of cerebral edema in DKA is not established, but intravenous mannitol and hypertonic saline (3%) are used—as in some other forms of cerebral edema—in an attempt to reduce the swelling. Cerebral edema is unusual in adults.

===Resolution===
Resolution of DKA is defined as the general improvement in the symptoms, such as the ability to tolerate oral nutrition and fluids, normalization of blood acidity (pH&gt;7.3), and absence of ketones in the blood (&lt;1 mmol/L) or urine. Once this has been achieved, insulin may be switched to the usual subcutaneously administered regimen, one hour after which the intravenous administration can be discontinued.

In people with suspected ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, determination of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase and islet cells may aid in the decision whether to continue insulin administration long-term (if antibodies are detected), or whether to withdraw insulin and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 diabetes. Generally speaking, routine measurement of C-peptide as a measure of insulin production is not recommended unless there is genuine doubt as to whether someone has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

==Epidemiology==
Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs in 4.6–8.0 per 1000 people with diabetes annually. Rates among those with type 1 diabetes are higher with about 4% in the United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually as a result of DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to half the total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend in hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA. Lower socio‐economic status and higher area‐level deprivation are associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in people with diabetes mellitus type 1.

Previously considered universally fatal, the risk of death with adequate and timely treatment is between &lt;1% and 5%. Up to 1% of children with DKA develop a complication known as cerebral edema. Rates of cerebral edema in US children with DKA have risen from 0.4% in 2002 to 0.7% in 2012. Between 2 and 5 out of 10 children who develop brain swelling will die as a result.

<text>Galactose (, &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, &quot;milk sugar&quot;), sometimes abbreviated Gal, is a monosaccharide sugar that is about as sweet as glucose, and about 65% as sweet as sucrose. It is an aldohexose and a C-4 epimer of glucose. A galactose molecule linked with a glucose molecule forms a lactose molecule.

Galactan is a polymeric form of galactose found in hemicellulose, and forming the core of the galactans, a class of natural polymeric carbohydrates.

D-Galactose is also known as brain sugar since it is a component of glycoproteins (oligosaccharide-protein compounds) found in nerve tissue.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;galactose&quot; was coined by Charles Weissman in the mid-19th century and is derived from Greek &quot;γαλακτος&quot;, &quot;galaktos,&quot; (of milk) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars &quot;-ose&quot;. The etymology is comparable to that of the word &quot;lactose&quot; in that both contain roots meaning &quot;milk sugar&quot;. Lactose is a disaccharide of galactose plus glucose.

==Structure and isomerism==
Galactose exists in both open-chain and cyclic form. The open-chain form has a carbonyl at the end of the chain.

Four isomers are cyclic, two of them with a pyranose (six-membered) ring, two with a furanose (five-membered) ring. Galactofuranose occurs in bacteria, fungi and protozoa, and is recognized by a putative chordate immune lectin intelectin through its exocyclic 1,2-diol. In the cyclic form there are two anomers, named alpha and beta, since the transition from the open-chain form to the cyclic form involves the creation of a new stereocenter at the site of the open-chain carbonyl.

The IR spectra for galactose shows a broad, strong stretch from roughly wavenumber 2500 cm−1 to wavenumber 3700 cm−1.

The Proton NMR spectra for galactose includes peaks at 4.7 ppm (D2O), 4.15 ppm (−CH2OH), 3.75, 3.61, 3.48 and 3.20 ppm (−CH2 of ring), 2.79–1.90 ppm (−OH).


==Relationship to lactose==
Galactose is a monosaccharide. When combined with glucose (another monosaccharide) through a condensation reaction, the result is a disaccharide called lactose. The hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose is catalyzed by the enzymes lactase and β-galactosidase. The latter is produced by the &quot;lac&quot; operon in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

In nature, lactose is found primarily in milk and milk products. Consequently, various food products made with dairy-derived ingredients can contain lactose. Galactose metabolism, which converts galactose into glucose, is carried out by the three principal enzymes in a mechanism known as the Leloir pathway. The enzymes are listed in the order of the metabolic pathway: galactokinase (GALK), galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), and UDP-galactose-4’-epimerase (GALE).

In human lactation, galactose is required in a 1 to 1 ratio with glucose to enable the mammary glands to synthesize and secrete lactose. In a study where women were fed a diet containing galactose, 69 ± 6% of glucose and 54 ± 4% of galactose in the lactose they produced were derived directly from plasma glucose, while 7 ± 2% of the glucose and 12 ± 2% of the galactose in the lactose, were derived directly from plasma galactose. 25 ± 8% of the glucose and 35 ± 6% of the galactose was synthesized from smaller molecules such as glycerol or acetate in a process referred to in the paper as hexoneogenesis. This suggests that the synthesis of galactose is supplemented by direct uptake and of use of plasma galactose when present.

==Metabolism==
Glucose is more stable than galactose and is less susceptible to the formation of nonspecific glycoconjugates, molecules with at least one sugar attached to a protein or lipid. Many speculate that it is for this reason that a pathway for rapid conversion from galactose to glucose has been highly conserved among many species.

The main pathway of galactose metabolism is the Leloir pathway; humans and other species, however, have been noted to contain several alternate pathways, such as the De Ley Doudoroff Pathway. The Leloir pathway consists of the latter stage of a two-part process that converts β-D-galactose to UDP-glucose. The initial stage is the conversion of β-D-galactose to α-D-galactose by the enzyme, mutarotase (GALM). The Leloir pathway then carries out the conversion of α-D-galactose to UDP-glucose via three principal enzymes: Galactokinase (GALK) phosphorylates α-D-galactose to galactose-1-phosphate, or Gal-1-P; Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) transfers a UMP group from UDP-glucose to Gal-1-P to form UDP-galactose; and finally, UDP galactose-4’-epimerase (GALE) interconverts UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose, thereby completing the pathway.

The above mechanisms for galactose metabolism are necessary because the human body cannot directly convert galactose into energy, and must first go through one of these processes in order to utilize the sugar.

Galactosemia is an inability to properly break down galactose due to a genetically inherited mutation in one of the enzymes in the Leloir pathway. As a result, the consumption of even small quantities is harmful to galactosemics.

==Sources==
Galactose is found in dairy products, avocados, sugar beets, other gums and mucilages. It is also synthesized by the body, where it forms part of glycolipids and glycoproteins in several tissues; and is a by-product from the third-generation ethanol production process (from macroalgae).

==Clinical significance==
Chronic systemic exposure of mice, rats, and &quot;Drosophila&quot; to D-galactose causes the acceleration of senescence (aging). It has been reported that high dose exposure of D-galactose (120 mg/kg) can cause reduced sperm concentration and sperm motility in rodents and has been extensively used as an aging model when administered subcutaneously.
Two studies have suggested a possible link between galactose in milk and ovarian cancer. Other studies show no correlation, even in the presence of defective galactose metabolism. More recently, pooled analysis done by the Harvard School of Public Health showed no specific correlation between lactose-containing foods and ovarian cancer, and showed statistically insignificant increases in risk for consumption of lactose at 30 g/day. More research is necessary to ascertain possible risks.

Some ongoing studies suggest galactose may have a role in treatment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (a kidney disease resulting in kidney failure and proteinuria). This effect is likely to be a result of binding of galactose to FSGS factor.

Galactose is a component of the antigens (chemical markers) present on blood cells that distinguish blood type within the ABO blood group system. In O and A antigens, there are two monomers of galactose on the antigens, whereas in the B antigens there are three monomers of galactose.

A disaccharide composed of two units of galactose, galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal), has been recognized as a potential allergen present in mammal meat. Alpha-gal allergy may be triggered by lone star tick bites.

Galactose in sodium saccharin solution has also been found to cause conditioned flavor avoidance in adult female rats within a laboratory setting when combined with intragastric injections. The reason for this flavor avoidance is still unknown, however it is possible that a decrease in the levels of the enzymes required to convert galactose to glucose in the liver of the rats could be responsible.

== History ==

In 1855, E. O. Erdmann noted that hydrolysis of lactose produced a substance besides glucose.

Galactose was first isolated and studied by Louis Pasteur in 1856 and he called it &quot;lactose&quot;. In 1860, Berthelot renamed it &quot;galactose&quot; or &quot;glucose lactique&quot;. In 1894, Emil Fischer and Robert Morrell determined the configuration of galactose.

<text>Retinopathy is any damage to the retina of the eyes, which may cause vision impairment. Retinopathy often refers to retinal vascular disease, or damage to the retina caused by abnormal blood flow. Age-related macular degeneration is technically included under the umbrella term retinopathy but is often discussed as a separate entity. Retinopathy, or retinal vascular disease, can be broadly categorized into proliferative and non-proliferative types. Frequently, retinopathy is an ocular manifestation of systemic disease as seen in diabetes or hypertension. Diabetes is the most common cause of retinopathy in the U.S. as of 2008. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-aged people. It accounts for about 5% of blindness worldwide and is designated a priority eye disease by the World Health Organization.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Many people often do not have symptoms until very late in their disease course. Patients often become symptomatic when there is irreversible damage. Symptoms are usually not painful and can include:
* Vitreous hemorrhage
* Floaters, or small objects that drift through the field of vision
* Decreased visual acuity
* &quot;Curtain falling&quot; over eyes

==Pathophysiology==
The development of retinopathy can be broken down into proliferative and non-proliferative types. Both types cause disease by altering the normal blood flow to the retina through different mechanisms. The retina is supplied by small vessel branches from the central retinal artery. Proliferative retinopathy refers to damage caused by abnormal blood vessel growth. Normally, angiogenesis is a natural part of tissue growth and formation. When there is an unusually high or fast rate of angiogenesis, there is an overgrowth of blood vessels called neovascularization. In the non-proliferative type, abnormal blood flow to the retina occurs due to direct damage or compromise of the blood vessels themselves. Many causes of retinopathy may cause both proliferative and non-proliferative types, though some causes are more associated one type.

=== Non-proliferative retinopathy ===
Non-proliferative retinopathy is often caused by direct damage or remodeling of the small blood vessels supplying the retina. Many common causes of non-proliferative damage include hypertensive retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, radiation retinopathy, solar retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy, and anemic retinopathy (including secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency).

There are three main mechanisms of damage in non-proliferative retinopathy: blood vessel damage or remodeling, direct retinal damage, or occlusion of the blood vessels. The first mechanism is indirect damage by altering the blood vessels that supply the retina. In the case of hypertension, high pressures in the system cause the walls of the artery to thicken, which effectively reduces the amount of blood flow to the retina. This reduction in flow causes tissue ischemia leading to damage. Atherosclerosis, or hardening and narrowing of blood vessels, also reduces flow to the retina. The second mechanism is direct damage to the retina usually caused by free radicals that causes oxidative damage to the retina itself. Radiation, solar retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity fall under this category. The third common mechanism is occlusion of blood flow. This can be caused by either physically blocking the vessels of the retinal artery branches or causing the arteries to narrow. Again, the result is reduced blood flow to the retina causing tissue damage. Sickle cell disease compromises blood flow by causing blood to sludge, or thicken and flow slowly, through the retinal arteries. Other disorders that cause hyperviscosity syndrome may also cause blood sludging. Lastly, clots or central artery thrombosis directly blocks flow to the retina causing the cells to die.

=== Proliferative retinopathy ===
Proliferative retinopathy is the result of aberrant blood flow to the retina due to blood vessel overgrowth, or neovascularization. These pathologically overgrown blood vessels are often fragile, weak, and ineffective at perfusing the retinal tissues. These weak, fragile vessels are also often leaky, allowing fluids, protein, and other debris to leach out into the retina. They are also prone to hemorrhage due to their poor strength. This makes proliferative types of retinopathy more risky since vessel hemorrhaging often leads to vision loss and blindness. Many of the causes mentioned in non-proliferative retinopathy may also cause proliferative retinopathy at later stages. Angiogenesis and neovascularization tend to be a later manifestation of non-proliferative retinopathy. Many types of non-proliferative retinopathies result in tissue ischemia or direct retinal damage. The body responds by trying to increase blood flow to damaged retinal tissues. Diabetes mellitus, which causes diabetic retinopathy, is the most common cause of proliferative retinopathy in the world.

=== Other causes ===
Genetic mutations are rare causes of certain retinopathies and are usually X-linked including &quot;NDP&quot; family of genes causing Norrie disease, FEVR, and Coats disease among others. There is emerging evidence that there may be a genetic predisposition in patients who develop retinopathy of prematurity and diabetic retinopathy. Trauma, especially to the head, and several diseases may cause Purtscher&#x27;s retinopathy. Physical exertion like weight lifting and aerobic exercise, coughing, sneezing, straining at stool, vomiting, sexual intercourse, blowing up balloons, blowing musical instruments, cardiopulmonary resuscitation or compression injuries may cause valsalva retinopathy.

== Diagnosis ==
Retinopathy is diagnosed by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist during eye examination. The clinician will need to examine the retina, at the back of the eye, to make this diagnosis. There are several ways to examine the retina. The clinician can directly view the retina by looking through the pupil with a light. In most cases, the clinician will dilate the pupil to make for better visualization. Stereoscopic fundus photography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of retinopathy.

==Access to care==
Telemedicine programs are available that allow primary care clinics to take images using specially designed retinal imaging equipment which can then be shared electronically with specialists at other locations for review. In 2009, Community Health Center, Inc. implemented a telemedicine retinal screening program for low-income patients with diabetes as part of those patients&#x27; annual visits at the Federally Qualified Health Center.

==Prevention==
Retinopathy is often secondary to diseases such as diabetes or hypertension. Controlling blood sugar levels and blood pressure have been shown to help decrease incidence of retinopathy.

Blood sugar control: If someone has diabetes, or is at high risk for diabetes, it is important for them to have their blood sugar levels checked. The gold standard blood sugar test is the HbA1C test. Many studies have suggested that lowering HbA1C levels in someone with elevated HbA1C levels can lower the incidence and progression of retinopathy. Fortunately, blood sugar control can have benefits beyond just the eye. A primary care physician can help with blood sugar control strategies.

Blood pressure control: Controlling blood pressure can also lower the incidence and progression of retinopathy. A primary care physician can help with blood pressure control strategies.

Other: Besides blood sugar and blood pressure control, there are other modifications that can help. Regular exercise may help lower the incidence and progression of retinopathy. If someone has sleep apnea, treatment of sleep apnea may help as well.

==Treatment==
Treatment is based on the cause of the retinopathy and may include laser therapy to the retina. Laser photocoagulation therapy has been the standard treatment for many types of retinopathy. Evidence shows that laser therapy is generally safe and improves visual symptoms in sickle cell and diabetic retinopathy. In recent years targeting the pathway controlling vessel growth or angiogenesis has been promising. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) seems to play a vital role in promoting neovascularization. Using anti-VEGF drugs (antibodies to sequester the growth factor), research have shown significant reduction in the extent of vessel outgrowth. Low quality evidence supports the use of anti-VEGF antibodies, such as bevacizumab or pegaptanib which seems to improve outcomes when used in conjunction with laser therapy to treat retinopathy of prematurity, longer term systemic effects are not known however. The evidence is poorer for treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Use of anti-VEGF drugs did not appear to improve outcomes in a clinically significant way when compared to standard laser therapy for diabetic retinopathy.

== Epidemiology ==
The two most common causes of retinopathy include diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. Diabetic retinopathy affects about 5 million people and retinopathy of prematurity affect about 50,000 premature infants each year worldwide. Hypertensive retinopathy is the next most common cause affecting anywhere from 3 to 14% of all non-diabetic adults.

<text>Diabetic retinopathy (also known as diabetic eye disease) is a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes. It is a leading cause of blindness in developed countries and one of the lead causes of sight loss in the world, even though there are many new therapies and improved treatments for helping people live with diabetes.

Diabetic retinopathy affects up to 80 percent of those who have had both type 1 and type 2 diabetes for 20 years or more. In at least 90% of new cases, progression to more aggressive forms of sight threatening retinopathy and maculopathy could be reduced with proper treatment and monitoring of the eyes. The longer a person has diabetes, the higher his or her chances of developing diabetic retinopathy. Each year in the United States, diabetic retinopathy accounts for 12% of all new cases of blindness. It is also the leading cause of blindness in people aged 20 to 64.

==Signs and symptoms==

Nearly all people with diabetes develop some degree of retina damage (&quot;retinopathy&quot;) over several decades with the disease. For many, that damage can only be detected by a retinal exam, and has no noticeable effect on vision. Over time, progressive retinal damage may appear on a retinal exam, first with small bulges in retinal blood vessels called microaneurysms. Then larger abnormalities in retinal vessels: cotton wool spots, hemorrhages, lipid deposits called &quot;hard exudates&quot;, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, and abnormal-looking retinal veins. Eventually, many progress to a stage where new blood vessels grow throughout the retina. These new blood vessels often break and bleed. Minor bleeding can cause dark floating spots obstructing vision; major bleeding can completely block vision.

Around half of people with diabetic retinopathy develop swelling of the macula, called macular edema, which can begin at any time. If the swelling occurs near the center of the macula, it can cause vision disruptions ranging from mildly blurred vision to severe loss of the center of an affected person&#x27;s visual field. Left untreated, around 30% of those with such swelling experience vision disruption over the next 3–5 years. Macular edema is the most common cause of vision loss in people with diabetic retinopathy.

The repeated processes of blood vessel growth, swelling, and scarring can eventually cause retinal detachment, which manifests as the sudden appearance of dark floating spots, flashes of light, or blurred vision.

==Diagnosis and classification==
Diabetic retinopathy is typically diagnosed by retinal exam observations using ophthalmoscopy. The American Academy of Ophthalmology divides diabetic retinopathy into five categories of progressive severity. The first category, &quot;no apparent retinopathy&quot;, describes those with a healthy retinal exam. The next three categories: mild, moderate, and severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) describe increasing levels of damage to the retina. People with mild NPDR have microaneurysms in the retina, but no other damage. Those with severe NPDR have 20+ retinal hemorrhages in each quadrant of the retina, a distinctive pattern of damage on the veins of the retina called &quot;venous beading&quot; in at least two retinal quadrants, and obvious intraretinal microvascular abnormalities anywhere on the retina. Moderate NPDR is defined as more severe than mild NPDR, but not yet meeting the criteria for severe NPDR. The fifth stage, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, is for those with new blood vessels forming throughout the retina (&quot;retinal neovascularization&quot;), or blood leaking into the vitreous humor (&quot;vitreous hemorrhage&quot;) or between the vitreous membrane and retina (&quot;preretinal hemorrhage&quot;).

The same guidelines separately divide macular edema into two categories: &quot;macular edema apparently absent&quot; and &quot;macular edema apparently present&quot;. The latter is further subdivided into &quot;mild&quot;—retinal thickening or lipid deposits far from the macula&#x27;s center; &quot;moderate&quot;— thickening or deposits near the center; and &quot;severe&quot;—thickening or deposits on the macula center. Optical coherence tomography is frequently used to assess macular edema.

Fluorescein angiography is used by retina specialists to further assess diabetic retinopathy severity and to determine sites of macular damage.

===Screening===
Due to the lack of symptoms, most people with diabetic retinopathy are unaware that they have the condition until they visit an eye doctor. Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the International Council of Ophthalmology (ICO) recommend regular eye exams for those with diabetes to screen for diabetic retinopathy (except those with gestational diabetes). The ADA recommends a comprehensive eye examination at the time of type 2 diabetes diagnosis, and within five years of the onset of type 1 diabetes. For women with diabetes who become pregnant, the ADA recommends an eye examination before pregnancy, in each trimester, and for a year post partum. The ICO recommends eye examinations for those with diabetes include a visual acuity examination and a retinal examination via ophthalmoscopy or retinal photography.

Iceland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom are the only countries with full national diabetic retinopathy screening programs, while substantial regional screening programs have been implemented in parts of mainland Europe, parts of Asia, and Botswana. In the UK, screening for diabetic retinopathy is part of the standard of care for people with diabetes. After one normal screening in people with diabetes, further screening is recommended every year. Teleophthalmology has been employed in these programs.

==Causes==
Diabetic retinopathy is caused by prolonged high blood glucose damaging the small blood vessels of the retina, though the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Progression of diabetic retinopathy is accompanied by loss of capillary cells, increased blood vessel permeability in the retina, and altered retinal blood flow, all of which can reduce the amount of blood oxygen that gets delivered to the retina. Poor oxygenation of tissues drives the formation of new blood vessels throughout the retina, resulting in the proliferative stage of disease. These new blood vessels tend to rupture easily, causing bleeding within the eye, scarring, and damage to the retina or macula. Recent evidences have found a strong association between diabetic retinopathy and inflammation.

===Risk factors===
The major risk factors for developing diabetic retinopathy are duration of diabetes, poor blood sugar control, and to a lesser extent high blood pressure. Five years after diabetes diagnosis, around 25% of those with type 1 diabetes have some degree of diabetic retinopathy, while 2% have proliferative diabetic retinopathy. By 15 years after diagnosis, that increases to 80% with some retinopathy, and 25% with proliferative disease. Children are an exception—regardless of duration of diabetes, children rarely experience sight-threatening retinopathy; however, puberty can accelerate retinopathy progression. Pregnancy can also accelerate the progression of diabetic retinopathy (although women with gestational diabetes are not at risk).

Both chronically high blood sugar (measured by a high HbA1c) and highly variable blood sugar are associated with developing diabetic retinopathy. Several more minor risk factors also exacerbate diabetic retinopathy, namely kidney disease, abnormal blood lipids, high body mass index, and smoking.

Genetic predisposition to diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes consists of many genetic variants across the genome that are collectively associated with diabetic retinopathy (polygenic risk) and overlaps with genetic risk for glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. Several variations in the &quot;VEGFC&quot; gene have also been associated with an increased risk of developing macular edema.

People with Down syndrome, who have extra chromosome 21 material, almost never acquire diabetic retinopathy. This protection appears to be due to the elevated levels of endostatin, an anti-angiogenic protein, derived from collagen XVIII. The collagen XVIII gene is located on chromosome 21.

Incidence of Retinitis Pigmentosa is observed to result in fewer and less severe microvascular lesions in both humans and mouse models. Retinitis Pigmentosa results in loss of rod receptors in the mid peripheral field, reducing the oxygen consumption that is linked with release of VEGF and growth of unwanted blood vessels in the retina.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with a higher incidence of diabetic eye disease due to blood desaturation caused by intermittent upper airway obstructions. Treatment for OSA can help reduce the risk of diabetic complications.

==Pathogenesis==

Diabetic retinopathy is the result of damage to the small blood vessels and neurons of the retina. The earliest changes leading to diabetic retinopathy include narrowing of the retinal arteries associated with reduced retinal blood flow; dysfunction of the neurons of the inner retina, followed in later stages by changes in the function of the outer retina, associated with subtle changes in visual function; dysfunction of the blood-retinal barrier, which protects the retina from many substances in the blood (including toxins and immune cells), leading to the leaking of blood constituents into the retinal neuropile. Later, the basement membrane of the retinal blood vessels thickens, capillaries degenerate and lose cells, particularly pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. This leads to loss of blood flow and progressive ischemia, and microscopic aneurysms which appear as balloon-like structures jutting out from the capillary walls, which recruit inflammatory cells; and advanced dysfunction and degeneration of the neurons and glial cells of the retina. The condition typically develops about 10–15 years after receiving the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

An experimental study suggests that pericyte death is caused by blood glucose persistently activating protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which, through a series of intermediates, inhibits signaling through platelet-derived growth factor receptors—signaling that supports cellular survival, proliferation, and growth. The resulting withdrawal of this signaling leads to the programmed cell death (apoptosis) of the cells in this experimental model.

In addition, excessive sorbitol in diabetics is deposited on retina tissue and it is also proposed to play a role in diabetic retinopathy.

Recent studies have found a strong correlation between retinal inflammation and diabetic retinopathy progression.

A genetic study showed that diabetic retinopathy shares a similar genetic predisposition with levels of glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure, indicating that glycemic control and cardiometabolic factors may be important in the development of diabetic retinopathy.

Lipid peroxidation plays a notable role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Free radicals such as hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl species with oxygen as functional group oxidize lipids and phospholipids, and at cellular level bring about membrane lipid peroxidation and in this way can trigger diabetic retinopathy.

==Management==
There are four common treatments for diabetic retinopathy: anti-VEGF injections, steroid injections, panretinal laser photocoagulation, and vitrectomy. Current treatment regimens can prevent 90% of severe vision loss.

Although these treatments are very successful (in slowing or stopping further vision loss), they do not cure diabetic retinopathy. Caution should be exercised in treatment with laser surgery since it causes a loss of retinal tissue. It is often more prudent to inject triamcinolone or anti-VEGF drugs. In some patients it results in a marked increase of vision, especially if there is an edema of the macula.

In addition, standard treatment for diabetic retinopathy includes improving control of blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol, all of which can reduce diabetic retinopathy progression.

===Mild or moderate NPDR===
For those with mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends only more frequent retinal exams—every six to twelve months—as these people are at an increased risk of developing proliferative retinopathy or macular edema. Injection of anti-VEGF drugs or steroids can reduce diabetic retinopathy progression in around half of eyes treated; however, whether this results in improved vision long term is not yet known. The lipid-lowering drug fenofibrate also reduces progression of disease in people with mild to moderate disease.

===Diabetic macular edema===
Those at highest risk of vision loss – that is, with edema near the center of the macula – benefit most from eye injections of anti-VEGF therapies aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab. There is no widely accepted dosing schedule, though people typically receive more frequent injections during the first year of treatment, with less frequent injections in subsequent years sufficient to maintain remission. Those whose eyes don&#x27;t improve with anti-VEGF therapy may instead receive laser photocoagulation, typically in the form of short laser pulses.
Those with macular edema but no vision loss do not benefit from treatment; the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends deferring treatment until visual acuity falls to at least 20/30. The diabetic macular edema manifestation is difficult to predict. Autoantibodies against hexokinase 1 are commonly associated with diabetic macular edema manifestation. Nearly one-third of patients with diabetic macular edema were found to be positive for anti-hexokinase 1 autoantibodies. Importantly, these autoantibodies were rare in patients with diabetic retinopathy only or diabetes mellitus only. However, these autoantibodies fail to predict disease onset. They likely manifest secondary to the tissue-damaging stimulus at diabetic macular edema onset and cannot be used to predict diabetic macular edema before its onset.

===Laser photocoagulation===
Laser photocoagulation can be used in two scenarios for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Firstly, to treat macular edema and secondly, for treating whole retina (panretinal photocoagulation) for controlling neovascularization. It is widely used for early stages of proliferative retinopathy. There are different types of lasers and there is evidence available on their benefits to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

====Panretinal laser photocoagulation====
For those with proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, vision loss can be prevented by treatment with panretinal laser photocoagulation.

The goal is to create 1,600–2,000 burns in the retina with the hope of reducing the retina&#x27;s oxygen demand, and hence the possibility of ischemia. It is done in multiple sittings.

In treating advanced diabetic retinopathy, the burns are used to destroy the abnormal new blood vessels that form in the retina. This has been shown to reduce the risk of severe vision loss for eyes at risk by 50%.

Before using the laser, the ophthalmologist dilates the pupil and applies anaesthetic drops to numb the eye. In some cases, the doctor also may numb the area behind the eye to reduce discomfort. The patient sits facing the laser machine while the doctor holds a special lens on the eye. The physician can use a single spot laser, a pattern scan laser for two dimensional patterns such as squares, rings and arcs, or a navigated laser which works by tracking retinal eye movements in real time. During the procedure, the patient will see flashes of light. These flashes often create an uncomfortable stinging sensation for the patient. After the laser treatment, patients should be advised not to drive for a few hours while the pupils are still dilated. Vision will most likely remain blurry for the rest of the day. Though there should not be much pain in the eye itself, an ice-cream headache like pain may last for hours afterwards.

Patients will lose some of their peripheral vision after this surgery although it may be barely noticeable by the patient. The procedure does however save the center of the patient&#x27;s sight. Laser surgery may also slightly reduce colour and night vision.

A person with proliferative retinopathy will always be at risk for new bleeding, as well as glaucoma, a complication from the new blood vessels. This means that multiple treatments may be required to protect vision.

===Medications===
====Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide====
Triamcinolone is a long acting steroid preparation. Treating people with DME with intravitreal injections of triamcinolone may lead to a some degree of improvement in visual acuity when compared to eyes treated with placebo injections. When injected in the vitreous cavity, the steroid decreases the macular edema (thickening of the retina at the macula) caused due to diabetic maculopathy, and that may result in an increase in visual acuity. The effect of triamcinolone is not permanent and may last up to three months, which necessitates repeated injections for maintaining the beneficial effect. Best results of intravitreal Triamcinolone have been found in eyes that have already undergone cataract surgery. Complications of intravitreal injection of triamcinolone may include cataract, steroid-induced glaucoma, and endophthalmitis.

====Intravitreal anti-VEGF====

Aflibercept may have advantages in improving visual outcomes over bevacizumab and ranibizumab, after one year, longer term advantages are unclear In cases with vitreous hemorrhage, however, anti-VEGF injections proved to be less effective in restoring visual acuity than vitrectomy combined with panretinal laser-photocoagulation.

==== Other ====
Fenofibrate, a drug that is also used to reduce cholesterol levels, has been studied for its role in helping to improve the negative effects caused by diabetes and reducing the occurrence of retinal inflammation. There is some evidence that overall, in people with type II diabetes, fenofibrate may not make a clinically significant difference in progression of DME. For people who have type II diabetes and have overt retinopathy, there is evidence that fenofibrate may be more effective at reducing the progression of retinal damage.

===Surgery===
Instead of laser surgery, some people require a vitrectomy to restore vision. A vitrectomy is performed when there is a lot of blood in the vitreous. It involves removing the cloudy vitreous and replacing it with a saline solution.

Studies show that people who have a vitrectomy soon after a large hemorrhage are more likely to protect their vision than someone who waits to have the operation. Early vitrectomy is especially effective in people with insulin-dependent diabetes, who may be at greater risk of blindness from a hemorrhage into the eye.

Vitrectomy may be done under general or local anesthesia. The doctor makes a tiny incision in the sclera, or white of the eye. Next, a small instrument is placed into the eye to remove the vitreous and insert the saline solution into the eye.

Patients may be able to return home soon after the vitrectomy, or may be asked to stay in the hospital overnight. After the operation, the eye will be red and sensitive, and patients usually need to wear an eyepatch for a few days or weeks to protect the eye. Medicated eye drops are also prescribed to protect against infection. There is evidence which suggests anti-VEGF drugs given either prior to or during vitrectomy may reduce the risk of posterior vitreous cavity haemorrhage . Vitrectomy is frequently combined with other modalities of treatment.

==Epidemiology==
Around 35% of people with diabetes have some kind of diabetic retinopathy; around 10% experience some degree of vision loss. Diabetic retinopathy is particularly common in those with type 1 diabetes – affecting 25% of people five years from diagnosis, 60% 10 years from diagnosis, and 80% 15 years from diagnosis. Chances of disease progression are heavily influenced by blood sugar control, but on average 7% of those with diabetes experiencing proliferative diabetic retinopathy and 7% diabetic macular edema. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision loss in those 20–74 years old.

The global burden of diabetic retinopathy increased dramatically from 1990 to 2015—from 1.4 million to 2.6 million people with visual impairment; from 0.2 million to 0.4 million blinded—due in large part to the increasing burden of type 2 diabetes in low- and middle-income countries.

==Research==
Several large multicenter randomized clinical trials have been done to evaluate treatment protocols for those with diabetic retinopathy, namely the Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study, Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study, Diabetic Retinopathy Study, Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, UK Prospective Diabetes Study, and the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network Protocols I, S, and T.

=== Light treatment ===
A medical device comprising a mask that delivers green light through the eyelids while a person sleeps was under development in 2016. The light from the mask stops rod cells in the retina from dark adapting, which is thought to reduce their oxygen requirement, which in turn diminishes new blood vessel formation and thus prevents diabetic retinopathy. As of 2016 a large clinical trial was underway. As of 2018, the results from the clinical trial showed no long-term therapeutic benefit from using the mask in diabetic retinopathy patients.

===C-peptide===
C-peptide had shown promising results in treatment of diabetic complications incidental to vascular degeneration. Creative Peptides, Eli Lilly, and Cebix all had drug development programs for a C-peptide product. Cebix had the only ongoing program until it completed a Phase IIb trial in December 2014 that showed no difference between C-peptide and placebo, and it terminated its program and went out of business.

===Stem cell therapy===
Clinical trials are under way or are being populated in preparation for study at medical centers in Brazil, Iran and the United States. Current trials involve using the patients&#x27; own stem cells derived from bone marrow and injected into the degenerated areas in an effort to regenerate the vascular system.

===Blood pressure control===
A Cochrane review examined 29 randomized controlled trials to determine whether interventions that sought to control or reduce blood pressure in diabetics had any effects of diabetic retinopathy. While the results showed that interventions to control or reduce blood pressure prevented diabetic retinopathy for up to 4–5 years in diabetics, there was no evidence of any effect of these interventions on progression of diabetic retinopathy, preservation of visual acuity, adverse events, quality of life, and costs.

=== Fundoscopic image analyses ===

Diabetic retinopathy is diagnosed entirely by recognizing abnormalities on retinal images taken by fundoscopy. Color fundus photography is mainly used for staging the disease. Fluorescein angiography is used to assess the extent of retinopathy that aids in treatment plan development. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to determine the severity of edema and treatment response.

Because fundoscopic images are the main sources for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, manually analyzing those images can be time-consuming and unreliable, as the ability of detecting abnormalities varies by years of experience. Therefore, scientists have explored developing computer-aided diagnosis approaches to automate the process, which involves extracting information about the blood vessels and any abnormal patterns from the rest of the fundoscopic image and analyzing them.

<doc id="56538" wikidata="Q1398821" url="?curid=56538" title="Rule of thumb">
<text>In English, the phrase rule of thumb refers to an approximate method for doing something, based on practical experience rather than theory. This usage of the phrase can be traced back to the 17th century and has been associated with various trades where quantities were measured by comparison to the width or length of a thumb.

The phrase &quot;rule of thumb&quot; has also become linked to domestic abuse, with this usage first being seen in the late 1970s, when an author mentioned the idiom in an article but did not say that there was any such legal rule. After this, an incorrect belief that there was an actual legal rule has spread. The error appeared in a number of law journals, and the United States Commission on Civil Rights published a report on domestic abuse titled &quot;Under the Rule of Thumb&quot; in 1982. Some efforts were made to discourage the phrase, which was seen as taboo owing to this false origin. During the 1990s, several authors correctly identified the spurious folk etymology; however, the connection to domestic violence was still being cited in some legal sources into the early 2000s.

== Origin and usage ==
The exact origin of the phrase is uncertain. Its earliest (1685) appearance in print comes from a posthumously published collection of sermons by Scottish preacher James Durham: &quot;Many profest Christians are like to foolish builders, who build by guess, and by rule of thumb (as we use to speak), and not by Square and Rule.&quot;

The phrase is also found in Sir William Hope&#x27;s &quot;The Compleat Fencing Master&quot; (1692): &quot;What he doth, he doth by rule of Thumb, and not by Art.&quot; James Kelly&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Collection of Scottish Proverbs&quot;, 1721, includes: &quot;No Rule so good as Rule of Thumb, if it hit&quot;, meaning a practical approximation.

Historically, the width of the thumb, or &quot;thumb&#x27;s breadth&quot;, was used as the equivalent of an inch in the cloth trade; similar expressions existed in Latin and French as well. The thumb has also been used in brewing beer, to gauge the heat of the brewing vat. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer writes that &quot;rule of thumb&quot; means a &quot;rough measurement&quot;. He says that &quot;Ladies often measure yard lengths by their thumb. Indeed, the expression &#x27;sixteen nails make a yard&#x27; seems to point to the thumb-nail as a standard&quot; and that &quot;Countrymen always measure by their thumb.&quot; According to &quot;Phrasefinder&quot;, &quot;The phrase joins the whole nine yards as one that probably derives from some form of measurement but which is unlikely ever to be definitively pinned down.&quot;

== Folk etymology ==
A modern folk etymology holds that the phrase is derived from the maximum width of a stick allowed for wife-beating under English common law, but no such law has ever existed. This belief may have originated in a rumored statement by 18th-century judge Sir Francis Buller that a man may beat his wife with a stick no wider than his thumb. Despite there being no record that Buller ever said this, the rumor produced numerous jokes and satirical cartoons at his expense, with Buller being ridiculed as &quot;Judge Thumb&quot;.

English jurist Sir William Blackstone wrote in his &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; of an &quot;old law&quot; that once allowed &quot;moderate&quot; beatings by husbands, but he did not mention thumbs or any specific implements. Wife-beating has been officially outlawed for centuries in England and the United States, but continued in practice; several 19th-century American court rulings referred to an &quot;ancient doctrine&quot; that the judges believed had allowed husbands to physically punish their wives using implements no thicker than their thumbs. However, this belief was not connected with the phrase &quot;rule of thumb&quot; until the 1970s.

In the 1970s, through a misunderstanding of a metaphor, a common misconception arose that the phrase &quot;rule of thumb&quot; was related to legally condoned wife beating.

=== English common law ===
A modern folk etymology relates the phrase to domestic violence via an alleged rule under English common law which permitted wife-beating provided that the implement used was a rod or stick no thicker than a man&#x27;s thumb. Wife-beating has been officially outlawed in England and the United States for centuries, but enforcement of the law was inconsistent, and wife-beating did continue. However, a rule of thumb permitting wife-beating was never codified in law.

English jurist William Blackstone wrote in the late 1700s in his &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; that, by an &quot;old law&quot;, a husband had formerly been justified in using &quot;moderate correction&quot; against his wife but was barred from inflicting serious violence; Blackstone did not mention either thumbs or sticks. According to Blackstone, this custom was in doubt by the late 1600s, and a woman was allowed &quot;security of the peace&quot; against an abusive husband. Twentieth-century legal scholar William L. Prosser wrote that there was &quot;probably no truth to the legend&quot; that a husband was allowed to beat his wife &quot;with a stick no thicker than his thumb&quot;.

The association between the thumb and implements of domestic violence can be traced to 1782, when English judge Sir Francis Buller was ridiculed for purportedly stating that a husband could beat his wife, provided that he used a stick no wider than his thumb. There is no record of Buller making such a statement, but the rumor generated much satirical press, with Buller being mocked as &quot;Judge Thumb&quot; in published jokes and cartoons.

In the following century, several court rulings in the United States referred to a supposed common-law doctrine which the judges believed had once allowed wife-beating with an implement smaller than a thumb. None of these courts referred to such a doctrine as a rule of thumb or endorsed such a rule, but all permitted some degree of wife-beating so long as it did not result in serious injury.

=== 19th-century United States ===
An 1824 court ruling in Mississippi stated that a man was entitled to enforce &quot;domestic discipline&quot; by striking his wife with a whip or stick no wider than the judge&#x27;s thumb. In a later case in North Carolina (&quot;State v. Rhodes&quot;, 1868), the defendant was found to have struck his wife &quot;with a switch about the size of this fingers&quot;; the judge found the man not guilty due to the switch being smaller than a thumb. The judgment was upheld by the state supreme court, although the later judge stated:

In 1873, also in North Carolina, the judge in &quot;State v. Oliver&quot; ruled, &quot;We assume that the old doctrine that a husband had the right to whip his wife, provided that he used a switch no larger than his thumb, is not the law in North Carolina&quot;. These latter two cases were cited by the legal scholar Beirne Stedman when he wrote in a 1917 law review article that an &quot;old common law rule&quot; had permitted a husband to use &quot;moderate personal chastisement on his wife&quot; so long as he used &quot;a switch no larger than his thumb&quot;.

By the late 19th century, most American states had outlawed wife-beating; some had severe penalties such as forty lashes or imprisonment for offenders. Although it was commonly believed in parts of the United States that a man was legally permitted to beat his wife with a stick no wider than his thumb, that belief did not have any connection with the phrase &quot;rule of thumb&quot; until a misunderstanding arose in the 1970s.

=== 20th-century feminist revival ===
In the 20th century, public concern with the problem of domestic violence declined at first, and then re-emerged along with the resurgent feminist movement in the 1970s. The first recorded link between wife-beating and the phrase &quot;rule of thumb&quot; appeared in 1976, in a report on domestic violence by women&#x27;s-rights advocate Del Martin: 

While Martin appears to have meant the phrase &quot;rule of thumb&quot; only as a figure of speech, some feminist writers treated it as a literal reference to an earlier law. The following year, a book on battered women stated: 

Despite this erroneous reading of the common law (which is a set of judicial principles rather than a written law with individual sections) the spurious legal doctrine of the &quot;rule of thumb&quot; was soon mentioned in a number of law journals. The myth was repeated in a 1982 report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights on domestic abuse titled &quot;Under the Rule of Thumb&quot;, as well as a later United States Senate report on the Violence Against Women Act.

In the late 20th century, some efforts were made to discourage the phrase &quot;rule of thumb&quot;, which was seen as taboo owing to this false origin. Patricia T. O&#x27;Conner, former editor of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, described it as &quot;one of the most persistent myths of political correctness&quot;. During the 1990s, several authors wrote about the false etymology of &quot;rule of thumb&quot;, including English professor Henry Ansgar Kelly and conservative social critic Christina Hoff Sommers, who described its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone&#x27;s commentary. Nonetheless, the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early 2000s.

<doc id="56542" wikidata="Q736464" url="?curid=56542" title="Hanna-Barbera">
<text>Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc. ( ; formerly known as H-B Enterprises, Hanna-Barbera Productions, Inc. and H-B Production Co.) was an American production company, which was active from 1957 until its absorption into Warner Bros. Animation in 2001. Founded on July 7, 1957 by &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; creators and former MGM Cartoons employees William Hanna and Joseph Barbera along with George Sidney, it was headquartered in Los Angeles at the Kling Studios from 1957 to 1960, then on Cahuenga Boulevard from 1960 to 1998, and subsequently at the Sherman Oaks Galleria in Sherman Oaks from 1998 to 2001.

Notable among the productions that the company produced include &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;, the incarnations and spinoffs of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (until 2001), the opening credits of &quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;The Smurfs&quot;. With these productions, Hanna-Barbera rivaled Disney as the most successful animation studio in the world, with its characters becoming ubiquitous across different types of media and myriad consumer products. 

By the 1980s, however, the company&#x27;s fortunes were in decline, as the profitability of Saturday-morning cartoons was eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication. Taft Broadcasting acquired Hanna-Barbera in 1966 and retained ownership until 1991. It was in this year when Turner Broadcasting System acquired the company, using the back catalog to establish Cartoon Network the following year. 

By the time Hanna died in 2001, Hanna-Barbera as a standalone company was folded into Warner Bros. Animation in the same year. The name continues to be used for copyright, marketing and branding purposes for former properties now produced by Warner Bros.

==History==
===&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and birth of a company (1938–1957)===
William Denby &quot;Bill&quot; Hanna and Joseph Roland &quot;Joe&quot; Barbera met at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio in 1938, while working at its animation unit. Having worked at other studios since the early 1930s, they solidified a six decade working partnership, leading to their very first collaborative success, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, centering on the madcap comical adventures of a cat and a mouse.

Hanna supervised the animation, while Barbera did the stories and pre-production. Seven of the 114 cartoons won seven Oscars for &quot;Best Short Subject (Cartoons)&quot; between 1943 and 1953, and five additional shorts were nominated for twelve awards during this period. However, they were awarded to producer Fred Quimby, who was not involved in the development of the shorts.

Sequences for &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, &quot;Dangerous When Wet&quot; and &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot; and shorts &quot;Swing Social&quot;, &quot;Gallopin&#x27; Gals&quot;, &quot;The Goose Goes South&quot;, &quot;Officer Pooch&quot;, &quot;War Dogs&quot; and &quot;Good Will to Men&quot; were also made. With Quimby&#x27;s retirement in May 1955, Hanna and Barbera became the producers in charge of the MGM animation studio&#x27;s output.

In addition to continuing to write and direct new &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot; shorts, now in CinemaScope, Hanna and Barbera supervised the last seven shorts of Tex Avery&#x27;s &quot;Droopy&quot; series and produced and directed the short-lived &quot;Spike and Tyke&quot;, which ran for two entries. In addition to their work on the cartoons, the two men moonlighted on outside projects, including title sequences and commercials for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

MGM decided in mid-1957 to close its cartoon studio, as it felt it had acquired a reasonable backlog of shorts for re-release. While contemplating their future, Hanna and Barbera began producing additional animated television commercials. During their last year at MGM, they had developed a concept for a new animated television program about a cat and a dog.

After failing to convince the studio to back their venture, George Sidney, who had worked with Hanna and Barbera on several of his movies for MGM, offered to serve as their business partner and convinced Screen Gems to make a deal with the producers. A coin toss gave Hanna precedence in naming the new studio. Harry Cohn, president and head of Columbia Pictures, took an 18% ownership in H-B Enterprises, and provided working capital.

Screen Gems became the new distributor and its licensing agent, handling merchandizing of the characters from the animated programs as the cartoon firm officially opened for business in rented offices on the lot of Kling Studios (formerly Charlie Chaplin Studios) on July 7, 1957, one year after the MGM animation studio closed.

Sidney and several Screen Gems alumni became members of the studio&#x27;s board of directors and much of the former MGM animation staff—including animators Carlo Vinci, Kenneth Muse, Lewis Marshall, Michael Lah and Ed Barge and layout artists Ed Benedict and Richard Bickenbach—became the new production staff while Hoyt Curtin was in charge of providing the music.

===Success with animated series (1957–1969)===
&quot;The Ruff and Reddy Show&quot;, the company&#x27;s first television series, premiered on NBC on December 14, 1957, then &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot; debuted one year later, in 1958, airing in most markets, and was also the first cartoon to win an Emmy. Several animation alumni joined – in particular former Warner Bros. Cartoons storymen Michael Maltese and Warren Foster as head writers, Joe Ruby and Ken Spears as film editors and Iwao Takamoto as character designer.

After reincorporating as Hanna-Barbera Productions, Inc., &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot; and the theatrical cartoon short series &quot;Loopy De Loop&quot; followed in 1959. Walt Disney Productions laid off several of its animators after &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959) bombed on the box-office during its initial theatrical run, with many of them moving to Hanna-Barbera shortly afterwards. In August 1960, it moved into a window-less, cinder block building at 3501 Cahuenga Boulevard West. Though too small to house the staff, some of its employees worked at home.

&quot;The Flintstones&quot; premiered on ABC on September 30, 1960, becoming so the first animated series airing in prime time. It is loosely based on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; and is set in a fictionalized Stone Age of cavemen and dinosaurs. Jackie Gleason considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copyright infringement, but decided not to because he did not want to be known as &quot;the man who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air&quot;. For six seasons, it became the longest-running animated show in American prime time at the time (until &quot;The Simpsons&quot; beat it in 1997), a ratings and merchandising success and the top-ranking animated program in syndication history. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, but its reputation eventually improved and it is now considered a classic.

&quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;, &quot;Top Cat&quot;, &quot;The Hanna-Barbera New Cartoon Series&quot; (consisting of &quot;Wally Gator&quot;, &quot;Touché Turtle and Dum Dum&quot;, and &quot;Lippy the Lion and Hardy Har Har&quot;) and &quot;The Jetsons&quot; soon followed in 1961 and 1962. Several animated television commercials were produced as well, often starring their own characters (including the Pebbles cereal commercials for Post) and the opening credits for &quot;Bewitched&quot;, in which animated caricatures of Samantha and Darrin appeared. These characterizations were reused in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;&#x27; sixth season episode &quot;Samantha&quot;.

In 1963, Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s operations moved to 3400 Cahuenga Boulevard West in Hollywood Hills/Studio City. This contemporary office building was designed by architect Arthur Froehlich. Its ultra-modern design included a sculpted latticework exterior, moat, fountains, and a &quot;Jetsons&quot;-like tower. &quot;The Magilla Gorilla Show&quot;, &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;The Peter Potamus Show&quot;, &quot;Atom Ant&quot;, and &quot;Secret Squirrel&quot; followed in 1964 and 1965.

The partnership with Screen Gems would last until 1965 when Hanna and Barbera announced the sale of their studio to Taft Broadcasting. Taft&#x27;s acquisition of Hanna-Barbera was delayed for a year by a lawsuit from Cohn&#x27;s family, wife Joan Perry and sons John and Harrison Cohn, who felt the studio undervalued the Cohns&#x27; 18% share in when it was sold a few years previously.

In 1966, &quot;Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles&quot; and &quot;Space Ghost&quot; debuted, and by December of that year the litigation had been settled, Taft finally acquired Hanna-Barbera for $12 million and folded the studio into its corporate structure in 1967 and 1968, becoming its distributor. Hanna and Barbera stayed on while Screen Gems retained licensing and distribution rights to their previous produced cartoons and trademarks to the characters into the 1970s and 1980s.

&quot;Shazzan&quot;, &quot;The Banana Splits&quot;, &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, and its spin-offs (&quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot; and &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;) and &quot;Cattanooga Cats&quot; followed from 1967 to 1969. The studio&#x27;s record and music label, Hanna-Barbera Records, was headed by Danny Hutton and distributed by Columbia. Children&#x27;s records featuring its characters were released by Colpix. Hanna-Barbera teamed up with the National Catholic Office for Radio and Television to produce 26 half-hour animated films in 1970, which never materialized.

===Mysteries, spin-offs, and more (1969–1979)===
&quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; debuted on CBS on September 13, 1969; it is a mystery-based program which blended comedy, action, and elements from &quot;I Love a Mystery&quot; and &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;. For two seasons, it centered on four teenagers and a dog solving supernatural mysteries, and became one of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s most successful creations, spawning several new spin-offs, such as &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo&quot; and many others, which were regularly in production at Hanna-Barbera into the 1990s.

Referred to as &quot;The General Motors of animation&quot;, Hanna-Barbera produced nearly two-thirds of all Saturday-morning cartoons in a single year. &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, &quot;The Funky Phantom&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan&quot;, &quot;Speed Buggy&quot;, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids&quot;, &quot;Goober and the Ghost Chasers&quot;, &quot;Inch High, Private Eye&quot;, &quot;Clue Club&quot;, &quot;Jabberjaw&quot;, &quot;Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels&quot; and &quot;The New Shmoo&quot; built upon the mystery-solving template set by &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, with further shows built around teenagers solving mysteries with a comic relief pet of some sort.

Starting in 1971, many new spin-offs, such as &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot;, featuring Fred and Barney&#x27;s now teenaged children along with &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot;, &quot;The New Fred and Barney Show&quot; and &quot;all-star&quot; shows &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Gang&quot;, &quot;Laff-A-Lympics&quot;, &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Space Race&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Goof-Ups&quot; came to the airwaves.

Hanna-Barbera teamed up with Avco Broadcasting Corporation in 1971, a company that was once a rival to its owner Taft at that time, who maintains rivalry in the Columbus and Cincinnati markets, to produce two holiday specials for the syndicated market by way of its syndicated division. In 1972, H-B opened an animation studio in Australia, with the Hamlyn Group acquiring a 50% stake in 1974.

Hamlyn was acquired by James Hardie Industries. Hanna-Barbera Australia bought itself out from Hardie and Taft in 1988, changing its name to Southern Star Group, since becoming Endemol Shine Australia, a division of Banijay. &quot;Super Friends&quot;, an action-adventure show adapted from DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Justice League of America&quot; and the first of many iterations of the &quot;Super Friends&quot; series, premiered on ABC on September 8, 1973. It returned to production in 1976, remaining on ABC through 1985 with &quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot;, &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; and &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Super Friends&quot;.

While &quot;Help!... It&#x27;s the Hair Bear Bunch!&quot;, &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;, &quot;Wait Till Your Father Gets Home&quot; and &quot;Hong Kong Phooey&quot; aired, &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name, was released on March 1, 1973 by Paramount Pictures, to moderate critical and commercial success, and was the first of only four Hanna-Barbera films not to be based upon one of their famous television cartoons (the other three being &quot;C.H.O.M.P.S.&quot;, &quot;Heidi&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Forest&quot;). 

With the majority of American television animation during the second half of the 20th century made by Hanna-Barbera and more cartoons like &quot;CB Bears&quot;, &quot;Buford and the Galloping Ghost&quot;, &quot;The All New Popeye Hour&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot;, major competition was coming from Filmation and DePatie–Freleng. Then-ABC president Fred Silverman gave its Saturday-morning time to them after dropping Filmation for its failure of &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot;.

New live-action material was produced, as well as new live-action/animated combos since the mid-1960s. In 1975, former MGM executive Herbert F. Solow joined the company to start a live-action unit, Hanna-Barbera Television, to produce prime time programming, which later spun off and became Solow Production Company in 1976.

Along with the animation industry in the U.S., it moved away from producing in-house in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While &quot;The Great Grape Ape Show&quot; and &quot;The Mumbly Cartoon Show&quot; aired, Ruby and Spears worked with Hanna-Barbera in 1976 and 1977 as ABC network executives to create and develop new cartoons before leaving in 1977 to start their company, Ruby-Spears Enterprises, with Filmways as its parent division. In 1979, Taft bought Worldvision Enterprises, which became Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s new distributor.

===Control decrease and &quot;Smurfs&quot;-era (1980–1991)===
&quot;Super Friends&quot;, &quot;The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang&quot;, &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Show&quot;, &quot;Space Stars&quot;, &quot;The Kwicky Koala Show&quot;, &quot;Trollkins&quot; and &quot;Laverne and Shirley in the Army&quot; debuted in 1980 and 1981, while Taft purchased Ruby-Spears from Filmways (which was eventually absorbed into Orion Pictures the following year), making it a sister company to Hanna-Barbera and as a result, several early-1980s series were shared between both companies.

While Filmation, Sunbow Productions, Marvel Productions, Rankin/Bass, DIC, Saban Entertainment and other Hollywood animation studios introduced successful animated series syndicated, including some based on licensed properties, Hanna-Barbera fell behind, as it no longer dominated the TV animation market as it did years earlier and lost control over children&#x27;s programming, going down from 80% to 20%.

&quot;The Smurfs&quot;, adapted from the Belgian comic by Peyo and centering on a group of tiny blue creatures led by Papa Smurf, debuted on NBC on September 12, 1981, and ran for nine seasons until December 2, 1989, becoming so the longest-running Saturday-morning cartoon series in broadcast history, a significant ratings success, the top-rated program in eight years and the highest for an NBC show since 1970. &quot;The Gary Coleman Show&quot;, &quot;Shirt Tales&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;, &quot;The Dukes&quot;, &quot;Monchhichis&quot;, &quot;The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show&quot; and &quot;The Biskitts&quot; followed in 1982 and 1983.

Following a 1982 strike, more cartoons were outsourced to Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest Studios, Mr. Big Cartoons, Toei Animation and Fil-Cartoons in Australia and Asia, which provided production services to the studio from 1982 to the end of its existence. &quot;Challenge of the GoBots&quot;, &quot;Pink Panther and Sons&quot;, &quot;Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show&quot;, &quot;Snorks&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible&quot;, &quot;Galtar and the Golden Lance&quot;, &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot;, &quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot;, &quot;The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo&quot; and &quot;Paw Paws&quot; debuted in 1984 and 1985.

&quot;Pound Puppies&quot;, &quot;The Flintstone Kids&quot;, &quot;Foofur&quot;, &quot;Wildfire&quot;, new episodes of &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;Sky Commanders&quot; and &quot;Popeye and Son&quot; arrived in 1986 and 1987. After its financial troubles affected Hanna-Barbera, the American Financial Corporation acquired Taft in 1987 and renamed it Great American Broadcasting. &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Max&quot;, &quot;The Further Adventures of SuperTed&quot; and &quot;Paddington Bear&quot; followed in 1988 and 1989.

Hanna-Barbera Poland, a Polish branch of the company, opened up and dealt with the promotion and distribution of animated H-B content and is most well known for releasing VHS tapes with Polish music distributor P.P. Polskie Nagrania, which mostly consisted of numbered compilation releases of Hanna-Barbera shows on one tape. This would last until 1993, when the company separated and reincorporated itself as Curtis Art Productions.

Great American sold Worldvision to Aaron Spelling Productions, while Hanna-Barbera and its library remained with them. Hanna-Barbera split off from Worldvision Home Video in early 1989 to start out its own home video division, Hanna-Barbera Home Video. In January 1989, while working on &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;, Tom Ruegger got a call from Warner Bros. to resurrect its animation department.

Ruegger, along with several of his colleagues, left Hanna-Barbera at that time to develop &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; at Warner Bros. David Kirschner, known for &quot;An American Tail&quot; and &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, was later appointed as the studio&#x27;s new CEO. Later that year, the company had a licensing agreement with MicroIllusions, a video game publisher, to produce video games based on its properties, namely &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot; and others.

In 1990, while Kirschner and the company formed Bedrock Productions and Great American putting Hanna-Barbera and Ruby-Spears up for sale, &quot;Midnight Patrol: Adventures in the Dream Zone&quot;, &quot;Rick Moranis in Gravedale High&quot;, &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot;, &quot;Bill and Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventures&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Don Coyote and Sancho Panda&quot; and &quot;Wake, Rattle, and Roll&quot; debuted that year. &quot;The Pirates of Dark Water&quot;, &quot;Yo Yogi!&quot; and &quot;Young Robin Hood&quot; would follow in 1991.

===Acquisition by Turner Broadcasting System and absorption into Warner Bros. Animation (1991–2001)===
Turner Broadcasting System outbid MCA (then-parent company of Universal Pictures), Hallmark Cards and other major companies in acquiring Hanna-Barbera while also purchasing Ruby-Spears as well. The two companies were acquired in a 50-50 joint venture between Turner Broadcasting System and Apollo Investment Fund for $320 million. Turner purchased these assets to launch a then-new all-animation network aimed at children and younger audiences.

Scott Sassa hired Fred Seibert to head Hanna-Barbera, who filled the gap left by Great American&#x27;s crew with new animators, directors, producers and writers, including Craig McCracken, Donovan Cook, Genndy Tartakovsky, David Feiss, Seth MacFarlane, Van Partible and Butch Hartman. After being newly named as H-B Production Co., &quot;Capitol Critters&quot; and &quot;Fish Police&quot; followed in 1992. Cartoon Network launched on October 1 of that year, and became the first 24-hour all-animation channel, to air its library of cartoon classics, of which Hanna-Barbera was the core contributor.

In 1993, the company again renamed itself to Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc. (though the Hanna-Barbera Productions name was still used in regards to the pre-1992 properties) and, while Turner acquired its remaining interests from Apollo Investment Fund for $255 million, &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;, &quot;Droopy, Master Detective&quot;, &quot;The New Adventures of Captain Planet&quot; and &quot;SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron&quot; debuted that year. Turner refocused the studio to produce new shows exclusively for its networks.

In 1995, while Bruce Johnson would leave the company, &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; debuted, while Seibert launched &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; for Cartoon Network. During 1996, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; and &quot;Cave Kids&quot; debuted, while Turner merged with Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery). While &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; and &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; aired, the Hanna-Barbera studio faced demolition after many of its staff vacated the facilities in 1997, despite the efforts of preserving it.
In 1998, following &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, Hanna-Barbera moved from Cahuenga Blvd. to Sherman Oaks Galleria in Sherman Oaks, California in 1998, where Warner Bros. Animation was located. &quot;I Am Weasel&quot; would be its final show in 1999. After the company&#x27;s absorption into Warner Bros. Animation, Hanna died of throat cancer on March 22, 2001, at the age of 90 years old.

===Aftermath and Barbera&#x27;s final years (2001–2006)===

While Cartoon Network Studios took over production of programming, the Los Angeles City Council approved a plan to preserve the Cahuenga Blvd. headquarters in May 2004, while allowing retail and residential development on the site.

Barbera died of natural causes on December 18, 2006, at the age of 95 years old. Warner Bros. Animation continues to produce new productions based on the Hanna-Barbera properties since then. Cartoon Network Studios Europe was rebranded as Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe paying tribute to the company in April 2021.

==Production==
===Production process changes===
The small budgets that television animation producers had to work within prevented Hanna-Barbera from working with the full theatrical-quality animation that Hanna and Barbera had been known for at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. While the budget for MGM&#x27;s seven-minute &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts was about $35,000, the Hanna-Barbera studios were required to produce five-minute &quot;Ruff and Reddy&quot; episodes for no more than $3,000 apiece. To keep within these tighter budgets, Hanna-Barbera furthered the concept of limited animation (also called &quot;planned animation&quot;) practiced and popularized by the United Productions of America (UPA) studio, which also once had a partnership with Columbia Pictures. Character designs were simplified, and backgrounds and animation cycles (walks, runs, etc.) were regularly re-purposed.

Characters were often broken up into a handful of levels so that only the parts of the body that needed to be moved at a given time (i.e. a mouth, an arm, a head) were animated. The rest of the figure remained on a held animation cel. This allowed a typical seven-minute short to be done with only nearly 2,000 drawings instead of the usual 14,000. Dialogue, music, and sound effects were emphasized over action, leading Chuck Jones—a contemporary who worked for Warner Bros. Cartoons and whose short &quot;The Dover Boys&quot; practically invented many of the concepts in limited animation — to disparagingly refer to the limited television cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera and others as &quot;illustrated radio&quot;.

In a story published by &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1961, critics stated that Hanna-Barbera was taking on more work than it could handle and was resorting to shortcuts only a television audience would tolerate. An executive who worked for Walt Disney Productions said, &quot;We don&#x27;t even consider [them] competition&quot;. Animation historian Christopher P. Lehman argues that Hanna-Barbera attempted to maximize their bottom line by recycling story formulas and characterization instead of introducing new ones. Once a formula for an original series was deemed successful, the studio reused it in subsequent series. Besides copying their own works, Hanna-Barbera drew inspiration from the works of other people and studios.

Lehman considers that the studio served as the main example of how animation studios that focused on TV animation differed from those that focused on theatrical animation. Theatrical animation studios tried to maintain full and fluid animation and consequently struggled with the rising expenses associated with producing it. Limited animation as practiced by Hanna-Barbera kept production costs at a minimum. The cost in quality of using this technique was that Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s characters only moved when necessary.

Its solution to the criticism over its quality was to go into films. It produced six theatrical feature films, among them are higher-quality versions of its television cartoons and adaptations of other material. It was also one of the first animation studios to have their work produced overseas. One of these companies was a subsidiary began by Hanna-Barbera in November 1987 called Fil-Cartoons in the Philippines, with Jerry Smith as a consultant for the subsidiary. Wang Film Productions got its start as an overseas facility for the studio in 1978.

===Digital innovation===
Hanna-Barbera was among the first animation studios to incorporate digital tools into their pipeline. As early as the 1970s, they experimented with using Scanimate, a video synthesizer, to create an early form of digital cutout style. A clip of artists using the machine to manipulate scanned images of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; characters, scaling and warping the artwork to simulate animation, is available at the Internet Archive.

Likewise, Hanna-Barbera was perhaps the first proponent of digital ink and paint, a process wherein animators&#x27; drawings were scanned into computers and colored using software. Led by Marc Levoy, Hanna-Barbera began developing a computerized digital ink and paint system in 1979 to help bypass much of the time-consuming labor of painting and photographing cels. The process was implemented on a third of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s animated programs, televised feature films and specials from 1982 through 1996.

===Sound effects===
Hanna-Barbera was known for its large library of sound effects, which have been featured in exhibitions at the Norman Rockwell Museum.

==Ownership==
After Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s partnership with Screen Gems ended in 1966, it was sold to Taft Broadcasting, where it remained its owner until 1991 when Turner Broadcasting System acquired the company and its library for its flagship network, Cartoon Network. In 1996, Turner merged with Time Warner, then WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. Discovery.

The company was separated from Cartoon Network Studios and absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation in 2001. Since its closure, Hanna-Barbera became an in-name-only unit of Warner Bros. and it has continued to produce new material and programming based on its classic intellectual property and the classic Hanna-Barbera logo occasionally appears.

In 1998, the rights to Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s productions for Cartoon Network (excluding &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot;) were transferred to the latter entity, Cartoon Network claimed ownership of later Hanna-Barbera co-productions beginning with &quot;Cow &amp; Chicken&quot;&#x27;s third season.

<doc id="56549" wikidata="Q1767180" url="?curid=56549" title="Beta cell">
<text>Beta cells (β-cells) are specialized endocrine cells located within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans responsible for the production and release of insulin and amylin. Constituting ~50–70% of cells in human islets, beta cells play a vital role in maintaining blood glucose levels. Problems with beta cells can lead to disorders such as diabetes.

== Function ==
The function of beta cells is primarily centered around the synthesis and secretion of hormones, particularly insulin and amylin. Both hormones work to keep blood glucose levels within a narrow, healthy range by different mechanisms. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose by cells, allowing them to use it for energy or store it for future use. Amylin helps regulate the rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream after a meal, slowing down the absorption of nutrients by inhibit gastric emptying.

== Insulin synthesis ==
Beta cells are the only site of insulin synthesis in mammals. As glucose stimulates insulin secretion, it simultaneously increases proinsulin biosynthesis through translational control and enhanced gene transcription.

The insulin gene is first transcribed into mRNA and translated into preproinsulin. After translation, the preproinsulin precursor contains an N-terminal signal peptide that allows translocation into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Inside the RER, the signal peptide is cleaved to form proinsulin. Then, folding of proinsulin occurs forming three disulfide bonds. Subsequent to protein folding, proinsulin is transported to the Golgi apparatus and enters immature insulin granules where proinsulin is cleaved to form insulin and C-peptide. After maturation, these secretory vesicles hold insulin, C-peptide, and amylin until calcium triggers exocytosis of the granule contents.

Through translational processing, insulin is encoded as a 110 amino acid precursor but is secreted as a 51 amino acid protein.

== Insulin secretion ==

In beta cells, insulin release is stimulated primarily by glucose present in the blood. As circulating glucose levels rise such as after ingesting a meal, insulin is secreted in a dose-dependent fashion. This system of release is commonly referred to as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). There are four key pieces to the triggering pathway of GSIS: GLUT2 dependent glucose uptake, glucose metabolism, K channel closure, and the opening of voltage gated calcium channels causing insulin granule fusion and exocytosis.

Voltage-gated calcium channels and ATP-sensitive potassium ion channels are embedded in the plasma membrane of beta cells. These ATP-sensitive potassium ion channels are normally open and the calcium ion channels are normally closed. Potassium ions diffuse out of the cell, down their concentration gradient, making the inside of the cell more negative with respect to the outside (as potassium ions carry a positive charge). At rest, this creates a potential difference across the cell surface membrane of -70mV.

When the glucose concentration outside the cell is high, glucose molecules move into the cell by facilitated diffusion, down its concentration gradient through the GLUT2 transporter. Since beta cells use glucokinase to catalyze the first step of glycolysis, metabolism only occurs around physiological blood glucose levels and above. Metabolism of the glucose produces ATP, which increases the ATP to ADP ratio.

The ATP-sensitive potassium ion channels close when this ratio rises. This means that potassium ions can no longer diffuse out of the cell. As a result, the potential difference across the membrane becomes more positive (as potassium ions accumulate inside the cell). This change in potential difference opens the voltage-gated calcium channels, which allows calcium ions from outside the cell to diffuse in down their concentration gradient. When the calcium ions enter the cell, they cause vesicles containing insulin to move to, and fuse with, the cell surface membrane, releasing insulin by exocytosis into the hepatic portal vein.

In addition to the triggering pathway, the amplifying pathway can cause increased insulin secretion without a further increase in intracellular calcium levels. The amplifying pathway is modulated by byproducts of glucose metabolism along with various intracellular signaling pathways.

== Other hormones secreted ==
* C-peptide, which is secreted into the bloodstream in equimolar quantities to insulin. C-peptide helps to prevent neuropathy and other vascular deterioration related symptoms of diabetes mellitus. A practitioner would measure the levels of C-peptide to obtain an estimate for the viable beta cell mass.
* Amylin, also known as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). The function of amylin is to slow the rate of glucose entering the bloodstream. Amylin can be described as a synergistic partner to insulin, where insulin regulates long term food intake and amylin regulates short term food intake.

==Clinical significance==
Beta cells have significant clinical relevance as their proper function is essential for glucose regulation, and dysfunction is a key factor in the development and progression of diabetes and its associated complications. Here are some key clinical significances of beta cells:

=== Type 1 diabetes ===
Type 1 diabetes mellitus, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes, is believed to be caused by an auto-immune mediated destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the body. The process of beta-cell destruction begins with insulitis activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs). APCs then trigger activation of CD4+ helper-T cells and chemokines/cytokines release. Then, the cytokines activate CD8+ cytotoxic–T cells which leads to beta-cell destruction. The destruction of these cells reduces the body&#x27;s ability to respond to glucose levels in the body, therefore making it nearly impossible to properly regulate glucose and glucagon levels in the bloodstream. The body destroys 70–80% of beta cells, leaving only 20–30% of functioning cells. This can cause the patient to experience hyperglycemia, which leads to other adverse short-term and long-term conditions. The symptoms of diabetes can potentially be controlled with methods such as regular doses of insulin and sustaining a proper diet. However, these methods can be tedious and cumbersome to continuously perform on a daily basis.

=== Type 2 diabetes ===
Type 2 diabetes, also known as non insulin dependent diabetes and as chronic hyperglycemia, is caused primarily by genetics and the development of metabolic syndrome. The beta cells can still secrete insulin but the body has developed a resistance and its response to insulin has declined. It is believed to be due to the decline of specific receptors on the surface of the liver, adipose, and muscle cells which lose their ability to respond to insulin that circulates in the blood. In an effort to secrete enough insulin to overcome the increasing insulin resistance, the beta cells increase their function, size and number. Increased insulin secretion leads to hyperinsulinemia, but blood glucose levels remain within their normal range due to the decreased efficacy of insulin signaling. However, the beta cells can become overworked and exhausted from being overstimulated, leading to a 50% reduction in function along with a 40% decrease in beta-cell volume. At this point, not enough insulin can be produced and secreted to keep blood glucose levels within their normal range, causing overt type 2 diabetes.

=== Insulinoma ===
Insulinoma is a rare tumor derived from the neoplasia of beta cells. Insulinomas are usually benign, but may be medically significant and even life-threatening due to recurrent and prolonged attacks of hypoglycemia.

=== Medications ===
Many drugs to combat diabetes are aimed at modifying the function of the beta cell.

* Sulfonylureas are insulin secretagogues that act by closing the ATP-sensitive potassium channels, thereby causing insulin release. These drugs are known to cause hypoglycemia and can lead to beta-cell failure due to overstimulation. Second-generation versions of sulfonylureas are shorter acting and less likely to cause hypoglycemia.
* GLP-1 receptor agonists stimulate insulin secretion by simulating activation of the body&#x27;s endogenous incretin system. The incretin system acts as an insulin secretion amplifying pathway.
* DPP-4 inhibitors block DPP-4 activity which increases postprandial incretin hormone concentration, therefore increasing insulin secretion.

== Research ==
=== Experimental techniques ===
Many researchers around the world are investigating the pathogenesis of diabetes and beta-cell failure. Tools used to study beta-cell function are expanding rapidly with technology.

For instance, transcriptomics have allowed researchers to comprehensively analyze gene transcription in beta-cells to look for genes linked to diabetes. A more common mechanism of analyzing cellular function is calcium imaging. Fluorescent dyes bind to calcium and allow &quot;in vitro&quot; imaging of calcium activity which correlates directly with insulin release. A final tool used in beta-cell research are &quot;in vivo&quot; experiments. Diabetes mellitus can be experimentally induced &quot;in vivo&quot; for research purposes by streptozotocin or alloxan, which are specifically toxic to beta cells. Mouse and rat models of diabetes also exist including ob/ob and db/db mice which are a type 2 diabetes model, and non-obese diabetic mice (NOD) which are a model for type 1 diabetes.

=== Type 1 diabetes ===

Research has shown that beta cells can be differentiated from human pancreas progenitor cells. These differentiated beta cells, however, often lack much of the structure and markers that beta cells need to perform their necessary functions. Examples of the anomalies that arise from beta cells differentiated from progenitor cells include a failure to react to environments with high glucose concentrations, an inability to produce necessary beta cell markers, and abnormal expression of glucagon along with insulin.

In order to successfully re-create functional insulin producing beta cells, studies have shown that manipulating cell-signal pathways in early stem cell development will lead to those stem cells differentiating into viable beta cells. Two key signal pathways have been shown to play a vital role in the differentiation of stem cells into beta cells: the BMP4 pathway and the kinase C. Targeted manipulation of these two pathways has shown that it is possible to induce beta cell differentiation from stem cells. These variations of artificial beta cells have shown greater levels of success in replicating the functionality of natural beta cells, although the replication has not been perfectly re-created yet.

Studies have shown that it is possible to regenerate beta cells &quot;in vivo&quot; in some animal models. Research in mice has shown that beta cells can often regenerate to the original quantity number after the beta cells have undergone some sort of stress test, such as the intentional destruction of the beta cells in the mice subject or once the auto-immune response has concluded. While these studies have conclusive results in mice, beta cells in human subjects may not possess this same level of versatility. Investigation of beta cells following acute onset of Type 1 diabetes has shown little to no proliferation of newly synthesized beta cells, suggesting that human beta cells might not be as versatile as rat beta cells, but there is actually no comparison that can be made here because healthy (non-diabetic) rats were used to prove that beta cells can proliferate after intentional destruction of beta cells, while diseased (type-1 diabetic) humans were used in the study which was attempted to use as evidence against beta cells regenerating.

It appears that much work has to be done in the field of regenerating beta cells. Just as in the discovery of creating insulin through the use of recombinant DNA, the ability to artificially create stem cells that would differentiate into beta cells would prove to be an invaluable resource to patients with Type 1 diabetes. An unlimited amount of beta cells produced artificially could potentially provide therapy to many of the patients who are affected by Type 1 diabetes.

=== Type 2 diabetes ===
Research focused on non insulin dependent diabetes encompasses many areas of interest. Degeneration of the beta cell as diabetes progresses has been a broadly reviewed topic. Another topic of interest for beta-cell physiologists is the mechanism of insulin pulsatility which has been well investigated. Many genome studies have been completed and are advancing the knowledge of beta-cell function exponentially. Indeed, the area of beta-cell research is very active yet many mysteries remain.
