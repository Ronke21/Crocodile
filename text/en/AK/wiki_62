<doc id="55382" wikidata="Q80837" url="?curid=55382" title="Supernatural">
<text>Supernatural refers to phenomena or entities that are beyond the laws of nature. The term is derived from Medieval Latin , from Latin ,(&quot;above, beyond, or outside of&quot;) + ,(&quot;nature&quot;). Although the corollary term &quot;nature&quot; has had multiple meanings since the ancient world, the term &quot;supernatural&quot; emerged in the Middle Ages and did not exist in the ancient world.

The supernatural is featured in folklore and religious contexts, but can also feature as an explanation in more secular contexts, as in the cases of superstitions or belief in the paranormal. The term is attributed to non-physical entities, such as angels, demons, gods and spirits. It also includes claimed abilities embodied in or provided by such beings, including magic, telekinesis, levitation, precognition and extrasensory perception.

The supernatural is hypernymic to religion. Religions are standardized supernaturalist worldviews, or at least more complete than single supernaturalist views. Supernaturalism is the adherence to the supernatural (beliefs, and not violations of causality and the physical laws).

==Etymology and history of the concept==
Occurring as both an adjective and a noun, antecedents of the modern English compound &quot;supernatural&quot; enter the language from two sources: via Middle French () and directly from the Middle French&#x27;s term&#x27;s ancestor, post-Classical Latin (). Post-classical Latin first occurs in the 6th century, composed of the Latin prefix and (see nature). The earliest known appearance of the word in the English language occurs in a Middle English translation of Catherine of Siena&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue&quot; (&quot;orcherd of Syon&quot;, around 1425; ).

The semantic value of the term has shifted over the history of its use. Originally the term referred exclusively to Christian understandings of the world. For example, as an adjective, the term can mean &quot;belonging to a realm or system that transcends nature, as that of divine, magical, or ghostly beings; attributed to or thought to reveal some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature; occult, paranormal&quot; or &quot;more than what is natural or ordinary; unnaturally or extraordinarily great; abnormal, extraordinary&quot;. Obsolete uses include &quot;of, relating to, or dealing with metaphysics&quot;. As a noun, the term can mean &quot;a supernatural being&quot;, with a particularly strong history of employment in relation to entities from the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.

===History of the concept===
The ancient world had no word that resembled &quot;supernatural&quot;. Dialogues from Neoplatonic philosophy in the third century AD influenced the development of the concept of the supernatural, which later evolved through Christian theology. The term &quot;nature&quot; had existed since antiquity, with Latin authors like Augustine using the word and its cognates at least 600 times in &quot;City of God&quot;. In the medieval period, &quot;nature&quot; had ten different meanings and &quot;natural&quot; had eleven different meanings. Peter Lombard, a medieval scholastic of the 12th century, explored causes beyond nature, questioning how certain phenomena could be attributed solely to God. In his writings, he used the term &quot;praeter naturam&quot; to describe these occurrences. In the scholastic period, Thomas Aquinas classified miracles into three categories: &quot;above nature&quot;, &quot;beyond nature&quot; and &quot;against nature&quot;. In doing so, he sharpened the distinction between nature and miracles more than the early Church Fathers had done. As a result, he had created a dichotomy of sorts of the natural and supernatural. Though the phrase &quot;supra naturam&quot; was used since the 4th century AD, it was in the 1200s that Thomas Aquinas used the term &quot;&quot;supernaturalis&quot;.&quot; Despite this, the term had to wait until the end of the medieval period before it became more popularly used. The discussions on &quot;nature&quot; from the scholastic period were diverse and unsettled with some postulating that even miracles are natural and that natural magic was a natural part of the world.

==Epistemology and metaphysics==

The metaphysical considerations of the existence of the supernatural can be difficult to approach as an exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis, the natural, will ultimately have to be inverted or rejected. One complicating factor is that there is disagreement about the definition of &quot;natural&quot; and the limits of naturalism. Concepts in the supernatural domain are closely related to concepts in religious spirituality and occultism or spiritualism.

Nomological possibility is possibility under the actual laws of nature. Most philosophers since David Hume have held that the laws of nature are metaphysically contingent—that there could have been different natural laws than the ones that actually obtain. If so, then it would not be logically or metaphysically impossible, for example, for you to travel to Alpha Centauri in one day; it would just have to be the case that you could travel faster than the speed of light. But of course there is an important sense in which this is not nomologically possible; given that the laws of nature are what they are. In the philosophy of natural science, impossibility assertions come to be widely accepted as overwhelmingly probable rather than considered proved to the point of being unchallengeable. The basis for this strong acceptance is a combination of extensive evidence of something not occurring, combined with an underlying scientific theory, very successful in making predictions, whose assumptions lead logically to the conclusion that something is impossible. While an impossibility assertion in natural science can never be absolutely proved, it could be refuted by the observation of a single counterexample. Such a counterexample would require that the assumptions underlying the theory that implied the impossibility be re-examined. Some philosophers, such as Sydney Shoemaker, have argued that the laws of nature are in fact necessary, not contingent; if so, then nomological possibility is equivalent to metaphysical possibility.

The term &quot;supernatural&quot; is often used interchangeably with paranormal or preternatural—the latter typically limited to an adjective for describing abilities which appear to exceed what is possible within the boundaries of the laws of physics. Epistemologically, the relationship between the supernatural and the natural is indistinct in terms of natural phenomena that, &quot;ex hypothesi,&quot; violate the laws of nature, in so far as such laws are realistically accountable.
Views on the &quot;supernatural&quot; vary, for example it may be seen as:
* indistinct from nature. From this perspective, some events occur according to the laws of nature, and others occur according to a separate set of principles external to known nature. For example, in Scholasticism, it was believed that God was capable of performing any miracle so long as it did not lead to a logical contradiction. Some religions posit immanent deities, however, and do not have a tradition analogous to the supernatural; some believe that everything anyone experiences occurs by the will (occasionalism), in the mind (neoplatonism), or as a part (nondualism) of a more fundamental divine reality (platonism).
* incorrect human attribution. In this view all events have natural and only natural causes. They believe that human beings ascribe supernatural attributes to purely natural events, such as lightning, rainbows, floods and the origin of life.

==Cross cultural studies==
Anthropological studies across cultures indicate that people do not hold or use natural and supernatural explanations in a mutually exclusive or dichotomous fashion. Instead, the reconciliation of natural and supernatural explanations is normal and pervasive across cultures. Cross cultural studies indicate that there is coexistence of natural and supernatural explanations in both adults and children for explaining numerous things about the world, such as illness, death, and origins. Context and cultural input play a large role in determining when and how individuals incorporate natural and supernatural explanations. The coexistence of natural and supernatural explanations in individuals may be the outcomes two distinct cognitive domains: one concerned with the physical-mechanical relations and another with social relations. Studies on indigenous groups have allowed for insights on how such coexistence of explanations may function.

==Supernatural concepts==
===Deity===

A &quot;deity&quot; ( or ) is a supernatural being considered divine or sacred. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; defines deity as &quot;a god or goddess (in a polytheistic religion)&quot;, or anything revered as divine. C. Scott Littleton defines a deity as &quot;a being with powers greater than those of ordinary humans, but who interacts with humans, positively or negatively, in ways that carry humans to new levels of consciousness, beyond the grounded preoccupations of ordinary life.&quot; A male deity is a god, while a female deity is a goddess.

Religions can be categorized by how many deities they worship. Monotheistic religions accept only one deity (predominantly referred to as God), polytheistic religions accept multiple deities. Henotheistic religions accept one supreme deity without denying other deities, considering them as equivalent aspects of the same divine principle; and nontheistic religions deny any supreme eternal creator deity but accept a pantheon of deities which live, die and are reborn just like any other being.

Various cultures have conceptualized a deity differently than a monotheistic God. A deity need not be omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent or eternal, The monotheistic God, however, does have these attributes. Monotheistic religions typically refer to God in masculine terms, while other religions refer to their deities in a variety of ways – masculine, feminine, androgynous and gender neutral.

Historically, many ancient cultures – such as Ancient India, Ancient Iraq, Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Greek, Ancient Roman, Nordic and Asian culture – personified natural phenomena, variously as either their conscious causes or simply their effects, respectively. Some Avestan and Vedic deities were viewed as ethical concepts. In Indian religions, deities have been envisioned as manifesting within the temple of every living being&#x27;s body, as sensory organs and mind. Deities have also been envisioned as a form of existence (Saṃsāra) after rebirth, for human beings who gain merit through an ethical life, where they become guardian deities and live blissfully in heaven, but are also subject to death when their merit runs out.

===Angel===

An angel is generally a supernatural being found in various religions and mythologies. In Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, angels are often depicted as benevolent celestial beings who act as intermediaries between God or Heaven and Earth. Other roles of angels include protecting and guiding human beings and carrying out God&#x27;s tasks. Within Abrahamic religions, angels are often organized into hierarchies, although such rankings may vary between sects in each religion, and are given specific names or titles, such as Gabriel or &quot;Destroying angel&quot;. The term &quot;angel&quot; has also been expanded to various notions of spirits or figures found in other religious traditions. The theological study of angels is known as &quot;angelology&quot;.

In fine art, angels are usually depicted as having the shape of human beings of extraordinary beauty; they are often identified using the symbols of bird wings, halos and light.

===Prophecy===

Prophecy involves a process in which messages are communicated by a god to a prophet. Such messages typically involve inspiration, interpretation, or revelation of divine will concerning the prophet&#x27;s social world and events to come (compare divine knowledge). Prophecy is not limited to any one culture. It is a common property to all known ancient societies around the world, some more than others. Many systems and rules about prophecy have been proposed over several millennia.

===Revelation===

In religion and theology, revelation is the revealing or disclosing of some form of truth or knowledge through communication with a deity or other supernatural entity or entities.

Some religions have religious texts which they view as divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired. For instance, Orthodox Jews, Christians and Muslims believe that the &quot;Torah&quot; was received from Yahweh on biblical Mount Sinai. Most Christians believe that both the Old Testament and the New Testament were inspired by God. Muslims believe the Quran was revealed by God to Muhammad word by word through the angel Gabriel (&quot;Jibril&quot;). In Hinduism, some Vedas are considered &quot;&quot;, &quot;not human compositions&quot;, and are supposed to have been directly revealed, and thus are called &quot;śruti&quot;, &quot;what is heard&quot;. Aleister Crowley stated that &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; had been revealed to him through a higher being that called itself &quot;Aiwass&quot;.

A revelation communicated by a supernatural entity reported as being present during the event is called a vision. Direct conversations between the recipient and the supernatural entity, or physical marks such as stigmata, have been reported. In rare cases, such as that of Saint Juan Diego, physical artifacts accompany the revelation. The Roman Catholic concept of interior locution includes just an inner voice heard by the recipient.

In the Abrahamic religions, the term is used to refer to the process by which God reveals knowledge of himself, his will and his divine providence to the world of human beings. In secondary usage, revelation refers to the resulting human knowledge about God, prophecy and other divine things. Revelation from a supernatural source plays a less important role in some other religious traditions such as Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism.

===Reincarnation===
Reincarnation is the philosophical or religious concept that an aspect of a living being starts a new life in a different physical body or form after each biological death. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the Saṃsāra doctrine of cyclic existence. It is a central tenet of all major Indian religions, namely Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. The idea of reincarnation is found in many ancient cultures, and a belief in rebirth/metempsychosis was held by Greek historic figures, such as Pythagoras, Socrates and Plato. It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as Spiritism, Theosophy and Eckankar and as an esoteric belief in many streams of Orthodox Judaism. It is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Australia, East Asia, Siberia and South America.

Although the majority of denominations within Christianity and Islam do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of Cathars, Alawites, the Druze and the Rosicrucians. The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of Neoplatonism, Orphism, Hermeticism, Manicheanism and Gnosticism of the Roman era as well as the Indian religions, have been the subject of recent scholarly research. Unity Church and its founder Charles Fillmore teaches reincarnation.

In recent decades, many Europeans and North Americans have developed an interest in reincarnation, and many contemporary works mention it.

===Karma===

Karma (; , ; ) means action, work or deed; it also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect). Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering.

With origins in ancient India&#x27;s Vedic civilization, the philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth in many schools of Indian religions (particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism) as well as Taoism. In these schools, karma in the present affects one&#x27;s future in the current life, as well as the nature and quality of future lives – one&#x27;s &quot;saṃsāra&quot;.

===Christian theology===

In Catholic theology, the supernatural order is, according to New Advent, defined as &quot;the ensemble of effects exceeding the powers of the created universe and gratuitously produced by God for the purpose of raising the rational creature above its native sphere to a God-like life and destiny.&quot; The &quot;Modern Catholic Dictionary&quot; defines it as &quot;the sum total of heavenly destiny and all the divinely established means of reaching that destiny, which surpass the mere powers and capacities of human nature.&quot;

===Process theology===

Process theology is a school of thought influenced by the metaphysical process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947) and further developed by Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000).
=== Heaven ===

&quot;Heaven&quot;, or &quot;the heavens&quot;, is a common religious, cosmological, or transcendent place where beings such as gods, angels, spirits, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to Earth or incarnate, and earthly beings can ascend to heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases enter heaven alive.

Heaven is often described as a &quot;higher place&quot;, the holiest place, a Paradise, in contrast to hell or the Underworld or the &quot;low places&quot; and universally or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of divinity, goodness, piety, faith, or other virtues or right beliefs or simply the will of God. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a &quot;world to come&quot;.

Another belief is in an axis mundi or world tree which connects the heavens, the terrestrial world and the underworld. In Indian religions, heaven is considered as &quot;Svarga loka&quot;, and the soul is again subjected to rebirth in different living forms according to its &quot;karma&quot;. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves &quot;Moksha&quot; or &quot;Nirvana&quot;. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (Heaven, Hell, or other) is referred to as &quot;otherworld.&quot;

=== Underworld ===

The &quot;underworld&quot; is the supernatural world of the dead in various religious traditions, located below the world of the living. Chthonic is the technical adjective for things of the underworld.

The concept of an underworld is found in almost every civilization and &quot;may be as old as humanity itself&quot;. Common features of underworld myths are accounts of living people making journeys to the underworld, often for some heroic purpose. Other myths reinforce traditions that entrance of souls to the underworld requires a proper observation of ceremony, such as the ancient Greek story of the recently dead Patroclus haunting Achilles until his body could be properly buried for this purpose. Persons having social status were dressed and equipped in order to better navigate the underworld.

A number of mythologies incorporate the concept of the soul of the deceased making its own journey to the underworld, with the dead needing to be taken across a defining obstacle such as a lake or a river to reach this destination. Imagery of such journeys can be found in both ancient and modern art. The descent to the underworld has been described as &quot;the single most important myth for Modernist authors&quot;.

===Spirit===
A &quot;spirit&quot; is a supernatural being, often but not exclusively a non-physical entity; such as a ghost, fairy, jinn or angel. The concepts of a person&#x27;s spirit and soul, often also overlap, as both are either contrasted with or given ontological priority over the body and both are believed to survive bodily death in some religions, and &quot;spirit&quot; can also have the sense of &quot;ghost&quot;, i.e. a manifestation of the spirit of a deceased person. In English Bibles, &quot;the Spirit&quot; (with a capital &quot;S&quot;), specifically denotes the Holy Spirit.

Spirit is often used metaphysically to refer to the consciousness or personality.

Historically, it was also used to refer to a &quot;subtle&quot; as opposed to &quot;gross&quot; material substance, as in the famous last paragraph of Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;.

===Demon===
A &quot;demon&quot; (from Koine Greek &quot;daimónion&quot;) is a supernatural and often malevolent being prevalent in religion, occultism, literature, fiction, mythology and folklore.

In Ancient Near Eastern religions as well as in the Abrahamic traditions, including ancient and medieval Christian demonology, a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity, below the heavenly planes which may cause demonic possession, calling for an exorcism. In Western occultism and Renaissance magic, which grew out of an amalgamation of Greco-Roman magic, Jewish Aggadah and Christian demonology, a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled.

===Magic===

&quot;Magic&quot; or &quot;sorcery&quot; is the use of rituals, symbols, actions, gestures, or language with the aim of utilizing supernatural forces. Belief in and practice of magic has been present since the earliest human cultures and continues to have an important spiritual, religious and medicinal role in many cultures today. The term &quot;magic&quot; has a variety of meanings, and there is no widely agreed upon definition of what it is.

Scholars of religion have defined magic in different ways. One approach, associated with the anthropologists Edward Tylor and James G. Frazer, suggests that magic and science are opposites. An alternative approach, associated with the sociologists Marcel Mauss and Emile Durkheim, argues that magic takes place in private, while religion is a communal and organised activity. Many scholars of religion have rejected the utility of the term &quot;magic&quot; and it has become increasingly unpopular within scholarship since the 1990s.

The term &quot;magic&quot; comes from the Old Persian &quot;magu&quot;, a word that applied to a form of religious functionary about which little is known. During the late sixth and early fifth centuries BC, this term was adopted into Ancient Greek, where it was used with negative connotations, to apply to religious rites that were regarded as fraudulent, unconventional and dangerous. This meaning of the term was then adopted by Latin in the first century BC. The concept was then incorporated into Christian theology during the first century AD, where magic was associated with demons and thus defined against religion. This concept was pervasive throughout the Middle Ages, although in the early modern period Italian humanists reinterpreted the term in a positive sense to establish the idea of natural magic. Both negative and positive understandings of the term were retained in Western culture over the following centuries, with the former largely influencing early academic usages of the word.

Throughout history, there have been examples of individuals who practiced magic and referred to themselves as magicians. This trend has proliferated in the modern period, with a growing number of magicians appearing within the esoteric milieu. British esotericist Aleister Crowley described magic as the art of effecting change in accordance with will.

===Divination===

Divination (from Latin &quot;divinare&quot; &quot;to foresee, to be inspired by a god&quot;, related to &quot;divinus&quot;, divine) is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic, standardized process or ritual. Used in various forms throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a querent should proceed by reading signs, events, or omens, or through alleged contact with a supernatural agency.

Divination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appear to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling, divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a religious context, as seen in traditional African medicine. Fortune-telling, on the other hand, is a more everyday practice for personal purposes. Particular divination methods vary by culture and religion.

Divination is dismissed by the scientific community and skeptics as being superstition. In the 2nd century, Lucian devoted a witty essay to the career of a charlatan, &quot;Alexander the false prophet&quot;, trained by &quot;one of those who advertise enchantments, miraculous incantations, charms for your love-affairs, visitations for your enemies, disclosures of buried treasure and successions to estates&quot;.

===Witchcraft===
Witchcraft or witchery broadly means the practice of and belief in magical skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups. &quot;Witchcraft&quot; is a broad term that varies culturally and societally and thus can be difficult to define with precision, and cross-cultural assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious divinatory or medicinal role and is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view.

===Miracle===

A &quot;miracle&quot; is an event not explicable by natural or scientific laws. Such an event may be attributed to a supernatural being (a deity), a miracle worker, a saint or a religious leader.

Informally, the word &quot;miracle&quot; is often used to characterise any beneficial event that is statistically unlikely but not contrary to the laws of nature, such as surviving a natural disaster, or simply a &quot;wonderful&quot; occurrence, regardless of likelihood, such as a birth. Other such miracles might be: survival of an illness diagnosed as terminal, escaping a life-threatening situation or &#x27;beating the odds&#x27;. Some coincidences may be seen as miracles.

A true miracle would, by definition, be a non-natural phenomenon, leading many rational and scientific thinkers to dismiss them as physically impossible (that is, requiring violation of established laws of physics within their domain of validity) or impossible to confirm by their nature (because all possible physical mechanisms can never be ruled out). The former position is expressed for instance by Thomas Jefferson and the latter by David Hume. Theologians typically say that, with divine providence, God regularly works through nature yet, as a creator, is free to work without, above, or against it as well. The possibility and probability of miracles are then equal to the possibility and probability of the existence of God.

==Skepticism==

Skepticism (American English) or scepticism (British English; see spelling differences) is generally any questioning attitude or doubt towards one or more items of putative knowledge or belief. It is often directed at domains such as the supernatural, morality (moral skepticism), religion (skepticism about the existence of God), or knowledge (skepticism about the possibility of knowledge, or of certainty).

==In fiction and popular culture==

Supernatural entities and powers are common in various works of fantasy. Examples include the television shows &quot;Supernatural&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;, the magic of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series, &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; series and &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series.

<text>A hard disk drive platter or hard disk is the circular magnetic disk on which digital data is stored in a hard disk drive. The rigid nature of the platters is what gives them their name (as opposed to the flexible materials which are used to make floppy disks). Hard drives typically have several platters which are mounted on the same spindle. A platter can store information on both sides, typically requiring two recording heads per platter, one per surface.

== Design ==

The magnetic surface of each platter is divided into small sub-micrometer-sized magnetic regions, each of which is used to represent a single binary unit of information. A typical magnetic region on a hard-disk platter (as of 2006) is about 200–250 nanometers wide (in the radial direction of the platter) and extends about 25–30 nanometers in the down-track direction (the circumferential direction on the platter), corresponding to about 100 billion bits per square inch of disk area (15.5 Gbit/cm2). The material of the main &quot;magnetic medium&quot; layer is usually a cobalt-based alloy. In today&#x27;s hard drives each of these magnetic regions is composed of a few hundred magnetic grains, which are the base material that gets magnetized. As a whole, each magnetic region will have a magnetization.

One reason magnetic grains are used as opposed to a continuous magnetic medium is that they reduce the space needed for a magnetic region. In continuous magnetic materials, formations called &quot;Néel spikes&quot; tend to appear. These are spikes of opposite magnetization, and form for the same reason that bar magnets will tend to align themselves in opposite directions. These cause problems because the spikes cancel each other&#x27;s magnetic field out, so that at region boundaries, the transition from one magnetization to the other will happen over the length of the Néel spikes. This is called the transition width.

Many hard drive platters have a layer of lubricant made of amorphous carbon such as diamond-like carbon, called an overcoat, which is deposited onto the disk using sputtering, or using chemical vapor deposition. Silicon Nitride, PFPE and hydrogenated carbon have also been used as overcoats. Alternatively PFPE can be used as a lubricant on top of the overcoat.

 Granular media is oriented based on whether longitudinal or perpendicular magnetic recording is used. Ordered granular media can allow for higher storage densities than conventional granular media, and bit patterned media can succeed ordered granular media in storage density.

Grains help solve this problem because each grain is in theory a single magnetic domain (though not always in practice). This means that the magnetic domains cannot grow or shrink to form spikes, and therefore the transition width will be on the order of the diameter of the grains. Thus, much of the development in hard drives has been in reduction of grain size.

== Manufacture ==
Platters are typically made using an aluminium, glass or ceramic substrate. Laptop hard drive platters are made from glass while aluminum platters are often found in desktop computers. In disk manufacturing, a thin coating is deposited on both sides of the substrate, mostly by a vacuum deposition process called magnetron sputtering. The coating has a complex layered structure consisting of various metallic (mostly non-magnetic) alloys as underlayers, optimized for the control of the crystallographic orientation and the grain size of the actual magnetic media layer on top of them, i.e. the film storing the bits of information. On top of it a protective carbon-based overcoat is deposited in the same sputtering process. Platters typically contain several layers of materials such as a seed layer, soft magnetic under layers (SULs) that may contain Cobalt and Iron made of materials such as , an antiferromagnetic (A-FM) layer made of Nickel oxide, Nickel-Manganese or Iron-Manganese alloy, intermediate layer made of Ruthenium and a layer of Cobalt-Chromium-Palladium alloy with oxide. In post-processing a nanometer thin polymeric lubricant layer gets deposited on top of the sputtered structure by dipping the disk into a solvent solution, after which the disk is buffed by various processes to eliminate small defects and verified by a special sensor on a flying head for absence of any remaining asperities or other defects (where the size of the bit given above roughly sets the scale for what constitutes a significant defect size). In the hard-disk drive the hard-drive heads fly and move radially over the surface of the spinning platters to read or write the data. Extreme smoothness, durability, and perfection of finish are required properties of a hard-disk platter.

In February 1991, Areal Technology released the MD-2060, the first hard drive to use a glass substrate, replacing the aluminium alloys used in earlier hard drives. It was originally designed for laptops, for which the greater shock resistance of glass substrates are more suitable. Toshiba followed suit with the MK1122FC in April 1991; their factories were able to produce many more drives than Areal, which soon disappeared from the market. Around 2000, other hard drive manufacturers started transitioning from aluminum to glass platters because glass platters have several advantages over aluminum platters.

In 2005–06, a major shift in technology of hard-disk drives and of magnetic disks/media began. Originally, in-plane magnetized materials were used to store the bits, but this has now been replaced by perpendicular recording. The reason for this transition is the need to continue the trend of increasing storage densities, with perpendicularly oriented media offering a more stable solution for a decreasing bit size. Orienting the magnetization perpendicular to the disk surface has major implications for the disk&#x27;s deposited structure and the choice of magnetic materials, as well as for some of the other components of the hard-disk drive (such as the head and the electronic channel).

<text>Ashkelon or Ashqelon ( ; , ; ) is a coastal city in the Southern District of Israel on the Mediterranean coast, south of Tel Aviv, and north of the border with the Gaza Strip. 

The modern city is named after the ancient seaport of Ascalon, which was destroyed in 1270 and whose remains are on the southwestern edge of the modern metropolis. The Israeli city, first known as Migdal, was founded in 1949 approximately 4 km inland from ancient Ascalon at the Palestinian town of al-Majdal (; ). Its inhabitants had been exclusively Muslims and Christians and the area had been allocated to the Arab state in the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine; on the eve of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the inhabitants numbered 10,000 and in October 1948, the city accommodated thousands more Palestinian refugees from nearby villages. The town was conquered by Israeli forces on 5 November 1948, by which time much of the Arab population had fled, leaving some 2,700 inhabitants, of whom 500 were deported by Israeli soldiers in December 1948 and most of the rest were deported by 1950. Today, the city&#x27;s population is almost entirely Jewish. 

Migdal, as it was called in Hebrew, was initially repopulated by Jewish immigrants and demobilized soldiers. It was subsequently renamed multiple times, first as Migdal Gaza, Migdal Gad and Migdal Ashkelon, until in 1953 the coastal neighborhood of Afridar was incorporated and the name &quot;Ashkelon&quot; was adopted for the combined town. By 1961, Ashkelon was ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000. In the population of Ashkelon was , making it the third-largest city in Israel&#x27;s Southern District.

==Etymology==
The name Ashkelon is probably western Semitic, and might be connected to the triliteral root (&#x27;to weigh&#x27;, from a Semitic root , akin to Hebrew () or Arabic (), &#x27;weight&#x27;, perhaps attesting to its importance as a center for mercantile activities. Its name appeared in Phoenician and Punic as () and ().

Majdal (Arabic) and Migdal (Hebrew) mean &#x27;tower&#x27;.

The archaeological site of Ascalon, today known as Tel Ashkelon, was the oldest and largest seaport in Canaan, part of the pentapolis (a grouping of five cities) of the Philistines, north of Gaza City and south of Jaffa.

The site was an important city during the Roman, Byzantine and Early Islamic periods, and particularly during the period of the Crusades, due to its location near the coast and between the Crusader states and Egypt. The Battle of Ascalon was the last action of the First Crusade. In 1270, the Mamluk sultan Baybars ordered the fortifications and harbour at the site to be destroyed. As a result of it, the city was abandoned by its inhabitants and fell into disuse.

===Ottoman period===

The Palestinian village of Al-Jura (El-Jurah) stood northeast of and immediately adjacent to Tel Ashkelon and is documented in Ottoman tax registers. El-Jurah was depopulated during the 1948 war.

The Arab village of Majdal was mentioned by historians and tourists at the end of the 15th century. In 1596, Ottoman records showed Majdal to be a large village of 559 Muslim households, making it the 7th-most-populous locality in Palestine after Safad, Jerusalem, Gaza, Nablus, Hebron and Kafr Kanna.

An official Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that &quot;Medschdel&quot; had a total of 420 houses and a population of 1175, though the population count included men only.

===British Mandate===

In the 1922 census of Palestine, &quot;Majdal&quot; had a population of 5,064; 33 Christians and 5,031 Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 6,226 (6,166 Muslims and 41 Christians) with 172 in the suburbs (167 Muslims, 4 Christians, and one Jew).

In the 1945 statistics Majdal had a population of 9,910; ninety Christians and 9,820 Muslims, with a total (urban and rural) of 43,680 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. 2,050 dunams were public land; all the rest was owned by Arabs. of the dunams, 2,337 were used for citrus and bananas, 2,886 were plantations and irrigable land, 35,442 for cereals, while 1,346 were built-up land.

Majdal was known for its weaving industry. The town had around 500 looms in 1909. In 1920 a British Government report estimated that there were 550 cotton looms in the town with an annual output worth 30–40 million francs. But the industry suffered from imports from Europe and by 1927 only 119 weaving establishments remained. The three major fabrics produced were &quot;malak&quot; (silk), &#x27;ikhdari&#x27; (bands of red and green) and &#x27;jiljileh&#x27; (dark red bands). These were used for festival dresses throughout Southern Palestine. Many other fabrics were produced, some with poetic names such as &quot;ji&#x27;nneh u nar&quot; (&quot;heaven and hell&quot;), &quot;nasheq rohoh&quot; (&quot;breath of the soul&quot;) and &quot;abu mitayn&quot; (&quot;father of two hundred&quot;).

In addition to agriculture, residents practiced animal husbandry which formed was an important source of income for the town. In 1943, they owned 354 heads of cattle, 168 sheep over a year old, 170 goats over a year old, 65 camels, 17 horses, 39 mules, 447 donkeys, 2966 fowls, and 808 pigeons.

===State of Israel===
Majdal was occupied by the Egyptian army in the early stages of the 1948 war, along with the rest of the Gaza region that had been allocated to the Arab State in the United Nations plan. Over the next few months, the town was subjected to Israeli air-raids and shelling. All but about 1,000 of the town&#x27;s residents were forced to leave by the time it was captured by Israeli forces as a sequel to Operation Yoav on 4 November 1948. General Yigal Allon ordered the expulsion of the remaining Palestinians but the local commanders did not do so and the Arab population soon recovered to more than 2,500 due mostly to refugees slipping back and also due to the transfer of Palestinians from nearby villages. Most of them were elderly, women, or children. During the next year or so, the Palestinians were held in a confined area surrounded by barbed wire, which became commonly known as the &quot;ghetto&quot;. Moshe Dayan and Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion were in favor of expulsion, while Mapam and the Israeli labor union Histadrut objected. The government offered the Palestinians positive inducements to leave, including a favorable currency exchange, but also caused panic through night-time raids. The first group was deported to the Gaza Strip by truck on 17 August 1950 after an expulsion order had been served. The deportation was approved by Ben-Gurion and Dayan over the objections of Pinhas Lavon, secretary-general of the Histadrut, who envisioned the town as a productive example of equal opportunity. By October 1950, twenty Palestinian families remained, most of whom later moved to Lydda or Gaza. According to Israeli records, in total 2,333 Palestinians were transferred to the Gaza Strip, 60 to Jordan, 302 to other towns in Israel, and a small number remained in Ashkelon. Lavon argued that this operation dissipated &quot;the last shred of trust the Arabs had in Israel, the sincerity of the State&#x27;s declarations on democracy and civil equality, and the last remnant of confidence the Arab workers had in the Histadrut.&quot; Acting on an Egyptian complaint, the Egyptian-Israel Mixed Armistice Commission ruled that the Palestinians transferred from Majdal should be returned to Israel, but this was not done.

Majdal was granted to Israel in the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Re-population of the recently vacated Arab dwellings by Jews had been official policy since at least December 1948, but the process began slowly. The Israeli national plan of June 1949 designated al-Majdal as the site for a regional urban center of 20,000 people. From July 1949, new immigrants and demobilized soldiers moved to the new town, increasing the Jewish population to 2,500 within six months. These early immigrants were mostly from Yemen, North Africa, and Europe. 

In 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. The city began to expand as the population grew. In 1951, the neighborhood of Afridar was established for Jewish immigrants from South Africa, and in 1953 it was incorporated into the city. The current name Ashkelon was adopted and the town was granted local council status in 1953.

In 1955, Ashkelon had more than 16,000 residents. By 1961, Ashkelon ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000. This grew to 43,000 in 1972 and 53,000 in 1983. In 2005, the population was more than 106,000.

In 1949 and 1950, three immigrant transit camps (ma&#x27;abarot) were established alongside Majdal (renamed Migdal) for Jewish refugees from Arab countries, Romania and Poland. Northwest of Migdal and the immigrant camps, on the lands of the depopulated Palestinian village al-Jura, entrepreneur Zvi Segal, one of the signatories of Israel&#x27;s Declaration of Independence, established the upscale Barnea neighborhood.

A large tract of land south of Barnea was handed over to the trusteeship of the South African Zionist Federation, which established the neighborhood of Afridar. Plans for the city were drawn up in South Africa according to the garden city model. Migdal was surrounded by a broad ring of orchards. Barnea developed slowly, but Afridar grew rapidly. The first homes, built in 1951, were inhabited by new Jewish immigrants from South Africa and South America, with some native-born Israelis. The first public housing project for residents of the transit camps, the Southern Hills Project (Hageva&#x27;ot Hadromiyot) or Zion Hill (Givat Zion), was built in 1952.

Under a plan signed in October 2015, seven new neighborhoods comprising 32,000 housing units, a new stretch of highway, and three new highway interchanges will be built, turning Ashkelon into the sixth-largest city in Israel.

== Landmarks ==

=== Ashkelon National Park ===
The ancient site of Ascalon is now administered as the Ashkelon National Park. The walls that encircled the city are still visible, as well as Canaanite earth ramparts. The park contains mainly Roman, Byzantine, and Crusader ruins. The largest dog cemetery in the ancient world was discovered in Ashkelon.

A Roman burial tomb two kilometres north of Ashkelon National Park was discovered in 1937. There are two burial tombs, a painted Hellenistic cave and a Roman cave. The Hellenistic cave is decorated with paintings of nymphs, water scenes, mythological figures and animals.

=== Bathhouses ===
In 1986 ruins of 4th- to 6th-century baths were found in Ashkelon. The bathhouses are believed to have been used for prostitution. The remains of nearly 100 mostly male infants were found in a sewer under the bathhouse, leading to conjectures that prostitutes had discarded their unwanted newborns there.

=== Religious sites ===
The remains of a 4th-century Byzantine church with marble slab flooring and glass mosaic walls can be seen in the Barnea Quarter. Remains of a synagogue from this period have also been found.

==== Maqam al-Imam al-Husayn ====

An 11th-century mosque, Maqam al-Imam al-Husayn, a site of pilgrimage for both Sunni and Shia Muslims, which had been built under the Fatimids by Badr al-Jamali and where tradition held that the head of Mohammad&#x27;s grandson Hussein ibn Ali was buried, was blown up by the IDF under instructions from Moshe Dayan as part of a broader programme to destroy mosques in July 1950. The area was subsequently redeveloped for a local Israeli hospital, Barzilai. After the site was re-identified on the hospital grounds, funds from Mohammed Burhanuddin, leader of a Shi&#x27;a Ismaili sect based in India, were used to construct a small marble prayer platform, which is visited by Shi&#x27;ite pilgrims from India and Pakistan.

A domed structure housing the 13th-century tomb of Sheikh Awad sits atop a hill overlooking Ashkelon&#x27;s northern beaches.

=== Museums ===
Ashkelon Khan and Museum contains archaeological finds, among them a replica of Ashkelon&#x27;s Canaanite silver calf, whose discovery was reported on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The Outdoor Museum near the municipal cultural center displays two Roman burial coffins made of marble depicting battle and hunting scenes, and famous mythological scenes.

=== Marina and water park ===
The Ashkelon Marina, located between Delila and Bar Kochba beaches, offers a shipyard and repair services. Ashkeluna is a water-slide park on Ashkelon beach.

== Palestinians and Ashkelon ==

=== Origins of Hamas ===

Most of the founding members of Hamas were born in Mandatory Palestine, outside of the Gaza strip, or have parents who were. Many of them were from villages that were in the vicinity of present-day Ashkelon, including most of the party&#x27;s leaders:

* Founding leader Ahmed Yassin was born in Al-Jura.

* Yassin&#x27;s successor Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi was born in Yibna. 

* The father of Faiq and Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh was from Bayt Tima.

* Ismail Haniyeh&#x27;s parents migrated from Al-Jura to Gaza in 1948.

* Yahya Sinwar was born in the Khan Yunis in Egyptian-occupied Gaza in 1962 to a family who left Ashkelon (then called Al-Majdal) during the 1948 Palestine War.

* One of few exceptions is Khaled Mashal, who was born in Silwad, in the Jordanian occupied West Bank.

=== Palestinian conflict with modern Ashkelon ===

On 1–2 March 2008, rockets fired by Hamas from the Gaza Strip (some of them Grad rockets) hit Ashkelon, wounding seven, and causing property damage. Mayor Roni Mahatzri stated that &quot;This is a state of war, I know no other definition for it. If it lasts a week or two, we can handle that, but we have no intention of allowing this to become part of our daily routine.&quot; In March 2008, 230 buildings and 30 cars were damaged by rocket fire on Ashkelon.

On 12 May 2008, a rocket fired from the northern Gazan city of Beit Lahiya hit a shopping mall in southern Ashkelon, causing significant structural damage. According to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, four people were seriously injured and 87 were treated for shock. Fifteen people suffered minor to moderate injuries as a result of the collapsed structure. Southern District Police chief Uri Bar-Lev believed the Grad-model Katyusha rocket was manufactured in Iran.

In March 2009, a Qassam rocket hit a school, destroying classrooms and injuring two people.

In November 2014, the mayor, Itamar Shimoni, began a policy of discrimination against Arab workers, refusing to allow them to work on city projects to build bomb shelters for children. His discriminatory actions brought criticism from others, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat who likened the discrimination to the anti-Semitism experienced by Jews in Europe 70 years earlier.

On May 11, 2021, Hamas fired 137 rockets on Ashkelon killing 2 and injuring many others.

On October 10, 2023, during the Israel–Hamas war, Abu Obaida, spokesperson for Hamas, warned all citizens of Ashkelon to evacuate before 5:00 P.M. local time via a post to his Telegram channel. Once the deadline hit, Hamas launched a barrage of missiles towards Ashkelon.

== Demographics ==
In the early years, the city was primarily inhabited by Mizrahi Jews, who fled to Israel after being expelled from Muslim lands. Today, Mizrahi Jews still constitute the majority of the population. In the early 1950s, many South African Jews settled in Ashkelon, establishing the Afridar neighbourhood. They were followed by an influx of immigrants from the United Kingdom. During the 1990s, the city received additional arrivals of Ethiopian Jews and Russian Jews.

== Ashkelon today ==

=== Economy ===
Ashkelon is the northern terminus for the Trans-Israel pipeline, which brings petroleum products from Eilat to an oil terminal at the port. The Ashkelon seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant is the largest in the world. The project was developed as a BOT (build–operate–transfer) by a consortium of three international companies: Veolia water, IDE Technologies and Elran. In March 2006, it was voted &quot;Desalination Plant of the Year&quot; in the Global Water Awards.

Since 1992, Israel Beer Breweries has been operating in Ashkelon, brewing Carlsberg and Tuborg beer for the Israeli market.

=== Culture and sports ===

The Ashkelon Sports Arena opened in 1999. The &quot;Jewish Eye&quot; is a Jewish world film festival that takes place annually in Ashkelon. The festival marked its seventh year in 2010. The Breeza Music Festival has been held yearly in and around Ashkelon&#x27;s amphitheatre since 1992. Most of the musical performances are free. Israel Lacrosse operates substantial youth lacrosse programs in the city and recently hosted the Turkey men&#x27;s national team in Israel&#x27;s first home international in 2013.

=== Health care ===
Ashkelon and environs is served by the Barzilai Medical Center, established in 1961. It was built in place of Hussein ibn Ali&#x27;s 11th-century mosque, a center of Muslim pilgrimages, destroyed by the Israeli army in 1950. Situated from Gaza, the hospital has been the target of numerous Qassam rocket attacks, sometimes as many as 140 over one weekend. The hospital plays a vital role in treating wounded soldiers and terror victims. A rocket and missile-proof emergency room opened in February 2018.

=== Education ===

The city has 19 elementary schools, and nine junior high and high schools. The Ashkelon Academic College opened in 1998, and now hosts thousands of students. Harvard University operates an archaeological summer school program in Ashkelon.

<text>Gaza, also called Gaza City, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, southwest of Jerusalem, it is home to Palestine&#x27;s only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza was the most populous city in the State of Palestine prior to the Gaza war, when it was subjected to massive displacement.

Inhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893.

Gaza fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Gaza was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET&quot;&gt;Gaza Benefiting From Israel Easing Economic Blockade&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IBRAHIM BARZAK 06/21/11 08:13 AM ET&quot;&gt;Gaza Border Opening Brings Little Relief&lt;/ref&gt; The city was largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the start of the Gaza war in October 2023.

The primary economic activities of Gaza are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza&#x27;s Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of 03 2025, almost all residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel&#x27;s actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Gaza&quot; first appears in military records of Thothmes III of Egypt in the 15th century BC, and was mentioned in the Amarna correspondence as and other variant spellings. In Neo-Assyrian sources, reflecting the late Philistine period, it was known as &quot;Hāzat&quot;. It is clear the name originates from none of these languages, however.

Based on the city&#x27;s modern Hebrew name, , a common folk etymology insists the name stems from the Hebrew root &quot;ʻayin&quot;-&quot;zayin&quot;-&quot;zayin&quot;, from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived, but this is unlikely. The in the root corresponds to a Proto-Semitic *&quot;ʻ&quot; sound (compare Hebrew with Arabic , both meaning &quot;to be strong, powerful, mighty&quot;), while it is clear from city&#x27;s name in Arabic (, ), Greek (, ), and Egyptian () that the name of Gaza was likely originally pronounced with an initial // sound in Hebrew, and thus can&#x27;t have been from the same root as .

Historically, Muslims often referred to the city as &quot;Ḡazzat Hāŝim&quot; in honor of Hashim, the great-grandfather of Muhammad who, according to Islamic tradition, is buried in the city.

== History ==
Gaza&#x27;s history of habitation dates back 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world. Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant, for most of its history it served as a key entrepôt of southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea.

===Early history===
Settlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory at Tell es-Sakan, to the south of present-day Gaza. The site went into decline throughout the Early Bronze Age II as its trade with Egypt sharply decreased. Another urban center known as Tell el-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the Middle Bronze Age, a revived Tell es-Sakan became the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort. In 1650 BC, when the Canaanite Hyksos occupied Egypt, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BC, at the end of the Bronze Age.

During the reign of Tuthmosis III (r. 1479–1425 BC), the city became a stop on the Syrian-Egyptian caravan route and was mentioned in the 14th-century Amarna letters as &quot;Azzati&quot;. Gaza later served as Egypt&#x27;s administrative capital in Canaan. Gaza remained under Egyptian control for 350 years until it was conquered by the Philistines in the 12th century BC. In the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the Philistine &quot;pentapolis&quot;. Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the Persian Empire.

===Hellenistic period ===

Alexander the Great besieged Gaza, the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before capturing it 332 BC; the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive. Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a &quot;polis&quot; (or &quot;city-state&quot;).

In Seleucid times, Seleucus I Nicator or one of his successors renamed Gaza into Seleucia to control the surrounding area against the Ptolemies. Greek culture consequently took root and Gaza earned a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenistic learning and philosophy. During the Third War of the Diadochi, Ptolemy I Soter defeated Demetrius I of Macedon in a battle near Gaza in 312 BC. In 277 BC, following Ptolemy II&#x27;s successful campaign against the Nabataeans the Ptolemaic fortress of Gaza took control of the spice trade with Gerrha and Southern Arabia.

Gaza experienced another siege in 96 BC by the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus who &quot;utterly overthrew&quot; the city, killing 500 senators who had fled into the temple of Apollo.

===Roman period ===

Josephus notes that Gaza was resettled under the rule of Antipater, who cultivated friendly relations with Gazans, Ascalonites and neighboring cities after being appointed governor of Idumaea by Jannaeus.

Rebuilt after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BC under the command of Pompey Magnus, Gaza then became a part of the Roman province of Judaea. It was targeted by Jewish forces during their rebellion against Roman rule in 66 and was partially destroyed. It nevertheless remained an important city, even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem during the First Jewish–Roman War. Following this, and again at the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), captives were sold into slavery in Gaza.

Throughout the Roman period, Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors. A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians, Jews, Egyptians, Persians, and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza&#x27;s mint issued coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors. During his visit in 130 AD, Emperor Hadrian personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing, and oratorical competitions in Gaza&#x27;s new stadium. The city was adorned with many pagan temples; the main cult being that of Marnas. Other temples were dedicated to Zeus, Helios, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena and the local Tyche. Christianity began to spread throughout Gaza in 250 AD, including in the port of Maiuma.
First evidence of a Bishop of Gaza is from early 4th century, when St. Sylvan served in that capacity.

===Byzantine period ===
Following the division of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century AD, Gaza remained under control of the Eastern Roman Empire that in turn became the Byzantine Empire. The city prospered and was an important center for the southern Palestine. A Christian bishopric was established at Gaza. Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city&#x27;s pagan temples destroyed, and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas. It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza, his hometown, &quot;the Athens of Asia.&quot; A large synagogue existed in Gaza in the 6th century, according to excavations.

===Early Islamic period===
In Gaza was captured by Arab Muslim forces under Amr ibn al-As, in the years following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It was captured by Amr&#x27;s forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad&#x27;s great-grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by Amr&#x27;s army despite the city&#x27;s stiff and lengthy resistance, though its Byzantine garrison was massacred.

The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city), which was later rebuilt by Sultan Baibars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century. A large segment of the population swiftly adopted Islam, and Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi&#x27;i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi&#x27;i religious code, one of the four major Sunni Muslim schools of law (&quot;fiqh&quot;). Security, which was well-maintained during early Muslim rule, was the key to Gaza&#x27;s prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain wine production, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported mainly to Egypt.

Because it bordered the desert, Gaza was vulnerable to warring nomadic groups. In 796 it was destroyed during a civil war between the Arab tribes of the area. However, by the 10th century, the city had been rebuilt by the Abbasids; during Abbasid rule, the geographer al-Muqaddasi described Gaza as &quot;a large town lying on the highroad to Egypt on the border of the desert.&quot; In 978, the Fatimids established an agreement with Alptakin, the Turk ruler of Damascus, whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it, including Egypt, while Alptakin controlled the region north of the city.

===Crusader and Ayyubid periods===
The Crusaders conquered Gaza in 1100 and King Baldwin III built a castle in the city for the Knights Templar in 1149. He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John. In 1154, Arab traveller al-Idrisi wrote that Gaza &quot;is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.&quot; In 1187 the Ayyubids, led by Sultan Saladin, captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city&#x27;s fortifications. Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city in 1192, but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the Treaty of Ramla in 1193. Ayyubid rule ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza, which became his southernmost conquest.

===Mamluk period===
Following Gaza&#x27;s destruction by the Mongols, Muslim slave-soldiers based in Egypt known as the Mamluks began to administer the area. In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, &quot;Mamlakat Ghazzah&quot; (Governorship of Gaza). This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills. Other major towns in the province included Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290. In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks. Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a &quot;city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land.&quot; Under the governorship of Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, Gaza was transformed into a flourishing city and much of the Mamluk-era architecture dates back to his reign between 1311 and 1320 and again in 1342. In 1348 the bubonic plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants and in 1352, Gaza suffered from a destructive flood, which was rare in that arid part of Palestine. However, when Arab writer Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1355, he noted that it was &quot;large and populous, and has many mosques.&quot; The Mamluks contributed to Gazan architecture by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths.

The Mamluks allowed Jews to return to the city, after being expelled by the Crusaders, and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the Mamluk period, the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine, after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem. In 1481, an Italian Jewish traveller, Meshulam of Volterra, wrote of Gaza:It is a fine and renowned place, and its fruits are very renowned and good. Bread and good wine is to be found there, but only Jews make wine. Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls. It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill. It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea, and there are about fifty (sixty) Jewish householders, artisans. They have a small but pretty Synagogue, and vineyards and fields and houses.

===Ottoman period===

In 1516 Gaza—at the time, a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade—was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims. The city was then made the capital of the Gaza Sanjak, part of the larger Province of Damascus. The Ridwan family, named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century. Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan, the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, who was based in the nearby town of al-Ramla.

According to Theodore E. Dowling, writing in 1913, a Samaritan community existed in Gaza in 1584. They possessed a large synagogue and two bathhouses. &quot;One of them still bears the name &quot;the Bath of the Samaritans.&quot; It is believed the Samaritans were expelled from the city before the turn of the 16th century.

During the rule of Husayn Pasha, strife between the settled population and the nearby Bedouin tribes was dramatically reduced, allowing Gaza to peacefully prosper. The Ridwan period is described as a golden age for Gaza, a time when it served as the virtual &quot;capital of Palestine.&quot; The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while Turkish baths and market stalls proliferated. After the death of Musa Pasha, Husayn&#x27;s successor, Ottoman officials were appointed to govern in place of the Ridwans. The Ridwan period was Gaza&#x27;s last golden age during Ottoman rule. After the family was removed from office, the city gradually declined.

Starting in the early 19th century, Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered Gaza in 1832. American scholar Edward Robinson visited the city in 1838, describing it as a &quot;thickly populated&quot; town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain. The city benefited from trade and commerce because of its strategic position on the caravan route between Egypt and northern Syria as well as from producing soap and cotton for trade with the government, local Arab tribes, and the Bedouin of Wadi Arabah and Ma&#x27;an. The bazaars of Gaza were well-supplied and were noted by Robinson as &quot;far better&quot; than those of Jerusalem. Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza&#x27;s vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation. By the mid-19th century, Gaza&#x27;s port was eclipsed by the ports of Jaffa and Haifa, but it retained its fishing fleet.

The bubonic plague struck Gaza again in 1839 and the city, lacking political and economic stability, went into a state of stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza.

During the late Ottoman period, British ships docking in Gaza were loaded with barley, which was primarily intended for marketing in Scotland for whisky production. Due to the absence of a British consular agent, precise data on the financial value and quantities of the goods are unavailable.

===Stages of conflict and occupation===

While leading the Allied Forces during World War I, the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction.

In the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned to be part of an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza&#x27;s growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees from nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.

Gaza was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War following the defeat of the Egyptian Army. Frequent conflicts have erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s. The tensions led to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising, and economic conditions in the city worsened.

===Palestinian control===
In September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.

In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip and removed the thousands of Israelis who had settled in the territory. (&quot;See&quot; Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan of 2004.) Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organisation Fatah. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has &quot;de facto&quot; control of the city and Strip.

In March 2008, a coalition of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel&#x27;s military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians were killed in the conflict.

In November 2012, after a week of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on November 21. In the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed, according to UN OCHA. During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the 13-story Hanadi Tower, which contained a political office of Hamas, was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike.

In 2023, the city was again targeted during the Gaza war. On 2 November, the siege of Gaza City started. As of January 2024, Israel’s offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70–80% of all buildings in northern Gaza. Gaza was left largely deserted, with about only 300,000 people staying in the city. The remaining population was subjected to a humanitarian crisis and starvation brought on by the war. Seventy percent of the city was destroyed by airstrikes, and more than 39,000 people were killed in the Strip. Israel has been accused of committing a genocide of Palestinians in Gaza during the war, with South Africa initiating proceedings at the International Court of Justice against Israel.

== Geography ==

Central Gaza is situated on a low-lying and round hill with an elevation of above sea level. Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill, especially to the north and east, forming Gaza&#x27;s suburbs. The beach and the port of Gaza are located west of the city&#x27;s nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low-lying hills.

The municipal jurisdiction of the city today constitutes about . Gaza is southwest of Jerusalem, south of Tel Aviv, and north of Rafah. Surrounding localities include Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, and Jabalia to the north, and the village of Abu Middein, the refugee camp of Bureij, and the city of Deir al-Balah to the south.

The population of Gaza depends on groundwater as the only source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears a small amount of water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.

A prominent hill southeast of Gaza, known as Tell al-Muntar, has an elevation of above sea level. For centuries it has been claimed as the place to which Samson brought the city gates of the Philistines. The hill is crowned by a Muslim shrine (&quot;maqam&quot;) dedicated to Ali al-Muntar. There are old Muslim graves around the surrounding trees, and the lintel of the doorway of the &quot;maqam&quot; has two medieval Arabic scriptures.

=== Old City ===

The Old City forms the main part of Gaza&#x27;s nucleus. It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern Daraj Quarter (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern Zaytun Quarter (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters.) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures. The ancient part of the Old City is about .

There were seven historic gates to the Old City: Bab Asqalan (Gate of Ascalon), Bab al-Darum (Gate of Deir al-Balah), Bab al-Bahr (Gate of the Sea), Bab Marnas (Gate of Marnas), Bab al-Baladiyah (Gate of the Town), Bab al-Khalil (Gate of Hebron), and Bab al-Muntar (Gate of Tell al-Muntar).

Some of the older buildings in Gaza&#x27;s Old City use the &quot;ablaq&quot; style of decoration which features alternating layers of red and white masonry, prevalent in the Mamluk era. Daraj contains the Gold (Qissariya) Market as well as the Great Mosque of Gaza (oldest mosque in Gaza) and the Sayed al-Hashim Mosque. In Zaytun lies the Saint Porphryrius Church, the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque, and Hamam as-Sammara (&quot;the Samaritan&#x27;s Bathhouse.&quot;)

=== Districts ===
Gaza is composed of thirteen districts (&quot;hayy&quot;) outside of the Old City. The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja&#x27;iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period. In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City&#x27;s walls.

During the 1930s and 1940s, a new residential district, Rimal (currently divided into the districts of Northern Rimal and Southern Rimal), was constructed on the sand dunes west of the city center, and the district of Zeitoun was built along Gaza&#x27;s southern and southwestern borders, while the Judeide (&quot;the New&quot;) and Turukman neighborhoods of Shuja&#x27;iyya expanded into separate districts in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Judeide (also known Shuja&#x27;iyyat al-Akrad) was named after the Kurdish military units who settled there during the Mamluk era, while Turukman was named after the Turkmen military units who settled there.

The areas between Rimal and the Old City became the districts of Sabra and Daraj. In the northwest is the district of Nasser, built in the early 1950s and named in honor of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. The district of Sheikh Radwan, developed in the 1970s, is to the north of the Old City and is named after Sheikh Radwan—the tomb of whom is located within the district. Gaza has absorbed the village of al-Qubbah near the border with Israel, as well as the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Shati along the coast, although the latter is not under the city&#x27;s municipal jurisdiction. In the late 1990s, the PNA built the more affluent neighborhood of Tel al-Hawa along the southern edge of Rimal. Along the southern coast of the city is the neighborhood of Sheikh Ijlin.

=== Climate ===
Gaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;), with Mediterranean characteristics, featuring mild rainy winters and dry hot summers. Spring arrives around March or April and the hottest month is August, with the average high being . The coolest month is January with temperatures usually peaking at . Rain is scarce and falls almost exclusively between November and March, with annual rainfall totalling approximately .
== Demographics ==

=== Population ===
According to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers. The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza&#x27;s Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons. In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 &quot;jundiyan&quot; or &quot;soldiers&quot; in the Ottoman army. Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households. In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad.

In 1838, there were roughly 4,000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers, implying a population of about 15,000 or 16,000—making it larger than Jerusalem at the time. The total number of Christian families was 57. Before the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gaza had reached 42,000; however, the fierce battles between Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease. The following census, which was conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities shows a sharp decrease in population which stood at 17,480 residents (16,722 Muslims, 701 Christians, 54 Jews and three Metawilehs). The 1931 census lists 17,046 inhabitants (16,356 Muslims, 689 Christians, and one Jew) and another 4,597 in the suburbs (4,561 Muslims and 36 Christians).

The village statistics of 1938 list Gaza&#x27;s population as 20,500 with 5,282 in nearby suburbs. The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 34,250 (33,160 Muslims, 1,010 Christians, and 80 Jews).

According to a 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Gaza and the adjacent al-Shati camp had a population of 353,115, of which 50.9% were males and 49.1% females. Gaza had an overwhelmingly young population with more than half being 19 and under (60.8%). About 28.8% were between the ages of 20 and 44, 7.7% between 45 and 64, and 3.9% were over the age of 64.
A massive influx of Palestinian refugees swelled Gaza&#x27;s population after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population had grown to about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza&#x27;s inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city&#x27;s population has continued to increase since that time to 590,481 in 2017, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City has one of the highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km2 (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km2 – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km2 – 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid.

=== Religion ===
The population of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam. During the Fatimid period, Shia Islam was dominant in Gaza, but after Saladin conquered the city in 1187, he promoted a strictly Sunni religious and educational policy, which at the time was instrumental in uniting his Arab and Turkish soldiers.

Gaza is home to a small Palestinian Christian minority of about 3,500 people. The majority live in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City and belong to the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Baptist denominations. In 1906, there were about 750 Christians, of which 700 were Orthodox and 50 were Roman Catholic.

Gaza&#x27;s Jewish community was roughly 3,000 years old, and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households. At the time of the 1929 Palestine riots, there were fifty families living in Gaza, most of whom fled after the riots. In Sami Hadawi&#x27;s land and population survey, Gaza had a population of 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust between them and the Arab majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.

== Economy ==

The major agricultural products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water have reduced the productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza&#x27;s street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.

A report by human rights and development groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza&#x27;s industrial operations were suspended due to lack of access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed with tens of thousands of laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.

Gaza&#x27;s food prices rose during the blockade, with wheat flour going up 34%, rice up 21%, and baby powder up 30%. In 2007, households spent an average of 62% of their total income on food, compared to 37% in 2004. In less than a decade, the number of families depending on UNRWA food aid increased tenfold. In 2008, 80% of the population relied on humanitarian aid in 2008 compared to 63% in 2006. According to a report by OXFAM in 2009, Gaza suffered from a serious shortage of housing, educational facilities, health facilities and infrastructure, along with an inadequate sewage system that contributed to hygiene and public health problems.

Following a significant easing of the closure policy in 2010, the economy of Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels during the height of the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, and UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.

Presence of hydrocarbon reserves around the region gives potential to Gaza, to develop as a leading industrial center. Many of the region’s gas and oil fields are underneath Gaza. In 1999, natural gas reserves were discovered, offshore of the territory, known as Gaza Marine. It holds of natural gas, as a part of the Levant Basin, which itself holds of natural gas. The Levant Basin on the Mediterranean Sea, which includes coastal regions of Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, is estimated to have of oil. Gaza is the only coastal part of the State of Palestine. In 2000, exploration license were granted by the government to British Gas Group. However, the project was interrupted during the 2000–2005 uprisings, where supportive infrastructure, the seaport and airport was destroyed by Israel. In 2023, the work gain momentum again, until it was crashed in the ongoing war. A large number of people used to believe that, Gaza&#x27;s oil and gas reserves is the reason for Israel&#x27;s offensive on the territory, also described as a potential genocidal campaign.

== Culture ==

=== Cultural centers and museums ===

The Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, located in Rimal, was completed in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa. A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library. The French Cultural Center is a symbol of French partnership and cooperation in Gaza. It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities. Whenever possible, French artists are invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions.

Established in 1998, the Arts and Crafts Village is a children&#x27;s cultural center with the objectives of promoting comprehensive, regular and periodic documentation of creative art. It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art, ceramics, graphics, carvings and others. Nearly 10,000 children from throughout the Gaza Strip have benefited from the Arts and Crafts Village.

The Gaza Theater, financed by contributions from Norway, opened in 2004. The theater does not receive much funding from the PNA, depending mostly on donations from foreign aid agencies. The A. M. Qattan Foundation, a Palestinian arts charity, runs several workshops in Gaza to develop young artistic talent and impart drama skills to teachers. The Gaza Theater Festival was inaugurated in 2005.

The Gaza Museum of Archaeology opened in the summer of 2008. The museum collection features thousands of items, including a statue of a full-breasted Aphrodite in a diaphanous gown, images of other ancient deities and oil lamps featuring menorahs.

=== Cuisine ===

Gaza&#x27;s cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played a role in many of the city&#x27;s simple meatless dishes and stews, such as &quot;saliq wa adas&quot; (&quot;chard and lentils&quot;) and &quot;bisara&quot; (fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).

Seafood is a key aspect of Gaza life and a local staple, Some well-known seafood dishes include &quot;zibdiyit gambari&quot;, literally, &quot;shrimps in a clay pot&quot;, and &quot;shatta&quot; which are crabs stuffed with red hot chili pepper dip, then baked in the oven. Fish is either fried or grilled after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, chillies and cumin, and marinated with various spices. It is also a key ingredient in &quot;sayyadiya&quot;, rice cooked with caramelized onions, a generous amount of whole garlic cloves, large chunks of well-marinated fried fish, and spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, and cumin. Many of the 1948-era refugees were &quot;fellahin&quot; (&quot;peasants&quot;) who ate seasonal foods. &quot;Sumaghiyyeh&quot;, popular in Gaza not just on Ramadan but all year round, is a mixture of sumac, tahina and water combined with chard, chunks of beef and chickpeas. The dish is topped with crushed dill seeds, chillies and fried garlic and served in bowls. &quot;Maftool&quot; is a wheat-based dish flavored with dried sour plums that is served like couscous or shaped into little balls and steamed over stew or soup.

Most Gaza restaurants are located in the Rimal district. Al-Andalus, which specializes in fish and seafood, is popular with tourists, as are al-Sammak and the upscale Roots Club. Atfaluna is a stylish restaurant near Gaza port run and staffed by deaf people with the goal of building a society that is more accepting of people with disabilities.

Throughout the Old City there are street stalls that sell cooked beans, hummus, roasted sweet potatoes, falafel, and kebabs. Coffee houses (&quot;qahwa&quot;) serve Arabic coffee and tea. Gaza&#x27;s well-known sweet shops, Saqqala and Arafat, sell common Arab sweet products and are located off Wehda Street. Alcohol is a rarity, found only in the United Nations Beach Club.

=== Costumes and embroidery ===
Gauze is reputed to have originated in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza &quot;thob&quot; was often woven at nearby Majdal. Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. &quot;Thobs&quot; here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (&quot;muqass&quot;), combs (&quot;mushut&quot;) and triangles (&quot;hijab&quot;) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.

Circa 1990, Hamas and other Islamic movements sought to increase the use of the &quot;hijab&quot; (&quot;headscarf&quot;) among Gazan women, especially urban and educated women, and the &quot;hijab&quot; styles since introduced have varied according to class and group identity.

=== Sports ===
Palestine Stadium, the Palestinian national stadium, is located in Gaza and has a capacity for 10,000 people. Gaza has several local football teams that participate in the Gaza Strip League. They include Khidmat al-Shatia (al-Shati Camp), Ittihad al-Shuja&#x27;iyya (Shuja&#x27;iyya neighborhood), Gaza Sports Club, and al-Zeitoun (Zeitoun neighborhood).

== Governance ==

Today, Gaza serves as the administrative capital of the Gaza Governorate. It contains the currently defunct Palestinian Legislative Council building.

The first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa. Modern mayorship, however, began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by the Ottoman authorities. Al-Shawa oversaw the construction of Gaza&#x27;s first hospital, several new mosques and schools, the restoration of the Great Mosque, and the introduction of the modern plow to the city. In 1922, British colonial secretary Winston Churchill requested that Gaza develop its own constitution under Mandatory Palestine. However, it was rejected by the Palestinians.

On July 24, 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza the first city council in the Palestinian territories. The 2005 Palestinian municipal elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won the majority of seats in seven of the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes between the two parties that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.

Normally, Palestinian municipalities with populations over 20,000 and that serve as administrative centers have municipal councils consisting of fifteen members, including the mayor. The current municipal council of Gaza, however, consists of fourteen members, including the installed by Hamas mayor, Nizar Hijazi.

== Education ==

According to the PCBS, in 1997, approximately over 90% of Gaza&#x27;s population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city&#x27;s population, 140,848 were enrolled in schools (39.8% in elementary school, 33.8% in secondary school, and 26.4% in high school). About 11,134 people received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas.

In 2006, there were 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools. A total of 154,251 students were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in the Gaza Strip severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in the Gaza Strip revealed that there was a nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology or science labs, and extra curricular activities.

=== Universities ===
Gaza has many universities. The four main universities in the city are al-Azhar University – Gaza, al-Quds Open University, al-Aqsa University and the Islamic University of Gaza. The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded by a group of businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza. It had an enrollment of 20,639 students. Al-Azhar is generally secular and was founded in 1992. Al-Aqsa University was established in 1991. Al-Quds Open University established its Gaza Educational Region campus in 1992 in a rented building in the center of the city originally with 730 students. Because of the rapid increase of the number of students, it constructed the first university owned building in the Nasser District. In 2006–07, it had an enrollment of 3,778 students.

=== Public library ===
The Public Library of Gaza is located off Wehda Street and has a collection of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French. A total area of about , the building consists of two floors and a basement. The library was opened in 1999 after cooperation dating from 1996 by Gaza under mayor Aoun Shawa, the municipality of Dunkerque, and the World Bank. The library&#x27;s primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions.

== Landmarks ==


Landmarks in Gaza include the Great Mosque in the Old City. Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines, then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs. The Crusaders transformed it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza&#x27;s reconquest by the Muslims. It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip.

Other mosques in the Old City include the Mamluk-era Sayed Hashem Mosque that believed to house the tomb of Hashem ibn Abd al-Manaf in its dome. There is also the nearby Kateb al-Welaya Mosque that dates back to 1334. In Shuja&#x27;iyya is the Ibn Uthman Mosque, which was built by Nablus native Ahmad ibn Uthman in 1402, and the Mahkamah Mosque built by Mamluk majordomo Birdibak al-Ashrafi in 1455. In Tuffah is the Ibn Marwan Mosque, which was built in 1324 and houses the tomb of Ali ibn Marwan, a holy man.

The Unknown Soldier&#x27;s Square, located in Rimal, is a monument dedicated to an unknown Palestinian fighter who died in the 1948 War. In 1967, the monument was torn down by Israeli forces and remained a patch of sand, until a public garden was built there with funding from Norway. Qasr al-Basha, originally a Mamluk-era villa that was used by Napoleon during his brief sojourn in Gaza, is located in the Old City and is today a girls&#x27; school. The Commonwealth Gaza War Cemetery, often referred to as the British War Cemetery, contains the graves of fallen Allied soldiers in World War I; it sits northeast of the city center, in the Tuffah district, near Salah al-Din Road.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Water supply and sanitation ===
According to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 98.1% of Gaza&#x27;s residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system. About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit. The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city&#x27;s water supply. The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis. The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through &quot;salty wells&quot; because of the unavailability of electricity. About 20 million liters of raw sewage and 40 million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, and untreated sewage bred insects and mice.
As a &quot;water-poor&quot; country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza. The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza&#x27;s main resource for obtaining quality water. However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem.

=== Power grid ===
In 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by Enron. However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006. Prior to the power plant&#x27;s destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation. The plant was partially rebuilt by December 2007, and Israeli electricity continues to be sold to Gaza.

=== Solid waste management ===
Solid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.

For instance, the scale of damage resulting from the Operation Protective Edge is unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2 million tonnes of debris was generated. Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge. More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds. In January 2024, the Israeli army destroyed Gaza City’s main reservoirs, Al-Balad and Al-Rimal.

== Health care ==

Al-Shifa Hospital (&quot;the Cure&quot;) was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city&#x27;s central hospital. When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital. Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza&#x27;s largest medical complex.

Throughout the late 1950s, a new health administration, Bandar Gaza (&quot;Gaza Region&quot;), was established and headed by Haidar Abdel-Shafi. Bandar Gaza rented several rooms throughout the city to set up government clinics that provided essential curative care.

The Ahli Arab Hospital, founded in 1907 by the Church Missionary Society (CMS), was destroyed in World War I. It was rebuilt after the war by the CMS, and in 1955 became the Southern Baptist Hospital. In 1982, the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem took leadership and the original name was restored. Al-Quds Hospital, located in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood and managed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society, is the second largest hospital in Gaza.

In 2007, hospitals experienced power cuts lasting for 8–12 hours daily and diesel required for power generators was in short supply. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of patients given permits to exit Gaza for medical care decreased from 89.3% in January 2007 to 64.3% in December 2007.

In 2010, a team of doctors from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of training at the cystic fibrosis clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Upon their return to Gaza, a cystic fibrosis center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.

Al-Rantisi Hospital provides care for children.

== Transportation ==

The Rasheed Coastal Road runs along Gaza&#x27;s coastline and connects it with the rest of Gaza Strip&#x27;s coastline north and south. The main highway of the Gaza Strip, Salah al-Din Road (the modern Via Maris) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, and Rafah in the south and Jabalia and Beit Hanoun in the north. The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the Erez Crossing and the crossing into Egypt is the Rafah Crossing.

Omar Mukhtar Street is the main road in the city running north–south, branching off Salah ad-Din Street, stretching from the Rimal coastline and the Old City where it ends at the Gold Market. Prior to the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, there existed regular lines of collective taxis to Ramallah and Hebron in the West Bank. Except for private cars, Gaza City is served by taxis and buses.

The Yasser Arafat International Airport near Rafah opened in 1998 south of Gaza. Its runways and facilities were damaged by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2001 and 2002, rendering the airport unusable. In 2010, the tarmac ramp was destroyed by Palestinians seeking stones and recycled building materials. The Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel is located roughly northeast of the city.

<text>Computer operating systems (OSes) provide a set of functions needed and used by most application programs on a computer, and the links needed to control and synchronize computer hardware. On the first computers, with no operating system, every program needed the full hardware specification to run correctly and perform standard tasks, and its own drivers for peripheral devices like printers and punched paper card readers. The growing complexity of hardware and application programs eventually made operating systems a necessity for everyday use.

==Background==
Early computers lacked any form of operating system. Instead, the user, also called the operator, had sole use of the machine for a scheduled period of time. The operator would arrive at the computer with program and data which needed to be loaded into the machine before the program could be run. Loading of program and data was accomplished in various ways including toggle switches, punched paper cards and magnetic or paper tape. Once loaded, the machine would be set to execute the single program until that program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a control panel using dials, toggle switches and panel lights, making it a very manual and error-prone process.

Symbolic languages, assemblers, compilers were developed for programmers to translate symbolic program code into machine code that previously would have been hand-encoded. Later machines came with libraries of support code on punched cards or magnetic tape, which would be linked to the user&#x27;s program to assist in operations such as input and output. This was the genesis of the modern-day operating system; however, machines still ran a single program or job at a time. At Cambridge University in England the job queue was at one time a string from which tapes attached to corresponding job tickets were hung with stationery pegs.

As machines became more powerful the time to run programs diminished, and the time to hand off the equipment to the next user became large by comparison. Accounting for and paying for machine usage moved on from checking the wall clock to automatic logging by the computer. Run queues evolved from a literal queue of people at the door, to a heap of media on a jobs-waiting table, or batches of punched cards stacked one on top of the other in the reader, until the machine itself was able to select and sequence which magnetic tape drives processed which tapes. Where program developers had originally had access to run their own jobs on the machine, they were supplanted by dedicated machine operators who looked after the machine and were less and less concerned with implementing tasks manually. When commercially available computer centers were faced with the implications of data lost through tampering or operational errors, equipment vendors were put under pressure to enhance the runtime libraries to prevent misuse of system resources. Automated monitoring was needed not just for CPU usage but for counting pages printed, cards punched, cards read, disk storage used and for signaling when operator intervention was required by jobs such as changing magnetic tapes and paper forms. Security features were added to operating systems to record audit trails of which programs were accessing which files and to prevent access to a production payroll file by an engineering program, for example.

All these features were building up towards the repertoire of a fully capable operating system. Eventually the runtime libraries became an amalgamated program that was started before the first customer job and could read in the customer job, control its execution, record its usage, reassign hardware resources after the job ended, and immediately go on to process the next job. These resident background programs, capable of managing multi step processes, were often called monitors or monitor-programs before the term &quot;operating system&quot; established itself.

An underlying program offering basic hardware management, software scheduling and resource monitoring may seem a remote ancestor to the user-oriented OSes of the personal computing era. But there has been a shift in the meaning of OS. Just as early automobiles lacked speedometers, radios, and air conditioners which later became standard, more and more optional software features became standard in every OS package. This has led to the perception of an OS as a complete user system with an integrated graphical user interface, utilities, and some applications such as file managers, text editors, and configuration tools.

The true descendant of the early operating systems is what is now called the &quot;kernel&quot;. In technical and development circles the old restricted sense of an OS persists because of the continued active development of embedded operating systems for all kinds of devices with a data-processing component, from hand-held gadgets up to industrial robots and real-time control systems, which do not run user applications at the front end. An embedded OS in a device today is not so far removed as one might think from its ancestor of the 1950s.

The broader categories of systems and application software are discussed in the computer software article.

==Mainframes==
The first operating system used for real work was GM-NAA I/O, produced in 1956 by General Motors&#x27; Research division for its IBM 704. Most other early operating systems for IBM mainframes were also produced by customers.

Early operating systems were very diverse, with each vendor or customer producing one or more operating systems specific to their particular mainframe computer. Every operating system, even from the same vendor, could have radically different models of commands, operating procedures, and such facilities as debugging aids. Typically, each time the manufacturer brought out a new machine, there would be a new operating system, and most applications would have to be manually adjusted, recompiled, and retested.

===Systems on IBM hardware===
The state of affairs continued until the 1960s when IBM, already a leading hardware vendor, stopped work on existing systems and put all its effort into developing the System/360 series of machines, all of which used the &quot;same&quot; instruction and input/output architecture. IBM intended to develop a single operating system for the new hardware, the OS/360. The problems encountered in the development of the OS/360 are legendary, and are described by Fred Brooks in &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;—a book that has become a classic of software engineering. Because of performance differences across the hardware range and delays with software development, a whole family of operating systems was introduced instead of a single OS/360.

IBM wound up releasing a series of stop-gaps followed by two longer-lived operating systems:
* OS/360 for mid-range and large systems. This was available in three system generation options:
** PCP for early users and for those without the resources for multiprogramming.
** MFT for mid-range systems, replaced by MFT-II in OS/360 Release 15/16. This had one successor, OS/VS1, which was discontinued in the 1980s.
** MVT for large systems. This was similar in most ways to PCP and MFT (most programs could be ported among the three without being re-compiled), but has more sophisticated memory management and a time-sharing facility, TSO. MVT had several successors including the current z/OS.
* DOS/360 for small System/360 models had several successors including the current z/VSE. It was significantly different from OS/360.

IBM maintained full compatibility with the past, so that programs developed in the sixties can still run under z/VSE (if developed for DOS/360) or z/OS (if developed for MFT or MVT) with no change.

IBM also developed TSS/360, a time-sharing system for the System/360 Model 67. Overcompensating for their perceived importance of developing a timeshare system, they set hundreds of developers to work on the project. Early releases of TSS were slow and unreliable; by the time TSS had acceptable performance and reliability, IBM wanted its TSS users to migrate to OS/360 and OS/VS2; while IBM offered a TSS/370 PRPQ, they dropped it after 3 releases.

Several operating systems for the IBM S/360 and S/370 architectures were developed by third parties, including the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) and MUSIC/SP.

===Other mainframe operating systems===
Control Data Corporation developed the SCOPE operating systems in the 1960s, for batch processing and later developed the MACE operating system for time sharing, which was the basis for the later Kronos. In cooperation with the University of Minnesota, the Kronos and later the NOS operating systems were developed during the 1970s, which supported simultaneous batch and time sharing use. Like many commercial time sharing systems, its interface was an extension of the DTSS time sharing system, one of the pioneering efforts in timesharing and programming languages.

In the late 1970s, Control Data and the University of Illinois developed the PLATO system, which used plasma panel displays and long-distance time sharing networks. PLATO was remarkably innovative for its time; the shared memory model of PLATO&#x27;s TUTOR programming language allowed applications such as real-time chat and multi-user graphical games.

For the UNIVAC 1107, UNIVAC, the first commercial computer manufacturer, produced the EXEC I operating system, and Computer Sciences Corporation developed the EXEC II operating system and delivered it to UNIVAC. EXEC II was ported to the UNIVAC 1108. Later, UNIVAC developed the EXEC 8 operating system for the 1108; it was the basis for operating systems for later members of the family. Like all early mainframe systems, EXEC I and EXEC II were a batch-oriented system that managed magnetic drums, disks, card readers and line printers; EXEC 8 supported both batch processing and on-line transaction processing. In the 1970s, UNIVAC produced the Real-Time Basic (RTB) system to support large-scale time sharing, also patterned after the Dartmouth BASIC system.

Burroughs Corporation introduced the B5000 in 1961 with the MCP (Master Control Program) operating system. The B5000 was a stack machine designed to exclusively support high-level languages, with no software, not even at the lowest level of the operating system, being written directly in machine language or assembly language; the MCP was the first OS to be written entirely in a high-level language - ESPOL, a dialect of ALGOL 60 - although ESPOL had specialized statements for each &quot;syllable&quot; in the B5000 instruction set. MCP also introduced many other ground-breaking innovations, such as being one of the first commercial implementations of virtual memory. The rewrite of MCP for the B6500 is now marketed as the Unisys ClearPath/MCP.

GE introduced the GE-600 series with the General Electric Comprehensive Operating Supervisor (GECOS) operating system in 1962. After Honeywell acquired GE&#x27;s computer business, it was renamed to General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS). Honeywell expanded the use of the GCOS name to cover all its operating systems in the 1970s, though many of its computers had nothing in common with the earlier GE 600 series and their operating systems were not derived from the original GECOS.

Project MAC at MIT, working with GE and Bell Labs, developed Multics, which introduced the concept of ringed security privilege levels.

Digital Equipment Corporation developed TOPS-10 for its PDP-10 line of 36-bit computers in 1967. Before the widespread use of Unix, TOPS-10 was a particularly popular system in universities, and in the early ARPANET community. Bolt, Beranek, and Newman developed TENEX for a modified PDP-10 that supported demand paging; this was another popular system in the research and ARPANET communities, and was later developed by DEC into TOPS-20.

Scientific Data Systems/Xerox Data Systems developed several operating systems for the Sigma series of computers, such as the Basic Control Monitor (BCM), Batch Processing Monitor (BPM), and Basic Time-Sharing Monitor (BTM). Later, BPM and BTM were succeeded by the Universal Time-Sharing System (UTS); it was designed to provide multi-programming services for online (interactive) user programs in addition to batch-mode production jobs, It was succeeded by the CP-V operating system, which combined UTS with the heavily batch-oriented Xerox Operating System.

==Minicomputers==
Digital Equipment Corporation created several operating systems for its 16-bit PDP-11 machines, including the simple RT-11 system, the time-sharing RSTS operating systems, and the RSX-11 family of real-time operating systems, as well as the VMS system for the 32-bit VAX machines.

Several competitors of Digital Equipment Corporation such as Data General, Hewlett-Packard, and Computer Automation created their own operating systems. One such, &quot;MAX III&quot;, was developed for Modular Computer Systems Modcomp II and Modcomp III computers. It was characterised by its target market being the industrial control market. The Fortran libraries included one that enabled access to measurement and control devices.

IBM&#x27;s key innovation in operating systems in this class (which they call &quot;mid-range&quot;), was their &quot;CPF&quot; for the System/38. This had capability-based addressing, used a machine interface architecture to isolate the application software and most of the operating system from hardware dependencies (including even such details as address size and register size) and included an integrated RDBMS. The succeeding OS/400 (now known as IBM i) for the IBM AS/400 and later IBM Power Systems has no files, only objects of different types and these objects persist in very large, flat virtual memory, called a single-level store.
The Unix operating system was developed at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s, originally for the PDP-7, and later for the PDP-11. Because it was essentially free in early editions, easily obtainable, and easily modified, it achieved wide acceptance. It also became a requirement within the Bell systems operating companies. Since it was written in the C language, when that language was ported to a new machine architecture, Unix was also able to be ported. This portability permitted it to become the choice for a second generation of minicomputers and the first generation of workstations, and its use became widespread. Unix exemplified the idea of an operating system that was conceptually the same across various hardware platforms. Because of its utility, it inspired many and later became one of the roots of the free software movement and open-source software. Numerous operating systems were based upon it including Minix, GNU/Linux, and the Berkeley Software Distribution. Apple&#x27;s macOS is also based on Unix via NeXTSTEP and FreeBSD.

The Pick operating system was another operating system available on a wide variety of hardware brands. Commercially released in 1973 its core was a BASIC-like language called Data/BASIC and a SQL-style database manipulation language called ENGLISH. Licensed to a large variety of manufacturers and vendors, by the early 1980s observers saw the Pick operating system as a strong competitor to Unix.

==Microcomputers==
Beginning in the mid-1970s, a new class of small computers came onto the marketplace. Featuring 8-bit processors, typically the MOS Technology 6502, Intel 8080, Motorola 6800 or the Zilog Z80, along with rudimentary input and output interfaces and as much RAM as practical, these systems started out as kit-based hobbyist computers but soon evolved into an essential business tool.

===Home computers===
While many eight-bit home computers of the 1980s, such as the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum series and others could load a third-party disk-loading operating system, such as CP/M or GEOS, they were generally used without one. Their built-in operating systems were designed in an era when floppy disk drives were very expensive and not expected to be used by most users, so the standard storage device on most was a tape drive using standard compact cassettes. Most, if not all, of these computers shipped with a built-in BASIC interpreter on ROM, which also served as a crude command-line interface, allowing the user to load a separate disk operating system to perform file management commands and load and save to disk. The most popular home computer, the Commodore 64, was a notable exception, as its DOS was on ROM in the disk drive hardware, and the drive was addressed identically to printers, modems, and other external devices.

Furthermore, those systems shipped with minimal amounts of computer memory—4-8 kilobytes was standard on early home computers—as well as 8-bit processors without specialized support circuitry like an MMU or even a dedicated real-time clock. On this hardware, a complex operating system&#x27;s overhead supporting multiple tasks and users would likely compromise the performance of the machine without really being needed. As those systems were largely sold complete, with a fixed hardware configuration, there was also no need for an operating system to provide drivers for a wide range of hardware to abstract away differences.

Video games and even the available spreadsheet, database and word processors for home computers were mostly self-contained programs that took over the machine completely. Although integrated software existed for these computers, they usually lacked features compared to their standalone equivalents, largely due to memory limitations. Data exchange was mostly performed through standard formats like ASCII text or CSV, or through specialized file conversion programs.

===Operating systems in video games and consoles===
Since virtually all video game consoles and arcade cabinets designed and built after 1980 were true digital machines based on microprocessors (unlike the earlier &quot;Pong&quot; clones and derivatives), some of them carried a minimal form of BIOS or built-in game, such as the ColecoVision, the Sega Master System and the SNK Neo Geo.

Modern-day game consoles and videogames, starting with the PC-Engine, all have a minimal BIOS that also provides some interactive utilities such as memory card management, audio or video CD playback, copy protection and sometimes carry libraries for developers to use etc. Few of these cases, however, would qualify as a true operating system.

The most notable exceptions are probably the Dreamcast game console which includes a minimal BIOS, like the PlayStation, but can load the Windows CE operating system from the game disk allowing easily porting of games from the PC world, and the Xbox game console, which is little more than a disguised Intel-based PC running a secret, modified version of Microsoft Windows in the background. Furthermore, there are Linux versions that will run on a Dreamcast and later game consoles as well.

Long before that, Sony had released a kind of development kit called the Net Yaroze for its first PlayStation platform, which provided a series of programming and developing tools to be used with a normal PC and a specially modified &quot;Black PlayStation&quot; that could be interfaced with a PC and download programs from it. These operations require in general a functional OS on both platforms involved.

In general, it can be said that videogame consoles and arcade coin-operated machines used at most a built-in BIOS during the 1970s, 1980s and most of the 1990s, while from the PlayStation era and beyond they started getting more and more sophisticated, to the point of requiring a generic or custom-built OS for aiding in development and expandability.

===Personal computer era===

The development of microprocessors made inexpensive computing available for the small business and hobbyist, which in turn led to the widespread use of interchangeable hardware components using a common interconnection (such as the S-100, SS-50, Apple II, ISA, and PCI buses), and an increasing need for &quot;standard&quot; operating systems to control them. The most important of the early OSes on these machines was Digital Research&#x27;s CP/M-80 for the 8080 / 8085 / Z-80 CPUs. It was based on several Digital Equipment Corporation operating systems, mostly for the PDP-11 architecture. Microsoft&#x27;s first operating system, MDOS/MIDAS, was designed along many of the PDP-11 features, but for microprocessor based systems. MS-DOS, or PC DOS when supplied by IBM, was designed to be similar to CP/M-80. Each of these machines had a small boot program in ROM which loaded the OS itself from disk. The BIOS on the IBM-PC class machines was an extension of this idea and has accreted more features and functions in the 20 years since the first IBM-PC was introduced in 1981.

The decreasing cost of display equipment and processors made it practical to provide graphical user interfaces for many operating systems, such as the generic X Window System that is provided with many Unix systems, or other graphical systems such as Apple&#x27;s classic Mac OS and macOS, the Radio Shack Color Computer&#x27;s OS-9 Level II/Multi-Vue, Commodore&#x27;s AmigaOS, Atari TOS, IBM&#x27;s OS/2, and Microsoft Windows. The original GUI was developed on the Xerox Alto computer system at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1970s and commercialized by many vendors throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

Since the late 1990s, there have been three operating systems in widespread use on personal computers: Apple Inc.&#x27;s macOS, the open source Linux, and Microsoft Windows. Since 2005 and the Mac transition to Intel processors, all have been developed mainly on the x86 platform, although macOS retained PowerPC support until 2009 and Linux remains ported to a multitude of architectures including ones such as 68k, PA-RISC, and DEC Alpha, which have been long superseded and out of production, and SPARC and MIPS, which are used in servers or embedded systems but no longer for desktop computers. Other operating systems such as AmigaOS and OS/2 remain in use, if at all, mainly by retrocomputing enthusiasts or for specialized embedded applications.

===Mobile operating systems===


In the early 1990s, Psion released the Psion Series 3 PDA, a small mobile computing device. It supported user-written applications running on an operating system called EPOC. Later versions of EPOC became Symbian, an operating system used for mobile phones from Nokia, Ericsson, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, Samsung and phones developed for NTT Docomo by Sharp, Fujitsu &amp; Mitsubishi. Symbian was the world&#x27;s most widely used smartphone operating system until 2010 with a peak market share of 74% in 2006. In 1996, Palm Computing released the Pilot 1000 and Pilot 5000, running Palm OS. Microsoft Windows CE was the base for Pocket PC 2000, renamed Windows Mobile in 2003, which at its peak in 2007 was the most common operating system for smartphones in the U.S.

In 2007, Apple introduced the iPhone and its operating system, known as simply iPhone OS (until the release of iOS 4), which, like Mac OS X, is based on the Unix-like Darwin. In addition to these underpinnings, it also introduced a powerful and innovative graphic user interface that was later also used on the tablet computer iPad. A year later, Android, with its own graphical user interface, was introduced, based on a modified Linux kernel, and Microsoft re-entered the mobile operating system market with Windows Phone in 2010, which was replaced by Windows 10 Mobile in 2015.

In addition to these, a wide range of other mobile operating systems are contending in this area.

==Rise of virtualization==
Operating systems originally ran directly on the hardware itself and provided services to applications, but with virtualization, the operating system itself runs under the control of a hypervisor, instead of being in direct control of the hardware.

On mainframes IBM introduced the notion of a virtual machine in 1968 with CP/CMS on the IBM System/360 Model 67, and extended this later in 1972 with Virtual Machine Facility/370 (VM/370) on System/370.

On x86-based personal computers, VMware popularized this technology with their 1999 product, VMware Workstation, and their 2001 VMware GSX Server and VMware ESX Server products. Later, a wide range of products from others, including Xen, KVM and Hyper-V meant that by 2010 it was reported that more than 80 percent of enterprises had a virtualization program or project in place, and that 25 percent of all server workloads would be in a virtual machine.

Over time, the line between virtual machines, monitors, and operating systems was blurred:
* Hypervisors grew more complex, gaining their own application programming interface, memory management or file system.
* Virtualization becomes a key feature of operating systems, as exemplified by KVM and LXC in Linux, Hyper-V in Windows Server 2008 or HP Integrity Virtual Machines in HP-UX.
* In some systems, such as POWER5 and later POWER servers from IBM, the hypervisor is no longer optional.
* Radically simplified operating systems, such as CoreOS have been designed to run only on virtual systems.
* Applications have been re-designed to run directly on a virtual machine monitor.

In many ways, virtual machine software today plays the role formerly held by the operating system, including managing the hardware resources (processor, memory, I/O devices), applying scheduling policies, or allowing system administrators to manage the system.

<text>The Hadean ( ) is the first and oldest of the four known geologic eons of Earth&#x27;s history, starting with the planet&#x27;s formation about 4.6 billion years ago (estimated 4567.30 ± 0.16 million years ago set by the age of the oldest solid material in the Solar System — protoplanetary disk dust particles — found as chondrules and calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions in some meteorites about 4.567 billion years old), and ended 4.031 billion years ago. The interplanetary collision that created the Moon occurred early in this eon. The Hadean eon was succeeded by the Archean eon, with the Late Heavy Bombardment hypothesized to have occurred at the Hadean-Archean boundary.

Hadean rocks are very rare, largely consisting of granular zircons from one locality (Jack Hills) in Western Australia. Hadean geophysical models remain controversial among geologists: plate tectonics and the growth of cratons into continents may have started in the Hadean, but there is still uncertainty.

Earth in the early Hadean had a very thick hydride-rich atmosphere whose composition likely resembled the solar nebula and the gas giants, with mostly water vapor, methane and ammonia. As the Earth&#x27;s surface cooled, vaporized atmospheric water condensed into liquid water and eventually a superocean covering nearly all of the planet was formed, turning Earth into an ocean planet. Volcanic outgassing and asteroid bombardments further altered the Hadean atmosphere eventually into the nitrogen- and carbon dioxide-rich, weakly reducing Paleoarchean atmosphere.

==Etymology==
The eon&#x27;s name &quot;Hadean&quot; comes from Hades, the Greek god of the underworld (whose name is also used to describe the underworld itself), referring to the hellish conditions then prevailing on early Earth: the planet had just been formed from recent accretion, and its surface was still molten with superheated lava due to that, the abundance of short-lived radioactive elements, and frequent impact events with other Solar System bodies.

The term was coined by American geologist Preston Cloud, originally to label the period before the earliest known rocks on Earth. W.B. Harland later coined an almost synonymous term, the Priscoan period, from &quot;priscus&quot;, a Latin word for &#x27;ancient&#x27;. Other, older texts refer to the eon as the Pre-Archean.

==Rock dating==
Prior to the 1980s and the discovery of Hadean lithic fragments, scientific narratives of the early Earth explanations were almost entirely in the hands of geodynamic modelers.

In the last decades of the 20th century, geologists identified a few Hadean rocks from western Greenland, northwestern Canada, and Western Australia. In 2015, traces of carbon minerals interpreted as &quot;remains of biotic life&quot; were found in 4.1-billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.

The oldest dated zircon crystals, enclosed in a metamorphosed sandstone conglomerate in the Jack Hills of the Narryer Gneiss terrane of Western Australia, date to 4.404 ± 0.008 Ga. This zircon is a slight outlier, with the oldest consistently dated zircon falling closer to 4.35 Ga—around 200 million years after the hypothesized time of Earth&#x27;s formation.

In many other areas, xenocryst (or relict) Hadean zircons enclosed in older rocks indicate that younger rocks have formed on older terranes and have incorporated some of the older material. One example occurs in the Guiana shield from the Iwokrama Formation of southern Guyana where zircon cores have been dated at 4.22 Ga.

==Atmosphere==
A sizable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth. Water molecules would have escaped Earth&#x27;s gravity more easily when the planet was less massive during its formation. Photodissociation by short-wave ultraviolet in sunlight could split surface water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen, the former of which would readily react to form compounds in the then-reducing atmosphere, while the latter (along with the similarly light helium) would be expected to continually leave the atmosphere (as it does to the present day) due to atmospheric escape.

Part of the ancient planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the impact that created the Moon, which should have caused the melting of one or two large regions of Earth. Earth&#x27;s present composition suggests that there was not complete remelting as it is difficult to completely melt and mix huge rock masses. However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact. The material would have condensed within 2,000 years. The initial magma ocean solidified within 5 million years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy atmosphere with hydrogen and water vapor. The initial heavy atmosphere had a surface temperature of and an atmospheric pressure of above 27 standard atmospheres.

==Oceans==

Studies of zircons have found that liquid water may have existed between 4.0 and 4.4 billion years ago, very soon after the formation of Earth. Liquid water oceans existed despite the high surface temperature, because at an atmospheric pressure of 27 atmospheres, water remains liquid even at those high temperatures.

The most likely source of the water in the Hadean ocean was outgassing from the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Bombardment origin of a substantial amount of water is unlikely, due to the incompatibility of isotope fractions between the Earth and comets.

Asteroid impacts during the Hadean and into the Archean would have periodically disrupted the ocean. The geological record from 3.2 Gya contains evidence of multiple impacts of objects up to in diameter. Each such impact would have boiled off up to of a global ocean, and temporarily raised the atmospheric temperature to . However, the frequency of meteorite impacts is still under study: the Earth may have gone through long periods when liquid oceans and life were possible.

The liquid water would absorb the carbon dioxide in the early atmosphere; this would not be enough by itself to substantially reduce the amount of .

==Plate tectonics==

A 2008 study of zircons found that Australian Hadean rock contains minerals pointing to the existence of plate tectonics as early as 4 billion years ago (approximately 600 million years after Earth&#x27;s formation). However, some geologists suggest that the zircons could have been formed by meteorite impacts. The direct evidence of Hadean geology from zircons is limited, because the zircons are largely gathered in one locality in Australia. Geophysical models are underconstrained, but can paint a general picture of the state of Earth in the Hadean.

Mantle convection in the Hadean was likely vigorous, due to lower viscosity. The lower viscosity was due to the high levels of radiogenic heat and the fact that water in the mantle had not yet fully outgassed. Whether the vigorous convection led to plate tectonics in the Hadean or was confined under a rigid lid is still a matter of debate. The presence of Hadean oceans is thought to have triggered plate tectonics.

Subduction due to plate tectonics would have removed carbonate from the early oceans, contributing to the removal of the -rich early atmosphere. Removal of this early atmosphere is evidence of Hadean plate tectonics.

If plate tectonics occurred in the Hadean, it would have formed continental crust. Different models predict different amounts of continental crust during the Hadean. The work of Dhiume &quot;et al.&quot; predicts that by the end of the Hadean, the continental crust had only 25% of today&#x27;s area. The models of Korenaga, &quot;et al.&quot; predict that the continental crust grew to present-day volume sometime between 4.2 and 4.0 Gya.

==Continents==
The amount of exposed land in the Hadean is only loosely dependent on the amount of continental crust: it also depends on the ocean level. In models where plate tectonics started in the Archean, Earth has a global ocean in the Hadean. The high heat of the mantle may have made it difficult to support high elevations in the Hadean. If continents did form in the Hadean, their growth competed with outgassing of water from the mantle. Continents may have appeared in the mid-Hadean, and then disappeared under a thick ocean by the end of the Hadean. The limited amount of land has implications for the origin of life.

==Possible life==

Abundant Hadean-like geothermal microenvironments were shown by Salditt &quot;et al.&quot; to have the potential to support the synthesis and replication of RNA and thus possibly the evolution of a primitive life form. Porous rock systems comprising heated air-water interfaces were shown to allow ribozyme-catalyzed RNA replication of sense and antisense strands followed by subsequent strand dissociation, thus enabling combined synthesis, release and folding of active ribozymes. Such a primitive RNA system also may have been able to undergo template strand switching during replication (genetic recombination) as occurs during the RNA replication of extant coronaviruses.
A study published in 2024 inferred the last common ancestor of all current life to have emerged during the Hadean, between 4.09 and 4.33 Gya.

Although the early part of the Late Heavy Bombardment happened during the Hadean, the impacts were frequent only on a cosmic scale, with thousands or even millions of years between each event. As Earth already had oceans, life would have been possible, but vulnerable to extinction events caused by those impacts. The risk would not be on the frequency, but on the size of the impactor, and remains on the Moon suggest impactors bigger than the Chicxulub impactor that caused the extinction of dinosaurs. An impactor big enough may erase all life on the planet, although some models suggest that microscopic life may still survive it underground or in the oceanic depths.

<text>In the study of language, description or descriptive linguistics is the work of objectively analyzing and describing how language is actually used (or how it was used in the past) by a speech community. 

All academic research in linguistics is descriptive; like all other scientific disciplines, it seeks to describe reality, without the bias of preconceived ideas about how it ought to be. Modern descriptive linguistics is based on a structural approach to language, as exemplified in the work of Leonard Bloomfield and others. This type of linguistics utilizes different methods in order to describe a language such as basic data collection, and different types of elicitation methods.

==Descriptive versus prescriptive linguistics==
Linguistic description is often contrasted with linguistic prescription, which is found especially in education and in publishing.

As English-linguist Larry Andrews describes it, descriptive grammar is the linguistic approach which studies what a language is like, as opposed to prescriptive, which declares what a language should be like. In other words, descriptive grammarians focus analysis on how all kinds of people in all sorts of environments, usually in more casual, everyday settings, communicate, whereas prescriptive grammarians focus on the grammatical rules and structures predetermined by linguistic registers and figures of power. An example that Andrews uses in his book is &quot;fewer than&quot; vs &quot;less than&quot;. A descriptive grammarian would state that both statements are equally valid, as long as the meaning behind the statement can be understood. A prescriptive grammarian would analyze the rules and conventions behind both statements to determine which statement is correct or otherwise preferable. Andrews also believes that, although most linguists would be descriptive grammarians, most public school teachers tend to be prescriptive.

==History of the discipline==
The earliest known descriptive linguistic work took place in a Sanskrit community in northern India; the most well-known scholar of that linguistic tradition was Pāṇini, whose works are commonly dated to around the . Philological traditions later arose around the description of Greek, Latin, Chinese, Tamil, Hebrew, and Arabic. The description of modern European languages did not begin before the Renaissance – e.g. Spanish in 1492, French in 1532, English in 1586; the same period saw the first grammatical descriptions of Nahuatl (1547) or Quechua (1560) in the New World, followed by numerous others.

Even though more and more languages were discovered, the full diversity of language was not yet fully recognized. For centuries, language descriptions tended to use grammatical categories that existed for languages considered to be more prestigious, like Latin.

Linguistic description as a discipline really took off at the end of the 19th century, with the Structuralist revolution (from Ferdinand de Saussure to Leonard Bloomfield), and the notion that every language forms a unique symbolic system, different from other languages, worthy of being described “in its own terms”.

== Methods ==
The first critical step of language description is to collect data. To do this, a researcher does fieldwork in a speech community of their choice, and they record samples from different speakers. The data they collect often comes from different kind of speech genres that include narratives, daily conversations, poetry, songs and many others. While speech that comes naturally is preferred, researchers use elicitation, by asking speakers for translations, grammar rules, pronunciation, or by testing sentences using substitution frames. Substitution frames are pre-made sentences put together by the researcher that are like fill in the blanks. They do this with nouns and verbs to see how the structure of the sentence might change or how the noun and verb might change in structure.

There are different types of elicitation used in the fieldwork for linguistic description. These include schedule controlled elicitation, and analysis controlled elicitation, each with their own sub branches. Schedule controlled elicitation is when the researcher has a questionnaire of material to elicit to individuals and asks the questions in a certain order according to a schedule. These types of schedules and questionnaires usually focus on language families, and are typically flexible and are able to be changed if need be. The other type of elicitation is analysis controlled elicitation which is elicitation that is not under a schedule. The analysis of the language here in fact controls the elicitation. There are many sub types of analysis controlled elicitation, such as target language interrogation elicitation, stimulus driven elicitation, and many other types of elicitation. Target language interrogation elicitation is when the researcher asks individuals questions in the target language, and the researcher records all the different answers from all the individuals and compares them. Stimulus driven elicitation is when a researcher provides pictures, objects or video clips to the language speakers and asks them to describe the items presented to them. These types of elicitation help the researcher build a vocabulary, and basic grammatical structures.

This process is long and tedious and spans over several years. This long process ends with a corpus, which is a body of reference materials, that can be used to test hypothesis regarding the language in question.

==Challenges==
Almost all linguistic theory has its origin in practical problems of descriptive linguistics. Phonology (and its theoretical developments, such as the phoneme) deals with the function and interpretation of sound in language. Syntax has developed to describe how words relate to each other in order to form sentences. Lexicology collects words as well as their derivations and transformations: it has not given rise to much generalized theory.

Linguistics description might aim to achieve one or more of the following goals:

# A description of the phonology of the language in question.
# A description of the morphology of words belonging to that language.
# A description of the syntax of well-formed sentences of that language.
# A description of lexical derivation.
# A documentation of the vocabulary, including at least one thousand entries.
# A reproduction of a few genuine texts.

<text>Banded iron formations (BIFs; also called banded ironstone formations) are distinctive units of sedimentary rock consisting of alternating layers of iron oxides and iron-poor chert. They can be up to several hundred meters in thickness and extend laterally for several hundred kilometers. Almost all of these formations are of Precambrian age and are thought to record the oxygenation of the Earth&#x27;s oceans. Some of the Earth&#x27;s oldest rock formations, which formed about (Ma), are associated with banded iron formations.

Banded iron formations are thought to have formed in sea water as the result of oxygen production by photosynthetic cyanobacteria. The oxygen combined with dissolved iron in Earth&#x27;s oceans to form insoluble iron oxides, which precipitated out, forming a thin layer on the ocean floor. Each band is similar to a varve, resulting from cyclic variations in oxygen production.

Banded iron formations were first discovered in northern Michigan in 1844. Banded iron formations account for more than 60% of global iron reserves and provide most of the iron ore presently mined. Most formations can be found in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, and the United States.

==Description==

A typical banded iron formation consists of repeated, thin layers (a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness) of silver to black iron oxides, either magnetite (Fe3O4) or hematite (Fe2O3), alternating with bands of iron-poor chert, often red in color, of similar thickness. A single banded iron formation can be up to several hundred meters in thickness and extend laterally for several hundred kilometers.

Banded iron formation is more precisely defined as chemically precipitated sedimentary rock containing greater than 15% iron. However, most BIFs have a higher content of iron, typically around 30% by mass, so that roughly half the rock is iron oxides and the other half is silica. The iron in BIFs is divided roughly equally between the more oxidized ferric form, Fe(III), and the more reduced ferrous form, Fe(II), so that the ratio Fe(III)/Fe(II+III) typically varies from 0.3 to 0.6. This indicates a predominance of magnetite, in which the ratio is 0.67, over hematite, for which the ratio is 1. In addition to the iron oxides (hematite and magnetite), the iron sediment may contain the iron-rich carbonates siderite and ankerite, or the iron-rich silicates minnesotaite and greenalite. Most BIFs are chemically simple, containing little but iron oxides, silica, and minor carbonate, though some contain significant calcium and magnesium, up to 9% and 6.7% as oxides respectively.

When used in the singular, the term banded iron formation refers to the sedimentary lithology just described. The plural form, banded iron formations, is used informally to refer to stratigraphic units that consist primarily of banded iron formation.

A well-preserved banded iron formation typically consists of &quot;macrobands&quot; several meters thick that are separated by thin shale beds. The macrobands in turn are composed of characteristic alternating layers of chert and iron oxides, called &quot;mesobands&quot;, that are several millimeters to a few centimeters thick. Many of the chert mesobands contain &quot;microbands&quot; of iron oxides that are less than a millimeter thick, while the iron mesobands are relatively featureless. BIFs tend to be extremely hard, tough, and dense, making them highly resistant to erosion, and they show fine details of stratification over great distances, suggesting they were deposited in a very low-energy environment; that is, in relatively deep water, undisturbed by wave motion or currents. BIFs only rarely interfinger with other rock types, tending to form sharply bounded discrete units that never grade laterally into other rock types.
Banded iron formations of the Great Lakes region and the Frere Formation of western Australia are somewhat different in character and are sometimes described as &quot;granular iron formations&quot; or &quot;GIFs&quot;. Their iron sediments are granular to oolitic in character, forming discrete grains about a millimeter in diameter, and they lack microbanding in their chert mesobands. They also show more irregular mesobanding, with indications of ripples and other sedimentary structures, and their mesobands cannot be traced out any great distance. Though they form well-defined, discrete units, these are commonly interbedded with coarse to medium-grained epiclastic sediments (sediments formed by weathering of rock). These features suggest a higher energy depositional environment, in shallower water disturbed by wave motions. However, they otherwise resemble other banded iron formations.
The great majority of banded iron formations are Archean or Paleoproterozoic in age. However, a small number of BIFs are Neoproterozoic in age, and are frequently, if not universally, associated with glacial deposits, often containing glacial dropstones. They also tend to show a higher level of oxidation, with hematite prevailing over magnetite, and they typically contain a small amount of phosphate, about 1% by mass. Mesobanding is often poor to nonexistent and soft-sediment deformation structures are common. This suggests very rapid deposition. However, like the granular iron formations of the Great Lakes, the Neoproterozoic occurrences are widely described as banded iron formations.

Banded iron formations are distinct from most Phanerozoic ironstones. Ironstones are relatively rare and are thought to have been deposited in marine anoxic events, in which the depositional basin became depleted in free oxygen. They are composed of iron silicates and oxides without appreciable chert but with significant phosphorus content, which is lacking in BIFs.

No classification scheme for banded iron formations has gained complete acceptance. In 1954, Harold Lloyd James advocated a classification based on four lithological facies (oxide, carbonate, silicate, and sulfide) assumed to represent different depths of deposition, but this speculative model did not hold up. In 1980, Gordon A. Gross advocated a twofold division of BIFs into an Algoma type and a Lake Superior type, based on the character of the depositional basin. Algoma BIFs are found in relatively small basins in association with greywackes and other volcanic rocks and are assumed to be associated with volcanic centers. Lake Superior BIFs are found in larger basins in association with black shales, quartzites, and dolomites, with relatively minor tuffs or other volcanic rocks, and are assumed to have formed on a continental shelf. This classification has been more widely accepted, but the failure to appreciate that it is strictly based on the characteristics of the depositional basin and not the lithology of the BIF itself has led to confusion, and some geologists have advocated for its abandonment. However, the classification into Algoma versus Lake Superior types continues to be used.

==Occurrence==
Banded iron formations are almost exclusively Precambrian in age, with most deposits dating to the late Archean (2800–2500 Ma) with a secondary peak of deposition in the Orosirian period of the Paleoproterozoic (1850 Ma). Minor amounts were deposited in the early Archean and in the Neoproterozoic (750 Ma). The youngest known banded iron formation is an Early Cambrian formation in western China. Because the processes by which BIFs are formed appear to be restricted to early geologic time, and may reflect unique conditions of the Precambrian world, they have been intensively studied by geologists.

Banded iron formations are found worldwide, in every continental shield of every continent. The oldest BIFs are associated with greenstone belts and include the BIFs of the Isua Greenstone Belt, the oldest known, which have an estimated age of 3700 to 3800 Ma. The Temagami banded iron deposits formed over a 50-million-year period, from 2736 to 2687 Ma, and reached a thickness of . Other examples of early Archean BIFs are found in the Abitibi greenstone belts, the greenstone belts of the Yilgarn and Pilbara cratons, the Baltic shield, and the cratons of the Amazon, north China, and south and west Africa.

The most extensive banded iron formations belong to what A.F. Trendall calls the Great Gondwana BIFs. These are late Archean in age and are not associated with greenstone belts. They are relatively undeformed and form extensive topographic plateaus, such as the Hamersley Range. The banded iron formations here were deposited from 2470 to 2450 Ma and are the thickest and most extensive in the world, with a maximum thickness in excess of . Similar BIFs are found in the Carajás Formation of the Amazon craton, the Cauê Itabirite of the São Francisco craton, the Kuruman Iron Formation and Penge Iron Formation of South Africa, and the Mulaingiri Formation of India.

Paleoproterozoic banded iron formations are found in the Iron Range and other parts of the Canadian Shield. The Iron Range is a group of four major deposits: the Mesabi Range, the Vermilion Range, the Gunflint Range, and the Cuyuna Range. All are part of the Animikie Group and were deposited between 2500 and 1800 Ma. These BIFs are predominantly granular iron formations.

Neoproterozoic banded iron formations include the Urucum in Brazil, Rapitan in the Yukon, and the Damara Belt in southern Africa. They are relatively limited in size, with horizontal extents not more than a few tens of kilometers and thicknesses not more than about . These are widely thought to have been deposited under unusual anoxic oceanic conditions associated with the &quot;Snowball Earth.&quot;

==Origins==

Banded iron formation provided some of the first evidence for the timing of the Great Oxidation Event, 2,400 Ma. With his 1968 paper on the early atmosphere and oceans of the Earth, Preston Cloud established the general framework that has been widely, if not universally, accepted for understanding the deposition of BIFs.

Cloud postulated that banded iron formations were a consequence of anoxic, iron-rich waters from the deep ocean welling up into a photic zone inhabited by cyanobacteria that had evolved the capacity to carry out oxygen-producing photosynthesis, but which had not yet evolved enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase) for living in an oxygenated environment. Such organisms would have been protected from their own oxygen waste through its rapid removal via the reservoir of reduced ferrous iron, Fe(II), in the early ocean. The oxygen released by photosynthesis oxidized the Fe(II) to ferric iron, Fe(III), which precipitated out of the sea water as insoluble iron oxides that settled to the ocean floor.

Cloud suggested that banding resulted from fluctuations in the population of cyanobacteria due to free radical damage by oxygen. This also explained the relatively limited extent of early Archean deposits. The great peak in BIF deposition at the end of the Archean was thought to be the result of the evolution of mechanisms for living with oxygen. This ended self-poisoning and produced a population explosion in the cyanobacteria that rapidly depleted the remaining supply of reduced iron and ended most BIF deposition. Oxygen then began to accumulate in the atmosphere.

Some details of Cloud&#x27;s original model were abandoned. For example, improved dating of Precambrian strata has shown that the late Archean peak of BIF deposition was spread out over tens of millions of years, rather than taking place in a very short interval of time following the evolution of oxygen-coping mechanisms. However, his general concepts continue to shape thinking about the origins of banded iron formations. In particular, the concept of the upwelling of deep ocean water, rich in reduced iron, into an oxygenated surface layer poor in iron remains a key element of most theories of deposition.

The few formations deposited after 1,800 Ma may point to intermittent low levels of free atmospheric oxygen, while the small peak at may be associated with the hypothetical Snowball Earth.

===Formation processes===

The microbands within chert layers are most likely varves produced by annual variations in oxygen production. Diurnal microbanding would require a very high rate of deposition of 2 meters per year or 5 km/Ma. Estimates of deposition rate based on various models of deposition and sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) estimates of the age of associated tuff beds suggest a deposition rate in typical BIFs of 19 to 270 m/Ma, which are consistent either with annual varves or rhythmites produced by tidal cycles.

Preston Cloud proposed that mesobanding was a result of self-poisoning by early cyanobacteria as the supply of reduced iron was periodically depleted. Mesobanding has also been interpreted as a secondary structure, not present in the sediments as originally laid down, but produced during compaction of the sediments. Another theory is that mesobands are primary structures resulting from pulses of activity along mid-ocean ridges that change the availability of reduced iron on time scales of decades. In the case of granular iron formations, the mesobands are attributed to winnowing of sediments in shallow water, in which wave action tended to segregate particles of different size and composition.

For banded iron formations to be deposited, several preconditions must be met.

# The deposition basin must contain waters that are ferruginous (rich in iron).
# This implies they are also anoxic, since ferrous iron oxidizes to ferric iron within hours or days in the presence of dissolved oxygen. This would prevent transport of large quantities of iron from its sources to the deposition basin. 
# The waters must not be euxinic (rich in hydrogen sulfide), since this would cause the ferrous iron to precipitate out as pyrite.
# There must be an oxidation mechanism active within the depositional basin that steadily converts the reservoir of ferrous iron to ferric iron.

====Source of reduced iron====

There must be an ample source of reduced iron that can circulate freely into the deposition basin. Plausible sources of iron include hydrothermal vents along mid-ocean ridges, windblown dust, rivers, glacial ice, and seepage from continental margins.

The importance of various sources of reduced iron has likely changed dramatically across geologic time. This is reflected in the division of BIFs into Algoma and Lake Superior-type deposits. Algoma-type BIFs formed primarily in the Archean. These older BIFs tend to show a positive europium anomaly consistent with a hydrothermal source of iron. By contrast, Lake Superior-type banded iron formations primarily formed during the Paleoproterozoic era, and lack the europium anomalies of the older Algoma-type BIFs, suggesting a much greater input of iron weathered from continents.

====Absence of oxygen or hydrogen sulfide====
The absence of hydrogen sulfide in anoxic ocean water can be explained either by reduced sulfur flux into the deep ocean or a lack of dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR), the process by which microorganisms use sulfate in place of oxygen for respiration. The product of DSR is hydrogen sulfide, which readily precipitates iron out of solution as pyrite.

The requirement of an anoxic, but not euxinic, deep ocean for deposition of banded iron formation suggests two models to explain the end of BIF deposition 1.8 billion years ago. The &quot;Holland ocean&quot; model proposes that the deep ocean became sufficiently oxygenated at that time to end transport of reduced iron. Heinrich Holland argues that the absence of manganese deposits during the pause between Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic BIFs is evidence that the deep ocean had become at least slightly oxygenated. The &quot;Canfield ocean&quot; model proposes that, to the contrary, the deep ocean became euxinic and transport of reduced iron was blocked by precipitation as pyrite.

Banded iron formations in northern Minnesota are overlain by a thick layer of ejecta from the Sudbury Basin impact. An asteroid (estimated at across) impacted into waters about deep 1.849 billion years ago, coincident with the pause in BIF deposition. Computer models suggest that the impact would have generated a tsunami at least high at the point of impact, and high about away. It has been suggested that the immense waves and large underwater landslides triggered by the impact caused the mixing of a previously stratified ocean, oxygenated the deep ocean, and ended BIF deposition shortly after the impact.

====Oxidation====
Although Cloud argued that microbial activity was a key process in the deposition of banded iron formation, the role of oxygenic versus anoxygenic photosynthesis continues to be debated, and nonbiogenic processes have also been proposed.

=====Oxygenic photosynthesis=====

Cloud&#x27;s original hypothesis was that ferrous iron was oxidized in a straightforward manner by molecular oxygen present in the water:

The oxygen comes from the photosynthetic activities of cyanobacteria. Oxidation of ferrous iron may have been hastened by aerobic iron-oxidizing bacteria, which can increase rates of oxidation by a factor of 50 under conditions of low oxygen.

=====Anoxygenic photosynthesis=====
Oxygenic photosynthesis is not the only biogenic mechanism for deposition of banded iron formations. Some geochemists have suggested that banded iron formations could form by direct oxidation of iron by microbial anoxygenic phototrophs. The concentrations of phosphorus and trace metals in BIFs are consistent with precipitation through the activities of iron-oxidizing bacteria.

Iron isotope ratios in the oldest banded iron formations (3700-3800 Ma), at Isua, Greenland, are best explained by assuming extremely low oxygen levels (&lt;0.001% of modern O2 levels in the photic zone) and anoxygenic photosynthetic oxidation of Fe(II):

This requires that dissimilatory iron reduction, the biological process in which microorganisms substitute Fe(III) for oxygen in respiration, was not yet widespread. By contrast, Lake Superior-type banded iron formations show iron isotope ratios that suggest that dissimilatory iron reduction expanded greatly during this period.

An alternate route is oxidation by anaerobic denitrifying bacteria. This requires that nitrogen fixation by microorganisms is also active.

=====Abiogenic mechanisms=====
The lack of organic carbon in banded iron formation argues against microbial control of BIF deposition. On the other hand, there is fossil evidence for abundant photosynthesizing cyanobacteria at the start of BIF deposition and of hydrocarbon markers in shales within banded iron formation of the Pilbara craton. The carbon that is present in banded iron formations is enriched in the light isotope, 12C, an indicator of a biological origin. If a substantial part of the original iron oxides was in the form of hematite, then any carbon in the sediments might have been oxidized by the decarbonization reaction:

Trendall and J.G. Blockley proposed, but later rejected, the hypothesis that banded iron formation might be a peculiar kind of Precambrian evaporite. Other proposed abiogenic processes include radiolysis by the radioactive isotope of potassium, 40K, or annual turnover of basin water combined with upwelling of iron-rich water in a stratified ocean.

Another abiogenic mechanism is photooxidation of iron by sunlight. Laboratory experiments suggest that this could produce a sufficiently high deposition rate under likely conditions of pH and sunlight. However, if the iron came from a shallow hydrothermal source, other laboratory experiments suggest that precipitation of ferrous iron as carbonates or silicates could seriously compete with photooxidation.

====Diagenesis====
Regardless of the precise mechanism of oxidation, the oxidation of ferrous to ferric iron likely caused the iron to precipitate out as a ferric hydroxide gel. Similarly, the silica component of the banded iron formations likely precipitated as a hydrous silica gel. The conversion of iron hydroxide and silica gels to banded iron formation is an example of diagenesis, the conversion of sediments into solid rock.

There is evidence that banded iron formations formed from sediments with nearly the same chemical composition as is found in the BIFs today. The BIFs of the Hamersley Range show great chemical homogeneity and lateral uniformity, with no indication of any precursor rock that might have been altered to the current composition. This suggests that, other than dehydration and decarbonization of the original ferric hydroxide and silica gels, diagenesis likely left the composition unaltered and consisted of crystallization of the original gels. Decarbonization may account for the lack of carbon and preponderance of magnetite in older banded iron formations. The relatively high content of hematite in Neoproterozoic BIFs suggests they were deposited very quickly and via a process that did not produce great quantities of biomass, so that little carbon was present to reduce hematite to magnetite.

However, it is possible that BIF was altered from carbonate rock or from hydrothermal mud during late stages of diagenesis. A 2018 study found no evidence that magnetite in BIF formed by decarbonization, and suggests that it formed from thermal decomposition of siderite via the reaction
The iron may have originally precipitated as greenalite and other iron silicates. Macrobanding is then interpreted as a product of compaction of the original iron silicate mud. This produced siderite-rich bands that served as pathways for fluid flow and formation of magnetite.

===The Great Oxidation Event===
The peak of deposition of banded iron formations in the late Archean, and the end of deposition in the Orosirian, have been interpreted as markers for the Great Oxygenation Event. Prior to 2.45 billion years ago, the high degree of mass-independent fractionation of sulfur (MIF-S) indicates an extremely oxygen-poor atmosphere. The peak of banded iron formation deposition coincides with the disappearance of the MIF-S signal, which is interpreted as the permanent appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere between 2.41 and 2.35 billion years ago. This was accompanied by the development of a stratified ocean with a deep anoxic layer and a shallow oxidized layer. The end of deposition of BIF at 1.85 billion years ago is attributed to the oxidation of the deep ocean.

===Snowball Earth hypothesis===
Until 1992 it was assumed that the rare, later (younger) banded iron deposits represented unusual conditions where oxygen was depleted locally. Iron-rich waters would then form in isolation and subsequently come into contact with oxygenated water. The Snowball Earth hypothesis provided an alternative explanation for these younger deposits. In a Snowball Earth state the continents, and possibly seas at low latitudes, were subject to a severe ice age circa 750 to 580 Ma that nearly or totally depleted free oxygen. Dissolved iron then accumulated in the oxygen-poor oceans (possibly from seafloor hydrothermal vents). Following the thawing of the Earth, the seas became oxygenated once more causing the precipitation of the iron. Banded iron formations of this period are predominantly associated with the Sturtian glaciation.

An alternative mechanism for banded iron formations in the Snowball Earth era suggests the iron was deposited from metal-rich brines in the vicinity of hydrothermally active rift zones due to glacially-driven thermal overturn. The limited extent of these BIFs compared with the associated glacial deposits, their association with volcanic formations, and variation in thickness and facies favor this hypothesis. Such a mode of formation does not require a global anoxic ocean, but is consistent with either a Snowball Earth or Slushball Earth model.

==Economic geology==

Banded iron formations provide most of the iron ore presently mined. More than 60% of global iron reserves are in the form of banded iron formation, most of which can be found in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, and the United States.

Different mining districts coined their own names for BIFs. The term &quot;banded iron formation&quot; was coined in the iron districts of Lake Superior, where the ore deposits of the Mesabi, Marquette, Cuyuna, Gogebic, and Menominee iron ranges were also variously known as &quot;jasper&quot;, &quot;jaspilite&quot;, &quot;iron-bearing formation&quot;, or taconite. Banded iron formations were described as &quot;itabarite&quot; in Brazil, as &quot;ironstone&quot; in South Africa, and as &quot;BHQ&quot; (banded hematite quartzite) in India.

Banded iron formation was first discovered in northern Michigan in 1844, and mining of these deposits prompted the earliest studies of BIFs, such as those of Charles R. Van Hise and Charles Kenneth Leith. Iron mining operations on the Mesabi and Cuyuna Ranges evolved into enormous open pit mines, where steam shovels and other industrial machines could remove massive amounts of ore. Initially the mines exploited large beds of hematite and goethite weathered out of the banded iron formations, and some of this &quot;natural ore&quot; had been extracted by 1980. By 1956, large-scale commercial production from the BIF itself began at the Peter Mitchell Mine near Babbitt, Minnesota. Production in Minnesota was of ore concentrate per year in 2016, which is about 75% of total U.S. production. Magnetite-rich banded iron formation, known locally as taconite, is ground to a powder, and the magnetite is separated with powerful magnets and pelletized for shipment and smelting.
Iron ore became a global commodity after the Second World War, and with the end of the embargo against exporting iron ore from Australia in 1960, the Hamersley Range became a major mining district. The banded iron formations here are the thickest and most extensive in the world, originally covering an area of and containing about of iron. The range contains 80 percent of all identified iron ore reserves in Australia. Over of iron ore is removed from the range every year.

The Itabarite banded iron formations of Brazil cover at least and are up to thick. These form the Quadrilatero Ferrifero or Iron Quadrangle, which resembles the Iron Range mines of United States in that the favored ore is hematite weathered out of the BIFs. Production from the Iron Quadrangle helps make Brazil the second largest producer of iron ore after Australia, with monthly exports averaging from December 2007 to May 2018.
Mining of ore from banded iron formations at Anshan in north China began in 1918. When Japan occupied Northeast China in 1931, these mills were turned into a Japanese-owned monopoly, and the city became a significant strategic industrial hub during the Second World War. Total production of processed iron in Manchuria reached in 1931–1932. By 1942, Anshan&#x27;s Shōwa Steel Works total production capacity reached per annum, making it one of the major iron and steel centers in the world. Production was severely disrupted during the Soviet occupation of Manchuria in 1945 and the subsequent Chinese Civil War. However, from 1948 to 2001, the steel works produced 290 million tons of steel, of pig iron and of rolled steel. Annual production capacity is of pig iron, of steel and of rolled steel. A quarter of China&#x27;s total iron ore reserves, about , are located in Anshan.

<doc id="55407" wikidata="Q464091" url="?curid=55407" title="Silenus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Silenus (; , ) was a companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus. He is typically older than the satyrs of the Dionysian retinue (&quot;thiasos&quot;), and sometimes considerably older, in which case he may be referred to as a Papposilenus. &quot;Silen&quot; and its plural &quot;sileni&quot; refer to the mythological figure as a type that is sometimes thought to be differentiated from a satyr by having the attributes of a horse rather than a goat, though usage of the two words is not consistent enough to permit a sharp distinction.

Silenus presides over other daimons and is related to musical creativity, prophetic ecstasy, drunken joy, drunken dances and gestures.

In the decorative arts, a &quot;silene&quot; is a Silenus-like figure, often a &quot;mask&quot; (face) alone.

==Evolution==
The original Silenus resembled a folkloric man of the forest, with the ears of a horse and sometimes also the tail and legs of a horse. The later sileni were drunken followers of Dionysus, usually bald and fat with thick lips and squat noses, and having the legs of a human. Later still, the plural &quot;sileni&quot; went out of use and the only references were to one individual named Silenus, the teacher and faithful companion of the wine-god Dionysus.

A notorious consumer of wine, he was usually drunk and had to be supported by satyrs or carried by a donkey. Silenus was described as the oldest, wisest and most drunken of the followers of Dionysus, and was said in Orphic hymns to be the young god&#x27;s tutor. This puts him in a company of phallic or half-animal tutors of the gods, a group that includes Priapus, Hermaphroditus, Cedalion and Chiron, but also includes Pallas, the tutor of Athena.

When intoxicated, Silenus was said to possess special knowledge and the power of prophecy. The Phrygian King Midas was eager to learn from Silenus and caught the old man by lacing with wine a fountain from which Silenus often drank. As Silenus fell asleep, the king&#x27;s servants seized and took him to their master. An alternative story was that when lost and wandering in Phrygia, Silenus was rescued by peasants and taken to Midas, who treated him kindly. In return for Midas&#x27; hospitality Silenus told him some tales and the king, enchanted by Silenus&#x27; fictions, entertained him for five days and nights. Dionysus offered Midas a reward for his kindness toward Silenus, and Midas chose the power of turning everything he touched into gold. Another story was that Silenus had been captured by two shepherds, and regaled them with wondrous tales.

In Euripides&#x27;s satyr play &quot;Cyclops&quot;, Silenus is stranded with the satyrs in Sicily, where they have been enslaved by the Cyclopes. They are the comic elements of the story, a parody of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; IX. Silenus refers to the satyrs as his children during the play.

Silenus may have become a Latin term of abuse around 211 BC, when it is used in Plautus&#x27; &quot;Rudens&quot; to describe Labrax, a treacherous pimp or &quot;leno&quot;, as &quot;...a pot-bellied old Silenus, bald head, beefy, bushy eyebrows, scowling, twister, god-forsaken criminal&quot;. In his satire &quot;The Caesars&quot;, the emperor Julian has Silenus sitting next to the gods to offer up his comments on the various rulers under examination, including Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Augustus, Marcus Aurelius (whom he reveres as a fellow philosopher-king), and Constantine I.

Silenus commonly figures in Roman bas-reliefs of the train of Dionysus, a subject for sarcophagi, embodying the transcendent promises of Dionysian cult.

In Book VI of Pausanias&#x27; Description of Greece, his grave is said to be &quot;in the land of the Hebrews&quot;.

===Papposilenus===
Papposilenus is a representation of Silenus that emphasizes his old age, particularly as a stock character in satyr play or comedy. In vase painting, his hair is often white, and as in statuettes, Papposilenus has a , flabby breasts and shaggy thighs. In these depictions, it is often clear that the Papposilenus is an actor playing a part. His costuming includes a body stocking tufted with hair (&quot;mallōtos chitōn&quot;) that seems to have come into use in the mid-5th century BC.

==Wisdom==
A theme in Greek philosophy and literature is the wisdom of Silenus, which posits an antinatalist philosophy:

You, most blessed and happiest among humans, may well consider those blessed and happiest who have departed this life before you, and thus you may consider it unlawful, indeed blasphemous, to speak anything ill or false of them, since they now have been transformed into a better and more refined nature. This thought is indeed so old that the one who first uttered it is no longer known; it has been passed down to us from eternity, and hence doubtless it is true. Moreover, you know what is so often said and passes for a trite expression. What is that, he asked? He answered: It is best not to be born at all; and next to that, it is better to die than to live; and this is confirmed even by divine testimony. Pertinently to this they say that Midas, after hunting, asked his captive Silenus somewhat urgently, what was the most desirable thing among humankind. At first he could offer no response, and was obstinately silent. At length, when Midas would not stop plaguing him, he erupted with these words, though very unwillingly: &#x27;you, seed of an evil genius and precarious offspring of hard fortune, whose life is but for a day, why do you compel me to tell you those things of which it is better you should remain ignorant? For he lives with the least worry who knows not his misfortune; but for humans, the best for them is not to be born at all, not to partake of nature&#x27;s excellence; not to be is best, for both sexes. This should be our choice, if choice we have; and the next to this is, when we are born, to die as soon as we can.&#x27; It is plain therefore, that he declared the condition of the dead to be better than that of the living.
: – Aristotle, &quot;Eudemus&quot; (354 BCE), surviving fragment quoted in Plutarch, &quot;Moralia. Consolatio ad Apollonium&quot;, sec. xxvii (1st century CE) (S. H. transl.)

This passage is redolent of Theognis&#x27; &quot;Elegies&quot; (425–428). Silenus&#x27; wisdom appears in the writings of Arthur Schopenhauer, who endorsed this famous dictum. Via Schopenhauer, Nietzsche discusses the &quot;wisdom of Silenus&quot; in &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;.

Both Socrates and Aesop were sometimes described as having a physical appearance like that of Silenus, with broad flat faces and fat bellies.

==Classical tradition==
===In art===
In the Renaissance, a court dwarf posed for the Silenus-like figure astride a tortoise at the entrance to the Boboli Gardens, Florence. Rubens painted &quot;The Drunken Silenus&quot; (1616–17), now conserved in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich – the subject was also treated by van Dyck and Ribera.

During the late 19th century in Germany and Vienna, symbolism from ancient Greece was reinterpreted through a new Freudian prism. Around the same time, Vienna Secession artist Gustav Klimt uses the irreverent, chubby-faced Silenus as a motif in several works to represent &quot;buried instinctual forces&quot;.

===In literature===
In &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, Rabelais referred to Silenus as the foster father of Bacchus. In 1884 Thomas Woolner published a long narrative poem about Silenus. In Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1890 novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, Lord Henry Wooton turns praise of folly into a philosophy which mocks &quot;slow Silenus&quot; for being sober. In Brian Hooker&#x27;s 1923 English translation of Edmond Rostand&#x27;s &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, Cyrano disparagingly refers to the ham actor Montfleury as &quot;That Silenus who cannot hold his belly in his arms.&quot;

Professor Silenus is a character in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Decline and Fall&quot;. He features as the disaffected architect of King&#x27;s Thursday and provides the novel with one of its primary motifs. In the prophetic style of the traditional Greek Silenus he informs the protagonist that life is

a great disc of polished wood that revolves quickly. At first you sit down and watch the others. They are all trying to sit in the wheel, and they keep getting flung off, and that makes them laugh, and you laugh too. It&#x27;s great fun... Of course at the very centre there&#x27;s a point completely at rest, if one could only find it... Lots of people just enjoy scrambling on and being whisked off and scrambling on again... But the whole point about the wheel is that you needn&#x27;t get on it at all... People get hold of ideas about life, and that makes them think they&#x27;ve got to join in the game, even if they don&#x27;t enjoy it. It doesn&#x27;t suit everyone...

Silenus is one of the two main characters in Tony Harrison&#x27;s 1990 satyr play &quot;The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus&quot;, partly based on Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Ichneutae&quot; (5th century BC).

==Scientific nomenclature==
Carl Linnaeus used the feminine form &quot;Silene&quot; as the name of a genus of flowering plant.

<doc id="55412" wikidata="Q331380" url="?curid=55412" title="Schenectady, New York">
<text>Schenectady ( ) is a city in Schenectady County, New York, United States, of which it is the county seat. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population of 67,047 made it the state&#x27;s ninth-most populous city and the twenty-fifth most-populous municipality. The city is in eastern New York, near the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers. It is in the same metropolitan area as the state capital, Albany, which is about southeast.

Schenectady was founded on the south side of the Mohawk River by Dutch colonists in the 17th century, many of whom came from the Albany area. The name &quot;Schenectady&quot; is derived from the Mohawk word &quot;skahnéhtati&quot;, meaning &quot;beyond the pines&quot; and used for the area around Albany, New York. Residents of the new village developed farms on strip plots along the river. Connected to the west by the Mohawk River and Erie Canal, Schenectady developed rapidly in the 19th century as part of the Mohawk Valley trade, manufacturing, and transportation corridor. By 1824, more people worked in manufacturing than agriculture or trade; like many New York cities, it had a cotton mill that processed cotton from the Deep South. In the 19th century, nationally influential companies and industries developed in Schenectady, including General Electric and American Locomotive Company (ALCO), which were powers into the mid-20th century. Schenectady was part of emerging technologies, with GE collaborating in the production of nuclear-powered submarines and, in the 21st century, working on other forms of renewable energy.

==History==
When first encountered by Europeans, the Mohawk Valley was the territory of the Mohawk nation, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, or &quot;Haudenosaunee.&quot; They had occupied territory in the region since at least 1100 AD. Starting in the early 1600s the Mohawk moved their settlements closer to the river and by 1629, they had also taken over territories on the Hudson River&#x27;s west bank that were formerly held by the Algonquian-speaking Mahican people.
In the 1640s, the Mohawk had three major villages, all on the Mohawk River&#x27;s south side. The easternmost one was Ossernenon, about 9 miles west of present-day Auriesville, New York. When Dutch settlers developed Fort Orange (present-day Albany, New York) in the Hudson Valley beginning in 1614, the Mohawk called their settlement &quot;skahnéhtati,&quot;, also transiliterated to ‘’Sche-negh-ta-da”, meaning &quot;beyond the pines&quot;, referring to a large area of pine barrens between the Mohawk settlements and the Hudson River. About 3,200 acres of this unique ecosystem are now protected as the Albany Pine Bush. Eventually, this word entered the lexicon of the Dutch settlers. The settlers in Fort Orange used &quot;skahnéhtati&quot; to refer to the new village at the Mohawk flats (see below), which became known as Schenectady (with a variety of spellings).

In 1661, Arendt van Corlaer, (later Van Curler), a Dutch immigrant, bought a large piece of land on the Mohawk River&#x27;s south side. The Colonial government gave other colonists grants of land in this portion of the flat fertile river valley, as part of New Netherland. The settlers recognized the Mohawk had cultivated these bottomlands for maize for centuries. Van Curler took the largest piece of land; the remainder was divided into 50-acre plots for the other first fourteen proprietors; Alexander Lindsey Glen, Philip Hendrickse Brouwer, Simon Volkertse Veeder, Pieter Adrianne Van Wogglelum, Teunize Cornelise Swart, Bastia De Winter atty for Catalyn De Vos, Gerrit Bancker, William Teller, Pieter Jacobse Borsboom, Pieter Danielle Van Olinda, Jan Barentse Wemp(le), Jacques Cornelize Van Slyck, Marten Cornelize Van Esselstyn, and Harmen Albertse Vedder. As most early colonists were from the Fort Orange area, they may have anticipated working as fur traders, but the Beverwijck (later Albany) traders kept a monopoly of legal control. The settlers here turned to farming. Their 50-acre lots were unique for the colony, &quot;laid out in strips along the Mohawk River&quot;, with the narrow edges fronting the river, as in French colonial style. They relied on rearing livestock and wheat. The proprietors and their descendants controlled all the land of the town for generations, essentially acting as government until after the Revolutionary War, when representative government was established.

Beginning from the first decades of European colonization, Dutch colonists formed relationships with Mohawk women, though these did not usually result in marriage. Their children were raised within Mohawk communities, as the tribe had a matrilineal kinship system, and these multiracial offspring were considered to be born into the mother&#x27;s clan. During the colonial era, the fur trade formed one of the important trading relationships between Indians and colonists. In response to labor shortages among Dutch colonists, enslaved Africans were imported to work on farmsteads in Schenectady.

Some Euro-Indian descendants, such as Jacques Cornelissen Van Slyck and his sister Hilletie van Olinda, who were of Dutch, French and Mohawk ancestry, became interpreters and intermarried with Dutch colonists. They also gained land in the Schenectady settlement. They were among the few &quot;métis&quot; who seemed to move from Mohawk to Dutch society, as they were described as &quot;former Indians&quot;, although they did not always have an easy time of it. In 1661 Jacques inherited what became known as Van Slyck&#x27;s Island from his brother Marten, who had been given it by the Mohawk. Van Slyck family descendants retained ownership through the 19th century.

In 1664, an English fleet conquered the colony of New Netherland and renamed it New York. They confirmed the monopoly on the fur trade by Albany, and issued orders to prohibit Schenectady from the trade through 1670 and later. Settlers purchased additional land from the Mohawk in 1670 and 1672. (Jacques and Hilletie Van Slyck each received portions of land in the Mohawk 1672 deed for Schenectady.) Twenty years later (1684) Governor Thomas Dongan granted letters patent for Schenectady to five additional trustees.

On February 8, 1690, during King William&#x27;s War, French forces and their Indian allies, mostly Ojibwe and Algonquin warriors, attacked Schenectady by surprise, leaving 62 dead, 11 of them enslaved Africans. American history notes it as the Schenectady massacre. A total of 27 persons were taken captive, including five enslaved Africans; the raiders took their captives overland about 200 miles to Montreal and its associated Mohawk mission village of Kahnawake. Typically the younger captives were adopted by Mohawk families to replace people who had died. Through the early 18th century in the raiding between Quebec and the northern British colonies, some captives were ransomed by their communities. Colonial governments got involved only for high-ranking officers or other officials. In 1748, during King George&#x27;s War, the French and Indians attacked Schenectady again, killing 70 residents.

In 1765, Schenectady was incorporated as a borough. During the American Revolutionary War the local militia unit, the 2nd Albany County Militia Regiment, fought in the Battle of Saratoga and against Loyalist troops. Most of the wars in the Mohawk Valley were fought further west on the frontier in the areas of the German Palatine settlement which was west of Little Falls. Because of their close business and other relationships with the British, some settlers from the city were Loyalists and moved to Canada in the late stages of the Revolution. The Crown granted them land in what became known as Upper Canada and later Ontario.

===New Republic===
It was not until after the Revolutionary War that the village residents reduced the power of the descendants of the early trustees and gained representative government. The settlement was chartered as a city in 1798. Long interested in supporting higher education and morals, the members of the city&#x27;s three oldest churches—the Dutch First Reformed Church, St. Georges Episcopal Church, and First Presbyterian Church—formed a &quot;union&quot; and founded Union College in 1795 under a charter from the state. The school had started in 1785 as Schenectady Academy. This founding was part of the expansion of higher education in upstate New York in the postwar years.

During this period, migrants poured into upstate and western New York from New England, but there were also new immigrants from England and Europe. Many traveled west along the Mohawk River, settling in the western part of the state, where they developed more agriculture on former Iroquois lands. A dairy industry developed in the central part of the state. New settlers were predominantly of English and Scotch-Irish descent. In 1819, Schenectady suffered a fire that destroyed more than 170 buildings and most of its historic, distinctive Dutch-style architecture.

New York had passed a law for gradual abolition of slavery in 1799, however, in 1824, there were still a total of 102 slaves in Schenectady County with nearly half residing in the city. That year the city of Schenectady had a total population of 3939, which included 240 free blacks, 47 slaves, and 91 foreigners.

In the 19th century, after completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, Schenectady became an important transportation, manufacturing and trade center. By 1824, more of its population worked in manufacturing than agriculture or trade. Among the industries was a cotton mill, which processed cotton from the Deep South. It was one of many such mills in upstate whose products were part of the exports shipped out of New York City. The city and state had many economic ties to the South at the same time that some residents became active in the abolitionist movement.

Schenectady benefited by increased traffic connecting the Hudson River to the Mohawk Valley and the Great Lakes to the west and New York City to the south. The Albany and Schenectady Turnpike (now State Street) was constructed in 1797 to connect Albany to settlements in the Mohawk Valley. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad started operations in 1831 as one of the first railway lines in the United States, connecting the city and Albany by a route through the pine barrens between them. Developers in Schenectady quickly founded the Utica &amp; Schenectady Railroad, chartered in 1833; Schenectady &amp; Susquehanna Railroad, chartered May 5, 1836; and Schenectady &amp; Troy Railroad, chartered in 1836, making Schenectady &quot;the rail hub of America at the time&quot; and competing with the Erie Canal. Commodities from the Great Lakes areas and commercial products were shipped to the East and New York City through the Mohawk Valley and Schenectady.

The last slaves in Schenectady, New York, gained freedom in 1827, under the state&#x27;s gradual abolition law. The law first gave freedom to children born to slave mothers, but they were indentured to the mother&#x27;s master for a period into their early 20s. Union College established a school for black children in 1805, but discontinued it two years later. Methodists helped educate the children for a time but public schools did not accept them.

In the 1830s, the abolitionist movement grew in Schenectady. In 1836, Rev. Isaac Groot Duryee (also recorded as Duryea) co-founded the interracial Anti-Slavery Society at Union College and the Anti-Slavery Society of Schenectady in 1837. Freedom seekers were supported via the Underground Railroad route that ran through the area, passing to the west and north to Canada, which had abolished slavery.

In 1837, Duryee, together with others who were free people of color, co-founded the First Free Church of Schenectady (now the Duryee Memorial AME Zion Church). He also started a school for students of color. The abolitionist Theodore S. Wright, an African-American minister based in New York City, spoke at the church&#x27;s dedication and praised the school.

Through the late 19th century, new industries were established in the Mohawk Valley and powered by the river. Industrial jobs attracted many new immigrants, first from Ireland, and later in the century from Italy and Poland. In 1887, Thomas Edison moved his Edison Machine Works to Schenectady. In 1892, Schenectady became the headquarters of the General Electric Company. This business became a major industrial and economic force and helped establish the city and region as a national manufacturing center. GE became important nationally as a creative company, expanding into many different fields. American Locomotive Company also developed here, from a Schenectady company, and merging several smaller companies in 1901; it was second in the United States in the manufacture of steam locomotives before developing diesel technology.

===20th century to present===
Like other industrial cities in the Mohawk Valley, in the early 20th century, Schenectady attracted many new immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, as they could fill many of the new industrial jobs. It also attracted African Americans as part of the Great Migration out of the rural South to northern cities for work. General Electric and American Locomotive Company (ALCO) were industrial powerhouses, influencing innovation in a variety of fields across the country.

Schenectady is home to WGY, the second commercial radio station in the United States, (after WBZ in Springfield, Massachusetts, named for Westinghouse). WGY was named for its owner, General Electric (the G), and the city of Schenectady (the Y). In 1928, General Electric produced the first regular television broadcasts in the United States, when the experimental station W2XB began regular broadcasts on Thursday and Friday afternoons. This television station is now WRGB; for many years it was the Capital District&#x27;s NBC affiliate. It has been the area&#x27;s CBS affiliate since 1981.

The city reached its peak of population in 1930, approximately 95,000. The Great Depression caused a loss of jobs and population in its wake. In the postwar period after World War II, some residents moved to newer housing in suburban locations outside the city. In addition, General Electric established some high-tech facilities in the neighboring town of Niskayuna, which contributed to continuing population growth in the county. In the latter part of the 20th century, Schenectady suffered from the massive industrial and corporate restructuring that affected much of the US, including in the railroads. It lost many jobs and population to other locations, including offshore. Since the late 20th century, it has been shaping a new economy, based in part on renewable energy. Its population increased from 2000 to 2010.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which of it is land and of it (1.27%) is water.

It is part of the Capital District, the metropolitan area surrounding Albany, the state of New York&#x27;s capital. Along with Albany and Troy, it is one of the three principal population and industrial centers in the region.

Interstate 890 runs through Schenectady, and the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) is nearby. Amtrak has a station in Schenectady. The nearest airport is Schenectady County Airport; the nearest commercial airport is Albany International Airport.

ZIP code 12345, which is used by the GE plant in Schenectady, has attracted media attention on account of its simplicity. Thousands of letters and Christmas lists addressed to Santa Claus are mailed to the ZIP code every year.

Schenectady has a humid continental climate that is hot-summer (&quot;Dfa&quot;) bordering upon warm-summer (&quot;Dfb&quot;.) Average monthly temperatures range from in January to in July. These are estimates made by local amateur observers and aren&#x27;t official as Schenectady does not have a weather station of its own (its &quot;official&quot; temperatures come from nearby Albany).

==Economy==

Schenectady was a manufacturing center known as &quot;The City that Lights and Hauls the World&quot;—a reference to two prominent businesses in the city, the Edison Electric Company (now known as General Electric), and the American Locomotive Company (ALCO).

GE retains its steam turbine manufacturing facilities in Schenectady and its Global Research facility in nearby Niskayuna. Thousands of manufacturing jobs have been relocated from Schenectady to the Sun Belt and abroad. Corporate headquarters for GE Vernova are now in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

ALCO produced steam locomotives for railroads for years. Later it became renowned for its &quot;Superpower&quot; line of high-pressure locomotives, such as those for the Union Pacific Railroad in the 1930s and 1940s. During World War II, it converted to support the war, making tanks for the US Army. As diesel locomotives began to be manufactured, ALCO joined with GE to develop diesel locomotives to compete with GM&#x27;s EMD division. But corporate restructuring to cope with the changing locomotive procurement environment led to ALCO&#x27;s slow downward spiral. Its operations fizzled as it went through acquisitions and restructuring in the late 1960s. Its Schenectady plant closed in 1969.

In the late 20th century, due to industrial restructuring, the city lost many jobs and suffered difficult financial times, as did many former manufacturing cities in upstate New York. The loss of employment caused Schenectady&#x27;s population to decline by nearly one-third from 1950 into the late 20th century. The early industries had left many sites contaminated with hazardous wastes. Such environmental brownfields have needed technical approaches for redevelopment.

In the 21st century, Schenectady began revitalization. GE established a renewable energy center that brought hundreds of employees to the area. The city is part of a metropolitan area with improving economic health, and a number of buildings have been renovated for new uses. Numerous small businesses, retail stores and restaurants have developed on State Street downtown.

Price Chopper Supermarkets and the New York Lottery are based in Schenectady.

In December 2014, the state announced that the city was one of three sites selected for development of off-reservation casino gambling, under terms of a 2013 state constitutional amendment. The project would redevelop an ALCO brownfield site in the city along the waterfront, with hotels, housing and a marina in addition to the casino.

In February 2017, the Rivers Casino &amp; Resort opened with 66 table games and 1,150 slot machines on a 50,000-square-foot gambling floor with a steakhouse and a restaurant lounge. The $480 million (~$ in ) residential-retail project on 60 acres includes a marina, two hotels, condos, apartments and retail and office space for tech firms.

==Demographics==

In the census of 2010, there were 66,135 people, 26,265 (2000 data) households, and 14,051 (2000 data) families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 30,272 (2000 data) housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 59.38% (52.31% Non-Hispanic) (7.07 White-Hispanic) White, 24.19% African American, 14.47% Hispanic or Latin of any race, 8.24% from other races, 5.74% from two or more races, 2.62% Asian American, 0.69% Native American, and 0.14% Pacific Islander.

These reflect historic and early 20th-century immigration, as well as that since the late 20th century.

The Schenectady City School District is very diverse; (71%- 2011)(80%–2013) of district students receive free or reduced lunch. The student population of the school district is majority minority: 35% Black (48% Graduate), 32% White (71% Graduate), 18% Hispanic (51% Graduate), 15% Asian (68% Graduate). As of 2016, the graduation rate for the high school was 56%.

Using 2010 data, there were 28,264 households, out of which 31.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.0% were married couples living together, 24.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.5% were non-families. 38.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.98.

In the city, the year 2010 population was spread out, with 26.3% under the age of 18, 13.6% from 18 to 24, 30.7% from 25 to 44, 21.1% from 45 to 64, and 7.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32. For every 100 females, there were 92.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.4 males.

The median income for a household in the city in 2000 was $29,378 (2010–$37,436), and the median income for a family was $41,158. Males had a median income of $32,929 versus $26,856 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,076. About 20.2% of families and 25.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 41.5% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over.

=== Religion ===

The largest religious body is the Catholic church, with 44,000 adherents, followed by Islam, with 6,000 followers. The third largest religious body is the Reformed Church in America, with 3,600 members. The fourth is the United Methodist denomination, with 2,800 members.

Notable congregations are the First Presbyterian Church (Schenectady, New York), which is affiliated with the PCA. First Reformed Church RCA is formed in the 17th century, one of the oldest churches in the town. St George&#x27;s Episcopal Church dates back to 1735; it shared facilities with the Presbyterians for more than 30 years.

==Transportation==

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides regular service to Schenectady, with Schenectady station at 322 Erie Boulevard. Trains include the &quot;Ethan Allen,&quot; &quot;Adirondack,&quot; &quot;Lake Shore Limited,&quot; &quot;Maple Leaf,&quot; and &quot;Empire Service&quot;. Schenectady also has freight rail service from Canadian Pacific Railway and Norfolk Southern Railway.

The Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) provides bus service throughout Schenectady along with connections to the surrounding cities of Albany, Saratoga Springs, and Troy.

In the early 20th century, Schenectady had an extensive streetcar system that provided both local and interurban passenger service. The Schenectady Railway Co. had local lines and interurban lines serving Albany, Ballston Spa, Saratoga Springs and Troy. There was also a line from Gloversville, Johnstown, Amsterdam, and Scotia into Downtown Schenectady operated by the Fonda, Johnstown, and Gloversville Railroad. The nearly 200 leather and glove companies in the Gloversville region generated considerable traffic for the line. Sales representatives carrying product sample cases began their sales campaigns throughout the rest of the country by taking the interurban to reach Schenectady&#x27;s New York Central Railroad station, where they connected to trains to New York City, Chicago and points between.

The bright orange FJ&amp;G interurbans were scheduled to meet every daylight New York Central train that stopped at Schenectady. Through the 1900s and into the early 1930s, the line was quite prosperous. In 1932 the FJ&amp;G purchased five lightweight &quot;bullet cars&quot; (#125 through 129) from the J. G. Brill Company. These interurbans represented state-of-the-art design: the &quot;bullet&quot; description referred to the unusual front roof that was designed to slope down to the windshield in an aerodynamically sleek way. FJ&amp;G bought the cars believing that there would be continuing strong passenger business from a prosperous glove and leather industry, as well as legacy tourism traffic to Lake Sacandaga north of Gloversville. Instead, roads were improved, automobiles became cheaper and were purchased more widely, tourists traveled greater distances by car, and the Great Depression decreased business overall.

FJ&amp;G ridership continued to decline and in 1938 the state of New York condemned the line&#x27;s bridge over the Mohawk River at Schenectady. The bridge had once carried cars, pedestrians, and the interurban, but ice flow damage in 1928 prompted the state to restrict its use to the interurban. When the state condemned the bridge for interurban use, the line abandoned passenger service, and the bullet cars were sold. Freight business had also been important to the FJ&amp;G, and it continued over the risky bridge into Schenectady a few more years.

The Mohawk River at Schenectady is crossed by the Western Gateway Bridge, originally built in 1923-25, and replaced in 1971. From 1874 to 1925 the Mohawk River had been crossed by a bridge running from the foot of Washington Ave., Schenectady to Washington Ave., Scotia, a steel bridge built upon the seven piers of a former wooden bridge, built in 1808, called the Burr Bridge.

<text>Schenectady County () is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 158,061. The county seat is Schenectady. The name is from a Mohawk language word meaning &quot;on the other side of the pine lands,&quot; a term that originally applied to Albany. The county is part of the Capital District region of the state.

Schenectady County is part of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is west of the confluence of the Mohawk with the Hudson River. It includes territory on the north and the south sides of the Mohawk River.

==History==
This area of the river valley was historically occupied by the Mohawk people, the easternmost of the Five Nations comprising the Iroquois Confederacy or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;. They cultivated maize fields in the flats along the Mohawk River and had villages in the hills.

European settlement started in the present-day county by Dutch colonists in the 17th century; the village of Schenectady was founded in 1661. The fur traders in Albany kept a monopoly and prohibited settlers in Schenectady from the trade; those residents mostly became farmers. Other areas of the county were also developed for farming. The English enforced the Albany monopoly on the fur trade when they took over the New Netherland colony in 1664.

The English organized counties in the Province of New York in 1683; the area of the present-day Schenectady County was included in Albany County. Albany County contained an enormous area, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now within the state of Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, Albany County was divided to form two other counties. The area of Schenectady County was still within the reduced Albany.

From 1772 to 1786 Albany County included, besides the present territory of Albany County, all of the present Columbia, Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Schenectady counties, parts of the present Greene and Washington counties, and a piece of what is now southwestern Vermont.

In 1786 Albany County was reduced in size when Columbia County was organized; and again in 1791 by the splitting off of Rensselaer and Saratoga counties and the transfer of the Town of Cambridge to Washington County. It was further reduced in size in 1795 by the splitting off of a part that was combined with a portion of Otsego County to create Schoharie County. It was further reduced in size in 1800 by the splitting off of a part that was combined with a portion of Ulster County to create Greene County.

In 1809, Schenectady County was split from Albany County and has kept its current borders. The city of Schenectady was designated as the county seat and is the only city in the county. Major European immigration began in the mid-19th century, with the arrival of Irish refugees from the Great Famine. More immigrants were attracted to the city for its industrial jobs, including those from Italy and Poland. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city became an industrial powerhouse and center of innovation, the headquarters of General Electric and other national corporations.

The city of Schenectady reached its peak of population in 1930 but the county reached its peak in 1970, according to US Census data (see table below for county data.) These differences reflect different settlement patterns and the development of suburban housing outside the city limits. The city of Schenectady lost many jobs and population in the late 20th century due to industrial and railroad restructuring; some people stayed in the county working at alternative positions, including commuting to the capital of Albany.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.3%) is water.

Schenectady County is located in east central New York State, northwest of Albany, an area usually considered &quot;Upstate&quot;.

<text>A linguist in the academic sense is a person who studies natural language (an academic discipline known as linguistics). Ambiguously, the word is sometimes also used to refer to a polyglot (one who knows several languages), a translator/interpreter (especially in the military), or a grammarian (a scholar of grammar), but these uses of the word are distinct (and one does not have to be multilingual in order to be an academic linguist). The following is a list of notable academic linguists.

<text>Linguistics is the scientific study of language, involving analysis of language form, language meaning, and language in context.

Language use was first systematically documented in Mesopotamia, with extant lexical lists of the 3rd to the 2nd Millennia BCE, offering glossaries on Sumerian cuneiform usage and meaning, and phonetical vocabularies of foreign languages. Later, Sanskrit would be systematically analysed, and its rules described, by Pāṇini (fl. 6-4th century BCE), in the Indus Valley. Beginning around the 4th century BCE, Warring States period China also developed its own grammatical traditions. Aristotle laid the foundation of Western linguistics as part of the study of rhetoric in his &quot;Poetics&quot; . Traditions of Arabic grammar and Hebrew grammar developed during the Middle Ages in a religious context like Pānini&#x27;s Sanskrit grammar.

Modern approaches began to develop in the 18th century, eventually being regarded in the 19th century as belonging to the disciplines of psychology or biology, with such views establishing the foundation of mainstream Anglo-American linguistics, although in England philological approaches such as that of Henry Sweet tended to predominate.
This was contested in the early 20th century by Ferdinand de Saussure, who established linguistics as an autonomous discipline within social sciences. Following Saussure&#x27;s concept, general linguistics consists of the study of language as a semiotic system, which includes the subfields of phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Each of these subfields can be approached either synchronically or diachronicially.

Today, linguistics encompasses a large number of scientific approaches and has developed still more subfields, including applied linguistics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and computational linguistics.

==Antiquity==
Across cultures, the early history of linguistics is associated with a need to disambiguate discourse, especially for ritual texts or arguments. This often led to explorations of sound-meaning mappings, and the debate over conventional versus naturalistic origins for these symbols. Finally, this led to the processes by which larger structures are formed from units.

=== Babylonia ===
The earliest linguistic texts – written in cuneiform on clay tablets – date almost four thousand years before the present. In the early centuries of the second millennium BCE, in southern Mesopotamia, there arose a grammatical tradition that lasted more than 2,500 years. The linguistic texts from the earliest parts of the tradition were lists of nouns in Sumerian (a language isolate, that is, a language with no known genetic relatives), the language of religious and legal texts at the time. Sumerian was being replaced in everyday speech by a very different (and unrelated) language, Akkadian; it remained however as a language of prestige and continued to be used in religious and legal contexts. It therefore had to be taught as a foreign language, and to facilitate this, information about Sumerian was recorded in writing by Akkadian-speaking scribes.

Over the centuries, the lists became standardised, and the Sumerian words were provided with Akkadian translations. Ultimately texts emerged that gave Akkadian equivalents for not just single words, but for entire paradigms of varying forms for words: one text, for instance, has 227 different forms of the verb &quot;ĝar&quot; &quot;to place&quot;.

===India===

Linguistics in ancient India derives its impetus from the need to correctly recite and interpret the Vedic texts. Already in the oldest Indian text, the Rigveda, (&quot;speech&quot;) is deified. By 1200 BCE, the oral performance of these texts becomes standardized, and treatises on ritual recitation suggest splitting up the Sanskrit compounds into words, stems, and phonetic units, providing an impetus for morphology and phonetics.

Some of the earliest activities in the description of language have been attributed to the Indian grammarian Pāṇini (6th century BCE), who wrote a rule-based description of the Sanskrit language in his &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot;.

Over the next few centuries, clarity was reached in the organization of sound units, and the stop consonants were organized in a 5x5 square (, Pratisakhyas), eventually leading to a systematic alphabet, Brāhmī, by the 3rd century BCE.

In semantics, the early Sanskrit grammarian Śākaṭāyana (before ) proposes that verbs represent ontologically prior categories, and that all nouns are etymologically derived from actions. The etymologist Yāska (c. 5th century BCE) posits that meaning inheres in the sentence, and that word meanings are derived based on sentential usage. He also provides four categories of words—nouns, verbs, pre-verbs, and particles/invariants—and a test for nouns both concrete and abstract: words which can be indicated by the pronoun &quot;that&quot;.

Pāṇini (c. 6th century BCE) opposes the Yāska view that sentences are primary, and proposes a grammar for composing semantics from morphemic roots. Transcending the ritual text to consider living language, Pāṇini specifies a comprehensive set of about 4,000 aphoristic rules (&quot;sutras&quot;) that:

# Map the semantics of verb argument structures into thematic roles
# Provide morphosyntactic rules for creating verb forms and nominal forms whose seven cases are called &quot;karaka&quot; (similar to case) that generate the morphology
# Take these morphological structures and consider phonological processes (e.g., root or stem modification) by which the final phonological form is obtained
In addition, the Pāṇinian school also provides a list of 2000 verb roots which form the objects on which these rules are applied, a list of sounds (the so-called &quot;Shiva-sutras&quot;), and a list of 260 words not derivable by the rules.

The extremely succinct specification of these rules and their complex interactions led to considerable commentary and extrapolation over the following centuries. The phonological structure includes defining a notion of sound universals similar to the modern phoneme, the systematization of consonants based on oral cavity constriction, and vowels based on height and duration. However, it is the ambition of mapping these from morpheme to semantics that is truly remarkable in modern terms.

Grammarians following Pāṇini include Kātyāyana (c. 3rd century BCE), who wrote aphorisms on Pāṇini (the &quot;Varttika&quot;) and advanced mathematics; Patañjali (2nd century BCE), known for his commentary on selected topics in Pāṇini&#x27;s grammar (the &quot;Mahabhasya&quot;) and on Kātyāyana&#x27;s aphorisms, as well as, according to some, the author of the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;, and &quot;Pingala&quot;, with his mathematical approach to prosody. Several debates ranged over centuries, for example, on whether word-meaning mappings were conventional (&quot;Vaisheshika-Nyaya&quot;) or eternal (&quot;Kātyāyana-Patañjali-Mīmāṃsā&quot;).

The &quot;Nyaya Sutras&quot; specified three types of meaning: the individual (&quot;this cow&quot;), the type universal (&quot;cowhood&quot;), and the image (&quot;draw the cow&quot;).
That the sound of a word also forms a class (sound-universal) was observed by Bhartṛhari (c. 500 CE), who also posits that language-universals are the units of thought, close to the nominalist or even the linguistic determinism position. Bhartṛhari also considers the sentence to be ontologically primary (word meanings are learned given their sentential use).

Of the six canonical texts or &quot;Vedangas&quot; that formed the core syllabus in Brahminic education from the 1st century CE until the 18th century, four dealt with language:
*&quot;Shiksha&quot; (&quot;&quot;): phonetics and phonology (sandhi), Gārgeya and commentators
*&quot;Chandas&quot; (&quot;&quot;): prosody or meter, Pingala and commentators
*&quot;Vyakarana&quot; (&quot;&quot;): grammar, Pāṇini and commentators
*&quot;Nirukta&quot; (&quot;&quot;): etymology, Yāska and commentators

Bhartrihari around 500 CE introduced a philosophy of meaning with his &quot;sphoṭa&quot; doctrine.

Pāṇini&#x27;s rule-based method of linguistic analysis and description has remained relatively unknown to Western linguistics until more recently. Franz Bopp used Pāṇini&#x27;s work as a linguistic source for his 1807 Sanskrit grammar but disregarded his methodology. Pāṇini&#x27;s system also differs from modern formal linguistics in that, since Sanskrit is a free word-order language, it did not provide syntactic rules. Formal linguistics, as first proposed by Louis Hjelmslev in 1943, is nonetheless based on the same concept that the expression of meaning is organised on different layers of linguistic form (including phonology and morphology).

The Pali Grammar of Kacchayana, dated to the early centuries CE, describes the language of the Buddhist canon.

===Greece===
The Greeks developed an alphabet using symbols from the Phoenicians, adding signs for vowels and for extra consonants appropriate to their idiom (see Robins, 1997). In the Phoenicians and in earlier Greek writing systems, such as Linear B, graphemes indicated syllables, that is sound combinations of a consonant and a vowel. The addition of vowels by the Greeks was a major breakthrough as it facilitated the writing of Greek by representing both vowels and consonants with distinct graphemes. As a result of the introduction of writing, poetry such as the Homeric poems became written and several editions were created and commented on, forming the basis of philology and criticism.

Along with written speech, the Greeks commenced studying grammatical and philosophical issues. A philosophical discussion about the nature and origins of language can be found as early as the works of Plato. A subject of concern was whether language was man-made, a social artifact, or supernatural in origin. Plato in his &quot;Cratylus&quot; presents the naturalistic view, that word meanings emerge from a natural process, independent of the language user. His arguments are partly based on examples of compounding, where the meaning of the whole is usually related to the constituents, although by the end he admits a small role for convention. The sophists and Socrates introduced dialectics as a new text genre. The Platonic dialogs contain definitions of the meters of the poems and tragedy, the form and the structure of those texts (see the &quot;Republic&quot; and &quot;Phaidros&quot;, &quot;Ion&quot;, etc.).

Aristotle supports the conventional origins of meaning. He defined the logic of speech and of the argument. Furthermore, Aristotle&#x27;s works on rhetoric and poetics became of the utmost importance for the understanding of tragedy, poetry, public discussions etc. as text genres. Aristotle&#x27;s work on logic interrelates with his special interest in language, and his work on this area was fundamentally important for the development of the study of language (&quot;logos&quot; in Greek means both &quot;language&quot; and &quot;logic reasoning&quot;). In &quot;Categories&quot;, Aristotle defines what is meant by &quot;synonymous&quot; or univocal words, what is meant by &quot;homonymous&quot; or equivocal words, and what is meant by &quot;paronymous&quot; or denominative words. He divides forms of speech as being:

* Either simple, without composition or structure, such as &quot;man,&quot; &quot;horse,&quot; &quot;fights,&quot; etc.
* Or having composition and structure, such as &quot;a man fights,&quot; &quot;the horse runs,&quot; etc.

Next, he distinguishes between a subject of predication, namely that of which anything is affirmed or denied, and a subject of inhesion. A thing is said to be inherent in a subject, when, though it is not a part of the subject, it cannot possibly exist without the subject, e.g., shape in a thing having a shape. The categories are not abstract platonic entities but are found in speech, these are substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action and affection. In &quot;de Interpretatione&quot;, Aristotle analyzes categoric propositions, and draws a series of basic conclusions on the routine issues of classifying and defining basic linguistic forms, such as simple terms and propositions, nouns and verbs, negation, the quantity of simple propositions (primitive roots of the quantifiers in modern symbolic logic), investigations on the excluded middle (which to Aristotle isn&#x27;t applicable to future tense propositions — the Problem of future contingents), and on modal propositions.

The Stoics made linguistics an important part of their system of the cosmos and the human. They played an important role in defining the linguistic sign-terms adopted later on by Ferdinand de Saussure like &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;signifié&quot;. The Stoics studied phonetics, grammar and etymology as separate levels of study. In phonetics and phonology the articulators were defined. The syllable became an important structure for the understanding of speech organization. One of the most important contributions of the Stoics in language study was the gradual definition of the terminology and theory echoed in modern linguistics.

Alexandrian grammarians also studied speech sounds and prosody; they defined parts of speech with notions such as &quot;noun&quot;, &quot;verb&quot;, etc. There was also a discussion about the role of analogy in language, in this discussion the grammatici in Alexandria supported the view that language and especially morphology is based on analogy or paradigm, whereas the grammatic in schools in Asia Minor consider that language is not based on analogical bases but rather on exceptions.

Alexandrians, like their predecessors, were very interested in meter and its role in poetry. The metrical &quot;feet&quot; in the Greek was based on the length of time taken to pronounce each syllable, with syllables categorized according to their weight as either &quot;long&quot; syllables or &quot;short&quot; syllables (also known as &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;light&quot; syllables, respectively, to distinguish them from long and short vowels). The foot is often compared to a musical measure and the long and short syllables to whole notes and half notes. The basic unit in Greek and Latin prosody is a mora, which is defined as a single short syllable. A long syllable is equivalent to two moras. A long syllable contains either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a short vowel followed by two or more consonants.

Various rules of elision sometimes prevent a grammatical syllable from making a full syllable, and certain other lengthening and shortening rules (such as correption) can create long or short syllables in contexts where one would expect the opposite. The most important Classical meter as defined by the Alexandrian grammarians was the dactylic hexameter, the meter of Homeric poetry. This form uses verses of six feet. The first four feet are normally dactyls, but can be spondees. The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl. The sixth foot is either a spondee or a trochee. The initial syllable of either foot is called the ictus, the basic &quot;beat&quot; of the verse. There is usually a caesura after the ictus of the third foot.

The text &quot;Tékhnē grammatiké&quot; (c. 100 BCE, Gk. &quot;gramma&quot; meant letter, and this title means &quot;Art of letters&quot;), possibly written by Dionysius Thrax (170 – 90 BCE), is considered the earliest grammar book in the Greek tradition. It lists eight parts of speech and lays out the broad details of Greek morphology including the case structures. This text was intended as a pedagogic guide (as was Panini), and also covers punctuation and some aspects of prosody. Other grammars by Charisius (mainly a compilation of Thrax, as well as lost texts by Remmius Palaemon and others) and Diomedes (focusing more on prosody) were popular in Rome as pedagogic material for teaching Greek to native Latin-speakers.

One of the most prominent scholars of Alexandria and of the antiquity was Apollonius Dyscolus. Apollonius wrote more than thirty treatises on questions of syntax, semantics, morphology, prosody, orthography, dialectology, and more. Happily, four of these are preserved—we still have a &quot;Syntax&quot; in four books, and three one-book monographs on pronouns, adverbs, and connectives, respectively.

Lexicography become an important domain of study as many grammarians compiled dictionaries, thesauri and lists of special words &quot;λέξεις&quot; that were old, or dialectical or special (such as medical words or botanic words) at that period. In the early medieval times we find more categories of dictionaries like the dictionary of Suida (considered the first encyclopedic dictionary), etymological dictionaries etc.

At that period, the Greek language functioned as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;, a language spoken throughout the known world (for the Greeks and Romans) of that time and, as a result, modern linguistics struggles to overcome this. With the Greeks a tradition commenced in the study of language. The terminology invented by Greek and Latin grammarians in the ancient world and medieval period continue as a part of our everyday language. Think, for example, of notions such as the word, the syllable, the verb, the subject etc.

===Rome===

In the 4th century, Aelius Donatus compiled the Latin grammar &quot;Ars Grammatica&quot; that was to be the defining school text through the Middle Ages. A smaller version, &quot;Ars Minor&quot;, covered only the eight parts of speech; eventually when books came to be printed in the 15th century, this was one of the first books to be printed. Schoolboys subjected to all this education gave us the current meaning of &quot;grammar&quot; (attested in English since 1176).

===China===
Similar to the Indian tradition, Chinese philology () emerged as an aid to understanding the Chinese classics , during the Western Han dynasty. Philology came to be divided into three branches: exegesis (), grammatology () and phonology (). The field reached its golden age in the 17th century, during the Qing dynasty. The &quot;Erya&quot; (), comparable to the Indian &quot;Nighantu&quot;, is a regarded as the first linguistic work in China. &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; (), the first Chinese dictionary, classifies Chinese characters by radicals, a practice that would be followed by most subsequent lexicographers. Two more pioneering works produced during the Han dynasty are &quot;Fangyan&quot;, the first Chinese work concerning dialects, and &quot;Shiming&quot;, devoted to etymology.

As in ancient Greece, early Chinese thinkers were concerned with the relationship between names and reality. Confucius () famously emphasized the moral commitment implicit in a name, (&quot;zhengming&quot;) stating that the moral collapse of the pre-Qin was a result of the failure to rectify behaviour to meet the moral commitment inherent in names: &quot;Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son... If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.&quot; (&quot;Analects&quot; 12.11, 13.3).
However, what is the reality implied by a name? The later Mohists or the group known as School of Names,
consider that a name ( may refer to three kinds of actuality (): type universals (horse), individual (John), and unrestricted (thing). They adopt a realist position on the name-reality connectionuniversals arise because &quot;the world itself fixes the patterns of similarity and difference by which things should be divided into kinds&quot;. The philosophical tradition features a well known conundrum &quot;a white horse is not a horse&quot; by Gongsun Longzi (4th century  BCE), which resembles those of the sophists; Gongsun questions if in copula statements (&quot;X is Y&quot;), are &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; identical or is &quot;X&quot; a subclass of &quot;Y&quot;.

Xunzi () revisits the principle of &quot;zhengming&quot;, but instead of rectifying behaviour to suit the names, his emphasis is on rectifying language to correctly reflect reality. This is consistent with a more &quot;conventional&quot; view of word origins.

The study of phonology in China began late, and was influenced by the Indian tradition, after Buddhism had become popular in China. The rime dictionary is a type of dictionary arranged by tone and rime, in which the pronunciations of characters are indicated by &quot;fanqie&quot; spellings. Rime tables were later produced to aid the understanding of &quot;fanqie&quot;.

Philological studies flourished during the Qing dynasty, with Duan Yucai and Wang Niansun as the towering figures. The last great philologist of the era was Zhang Binglin, who also helped lay the foundation of modern Chinese linguistics. The Western comparative method was brought into China by Bernard Karlgren, the first scholar to reconstruct Middle Chinese and Old Chinese with Latin alphabet (not IPA). Important modern Chinese linguists include Yuen Ren Chao, Luo Changpei, Li Fanggui and Wang Li.

Ancient commentators on the classics focused their attention on lexical content and the function of linking words rather than syntax; the first modern Chinese grammar was produced by Ma Jianzhong (late 19th century), based on a Western model.

==Middle Ages==

===Arabic grammar===

Owing to the rapid expansion of Islam in the 8th century, many people learned Arabic as a lingua franca. For this reason, the earliest grammatical treatises on Arabic are often written by non-native speakers.

The earliest grammarian who is known to us is  (died 735-736 CE, 117 AH). The efforts of three generations of grammarians culminated in the book of the Persian linguist  (c. 760–793).

Sibawayh made a detailed and professional description of Arabic in 760 in his monumental work, &quot;Al-kitab fi al-nahw&quot; (الكتاب في النحو, &quot;The Book on Grammar&quot;). In his book he distinguished phonetics from phonology.

===European vernaculars===
The Irish &quot;Sanas Cormaic&quot; &#x27;Cormac&#x27;s Glossary&#x27; (10th century) is Europe&#x27;s first etymological and encyclopedic dictionary in any non-Classical language. The Auraicept na n-Éces, compiled over the course of several centuries — possibly starting as early as in the 8th century — is a treatise on that same language and the first instance of a philosophical defence of a spoken European vernacular over Latin.

A milestone in the early history of Germanic linguistics, the First Grammatical Treatise (12th century) offers a wealth of information on Old Norse lexicon, grammar and phonology.

In the 13th century, the Modistae or &quot;speculative grammarians&quot; introduced the notion of universal grammar. In the treatise &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot; (&quot;On the Eloquence of Vernacular&quot;), dating to 1303-1305, the Italian poet Dante presented a theory of language and discussed the origin of languages after the confusion of tongues following the events of the Tower of Babel. By recognizing the instrinsically human nature of language, Dante first recognized that — like customs and traditions — languages are bound to evolve over time and to differentiate in space giving birth to dialects. He argued that the wave of human populations migrating westward to Europe after the confusion of tongues were already differentiated into three linguistic families: the Greek family, one that can be defined as Slavo-Germanic, and the one that is today known as Romance family. Each of these families independently underwent differentiation into several branching languages. The Romance family, in particular, appeared to Dante as split into three closely related languages, namely Old French (&quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;), Old Occitan (&quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot;) and Italian (&quot;lingua del sì&quot;). The writer then focused on the additional subdivision of Italian into 14 dialectal varieties, whence it could be possible to extract a noble and elevated vulgar language not inferior in dignity to Latin. 

The Renaissance and Baroque period saw an intensified interest in linguistics, notably for the purpose of Bible translations by the Jesuits, and also related to philosophical speculation on philosophical languages and the origin of language.

In the 1600s, Joannes Goropius Becanus was the oldest representative of Dutch linguistics. He was the first person to publish a fragment of Gothic, mainly The lord&#x27;s prayer. Franciscus Juniuns, Lambert ten Kate from Amsterdam and George Hickes from England are considered to be the founding fathers of Germanic linguistics.

==Modern linguistics==

Modern linguistics did not begin until the late 18th century, and the Romantic or animist theses of Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Christoph Adelung remained influential well into the 19th century.

In the history of American linguistics, there were hundreds of Indigenous languages that were never recorded. Many of the languages were spoken, not written, and so they are now inaccessible. Under these circumstances, linguists such as Franz Boas tried to prescribe sound methodical principles for the analysis of unfamiliar languages. Boas was an influential linguist and was followed by Edward Sapir and Leonard Bloomfield.

===Historical linguistics===

During the 18th century conjectural history, based on a mix of linguistics and anthropology, on the topic of both the origin and progress of language and society was fashionable. These thinkers contributed to the construction of academic paradigms in which some languages were labelled &quot;primitive&quot; relative to the English language. Hugh Blair wrote that for Native Americans, certain motions and actions were found to convey meaning as much as what was said verbally. Around the same time, James Burnett authored a 6 volume treatise that delved more deeply into the matter of &quot;savage languages&quot;. Other writers theorized that Native American languages were &quot;nothing but the natural and instinctive cries of the animal&quot; without grammatical structure. The thinkers within this paradigm connected themselves with the Greeks and Romans, viewed as the only civilized persons of the ancient world, a view articulated by Thomas Sheridan who compiled an important 18th century pronunciation dictionary: &quot;It was to the care taken in the cultivation of their languages, that Greece and Rome, owed that splendor, which eclipsed all the other nations of the world&quot;.

In the 18th century James Burnett, Lord Monboddo analyzed numerous languages and deduced logical elements of the evolution of human languages. His thinking was interleaved with his precursive concepts of biological evolution. Some of his early concepts have been validated and are considered correct today. In his &quot;The Sanscrit Language&quot; (1786), Sir William Jones proposed that Sanskrit and Persian had resemblances to Classical Greek, Latin, Gothic, and Celtic languages. From this idea sprung the field of comparative linguistics and historical linguistics. Through the 19th century, European linguistics centered on the comparative history of the Indo-European languages, with a concern for finding their common roots and tracing their development.

In the 1820s, Wilhelm von Humboldt observed that human language was a rule-governed system, anticipating a theme that was to become central in the formal work on syntax and semantics of language in the 20th century. Of this observation he said that it allowed language to make &quot;infinite use of finite means&quot; (&quot;Über den Dualis&quot;, 1827). Humboldt&#x27;s work is associated with the movement of Romantic linguistics, which was inspired by &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; and Romantic science. Other notable representatives of the movement include Friedrich Schlegel and Franz Bopp.

It was only in the late 19th century that the Neogrammarian approach of Karl Brugmann and others introduced a rigid notion of sound law.

Historical linguistics also led to the emergence of the semantics and some forms of pragmatics (Nerlich, 1992; Nerlich and Clarke, 1996).

Historical linguistics continues today and linguistics have succeeded in grouping approximately 5000 languages of the world into a number of common ancestors.

===Structuralism===

In Europe there was a development of structural linguistics, initiated by Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss professor of Indo-European and general linguistics, whose lectures on general linguistics, published posthumously by his students, set the direction of European linguistic analysis from the 1920s on; his approach has been widely adopted in other fields under the broad term &quot;Structuralism&quot;.

By the 20th century, the attention shifted from language change to the structure, which is governed by rules and principles. This structure turned more into grammar and by the 1920s structural linguistic, was developing into sophisticated methods of grammatical analysis.

===Descriptive linguistics===

During the second World War, North American linguists Leonard Bloomfield, William Mandeville Austin and several of his students and colleagues developed teaching materials for a variety of languages whose knowledge was needed for the war effort. This work led to an increasing prominence of the field of linguistics, which became a recognized discipline in most American universities only after the war.

In 1965, William Stokoe, Carl G. Croneberg, and Dorothy C. Casterline linguists from Gallaudet University published an analysis which proved that American Sign Language fits the criteria for a natural language.

===Generative linguistics===

Generative linguistics focuses on modeling the subconscious rules governing language. It started with Noam Chomsky’s Transformational Grammar and has evolved into various theories like Government and Binding and the Minimalist Program. Core principles include the distinction between competence and performance, the role of innate grammar (Universal Grammar), and the use of explicit, formal models to describe linguistic knowledge.

===Other subfields===

From roughly 1980 onwards, pragmatic, functional, and cognitive approaches have steadily gained ground, both in the United States and in Europe.

<text>Theoretical linguistics is a term in linguistics that, like the related term general linguistics, can be understood in different ways. Both can be taken as a reference to the theory of language, or the branch of linguistics that inquires into the nature of language and seeks to answer fundamental questions as to what language is, or what the common ground of all languages is. The goal of theoretical linguistics can also be the construction of a general theoretical framework for the description of language.

Another use of the term depends on the organisation of linguistics into different sub-fields. The term theoretical linguistics is commonly juxtaposed with applied linguistics. This perspective implies that the aspiring language professional, e.g. a student, must first learn the &quot;theory&quot; i.e. properties of the linguistic system, or what Ferdinand de Saussure called &quot;internal linguistics&quot;. This is followed by &quot;practice,&quot; or studies in the applied field. The dichotomy is not fully unproblematic because language pedagogy, language technology and other aspects of applied linguistics also include theory.

Similarly, the term general linguistics is used to distinguish core linguistics from other types of study. However, because college and university linguistics is largely distributed with the institutes and departments of a relatively small number of national languages, some larger universities also offer courses and research programmes in &#x27;general linguistics&#x27; which may cover exotic and minority languages, cross-linguistic studies and various other topics outside the scope of the main philological departments.

==Fields of linguistics proper==
When the concept of theoretical linguistics is taken to refer to &quot;core&quot; or &quot;internal linguistics&quot;, it means the study of the parts of the language system. This traditionally means phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics. Pragmatics and discourse can also be included; delimitation varies between institutions. Furthermore, Saussure&#x27;s definition of general linguistics consists of the dichotomy of synchronic and diachronic linguistics, thus including historical linguistics as a core issue.

==Linguistic theories==
There are various frameworks of linguistic theory which include a general theory of language and a general theory of linguistic description. Current humanistic approaches include theories within structural linguistics and functional linguistics. In addition to the humanistic approaches of structural linguistics and functional linguistics, the field of theoretical linguistics encompasses other frameworks and perspectives. Evolutionary linguistics is one such framework that investigates the origins and development of language from an evolutionary and cognitive perspective. It incorporates various models within generative grammar, which seeks to explain language structure through formal rules and transformations. Cognitive linguistics and cognitive approaches to grammar, on the other hand, focuses on the relationship between language and cognition, exploring how language reflects and influences our thought processes.

<text>In computer data storage, drive letter assignment is the process of assigning alphabetical identifiers to volumes. Unlike the concept of UNIX mount points, where volumes are named and located arbitrarily in a single hierarchical namespace, drive letter assignment allows multiple highest-level namespaces. Drive letter assignment is thus a process of using letters to name the roots of the &quot;forest&quot; representing the file system; each volume holds an independent &quot;tree&quot; (or, for non-hierarchical file systems, an independent list of files).

==Origin==
The concept of drive letters, as used today, presumably owes its origins to IBM&#x27;s VM family of operating systems, dating back to CP/CMS in 1967 (and its research predecessor CP-40), by way of Digital Research&#x27;s (DRI) CP/M. The concept evolved through several steps:

* CP/CMS uses drive letters to identify &quot;minidisks&quot; attached to a user session. A full file reference (&quot;pathname&quot; in today&#x27;s parlance) consists of a &quot;filename&quot;, a &quot;filetype&quot;, and a disk letter called a &quot;filemode&quot; (e.g. A or B). Minidisks can correspond to physical disk drives, but more typically refer to logical drives, which are mapped automatically onto shared devices by the operating system as sets of &quot;virtual cylinders&quot;.
* CP/CMS inspired numerous other operating systems, including the CP/M microcomputer operating system, which uses a drive letter to specify a physical storage device. Early versions of CP/M (and other microcomputer operating systems) implemented a flat file system on each disk drive, where a complete file reference consists of a &quot;drive letter&quot;, a colon, a &quot;filename&quot; (up to eight characters), a dot, and a &quot;filetype&quot; (three characters); for instance codice_1. (This was the era of 8-inch floppy disks, where such small namespaces did not impose practical constraints.) This usage was influenced by the device prefixes used in Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s (DEC) TOPS-10 operating system.
* The drive letter syntax chosen for CP/M was inherited by Microsoft for its operating system MS-DOS by way of Seattle Computer Products&#x27; (SCP) 86-DOS, and thus also by IBM&#x27;s OEM version PC DOS. Originally, drive letters always represented physical volumes, but support for logical volumes eventually appeared.
* Through their designated position as DOS successor, the concept of drive letters was also inherited by OS/2 and the Microsoft Windows family.

The important capability of hierarchical directories within each drive letter was initially absent from these systems. This was a major feature of UNIX and other similar operating systems, where hard disk drives held thousands (rather than tens or hundreds) of files. Increasing microcomputer storage capacities led to their introduction, eventually followed by long filenames. In file systems lacking such naming mechanisms, drive letter assignment proved a useful, simple organizing principle.

==Order of assignment==

MS-DOS/PC DOS since version 5.0, and later operating systems, assigns drive letters according to the following algorithm:

# Assign the drive letter A: to the first floppy disk drive (drive 0), and B: to the second floppy disk drive (drive 1). If only one physical floppy is present, drive B: will be assigned to a phantom floppy drive mapped to the same physical drive and dynamically assigned to either A: or B: for easier floppy file operations. If no physical floppy drive is present, DOS 4.0 will assign both A: and B: to the non-existent drive, whereas DOS 5.0 and higher will invalidate these drive letters. If more than two physical floppy drives are present, DOS versions prior to 5.0 will assign subsequent drive letters, whereas DOS 5.0 and higher will remap these drives to higher drive letters at a later stage; see below.
# Assign a drive letter to the first active primary partition recognized upon the first physical hard disk. DOS 5.0 and higher will ensure that it will become drive C:, so that the boot drive will either have drive A: or C:.
# Assign subsequent drive letters to the first primary partition upon each successive physical hard disk drive (DOS versions prior to 5.0 will probe for only two physical hard disks, whereas DOS 5.0 and higher support eight physical hard disks).
# Assign subsequent drive letters to every recognized logical partition present in the first extended partition, beginning with the first hard drive and proceeding through successive physical hard disk drives.
# DOS 5.0 and higher: Assign drive letters to all remaining primary partitions, beginning with the first hard drive and proceeding through successive physical hard disk drives.
# DOS 5.0 and higher: Assign drive letters to all physical floppy drives beyond the second physical floppy drive.
# Assign subsequent drive letters to any block device drivers loaded in CONFIG.SYS via DEVICE statements, e.g. RAM disks.
# Assign subsequent drive letters to any dynamically loaded drives via CONFIG.SYS INSTALL statements, in AUTOEXEC.BAT or later, i.e. additional optical disc drives (MSCDEX etc.), PCMCIA / PC Card drives, USB or Firewire drives, or network drives.

* Only partitions of recognized partition types are assigned letters. In particular, &quot;hidden partitions&quot; (those with their type ID changed to an unrecognized value, usually by adding codice_2) are not.

MS-DOS/PC DOS versions 4.0 and earlier assign letters to all of the floppy drives before considering hard drives, so a system with four floppy drives would call the first hard drive E:. Starting with DOS 5.0, the system ensures that drive C: is always a hard disk, even if the system has more than two physical floppy drives.

While without deliberate remapping, the drive letter assignments are typically fixed until the next reboot, however, Zenith MS-DOS 3.21 will update the drive letter assignments when resetting a drive. This may cause drive letters to change without reboot if the partitioning of the harddisk was changed.

MS-DOS on the Apricot PC assigns letters to hard drives, starting with A:, before considering floppy drives. A system with two of each drive would call the hard drives A: and B:, and the floppies C: and D:.

On the Japanese PC-98, if the system is booted from floppy disk, the dedicated version of MS-DOS assigns letters to all floppy drives before considering hard drives; it does the opposite if it is booted from a hard drive, that is, if the OS was installed on the hard drive, MS-DOS would assign this drive as drive &quot;A:&quot; and a potentially existing floppy as drive &quot;B:&quot;. The Japanese version of the Windows 95 SETUP program supports a special option /AT to enforce that Windows will be on drive C:.

Some versions of DOS do not assign the drive letter, beginning with C:, to the first active primary partition recognized upon the first physical hard disk, but on the first primary partition recognized of the first hard disk, even if it is not set active.

If there is more than one extended partition in a partition table, only the logical drives in the first recognized extended partition type are processed.

Some late versions of the DR-DOS IBMBIO.COM provide a preboot config structure, holding bit flags to select (beside others) between various drive letter assignment strategies. These strategies can be preselected by a user or OEM or be changed by a boot loader on the fly when launching DR-DOS. Under these issues, the boot drive can be different from A: or C: as well.

The drive letter order can depend on whether a given disk is managed by a boot-time driver or by a dynamically loaded driver. For example, if the second or third hard disk is of SCSI type and, on DOS, requires drivers loaded through the CONFIG.SYS file (e.g. the controller card does not offer on-board BIOS or using this BIOS is not practical), then the first SCSI primary partition will appear after all the IDE partitions on DOS. Therefore, DOS and for example OS/2 could have different drive letters, as OS/2 loads the SCSI driver earlier. A solution was not to use primary partitions on such hard disks.

In Windows NT and OS/2, the operating system uses the aforementioned algorithm to automatically assign letters to floppy disk drives, optical disc drives, the boot disk, and other recognized volumes that are not otherwise created by an administrator within the operating system. Volumes that are created within the operating system are manually specified, and some of the automatic drive letters can be changed. Unrecognized volumes are not assigned letters, and are usually left untouched by the operating system.

A common problem that occurs with the drive letter assignment is that the letter assigned to a network drive can interfere with the letter of a local volume (like a newly installed CD/DVD drive or a USB stick). For example, if the last local drive is drive D: and a network drive would have been assigned as E:, then a newly attached USB mass storage device would also be assigned drive E: causing loss of connectivity with either the network share or the USB device. Users with administrative privileges can assign drive letters manually to overcome this problem.
Another condition that can cause problems on Windows XP is when there are network drives defined, but in an error condition (as they would be on a laptop operating outside the network). Even when the unconnected network drive is not the next available drive letter, Windows XP may be unable to map a drive and this error may also prevent the mounting of the USB device.

== Common assignments ==
Applying the scheme discussed above on a fairly modern Windows-based system typically results in the following drive letter assignments:
*A: — Floppy disk drives, ″ or ″, and possibly other types of disk drives, if present.
*B: — Reserved for a second floppy drive (that was present on many PCs).
*C: — First hard disk drive partition.
*D: to Z: — Other disk partitions get labeled here. Windows assigns the next free drive letter to the next drive it encounters while enumerating the disk drives on the system. Drives can be partitioned, thereby creating more drive letters. This applies to MS-DOS, as well as all Windows operating systems. Windows offers other ways to change the drive letters, either through the Disk Management snap-in or codice_3. MS-DOS typically uses parameters on the line loading device drivers inside the CONFIG.SYS file.
Case-specific drive letters:
*F: — First network drive if using Novell NetWare.
*G: — &quot;Google Drive File Stream&quot; if using Google Drive.
*H: — &quot;Home&quot; directory on a network server.
*L: — Dynamically assigned load drive under Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32.
*M: — Drive letter for optionally memory drive MDISK under Concurrent DOS.
*N:, O:, P: — Assignable floating drives under CP/M-86 4.x, Personal CP/M-86 2.x, DOS Plus 1.1-2.1 (via BDOS call 0Fh), a concept later extended to any unused drive letters under Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager, REAL/32 and DR DOS up to 6.0.
*Q: — Microsoft Office Click-to-Run virtualization.
*U: — Unix-like &quot;unified filesystem&quot; with virtual directory codice_4 for device files under MiNT, MagiC, and MultiTOS.
*Z: — First network drive if using Banyan VINES, and the initial drive letter assignment for the virtual disk network in the DOSBox x86 emulator. It is also the first letter selected by Windows for network resources, as it automatically selects from Z: downwards. By default, Wine maps Z: to the root of the UNIX directory tree.

When there is no second physical floppy drive, drive B: can be used as a &quot;virtual&quot; floppy drive mapped onto the physical drive A:, whereby the user would be prompted to switch floppies every time a read or write was required to whichever was the least recently used of A: or B:. This allows for much of the functionality of two floppy drives on a computer that has only one. This concept of multiple drive letters sharing a single physical device (optionally with different &quot;views&quot; of it) is not limited to the first floppy drive, but can be utilized for other drives as well by setting up additional block devices for them with the standard DOS DRIVER.SYS in CONFIG.SYS.

Network drives are often assigned letters towards the end of the alphabet. This is often done to differentiate them from local drives: by using letters towards the end, it reduces the risk of an assignment conflict. It is especially true when the assignment is done automatically across a network (usually by a logon script).

In most DOS systems, it is not possible to have more than 26 mounted drives. Atari GEMDOS supports 16 drive letters A: to P: only. The PalmDOS PCMCIA driver stack supports drive letters 0:, 1:, 2:, ... to address PCMCIA drive slots.

Some Novell network drivers for DOS support up to 32 drive letters under compatible DOS versions. In addition, Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01, and DR-DOS 7.02 genuinely support a CONFIG.SYS codice_5 directive in order to allocate up to 32 drive letters, named A: to Z:, [:, \:, ]:, ^:, _: and `:. (DR-DOS 7.02-7.07 also supports codice_6 and codice_7 directives in order to relocate drive structures into upper memory.) Some DOS application programs do not expect drive letters beyond Z: and will not work with them, therefore it is recommended to use them for special purposes or search drives.

JP Software&#x27;s 4DOS command line processor supports drive letters beyond Z: in general, but since some of the letters clash with syntactical extensions of this command line processor, they need to be escaped in order to use them as drive letters.

Windows 9x (MS-DOS 7.0/MS-DOS 7.1) added support for codice_8 and codice_9 as well.

If access to more filesystems than Z: is required under Windows NT, Volume Mount Points must be used. However, it is possible to mount non-letter drives, such as 1:, 2:, or !: using the command line codice_10 utility in Windows XP or later (i.e. codice_11), but it is not officially supported and may break programs that assume that all drives are letters A: to Z:.

==ASSIGN, JOIN and SUBST in DOS and Windows==
Drive letters are not the only way of accessing different volumes. DOS offers a JOIN command that allows access to an assigned volume through an arbitrary directory, similar to the Unix &quot;mount&quot; command. It also offers a SUBST command which allows the assignment of a drive letter to a directory. One or both of these commands were removed in later systems like OS/2 or Windows NT, but starting with Windows 2000, both are again supported: The SUBST command exists as before, while JOIN&#x27;s functionality is subsumed in LINKD (part of the Windows Resource Kit). In Windows Vista, the new command MKLINK can be used for this purpose. Also, Windows 2000 and later support mount points, accessible from the Control Panel.

Many operating systems originating from Digital Research provide means to implicitly assign substitute drives, called &quot;floating drives&quot; in DRI terminology, by using the CD/CHDIR command in the following syntax:

 CD N:=C:\SUBDIR

DOS Plus supports this for drive letters N:, O:, and P:. This feature is also present in Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager 7, and REAL/32, however, these systems extend the concept to all unused drive letters from A: to Z:, except for the reserved drive letter L:. DR DOS 3.31 - 6.0 (up to the 1992-11 updates with BDOS 6.7 only) also supports this including drive letter L:. This feature is not available under DR DOS 6.0 (1992 upgrade), PalmDOS 1.0, Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher. Floating drives are implemented in the BDOS kernel, not in the command line shell, thus they can be used and assigned also from within applications when they use the &quot;change directory&quot; system call. However, most DOS applications are not aware of this extension and will consequently discard such directory paths as invalid. JP Software&#x27;s command line interpreter 4DOS supports floating drives on operating systems also supporting it.

In a similar feature, Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32 will dynamically assign a drive letter L: to the load path of a loaded application, thereby allowing applications to refer to files residing in their load directory under a standardized drive letter instead of under an absolute path. This load drive feature makes it easier to move software installations on and across disks without having to adapt paths to overlays, configuration files or user data stored in the load directory or subsequent directories.
(For similar reasons, the appendage to the environment block associated with loaded applications under DOS 3.0 (and higher) contains a reference to the load path of the executable as well, however, this consumes more resident memory, and to take advantage of it, support for it must be coded into the executable, whereas DRI&#x27;s solution works with any kind of applications and is fully transparent to users as well.)
In some versions of DR-DOS, the load path contained in the appendage to the environment passed to drivers can be shortened to that of a temporary substitute drive (e.g. codice_12) through the codice_13/codice_14 option codice_15 (for codice_16 instead of, say, codice_17). This can be used to minimize a driver&#x27;s effective memory footprint, if the executable is located in a deep subdirectory and the resident driver happens to not need its load path after installation any more.

<doc id="55434" wikidata="Q260" url="?curid=55434" title="Jean-François Champollion">
<text>Jean-François Champollion (), also known as Champollion &quot;le jeune&quot; (&#x27;the Younger&#x27;; 23 December 1790 – 4 March 1832), was a French philologist and orientalist, known primarily as the decipherer of Egyptian hieroglyphs and a founding figure in the field of Egyptology. Partially raised by his brother, the scholar Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac, Champollion was a child prodigy in philology, giving his first public paper on the decipherment of Demotic in his late teens. As a young man he was renowned in scientific circles, and read Coptic, Ancient Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Arabic.

During the early 19th century, French culture experienced a period of &#x27;Egyptomania&#x27;, brought on by Napoleon&#x27;s discoveries in Egypt during his campaign there (1798–1801), which also brought to light the trilingual Rosetta Stone. Scholars debated the age of Egyptian civilization and the function and nature of the hieroglyphic script, which language if any it recorded, and the degree to which the signs were phonetic (representing speech sounds) or ideographic (recording semantic concepts directly). Many thought that the script was used only for sacred and ritual functions, and that as such it was unlikely to be decipherable since it was tied to esoteric and philosophical ideas, and did not record historical information. The significance of Champollion&#x27;s decipherment was that he showed these assumptions to be wrong, and made it possible to begin to retrieve many kinds of information recorded by the ancient Egyptians.

Champollion lived in a period of political turmoil in France, which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic Wars, he was able to avoid conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His own actions, sometimes brash and reckless, did not help his case. His relations with important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy, helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from the scientific community.

In 1820, Champollion embarked in earnest on the project of the decipherment of hieroglyphic script, soon overshadowing the achievements of British polymath Thomas Young, who had made the first advances in decipherment before 1819. In 1822, Champollion published his first breakthrough in the decipherment of the Rosetta hieroglyphs, showing that the Egyptian writing system was a combination of phonetic and ideographic signs – the first such script discovered. In 1824, he published a &quot;Précis&quot; in which he detailed a decipherment of the hieroglyphic script demonstrating the values of its phonetic and ideographic signs. In 1829, he travelled to Egypt where he was able to read many hieroglyphic texts that had never before been studied and brought home a large body of new drawings of hieroglyphic inscriptions. Home again, he was given a professorship in Egyptology but lectured only a few times before his health, ruined by the hardships of the Egyptian journey, forced him to give up teaching. He died in Paris in 1832, 41 years old. His grammar of Ancient Egyptian was published posthumously under the supervision of his brother.

During his life as well as long after his death, intense discussions over the merits of his decipherment were carried out among Egyptologists. Some faulted him for not having given sufficient credit to the early discoveries of Young, accusing him of plagiarism, and others long disputed the accuracy of his decipherments. However, subsequent findings and confirmations of his readings by scholars building on his results gradually led to the general acceptance of his work. Although some still argue that he should have acknowledged the contributions of Young, his decipherment is now universally accepted and has been the basis for all further developments in the field. Consequently, he is regarded as the &quot;Founder and Father of Egyptology&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Jean-François Champollion was born on 23 December 1790, the last of seven children (two of whom had died prior). He was raised in humble circumstances; his father Jacques Champollion was a book trader from Valjouffrey near Grenoble who had settled in the small town of Figeac in the Department of Lot. His father was a notorious drunk, and his mother, Jeanne-Françoise Gualieu, seems to have been largely an absent figure in the life of young Champollion, who was mostly raised by his older brother Jacques-Joseph. One biographer, Andrew Robinson, even speculated that Champollion was not in fact the son of Jacques Champollion&#x27;s wife but the result of an extramarital affair.

Towards the end of March 1801, Jean-François left Figeac for Grenoble, which he reached on 27 March, and where Jacques-Joseph lived in a two-room flat on the rue Neuve. Jacques-Joseph was then working as an assistant in the import-export company Chatel, Champollion and Rif, yet taught his brother to read, and supported his education. His brother also may have been part of the source of Champollion&#x27;s interest in Egypt, since as a young man he wanted to join Napoleon&#x27;s Egyptian expedition, and often regretted not being able to go.

Often known as the younger brother of better known Jacques-Joseph, Jean-François was often called Champollion &quot;le Jeune&quot; (the young). Later when his brother became the more famous of the two, Jacques added the town of his birth as a second surname and hence is often referred to as Champollion-Figeac, in contrast to his brother Champollion. Although studious and largely self-educated, Jacques did not have Jean-François&#x27; genius for language; however, he was talented at earning a living and supported Jean-François for most of his life.

Given the difficulty of the task of educating his brother while earning a living, Jacques-Joseph decided to send his younger brother to the well-regarded school of the Abbé Dussert in November 1802, where Champollion would stay until the summer of 1804. During this period, his gift for languages first became evident: he started out learning Latin and Greek, but quickly progressed to Hebrew and other Semitic languages such as Ethiopic, Arabic, Syriac and Chaldean. It was while a student here that he took up an interest in Ancient Egypt, likely encouraged in this direction by Dussert and his brother, both orientalists.

At the age of 11, he came to the attention of the prefect of Grenoble, Joseph Fourier, who had accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on the Egyptian expedition that had discovered the Rosetta Stone. An accomplished scholar in addition to a well-known mathematical physicist, Fourier had been entrusted by Napoleon with the publication of the results of the expedition in the monumental series of publications titled &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;. One biographer has stated that Fourier invited the 11-year-old Champollion to his home and showed him his collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts and documents. Champollion was enthralled, and upon seeing the hieroglyphs and hearing that they were unintelligible, he declared that he would be the one to succeed in reading them. Whether or not the report of this visit is true, Fourier did go on to become one of Champollion&#x27;s most important allies and supporters and surely had an important role in instilling his interest in Ancient Egypt.

From a young age, Champollion showed great interest in the Coptic language, rightly believing it to be the last stage of development of the ancient Egyptian language, and the key to deciphering the hieroglyphs. He frequented a Coptic priest living in Paris, called Youhanna Chiftichi, who taught him to read and speak Coptic fluently. In a letter written by Jean-François Champollion to his brother, Champollion wrote of Chiftichi stating:

:&quot;I am going to visit a Coptic priest at Saint-Roch, rue Saint-Honoré, who celebrates Mass [...] who will instruct me in Coptic names, and the pronunciation of Coptic letters. I am devoting myself entirely to the Coptic language, for I want to know the Egyptian language as well as my own native French. My great work on the Egyptian papyri will be based on this [ancient] tongue.&quot;

From 1804, Champollion studied at a &quot;lycée&quot; in Grenoble but hated its strict curriculum, which only allowed him to study oriental languages one day per week, and he begged his brother to move him to a different school. Nonetheless, at the &quot;lycée&quot; he took up the study of Coptic, which would become his main linguistic interest for years to come and prove crucial in his approach to decipherment of the hieroglyphs. He had a chance to practice his Coptic when he met Dom Raphaël de Monachis, a former Egyptian Christian monk of Syrian origin and Arabic translator to Napoleon, who visited Grenoble in 1805. By 1806, Jacques-Joseph was making preparations to bring his younger brother to Paris to study at the University. Jean-François had by then already developed a strong interest in Ancient Egypt, as he wrote in a letter to his parents dated January 1806:
&quot;I want to make a profound and continuous study of this ancient nation. The enthusiasm brought me by the study of their monuments, their power and knowledge filling me with admiration, all of this will grow further as I acquire new notions. Of all the people that I prefer, I shall say that none is as important to my heart as the Egyptians.&quot;
To continue his studies, Champollion wanted to go to Paris, Grenoble offering few possibilities for such specialized subjects as ancient languages. His brother thus stayed in Paris from August to September that same year, so as to seek his admission in a specialized school. Around this time, he learned Classical Chinese, Avestan, Middle Persian, and the Persian language. Before leaving however Champollion presented, on 1 September 1807, his &quot;Essay on the Geographical Description of Egypt before the Conquest of Cambyses&quot; before the Academy of Grenoble whose members were so impressed that they admitted him to the Academy six months later.

From 1807 to 1809, Champollion studied in Paris, under Silvestre de Sacy, the first Frenchman to attempt to read the Rosetta stone, and with orientalist Louis-Mathieu Langlès, and with Raphaël de Monachis who was now in Paris. Here he perfected his Arabic and Persian, in addition to the languages that he had already acquired. He was so immersed in his studies that he took up the habit of dressing in Arab clothing and calling himself &quot;Al Seghir&quot;, the Arab translation of &quot;le jeune&quot;. He divided his time between the College of France, the Special School of Oriental Languages, the National Library where his brother was a librarian and the Commission of Egypt, the institution in charge of publishing the findings of the Egyptian expedition. In 1808, he first began studying the Rosetta stone, working from a copy made by the Abbé de Tersan. Working independently he was able to confirm some of the readings of the demotic previously made by Johan David Åkerblad in 1802, finally identifying the Coptic equivalents of fifteen demotic signs present on the Rosetta stone.

In 1810, he returned to Grenoble to take up a seat as joint professor of Ancient History at the newly reopened Grenoble University. His salary as an assistant professor at Grenoble was fixed at 750 francs, a quarter of the salary received by full professors.

Never well off and struggling to make ends meet, he also suffered since youth from chronically bad health, including gout and tinnitus. His health first began to deteriorate during his time in Paris, where the dank climate and unsanitary environment did not agree with him.

=== Political trouble during the Napoleonic Wars ===

During the Napoleonic Wars, Champollion was a young bachelor and thus liable to compulsory military service, which would have put him in great danger due to the extremely high mortality of soldiers in Napoleon&#x27;s armies. Through the assistance of his brother and the prefect of Grenoble Joseph Fourier, who was also an Egyptologist, he successfully avoided the draft by arguing that his work on deciphering the Egyptian script was too important to interrupt. First sceptical of the Napoleonic regime, after the fall of Napoleon in 1813 and the institution of the royalist regime under Louis XVIII, Champollion came to consider the Napoleonic state the lesser of two evils. Anonymously he composed and circulated songs ridiculing and criticizing the royal regime – songs that became highly popular among the people of Grenoble. In 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte escaped from his exile on Elba and landed with an army at the Côte d&#x27;Azur and marched directly on Grenoble where he was received as a liberator. Here he met with Champollion, whose many requests for exemption from the draft he remembered, and he asked him how his important work was progressing. Champollion replied, that he had just finished his Coptic grammar and dictionary. Napoleon requested that he send the manuscripts to Paris for publication. His brother Jacques joined the Napoleonic cause, putting both of the brothers in danger at the end of the Hundred Days when Napoleon was finally defeated, Grenoble being the last city to resist the royalist advances. In spite of the risk to themselves, having been put under Royalist surveillance, the Champollion brothers nonetheless aided the Napoleonic general Drouet d&#x27;Erlon who had been sentenced to death for his participation in the Battle of Waterloo, giving him shelter and helping him escape to Munich. The brothers were condemned to internal exile in Figeac, Champollion was removed from his university post in Grenoble and the faculty closed.

Under the new Royalist regime, the Champollion brothers invested much of their time and efforts in establishing Lancaster schools, in an effort to provide the general population with education. This was considered a revolutionary undertaking by the Ultra-royalists, who did not believe that education should be made accessible for the lower classes. In 1821, Champollion even led an uprising, in which he and a band of Grenobleans stormed the citadel and hoisted the tricolore instead of the Bourbon Royalist flag. He was charged with treason and went into hiding but was eventually pardoned.

=== Family life ===

In 1807, Champollion first declared his love for Pauline Berriat, sister of Jacques-Joseph&#x27;s wife Zoé. His love was not reciprocated, so Champollion instead had an affair with a married woman named Louise Deschamps that lasted until around 1809. In 1811, Louise remarried; in 1813, Pauline died.

It was around this time that Champollion met Rosine Blanc (1794–1871), whom he married in 1818, after four years of engagement. They had one daughter, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (1824–1889). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first, her father did not approve of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation, he eventually agreed. Originally, Jacques-Joseph was opposed to his brother&#x27;s marriage, too, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister-in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away for months or even years at a time, as he was travelling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt, while his family remained in Zoé and Jacques-Joseph&#x27;s property in Vif, near Grenoble. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion&#x27;s work at a celebration in his honour, and the two exchanged letters over the period 1826–1829 revealing the poor state of Champollion&#x27;s marriage, yet an affair never developed.

== Deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphs ==
The Egyptian hieroglyphs had been well-known to scholars of the ancient world for centuries, but few had made any attempts to understand them. Many based their speculations about the script in the writings of Horapollon who considered the symbols to be ideographic, not representing any specific spoken language. Athanasius Kircher for example had stated that the hieroglyphs were symbols that &quot;cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures&quot;, meaning that the script was in essence impossible to ever decipher. Others considered that the use of hieroglyphs in Egyptian society was limited to the religious sphere and that they represented esoteric concepts within a universe of religious meaning that was now lost. But Kircher had been the first to suggest that modern Coptic was a degenerate form of the language found in the Egyptian demotic script, and he had correctly suggested the phonetic value of one hieroglyph – that of &quot;mu&quot;, the Coptic word for water. With the onset of Egyptomania in France in the early 19th century, scholars began approaching the question of the hieroglyphs with renewed interest, but still without a basic idea about whether the script was phonetic or ideographic, and whether the texts represented profane topics or sacred mysticism. This early work was mostly speculative, with no methodology for how to corroborate suggested readings. The first methodological advances were Joseph de Guignes&#x27; discovery that cartouches identified the names of rulers, and George Zoëga&#x27;s compilation of a catalogue of hieroglyphs, and the discovery that the direction of reading depended on the direction in which the glyphs were facing.

=== Early studies ===
Champollion&#x27;s interest in Egyptian history and the hieroglyphic script developed at an early age. At the age of 16, he gave a lecture before the Grenoble Academy in which he argued that the language spoken by the ancient Egyptians, in which they wrote the Hieroglyphic texts, was closely related to Coptic. This view proved crucial in becoming able to read the texts, and the correctness of his proposed relation between Coptic and Ancient Egyptian has been confirmed by history. This enabled him to propose that the demotic script represented the Coptic language.

Already in 1806, he wrote to his brother about his decision to become the one to decipher the Egyptian script:
In 1808, Champollion received a scare when French archaeologist Alexandre Lenoir published the first of his four volumes on &quot;Nouvelles Explications des Hieroglyphes&quot;, making the young scholar fear that his budding work had already been surpassed. But he was relieved to find that Lenoir still operated under the assumption that the hieroglyphs were mystic symbols and not a literary system expressing language. This experience made him even more determined to be the first to decipher the language and he began dedicating himself even more to the study of Coptic, writing in 1809 to his brother: &quot;I give myself up entirely to Coptic ... I wish to know Egyptian like my French, because on that language will be based my great work on the Egyptian papyri.&quot; That same year, he was appointed to his first academic post, in history and politics at the University of Grenoble.

In 1811, Champollion was embroiled in controversy, as Étienne Marc Quatremère, like Champollion a student of Silvestre de Sacy, published his &quot;Mémoires géographiques et historiques sur l&#x27;Égypte ... sur quelques contrées voisines&quot;. Champollion saw himself forced to publish as a stand-alone paper the &quot;Introduction&quot; to his work in progress &quot;L&#x27;Egypte sous les pharaons ou recherches sur la géographie, la langue, les écritures et l&#x27;histoire de l&#x27;Egypte avant l&#x27;invasion de Cambyse&quot; (1814). Because of the similarities in the topic matter, and the fact that Champollion&#x27;s work was published after Quatremère&#x27;s, allegations arose that Champollion had plagiarized the work of Quatremère. Even Silvestre de Sacy, the mentor of both authors, considered the possibility, to Champollion&#x27;s great chagrin.

=== Rivalry with Thomas Young ===
British polymath Thomas Young was one of the first to attempt decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, basing his own work on the investigations of Swedish diplomat Johan David Åkerblad. Young and Champollion first became aware of each other&#x27;s work in 1814 when Champollion wrote to the Royal Society of which Young was the secretary, requesting better transcriptions of the Rosetta stone, to Young&#x27;s irritation, arrogantly implying that he would be able to quickly decipher the script if he only had better copies. Young had at that time spent several months working unsuccessfully on the Rosetta text using Åkerblad&#x27;s decipherments. In 1815, Young replied in the negative, arguing that the French transcriptions were equally good as the British ones, and added: &quot;I do not doubt that the collective efforts of savants, such as M. Åkerblad and yourself, Monsieur, who have so much deepened the study of the Coptic language, might have already succeeded in giving a more perfect translation than my own, which is drawn almost entirely from a very laborious comparison of its different parts and with the Greek translation.&quot; This was the first Champollion had heard of Young&#x27;s research, and realizing that he also had a competitor in London was not to Champollion&#x27;s liking.

In his work on the Rosetta stone, Young proceeded mathematically without identifying the language of the text. For example, comparing the number of times a word appeared in the Greek text with the Egyptian text, he was able to point out which glyphs spelt the word &quot;king&quot;, but he was unable to read the word. Using Åkerblad&#x27;s decipherment of the demotic letters &quot;p&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, he realized that there were phonetic elements in the writing of the name Ptolemy. He correctly read the signs for &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;s&quot;, but rejected several other signs as &quot;inessential&quot; and misread others, due to the lack of a systematic approach. Young called the Demotic script &quot;&quot;enchorial&quot;, and resented Champollion&#x27;s term &quot;demotic&quot; considering it bad form that he had invented a new name for it instead of using Young&#x27;s. Young corresponded with Sacy, now no longer Champollion&#x27;s mentor but his rival, who advised Young not to share his work with Champollion and described Champollion as a charlatan. Consequently, for several years Young kept key texts from Champollion and shared little of his data and notes.

When Champollion submitted his Coptic grammar and dictionary for publication in 1815, it was blocked by Silvestre de Sacy, who in addition to his personal animosity and envy towards Champollion also resented his Napoleonic affinities. During his exile in Figeac, Champollion spent his time revising the grammar and doing local archaeological work, being for a time cut off from being able to continue his research.

In 1817, Champollion read a review of his &quot;Égypte sous les pharaons&quot;&quot;, published by an anonymous Englishman, which was largely favourable and encouraged Champollion to return to his former research. Champollion&#x27;s biographers have suggested that the review was written by Young, who often published anonymously, but Robinson, who wrote biographies of both Young and Champollion, considers it unlikely since Young elsewhere had been highly critical of that particular work. Soon Champollion returned to Grenoble to seek employment again at the university, which was in the process of reopening the faculty of Philosophy and Letters. He succeeded, obtaining a chair in history and geography, and used his time to visit the Egyptian collections in Italian museums. Nonetheless, most of his time in the following years was consumed by his teaching work.

Meanwhile, Young kept working on the Rosetta stone, and in 1819, he published a major article on &quot;Egypt&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; claiming that he had discovered the principle behind the script. He had correctly identified only a small number of phonetic values for glyphs but also made some eighty approximations of correspondences between Hieroglyphic and demotic. Young had also correctly identified several logographs, and the grammatical principle of pluralization, distinguishing correctly between the singular, dual and plural forms of nouns. Young nonetheless considered the hieroglyphic, linear or cursive hieroglyphs (which he called hieratic) and a third script that he called epistolographic or enchorial, to belong to different historical periods and to represent different evolutionary stages of the script with increasing phoneticism. He failed to distinguish between hieratic and demotic, considering them a single script. Young was also able to identify correctly the hieroglyphic form of the name of Ptolemy V, whose name had been identified by Åkerblad in the demotic script only. Nonetheless, he assigned the correct phonetic values to only some of the signs in the name, incorrectly dismissing one glyph, the one for &quot;o&quot;, as unnecessary, and assigning partially correct values to the signs for &quot;m&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, and &quot;s&quot;. He also read the name of Berenice, but he managed to correctly identify only the letter &quot;n&quot;. Young was furthermore convinced that only in the late period had some foreign names been written entirely in phonetic signs, whereas he believed that native Egyptian names and all texts from the earlier period were written in ideographic signs. Several scholars have suggested that Young&#x27;s true contribution to Egyptology was his decipherment of the Demotic script, in which he made the first major advances, correctly identifying it as being composed of both ideographic and phonetic signs. Nevertheless, for some reason Young never considered that the same might be the case with the hieroglyphs.

Later, the British Egyptologist Sir Peter Le Page Renouf summed up Young&#x27;s method: &quot;He worked mechanically, like the schoolboy who finding in a translation that &quot;Arma virumque&quot; means &#x27;Arms and the man,&#x27; reads &quot;Arma&quot; &#x27;arms,&#x27; &quot;virum&quot; &#x27;and&#x27; , &quot;que&quot; &#x27;the man.&#x27; He is sometimes right, but very much oftener wrong, and no one is able to distinguish between his right and his wrong results until the right method has been discovered.&quot; Nonetheless, at the time it was clear that Young&#x27;s work superseded everything Champollion had by then published on the script.

=== Breakthrough ===
Although dismissive of Young&#x27;s work even before he had read it, Champollion obtained a copy of the Encyclopedia article. Even though he was suffering from failing health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest to the study of the hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the time to work on it exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, &quot;De l&#x27;écriture hiératique des anciens Égyptiens&quot;, in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition, Champollion made the fatal error of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely ideographic. Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.

These errors were finally corrected later that year when Champollion correctly identified the hieratic script as being based on the hieroglyphic script, but used exclusively on papyrus, whereas the hieroglyphic script was used on stone, and demotic used by the people. Previously, it had been questioned whether the three scripts even represented the same language; and hieroglyphic had been considered a purely ideographic script, whereas hieratic and demotic were considered alphabetic. Young, in 1815, had been the first to suggest that the demotic was not alphabetic, but rather a mixture of &quot;imitations of hieroglyphics&quot; and &quot;alphabetic&quot; signs. Champollion, in contrast, correctly considered the scripts to coincide almost entirely, being in essence different formal versions of the same script.

In the same year, he identified the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being written in a mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being a much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.

==== Names of rulers ====
Using the fact that it was known that the names of rulers appeared in cartouches, he focused on reading the names of rulers as Young had initially tried. Champollion managed to isolate a number of sound values for signs, by comparing the Greek and Hieroglyphic versions of the names of Ptolemy and Cleopatra – correcting Young&#x27;s readings in several instances.

In 1822 Champollion received transcriptions of the text on the recently discovered Philae obelisk, which enabled him to double-check his readings of the names Ptolemy and Cleopatra from the Rosetta stone. The name &quot;Cleopatra&quot; had already been identified on the Philae obelisk by William John Bankes, who scribbled the identification in the margin of the plate though without any actual reading of the individual glyphs. Young and others would later use the fact that the Cleopatra cartouche had been identified by Bankes to claim that Champollion had plagiarized his work. It remains unknown whether Champollion saw Bankes&#x27; margin note identifying the cartouche or whether he identified it by himself. All in all, using this method he managed to determine the phonetic value of 12 signs (A, AI, E, K, L, M, O, P, R, S, and T). By applying these to the decipherment of further sounds he soon read dozens of other names.

Astronomer Jean-Baptiste Biot published a proposed decipherment of the controversial Dendera zodiac, arguing that the small stars following certain signs referred to constellations. Champollion published a response in the &quot;Revue encyclopédique&quot;, demonstrating that they were in fact grammatical signs, which he called &quot;signs of the type&quot;, today called &quot;determinatives&quot;. Young had identified the first determinative &quot;divine female&quot;, but Champollion now identified several others. He presented the progress before the academy where it was well received, and even his former mentor-turned-archenemy, de Sacy, praised it warmly, leading to a reconciliation between the two.

The main breakthrough in his decipherment was when he was also able to read the verb &quot;MIS&quot; related to birth, by comparing the Coptic verb for birth with the phonetic signs &quot;MS&quot; and the appearance of references to birthday celebrations in the Greek text. It was on 14 September 1822, while comparing his readings to a set of new texts from Abu Simbel, that he made the realization. Running down the street to find his brother, he yelled &quot;Je tiens mon affaire!&quot; (I&#x27;ve got it!) but collapsed from the excitement. Champollion subsequently spent the short period from 14 to 22 September writing up his results.

While the name Thutmose had also been identified (but not read) by Young, who realized that the first syllable was spelt with a depiction of an ibis representing Thoth, Champollion was able to read the phonetic spelling of the second part of the word and check it against the mentioning of births in the Rosetta stone. This finally confirmed to Champollion that the ancient texts as well as the recent ones used the same writing system and that it was a system that mixed logographic and phonetic principles.

==== Letter to Dacier ====
A week later on 27 September 1822, he published some of his findings in his &quot;Lettre à M. Dacier&quot;, addressed to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Paris &quot;Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres&quot;. The handwritten letter was originally addressed to De Sacy, but Champollion crossed out the letter of his mentor turned adversary, substituting the name of Dacier, who had faithfully supported his efforts. Champollion read the letter before the assembled &quot;Académie&quot;. All his main rivals and supporters were present at the reading, including Young who happened to be visiting Paris. This was the first meeting between the two. The presentation did not go into details regarding the script and in fact, was surprisingly cautious in its suggestions. Although he must have been already certain of this, Champollion merely suggested that the script was already phonetic from the earliest available texts, which would mean that the Egyptians had developed writing independently of the other civilizations around the Mediterranean. The paper also still contained confusions regarding the relative role of ideographic and phonetic signs, still arguing that also hieratic and demotic were primarily ideographic.

Scholars have speculated that there had simply not been sufficient time between his breakthrough and collapse to fully incorporate the discovery into his thinking. But the paper presented many new phonetic readings of names of rulers, demonstrating clearly that he had made a major advance in deciphering the phonetic script. And it finally settled the question of the dating of the Dendera zodiac, by reading the cartouche that had been erroneously read as &quot;Arsinoë&quot; by Young, in its correct reading &quot;autocrator&quot; (Emperor in Greek).

He was congratulated by the amazed audience including de Sacy and Young. Young and Champollion became acquainted over the next days, Champollion sharing many of his notes with Young and inviting him to visit at his house, and the two parted on friendly terms.

=== Reactions to the decipherment ===
At first, Young was appreciative of Champollion&#x27;s success, writing in a letter to his friend that &quot;If he [Champollion] did borrow an English key, the lock was so dreadfully rusty that no common arm would have had strength enough to turn it. ... .You will easily believe that were I ever so much the victim of the bad passions, I should feel nothing but exultation at Mr. Champollion&#x27;s success: my life seems indeed to be lengthened by the accession of a junior coadjutor in my researches, and of a person too, who is so much more versed in the different dialects of the Egyptian language than myself.&quot;

Nonetheless, the relationship between them quickly deteriorated, as Young began to feel that he was being denied due credit for his own &quot;first steps&quot; in the decipherment. Also, because of the tense political climate between England and France in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, there was little inclination to accept Champollion&#x27;s decipherments as valid among the English. When Young later read the published copy of the &quot;lettre&quot; he was offended that he himself was mentioned only twice, and one of those times being harshly critiqued for his failure in deciphering the name &quot;Berenice&quot;. Young was further disheartened because Champollion at no point recognized his work as having provided the platform from which decipherment had finally been reached. He grew increasingly angry with Champollion and shared his feelings with his friends who encouraged him to rebut with a new publication. When by a stroke of luck a Greek translation of a well-known demotic papyrus came into his possession later that year, he did not share that important finding with Champollion. In an anonymous review of the &quot;lettre&quot;, Young attributed the discovery of the hieratic as a form of hieroglyphs to de Sacy and described Champollion&#x27;s decipherments merely as an extension of Åkerblad and Young&#x27;s work. Champollion recognized that Young was the author, and sent him a rebuttal of the review while maintaining the charade of the anonymous review. Furthermore, Young, in his 1823 &quot;An Account of Some Recent Discoveries in Hieroglyphical Literature and Egyptian Antiquities, including the author&#x27;s original alphabet, as extended by Mr. Champollion&quot;, he complained that &quot;however Mr Champollion may have arrived at his conclusions, I admit them, with the greatest pleasure and gratitude, not by any means as superseding my system, but as fully confirming and extending it.&quot;(p. 146).

In France, Champollion&#x27;s success also produced enemies. Edmé-Francois Jomard was chief among them, and he spared no occasion to belittle Champollion&#x27;s achievements behind his back, pointing out that Champollion had never been to Egypt and suggesting that really his &quot;lettre&quot; represented no major progress from Young&#x27;s work. Jomard had been insulted by Champollion&#x27;s demonstration of the young age of the Dendera zodiac, which he had himself proposed was as old as 15,000 years. This exact finding had also brought Champollion in the good graces of many priests of the Catholic Church who had been antagonized by the claims that Egyptian civilization might be older than their accepted chronology, according to which the earth was only 6,000 years old.

=== &quot;Précis&quot; ===
Young&#x27;s claims that the new decipherments were merely a corroboration of his own method, meant that Champollion would have to publish more of his data to make clear the degree to which his own progress built on a systematicity that was not found in Young&#x27;s work. He realized that he would have to make it apparent to all that his was a total system of decipherment, whereas Young had merely deciphered a few words. Over the next year, he published a series of booklets about the Egyptian gods, including some decipherments of their names.

Building on his progress, Champollion now began to study other texts in addition to the Rosetta stone, studying a series of much older inscriptions from Abu Simbel. During 1822, he succeeded in identifying the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches in these ancient texts. With the help of a new acquaintance, the Duke de Blacas in 1824, Champollion finally published the &quot;Précis du système hiéroglyphique des anciens Égyptiens&quot; dedicated to and funded by King Louis XVIII. Here he presented the first correct translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the Egyptian grammatical system.

In the &quot;Précis&quot;, Champollion referred to Young&#x27;s 1819 claim of having deciphered the script when he wrote that:

This task was exactly what Champollion set out to accomplish in the Précis, and the entire framing of the argument was as a rebuttal to &quot;M. le docteur Young&quot; and the translation in his 1819 article, which Champollion brushed off as &quot;a conjectural translation&quot;.

In the introduction, Champollion described his argument in points:
# That his &quot;alphabet&quot; (in the sense of phonetic readings) could be employed to read inscriptions from all of the periods of Egyptian history.
# That the discovery of the phonetic alphabet is the true key to understanding the entire hieroglyphic system.
# That the ancient Egyptians used the system in all of the periods of Egyptian history to represent the sounds of their spoken language phonetically.
# That all of the hieroglyphic texts are composed almost entirely of the phonetic signs that he had discovered.

Champollion never admitted any debt to Young&#x27;s work, although in 1828, a year before his death, Young was appointed to the French Academy of Sciences, with Champollion&#x27;s support.

The &quot;Précis&quot;, which comprised more than 450 ancient Egyptian words and hieroglyphics groupings, cemented Champollion as having the main claim to the decipherment of the hieroglyphs. In 1825, his former teacher and enemy Silvestre de Sacy reviewed his work positively stating that it was already well &quot;beyond the need for confirmation&quot;. In the same year, Henry Salt put Champollion&#x27;s decipherment to the test, successfully using it to read further inscriptions. He published a corroboration of Champollion&#x27;s system, in which he also criticized Champollion for not acknowledging his dependence on Young&#x27;s work.

With his work on the &quot;Précis&quot;, Champollion realized that in order to advance further he needed more texts, and transcriptions of better quality. This caused him to spend the next years visiting collections and monuments in Italy, where he realized that many of the transcriptions from which he had been working had been inaccurate – hindering the decipherment; he made a point of making his own copies of as many texts as possible. During his time in Italy, he met the Pope, who congratulated him on having done a &quot;great service to the Church&quot;, by which he was referring to the counterarguments he had provided against the challengers to the Biblical chronology. Champollion was ambivalent, but the Pope&#x27;s support helped him in his efforts to secure funds for an expedition.

== Contribution to the decipherment of cuneiform ==
The deciphering of the cuneiform script started with the first efforts at understanding Old Persian cuneiform in 1802, when Friedrich Münter realized that recurring groups of characters in Old Persian inscriptions must be the Old Persian word for &quot;king&quot; (, now known to be pronounced &quot;xšāyaθiya&quot;). Georg Friedrich Grotefend extended this work by realizing a king&#x27;s name is often followed by &quot;great king, king of kings&quot; and the name of the king&#x27;s father. Through deductions, Grotefend was able to figure out the cuneiform characters that are part of Darius, Darius&#x27;s father Hystaspes, and Darius&#x27;s son Xerxes. Grotefend&#x27;s contribution to Old Persian is unique in that he did not have comparisons between Old Persian and known languages, as opposed to the decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphics and the Rosetta Stone. All his decipherments were done by comparing the texts with known history. Grotefend presented his deductions in 1802, but they were dismissed by the Academic community.
It was only in 1823 that Grotefend&#x27;s discovery was confirmed, when Champollion, who had just deciphered hieroglyphs, had the idea of trying to decrypt the quadrilingual hieroglyph-cuneiform inscription on a famous alabaster vase in the Cabinet des Médailles, the Caylus vase. The Egyptian inscription on the vase turned out to be in the name of King Xerxes I, and the orientalist Antoine-Jean Saint-Martin, who accompanied Champollion, was able to confirm that the corresponding words in the cuneiform script (, &quot;Xšayāršā : XŠ : vazraka&quot;, &quot;Xerxes : The Great King&quot;) were indeed the words that Grotefend had identified as meaning &quot;king&quot; and &quot;Xerxes&quot; through guesswork. This was the first time the hypotheses of Grotefend could be vindicated. In effect, the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs was decisive in confirming the first steps of the decipherment of the cuneiform script.

More advances were made in Grotefend&#x27;s work and by 1847, most of the symbols were correctly identified. The decipherment of the Old Persian Cuneiform script was at the beginning of the decipherment of all the other cuneiform scripts, as various multi-lingual inscriptions between the various cuneiform scripts were obtained from archaeological discoveries. The decipherment of Old Persian, the first cuneiform script to be deciphered, was then notably instrumental to the decipherment of Elamite and Babylonian thanks to the trilingual Behistun inscription, which ultimately led to the decipherment of Akkadian (predecessor of Babylonian) and then Sumerian, through the discovery of ancient Akkadian-Sumerian dictionaries.

=== Confirmation of the antiquity of phonetical hieroglyphs ===
Champollion had been confronted to the doubts of various scholars regarding the existence of phonetical hieroglyphs before the time of the Greeks and the Romans in Egypt, especially since Champollion had only proved his phonetic system on the basis of the names of Greek and Roman rulers found in hieroglyphs on Egyptian monuments. Until his decipherment of the Caylus vase, he had not found any foreign names earlier than Alexander the Great that were transliterated through alphabetic hieroglyphs, which led to suspicions that they were invented at the time of the Greeks and Romans, and fostered doubts whether phonetical hieroglyphs could be applied to decipher the names of ancient Egyptian Pharaohs. For the first time, here was a foreign name (&quot;Xerxes the Great&quot;) transcribed phonetically with Egyptian hieroglyphs, already 150 years before Alexander the Great, thereby essentially proving Champollion&#x27;s thesis. In his &quot;Précis du système hiéroglyphique&quot; published in 1824, Champollion wrote of this discovery: &quot;It has thus been proved that Egyptian hieroglyphs included phonetic signs, at least since 460 BC&quot;.

== Curator of the Egyptian Antiquities in the Louvre ==

After his groundbreaking discoveries in 1822, Champollion made the acquaintance of Pierre Louis Jean Casimir Duc de Blacas, an antiquary who became his patron and managed to gain him the favour of the king. Thanks to this, in 1824, he travelled to Turin to inspect a collection of Egyptian materials assembled by Bernardino Drovetti, which King Charles X had purchased, cataloguing it. In Turin and Rome, he realized the necessity of seeing Egyptian monuments first-hand and began to make plans for an expedition to Egypt while collaborating with Tuscan scholars and the Archduke Leopold. In 1824, he became a correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

Following his successes and after several months of negotiations and talks by Jacques-Joseph while he was still in Italy, Champollion was finally appointed curator of the Egyptian collections of the Musée du Louvre in a decree of Charles X dated to 15 May 1826. The two Champollion brothers organised the Egyptian collection in four rooms on the first floor of the south side of the Cour Carrée. The visitors entered this section of the Louvre via a first room devoted to the funerary world of the Egyptians, the second room presented artefacts relating to civilian life in Ancient Egypt, while the third and fourth rooms were devoted to more artefacts pertaining to mortuary activities and divinities. To accompany these extensive works, Champollion organised the Egyptian collection methodologically into well-defined series and pushed his work to the point of choosing the appearance of the stands and pedestals.

Champollion&#x27;s work in the Louvre, as well as his and his brother&#x27;s efforts to acquire a larger collection of Egyptian artefacts, had a profound impact on the Louvre museum itself, the nature of which changed the Louvre from a place dedicated to the fine-arts – to a museum in the modern sense of the term, with important galleries devoted to the history of various civilisations.

== Franco-Tuscan Expedition ==

In 1827, Ippolito Rosellini, who had first met Champollion during his 1826 stay in Florence, went to Paris for a year in order to improve his knowledge of the method of Champollion&#x27;s system of decipherment. The two philologists decided to organize an expedition to Egypt to confirm the validity of the discovery. Headed by Champollion and assisted by Rosellini, his first disciple and great friend, the mission was known as the Franco-Tuscan Expedition and was made possible by the support of the grand-duke of Tuscany, Leopold II, and Charles X. Champollion and his second-in-command Rossellini were joined on the expedition by Charles Lenormant, representing the French government, and a team of eleven Frenchmen including the Egyptologist and artist Nestor L&#x27;Hote and Italians including the artist Giuseppe Angelelli.

In preparation for the expedition, Champollion wrote the French Consul General Bernardino Drovetti for advice on how to secure permission from the Egyptian Khedive and Ottoman Viceroy Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Drovetti had initiated his own business of exporting plundered Egyptian antiques and did not want Champollion meddling in his affairs. He sent a letter discouraging the expedition stating that the political situation was too unstable for the expedition to be advisable. The letter reached Jacques Joseph Champollion a few weeks before the expedition was scheduled to leave, but he conveniently delayed in sending it on to his brother until after the expedition had left.

On 21 July 1828, the expedition boarded the ship &quot;Eglé&quot; at Toulon and set sail for Egypt and on 18 August they arrived in Alexandria. Here, Champollion met with Drovetti, who continued to warn about the political situation but assured Champollion that the Pasha would give his permission for the expedition to proceed. Champollion, Rosselini and Lenormant met with the Pasha on 24 August, and he immediately gave his permission. However, after more than a week of waiting for the permissions, Champollion suspected that Drovetti was working against him and took a complaint to the French consulate. The complaint worked and soon the pasha provided the expedition with a large riverboat. The expedition bought a small boat for five persons. Champollion named them the &quot;Isis&quot; and the &quot;Athyr&quot; after Egyptian goddesses. On 19 September, they arrived in Cairo, where they stayed until 1 October when they left for the desert sites of Memphis, Saqqara and Giza.

While examining texts in the tombs at Saqqara in October, Champollion realized that the hieroglyphic word for &quot;hour&quot; included the hieroglyph representing a star, which served no phonetic function in the word. He wrote in his journal that the star-glyph was &quot;the &quot;determinative&quot; of all divisions of time&quot;. Champollion probably coined this term, replacing his phrase &quot;signs of the type&quot;, while in Egypt, as it had not appeared in the 1828 edition of the &quot;Précis&quot;. Champollion also saw the sphinx and lamented that the inscription on its chest was covered by more sand than they would be able to remove in a week. Arriving in Dendera on 16 November, Champollion was excited to see the Zodiac that he had deciphered in Paris. Here, he realized that the glyph that he had deciphered as &quot;autocrator&quot; and which convinced him that the inscription was of recent date was in fact not found on the monument itself – it had seemingly been invented by Jomard&#x27;s copyist. Champollion nonetheless realized that the late date was still correct, based on other evidence. After a day at Dendera, the expedition continued on to Thebes.

Champollion was particularly captured by the array of important monuments and inscriptions at Thebes and decided to spend as much time there as possible on the way back north. South of Thebes, the &quot;Isis&quot; sprang a leak and nearly sank. Having lost many provisions and spent several days repairing the boat they continued south to Aswan where the boats had to be left, since they could not make it across the first Cataract. They travelled by small boats and camelback to Elephantine and Philae. At Philae, Champollion spent several days recovering from an attack of gout brought on by the hard trip, and he also received letters from his wife and brother, both sent many months earlier. Champollion attributed their delay to Drovetti&#x27;s ill will. They arrived at Abu Simbel on 26 November, the site had been visited by Bankes and Belzoni in 1815 and 1817 respectively, but the sand that they had cleared from the entrance had now returned. On 1 January 1829, they reached Wadi Halfa and returned north. That day, Champollion composed a letter to M. Dacier stating: &quot;I am proud now, having followed the course of the Nile from its mouth to the second cataract, to have the right to announce to you that there is nothing to modify in our &#x27;Letter on the Alphabet of the Hieroglyphs.&#x27; Our Alphabet is good.&quot;

Even though Champollion was appalled by the rampant looting of ancient artefacts and destruction of monuments, the expedition also contributed to the destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05 m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha, he recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled. Champollion&#x27;s suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali&#x27;s 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction of a museum in which to house the ancient artefacts.

On the way back, they stayed again at Thebes from March to September, making many new drawings and paintings of the monuments there. Here, at the Valley of the Kings the expedition moved into the tomb of Ramesses IV (of the 20th Dynasty). They also located the tomb of Ramesses the Great, but it was badly looted. It was here that Champollion first received news of Young&#x27;s campaign to vindicate himself as the decipherer of the hieroglyphs and to discredit Champollion&#x27;s decipherments. He received this news only a few days after Young&#x27;s death in London.

In late September 1829, the expedition arrived back in Cairo, where they bought 10,000 francs worth of antiquities, a budget extended to them by minister Rochefoucauld. Arriving in Alexandria, they were notified that the French boat that would take them back was delayed, and they had to stay two months until 6 December. On their return to Alexandria, the Khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha, offered the two obelisks standing at the entrance of Luxor Temple to France in 1829, but only one was transported to Paris, where it now stands on the Place de la Concorde. Champollion and the Pasha spoke often and on the Pasha&#x27;s request, Champollion wrote an outline of the history of Egypt. Here, Champollion had no choice but to challenge the short Biblical chronology arguing that Egyptian civilization had its origins at least 6000 years before Islam. The two also spoke about social reforms, Champollion championing the education of the lower classes – a point on which the two did not agree.

Returning to Marseille on the Côte d&#x27;Azur, the members of the expedition had to spend a month in quarantine on the ship before being able to continue on towards Paris. The expedition led to a posthumously published extensive &quot;Monuments de l&#x27;Égypte et de la Nubie&quot; (1845).

== Death ==
After his return from the second expedition to Egypt, Champollion was appointed to the chair of Egyptian history and archaeology at the Collège de France, a chair that had been specially created for him by a decree of Louis Philippe I dated to 12 March 1831.
Champollion gave only three lectures before his illness forced him to give up teaching.
Exhausted by his labours during and after his scientific expedition to Egypt, Champollion died of an apoplectic attack (stroke) in Paris on 4 March 1832 at the age of 41. His body was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. On his tomb is a simple obelisk erected by his wife, and a stone slab stating: &quot;Ici repose Jean-François Champollion, né à Figeac dept. du Lot le 23 décembre 1790, décédé à Paris le 4 mars 1832&quot; (Here rests Jean-François Champollion, born at Figeac, Department of the Lot, on 23 December 1790, died at Paris on 4 March 1832).

Certain portions of Champollion&#x27;s works were edited by Jacques and published posthumously. His &quot;Grammar and Dictionary of Ancient Egyptian&quot; had been left almost finished and was published posthumously in 1838. Before his death, he had told his brother: &quot;Hold it carefully, I hope that it will be my calling card for posterity.&quot; It contained his entire theory and method, including classifications of signs and their decipherments, and also a grammar including how to decline nouns and conjugate verbs. But it was marred by the still tentative nature of many readings, and Champollion&#x27;s conviction that the hieroglyphs could be read directly in Coptic, whereas in fact, they represented a much older stage of the language, which differs in many ways from Coptic.

Jacques&#x27;s son, Aimé-Louis (1812–1894), wrote a biography of the two brothers, and he and his sister Zoë Champollion were both interviewed by Hermine Hartleben, whose major biography of Champollion was published in 1906.

Champollion&#x27;s decipherment remained controversial even after his death. The brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt famously championed his decipherment, as did Silvestre de Sacy, but others, such as Gustav Seyffarth, Julius Klaproth and Edmé-François Jomard sided with Young and refused to consider Champollion to be more than a talented imitator of Young even after the posthumous publication of his grammar. In England, Sir George Lewis still maintained 40 years after the decipherment, that since the Egyptian language was extinct, it was &quot;a priori&quot; impossible to decipher the hieroglyphs. In a reply to Lewis&#x27;s scathing critique, Reginald Poole, an Egyptologist, defended Champollion&#x27;s method, describing it as &quot;the method of interpreting Hieroglyphics originated by Dr. Young and developed by Champollion&quot;. Also Sir Peter Le Page Renouf defended Champollion&#x27;s method, although he was less deferential to Young.

Building on Champollion&#x27;s grammar, his student Karl Richard Lepsius continued to develop the decipherment, realizing in contrast to Champollion that vowels were not written. Lepsius became the most important champion of Champollion&#x27;s work. In 1866, the Decree of Canopus, discovered by Lepsius, was successfully deciphered using Champollion&#x27;s method, cementing his reputation as the true decipherer of the hieroglyphs.

== Legacy ==
Champollion&#x27;s most immediate legacy is in the field of Egyptology, of which he is now widely considered as the founder and father, with his decipherment the result of his genius combined with hard work.

Figeac honours him with La place des Écritures, a monumental reproduction of the Rosetta Stone by American artist Joseph Kosuth (pictured to the right). And a museum devoted to Jean-François Champollion was created in his birthplace at Figeac in Lot. It was inaugurated on 19 December 1986 in the presence of President François Mitterrand and Jean Leclant, Permanent Secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions and Letters. After two years of building work and extension, the museum re-opened in 2007. Besides Champollion&#x27;s life and discoveries, the museum also recounts the history of writing. The whole façade is covered in pictograms, from the original ideograms of the whole world.

In Vif near Grenoble, The Champollion Museum is located at the former abode of Jean-François&#x27;s brother.

Champollion has also been portrayed in many films and documentaries: For example, he was portrayed by Elliot Cowan in the 2005 BBC docudrama &quot;Egypt&quot;. His life and process of the decipherment of hieroglyphics were narrated by Françoise Fabian and Jean-Hugues Anglade in the 2000 Arte documentary film &quot;&quot;. In David Baldacci&#x27;s thriller involving the CIA, &quot;Simple Genius&quot;, the character named &quot;Champ Pollion&quot; was derived from Champollion.

In Cairo, a street carries his name, leading to the Tahrir Square where the Egyptian Museum is located.

Also named after him is the Champollion crater, a lunar crater on the far side of the Moon.

<text>Wuthering Heights is the only novel by the English author Emily Brontë, initially published in 1847 under her pen name &quot;Ellis Bell&quot;. It concerns two families of the landed gentry living on the West Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, and their turbulent relationships with the Earnshaws&#x27; foster son, Heathcliff. The novel, influenced by Romanticism and Gothic fiction, is considered a classic of English literature.

&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was accepted by publisher Thomas Newby along with Anne Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; before the success of their sister Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, but they were published later. After Emily&#x27;s death, Charlotte edited a second edition of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, which was published in 1850.

&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is now widely considered to be one of the greatest novels ever written in English, but contemporaneous reviews were polarised. It was controversial for its depictions of mental and physical cruelty, including domestic abuse, and for its challenges to Victorian morality, religion, and the class system. It has inspired an array of adaptations across several media, including English singer-songwriter Kate Bush&#x27;s song of the same name.

==Plot==

===Opening===
In 1801, Mr Lockwood, the new tenant at Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire, pays a visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, at his remote moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There he meets a reserved young woman (later identified as Cathy Linton), Joseph, a cantankerous servant, and Hareton, an uneducated young man who speaks like a servant. Everyone is sullen and inhospitable. Snowed in for the night, Lockwood reads the diary of the former inhabitant of his room, Catherine Earnshaw, and has a nightmare in which a ghostly Catherine begs to enter through the window. Awakened by Lockwood&#x27;s fearful yells, Heathcliff is troubled.

Lockwood later returns to Thrushcross Grange in heavy snow, falls ill from the cold and becomes bedridden. While he recovers, Lockwood&#x27;s housekeeper Ellen &quot;Nelly&quot; Dean tells him the story of the strange family.

=== Nelly&#x27;s tale ===
Thirty years earlier, the Earnshaws live at Wuthering Heights with their two children, Hindley and Catherine, and a servant—Nelly herself. Returning from a trip to Liverpool, Earnshaw brings home an orphan whom he names Heathcliff. Heathcliff&#x27;s origins are unclear but he is described as &quot;like a gipsy&quot; and possibly, a Lascar or an American or Spanish castaway. Earnshaw treats the boy as his favourite. His own children he neglects, especially after his wife dies. Hindley beats Heathcliff, who gradually becomes close friends with Catherine.

Hindley departs for university, returning as the new master of Wuthering Heights on the death of his father three years later. He and his new wife Frances force Heathcliff to live as one of their servants and subject him to much verbal and emotional abuse.

Edgar Linton and his sister Isabella live nearby at Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff and Catherine spy on them out of curiosity. When Catherine is attacked by their dog, the Lintons take her in, but send Heathcliff home. The Lintons visit, and Hindley and Edgar make fun of Heathcliff; a fight ensues. Heathcliff is then made to live in the manor&#x27;s unheated, dusty attic and swears that he will one day have his revenge.

Frances dies after giving birth to a son, Hareton. Two years later, Catherine becomes engaged to Edgar. She confesses to Nelly that she loves Heathcliff, and will try to help him, but feels she cannot marry him because of his low social status. Nelly warns her against associating with a man like Heathcliff. Heathcliff overhears part of the conversation and, misunderstanding Catherine&#x27;s heart, flees the household. Distraught, Catherine falls ill.

Three years after his departure, with Edgar and Catherine now wed and expecting children, Heathcliff unexpectedly returns, now a wealthy gentleman. He encourages Isabella&#x27;s infatuation with him as a means of revenge on Catherine. Enraged by Heathcliff&#x27;s constant presence at Thrushcross Grange, Edgar banishes him. Catherine responds by locking herself in her room and refusing food; she never fully recovers. At Wuthering Heights, Heathcliff exploits Hindley&#x27;s gambling addiction and compels him to mortgage the estate to cover his losses. Heathcliff elopes with Isabella, but the relationship fails and they soon return.

When Heathcliff discovers that Catherine is dying, he visits her in secret. She dies shortly after giving birth to a daughter, Cathy, and Heathcliff rages, calling on her ghost to haunt him for as long as he lives. Isabella, bitter over Heathcliff&#x27;s devotion to a dead woman, flees south where she gives birth to Heathcliff&#x27;s son, a sickly boy named Linton. Hindley dies six months later of alcoholism, and Heathcliff then takes possession of Wuthering Heights as its new master.

Twelve years later, after Isabella&#x27;s death, the still-sickly Linton is brought back to live with his uncle Edgar at the Grange, but Heathcliff insists that his son must instead live with him. Cathy and Linton (respectively at the Grange and Wuthering Heights) gradually develop a relationship. Heathcliff schemes to ensure that they marry in order to ensure his claim to Thrushcross Grange, and on Edgar&#x27;s death demands that the couple move in with him. He becomes increasingly wild and reveals that on the night Catherine died he dug up her grave, and ever since has been plagued by her ghost. When Linton unexpectedly dies, Cathy has no option but to remain at Wuthering Heights.

Having reached the present day, Nelly&#x27;s tale concludes.

=== Ending ===
Lockwood grows tired of the moors and moves away. Eight months later he returns for a visit, and Nelly, now the housekeeper at Wuthering Heights, tells him what has happened since he left.

Heathcliff gave up his opposition to Cathy and Hareton&#x27;s union. He declined physically and started seeing visions of the dead Catherine; he avoided the young couple, saying that he could not bear to see Catherine&#x27;s eyes, which they both shared, looking at him. He eventually stopped eating, and some days later was found dead in Catherine&#x27;s old room.

Cathy has been teaching the still-uneducated Hareton to read. They plan to marry and move to the Grange, accompanied by Nelly, with Joseph being left to take care of Wuthering Heights. Nelly reports that the locals have seen the ghosts of Catherine and Heathcliff wandering abroad together. Lockwood seeks out the graves of Catherine, Edgar, and Heathcliff, and is convinced that all three are finally at peace.

=== Family tree ===


== Characters ==
* Heathcliff: A foundling from Liverpool, who is taken by Earnshaw to Wuthering Heights, where he is reluctantly cared for by the family and spoiled by his adoptive father. He and Mr. Earnshaw&#x27;s daughter, Catherine, grow close, and their love is the central theme of the first volume. His revenge against the man she chooses to marry and its consequences are the central theme of the second volume. Heathcliff has been considered a Byronic hero, but critics have pointed out that he reinvents himself at various points, making his character hard to fit into any single type. He has an ambiguous position in society, and his lack of status is underlined by the fact that &quot;Heathcliff&quot; is both his given name and his surname. The character of Heathcliff may have been inspired by Branwell Brontë. An alcoholic and an opium addict, he would have indeed terrorised Emily and her sister Charlotte during frequent crises of &quot;delirium tremens&quot; that affected him a few years before his death. Even though Heathcliff has no alcohol or drug problems, the influence of Branwell&#x27;s character is likely; although the same could be said, perhaps more appropriately, of Hindley Earnshaw and Linton Heathcliff. 
* Catherine Earnshaw: First introduced to the reader after her death, through Lockwood&#x27;s discovery of her diary and carvings. The description of her life is confined almost entirely to the first volume. She seems unsure whether she is, or wants to become, more like Heathcliff, or aspires to be more like Edgar. Some critics have argued that her decision to marry Edgar Linton is allegorically a rejection of nature and a surrender to culture, a choice with unfortunate, fateful consequences for all the other characters. She dies hours after giving birth to her daughter.
* Edgar Linton: Introduced as a child in the Linton family, he resides at Thrushcross Grange. Edgar&#x27;s style and manners are in sharp contrast to those of Heathcliff, who instantly dislikes him, and of Catherine, who is drawn to him. Catherine marries him instead of Heathcliff because of his higher social status, with disastrous results to all characters in the story. He dotes on his wife and later his daughter.
* Ellen (Nelly) Dean: The main narrator of the novel, Nelly is a servant to three generations of the Earnshaws and two of the Linton family. Humbly born, she regards herself nevertheless as Hindley&#x27;s foster-sister (they are the same age and her mother is his nurse). She lives and works among the rough inhabitants of Wuthering Heights but is well-read, and she also experiences the more genteel manners of Thrushcross Grange. She is referred to as Ellen, her given name, to show respect, and as Nelly among those close to her. Critics have discussed how far her actions as an apparent bystander affect the other characters and how much her narrative can be relied on. In &quot;The Villain in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;&quot; (1958) James Hafley argues that Nelly seems to be the moral centre of the novel only because of the instability and violence of the world she describes. In his view, she is the true villain of the novel, as she drives the majority of the conflicts, and Lockwood&#x27;s faith in her story is a sign of his innocence.
* Isabella Linton: Edgar&#x27;s sister. She views Heathcliff romantically, despite Catherine&#x27;s warnings, and becomes an unwitting participant in his plot for revenge against Edgar. Heathcliff marries her but treats her abusively. While pregnant, she escapes to London and gives birth to a son, Linton. She entrusts her son to her brother Edgar when she dies.
* Hindley Earnshaw: Catherine&#x27;s elder brother, Hindley, despises Heathcliff immediately and bullies him throughout their childhood before his father sends him away to college. Hindley returns with his wife, Frances, after Mr Earnshaw dies. He is more mature, but his hatred of Heathcliff remains the same. After Frances&#x27;s death, Hindley reverts to destructive behaviour, neglects his son, and ruins the Earnshaw family by drinking and gambling to excess. Heathcliff beats Hindley up at one point after Hindley fails in his attempt to kill Heathcliff with a pistol. He dies less than a year after Catherine and leaves his son with nothing.
* Hareton Earnshaw: The son of Hindley and Frances, raised at first by Nelly but soon by Heathcliff. Joseph works to instill a sense of pride in the Earnshaw heritage (even though Hareton will not inherit Earnshaw&#x27;s property, because Hindley has mortgaged it to Heathcliff). Heathcliff, in contrast, teaches him vulgarities as a way of avenging himself on Hindley. Hareton speaks with an accent similar to Joseph&#x27;s, and occupies a position similar to that of a servant at Wuthering Heights, unaware that he has been done out of his inheritance. He can only read his name. In appearance, he reminds Heathcliff of his aunt, Catherine.
* Catherine &quot;Cathy&quot; Linton: The daughter of Catherine and Edgar Linton, a spirited and strong-willed girl unaware of her parents&#x27; history. Edgar is very protective of her and as a result, she is eager to discover what lies beyond the confines of the Grange. Although one of the more sympathetic characters of the novel, she is also somewhat snobbish towards Hareton and his lack of education. She is forced to marry Linton Heathcliff, but after he dies she falls in love with Hareton and they marry.
* Linton Heathcliff: The son of Heathcliff and Isabella. A weak child, his early years are spent with his mother in the south of England. He learns of his father&#x27;s identity and existence only after his mother dies when he is twelve. In his selfishness and capacity for cruelty he resembles Heathcliff; physically, he resembles his mother. He marries Cathy Linton because his father, who terrifies him, directs him to do so, and soon after he dies from a wasting illness associated with tuberculosis.
* Joseph: A servant at Wuthering Heights for 60 years who is a rigid, self-righteous Christian but lacks any trace of genuine kindness or humanity. He hates nearly everyone in the novel. The Yorkshire dialect that Joseph speaks was the subject of a 1970 book by the linguist K.M. Petyt, who argued that Emily Brontë recorded the dialect of Haworth accurately.
* Mr Lockwood: The first narrator, he rents Thrushcross Grange to escape society, but in the end, decides society is preferable. He narrates the book until Chapter 4, when the main narrator, Nelly, picks up the tale.
* Frances: Hindley&#x27;s ailing wife and mother of Hareton Earnshaw. She is described as somewhat silly and is obviously from a humble family. Frances dies not long after the birth of her son.
* Mr and Mrs Earnshaw: Catherine&#x27;s and Hindley&#x27;s father, Mr Earnshaw is the master of Wuthering Heights at the beginning of Nelly&#x27;s story and is described as an irascible but loving and kind-hearted man. He favours his adopted son, Heathcliff, which causes trouble in the family. In contrast, his wife mistrusts Heathcliff from their first encounter.
* Mr and Mrs Linton: Edgar&#x27;s and Isabella&#x27;s parents, they bring up their children to be well-behaved and sophisticated. Mr Linton also serves as the magistrate of Gimmerton, as his son does in later years.
* Dr Kenneth: The longtime doctor of Gimmerton and a friend of Hindley&#x27;s who is present at the cases of illness during the novel. Although not much of his character is known, he seems to be a rough but honest person.
* Zillah: A servant to Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights during the period following Catherine&#x27;s death. Although she is kind to Lockwood, she doesn&#x27;t like or help Cathy at Wuthering Heights because of Cathy&#x27;s arrogance and Heathcliff&#x27;s instructions.
* Mr Green: Edgar&#x27;s corruptible lawyer who should have changed Edgar&#x27;s will to prevent Heathcliff from gaining Thrushcross Grange. Instead, Green changes sides and helps Heathcliff to inherit the Grange as his property.

==Publication history==

=== 1847 edition ===
The original text as published by Thomas Cautley Newby in 1847 is available online in two parts. The novel was first published together with Anne Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; in a three-volume format: &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; filled the first two volumes and &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; made up the third.

===1850 edition===
In 1850 Charlotte Brontë edited the original text for the second edition of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and also provided it with her foreword. She addressed the faulty punctuation and orthography but also diluted Joseph&#x27;s thick Yorkshire dialect. Writing to her publisher, W. S. Williams, she said that Irene Wiltshire, in an essay on dialect and speech, examines some of the changes Charlotte made.

== Critical response ==

=== Contemporary reviews ===
Early reviews of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; were mixed. Most critics recognised the power and imagination of the novel, but were baffled by the storyline, and objected to the savagery and selfishness of the characters. In 1847, when the background of an author was given great importance in literary criticism, many critics were intrigued by the authorship of the Bell novels.

The &quot;Atlas&quot; review called it a &quot;strange, inartistic story&quot;, but commented that every chapter seems to contain a &quot;sort of rugged power.&quot;

&quot;Graham&#x27;s Lady Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;How a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters, is a mystery. It is a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors&quot;.

&quot;The American Whig Review&quot; wrote: 

&quot;Douglas Jerrold&#x27;s Weekly Newspaper&quot; wrote: 

&quot;The Examiner&quot; wrote: 

&quot;The Literary World&quot; wrote: 

The English poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti admired the book, writing in 1854 that it was &quot;the first novel I&#x27;ve read for an age, and the best (as regards power and sound style) for two ages, except &quot;Sidonia&quot;&quot;, but, in the same letter, he also referred to it as &quot;a fiend of a book – an incredible monster  ... The action is laid in hell, – only it seems places and people have English names there&quot;.

Rossetti&#x27;s friend, the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne was another early admirer of the novel, and in conclusion for an essay on Emily Brontë, published in &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; in 1883, writes: &quot;As was the author&#x27;s life, so is her book in all things: troubled and taintless, with little of rest in it, and nothing of reproach. It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts; it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose.&quot;

===Twentieth century===
Until late in the 19th century &quot;&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; was regarded as the best of the Brontë sisters&#x27; novels&quot;. This view began to change in the 1880s with the publication of A. Mary F. Robinson&#x27;s biography of Emily in 1883.

Modernist novelist Virginia Woolf affirmed the greatness of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; in 1925:
Similarly, Woolf&#x27;s contemporary John Cowper Powys referred in 1916 to Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;tremendous vision&quot;.

In 1926 Charles Percy Sanger&#x27;s work on the chronology of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; &quot;affirmed Emily&#x27;s literary craft and meticulous planning of the novel and disproved Charlotte&#x27;s presentation of her sister as an unconscious artist who &#x27;did not know what she had done&#x27;.&quot; However, for a later critic, Albert J. Guerard, &quot;it is a splendid, imperfect novel which Brontë loses control over occasionally&quot;.

Still, in 1934, Lord David Cecil, writing in &quot;Early Victorian Novelists&quot;, commented &quot;that Emily Brontë was not properly appreciated; even her admirers saw her as an &#x27;unequal genius&#x27;,&quot; and in 1948 F. R. Leavis excluded &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; from the great tradition of the English novel because it was &quot;a &#x27;kind of sport&#x27;—an anomaly with &#x27;some influence of an essentially undetectable kind.&#x27;&quot;

The novelist Daphne du Maurier argued the status of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; as a &quot;supreme romantic novel&quot; in 1971:
===Twenty-first century===
Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003 writer and editor Robert McCrum placed &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; in his list of 100 greatest novels of all time. And in 2015 he placed it in his list of 100 best novels written in English. He said that 

Writing for BBC Culture in 2015 author and book reviewer Jane Ciabattari polled 82 book critics from outside the UK and presented &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; as number 7 in the resulting list of 100 greatest British novels.

In 2018 Penguin presented a list of 100 must-read classic books and placed &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; at number 71, saying: &quot;Widely considered a staple of Gothic fiction and the English literary canon, this book has gone on to inspire many generations of writersand will continue to do so&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot; journalist and author Ceri Radford and news presenter, journalist, and TV producer Chris Harvey included &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; in a list of the 40 best books to read during lockdown. Harvey said that &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers; Emily Brontë&#x27;s vision of nature blazes with poetry&quot;.

==Setting==
Novelist John Cowper Powys notes the importance of the setting:
Likewise Virginia Woolf suggests the importance of the Yorkshire landscape of Haworth to the poetic vision of both Emily and Charlotte Brontë:
Wuthering Heights is an old house high on the Pennine moorland of West Yorkshire. The first description is provided by Lockwood, the new tenant of the nearby Thrushcross Grange:

Lord David Cecil in &quot;Early Victorian Novelists&quot; (1934) drew attention to the contrast between the two main settings in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;:
Walter Allen, in &quot;The English Novel&quot; (1954), likewise &quot;spoke of the two houses in the novel as symbolising &#x27;two opposed principles which... ultimately compose a harmony&#x27;&quot;. However, David Daiches, &quot;in the 1965 Penguin English Library edition referred to Cecil&#x27;s interpretation as being &#x27;persuasively argued&#x27; though not fully acceptable&quot;. The entry on &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; in the 2002 &quot;Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot;, states that &quot;the ending of the novel points to a union of &#x27;the two contrasting worlds and moral orders represented by the Heights and the Grange&#x27;&quot;.

===Inspiration for locations===

There is no evidence that either Thrushcross Grange or Wuthering Heights is based on an actual building, but various locations have been speculated as inspirations. Top Withens, a ruined farmhouse in an isolated area near the Haworth Parsonage, was suggested as the model for Wuthering Heights by Ellen Nussey, a friend of Charlotte Brontë. However, its structure does not match that of the farmhouse described in the novel. High Sunderland Hall, near Law Hill, Halifax where Emily worked briefly as a governess in 1838, now demolished, has also been suggested as a model for Wuthering Heights. However, it is too grand for a farmhouse.

Ponden Hall is famous for reputedly being the inspiration for Thrushcross Grange, since Brontë was a frequent visitor. However, it does not match the description given in the novel and is closer in size and appearance to the farmhouse of Wuthering Heights. The Brontë biographer Winifred Gerin believed that Ponden Hall was the original of Wildfell Hall, the old mansion in Anne Brontë&#x27;s &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;. Helen Smart, while noting that Thrushcross Grange has &quot;traditionally been associated with... Ponden Hall, Stanbury, near Haworth&quot;, sees Shibden Hall, Northowram, in Halifax parish, as more likely, referring to Hilda Marsden&#x27;s article &quot;The Scenic Background of Wuthering Heights&quot;.

== Point of view ==
Most of the novel is the story told by housekeeper Nelly Dean to Lockwood, though the novel uses several narrators (in fact, five or six) to place the story in perspective, or in a variety of perspectives. Emily Brontë uses this frame story technique to narrate most of the story. Thus, for example, Lockwood, the first narrator of the story, tells the story of Nelly, who herself tells the story of another character. The use of a character like Nelly Dean is a literary device, a well-known convention taken from the Gothic novel, the function of which is to portray the events in a more mysterious and exciting manner.

Thus, the point of view comes from:

Critics have questioned the reliability of the two main narrators. The author has been described as sarcastic toward Lockwood, who fancies himself a world-weary romantic but comes across as an effete snob, and there are subtler hints that Nelly&#x27;s perspective is influenced by her own biases.

The narrative in addition includes an excerpt from Catherine Earnshaw&#x27;s old diary, and short sections narrated by Heathcliff, Isabella, and another servant.

== Influences ==

Brontë possessed an exceptional education of classical culture for a woman of the time. She was familiar with Greek tragedies and was a good Latinist. In addition she was especially influenced by the poets John Milton and William Shakespeare. There are echoes of and allusions to Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies, &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.

Another major source of information for the Brontës was the periodicals that their father read, the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot; and &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot;. &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; provided knowledge of world affairs and was a source of material for the Brontës&#x27; early writing. Emily Brontë was probably aware of the debate on evolution. This debate had been launched in 1844 by Robert Chambers. It raised questions of divine providence and the violence which underlies the universe and relationships between living things.

Romanticism was also a major influence, which included the Gothic novel, the novels of Walter Scott and the poetry of Byron. The Brontës&#x27; fiction is seen by some feminist critics as prime examples of Female Gothic. It explores the domestic entrapment and subjection of women to patriarchal authority, and the attempts to subvert and escape such restriction. Emily Brontë&#x27;s Cathy Earnshaw and Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s Jane Eyre are both examples of female protagonists in such a role.

According to Juliet Barker, Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1817) had a significant influence on &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, which, though &quot;regarded as the archetypal Yorkshire novel... owed as much, if not more, to Walter Scott&#x27;s Border country&quot;. &quot;Rob Roy&quot; is set &quot;in the wilds of Northumberland, among the uncouth and quarrelsome squirearchical Osbaldistones&quot;, while Cathy Earnshaw &quot;has strong similarities with Diana Vernon, who is equally out of place among her boorish relations&quot;.

From 1833 Charlotte and Branwell&#x27;s Angrian tales began to feature Byronic heroes. Such heroes had a strong sexual magnetism and passionate spirit, and demonstrated arrogance and black-heartedness. The Brontës had discovered Byron in an article in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from August 1825. Byron had died the previous year. Byron became synonymous with the prohibited and audacious.

=== Romance tradition ===

Emily Brontë wrote in the romance tradition of the novel. Walter Scott defined this as &quot;a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents&quot;. Scott distinguished the &quot;romance&quot; from the &quot;novel&quot;, where (as he saw it) &quot;events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society&quot;. Scott describes romance as a &quot;kindred term&quot; to novel. However, romances such as &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and Scott&#x27;s own historical romances and Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot; are often referred to as novels. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: &quot;a novel is , , , &quot;. This sort of romance is different from the genre fiction love romance or romance novel, with its &quot;emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending&quot;. Emily Brontë&#x27;s approach to the novel form was influenced by the gothic novel.

==== Gothic novel ====

Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; (1764) is usually considered the first gothic novel. Walpole&#x27;s declared aim was to combine elements of the medieval romance, which he deemed too fanciful, and the modern novel, which he considered to be too confined to strict realism.

More recently Ellen Moers, in &quot;Literary Women&quot;, developed a feminist theory that connects female writers such as Emily Brontë with gothic fiction. Catherine Earnshaw has been identified by some critics as a type of gothic demon because she &quot;shape-shifts&quot; in order to marry Edgar Linton, assuming a domesticity that is contrary to her true nature. It has also been suggested that Catherine&#x27;s relationship with Heathcliff conforms to the &quot;dynamics of the Gothic romance, in that the woman falls prey to the more or less demonic instincts of her lover, suffers from the violence of his feelings, and at the end is entangled by his thwarted passion&quot;. See also the discussion of the daemonic below, under &quot;Religion&quot;.

At one point in the novel Heathcliff is thought a vampire. It has been suggested that both he and Catherine are in fact meant to be seen as vampire-like personalities.

==Themes==

=== Morality ===

Some early Victorian reviewers complained about how &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; dealt with violence and immorality. One called it &quot;a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors&quot;.

Brontë was supposedly unaware of &quot;the limits on polite expression&quot; expected of Victorian novelists. Her characters use vulgar language, &quot;cursing and swearing&quot;. Though the daughter of a curate, Brontë shows little respect for religion in the novel; the only strongly religious character in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is Joseph, who is usually seen as satirizing &quot;the joyless version of Methodism that the Brontë children were exposed to through their Aunt Branwell&quot;. A major influence on how Brontë depicts amoral characters was the stories her father Patrick Brontë told, about &quot;the doings&quot; of people around Haworth that his parishioners told him, &quot;stories which &#x27;made one shiver and shrink from hearing&#x27; (Charlotte&#x27;s friend Ellen Nussey reported)&quot;, which were &quot;full of grim humour&quot; and violence, stories Emily Brontë took &quot;as a truth&quot;.

Shortly after Emily Brontë&#x27;s death G.H. Lewes wrote in &quot;Leader Magazine&quot;:

=== Religion ===

Emily Brontë attended church regularly and came from a religious family. Emily &quot;never as far as we know, wrote anything which overtly criticised conventional religion. But she also has the reputation of being a rebel and iconoclast, driven by a spirit more pagan than orthodox Christian.&quot; Derek Traversi, for example, sees in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; &quot;a thirst for religious experience, &#x27;which is not Christian&#x27;. It is this spirit which moves Catherine to exclaim, &#x27;surely you and everybody have a notion that there is, or should be, an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation if I were entirely contained here? (Ch. IX).

Thomas John Winnifrith, author of &quot;The Brontes and Their Background: Romance and Reality&quot; (Macmillan, 1977), argues that the allusions to Heaven and Hell are more than metaphors, and have a religious significance, because &quot;for Heathcliff, the loss of Catherine is literally Hell... &#x27;existence after losing her would be Hell&#x27; (Ch. xiv, p. 117).&quot; Likewise, in the final scene between them, Heathcliff writhes &quot;in the torments of Hell (XV)&quot;.

==== Daemonic ====
The eminent German Lutheran theologian and philosopher Rudolph Otto, author of &quot;The Idea of the Holy&quot;, saw in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; &quot;a supreme example of &#x27;the daemonic&#x27; in literature&quot;. Otto links the &quot;daemonic&quot; with &quot;a genuine religious experience&quot;. Lisa Wang argues that in both &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and in her poetry, Emily Brontë concentrates on &quot;the non-conceptual&quot;, or what Rudolf Otto has called &#x27;the non-rational&#x27; aspect of religion... the primal nature of religious experience over and above its doctrinal formulations&quot;. This corresponds with the dictionary meaning: &quot;of or relating to an inner or attendant spirit, esp. as a source of creative inspiration or genius&quot;. This meaning was important to the Romantic movement.

However, the word &quot;daemon&quot; can also mean &quot;a demon or devil&quot;, and that is equally relevant to Heathcliff, whom Peter McInerney describes as &quot;a Satanic Don Juan&quot;. Heathcliff is also &quot;dark-skinned&quot;, &quot;as dark almost as if it came from the devil&quot;. Likewise Charlotte Brontë described him &quot;&#x27;a man&#x27;s shape animated by demon life – a Ghoul – an Afreet&#x27;&quot;. In Arabian mythology an &quot;afreet&quot;, or ifrit, is a powerful jinn or demon. However, John Bowen believes that &quot;this is too simple a view&quot;, because the novel presents an alternative explanation of Heathcliff&#x27;s cruel and sadistic behaviour; that is, that he has suffered terribly: &quot;is an orphan;... is brutalised by Hindley;... relegated to the status of a servant; Catherine marries Edgar&quot;.

=== Love ===

One 2007 British poll presented &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; as the greatest love story of all time. However, &quot;some of the novel&#x27;s admirers consider it not a love story at all but an exploration of evil and abuse&quot;. Helen Small sees &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; as being both &quot;one of the greatest love stories in the English language&quot; and at the same time one of the &quot;most brutal revenge narratives&quot;. Some critics suggest that reading &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; as a love story not only &quot;romanticizes abusive men and toxic relationships but goes against Brontë&#x27;s clear intent&quot;. Moreover, while a &quot;passionate, doomed, death-transcending relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw Linton forms the core of the novel&quot;, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;:

&quot;I am Heathcliff&quot; is a frequently quoted phrase from the novel, and &quot;the idea of... perfect unity between the self and the other is age-old&quot;, so that Catherine says that she loves Heathcliff &quot;because he&#x27;s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same&quot; (Chapter IX). Likewise Lord David Cecil suggests that &quot;the deepest attachments are based on characters&#x27; similarity or affinity&quot;, However Simone de Beauvoir, in her famous feminist work &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (1949), suggests that when Catherine says &quot;I am Heathcliff&quot;: &quot;her own world collapse(s) in contingence, for she really lives in his.&quot; Beauvoir sees this as &quot;the fatal mirage of the ideal of romantic love... transcendence... in the superior male who is perceived as free&quot;.

Despite all the passion between Catherine and Heathcliff, critics have from early on drawn attention to the absence of sex. In 1850 the poet and critic Sydney Dobell suggests that &quot;we dare not doubt [Catherine&#x27;s] purity&quot;, and the Victorian poet Swinburne concurs, referring to their &quot;passionate and ardent chastity&quot;. More recently Terry Eagleton suggests their relationship is sexless, &quot;because the two, unknown to themselves, are half-siblings, with an unconscious fear of incest&quot;.

=== Childhood ===
Childhood is a central theme of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Emily Brontë &quot;understands that &#x27;The Child is &#x27;Father of the Man&#x27; (Wordsworth, &#x27;My heart leaps up&#x27;, 1. 7)&quot;. Wordsworth, following philosophers of education, such as Rousseau, explored ideas about the way childhood shaped personality. One outcome of this was the German , or &quot;novel of education&quot;, such as Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1847), Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; (1860), and Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1861). Bronte&#x27;s characters &quot;are heavily influenced by their childhood experiences&quot;, though she is less optimistic than her contemporaries that suffering can lead to &quot;change and renewal&quot;.

=== Class and money ===
Lockwood arrives at Thrushcross Grange in 1801, a time when, according to Q.D. Leavis, &quot;the old rough farming culture, based on a naturally patriarchal family life, was to be challenged, tamed and routed by social and cultural changes&quot;. At this date the Industrial Revolution was well under way, and was by 1847 a dominant force in much of England, and especially in West Yorkshire. This caused a disruption in &quot;the traditional relationship of social classes&quot; with an expanding upwardly mobile middle-class, which created &quot;a new standard for defining a gentleman&quot;, and challenged the traditional criteria of breeding and family and the more recent criterion of character.

Marxist critic Arnold Kettle sees &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; &quot;as a symbolic representation of the class system of 19th-century England&quot;, with its concerns &quot;with property-ownership, the attraction of social comforts&quot;, marriage, education, religion, and social status. Driven by a pathological hatred Heathcliff uses against his enemies &quot;their own weapons of money and arranged marriages&quot;, as well as &quot;the classic methods of the ruling class, expropriation and property deals&quot;.

Later, another Marxist, Terry Eagleton, in &quot;Myths of Power: A Marxist Study of the Brontës&quot; (London: McMillan, 1975), further explores the power relationships between &quot;the landed gentry and aristocracy, the traditional power-holders, and the capitalist, industrial middle classes&quot;. Haworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire was especially affected by changes to society and its class structure &quot;because of the concentration of large estates and industrial centers&quot; there.

==== Race ====
There has been debate about Heathcliff&#x27;s race or ethnicity. In the novel Heathcliff is first described as a &quot;dark-skinned gipsy&quot; in appearance with &quot;black eyes&quot;, as well as later being said to be &quot;as white as the wall behind him&quot; and &quot;pale...with an
expression of mortal hate.&quot;. Mr Linton, the Earnshaws&#x27; neighbour, suggests that he might be &quot;a little Lascar (a 19th-century term for Indian sailors;), or an American or Spanish castaway&quot;. Mr Earnshaw calls him &quot;as dark almost as if it came from the devil&quot;, and Nelly Dean speculates fancifully regarding his origins thus: &quot;Who knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen?&quot; Novelist Caryl Phillips suggests that Heathcliff may have been an escaped slave, noting the similarities between the way Heathcliff is treated and the way slaves were treated at the time: he is referred to as &quot;it&quot;, his name &quot;served him&quot; as both his &quot;Christian and surname&quot;, and Mr Earnshaw is referred to as &quot;his owner&quot;. Maja-Lisa von Sneidern states that &quot;Heathcliff&#x27;s racial otherness cannot be a matter of dispute; Brontë makes that explicit&quot;, further noting that &quot;by 1804 Liverpool merchants were responsible for more than eighty-four percent of the British transatlantic slave trade.&quot; Michael Stewart sees Heathcliff&#x27;s race as &quot;ambiguous&quot; and argues that Emily Brontë &quot;deliberately gives us this missing hole in the narrative&quot;.

=== Storm and calm ===

Various critics have explored the various contrast between Thrushcross Grange and the Wuthering Heights farmhouse and their inhabitants. Lord David Cecil argued for &quot;cosmic forces as the central impetus and controlling force in the novel&quot; and suggested that there is a unifying structure underlying &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;: &quot;two spiritual principles: the principle of the storm... and the principle of calm&quot;, which he further argued were not, &quot;in spite of their apparent opposition&quot;, in conflict. Dorothy van Ghent, however, refers to &quot;a tension between two kinds of reality&quot; in the novel: &quot;civilized manners&quot; and &quot;natural energies&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film and TV ===

The earliest known film adaptation of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was filmed in England in 1920 and was directed by A. V. Bramble. It is unknown if any prints still exist. The most famous is 1939&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon and directed by William Wyler. This acclaimed adaptation, like many others, eliminated the second generation&#x27;s story (young Cathy, Linton and Hareton) and is rather inaccurate as a literary adaptation. It won the 1939 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film and was nominated for the 1939 Academy Award for Best Picture.

Nigel Kneale&#x27;s script was produced for BBC Television twice, firstly in 1953, starring Richard Todd as Heathcliff and Yvonne Mitchell as Cathy. Broadcast live, no recordings of the production are known to exist. The second adaptation using Kneale&#x27;s script was in 1962, starring Claire Bloom as Catherine and Keith Michell as Heathcliff. This production does exist with the BFI, but has been withheld from public viewing. Kneale&#x27;s script was also adapted for Australian television in 1959 during a time when original drama productions in the country were rare. Broadcast live from Sydney, the performance was telerecorded, although it is unknown if this kinescope still exists.

In 1958, an adaptation aired on CBS television as part of the series &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot; starring Rosemary Harris as Cathy and Richard Burton as Heathcliff. The BBC produced a four-part television dramatisation in 1967 starring Ian McShane and Angela Scoular.

&quot;Les Hauts de Hurlevent&quot; is a French mini-series in six 26-minute episodes, in black and white, created and directed by Jean-Paul Carrère based on the novel, and broadcast between 1964 and 1968 on the first ORTF channel.

The 1970 film with Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff is the first colour version of the novel. It has gained acceptance over the years although it was initially poorly received. The character of Hindley is portrayed much more sympathetically, and his story-arc is altered. It also subtly suggests that Heathcliff may be Cathy&#x27;s illegitimate half-brother.

In 1978, the BBC produced a five-part TV serialisation of the book starring Ken Hutchinson, Kay Adshead and John Duttine, with music by Carl Davis; it is considered one of the most faithful adaptations of Emily Brontë&#x27;s story.

There is also a 1985 French film adaptation, &quot;Hurlevent&quot; by Jacques Rivette, and a 1988 Japanese film adaptation by Yoshishige Yoshida.

The 1992 film &quot;Emily Brontë&#x27;s Wuthering Heights&quot; starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche is notable for including the oft-omitted second generation story of the children of Cathy, Hindley and Heathcliff.

More recent film or TV adaptations include ITV&#x27;s 2009 two-part drama series starring Tom Hardy, Charlotte Riley, Sarah Lancashire, and Andrew Lincoln, and the 2011 film starring Kaya Scodelario and James Howson and directed by Andrea Arnold.

Adaptations which place the story in a new setting include the 1954 adaptation, retitled &quot;Abismos de pasión,&quot; directed by Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel and set in Catholic Mexico, with Heathcliff and Cathy renamed Alejandro and Catalina. In Buñuel&#x27;s version Heathcliff/Alejandro claims to have become rich by making a deal with Satan. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewed a re-release of this film as &quot;an almost magical example of how an artist of genius can take someone else&#x27;s classic work and shape it to fit his own temperament without really violating it,&quot; noting that the film was thoroughly Spanish and Catholic in its tone while still highly faithful to Brontë. Yoshishige Yoshida&#x27;s 1988 adaptation also has a transposed setting, this time to medieval Japan. In Yoshida&#x27;s version, the Heathcliff character, Onimaru, is raised in a nearby community of priests who worship a local fire god. Filipino director Carlos Siguion-Reyna made a film adaptation titled &quot;Hihintayin Kita sa Langit&quot; (1991). The screenplay was written by Raquel Villavicencio and produced by Armida Siguion-Reyna. It starred Richard Gomez as Gabriel (Heathcliff) and Dawn Zulueta as Carmina (Catherine). It became a Filipino film classic.

In 2003, MTV produced a poorly reviewed version set in a modern California high school.

Wuthering High, a 2015 TV Movie shown on Lifetime, is set in Malibu, California.

The 1966 Hindi film &quot;Dil Diya Dard Liya&quot; is based upon this novel. The film is directed by Abdul Rashid Kardar and Dilip Kumar. The film stars Dilip Kumar, Waheeda Rehman, Pran, Rehman, Shyama and Johnny Walker. The music is by Naushad. Although it did not fare as well as other movies of Dilip Kumar, it was well received by critics.

The 2000 Hindi film Dhadkan is also based upon this novel. Directed by Dharmesh Darshan and produced by Ratan Jain, it stars Akshay Kumar, Shilpa Shetty, Sunil Shetty and Mahima Chaudhry.

In 2022, Emma Mackey starred in a biopic of Emily Brontë in &quot;Emily&quot;. The film charts the life of Brontë and the inspiration she gained for writing Wuthering Heights living in the Yorkshire countryside.

===Theatre===
The novel has been adapted as operas composed by Bernard Herrmann, Carlisle Floyd, and Frédéric Chaslin (most cover only the first half of the book) and a musical by Bernard J. Taylor.

In 2021, Emma Rice directed a theatrical version which was shown online and at the Bristol Old Vic. This production was then put on at the National Theatre in 2022.

== Works inspired by &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; ==
=== Literature ===
Mizumura Minae&#x27;s &quot;A True Novel&quot; () (2002) is inspired by &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and might be called an adaptation of the story in a post-World War II Japanese setting.

In Jane Urquhart&#x27;s &quot;Changing Heaven&quot;, the novel &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, as well as the ghost of Emily Brontë, feature as prominent roles in the narrative.

In her 2019 novel, &quot;The West Indian&quot;, Valerie Browne Lester imagines an origin story for Heathcliff in 1760s Jamaica.

K-Ming Chang&#x27;s 2021 chapbook &quot;Bone House&quot; was released by Bull City Press as part of their &quot;Inch&quot; series. The collection functions as a queer Taiwanese-American retelling of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, in which an unnamed narrator moves into a butcher&#x27;s mansion &quot;with a life of its own.&quot;

Canadian author Hilary Scharper&#x27;s ecogothic novel &quot;Perdita&quot; (2013) was deeply influenced by &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; namely in terms of the narrative role of powerful, cruel and desolate landscapes.

The poem &quot;Wuthering&quot; (2017) by Tanya Grae uses &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; as an allegory.

Maryse Condé&#x27;s &quot;Windward Heights&quot; () (1995) is a reworking of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; set in Cuba and Guadeloupe at the turn of the 20th century, which Condé stated she intended as an homage to Brontë.

In 2011, a graphic novel version was published by Classical Comics. It was adapted by Scottish writer Sean Michael Wilson and hand painted by comic book veteran artist John M. Burns. This version, which stays close to the original novel, was shortlisted for the Stan Lee Excelsior Awards.

===Music===
Kate Bush&#x27;s 1978 song &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is most likely the best-known creative work inspired by Brontë&#x27;s story that is not properly an &quot;adaptation&quot;. Bush wrote the song when she was 18 and chose it as the lead single from her debut album. It was primarily inspired by her viewing of the 1967 BBC adaptation. The song is sung from Catherine&#x27;s point of view as she pleads at Heathcliff&#x27;s window to be admitted. It uses quotations from Catherine, both in the chorus (&quot;Let me in! I&#x27;m so cold!&quot;) and the verses, with Catherine admitting she had &quot;bad dreams in the night&quot;. Critic Sheila Whiteley wrote that the ethereal quality of the vocal resonates with Cathy&#x27;s dementia, and that Bush&#x27;s high register has both &quot;childlike qualities in its purity of tone&quot; and an &quot;underlying eroticism in its sinuous erotic contours&quot;. Singer Pat Benatar covered the song in 1980 on her &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot; album. Brazilian heavy metal band Angra released a version of Bush&#x27;s song on its debut album &quot;Angels Cry&quot; in 1993. A 2018 cover of Bush&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; by Jimmy Urine adds electropunk elements.

&quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; (1976) by English rock band Genesis alludes to the Brontë novel not only in the album&#x27;s title but also in the titles of two of its tracks, &quot;Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers...&quot; and &quot;...In That Quiet Earth&quot;. Both titles refer to the closing lines of the novel.

Songwriter Jim Steinman said that he wrote the 1989 song &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; &quot;while under the influence of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;&quot;. He said that the song was &quot;about being enslaved and obsessed by love&quot; and compared it to &quot;Heathcliff digging up Cathy&#x27;s corpse and dancing with it in the cold moonlight&quot;.

The 2008 song &quot;Cath...&quot; by indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie was inspired by &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.

Wuthering Heights is also the name of a Danish-Swedish power metal band.

In 2024 an indie band &quot;Mili&quot; released a single &quot;Through Patches of Violet&quot;. The song features some themes that Wuthering Heights carries, mainly - poorly communicated love. Two voices, sung by Cassie Wei, are Heathcliff and Catherine. Originally made for a game &quot;Limbus Company&quot;, which features Wuthering Heights&#x27;s other characters and story elements.

<text>Jane Eyre ( ; originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is a novel by the English writer Charlotte Brontë. It was published under her pen name &quot;Currer Bell&quot; on 19 October 1847 by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. of London. The first American edition was published the following year by Harper &amp; Brothers of New York. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a bildungsroman that follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr Rochester, the brooding master of Thornfield Hall.

The novel revolutionised prose fiction, being the first to focus on the moral and spiritual development of its protagonist through an intimate first-person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. Charlotte Brontë has been called the &quot;first historian of the private consciousness&quot; and the literary ancestor of writers such as Marcel Proust and James Joyce.

The book contains elements of social criticism with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core, and it is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane&#x27;s individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of class, sexuality, religion and feminism. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, along with Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, is one of the most famous romance novels. It is considered one of the greatest novels in the English language, and in 2003 was ranked as the tenth best-loved book in Britain by the BBC in The Big Read poll.

==Plot==
&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is divided into 38 chapters. It was originally published in three volumes in the 19th century, consisting of chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38.

The second edition was dedicated to William Makepeace Thackeray.

The novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character. Its setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign of George III (1760–1820). It has five distinct stages: Jane&#x27;s childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. Throughout these sections it provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.

The five stages of Jane&#x27;s life are as follows:

=== Gateshead Hall ===

Jane Eyre, aged 10, lives at Gateshead Hall with her maternal uncle&#x27;s family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle&#x27;s dying wish. Jane was orphaned several years earlier when her parents died of typhus. Jane&#x27;s uncle, Mr Reed, was the only one in the Reed family who was kind to Jane. Jane&#x27;s aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her and treats her as a burden. Mrs Reed also discourages her three children from associating with Jane. As a result Jane becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane&#x27;s only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane lives an unhappy childhood.
One day, as punishment for defending herself against the bullying of her 14-year-old cousin John, the Reeds&#x27; only son, Jane is locked in the &quot;red room&quot; in which her late uncle had died; there she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the &quot;ambiguous relationship between parents and children&quot; which plays out in all of Jane&#x27;s future relationships with male figures throughout the novel. She is subsequently attended to by the kindly apothecary, Mr Lloyd, to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall. He recommends to Mrs Reed that Jane should be sent to school, an idea Mrs Reed happily supports.

Mrs Reed then enlists the aid of the harsh Mr Brocklehurst, the director of Lowood Institution, a charity school for girls, to enroll Jane. Mrs Reed cautions Mr Brocklehurst that Jane has a &quot;tendency to deceit&quot;, which he interprets as Jane being a liar. Before Jane leaves, however, she confronts Mrs Reed and declares that she&#x27;ll never call her &quot;aunt&quot; again. Jane also tells Mrs Reed and her daughters, Georgiana and Eliza, that they are the ones who are deceitful, and that she will tell everyone at Lowood how cruelly the Reeds treated her. Mrs Reed is hurt badly by these words but has neither the courage nor the tenacity to show it.

=== Lowood Institution ===
At Lowood Institution, a school for poor and orphaned girls, Jane soon finds that life is harsh. She attempts to fit in and befriends an older girl, Helen Burns. During a class session her new friend is criticised for her poor stance and dirty nails and receives a lashing as a result. Later Jane tells Helen that she could not have borne such public humiliation, but Helen philosophically tells her that it would be her duty to do so. Jane then tells Helen how badly she has been treated by Mrs Reed, but Helen tells her that she would be far happier if she did not bear grudges.

In due course Mr Brocklehurst visits the school. While Jane is trying to make herself look inconspicuous, she accidentally drops her slate, thereby drawing attention to herself. She is then forced to stand on a stool and is branded a sinner and a liar. Later Miss Temple, the caring superintendent, facilitates Jane&#x27;s self-defence and publicly clears her of any wrongdoing. Helen and Miss Temple are Jane&#x27;s two main role models who positively guide her development despite the harsh treatment she has received from many others.

The 80 pupils at Lowood are subjected to cold rooms, poor meals and thin clothing. Many students fall ill when a typhus epidemic strikes; Helen dies of consumption in Jane&#x27;s arms. When Mr Brocklehurst&#x27;s maltreatment of the pupils is discovered, several benefactors erect a new building and install a sympathetic management committee to moderate Mr Brocklehurst&#x27;s harsh rule. Conditions at the school then improve dramatically.

=== Thornfield Hall ===

After six years as a pupil and two as a teacher at Lowood, Jane decides to leave in pursuit of a new life, growing bored with her life at Lowood. Her friend and confidante, Miss Temple, also leaves after getting married. Jane advertises her services as a governess in a newspaper. The housekeeper at Thornfield Hall, Alice Fairfax, replies to Jane&#x27;s advertisement. Jane takes the position, teaching Adèle Varens, a young French girl.

One night, while Jane is carrying a letter to the post from Thornfield, a horseman and dog pass her. The horse slips on ice and throws the rider. Despite the rider&#x27;s surliness, Jane helps him get back onto his horse. Later, back at Thornfield, she learns that this man is Edward Rochester, master of the house. Adèle was left in his care when her mother, a famous dancer, abandoned her. It is not immediately apparent whether Adèle is Rochester&#x27;s daughter.

At Jane&#x27;s first meeting with Mr Rochester he teases her, accusing her of bewitching his horse to make him fall. Jane stands up to his initially arrogant manner. Despite his strange behaviour, Mr Rochester and Jane soon come to enjoy each other&#x27;s company and they spend many evenings together.

Odd things start to happen at the house, such as a strange laugh being heard, a mysterious fire in Mr Rochester&#x27;s room (from which Jane saves Rochester by rousing him and throwing water on him) and an attack on a house-guest named Mr Mason.

After Jane saves Mr Rochester from the fire, he thanks her tenderly and emotionally, and that night Jane feels strange emotions of her own towards him. The next day, however, he leaves unexpectedly for a distant party and several days later returns with the whole party, including the beautiful and talented Blanche Ingram. Just as she realises that she is in love with Mr Rochester, Jane sees that he and Blanche favour each other and starts to feel jealous, particularly because she also sees that Blanche is snobbish and heartless.

Jane then receives word that Mrs Reed has suffered a stroke and is calling for her. Jane returns to Gateshead Hall and remains there for a month to tend to her dying aunt. Mrs Reed confesses to Jane that she wronged her, bringing forth a letter from Jane&#x27;s paternal uncle, Mr John Eyre, in which he asks for her to live with him and be his heir. Mrs Reed admits to telling Mr Eyre that Jane had died of fever at Lowood. Soon afterward Mrs Reed dies, and Jane helps her cousins after the funeral before returning to Thornfield.

Back at Thornfield Jane broods over Mr Rochester&#x27;s rumoured impending marriage to Blanche Ingram. However one midsummer evening Rochester baits Jane by saying how much he will miss her after getting married and how she will soon forget him. The normally self-controlled Jane reveals her feelings for him. To her surprise, Rochester reciprocates, having courted Blanche only to make Jane jealous, and proposes marriage. Jane is at first sceptical of his sincerity, before accepting his proposal. She then writes to her Uncle John, telling him of her happy news.

As she prepares for her wedding Jane&#x27;s forebodings arise when a strange woman sneaks into her room one night and rips Jane&#x27;s wedding veil in two. As with the previous mysterious events, Mr Rochester attributes the incident to Grace Poole, one of his servants. During the wedding ceremony, however, Mr Mason and a lawyer declare that Mr Rochester cannot marry because he is already married to Mr Mason&#x27;s sister, Bertha. Mr Rochester admits this is true but explains that his father tricked him into the marriage for her money. Once they were united he discovered that she was rapidly descending into congenital madness, and so he eventually locked her away in Thornfield, hiring Grace Poole as a nurse to look after her. When Grace gets drunk, Rochester&#x27;s wife escapes and causes the strange happenings at Thornfield.

It turns out that Jane&#x27;s uncle, Mr John Eyre, is a friend of Mr Mason&#x27;s and was visited by him soon after Mr Eyre received Jane&#x27;s letter about her impending marriage. After the marriage ceremony is broken off, Mr Rochester asks Jane to go with him to the south of France and live with him as husband and wife, even though they cannot be married. Jane is tempted but realises that she will lose herself and her integrity if she allows her passion for a married man to consume her and she must stay true to her Christian values and beliefs. Refusing to go against her principles, and despite her love for Rochester, Jane leaves Thornfield Hall at dawn before anyone else is up.

=== Moor House ===

Jane travels as far from Thornfield Hall as she can using the little money she had previously saved. She accidentally leaves her bundle of possessions on the coach and is forced to sleep on the moor. She unsuccessfully attempts to trade her handkerchief and gloves for food. Exhausted and starving, she eventually makes her way to the home of Diana and Mary Rivers but is turned away by the housekeeper. She collapses on the doorstep, preparing for her death. Clergyman St John Rivers, Diana and Mary&#x27;s brother, rescues her. After Jane regains her health, St John finds her a teaching position at a nearby village school. Jane becomes good friends with the sisters, but St John remains aloof.

The sisters leave for governess jobs, and St John becomes slightly closer to Jane. St John learns Jane&#x27;s true identity and astounds her by telling her that her uncle, John Eyre, has died and left her his entire fortune of 20,000 pounds (equivalent to US $2.24 million in 2022). When Jane questions him further, St John reveals that John Eyre is also his and his sisters&#x27; uncle. They had once hoped for a share of the inheritance but were left virtually nothing. Jane, overjoyed by finding that she has living and friendly family members, insists on sharing the money equally with her cousins, and Diana and Mary come back to live at Moor House.

=== Proposals ===
Thinking that the pious and conscientious Jane will make a suitable missionary&#x27;s wife, St John asks her to marry him and to go with him to India, not out of love, but out of duty. Jane initially accepts going to India but rejects the marriage proposal, suggesting they travel as brother and sister. As Jane&#x27;s resolve against marriage to St John begins to weaken, she seems to hear Mr Rochester&#x27;s voice calling her name. Jane then returns to Thornfield Hall to see if Rochester is all right, only to find blackened ruins. She learns that Rochester sent Mrs Fairfax into retirement and Adèle to school a few months following her departure. Shortly afterwards, his wife set the house on fire and died after jumping from the roof. While saving the servants and attempting to rescue his wife, Rochester lost a hand and his eyesight.

Jane reunites with Rochester, and he is overjoyed at her return, but fears that she will be repulsed by his condition. &quot;Am I hideous, Jane?&quot;, he asks. &quot;Very, sir; you always were, you know&quot;, she replies. Now a humbled man, Rochester vows to live a purer life, and reveals that he has intensely pined for Jane ever since she left. He had even called out her name in despair one night, the very call that she heard from Moor House, and heard her reply from miles away, signifying the connection between them. Jane asserts herself as a financially independent woman and assures him of her love, declaring that she will never leave him. Rochester proposes again, and they are married. They live blissfully together in an old house in the woods called Ferndean Manor. The couple stay in touch with Adèle as she grows up, as well as Diana and Mary, who each gain loving husbands of their own. St John moves to India to accomplish his missionary goals, but is implied to have fallen gravely ill there. Rochester regains sight in one eye two years after his and Jane&#x27;s marriage, enabling him to see their newborn son.

==Major characters==
In order of first line of dialogue:

===Introduced in first chapter===
* Jane Eyre: The novel&#x27;s narrator and protagonist. Orphaned as a baby, Jane struggles through her nearly loveless childhood and becomes a governess at Thornfield Hall. Small and facially plain, Jane is passionate and strongly principled and values freedom and independence. She also has a strong conscience and is a determined Christian. She is ten at the beginning of the novel, and nineteen or twenty at the end of the main narrative. As the final chapter of the novel states that she has been married to Edward Rochester for ten years, she is approximately thirty at its completion.
* Mrs Sarah Reed (née Gibson): Jane&#x27;s maternal aunt by marriage, who reluctantly adopted Jane in accordance with her late husband&#x27;s wishes. According to Mrs Reed, he pitied Jane and often cared for her more than for his own children. Mrs Reed&#x27;s resentment leads her to abuse and neglect the girl. She lies to Mr Brocklehurst about Jane&#x27;s tendency to lie, preparing him to be severe with Jane when she arrives at Brocklehurst&#x27;s Lowood School.
* John Reed: Jane&#x27;s fourteen-year-old first cousin who bullies her incessantly and violently, sometimes in his mother&#x27;s presence. Addicted to food and sweets, causing him ill health and bad complexion. John eventually ruins himself as an adult by drinking and gambling and is rumoured to have committed suicide.
* Eliza Reed: Jane&#x27;s thirteen-year-old first cousin. Envious of her more attractive younger sister and a slave to a rigid routine, she self-righteously devotes herself to religion. She leaves for a nunnery near Lisle (France) after her mother&#x27;s death, determined to estrange herself from her sister.
* Georgiana Reed: Jane&#x27;s eleven-year-old first cousin. Although beautiful and indulged, she is insolent and spiteful. Her elder sister Eliza foils Georgiana&#x27;s marriage to the wealthy Lord Edwin Vere when the couple is about to elope. Georgiana eventually marries a &quot;wealthy worn-out man of fashion.&quot;
* Bessie Lee: The nursemaid at Gateshead Hall. She often treats Jane kindly, telling her stories and singing her songs, but she has a quick temper. Later, she marries Robert Leaven with whom she has three children.
* Miss Martha Abbot: Mrs Reed&#x27;s maid at Gateshead Hall. She is unkind to Jane and tells Jane she has less right to be at Gateshead than a servant does.

===Chapters 3–5===
* Mr Lloyd: A compassionate apothecary who recommends that Jane be sent to school. Later, he writes a letter to Miss Temple confirming Jane&#x27;s account of her childhood and thereby clears Jane of Mrs Reed&#x27;s charge of lying.
* Mr Brocklehurst: The clergyman, director, and treasurer of Lowood School, whose maltreatment of the pupils is eventually exposed. A religious traditionalist, he advocates for his charges the most harsh, plain, and disciplined possible lifestyle, but, hypocritically, not for himself and his own family. His second daughter, Augusta, exclaimed, &quot;Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look… they looked at my dress and mama&#x27;s, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.&quot;
* Miss Maria Temple: The kind superintendent of Lowood School, who treats the pupils with respect and compassion. She helps clear Jane of Mr Brocklehurst&#x27;s false accusation of deceit and cares for Helen in her last days. Eventually, she marries Reverend Naysmith.
* Miss Scatcherd: A sour and strict teacher at Lowood. She constantly punishes Helen Burns for her untidiness but fails to see Helen&#x27;s substantial good points.
* Helen Burns: Jane&#x27;s best friend at Lowood School. She refuses to hate those who abuse her, trusts in God, and prays for peace one day in heaven. She teaches Jane to trust Christianity and dies of consumption in Jane&#x27;s arms. Elizabeth Gaskell, in her biography of the Brontë sisters, wrote that Helen Burns was &#x27;an exact transcript&#x27; of Maria Brontë, who died of consumption at age 11.

===Chapters 11–12===
* Mrs Alice Fairfax: The elderly, kind widow and the housekeeper of Thornfield Hall; distantly related to the Rochesters.
* Adèle Varens: An excitable French child to whom Jane is a governess at Thornfield Hall. Adèle&#x27;s mother was a dancer named Céline. She was Mr Rochester&#x27;s mistress and claimed that Adèle was Mr Rochester&#x27;s daughter, though he refuses to believe it due to Céline&#x27;s unfaithfulness and Adèle&#x27;s apparent lack of resemblance to him. Adèle seems to believe that her mother is dead (she tells Jane in chapter 11, &quot;I lived long ago with mamma, but she is gone to the Holy Virgin&quot;). Mr Rochester later tells Jane that Céline actually abandoned Adèle and &quot;ran away to Italy with a musician or singer&quot; (ch. 15). Adèle and Jane develop a strong liking for one another, and although Mr Rochester places Adèle in a strict school after Jane flees Thornfield Hall, Jane visits Adèle after her return and finds a better, less severe school for her. When Adèle is old enough to leave school, Jane describes her as &quot;a pleasing and obliging companion—docile, good-tempered and well-principled&quot;, and considers her kindness to Adèle well repaid.
* Grace Poole: &quot;…a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face…&quot; Mr Rochester pays her a very high salary to keep his mad wife, Bertha, hidden and quiet. Grace is often used as an explanation for odd happenings at the house such as strange laughter that was heard not long after Jane arrived. She has a weakness for drinking that occasionally allows Bertha to escape.
* Edward Fairfax Rochester: The master of Thornfield Hall. A Byronic hero, he has a face &quot;dark, strong, and stern.&quot; He married Bertha Mason years before the novel begins.
* Leah: The housemaid at Thornfield Hall.

===Chapters 17–21===
* Blanche Ingram: Young socialite whom Mr Rochester plans to marry. Though possessing great beauty and talent, she treats social inferiors, Jane in particular, with undisguised contempt. Mr Rochester exposes her and her mother&#x27;s mercenary motivations when he puts out a rumour that he is far less wealthy than they imagine.
* Richard Mason: An Englishman whose arrival at Thornfield Hall from the West Indies unsettles Mr Rochester. He is the brother of Rochester&#x27;s first wife, the woman in the attic, and still cares for his sister&#x27;s well-being. During the wedding ceremony of Jane and Mr Rochester, he exposes the bigamous nature of the marriage.
* Robert Leaven: The coachman at Gateshead Hall, who brings Jane the news of the death of the dissolute John Reed, an event which has brought on Mrs Reed&#x27;s stroke. He informs her of Mrs Reed&#x27;s wish to see Jane before she dies.

===Chapters 26–32===
* Bertha Antoinetta Mason: The first wife of Edward Rochester. After their wedding, her mental health began to deteriorate, and she is now violent and in a state of intense derangement, apparently unable to speak or go into society. Mr Rochester, who insists that he was tricked into the marriage by a family who knew Bertha was likely to develop this condition, has kept Bertha locked in the attic at Thornfield Hall for years. She is supervised and cared for by Grace Poole, whose drinking sometimes allows Bertha to escape. After Richard Mason stops Jane and Mr Rochester&#x27;s wedding, Rochester finally introduces Jane to Bertha: &quot;In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell… it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.&quot; Eventually, Bertha sets fire to Thornfield Hall and throws herself to her death from the roof. Bertha is viewed as Jane&#x27;s &quot;double&quot;: Jane is pious and just, while Bertha is savage and animalistic. Though her race is never mentioned, it is sometimes conjectured that she was of mixed race. Rochester suggests that Bertha&#x27;s parents wanted her to marry him, because he was of &quot;good race&quot;, implying that she was not pure white, while he was. There are also references to her &quot;dark&quot; hair and &quot;discoloured&quot; and &quot;black&quot; face. A number of writers during the Victorian period suggested that madness could result from a racially &quot;impure&quot; lineage, compounded by growing up in a tropical West Indian climate.
* Diana and Mary Rivers: Sisters in a remote moors house who take Jane in when she is hungry and friendless, having left Thornfield Hall without making any arrangements for herself. Financially poor but intellectually curious, the sisters are deeply engrossed in reading the evening Jane appears at their door. Eventually, they are revealed to be Jane&#x27;s cousins. They want Jane to marry their stern clergyman brother so that he will stay in England rather than journey to India as a missionary. Diana marries naval Captain Fitzjames, and Mary marries clergyman Mr Wharton. The sisters remain close to Jane and visit her and Rochester every year.
* Hannah: The kindly housekeeper at the Rivers home; &quot;…comparable with the Brontës&#x27; well-loved servant, Tabitha Aykroyd.&quot;
* St John Eyre Rivers: A handsome, though severe and serious, clergyman who befriends Jane and turns out to be her cousin. St John is thoroughly practical and suppresses all of his human passions and emotions, particularly his love for the beautiful and cheerful heiress Rosamond Oliver, in favour of good works. He wants Jane to marry him and serve as his assistant on his missionary journey to India. After Jane rejects his proposal, St John goes to India unmarried.
* Rosamond Oliver: A beautiful, kindly, wealthy, but rather simple young woman, and the patron of the village school where Jane teaches. Rosamond is in love with St John, but he refuses to declare his love for her because she would not be suitable as a missionary&#x27;s wife. She eventually becomes engaged to the respected and wealthy Mr Granby.
* Mr Oliver: Rosamond Oliver&#x27;s wealthy father, who owns a foundry and needle factory in the district. &quot;…a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright flower near a hoary turret.&quot; He is a kind and charitable man, and he is fond of St John.

==Context==

The early sequences, in which Jane is sent to Lowood, a harsh boarding school, are derived from the author&#x27;s own experiences. Helen Burns&#x27;s death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as a result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge, near Tunstall, Lancashire. Mr Brocklehurst is based on Rev. William Carus Wilson (1791–1859), the Evangelical minister who ran the school. Additionally, John Reed&#x27;s decline into alcoholism and dissolution recalls the life of Charlotte&#x27;s brother Branwell, who became an opium and alcohol addict in the years preceding his death. Finally, like Jane, Charlotte became a governess. These facts were revealed to the public in &quot;The Life of Charlotte Brontë&quot; (1857) by Charlotte&#x27;s friend and fellow novelist Elizabeth Gaskell.

The Gothic manor of Thornfield Hall was probably inspired by North Lees Hall, near Hathersage in the Peak District in Derbyshire. This was visited by Charlotte Brontë and her friend Ellen Nussey in the summer of 1845, and is described by the latter in a letter dated 22 July 1845. It was the residence of the Eyre family, and its first owner, Agnes Ashurst, was reputedly confined as a lunatic in a padded second floor room. It has been suggested that the Wycoller Hall in Lancashire, close to Haworth, provided the setting for Ferndean Manor to which Mr Rochester retreats after the fire at Thornfield: there are similarities between the owner of Ferndean—Mr Rochester&#x27;s father—and Henry Cunliffe, who inherited Wycoller in the 1770s and lived there until his death in 1818; one of Cunliffe&#x27;s relatives was named Elizabeth Eyre (née Cunliffe). The sequence in which Mr Rochester&#x27;s wife sets fire to the bed curtains was prepared in an August 1830 homemade publication of Brontë&#x27;s &quot;The Young Men&#x27;s Magazine, Number 2&quot;. Charlotte Brontë began composing &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; in Manchester, and she likely envisioned Manchester Cathedral churchyard as the burial place for Jane&#x27;s parents and Manchester as the birthplace of Jane herself.

==Adaptations and influence==

The novel has been adapted into a number of other forms, including theatre, film, television, and at least three full-length operas. The novel has also been the subject of a number of significant rewritings and related interpretations, notably Jean Rhys&#x27;s seminal 1966 novel &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;.

A famous line in the book is at the beginning of Chapter 38: &quot;Reader, I married him.&quot; Many authors have used a variation of this line in their work. For example, Liane Moriarty discussed and used the line in her 2018 novel &quot;Nine Perfect Strangers&quot;.

The book &quot;Reader, I Married Him: Stories inspired by Jane Eyre&quot;, a 2016 anthology of short stories, edited by Tracy Chevalier, was also inspired by this line. It was commissioned to mark the 200th anniversary of Brontë&#x27;s birth, and is published by The Borough Press, an imprint of HarperCollins.

Thai novel &quot;Ruk Diow Kong Jenjira&quot; was adapted by Nida in 1993. In 1996, it was made into a television drama on Channel 3 starred by Willie McIntosh and Sirilak Pongchoke.

The novel &quot;The French Dancer&#x27;s Bastard&quot;, by Emma Tennant, reimagines the back story of Adèle, exploring whether she was Rochester&#x27;s love child and what her relationship with Jane Eyre is.

The most recent film adaptation, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, was released in 2011, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, and starred Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester. The film, actors, and costume design team were nominated and won various awards from 2011 to 2012.

==Reception==

=== Contemporary reviews ===
&quot;Jane Eyre&quot;″s initial reception contrasts starkly to its reputation today. In 1848, Elizabeth Rigby (later Elizabeth Eastlake), reviewing &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; in &quot;The Quarterly Review&quot;, found it &quot;pre-eminently an anti-Christian composition,&quot; declaring: &quot;We do not hesitate to say that the tone of mind and thought which has overthrown authority and violated every code human and divine abroad, and fostered Chartism and rebellion at home, is the same which has also written &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;&quot;

An anonymous review in &quot;The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction&quot; writes of &quot;the extraordinary daring of the writer of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;&quot;; however, the review is mostly critical, summarising: &quot;There is not a single natural character throughout the work. Everybody moves on stilts—the opinions are bad—the notions absurd. Religion is stabbed in the dark—our social distinctions attempted to be levelled, and all absurdly moral notions done away with.&quot;

There were some who felt more positive about the novel contemporaneously. George Henry Lewes said, &quot;It reads like a page out of one&#x27;s own life; and so do many other pages in the book.&quot; Another critic from the &quot;Atlas&quot; wrote, &quot;It is full of youthful vigour, of freshness and originality, of nervous diction and concentrated interest ...It is a book to make the pulses gallop and the heart beat, and to fill the eyes with tears.&quot;

A review in &quot;The Era&quot; praised the novel, calling it &quot;an extraordinary book&quot;, observing that &quot;there is much to ponder over, rejoice over, and weep over, in its ably-written pages. Much of the heart laid bare, and the mind explored; much of greatness in affliction, and littleness in the ascendant; much of trial and temptation, of fortitude and resignation, of sound sense and Christianity—but no tameness.&quot;

&quot;The People&#x27;s Journal&quot; compliments the novel&#x27;s vigour, stating that &quot;the reader never tires, never sleeps: the swell and tide of an affluent existence, an irresistible energy, bears him onward, from first to last. It is impossible to deny that the author possesses native power in an uncommon degree—showing itself now in rapid headlong recital, now in stern, fierce, daring dashes in portraiture—anon in subtle, startling mental anatomy—here in a grand illusion, there in an original metaphor—again in a wild gush of genuine poetry.&quot;

American publication &quot;The Nineteenth Century&quot; defended the novel against accusations of immorality, describing it as &quot;a work which has produced a decided sensation in this country and in England... &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; has made its mark upon the age, and even palsied the talons of mercenary criticism. Yes, critics hired to abuse or panegyrize, at so much per line, have felt a throb of human feeling pervade their veins, at the perusal of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. This is extraordinary—almost preternatural—smacking strongly of the miraculous—and yet it is true... We have seen &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; put down, as a work of gross immorality, and its author described as the very incarnation of sensualism. To any one, who has read the work, this may look ridiculous, and yet it is true.&quot;

&quot;The Indicator&quot;, concerning speculation regarding the gender of the author, wrote, &quot;We doubt not it will soon cease to be a secret; but on one assertion we are willing to risk our critical reputation—and that is, that no woman wrote it. This was our decided conviction at the first perusal, and a somewhat careful study of the work has strengthened it. No woman in all the annals of feminine celebrity ever wrote such a style, terse yet eloquent, and filled with energy bordering sometimes almost on rudeness: no woman ever conceived such masculine characters as those portrayed here.&quot;

=== Twentieth century ===
Literary critic Jerome Beaty believed the close first-person perspective leaves the reader &quot;too uncritically accepting of her worldview&quot;, and often leads reading and conversation about the novel towards supporting Jane, regardless of how irregular her ideas or perspectives are.

In 2003, the novel was ranked number 10 in the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

== Genres ==

=== Romance ===

Before the Victorian era, Jane Austen wrote literary fiction that influenced later popular fiction, as did the work of the Brontë sisters produced in the 1840s. Brontë&#x27;s love romance incorporates elements of both the gothic novel and Elizabethan drama, and &quot;demonstrate[s] the flexibility of the romance novel form.&quot;

=== Gothic ===

The Gothic genre uses a combination of supernatural features, intense emotions, and a blend of reality and fantasy to create a dark, mysterious atmosphere and experience for characters and readers. Jane Eyre is a homodiegetic narrator, which allows her to exist both as a character and narrator in the story world, and her narration establishes an emotional connection and response for the reader. This intentional, narrative technique works in tandem with Gothic features and conventions. Jane and the reader are unaware of the cause behind the &quot;demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep&quot; or &quot;a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall,&quot; though the reason comes from Bertha Mason. The element of the unknown works in conjunction to the possibility of the supernatural. The intensity of emotions and reactions to Gothic conventions can solely exist in the protagonist&#x27;s imagination. Instances that a protagonist interprets to be their imagination turns into reality. Jane&#x27;s experience in the red room represents an aspect of Gothic conventions as Jane feels fear towards being punished in the red room because she believes and imagines that her dead uncle haunts the room.

The Gothic genre uses the Gothic double: a literary motif, which is described as the protagonist having a double, alter ego, or doppelgänger interpreted between Jane Eyre and Bertha Mason, where Bertha represents the other side of Jane and vice versa. The commonly used Gothic literary device, foreshadowing, creates an environment filled with tension, ominousity, and dread. After Jane agrees to marry Rochester, a horse-chestnut tree in an orchard is struck by lightning, splitting the tree in half. The lightning strike is ominous and foreshadows Jane and Rochester&#x27;s separation.

The Gothic Genre in tandem with Murphy&#x27;s the &quot;New Woman Gothic&quot; establishes an opportunity to go against the Romantic&#x27;s concept that the antagonist is usually a villainous father. The Gothic genre allows there to be a complex consideration of who or what hinders Jane&#x27;s happiness. The barriers Jane experiences, whether related to social class, societal and cultural norms, Bertha Mason, or Rochester, have antagonistic elements.

=== Bildungsroman ===
The Bildungsroman representation in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; uses romantic elements that emphasise the journey of one pursuing the discovery of one&#x27;s identity and knowledge. Jane Eyre desires the thrill and action that comes from being an active individual in society, and she refuses to allow the concept of gender and class to hinder her.

Bildungsroman was primarily viewed through male life progression, but feminist scholars have worked to counteract the male norm of bildungsroman by including female development. Experiences that deem a female narrative to be bildungsroman would be the female protagonist discovering how to manage living in a restrictive society. The novel&#x27;s setting is the English society of the early 19th century, and with that time setting come specific restrictions women encountered during that time, such as the law of coverture, the lack of rights, and the restricted expectations placed on women. Jane Eyre does not specifically and directly deal with the restrictions of, for example coverture, but her character lives in a society where coverture exists, which inadvertently impacts social and cultural norms and expectations. Progression in the bildungsroman does not necessarily occur in a linear direction. Many narratives that employ bildungsroman do so through the protagonist&#x27;s development of maturity, which is represented through the protagonist&#x27;s experiences from childhood to adulthood; this progression is in conjunction with the novel&#x27;s narrative technique set as an autobiography. Temporally, the beginning of the novel begins with Jane at age ten and ends with Jane at age thirty, but Jane&#x27;s development of maturity goes beyond her age. For example, Jane&#x27;s emotional intelligence grows through her friendship with Helen Burns as Jane experiences and processes the loss of her friendship with Helen.

Many times, the 19th-century female bildungsroman can be interpreted as the heroine&#x27;s growth of self and education in the context of prospective marriage, especially when, in the context of 19th-century womanhood, a wife experiences new knowledge in the private sphere of her role. Jane develops knowledge and experience regarding a romantic journey before her almost marriage to Mr. Rochester; a physical, spiritual, and financial knowledge during her time with St. John; and lastly, with her marriage with Mr. Rochester at the end of the novel. Jane&#x27;s search for excitement and understanding of life goes beyond her romantic journey. In the text, Jane&#x27;s childhood beliefs about religion, as seen in her interactions with Mr. Brocklehurt, shift considerably in comparison to her friendship with Helen in Lowood as a child and in her marital and missionary rejection of St. John as an adult woman.

== Themes ==
=== Race ===
Throughout the novel there are frequent themes relating to ideas of ethnicity (specifically that of Bertha), which are a reflection of the society that the novel is set within. Mr Rochester claims to have been forced to take on a &quot;mad&quot; Creole wife, a woman who grew up in the West Indies, and who is thought to be of mixed-race descent. In the analysis of several scholars, Bertha plays the role of the racialised &quot;other&quot; through the shared belief that she chose to follow in the footsteps of her parents. Her apparent mental instability cast her as someone who is incapable of restraining herself, almost forced to submit to the different vices she is a victim of. Many writers of the period believed that one could develop mental instability or mental illnesses simply based on their race.

This means that those who were born of ethnicities associated with a darker complexion, or those who were not fully of European descent, were believed to be more mentally unstable than their white European counterparts were. According to American scholar Susan Meyer, in writing &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; Brontë was responding to the &quot;seemingly inevitable&quot; analogy in 19th-century European texts which &quot;[compared] white women with blacks in order to degrade both groups and assert the need for white male control&quot;. Bertha serves as an example of both the multiracial population and of a &#x27;clean&#x27; European, as she is seemingly able to pass as a white woman for the most part, but also is hinted towards being of an &#x27;impure&#x27; race since she does not come from a purely white or European lineage. The title that she is given by others of being a Creole woman leaves her a stranger where she is not black but is also not considered to be white enough to fit into higher society.

Unlike Bertha, Jane Eyre is thought of as being sound of mind before the reader is able to fully understand the character, simply because she is described as having a complexion that is pale and she has grown up in a European society rather than in an &quot;animalistic&quot; setting like Bertha. Jane is favoured heavily from the start of her interactions with Rochester, simply because like Rochester himself, she is deemed to be of a superior ethnic group than that of his first wife. While she still experiences some forms of repression throughout her life (the events of the Lowood Institution) none of them are as heavily taxing on her as that which is experienced by Bertha. Both women go through acts of suppression on behalf of the men in their lives, yet Jane is looked at with favour because of her supposed &quot;beauty&quot; that can be found in the colour of her skin. While both are characterised as falling outside of the normal feminine standards of this time, Jane is thought of as superior to Bertha because she demands respect and is able to use her talents as a governess, whereas Bertha is seen as a creature to be confined in the attic away from &quot;polite&quot; society.

Scholars have also noted the novel&#x27;s overt references and allusions to slavery, arguably its North American iteration.

==== &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; ====
Jean Rhys intended her critically acclaimed novel &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic. The book won the notable WH Smith Literary Award in 1967. Rhys explores themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr Rochester and deteriorates in England as &quot;The Madwoman in the Attic&quot;. Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.

=== Feminism ===
The idea of the equality of men and women emerged more strongly in the Victorian period in Britain, after works by earlier writers, such as Mary Wollstonecraft. R. B. Martin described &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; as the first major feminist novel, &quot;although there is not a hint in the book of any desire for political, legal, educational, or even intellectual equality between the sexes.&quot; This is illustrated in chapter 23, when Jane responds to Rochester&#x27;s callous and indirect proposal:

Do you think I am an automaton? a machine without feelings?...Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong—I have as much soul as you,—and full as much heart...I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;—it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God&#x27;s feet, equal,—as we are.

The novel &quot;acted as a catalyst&quot; to feminist criticism with the publication by S. Gilbert and S. Gubar&#x27;s &quot;The Madwoman in the Attic&quot; (1979), the title of which alludes to Rochester&#x27;s wife. The Brontës&#x27; fictions were cited by feminist critic Ellen Moers as prime examples of Female Gothic, exploring woman&#x27;s entrapment within domestic space and subjection to patriarchal authority, and the transgressive and dangerous attempts to subvert and escape such restriction. Both &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; explore this theme.

=== Social class ===
Throughout the novel, Jane undergoes various social class transitions, in response to her life&#x27;s varying situations. As a child, she mixes with middle class people through the Reed family, though Jane is not at the same level of social class as the rest of the Reed family. While at Lowood, she experiences the life of children whose guardians can afford the school fees of &quot;fifteen pounds per year&quot; but nonetheless are &quot;charity children&quot; &quot;because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching&quot;, living in poor conditions, and later working there as an adult as a teacher on a salary of fifteen pounds. She has an opportunity to be a private governess, and in so doing double her salary, but her governess position makes her aware of her ambiguous social position as a governess to a child with a wealthy guardian. After Jane leaves Thornfield Hall, she is stripped of her class identity as she travels across the moors and arrives at Moor House. But Jane receives an inheritance which she shares with her new-found family, and this offers a different form of independence.
