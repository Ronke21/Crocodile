<text>Gus Hall (born Arvo Kustaa Halberg; October 8, 1910 – October 13, 2000) was an American activist who served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) from 1959 to 2000. As a labor leader, Hall was closely associated with the so-called &quot;Little Steel&quot; Strike of 1937, an effort to unionize the nation&#x27;s smaller, regional steel manufacturers. During the Second Red Scare, he was indicted under the Smith Act and was sentenced to eight years in prison. After his release, Hall led the CPUSA for over 40 years, generally taking an orthodox Marxist–Leninist stance and becoming a perennial candidate for president of the United States.

==Background and early political activism==

Hall was born Arvo Kustaa Halberg in 1910 in Cherry Township, St. Louis County, Minnesota, a rural community on northern Minnesota&#x27;s Mesabi Iron Range. He was Finnish-American, the son of Matt (Matti) and Susan (Susanna) Halberg. Hall&#x27;s parents were Finnish immigrants from the Finland, Lapua region, and were politically radical: they were involved in the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and were early members of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) in 1919. The Mesabi Range was one of the most important immigration settlements for Finns, who were often active in labor militancy and political activism. Hall&#x27;s home language was Finnish, and he conversed with his nine siblings in that language for the rest of his life. He did not know political terminology in Finnish and used mostly English when meeting with visiting Finnish Communists.

Hall grew up in a Communist home and was involved early on in politics. According to Hall, after his father was banned from working in the mines for joining an IWW strike, the family grew up in near-starvation in a log cabin built by Halberg.

At 15, to support the impoverished ten-child family, Hall left school and went to work in the North Woods lumber camps, mines and railroads. Two years later in 1927, he was recruited to the CPUSA by his father. Hall became an organizer for the Young Communist League (YCL) in the upper Midwest. In 1931, an apprenticeship in the YCL qualified Hall to travel to the Soviet Union to study for two years at the International Lenin School in Moscow.

==Move to Minneapolis==
After his studies, Hall moved to Minneapolis to further the YCL activities there. He was involved in hunger marches, demonstrations on behalf of farmers, and various strikes during the Great Depression. In 1934, Hall was jailed for six months for taking part in the Minneapolis Teamster&#x27;s Strike, led by Trotskyist Farrell Dobbs. After serving his sentence, Hall was blacklisted and was unable to find work under his original name. He changed his name to Gus Hall, derived from Kustaa (Gustav) Halberg. The change was confirmed in court in 1935.

==Ohio activism==
In late 1934, Hall went to Ohio&#x27;s Mahoning Valley. Following the call for organizing in the steel industry, Hall was among a handful hired at a steel mill in Youngstown, Ohio. During 1935–1936, he was involved in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and was a founding organizer of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC), which was set up by the CIO. Hall stated that he and others persuaded John L. Lewis, who was one of the founders of the CIO, that steel could be organized.

==Marriage and family==
In Youngstown, Hall met Elizabeth Mary Turner (1909–2003), a woman of Hungarian background. They were married in 1935. Elizabeth was a leader in her own right, among the first women steelworkers and a secretary of SWOC. They had two children, Barbara (Conway) (born 1938) and Arvo (born 1947).

==&quot;Little Steel&quot; strike and war service==
Hall was a leader of the 1937 &quot;Little Steel&quot; strike, so called because it was directed against Republic Steel, Bethlehem Steel and the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, as opposed to the industry giant U.S. Steel. It had previously entered into a contract with SWOC without a strike. The strike was ultimately unsuccessful, and marred by the deaths of workers at Republic plants in Chicago and Youngstown. Hall was arrested for allegedly transporting bomb-making materials intended for Republic&#x27;s plant in Warren, Ohio. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was fined $500. SWOC became the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) in 1942. Philip Murray, USWA founding president, once commented that Hall&#x27;s leadership of the strike in Warren and Youngstown was a model of effective grassroots organizing.

After the 1937 strike, Hall focused on party activities instead of union work, and became the leader of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) in Youngstown in 1937. His responsibilities in the party grew rapidly, and in 1939 he became the CPUSA leader for the city of Cleveland. Hall ran on the CPUSA ticket for Youngstown councilman and also for governor of Ohio, but received few votes. In 1940 Hall was convicted of fraud and forgery in an election scandal and spent 90 days in jail.

Hall volunteered for the United States Navy when World War II broke out, serving as a machinist in Guam. During the first years of the war in Europe, the CPUSA held an isolationist stance, as the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were cooperating based on the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. When Hitler broke the treaty by invading the USSR in June 1941, the CPUSA began to officially support the war effort. During his naval service, Hall was elected in absence to the National Committee of the CPUSA. He was honorably discharged from the Navy on March 6, 1946.

Seen as a Moscow loyalist, Hall&#x27;s reputation in the party rose after the war. In 1946 he was elected to the national executive board of the party under the new general secretary, Eugene Dennis, a pro-Soviet Marxist–Leninist, who had replaced Earl Browder after the latter&#x27;s expulsion from the party.

==Indictment during the Red Scare and rise to the head of the CPUSA==

Now a major American communist leader in the post-war era, Hall caught the attention of United States officials. On July 22, 1948, Hall and 11 other Communist Party leaders were indicted under the Alien Registration Act, popularly called the Smith Act, on charges of &quot;conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government by force and violence&quot;, although his conviction was based entirely on Hall&#x27;s advocacy of Marxist thought. Hall&#x27;s initial prison sentence lasted for five years.

Released on bail, Hall rose to the secretariat of the CPUSA. When the Supreme Court upheld the Smith Act (June 4, 1951), Hall and three other men skipped bail and went underground. Hall&#x27;s attempt to flee to Moscow failed when he was picked up in Mexico City on October 8, 1951. He was sentenced to three more years and eventually served over five and a half years in Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. In prison he distributed party leaflets and lifted weights. He was located in a cell adjacent to that of George Kelly, a notorious gangster of the prohibition era. The Supreme Court of the United States later reversed some convictions under the Smith Act as unconstitutional.

In the early 1960s, Hall was in danger of facing yet another indictment, this time under the Internal Security Act of 1950, known as the McCarran Act, but the Supreme Court found the Act partly unconstitutional, and the government abandoned its charges. The act required &quot;Communist action&quot; organizations to register with the government, it excluded party members from applying for United States passports or holding government jobs. Because of the Act, Hall&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license was revoked by the State of New York.

After his release, Hall continued his activities. He began to travel around the United States, ostensibly on vacation but gathering support to replace Dennis as the general secretary. He accused Dennis of cowardice for not going underground as ordered in 1951 and also claimed Dennis had used funds reserved for the underground for his own purposes. Hall&#x27;s rise to the position of general secretary was generally unexpected by the American Communist circles (the post was expected to go to either Henry Winston or Gil Green, both important figures in the YCL), although Hall had held the office of acting general secretary briefly in the early 1950s after Dennis&#x27;s arrest. In 1959, Hall was elected CPUSA general secretary and afterward received the Order of Lenin.

==General Secretary of the CPUSA==
The McCarthy era had taken a heavy toll on the Communist Party USA, as many American members were called to testify to congressional committees. In addition, due to the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, many members became disenchanted and left the party. They were also moved by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s dismissal of Stalinism. In the United States, the rise of the New Left and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 created hostility between leftists and the CPUSA, marginalizing it.

Hall, along with other party leaders who remained, sought to rebuild the party. He led the struggle to reclaim the legality of the Communist Party and addressed tens of thousands in Oregon, Washington, and California. Envisioning a democratization of the American Communist movement, Hall spoke of a &quot;broad people&#x27;s political movement&quot; and tried to ally his party with radical campus groups, the anti-Vietnam War movement, organizations active in the civil rights movement, and the new rank-and-file trade union movements in an effort to build the CPUSA among the young &quot;baby boomer&quot; generation of activists. Ultimately, Hall failed to forge a lasting alliance with the New Left.

Hall had a reputation of being one of the most convinced supporters of the actions and interests of the Soviet Union outside the USSR&#x27;s political sphere of influence. From 1959 onward, Hall spent some time in Moscow each year and was one of the most widely known American politicians in the USSR, where he was received by high-level Soviet politicians such as Leonid Brezhnev.

Hall spoke regularly on campuses and talk shows as an advocate for socialism in the United States. He argued for socialism in the United States to be built on the traditions of U.S.-style democracy rooted in the United States Bill of Rights. He would often say Americans didn&#x27;t accept the Constitution without a Bill of Rights and wouldn&#x27;t accept socialism without a Bill of Rights. He professed deep confidence in the democratic traditions of the American people. He remained a prolific writer on current events, producing a great number of articles and pamphlets, of which many were published in the magazine &quot;Political Affairs&quot;.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Hall also made frequent appearances on Soviet television, always supporting the position of the Soviet regime. Hall guided the CPUSA in accordance with the party line of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), rejecting any liberalization efforts such as Eurocommunism. He also dismissed the radical new revolutionary movements that criticized the official Soviet party line of &quot;Peaceful coexistence&quot; and called for a world revolution. After the Sino-Soviet split, Maoism likewise was condemned, and all Maoist sympathizers were expelled from the CPUSA in the early 1960s.

Hall defended the Soviet invasions of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, and supported the Stalinist principle of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot;. In the early 1980s, Hall and the CPUSA criticized the Solidarity movement in Poland. In 1992, the Moscow daily &quot;Izvestia&quot; claimed that the CPUSA had received over $40 million in payments from the Soviet Union, contradicting Hall&#x27;s long-standing claims of financial independence. The former KGB General Oleg Kalugin declared in his memoir that the KGB had Hall and the American Communist Party &quot;under total control&quot; and that he was known to be siphoning off &quot;Moscow money&quot; to set up his own horse-breeding farm. The writer and J. Edgar Hoover biographer Curt Gentry has noted that a similar story about Hall was planted in the media through the FBI&#x27;s secret COINTELPRO campaign of disruption and disinformation against radical opposition groups.

==Presidential candidate and later years==

In the 1964 United States presidential election, Hall&#x27;s party supported Lyndon B. Johnson, saying it was necessary to prevent the victory of the conservative Barry Goldwater. During the 1972 presidential election, the CPUSA withdrew its support from the Democratic Party and nominated Hall as its candidate. Hall ran for president four times — in 1972, 1976, 1980, and 1984 — the last two times with Angela Davis. Of the four elections, Hall received the largest number of votes in 1976, largely because of the Watergate scandal bringing protest votes for minor parties. Hall ranked only in eighth place among the presidential candidates. Owing to the great expense of running, the difficulty in meeting the strenuous and different election law provisions in each state, and the difficulty in getting media coverage, the CPUSA decided to suspend running national campaigns while continuing to run candidates at the local level. While ceasing presidential campaigns, the CPUSA did not renew support for the Democratic party.
The 1980s were a politically difficult decade for Hall and the CPUSA, as one of Hall&#x27;s trusted confidants and the deputy head of the CPUSA, Morris Childs, was revealed in 1980 to be a longtime Federal Bureau of Investigation informant. Although Childs was taken into the United States Federal Witness Protection Program and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1987, Hall continued to deny that Childs had been a spy. Also, Henry Winston, Hall&#x27;s African-American deputy, died in 1986. The black party base questioned the fact that the leadership was exclusively white.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the party faced another crisis. In a press conference that year, Hall warned of witch hunts and McCarthyism in Russia, comparing that country unfavorably with North Korea. Hall led a faction of the party that stood against Glasnost and Perestroika and, for the hardliners of the CPSU, accused Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin of &quot;demolishing&quot; socialism. Hall supported Vietnam and Cuba but criticized the People&#x27;s Republic of China for failing to oppose the West. In late 1991, members wanting reform founded the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism, a group critical of the direction in which Hall was taking the party. When they were unable to influence the leadership, they left the party and Hall purged them from the membership, including such leaders as Angela Davis and Charlene Mitchell.

During the last years of his life, Hall lived in Yonkers, New York, with his wife, Elizabeth. Along with following political events, Hall engaged in hobbies that included art collecting, organic gardening, and painting. In 2000, shortly before his death, Hall resigned the post of party chairman in favor of Sam Webb and was appointed honorary chairman. In 1994, Michael Myerson, who had left the CPUSA along with Herbert Aptheker, Angela Davis, Gil Green, and Charlene Mitchell, accused Hall of living a &quot;good bourgeois life&quot; including &quot;an estate in fashionable Hampton Bays.&quot;

Gus Hall died on October 13, 2000, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan from diabetes mellitus complications. He was buried in the Forest Home Cemetery near Chicago.

==Criticism==
When the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and its leaders in the Midwest Teamsters were prosecuted under the Smith Act in Minnesota in 1941, some Communist Party members supported the government actions. Later, Hall admitted it was a mistake for the party to not openly fight against imprisonment of SWP members under the Smith Act. The Trotskyist movement held strong negative opinions against Hall; upon his death, the Trotskyist World Socialist Web Site denounced him for what they perceived as his incompetence, loyalty to the Soviet Union and accused abandonment of the working class.

At times, some Soviet officials criticized Hall by accusing him of poor leadership of the CPUSA. Young American communists were advised to distance themselves from CPUSA, as the party was under intense FBI surveillance, and these officials believed that under such conditions the party could not be successful.

Many conservatives saw Hall as a threat to the United States, with J. Edgar Hoover describing him as &quot;a powerful, deceitful, dangerous foe of Americanism.&quot; An inflammatory anti-Christian statement was falsely ascribed to Hall, earning him the hostility of some Christian groups, including Jerry Falwell&#x27;s Moral Majority. In a 1977 speech, future U.S. president Ronald Reagan planned to quote this alleged 1961 statement as proof of the evils of communism: &quot;I dream of the hour when the last congressman is strangled to death on the guts of the last preacher — and since the Christians seem to love to sing about the blood, why not give them a little of it? Slit the throats of their children [and] draw them over the mourner&#x27;s bench and the pulpit and allow them to drown in their own blood, and then see whether they enjoy singing those hymns.&quot; The statement, which Reagan ultimately excised from his speech because he claimed he did not have the &quot;nerve&quot; to say it, was falsely claimed to have been said by Hall at the funeral oration of former CPUSA party chairman William Z. Foster. Hall would later make positive comments about Christianity; in 1963, he called the papal encyclical Pacem in terris &quot;the work of a great Pope&quot;. According to Francis Nigel Lee, Hall held Pope John XXIII in high regard and hoped for dialogue between Catholics and Communists, writing in &quot;Political Affairs&quot; that &quot;Marxists have shown their remarkable willingness to go along with Pope John&#x27;s giant step forward.&quot; Gus Hall is also reported to have said: “Our quarrel is with capitalism, not God.”

Hall was also accused of homophobia, as the CPUSA followed a Stalinist doctrine of declaring homosexuality a &quot;fascist tendency&quot;. As a result, openly gay party members such as Harry Hay were expelled from the party in the 1950s. The Communist Party was critical of newly emerging social movements in the 1960s and 1970s, keeping its distance from the New Left. Nevertheless, some CPUSA members attempted to appeal to the youth, with Gil Green arguing that “the correct line should have been to try to turn this upheaval amongst young people into a permanent kind of movement while letting its dynamics work itself out with our participation.” Despite the fact that the Communist party of Mexico and some Afro-American communists such as Jarvis Tyner and Kendra Alexander opposed homophobia, CPUSA was opposed to gay rights, with the official party programme from early 1970s condemning any behaviour “which encourages or promotes homosexual relationships as an alternative to sound, healthy, male–female relationships or distracts from the family as the basic unity of society and the fundamental component of the future we see to bring into being” and repudiating “as false any attempt to depict the so-called gay lifestyle as part of advanced and even revolutionary movements, or to promote it in the guise of a progressive ideology&quot;. However, Hall himself was not homophobic. According to Erwin Marquit, Hall sought to moderate the party&#x27;s hostile stance towards gay groups, and when questioned by the student council of the University of Minnesota, he stated his opposition to expelling homosexual members from the party. Hall had also intervened on behalf of Bernard Koten, a party member who was arrested in Kiev in August 1963 and charged with homosexuality. Hall reacted strongly to the news of Koten&#x27;s arrest and called for the charges to be dropped &quot;unless a more serious crime is involved&quot;. After protests from Hall and a number of progressive activists, Koten was released without trial.

<doc id="55856" wikidata="Q41329" url="?curid=55856" title="Linz">
<text>Linz ( , ; ) is the capital of Upper Austria and third-largest city in Austria. Located on the river Danube, the city is in the far north of Austria, south of the border with the Czech Republic. As of 1 January 2024, the city has a population of 212,538. It is the 7th largest of all cities on the Danube river.

== History ==

Linz originated as a Roman fort named &quot;Lentia&quot;, established in the first century. The name reflects its location at a bend in the Danube (Celtic root &quot;lentos&quot; = &quot;bendable&quot;). This strategic position on the river made it the first Roman fort in the Noricum region, protecting a vital transportation route.

The name &quot;Linz&quot; in its present form was first documented in 799.

Linz was mentioned as a fortified city in 1236 and was granted city rights in 1324.

Johannes Kepler spent several years of his life in the city teaching mathematics. On 15 May 1618 he discovered Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion. The local public university Johannes Kepler University Linz is named for him.

The &quot;Oeconomische Encyclopädie&quot; (also simply known as &quot;the Krünitz&quot;), with the entry about Linz being written around 1800, describes the city as well built and fortified and its economy as growing, partially because of its location on the Danube and the connection to routes to Hungary and Vienna. When written, the city had a population of 16-17 thousand. Major industries were the productions of gunpowder, iron, steel, salt, firewood and predominantly, the wool industry:

A wool manufactuary, established in 1672, was the biggest in then-Austria, or rather, the Austrian states. It was nationalized in 1754. Plans, made in 1770, of selling it to a tradesman were canceled. Although it kept production going, its &quot;golden era &quot;was over. 

When the &quot;Krünitz&quot; entry was written, the manufactuary had a yearly revenue of 1.5 million &quot;Gulden&quot; and was generating a hundred thousand in profit and was employing around 30 thousand people.

Anton Bruckner spent the years between 1855 and 1868 working as a local composer and organist in the Old Cathedral, Linz. The Brucknerhaus is named for him.

Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn (an Austrian town near the German border) and moved to Linz during his childhood. The notorious Holocaust bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann also spent his youth in Linz. Until the end of his life, Hitler considered Linz to be his hometown. Hitler effected the founding of the Bruckner Symphony Orchestra, which began presenting concerts in autumn 1943. His plan for one of the bell towers in Linz to play a theme from Bruckner&#x27;s Fourth Symphony never came to pass. 

During World War II Linz was a giant industrial complex in support of the Nazi war effort. Hermann Göring supervised the construction of the Voest complex, ultimately a gigantic construction site built by slave labour. The Mauthausen concentration camp was established to the east of Linz, but three Mauthausen sub-camps were within the Voest complex.

In addition to an ordnance depot Linz had a benzol plant which was bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II. The city&#x27;s confrontation with its Nazi past resulted in the renaming of many streets. In 1945, immediately after the end of the Nazi dictatorship, 39 streets in Linz were renamed, but from 1946 to 1987, only two streets were renamed. However, since 1988, 17 new traffic areas were named after victims of National Socialism or resistance fighters.

== Economy ==

Linz is one of the main economic centres of Austria. Voestalpine is a large technology and capital goods group, founded as the &quot;Reichswerke Hermann Göring&quot; during World War II. It is now known for basic oxygen steelmaking technique. The former &quot;Chemie Linz&quot; chemical group has been split up into several companies.

The Meeting Industry Report Austria (mira) ranks Linz as the third most important destination for congresses in Austria, with a share of 7.4 percent in the total number of congresses, conferences and seminars held in Austria. Linz has more than 60 congress and event venues. With the Blue Meeting concept, the local tourism association has developed a conference format which focuses on individual needs of participants and adapts to the idea of green meetings, therefore supporting waste minimisation, energy efficiency, climate-neutral travel, as well as regional added value.

=== Donau-Harbor ===
Furthermore, due to the fact that one of the four Donau-Harbors (Donauhäfen) in Austria is located in Linz, it constitutes an attractive location in regards to logistic and trading enterprises. Manufacturing plants can be found along the waterfront. The economic importance of Linz was founded over centuries in trade. Large industrial enterprises are still located in Linz nowadays. Important examples are the Voestalpine AG.

=== Shopping ===

Thirteen shopping malls can be found in Linz, three of which are situated in the city centre. Shopping centres include: Arkade, Atrium City Center, Shopping Mall Auwiesen, Shopping Mall Biesenfeld, Shopping Mall Industriezeile, Shopping Mall Kleinmünchen, Shopping Mall Muldenstraße, EuroCenter Oed, Shopping Mall Wegscheid, Infra Center, Lentia City, Passage, and PRO-Kaufland.

According to a study by Infrapool in Oktober 2010, the Linzer Landstraße is the busiest shopping street outside of Vienna. The weekly frequency is noted between 240,500 (Monday-Saturday, 8 a.m. until 7 p.m.) and 228,400 (8 a.m. until 6 p.m.) passers-by, which is the second highest value – only in 2005 more passers-by were detected. 

=== Markets ===
There are eleven farmer&#x27;s markets as well as one weekly flea market, and two Christmas markets in Linz. One of these markets, the &quot;Urfahraner Markt&quot;, takes place in spring and fall every year. Furthermore, there are annually Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Markets. The aim of the market administration is to provide the population with a wide range of products, as well as operating the markets in an economical, suitable and customer oriented manner. Additionally, the annual market called &quot;Linzer Marktfrühling&quot; sets further accents and lures new customers with attractive offers.

== Transport ==
Linz Airport lies about southwest of the town centre, in the municipality of Hörsching. The airport can be reached easily via federal highways B139 and B1. The bus line 601 connects the airport within 20 minutes with the centre of Linz. There is also a free shuttle service from Hörsching railway station. Direct flights include Frankfurt, Düsseldorf and Vienna with additional seasonal routes added during the summer and winter months, like for example Mallorca, Ibiza, Tenerife, several Greek islands (like Kos, Rhodes, Crete or Corfu) or Hurghada. Ryanair also flies to London Stansted Airport.

The city also has a central railway station () on Austria&#x27;s main rail axis, the West railway, linking Vienna with western Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The Linz central station has been awarded eight times (from 2005 to 2011 and 2014) by Austrian Traffic Club as the most beautiful train station in Austria.

Local public transport comprises the city tram network, the city trolleybus network and the city bus network, all operated by the Linz Linien division of Linz AG. The city tram network includes the Pöstlingbergbahn, a steeply graded tramway which climbs a small mountain at the northwest edge of the town.

==Population==
The urban area includes (parts of) 13 other municipalities with together 271,000 inhabitants. Linz is also part of the Linz-Wels-Steyr metropolitan area of Upper Austria, home to around one third of the state&#x27;s population (460,000 people) and second-largest urban area in Austria.

== Statistical Districts ==
Since January 2014 the city has been divided into 16 statistical districts:
Before 2014 Linz was divided into nine districts and 36 statistical quarters. They were:

#Ebelsberg

Some restaurants and cafés are closed on Sundays. 
== Destinations of interest==


The main street &quot;Landstraße&quot; leads from the &quot;Blumauerplatz&quot; to &quot;Taubenmarkt&quot; (Pigeonmarket) near the main square. The main square (built in 1230), with an area of , is one of the largest converted squares in Europe. In the middle of the main square the high &quot;Pestsäule&quot; (&quot;plague column&quot;, also known as &quot;Dreifaltigkeitssäule&quot; (Dreifaltigkeit means Holy Trinity)) was built to remember the people who died in the plague epidemics. It was designed by Antonio Beduzzi in 1713, and was finished in 1723.

Around the main square are many historically relevant and architecturally interesting houses, such as the Old Town Hall, the Feichtinger House with its carillon, which changes the melody depending on the season, the Kirchmayr House, the Schmidtberger House or the bridgehead buildings, which house a part of the Linz Art University.

West of the main square there is the old quarter with many other historic buildings, such as Renaissance houses or older houses with a baroque face.

Near the Schloss/castle, being the former residence of emperor Friedrich the III—the oldest Austrian church is located: Sankt/Saint Martins church. It was built during early medieval Carolingian times.

* St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral (Mariä-Empfängnis-Dom), Roman Catholic, in Gothic-Revival style. With a total height of , the cathedral is the tallest church in Austria. Constructed in the years of 1862 and 1924, it is fully built of sandstone with unfinished front details. 
* Mozarthaus is the house, dating to the end of the 16th century, where the famous Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed the &quot;Linz&quot; Symphony and &quot;Linz&quot; Sonata during a three-day stay there in November 1783. Today, the exterior and inner courtyard of the house can be visited, but not the interior. 
* Pöstlingberg-Kirche: pilgrimage church on the Pöstlingberg hill. The basilica is the city&#x27;s landmark and was built from 1738 until 1774, located on 537m sea level. 
* Pöstlingbergbahn is the steepest mountain rail in the world which was built in 1898 and operates gear-wheel free (functional grip between wheel and rail: gradient of 10.5%) 
* Linzer Grottenbahn: A grotto railway is based up on the hill of Pöstling
* Brucknerhaus: the concert and congress house located on the Donaulände was first opened in 1973 and is venue of the Brucknerfest since 1974. It is named after the composer Anton Bruckner, who was born in Ansfelden, a small town next to Linz. The modern Concert Hall owes its unique acoustics to its wood paneling.

== Architecture ==

As many central European cities, the cityscape of Linz is characterised by small and several sacred buildings. The Mariä Empfängnis Dom or New Cathedral is the biggest church in Austria, not by height (it is roughly 2 metres shorter than the St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral (&quot;Stephansdom&quot;) in Vienna), but by capacity.

The historic centre is characterised by its medieval architectural style, whereas in those parts of the city that border with the historic centre the architecture is of neoclassical, neo-baroque and neo-renaissance styles. Even further from the historic centre there are living areas, such as &quot;Franckviertel&quot;, &quot;Froschberg&quot;, &quot;Bindermichl&quot; and &quot;Kleinmünchen&quot; southern of the Danube and &quot;Alt-Urfahr&quot; northern of the Danube. These areas are where residential buildings can be found that are still referred to as &quot;Hitlerbauten&quot; or &quot;Hitler buildings&quot;, because they were built during the interwar period and the time of Nazi dictatorship. The residential area called &quot;Gugl&quot; became a well liked living area among the wealthy at around 1900, which is why there are numerous villas still there today.

Amongst the newer buildings is the Linz Hauptbahnhof station, which was designed by Wilhelm Holzbauer and added the Terminal Tower skyscraper as part of a mixed-use complex. Between 2005 und 2011 it was voted Austria&#x27;s most beautiful railway station seven times in a row by the &quot;Verkehrsclub Österreich&quot;. The Wissensturm (&quot;Tower of knowledge&quot;) with a height of about 63 metres, houses the public library and the &quot;Volkshochschule&quot;, an adult education centre. It was designed by Franz Kneidinger and Heinz Stögmüller and opened in 2007. Lentos Art Museum, which opened in 2003, was designed by Zürich-based architects Weber &amp; Hofer and the Musiktheater (music theatre), which opened in 2013, was designed by Terry Pawson.

==Culture==
The city is now home to a vibrant music and arts scene that is well-funded by the city and the state of Upper Austria. Between Lentos Art Museum and the &quot;Brucknerhaus&quot;, is the &quot;Donaulände&quot;, which is also referred to as &quot;Kulturmeile&quot; (&quot;culture mile&quot;). This is a park alongside the river, which is used mainly by young people to relax and meet in summer. It is also used for the Ars Electronica Festival in early September and the &quot;Stream Festival&quot;, which takes place annually. In June, July and August the &quot;Musikpavillon&quot; is placed in the park where musical groups of different styles perform on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays free of charge. 

Linz has other culture institutions, such as the Posthof, which is near the harbour, and the Stadtwerkstatt, which is by the river Danube. The Pflasterspektakel, an international street art festival, takes place each year in July in and around the Landstraße and the main square.
Linz was the European Capital of Culture in 2009, along with Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania.

The aim is to maintain and represent the cultural diversity. 

The Ars Electronica Center can be considered as the centre of media art and attracts every year during its festival national and international guests to Linz.

The latest project developed by Linz in the context of the City of Media Arts project is the Valie Export Center, which is located in the Tabakfabrik (tobacco factory) and carried out in cooperation with the University of Art and Design Linz. It serves as an international research hub for media and performance art. Beyond that, it comprises the legacy as well as the archives of the most renowned media artist coming from Linz, Valie Export, who has received numerous national as well as international prizes. Along with the Ars Electronica archives, Linz hosts two internationally renowned archives for media art.

Since 2009, the Open Commons Linz initiative has made available a wide variety of &quot;free&quot; data: geo-data and statistical information having to do with city life, local government, recreation and tourism. An associated effort is the Hotspot initiative that has installed 202 hotspots providing free WLAN, as well as Public Server, the municipal cloud available to all citizens registered in Linz. Linz is thus at the forefront in Europe when it comes to universal access to open data.

Linz houses 43 galleries and exhibit rooms, 13 cultural centres, one club centre, as well as four educational institutes.

=== Museums ===

* The Lentos (built 2003) is a modern art gallery, presenting art from the 20th and 21st centuries. It is situated on the south banks of the river Danube. The building can be illuminated at night from the inside with blue, pink, red and violet, due to its plastic casing.
* Ars Electronica Center (AEC) (also called &quot;museum of the future&quot;) is a museum and research facility on the north bank of the Danube (in the Urfahr district), across the river from the Hauptplatz (main square).

===Music===
The Brucknerhaus, a famous concert hall in Linz is named after Anton Bruckner. It is situated just some 200 metres away from the &quot;Lentos&quot;. It is home to the &quot;Bruckner Orchestra&quot;, and is frequently used for concerts, as well as balls and other events. It is also the venue of the &quot;Linz Fest&quot; which takes place annually in May as well as one of the venues during the Ars Electronica Festival in early September. In June, July and August the &quot;Musikpavillon&quot; is placed in the park where musical groups of different styles perform on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays free of charge.

The Musiktheater (music theatre) was opened in April 2013 and is considered to be one of the most modern opera houses in Europe. It offers five stages of varying sizes; the big hall (&quot;Großer Saal&quot;) with 1,200 seats, the BlackBox with up to 270 seats, the BlackBoxLounge with up to 150 seats, the orchestra hall (&quot;Orchestersaal&quot;) with up to 200 seats and another stage in the foyer (&quot;FoyerBühne&quot;). Performances at the Musiktheater include operas and typically Austrian operettas, ballets and musicals.

The ensemble of the Landestheater (regional theatre) Linz used to perform musical productions as well as theatre productions at a venue located on the &quot;Promenade&quot; in the inner city of Linz (this venue is still referred to simply as &quot;Landestheater&quot;). Since the opening of the new Musiktheater, only theatre performances take place at the &quot;Promenade&quot; venue, whereas musical productions are shown in the Musiktheater. The Landestheater Linz is especially renowned for its theatre for young audiences called u\hof:.

The &quot;Posthof&quot; is one of the biggest event centres in Linz with three rooms offering up to 630 seats or standing room for about 1,200 people respectively in the big hall. The programme focuses on contemporary art and covers concerts, theatre, cabaret, dance and literature. Artists from Linz are regularly invited to improve the local cultural scene; e.g. bands from Linz get the opportunity to play as pre-bands alongside nationally and internationally known artists. Altogether a total of about 250 events take place at the &quot;Posthof&quot; each year with a total number of visitors of about 80.000.

The &quot;Stadtwerkstatt&quot; is an independent association for culture and was founded in 1979. Its headquarters is located in the Urfahr district on the north bank of the Danube close to the Ars Electronica Centre and serves as venue for music events and other artistic and cultural activities. Situated at the same address is the Stadtwerkstatt&#x27;s own Café Strom café/bar.

===Cinema===
The history of cinema and film begins in Linz in September 1896, when, as part of a variety programme, a film programme was shown in &quot;Roithner&#x27;s vaudeville&quot; for the first time in Upper Austria. Until the next screening of a film it took until 20 March 1897, when Johann Bläser&#x27;s travelling cinema guested in the &quot;Hotel of the Golden Ship&quot;.

Until the opening of the first cinemas with regular programme, it took till the end of the year 1908. At that time, Karl Lifka opened his &quot;Lifka&#x27;s Grand Théâtre électrique&quot; in that building, where already the very first film showing took place. Subsequently, the second cinema of Linz was opened a few months later.

As the owner of travelling cinemas, Johann Bläser, got settled in Linz, he bought the &quot;Hotel of the Golden Ship&quot;, and installed a cinema in it, the &quot;Bio-Kinematograph&quot;. 
The third stationary cinema, called &quot;Kino Kolloseum&quot;, in town was founded around 1910 by the vaudeville operator Karl Roithner. Its first location was the former festival hall at Hessenplatz.

The Linz International Short Film Festival is the first film festival in Upper Austria to focus on international short films. It launched in October 2018 at the Moviemento in Linz, showing 114 films over four days. The concept goes back to the festival director Parisa Ghasemi.

=== Culinary specialties ===
In Linz there are both traditional restaurants and old wine taverns, as well as modern and exotic cuisine. The influence of 140 nations can be felt in Linz&#x27;s culinary offerings. A coalition of over 40 restaurants, cafes and among other locations bars are called &quot;hotspots&quot;. Moreover, Linz has several à la carte restaurants and Gault Millau gourmet restaurants.

Typical dishes in Linz include not only the famous Linzer torte but also knödel and strudel in many different kinds of variations. Another specialty is the erdäpfelkäs, a spread made from mashed potatoes and cream. Some well-known chefs from Linz are Lukas Erich, who cooks in the &quot;Verdi&quot; and Georg Essig from the &quot;Der neue Vogelkäfig&quot;.

===Commemorative year 2018===
The project &quot;Linz 1938/1918&quot;, which started on 29 June 2018, commemorates the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic (1918) and 80 years of &quot;political union&quot; (1938). With this installation in the public space, presented in the city center, Linz fulfills its responsibility and commitment to maintaining peace with its declaration, making a contribution to dealing with the past.

Since Schiller Park in 1909, there has been no newly opened park of this magnitude in the centre of Linz.
* Landschaftspark Bindermichl-Spallerhof: In the first phase of the establishment of the 8.3 -hectare sized area, which reconnects the boroughs Bindermichl and Spallerhof, the province of Upper Austria was responsible for the expansion of the park. The park replaces the urban motorway, which runs subterranean in this area since 2006.

<text>Innsbruck (; ) is the capital of Tyrol and the fifth-largest city in Austria. On the River Inn, at its junction with the Wipp Valley, which provides access to the Brenner Pass to the south, it had a population of 132,493 in 2018.

In the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the Karwendel Alps (Hafelekarspitze, ) to the north and Patscherkofel () and Serles () to the south, Innsbruck is an internationally renowned winter sports centre; it hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics as well as the 1984 and 1988 Winter Paralympics. It also hosted the first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012 and is going to host the 2027 Winter Deaflympics.

The name means &quot;bridge over the Inn&quot;.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
The earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early Stone Age. Surviving pre-Roman place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the Romans established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today&#x27;s urban district Wilten) at Oenipons (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from Verona-Brenner-Augsburg in their province of Raetia.

The first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name &quot;Oeni Pontum&quot; or &quot;Oeni Pons&quot; which is Latin for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of Andechs acquired the town in 1180. In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the Counts of Tyrol. The city&#x27;s arms show a bird&#x27;s-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the Brenner Pass was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the Alps. It was part of the Via Imperii, a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.

===Early history===

Innsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor Maximilian I also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor&#x27;s presence as can be seen for example in the Hofkirche. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a cenotaph and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the Habsburg emperor are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and Mechelen was established in 1490 by the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post.
In 1564 Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria received the rulership over Tyrol and other Further Austrian possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had Schloss Ambras built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna&#x27;s Kunsthistorisches Museum. Up to 1665 a of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).

The university was founded in 1669. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor Leopold I again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.
During the Napoleonic Wars Tyrol was ceded to Bavaria, ally of France. Andreas Hofer led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the Battles of Bergisel against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean militia army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the Vienna Congress Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in the Tyrol province.

The Tyrolean hero Andreas Hofer was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.

Innsbruck played a part during the revolution of 1848 in Austria. In May of that year, riots in Vienna made Emperor Ferdinand to move the seat of government temporarily to that city.

During World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On 20 February 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded. In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.

In 1929, the first official Austrian Chess Championship was held in Innsbruck.

===Annexation and World War II===
In 1938 Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the &quot;Anschluss&quot;. During World War II, Innsbruck was the location of two subcamps of the Dachau concentration camp, including a special camp for prominent people from 16 countries and their families, who were held as hostages, including former Prime Minister of France Léon Blum, former regent of Hungary Miklós Horthy, former Chancellor of Austria Kurt Schuschnigg, Italian general Giuseppe Garibaldi II and a nephew of Winston Churchill. Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two air raids and suffered heavy damage.

===Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino===
In 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino by recognizing the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Innsbruck has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) using isotherm or oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) using the original isotherm since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains. Winters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the foehn wind sometimes brings pronounced thaws.

Spring is brief; days start to get warm, often over , but nights remain cool or even freezing.

Summer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting . In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the diurnal temperature variation is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being on average, but sometimes dipping as low as .

The average annual temperature is .

Innsbruck is located along the A12/A13 highway corridor (Inn Valley Autobahn and Brenner Autobahn respectively), providing freeway access to Verona, Italy and Munich, Germany. The A12 and A13 converge near Innsbruck, at which point the A13 terminates.

Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof, the most important railway station of Innsbruck and Tyrol, is one of the busiest railway stations in Austria. It is served by the Lower Inn Valley line to Germany and eastern Austria, the Arlberg line to the west and the Brenner line, which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the Brenner Pass. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the Innsbruck S-Bahn.

Innsbruck Airport is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Vienna. It also handles regional flights around the Alps, as well as seasonal flights to other destinations. During the winter, activity increases significantly, due to the high number of skiers travelling to the region. The airport is approximately from the centre of Innsbruck.
Local public transport is provided by Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe (IVB), a public authority operating a network of bus and tram routes. The metre-gauge tram network consists of four city lines, 1, 2, 3 and 5, and two lines serving the surrounding area: , the Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn to Igls, and line &quot;STB&quot;, the Stubaitalbahn running through the Stubai Valley to Fulpmes. The network is planned to be enlarged during the coming years to reach the neighboring village Rum in the east and Völs in the west. Numerous bus lines serve the inner city and connect it with surrounding areas. Until 2007 the bus network included two trolleybus routes, but these were abandoned in preparation for planned expansion of the tram network.

In December 2007, the Hungerburgbahn, a funicular service to the district of Hungerburg, was reopened after a two-year closure for extensive rebuilding, with partial realignment and a new extension under the Inn River and into central Innsbruck. The line was also equipped with new vehicles. Because of the unique design of the stations, drafted by the famous architect Zaha Hadid, the funicular evolves immediately to a new emblem of the city. The line was rebuilt by the Italian company Leitner, and can now carry up to 1,200 persons per hour. It is operated by a private company, the &#x27;Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen&#x27;.

<text>Salzburg (, ; , also known as &quot;Salzburgerland&quot;; ) is an Austrian federal state. In German it is called a , a German-to-English dictionary translates that to &quot;federal state&quot; and the European Commission calls it a &quot;province&quot;. In German, its official name is , to distinguish it from its eponymous capital Salzburg. For centuries, it was an independent Prince-Bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire. It borders Germany and Italy.

==Geography==
===Location===
Salzburg State covers an area of . It stretches along its main river — the Salzach – which rises in the Central Eastern Alps in the south to the Alpine foothills in the north. It is located in the north-west of Austria, close to the border with the German state of Bavaria; to the northeast lies the federal state Upper Austria; to the east the federal state Styria; to the south the federal states Carinthia and Tyrol. With 561,714 inhabitants, it is one of the country&#x27;s smaller federal states in terms of population.

Running through the south are the main ranges of the Alpine divide (incl. the Hohe Tauern mountains) with numerous three-thousanders. The Dachstein massif and the Berchtesgaden Alps ranges of the Northern Limestone Alps border Salzburg State to the east and north.

===Regions===
The federal state is traditionally subdivided in five major regions (&quot;Gaue&quot;), congruent with its political districts (&quot;Bezirke&quot;, see administrative divisions).

* In the northern part:
** Flachgau (Salzburg city and environs), the flat () Salzburg Basin around the confluence of Salzach and Saalach, stretching from the slopes of the Salzkammergut Mountains in the east to the Untersberg massif and the Chiemgau Alps in the west.
** Tennengau (district capital Hallein), named after the Tennen Mountains, including the broad Salzach Valley south of Salzburg and the surrounding ranges of the Limestone Alps.
* The southern, mountainous (colloquially &quot;Innergebirg&quot;) part is divided into:
** Pinzgau (Zell am See) in the southwest,
** Pongau (St. Johann im Pongau) on Salzach and Enns, and
** Lungau (Tamsweg) in the southeast, separated by the Niedere Tauern range.

===Major cities and towns===
Salzburg municipalities with town privileges:

* Salzburg (pop. 148,521)
* Hallein (20,022)
* Saalfelden (16,046)
* St. Johann im Pongau (10,740)
* Bischofshofen (10,352)
* Zell am See (9,683)
* Seekirchen (9,945)
* Neumarkt am Wallersee (5,846)
* Oberndorf bei Salzburg (5,600)
* Mittersill (5,443)
* Radstadt (4,864)
Wals-Siezenheim, a common municipality with about 12,000 inhabitants, is known as &#x27;Austria&#x27;s largest village&#x27;.

==History==

Salt mining has played an important role in the region&#x27;s development; &quot;Salzburg&quot; means &quot;salt city&quot;.

===Salzburg as an independent state===
Independence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century. The Archbishopric of Salzburg was an independent prince-bishopric and State of the Holy Roman Empire until German Mediatisation in 1803.

===Electorate of Salzburg===

The territory was secularized and, as the Electorate of Salzburg, given as compensation to Ferdinand III, former Grand Duke of Tuscany, the brother of Emperor Francis II.

===The end of independence===
Following the Austrian defeat at Austerlitz in 1805, Salzburg was annexed by Austria as compensation for the loss of Tyrol to the Kingdom of Bavaria, and Ferdinand was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Würzburg.

===Bavarian Salzburg===
After Austria&#x27;s defeat in 1809, the federal state was handed over to Bavaria in 1810.

===The country divided between Bavaria and Austria===
In 1816, following the defeat of Napoleon and the provision of adequate compensation to Bavaria at the Congress of Vienna, it was returned to Austria with the exception of the north-western Rupertiwinkel which remained Bavarian. The Salzburger Land was administered as the department of Salzach from Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. In 1849 the Duchy of Salzburg was established as a crown land of the Austrian Empire and, after 1866, Austria-Hungary.

===World War I===
Salzburg participated in World War I, as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 49,000 Salzburgers were called to arms, of whom 6,000 were killed.

===Post-World War I Austrian republics===

In 1918 after World War I, the Duchy of Salzburg was dissolved and replaced with the State of Salzburg, as a component part initially of German Austria and subsequently of the First Republic of Austria, the separate state which was mandated by the Allied powers.

===Salzburg in Germany===
As a result of &quot;Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria&quot; in 1938, Austria, including Salzburg State, was incorporated into Nazi Germany.

===American control===
After the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, the Allies occupied the territory of Austria, being recognized as an independent territory under their rule. Salzburg State was occupied by the United States.

===Salzburg as an Austrian federal state===
In 1955, Austria was again declared an independent state and Salzburg was once again one of the reconstituted federal states of the Second Republic of Austria.

==Demographics==
The historical population is given in the following chart:
==Politics==
Salzburg adopted its current provincial constitution in 1999. The provincial government (&quot;Landesregierung&quot;) is headed by a governor (Landeshauptmann), who is elected by a majority in the provincial parliament Landtag. Provincial elections are held every five years.

After World War II, most provincial governments were led by the conservative Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP). ÖVP politician Josef Klaus (1910-2001), later chancellor of Austria, served as governor of Salzburg from 1949 till 1961. In 2004 Gabi Burgstaller became the first Social Democratic (and first female) governor of Salzburg.

The last results, in April 2023 (Compared to 2018) were:

The current governor of Salzburg, Wilfried Haslauer (ÖVP), entered into coalition discussions with the FPÖ, after his proposition of a ÖVP-FPÖ-SPÖ coalition was rejected by the Social Democrats. Haslauer said &quot;I regret that we could not implement the Alliance for Salzburg&quot;. After successful coalition negotiations, the ÖVP and the FPÖ entered into a governing coalition with Haslauer as the Governor and Marlene Svazek as the First Deputy Governor. Salzburg State has joined Lower Austria and Upper Austria as the third black-blue coalition provincial government. The ÖVP has four seats in the government, while the FPÖ has three. The current president (speaker) of the Salzburg federal state parliament is Brigitta Pallauf.

<text>Vienna ( ; ; ) is the capital, most populous city, and one of nine federal states of Austria. It is Austria&#x27;s primate city, with just over two million inhabitants. Its larger metropolitan area has a population of nearly 2.9 million, representing nearly one-third of the country&#x27;s population. Vienna is the cultural, economic, and political center of the country, the fifth-largest city by population in the European Union, and the most-populous of the cities on the Danube river.

The city lies on the eastern edge of the Vienna Woods (&quot;Wienerwald&quot;), the northeasternmost foothills of the Alps, that separate Vienna from the more western parts of Austria, at the transition to the Pannonian Basin. It sits on the Danube, and is traversed by the highly regulated Wienfluss (&quot;Vienna River&quot;). Vienna is completely surrounded by Lower Austria, and lies around 50 km (31 mi) west of Slovakia and its capital Bratislava, 60 km (37 mi) northwest of Hungary, and 60 km (37 mi) south of Moravia (Czech Republic).

The once Celtic settlement of &quot;Vedunia&quot; was converted by the Romans into the castrum &quot;Vindobona&quot; (province of Pannonia) in the 1st century, and was elevated to a municipium with Roman city rights in 212. This was followed by a time in the sphere of influence of the Lombards and later the Pannonian Avars, when Slavs formed the majority of the region&#x27;s population. From the 8th century on, the region was settled by the Baiuvarii. In 1155, Vienna became the seat of the Babenbergs, who ruled Austria from 976 to 1246. In 1221, Vienna was granted city rights. During the 16th century, the Habsburgs, who had succeeded the Babenbergs, established Vienna as the seat of the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, a position it held until the empire&#x27;s dissolution in 1806, with only a brief interruption. With the formation of the Austrian Empire in 1804, Vienna became the capital of it and all its successor states.

Throughout the modern era, Vienna has been among the largest German-speaking cities in the world. It was the largest in the 18th and 19th century, peaking at two million inhabitants before it was overtaken by Berlin at the beginning of the 20th century. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations, OPEC and the OSCE. In 2001, the city center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In July 2017, it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger.

Vienna has been called the &quot;City of Music&quot; due to its musical legacy, as many famous classical musicians such as Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Haydn, Mahler, Mozart, Schoenberg, Schubert, Johann Strauss I and Johann Strauss II lived and worked there. It played a pivotal role as a leading European music center, from the age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century. Vienna was home to the world&#x27;s first psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud. The historic center of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque palaces and gardens, and the late-19th-century &quot;Ringstraße&quot;, which is lined with grand buildings, monuments, and parks.

In 2024, Vienna retained its position as most livable city per the Economist Intelligence Unit, and has spent every year since 2015 in the top 2 places, bar 2021 due to the COVID-19 lockdowns.

== Etymology==

The place is mentioned as &quot;Οϋι[νδ]όβονα (Oui[nd]obona)&quot; in the 2nd century AD (Ptolemy, &quot;Geography&quot;, II, 14, 3); &quot;Vindobona&quot; in the 3rd century (&quot;Itinerarium Antonini Augusti&quot; 233, 8); &quot;Vindobona&quot; in the 4th century (, V, 1); &quot;Vindomana&quot; ab. 400 (, 145, 16); &quot;Vindomina, Vendomina&quot; in the 6th century (Jordanes, &quot;De origine actibusque Getarum&quot;, 50, 264).

The English name &quot;Vienna&quot; is borrowed from the homonymous Italian name. The German name comes from the name of the river &quot;Wien&quot;, mentioned &quot;ad UUeniam&quot; in 881 (&quot;Wenia-&quot; in modern writing).

The name of the Roman settlement on the same emplacement is of Celtic extraction , probably meaning &quot;white village, white settlement&quot; from Celtic roots, , meaning &quot;white&quot; (Old Irish &quot;white&quot;, Welsh / , Old Breton &quot;white, bright&quot; &gt; Breton &quot;white&quot;), and &quot;foundation, settlement, village&quot;, related to Old Irish &quot;bun&quot; &quot;base, foundation&quot; and Welsh &quot;bon&quot;, same meaning. The Celtic word may reflect a widespread prehistorical cult of Vindos, a Celtic deity who survives in Irish mythology as the warrior and seer Fionn mac Cumhaill. A variant of this Celtic name could be preserved in the Czech, Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian names of the city (, , and respectively) and in that of the city&#x27;s district Wieden.

The name of the city in Hungarian (), Serbo-Croatian () and Ottoman Turkish (, &quot;Beç&quot;) has a different, probably Slavonic origin, and originally referred to an Avar fort in the area. Slovene speakers call the city , which in other Central European Slavic languages means the river Danube, on which the city stands.

== History==

=== Roman period===

In the 1st century, the Romans set up the military camp of Vindobona in Pannonia on the site of today&#x27;s Vienna city center near the Danube with an adjoining civilian town to secure the borders of the Roman Empire. Construction of the legionary camp began around 97 AD. At its peak, Vindobona had a population of around 15,000 people. It was a part of a trade and communications network across the Empire. Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius may have died here in 180 AD during a campaign against the Marcomanni.

After a Germanic invasion in the second century the city was rebuilt. It served as a seat of the Roman government until the fifth century, when the population fled due to the Huns invasion of Pannonia. The city was abandoned for several centuries.

Evidence of the Romans in the city is plentiful. Remains of the military camp have been found under the city, as well as fragments of the canal system and figurines.

=== Middle Ages ===
Close ties with other Celtic peoples continued through the ages. The Irish monk Saint Colman (or Koloman, Irish &quot;Colmán&quot;, derived from &quot;colm&quot; &quot;dove&quot;) is buried in Melk Abbey and Saint Fergil (Virgil the Geometer) served as Bishop of Salzburg for forty years. Irish Benedictines founded twelfth-century monastic settlements; evidence of these ties persists in the form of Vienna&#x27;s great Schottenstift monastery (Scots Abbey), once home to many Irish monks.
In 976, Leopold I of Babenberg became count of the Eastern March, a district centered on the Danube on the eastern frontier of Bavaria. This initial district grew into the duchy of Austria. Each succeeding Babenberg ruler expanded the march east along the Danube, eventually encompassing Vienna and the lands immediately east. In 1155, Henry II, Duke of Austria moved the Babenberg family residence with the founding of the Schottenstift from Klosterneuburg in Lower Austria to Vienna. From that time, Vienna remained the center of the Babenberg dynasty. Hungary occupied the city between 1485 and 1490.Vienna became at the turn to the 16th century the seat of the Aulic Council and subsequently later in the 16th century of the Habsburg emperors of the Holy Roman Empire with an interruption between at the turn to the 17th century until 1806, becoming an important center in the empire.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Christian forces twice stopped Ottoman armies outside Vienna, in the 1529 siege of Vienna and the 1683 Battle of Vienna. The Great Plague of Vienna ravaged the city in 1679, killing nearly a third of its population.
=== Austrian Empire and early 20th century===

In 1804, during the Napoleonic Wars, Vienna became the capital of the newly formed Austrian Empire. The city continued to play a major role in European and world politics, including hosting the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15. The city also saw major uprisings against Habsburg rule in 1848, which were suppressed. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Vienna remained the capital of what became the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city functioned as a center of classical music, for which the title of the First Viennese School (Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven) is sometimes applied.During the latter half of the 19th century, Vienna developed what had previously been the bastions and glacis into the &quot;Ringstraße&quot;, a new boulevard surrounding the historical town and a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of Vienna grew dramatically. In 1918, after World War I, Vienna became capital of the Republic of German-Austria, and then in 1919 of the First Republic of Austria.

From the late-19th century to 1938, the city remained a center of high culture and of modernism. A world capital of music, Vienna played host to composers such as Johannes Brahms, Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, and Richard Strauss.
The city&#x27;s cultural contributions in the first half of the 20th century included, among many, the Vienna Secession movement in art, the Second Viennese School, the architecture of Adolf Loos, the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the Vienna Circle.

===Red Vienna===
The city of Vienna became the center of socialist politics from 1919 to 1934, a period referred to as Red Vienna (&quot;Das rote Wien&quot;). After a new breed of socialist politicians won the local elections they engaged in a brief but ambitious municipal experiment. Social democrats had won an absolute majority in the May 1919 municipal election and commanded the city council with 100 of the 165 seats. Jakob Reumann was appointed by the city council as city mayor. The theoretical foundations of so-called Austromarxism were established by Otto Bauer, Karl Renner, and Max Adler.

Red Vienna is perhaps most well known for its &quot;Gemeindebauten&quot;, public housing buildings. Between 1925 and 1934, over 60,000 new apartments were built in the Gemeindebauten. Apartments were assigned on the basis of a point system favoring families and less affluent citizens.

=== July Revolt and Civil War ===

In July 1927, after three nationalist far-right paramilitary members were acquitted of the killing of two social democratic &quot;Republikanischer Schutzbund&quot; members, a riot broke out in the city. The protestors, enraged by the decision, set the Palace of Justice ablaze. The police attempted to end the revolt with force and killed at least 84 protestors, with 5 policemen also dying. In 1933, right-wing Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss dissolved the parliament, essentially letting him run the country as a dictatorship, banned the Communist Party and severely limited the influence of the Social Democratic Party. This led to a civil war between the right-wing government and socialist forces the following year, which started in Linz and quickly spread to Vienna. Socialist members of the &quot;Republikanischer Schutzbund&quot; barricaded themselves inside the housing estates and exchanged fire with the police and paramilitary groups. The fighting in Vienna ended after the Austrian Armed Forces shelled the Karl-Marx-Hof, a civilian housing estate, and the &quot;Schutzbund&quot; surrendered.

=== Anschluss and World War II===
On 15 March 1938, three days after German troops had first entered Austria, Adolf Hitler arrived in Vienna. 200,000 Austrians greeted him at the Heldenplatz, where he held a speech from a balcony in the Neue Burg, in which he announced that Austria would be absorbed into Nazi Germany. The persecution of Jews started almost immediately, Viennese Jews were harassed and hounded, their homes and businesses plundered. Some were forced to scrub pro-independence slogans off the streets. This culminated in the Kristallnacht, a nationwide pogrom against the Jews carried out by the Schutzstaffel and the Sturmabteilung, with support of the Hitler Youth and German civilians. All synagogues and prayer houses in the city were destroyed, bar the Stadttempel, due to its proximity to residential buildings. Vienna lost its status as a capital to Berlin, as Austria had ceased to exist. The few resistors in the city were arrested.

Adolf Eichmann held office in the expropriated Palais Rothschild and organized the expropriation and persecution of the Jews. Of the almost 200,000 Jews in Vienna, around 120,000 were driven to emigrate and around 65,000 were killed. After the end of the war, the Jewish population of Vienna was only about 5,000.

In 1942 the city suffered its first air raid, carried out by the Soviet air force. Only after the Allies had taken Italy did the next raids commence. From 17 March 1944, 51 air raids were carried out in Vienna. Targets of the bombings were primarily the city&#x27;s oil refineries. However, around a third of the city center was destroyed, and culturally important buildings such as the State Opera and the Burgtheater were burned, and the Albertina was heavily damaged. These air raids lasted until March 1945, just before the Soviet troops started the Vienna offensive.

The Red Army, who had previously marched through Hungary, first entered Vienna on 6 April. They first attacked the eastern and southern suburbs, before moving on to the western suburbs. By the 8th they had the center of the city surrounded. The following day the Soviets started with the infiltration of the city center. Fighting continued for a few more days until the Soviet Navy’s Danube Flotilla naval force arrived with reinforcements. The remaining defending soldiers surrendered that same day.
=== Four-power Vienna===
After the war, Vienna was part of Soviet-occupied Eastern Austria until September 1945. That month, Vienna was divided into sectors by the four powers: the US, the UK, France, and the Soviet Union and supervised by an Allied Commission. The four-power occupation of Vienna differed in one key respect from that of Berlin: the central area of the city, known as the first district, constituted an &quot;international zone&quot; in which the four powers alternated control on a monthly basis. The city was policed by the four powers on a day-to-day basis using the &quot;four soldiers in a jeep&quot; method, which had one soldier from each nation sitting together. The four powers all had separate headquarters, the Soviets in Palais Epstein next to the Parliament, the French in Hotel Kummer on Mariahilferstraße, the Americans in the National Bank, and the British in Schönnbrunn Palace. The division of the city was not comparable to that of Berlin. Although the borders between the sectors were marked, travel between them was freely possible.

During the ten years of the four-power occupation, Vienna was a hotbed for international espionage between the Western and Eastern blocs, which deeply distrusted each other. The city experienced an economic upturn due to the Marshall Plan.

The atmosphere of four-power Vienna is the background for Graham Greene&#x27;s screenplay for the film &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949). The film&#x27;s theme music was composed and performed by Viennese musician Anton Karas using a zither. Later he adapted the screenplay as a novel and published it. Occupied Vienna is also depicted in the 1991 Philip Kerr novel, &quot;A German Requiem&quot;.

=== Austrian State Treaty and subsequent sovereignty ===
The four-power control of Vienna lasted until the Austrian State Treaty was signed in May 1955 and came into force on 27 July 1955. By October, all soldiers had left the country. That year, after years of reconstruction and restoration, the State Opera and the Burgtheater, both on the &quot;Ringstraße&quot; reopened to the public.

In the Autumn of 1956, Vienna accepted many Hungarian refugees, who had fled Hungary after an attempted revolution. The city experienced another wave of refugees after the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968, as well as after the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991.

In 1972 the construction of the &quot;Donauinsel and&quot; the excavation of the New Danube began. In the same decade, Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky inaugurated the Vienna International Centre, a new area of the city created to host international institutions. Vienna has regained much of its former international stature by hosting international organisations, such as the United Nations.

== Demographics==
Because of the industrialization and migration from other parts of the Empire, the population of Vienna increased sharply during its time as the capital of Austria-Hungary (1867–1918). In 1910, Vienna had more than two million inhabitants and was the third largest city in Europe after London and Paris. Around the start of the 20th century, Vienna was the city with the second-largest Czech population in the world (after Prague). After World War I, many Czechs and Hungarians returned to their ancestral countries, resulting in a decline in the Viennese population. After World War II, the Soviets used force to repatriate key workers of Czech, Slovak and Hungarian origins to return to their ethnic homelands to further the Soviet bloc economy. The population of Vienna generally stagnated or declined through the remainder of the 20th century, not demonstrating significant growth again until the census of 2000. In 2020, Vienna&#x27;s population remained significantly below its reported peak in 1916.

Under the Nazi regime, 65,000 Jews were deported and murdered in concentration camps by Nazi forces; approximately 130,000 fled.

By 2001, 16% of people living in Austria had nationalities other than Austrian, nearly half of whom were from former Yugoslavia; the next most numerous nationalities in Vienna were Turks (39,000; 2.5%), Poles (13,600; 0.9%) and Germans (12,700; 0.8%).

, an official report from Statistics Austria showed that more than 660,000 (38.8%) of the Viennese population have full or partial migrant background, mostly from Ex-Yugoslavia, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Romania and Hungary.

From 2005 to 2015 the city&#x27;s population grew by 10.1%. According to UN-Habitat, Vienna could be the fastest growing city out of 17 European metropolitan areas until 2025 with an increase of 4.65% of its population, compared to 2010.

=== Religion===
According to the 2021 census, 49.0% of Viennese were Christian. Among them, 31.8% were Catholic, 11.2% were Eastern Orthodox, and 3.7% were Protestant, mostly Lutheran, 34.1% had no religious affiliation, 14.8% were Muslim, and 2% were of other religions, including Jewish. One sources estimates that Vienna&#x27;s Jewish community is of 8,000 members meanwhile another suggest 15,000.

Based on information provided to city officials by various religious organizations about their membership, Vienna&#x27;s Statistical Yearbook 2019 reports in 2018 an estimated 610,269 Roman Catholics, or 32.3% of the population, and 200,000 (10.4%) Muslims, 70,298 (3.7%) Orthodox, 57,502 (3.0%) other Christians, and 9,504 (0.5%) other religions. A study conducted by the Vienna Institute of Demography estimated the 2018 proportions to be 34% Catholic, 30% unaffiliated, 15% Muslim, 10% Orthodox, 4% Protestant, and 6% other religions.

As of the spring of 2014, Muslims made up 30% of the total proportion of schoolchildren in Vienna.

Vienna is the seat of the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna, in which is also vested the exempt Ordinariate for Byzantine-Rite Catholics in Austria; its Archbishop is Cardinal Christoph Schönborn. Many Catholic Churches in central Vienna feature performances of religious or other music, including masses sung to classical music and organ. Some of Vienna&#x27;s most significant historical buildings are Catholic churches, including the St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral (&quot;Stephansdom&quot;), Karlskirche, Peterskirche and the Votivkirche. On the banks of the Danube is a Buddhist Peace Pagoda, built in 1983 by the monks and nuns of Nipponzan Myohoji.

== Geography ==

Vienna is located in northeastern Austria, at the easternmost extension of the Alps in the Vienna Basin. The earliest settlement, at the location of today&#x27;s inner city, was south of the meandering Danube while the city now spans both sides of the river. Elevation ranges from . The city has a total area of 414.78 square kilometers (160.1 sq mi), making it the largest city in Austria by area.

=== Climate ===
Whereas the higher elevated north/western edges of Vienna have a borderline oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) and humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), most parts of the urban core are warm enough for a humid subtropical (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) classification with dozens of days exceeding and night temperatures not dropping below .

The city has warm to hot showery summers, with average high temperatures ranging between and a record maximum exceeding . Winters are relatively dry and cool to cold with daily mean temperatures at or well above freezing point. Spring is variable and autumn cool, with a chance of snow in or after November. Snowfall and frequent frost have become rare though in the last decades, with snow cover mostly ranging from zero to a few inches for a short period of time.

Precipitation is generally moderate throughout the year, averaging around annually, with considerable local variations, the Vienna Woods region in the west being the wettest part ( annually) and the flat plains in the east being the driest part ( annually). Snow in winter is not common anymore and not so frequent compared to the mostly alpine Western and Southern regions of Austria.


== Districts and enlargement==

=== Districts ===

Vienna is divided into 23 districts (German: &quot;Bezirke&quot;). Each district has both a name and a corresponding number. These numbers are displayed on every street sign before the street name (e.g., 16., Thaliastraße). They also serve as the second and third digits of the postcode (1010 for the 1st district to 1230 for the 23rd district).

Residents of the districts (Austrians as well as EU citizens) elect the district assembly to a five year term. The elections take place concurrently with the state election. Any decision taken by the district can be overridden by the city assembly or the responsible city councilor.
=== Enlargement ===

The heart and historical city of Vienna, a large part of today&#x27;s Innere Stadt, was a fortress surrounded by fields to defend itself from potential attackers. In 1850, with the emperor&#x27;s consent, Vienna annexed 34 surrounding villages into the city limits. Following this expansion the walls were taken down, allowing the city center to expand.

In its place, a broad boulevard called the &quot;Ringstraße&quot; was built, along which grand public and private buildings, monuments and parks were constructed by the early 20th century. These buildings include the Rathaus, Burgtheater, University, Parliament, the twin museums of natural history and fine art, and the Staatsoper. It is also the location of the New Wing of the Hofburg, the former imperial palace, and the Imperial and Royal War Ministry finished in 1913. The mainly Gothic Stephansdom is located at the center of the city, on Stephansplatz. The Imperial-Royal Government set up the Vienna City Renovation Fund (Wiener Stadterneuerungsfonds) and sold many building lots to private investors, thereby partly financing public construction works.

From 1850 to 1890, city limits in the West and the South mainly followed another wall called &quot;Linienwall&quot; at which a road toll called the &quot;Liniengeld&quot; was charged. Outside this wall from 1873 onwards a ring road called &quot;The Gürtel&quot; was built. In 1890 it was decided to integrate 33 suburbs (called Vororte) beyond that wall into Vienna by 1 January 1892 and transform them into districts no. 11 to 19 (district no. 10 had been constituted in 1874); hence the Linienwall was torn down beginning in 1894. In 1900, district no. 20, Brigittenau, was created by separating the area from the 2nd district.

From 1850 to 1904, Vienna had expanded only on the eastern bank of the Danube, following the main branch before the regulation of 1868–1875, i.e., the Old Danube of today. In 1904, the 21st district was created by integrating Floridsdorf, Kagran, Stadlau, Hirschstetten, Aspern and other villages on the left bank of the Danube into Vienna, and in 1910 Strebersdorf followed. On 15 October 1938, the Nazis created Great Vienna with 26 districts by merging 97 towns and villages into Vienna, 80 of which were returned to surrounding Lower Austria in 1954. Since then Vienna has had 23 districts.

Industries are located mostly in the southern and eastern districts. The Innere Stadt is situated away from the main flow of the Danube, but is bounded by the &quot;Donaukanal&quot; (&quot;Danube canal&quot;).

Across the Danube, where the Vienna International Centre is located (districts 21–22), and in the southern areas (district 23) are the newest parts of the city.

== Politics==
===Political history===
In the provinces represented in the Imperial Council, men had enjoyed universal suffrage at the national level since 1907. However, Mayor Karl Lueger of the Christian Social Party prevented the adoption of this right to vote in municipal council elections, effectively excluding many working-class people. The first elections in which all adult men and women were entitled to vote took place in 1919, after the end of the monarchy. Since 1919, the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) has consistently provided the mayor in all free elections, and the Vienna City Council (the city parliament) has maintained a Social Democratic majority.

On 10 November 1920, the Federal Constitution of Austria came into force. This constitution defined Vienna as a separate federal state, enabling its separation from Lower Austria. Since then, the mayor of Vienna has also served as the governor of the state, the city senate has functioned as the state government and the municipal council the state parliament. Vienna continued to serve as the seat of the Lower Austrian government until 1997, when it relocated to St. Pölten.

From 1934 to 1945, during the Austrofascist and Nazi periods, no democratic elections were held, and the city was governed under a dictatorship. During this time, the SPÖ was banned, and many of its members were imprisoned. Vienna&#x27;s city constitution was reinstated in 1945.

The city has enacted numerous social democratic policies. One notable example is the Gemeindebauten, social housing assets that are well-integrated into the city&#x27;s architecture outside the inner district. These low-cost rentals provide comfortable accommodation and good access to city amenities. Many of the projects were built after World War II on vacant lots left by bombings during the war, with a strong emphasis on high construction standards. Today, Vienna&#x27;s social housing accommodates over 500,000 people.

===Government===
In the 1996 City Council election, the SPÖ lost its overall majority in the 100-seat chamber, winning 43 seats and 39.15% of the vote. The SPÖ had previously held an outright majority in every free municipal election since 1919. In the same election, the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) won 29 seats, an increase from 21 in 1991, and surpassed the ÖVP, who finished in third place for the second consecutive election. From 1996 to 2001, the SPÖ governed Vienna in a coalition with the ÖVP.

In 2001, the SPÖ regained their overall majority with 52 seats and 46.91% of the vote. In 2005, this majority increased further to 55 seats (49.09%). However, in the 2010 elections, the SPÖ lost their overall majority again and subsequently formed a coalition with the Green Party – the first SPÖ/Green coalition in Austria. This coalition remained in place following the 2015 election.

After the 2020 election, the SPÖ formed a coalition with NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum. The next elections are scheduled to take place on 27 April 2025.

==== Current government ====

The latest elections were held on 11 October 2020. It resulted in an SPÖ-NEOS coalition and Michael Ludwig was re-elected as mayor.

Notable Viennese balls include the Vienna Opera Ball, the Vienna Ball of Sciences, the Wiener Akademikerball and the Hofburg Silvesterball.

The Wiener Akademikerball in the Hofburg has attracted lots of controversy for being a gathering for far-right politicians and groups. The ball is hosted by the FPÖ, the right-wing populist party of Austria and has attracted multiple right-wing and far-right personalities, such as Martin Sellner and Marine Le Pen. Since 2008, annual demonstrations organized by various groups have protested against the event. Former leader of the FPÖ Heinz-Christian Strache compared anti-fascist protesters to a Nazi mob, alleging that the ball attendees were being treated as &quot;new Jews&quot;.

On the southeastern outer border of the &quot;Ringstraße&quot; lies the Stadtpark. The park covers an area of about 28 acres and is split in half by the Wien river. It contains monuments to various Viennese artists, most notably the gilded bronze monument of Johann Strauß II. On the other side of the Ring is the Burggarten, just behind the Hofburg, which features a monument to Mozart as well as a greenhouse. On the other side of the Hofburg is the Volksgarten, home to a small-scale replica of the Temple of Hephaestus and a cultivated flower garden. On the other side of the road, in front of the Rathaus, is the Rathauspark, which hosts the Christmas Christkindlmarkt.

The Prater is a large public park in Leopoldstadt. Within the park is the Wurstelprater (colloquially known as “the Prater”), a public amusement park that contains the Wiener Riesenrad, a 64.75 meter tall Ferris Wheel, along with various rides, roller coasters, carousels and a Madame Tussauds. The rest of the park is covered by forest. The &quot;Hauptallee&quot;, a wide, car-free alley lined with horse chestnut trees, runs through the park. Eliud Kipchoge broke the marathon distance record on this road in the INEOS 1:59 Challenge in October 2019. The Prater also is home to the Liliputbahn, a railway line primarily used by tourists, and a planetarium. It was the location of the 1873 Vienna World&#x27;s Fair. In 1931, the Ernst-Happel-Stadion, formerly known as the Praterstadion, was opened in the Prater.

The park was created in 1561 by Emperor Ferdinand I, who used it as a private hunting ground. After the fall of the monarchy, the Austrian government declared it a public nature reserve. Since 1973, admission has been free of charge. The reserve is home to many wild boar, fallow deer, red deer, European mouflons, as well as 18 species of bats.

The grounds of the imperial Schönbrunn Palace contain an 18th-century park which includes the Schönbrunn Zoo, which was founded in 1752, making it the world&#x27;s oldest zoo still in operation. The zoo is one of the few to house giant pandas. The park also features the Palmenhaus Schönbrunn, a large greenhouse with around 4,500 plant species.

The Augarten in Leopoldstadt, on the border of Brigittenau, is a 129-acre French Baroque-style public park open during the day. The park is home to flower gardens and multiple tree-lined avenues. The park was opened in 1775 by Joseph II and is surrounded by a wall with five gates, which are shut at night. The baroque Palais Augarten, in the south of the park, is home to the Vienna Boys&#x27; Choir. Towering over the park are two anti-aircraft flak towers, built by the Nazis in 1944. After the war, as the towers were unable to be destroyed, so they were left standing. They now stand empty and serve no function, though various other such towers in the city were repurposed, such as the Haus des Meeres in Esterhazy Park.

The Donauinsel, part of Vienna&#x27;s flood defences, is a long artificial island between the Danube and New Danube dedicated to leisure activities. It was constructed from 1972 to 1988 for flood protection measures. Sporting amenities, such as volleyball courts, playgrounds, skate spots, dog parks, and multiple toilet facilities, some with showers, are available on the island. To transform the island into a green space, approximately 1.8 million trees and shrubs, along with 170 hectares of forest, were planted. A few hundred Japanese cherry trees were planted as a symbol of friendship between Austria and Japan. Animals on the island include sand lizards and Danube crested newts.

The Donaupark is a 63-hectare park in Kaisermühlen, Donaustadt, between the New Danube and the Old Danube, next to the Vienna International Centre. The park features the Donauturm, the tallest structure in Austria at 252 meters, as well as a 40-meter tall steel cross, erected in 1983 on the occasion of a holy mass held by Pope John Paul II during his visit to Austria. The park features memorials to multiple Latin American figures such as Salvador Allende, Simón Bolívar, and Che Guevara.

Other parks include the Türkenschanzpark, the Schweizergarten, and the Waldmüllerpark.

St. Marx Cemetery, now closed, is the final resting place of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Other notable cemeteries include those in Grinzing and Hietzing, as well as the Jewish Cemetery in Roßau.

== Danube ==
Vienna is the largest city on the Danube, which flows from the north through the city and exits to the southeast. In Vienna, the river is split into four parts:

* The main Danube is the widest of these and is primarily used for shipping.
* The Neue Donau (New Danube) is a side channel located to the east of the main river. Constructed in 1972 as part of flood protection measures, it is separated from the Danube by the artificial Donauinsel. It runs for approximately 21 kilometers. The water flows more slowly than in the main Danube, making it suitable for water sports such as swimming, rowing, and sailing. Motorboats are prohibited in this section. 
* The Alte Donau (Old Danube) is a lake to the east of the New Danube, effectively cutting off Kaisermühlen from the rest of the city. The lake is a popular destination for swimmers, featuring freely accessible piers and beaches. Motorboats and pedalos are permitted on the lake and can be rented from nearby vendors.
* The Donaukanal (Danube Canal) branches off and rejoins the Danube close to the southern and northern edges of the city. Unlike the main river, it flows through the city center. While the waterway is primarily used by boats, the paths along both sides of the Donaukanal are popular among pedestrians, joggers, and cyclists.

== Sport ==

=== Football ===

The city is home to numerous football clubs. The two biggest teams are FK Austria Wien (21 Austrian Bundesliga titles and a record 27-time cup winners), who play at the Generali Arena in Favoriten, and SK Rapid Wien (a record 32 Austrian Bundesliga titles), who play at the Allianz Stadion in Penzing. The oldest team in Austria, First Vienna FC, and Floridsdorfer AC both play in the 2. Liga, while the football team of the Wiener Sport-Club, one of the oldest athletics clubs in the country, play in the Austrian Regionalliga East, the third division. 
The Ernst-Happel-Stadion is the largest stadium in Austria with 50,865 seats, and serves as the home stadium of the Austria national football team. It has hosted multiple European Cup finals (1963–64, 1986–87, 1989–90, 1994–95), as well as seven matches during the 2008 European Championship, including the final, which saw Spain secure a 1–0 victory over Germany.

=== Other sports ===
Other sports clubs include the Vikings Vienna (American football), who won the Eurobowl title four times in a row between 2004 and 2007 and had a perfect season in 2013, the Hotvolleys Vienna (volleyball), the Vienna Wanderers (baseball), who won the 2012 and 2013 Championship of the Austrian Baseball League, and the Vienna Capitals (ice hockey). The European Handball Federation (EHF) is headquartered in Vienna. There are also three rugby clubs in the city: Vienna Celtic, the oldest rugby club in Austria, RC Donau, and Stade Viennois.
In addition to team sports, Vienna offers a wide range of individual sports. The paths in the Prater or along the Donauinsel are popular running routes. The Vienna City Marathon, which attracts more than 10,000 participants annually, typically takes place in May. Cyclists can choose from over 1,000 kilometers of cycle paths and numerous mountain bike trails in the Viennese mountains. Golf courses are available on the Wienerberg and in the Prater. The Vienna Open tennis tournament has taken place in the city since 1974. The matches are played on indoor hard courts in the Wiener Stadthalle. The City of Vienna also operates two ski slopes, one on the Hohe-Wand-Wiese and another on the Dollwiese.

The city submitted a bid to host the 1964 Summer Olympics but lost out to Tokyo.

== Culinary specialities==
=== Food ===

Vienna is well known for Wiener schnitzel, a cutlet of veal &quot;(Kalbsschnitzel)&quot;, sometimes also made with pork (&quot;Schweinsschnitzel&quot;) or chicken (&quot;Hühnerschnitzel&quot;), that is pounded flat, coated in flour, egg, and breadcrumbs, and fried in clarified butter. It is available in almost every restaurant that serves Viennese cuisine and can be eaten hot or cold. Other examples of Viennese cuisine include &quot;Tafelspitz&quot; (very lean boiled beef), which is traditionally served with &quot;Geröstete Erdäpfel&quot; (boiled potatoes that are sliced and pan-fried) and horseradish sauce, &quot;Apfelkren&quot; (a mixture of horseradish, cream and apple) and &quot;Schnittlauchsauce&quot; (a chives sauce made with mayonnaise and stale bread).

Vienna has a long tradition of producing cakes and desserts. These include &quot;Apfelstrudel&quot; (hot apple strudel), &quot;Milchrahmstrudel&quot; (milk-cream strudel), &quot;Palatschinken&quot; (sweet pancakes), and &quot;Knödel&quot; (dumplings) often filled with fruit such as apricots (&quot;Marillenknödel&quot;). Sachertorte, a delicately moist chocolate cake with a layer of apricot jam and a chocolate glaze, created by the Sacher Hotel, is world-famous.

In winter, small street stands sell traditional &quot;Maroni&quot; (hot chestnuts) and potato fritters.

Sausages are popular and available from street vendors (&quot;Würstelstand&quot;) throughout the day and into the night. The sausage known as &quot;Wiener&quot; (German for Viennese) in the U.S. and in Germany is called a &quot;Frankfurter&quot; in Vienna. Other popular sausages are &quot;Burenwurst&quot; (a coarse beef and pork sausage, generally boiled), &quot;Käsekrainer&quot; (spicy pork with small chunks of cheese), and &quot;Bratwurst&quot; (a white pork sausage). Theese sausages either come with sliced bread or as a hot dog. Mustard is the traditional condiment and usually offered in two varieties: &quot;süß&quot; (sweet) or &quot;scharf&quot; (spicy).

Vienna ranked 10th in vegan friendly European cities in a study by Alternative Traveler in 2020.

The Naschmarkt is a permanent market for fruit, vegetables, spices, fish, and meat, as well as a popular spot for international cuisine, with numerous small restaurants and food stalls offering dishes from around the world.

=== Drinks ===

Vienna is one of the few remaining world capitals with its own vineyards. The wine is served in small Viennese pubs known as Heuriger. The wine is often enjoyed as a Spritzer (&quot;G&#x27;spritzter&quot;) with sparkling water. The Grüner Veltliner, a dry white wine, is the most widely cultivated wine in Austria. Another wine typical of the region is &quot;Gemischter Satz&quot;, which is usually a blend of different grape varieties harvested from the same vineyard.

Beer is second in importance to wine. Vienna has a single large brewery, Ottakringer, and more than ten microbreweries. Ottakringer&#x27;s most popular product is the &quot;Ottakringer Helles&quot;, a beer with an alcohol content of 5.2%. A Beisl is a traditional small Austrian pub, and Vienna is home to many of them.

Local soft drinks, such as Almdudler, are popular across the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages, ranking them among the top choices alongside American brands like Coca-Cola in terms of market share. Other popular drinks include Spezi, a mix between cola and orange lemonade, and Frucade, a German carbonated orange drink.

=== Viennese cafés ===

The Viennese coffee house (&quot;Kaffeehaus&quot;) dates back to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Vienna intelligentsia treated Viennese cafés like a living room. The first Viennese café was opened in 1685 by an Armenian businessman named Johannes Diodato. Café culture flourished in Vienna in the early 19th century. Notable patrons included political figures such as Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Leon Trotsky, and Josip Broz Tito, who all lived in Vienna in 1913, as well as scientists, writers, and artists such as Sigmund Freud, Stefan Zweig, Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt.

Notable coffee houses include:

* Café Central: frequented by Hitler, Stalin, Tito, Trotsky and Zweig
* Café Landtmann: frequented by Freud
* Café Sacher: part of the Hotel Sacher

=== Heuriger ===

Vienna is one of the few major cities with its own wine-growing region. This wine is sold in taverns, so-called &quot;Heuriger&quot;, by the local winemakers during the growing season. The wine is often served as a Schorle, a mix of wine and carbonated water. The meals are simple and homemade, usually consisting of fresh bread, typically semmels, with local coldcuts and cheese, or Liptauer spread. The Heurigers are especially numerous in the areas of Döbling (Grinzing, Neustift am Walde, Nußdorf, Salmannsdorf, Sievering), Floridsdorf (Stammersdorf, Strebersdorf), Liesing (Mauer), and Favoriten (Oberlaa).

== Transport==
=== Public transport ===
Vienna has an extensive public transportation network. It consists predominantly of the Wiener Linien network (subway, tram and bus lines) and the S-Bahn lines belonging to the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). As of 2023, 32% of the population of the city uses public transit as their main mode of transit.

==== U-Bahn ====
The Vienna metro system consists of five lines (U1, U2, U3, U4, U6) with the U5 currently under construction. The metro currently serves 98 stations and covers a distance of 83.5 kilometers.
The services run from 05:00 to about 01:00 with intervals of two to five minutes during the day and up to eight minutes after 20:00. On Friday and Saturday evenings and on evenings before a public holiday they operate a 24-hour service at 15-minute intervals.

==== Buses ====

Buses were first introduced to the city in 1907. Currently, 117 bus lines operate in Vienna during the day. 47 of these are run by the Wiener Linien, who also set the routes and timetables, the rest by subcontractors such as &quot;Dr. Richard&quot;, &quot;Gschwindl&quot; and &quot;Blaguss&quot;. The Wiener Linien also operate 20 night buses.

==== Trams ====

The Viennese tram network has existed since 1865; the first line was electrified in 1897. There are currently 28 lines with 1071 stops that operate on a network of 176,9 km. The trams move at about 15 km/h. The fleet consists of both high-floor and low-floor vehicles, however the high-floor models, which are not air-conditioned, are in the process of being replaced by more modern, accessible trams. The modern models are air-conditioned and suitable for disabled users.

==== Trains ====

The city forms the hub of the Austrian railway system, with services to all parts of the country and abroad. The railway system connects Vienna&#x27;s main station Vienna Hauptbahnhof with other European cities, including Bratislava, Budapest, Ljubljana, Munich, Prague, Venice, Wrocław, Warsaw, Zagreb, and Zürich. Other train stations include:

* Wien Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof, the starting point of the Franz-Josefs-Bahn
* Wien Hütteldorf on the Western railway
* Wien Meidling on the Southern railway. This is Vienna&#x27;s most frequented transit station.
* Wien Mitte (Landstraße) on the S-Bahn line; it is the closest railway station to the center of the city.
* Wien Praterstern (Formerly known as Wien Nord or Wien Nord-Praterstern) on the Northern railway
* Wien Westbahnhof, starting point of the Western railway

=== Cycling ===

The cycling network in the city spans 1,721 kilometers. However, this figure counts bidirectional bike paths twice and includes on-road cycle-lanes, which are also shared with motor vehicles. The network is constantly being expanded and upgraded, especially in the outer areas, such as Donaustadt. Bike use in the city has been rising, from just 3% in 1993 to 10% in 2023.

The city also operates a bicycle-sharing system called &quot;WienMobil Radverleih&quot;, which offers 3,000 bikes stationed across 185 stations, available at all times. The bikes are 7-speed city bikes with an adjustable saddle.

=== Airport ===

Vienna is served by Vienna International Airport, located 18 km southeast of the city center near the town of Schwechat. The airport handled approximately 29.5 million passengers in 2023. Following lengthy negotiations with surrounding communities, the airport is set to be expanded to increase its capacity by adding a third runway. The airport is undergoing a major expansion, including a new terminal building that opened in 2012 to accommodate the growing number of passengers. Another option for travelers is to use Bratislava Airport, Slovakia, located approximately 60 km away.

<text>Classical logic (or standard logic) or Frege–Russell logic is the intensively studied and most widely used class of deductive logic. Classical logic has had much influence on analytic philosophy.

==Characteristics==

Each logical system in this class shares characteristic properties:
# Law of excluded middle and double negation elimination
# Law of noncontradiction, and the principle of explosion
# Monotonicity of entailment and idempotency of entailment
# Commutativity of conjunction
# De Morgan duality: every logical operator is dual to another

While not entailed by the preceding conditions, contemporary discussions of classical logic normally only include propositional and first-order logics. In other words, the overwhelming majority of time spent studying classical logic has been spent studying specifically propositional and first-order logic, as opposed to the other forms of classical logic.

Most semantics of classical logic are bivalent, meaning all of the possible denotations of propositions can be categorized as either true or false.

==History==

Classical logic is a 19th and 20th-century innovation. The name does not refer to classical antiquity, which used the term logic of Aristotle. Classical logic was the reconciliation of Aristotle&#x27;s logic, which dominated most of the last 2000 years, with the propositional Stoic logic. The two were sometimes seen as irreconcilable.

Leibniz&#x27;s calculus ratiocinator can be seen as foreshadowing classical logic. Bernard Bolzano has the understanding of existential import found in classical logic and not in Aristotle. Though he never questioned Aristotle, George Boole&#x27;s algebraic reformulation of logic, so-called Boolean logic, was a predecessor of modern mathematical logic and classical logic. William Stanley Jevons and John Venn, who also had the modern understanding of existential import, expanded Boole&#x27;s system.

The original first-order, classical logic is found in Gottlob Frege&#x27;s &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot;. It has a wider application than Aristotle&#x27;s logic and is capable of expressing Aristotle&#x27;s logic as a special case. It explains the quantifiers in terms of mathematical functions. It was also the first logic capable of dealing with the problem of multiple generality, for which Aristotle&#x27;s system was impotent. Frege, who is considered the founder of analytic philosophy, invented it to show all of mathematics was derivable from logic, and make arithmetic rigorous as David Hilbert had done for geometry, the doctrine is known as logicism in the foundations of mathematics. The notation Frege used never much caught on. Hugh MacColl published a variant of propositional logic two years prior.

The writings of Augustus De Morgan and Charles Sanders Peirce also pioneered classical logic with the logic of relations. Peirce influenced Giuseppe Peano and Ernst Schröder.

Classical logic reached fruition in Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, and Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus Logico Philosophicus&quot;. Russell and Whitehead were influenced by Peano (it uses his notation) and Frege and sought to show mathematics was derived from logic. Wittgenstein was influenced by Frege and Russell and initially considered the &quot;Tractatus&quot; to have solved all problems of philosophy.

Willard Van Orman Quine believed that a formal system that allows quantification over predicates (higher-order logic) didn&#x27;t meet the requirements to be a logic, saying that it was &quot;set theory in disguise&quot;.

Classical logic is the standard logic of mathematics. Many mathematical theorems rely on classical rules of inference such as disjunctive syllogism and the double negation elimination. The adjective &quot;classical&quot; in logic is not related to the use of the adjective &quot;classical&quot; in physics, which has another meaning. In logic, &quot;classical&quot; simply means &quot;standard&quot;. Classical logic should also not be confused with term logic, also known as Aristotelian logic.

Jan Łukasiewicz pioneered non-classical logic.

==Generalized semantics==

With the advent of algebraic logic, it became apparent that classical propositional calculus admits other semantics. In Boolean-valued semantics (for classical propositional logic), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary Boolean algebra; &quot;true&quot; corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, and &quot;false&quot; corresponds to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. The principle of bivalence holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the two-element algebra, which has no intermediate elements.

<doc id="55870" wikidata="Q128430" url="?curid=55870" title="Cyclopes">
<text>In Greek mythology and later Roman mythology, the Cyclopes ( ; , &quot;Kýklōpes&quot;, &quot;Circle-eyes&quot; or &quot;Round-eyes&quot;; singular Cyclops ; , &quot;Kýklōps&quot;) are giant one-eyed creatures. Three groups of Cyclopes can be distinguished. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, the Cyclopes are the three brothers, Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, who made Zeus&#x27;s weapon, the thunderbolt. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, they are an uncivilized group of shepherds, the brethren of Polyphemus encountered by Odysseus. Cyclopes were also famous for being the builders of the Cyclopean walls of Mycenae and Tiryns.

In &quot;Cyclops&quot;, the fifth-century BC play by Euripides, a chorus of satyrs offers comic relief based on the encounter of Odysseus and Polyphemus. The third-century BC poet Callimachus makes the Hesiodic Cyclopes the assistants of smith-god Hephaestus, as does Virgil in the Latin epic &quot;Aeneid&quot;, where he seems to equate the Hesiodic and Homeric Cyclopes.

From at least the fifth century BC, Cyclopes have been associated with the island of Sicily and the volcanic Aeolian Islands.

==Kinds==
Three groups of Cyclopes can be distinguished: the Hesiodic, the Homeric and the wall-builders. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, the Cyclopes are the three brothers: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, sons of Uranus and Gaia, who made for Zeus his characteristic weapon, the thunderbolt. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the Cyclopes are an uncivilized group of shepherds, one of whom, Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon, is encountered by Odysseus. Cyclopes were also said to have been the builders of the Cyclopean walls of Mycenae and Tiryns. A scholiast, quoting the fifth-century BC historian Hellanicus, tells us that, in addition to the Hesiodic Cyclopes (whom the scholiast describes as &quot;the gods themselves&quot;), and the Homeric Cyclopes, there was a third group of Cyclopes: the builders of the walls of Mycenae.

===Hesiodic Cyclopes===
Hesiod, in the &quot;Theogony&quot; (c. 700 BC), described three Cyclopes: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, who were the sons of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), and the brothers of the Titans and Hundred-Handers, and who had a single eye set in the middle of their foreheads. They made for Zeus his all-powerful thunderbolt, and in so doing, the Cyclopes played a key role in the Greek succession myth, which told how the Titan Cronus overthrew his father Uranus, and how in turn Zeus overthrew Cronus and his fellow Titans, and how Zeus was eventually established as the final and permanent ruler of the cosmos. The names that Hesiod gives them: Arges (Bright), Brontes (Thunder), and Steropes (Lightning), reflect their fundamental role as thunderbolt makers. As early as the late seventh-century BC, the Cyclopes could be used by the Spartan poet Tyrtaeus to epitomize extraordinary size and strength.

According to the accounts of Hesiod and the mythographer Apollodorus, the Cyclopes had been imprisoned by their father Uranus. Zeus later freed the Cyclopes, and they repaid him by giving him the thunderbolt. The Cyclopes provided for Hesiod, and other theogony-writers, a convenient source of heavenly weaponry, since the smith-god Hephaestus—who would eventually take over that role—had not yet been born. According to Apollodorus, the Cyclopes also provided Poseidon with his trident and Hades with his cap of invisibility, and the gods used these weapons to defeat the Titans.

Although the primordial Cyclopes of the &quot;Theogony&quot; were presumably immortal (as were their brothers the Titans), the sixth-century BC Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, has them being killed by Apollo. Later sources tell us why: Apollo&#x27;s son Asclepius had been killed by Zeus&#x27; thunderbolt, and Apollo killed the Cyclopes, the makers of the thunderbolt, in revenge. According to a scholiast on Euripides&#x27; &quot;Alcestis&quot;, the fifth-century BC mythographer Pherecydes supplied the same motive, but said that Apollo, rather than killing the Cyclopes, killed their &quot;sons&quot; (one of whom he named Aortes) instead. No other source mentions any offspring of the Cyclopes. A Pindar fragment suggests that Zeus himself killed the Cyclopes to prevent them from making thunderbolts for anyone else.

The Cyclopes&#x27; prowess as craftsmen is stressed by Hesiod who says &quot;strength and force and contrivances were in their works.&quot; Being such skilled craftsmen of great size and strength, later poets, beginning with the third-century BC poet Callimachus, imagine these Cyclopes, the primordial makers of Zeus&#x27; thunderbolt, becoming the assistants of the smith-god Hephaestus, at his forge in Sicily, underneath Mount Etna, or perhaps the nearby Aeolian Islands. In his &quot;Hymn to Artemis&quot;, Callimachus has the Cyclopes on the Aeolian island of Lipari, working &quot;at the anvils of Hephaestus&quot;, make the bows and arrows used by Apollo and Artemis. The first-century BC Latin poet Virgil, in his epic &quot;Aeneid&quot;, has the Cyclopes: &quot;Brontes and Steropes and bare-limbed Pyracmon&quot; toil under the direction of Vulcan (Hephaestus), in caves underneath Mount Etna and the Aeolian islands. Virgil describes the Cyclopes, in Vulcan&#x27;s smithy forging iron, making a thunderbolt, a chariot for Mars, and Pallas&#x27;s Aegis, with Vulcan interrupting their work to command the Cyclopes to fashion arms for Aeneas. The later Latin poet Ovid also has the Hesiodic Cyclopes, Brontes and Steropes (along with a third Cyclops named Acmonides), work at forges in Sicilian caves.

According to a Hellenistic astral myth, the Cyclopes were the builders of the first altar. The myth was a catasterism, which explained how the constellation the Altar (Ara) came to be in the heavens. According to the myth, the Cyclopes built an altar upon which Zeus and the other gods swore alliance before their war with the Titans. After their victory, &quot;the gods placed the altar in the sky in commemoration&quot;, and thus began the practice, according to the myth, of men swearing oaths upon altars &quot;as a guarantee of their good faith&quot;.

According to the second-century geographer Pausanias, there was a sanctuary called the &quot;altar of the Cyclopes&quot; on the Isthmus of Corinth at a place sacred to Poseidon, where sacrifices were offered to the Cyclopes. There is no evidence for any other cult associated with the Cyclopes. According to a version of the story in the &quot;Iliad&quot; scholia (found nowhere else), when Zeus swallowed Metis, she was pregnant with Athena by the Cyclops Brontes.

Although described by Hesiod as &quot;having very violent hearts&quot; (&quot;ὑπέρβιον ἦτορ ἔχοντας&quot;), and while their extraordinary size and strength would have made them capable of great violence, there is no indication of the Hesiodic Cyclopes having behaved in any other way than as dutiful servants of the gods.

Walter Burkert suggests that groups or societies of lesser gods, like the Hesiodic Cyclopes, &quot;mirror real cult associations (&quot;thiasoi&quot;) ... It may be surmised that smith guilds lie behind Cabeiri, Idaian Dactyloi, Telchines, and Cyclopes.&quot;

===Homeric Cyclopes===

In an episode of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (c. 700 BC), the hero Odysseus encounters the Cyclops Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon, a one-eyed man-eating giant who lives with his fellow Cyclopes in a distant land. The relationship between these Cyclopes and Hesiod&#x27;s Cyclopes is unclear. Homer described a very different group of Cyclopes, than the skilled and subservient craftsman of Hesiod. Homer&#x27;s Cyclopes live in the &quot;world of men&quot; rather than among the gods, as they presumably do in the &quot;Theogony&quot;. The Homeric Cyclopes are presented as uncivilized shepherds, who live in caves, savages with no regard for Zeus. They have no knowledge of agriculture, ships or craft. They live apart and lack any laws.

The fifth-century BC playwright Euripides also told the story of Odysseus&#x27; encounter with Polyphemus in his satyr play &quot;Cyclops&quot;. Euripides&#x27; Cyclopes, like Homer&#x27;s, are uncultured cave-dwelling shepherds. They have no agriculture, no wine, and live on milk, cheese and the meat of sheep. They live solitary lives, and have no government. They are inhospitable to strangers, slaughtering and eating all who come to their land. While Homer does not say if the other Cyclopes are like Polyphemus in their appearance and parentage, Euripides makes it explicit, calling the Cyclopes &quot;Poseidon&#x27;s one-eyed sons&quot;. And while Homer is vague as to their location, Euripides locates the land of the Cyclopes on the island of Sicily near Mount Etna.

Like Euripides, Virgil has the Cyclopes of Polyphemus live on Sicily near Etna. For Virgil apparently, these Homeric Cyclopes are members of the same race of Cyclopes as Hesiod&#x27;s Brontes and Steropes, who live nearby.

===Cyclopean wall-builders===

Cyclopes were also said to have been the builders of the so-called &#x27;Cyclopean&#x27; walls of Mycenae, Tiryns, and Argos. Although they can be seen as being distinct, the Cyclopean wall-builders share several features with the Hesiodic Cyclopes: both groups are craftsmen of supernatural skill, possessing enormous strength, who lived in primordial times. These builder Cyclopes were apparently used to explain the construction of the stupendous walls at Mycenae and Tiryns, composed of massive stones that seemed too large and heavy to have been moved by ordinary men.

These master builders were famous in antiquity from at least the fifth century BC onwards. The poet Pindar has Heracles driving the cattle of Geryon through the &quot;Cyclopean portal&quot; of the Tirynian king Eurystheus. The mythographer Pherecydes says that Perseus brought the Cyclopes with him from Seriphos to Argos, presumably to build the walls of Mycenae. Proetus, the mythical king of ancient Argos, was said to have brought a group of seven Cyclopes from Lycia to build the walls of Tiryns.

The late fifth and early fourth-century BC comic poet Nicophon wrote a play called either &quot;Cheirogastores&quot; or &quot;Encheirogastores&quot; (&quot;Hands-to-Mouth&quot;), which is thought to have been about these Cyclopean wall-builders. Ancient lexicographers explained the title as meaning &quot;those who feed themselves by manual labour&quot;, and, according to Eustathius of Thessalonica, the word was used to describe the Cyclopean wall-builders, while &quot;hands-to-mouth&quot; was one of the three kinds of Cyclopes distinguished by scholia to Aelius Aristides. Similarly, possibly deriving from Nicophon&#x27;s comedy, the first-century Greek geographer Strabo says these Cyclopes were called &quot;Bellyhands&quot; (&quot;gasterocheiras&quot;) because they earned their food by working with their hands.

The first-century natural philosopher Pliny the Elder, in his &quot;Natural History&quot;, reported a tradition, attributed to Aristotle, that the Cyclopes were the inventors of masonry towers. In the same work Pliny also mentions the Cyclopes, as being among those credited with being the first to work with iron, as well as bronze. In addition to walls, other monuments were attributed to the Cyclopes. For example, Pausanias says that at Argos there was &quot;a head of Medusa made of stone, which is said to be another of the works of the Cyclopes&quot;.

== Principal sources ==
===Hesiod===
According to the &quot;Theogony&quot; of Hesiod, Uranus (Sky) mated with Gaia (Earth) and produced eighteen children. First came the twelve Titans, next came the three one-eyed Cyclopes:

Following the Cyclopes, Gaia next gave birth to three more monstrous brothers, the Hecatoncheires, or Hundred-Handed Giants. Uranus hated his monstrous children, and as soon as each was born, he imprisoned them underground, somewhere deep inside Gaia. Eventually Uranus&#x27; son, the Titan Cronus, castrated Uranus, becoming the new ruler of the cosmos, but he did not release his brothers, the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires, from their imprisonment in Tartarus.

For this failing, Gaia foretold that Cronus would eventually be overthrown by one of his children, as he had overthrown his own father. To prevent this, as each of his children were born, Cronus swallowed them whole; as gods they were not killed, but imprisoned within his belly. His wife, Rhea, sought her mother&#x27;s advice to avoid losing all of her children in this way, and Gaia advised her to give Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. In this way, Zeus was spared the fate of his elder siblings, and was hidden away by his mother. When he was grown, Zeus forced his father to vomit up his siblings, who rebelled against the Titans. Zeus released the Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires, who became his allies. While the Hundred-Handed Giants fought alongside Zeus and his siblings, the Cyclopes gave Zeus his great weapon, the thunderbolt, with the aid of which he was eventually able to overthrow the Titans, establishing himself as the ruler of the cosmos.

===Homer===

In Book 9 of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus describes to his hosts the Phaeacians his encounter with the Cyclops Polyphemus. Having just left the land of the Lotus-eaters, Odysseus says &quot;Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we came to the land of the Cyclopes&quot;.
Homer had already (Book 6) described the Cyclopes as &quot;men overweening in pride who plundered [their neighbors the Phaeacians] continually&quot;, driving the Phaeacians from their home. In Book 9, Homer gives a more detailed description of the Cyclopes as:
According to Homer, the Cyclopes have no ships, nor ship-wrights, nor other craftsman, and know nothing of agriculture. They have no regard for Zeus or the other gods, for the Cyclopes hold themselves to be &quot;better far than they&quot;.

Homer says that &quot;godlike&quot; Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon and the nymph Thoosa, the daughter of Phorcys, is the &quot;greatest among all the Cyclopes&quot;. Homer describes Polyphemus as a shepherd who:
Although Homer does not say explicitly that Polyphemus is one-eyed, for the account of his blinding to make sense he must be. If Homer meant for the other Cyclopes to be assumed (as they usually are) to be like Polyphemus, then they too will be one-eyed sons of Poseidon; however Homer says nothing explicit about either the parentage or appearance of the other Cyclopes.

===Euripides===
The Hesiodic Cyclopes: makers of Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts, the Homeric Cyclopes: brothers of Polyphemus, and the Cyclopean wall-builders, all figure in the plays of the fifth-century BC playwright Euripides. In his play &quot;Alcestis&quot;, where we are told that the Cyclopes who forged Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts, were killed by Apollo. The prologue of that play has Apollo explain:

Euripides&#x27; satyr play &quot;Cyclops&quot; tells the story of Odysseus&#x27; encounter with the Cyclops Polyphemus, famously told in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. It takes place on the island of Sicily near the volcano Mount Etna where, according to the play, &quot;Poseidon’s one-eyed sons, the man-slaying Cyclopes, dwell in their remote caves.&quot; Euripides describes the land where Polyphemus&#x27; brothers live, as having no &quot;walls and city battlements&quot;, and a place where &quot;no men dwell&quot;. The Cyclopes have no rulers and no government, &quot;they are solitaries: no one is anyone’s subject.&quot; They grow no crops, living only &quot;on milk and cheese and the flesh of sheep.&quot; They have no wine, &quot;hence the land they dwell in knows no dancing&quot;. They show no respect for the important Greek value of Xenia (&quot;guest friendship). When Odysseus asks if they are pious and hospitable toward strangers (&quot;φιλόξενοι δὲ χὤσιοι περὶ ξένους&quot;), he is told: &quot;most delicious, they maintain, is the flesh of strangers ... everyone who has come here has been slaughtered.&quot;

Several of Euripides&#x27; plays also make reference to the Cyclopean wall-builders. Euripides calls their walls &quot;heaven-high&quot; (&quot;οὐράνια&quot;), describes &quot;the Cyclopean foundations&quot; of Mycenae as &quot;fitted snug with red plumbline and mason’s hammer&quot;, and calls Mycenae &quot;O hearth built by the Cyclopes&quot;. He calls Argos &quot;the city built by the Cyclopes&quot;, refers to &quot;the temples the Cyclopes built&quot; and describes the &quot;fortress of Perseus&quot; as &quot;the work of Cyclopean hands&quot;.

=== Callimachus ===
For the third-century BC poet Callimachus, the Hesiodic Cyclopes Brontes, Steropes and Arges, become assistants at the forge of the smith-god Hephaestus. Callimachus has the Cyclopes make Artemis&#x27; bow, arrows and quiver, just as they had (apparently) made those of Apollo. Callimachus locates the Cyclopes on the island of Lipari, the largest of the Aeolian Islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the northern coast of Sicily, where Artemis finds them &quot;at the anvils of Hephaestus&quot; making a horse-trough for Poseidon:

And Artemis asks:

The first-century BC Roman poet Virgil seems to combine the Cyclopes of Hesiod with those of Homer, having them live alongside each other in the same part of Sicily. In his Latin epic &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Virgil has the hero Aeneas follow in the footsteps of Odysseus, the hero of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Approaching Sicily and Mount Etna, in Book 3 of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Aeneas manages to survive the dangerous Charybdis, and at sundown comes to the land of the Cyclopes, while &quot;near at hand Aetna thunders&quot;. The Cyclopes are described as being &quot;in shape and size like Polyphemus ... a hundred other monstrous Cyclopes [who] dwell all along these curved shores and roam the high mountains.&quot; After narrowly escaping from Polyphemus, Aeneas tells how, responding to the Cyclops&#x27; &quot;mighty roar&quot;:
Later, in Book 8 of the same poem, Virgil has the Hesiodic Cyclopes Brontes and Steropes, along with a third Cyclopes which he names Pyracmon, work in an extensive network of caverns stretching from Mount Etna to the Aeolian Islands. As the assistants of the smith-god Vulcan, they forge various items for the gods: thunderbolts for Jupiter, a chariot for Mars, and armor for Minerva:
===Apollodorus===
The mythographer Apollodorus, gives an account of the Hesiodic Cyclopes similar to that of Hesiod&#x27;s, but with some differences, and additional details. According to Apollodorus, the Cyclopes were born after the Hundred-Handers, but before the Titans (unlike Hesiod who makes the Titans the eldest and the Hundred-Handers the youngest).

Uranus bound the Hundred-Handers and the Cyclopes, and cast them all into Tartarus, &quot;a gloomy place in Hades as far distant from earth as earth is distant from the sky.&quot; But the Titans are, apparently, allowed to remain free (unlike in Hesiod). When the Titans overthrew Uranus, they freed the Hundred-Handers and Cyclopes (unlike in Hesiod, where they apparently remained imprisoned), and made Cronus their sovereign. But Cronus once again bound the six brothers, and reimprisoned them in Tartarus.

As in Hesiod&#x27;s account, Rhea saved Zeus from being swallowed by Cronus, and Zeus was eventually able to free his siblings, and together they waged war against the Titans. According to Apollodorus, in the tenth year of that war, Zeus learned from Gaia, that he would be victorious if he had the Hundred-Handers and the Cyclopes as allies. So Zeus slew their warder Campe (a detail not found in Hesiod) and released them, and in addition to giving Zeus his thunderbolt (as in Hesiod), the Cyclopes also gave Poseidon his trident, and Hades a helmet (presumably the same cap of invisibility which Athena borrowed in the &quot;Iliad&quot;), and &quot;with these weapons the gods overcame the Titans&quot;.

Apollodorus also mentions a tomb of Geraestus, &quot;the Cyclops&quot; at Athens upon which, in the time of king Aegeus, the Athenians sacrificed the daughters of Hyacinth.

===Nonnus===
&quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, composed in the 4th or 5th century BC, is the longest surviving poem from antiquity – 20,426 lines. It is written by the poet Nonnus in the Homeric dialect, and its main subject is the life of Dionysus. It describes a war that occurred between Dionysus&#x27; troops and those of the Indian king Deriades. In book 28 of the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; the Cyclopes join with Dionysian troops, and they prove to be great warriors and crush most of the Indian king&#x27;s troops.

==Transformations of Polyphemus==
Depictions of the Cyclops Polyphemus have differed radically, depending on the literary genres in which he has appeared, and have given him an individual existence independent of the Homeric herdsman encountered by Odysseus. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, he was a man-eating monster dwelling in an unspecified land. Some centuries later, a dithyramb by Philoxenus of Cythera, followed by several episodes by the Greek pastoral poets, created of him a comedic and generally unsuccessful lover of the water nymph Galatea. In the course of these he woos his love to the accompaniment of either a cithara or the pan-pipes. Such episodes take place on the island of Sicily, and it was here that the Latin poet Ovid also set the tragic love story of Polyphemus and Galatea recounted in the Metamorphoses. Still later tradition made him the eventually successful husband of Galatea and the ancestor of the Celtic and Illyrian races.

==Location==
From at least the fifth-century BC onwards, Cyclopes have been associated with the island of Sicily, or the volcanic Aeolian islands just off Sicily&#x27;s north coast. The fifth-century BC historian Thucydides says that the &quot;earliest inhabitants&quot; of Sicily were reputed to be the Cyclopes and Laestrygones (another group of man-eating giants encountered by Odysseus in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;). Thucydides also reports the local belief that Hephaestus (along with his Cyclopean assistants?) had his forge on the Aeolian island of Vulcano.

Euripides locates Odysseus&#x27; Cyclopes on the island of Sicily, near the volcano Mount Etna, and in the same play addresses Hephaestus as &quot;lord of Aetna&quot;. The poet Callimachus locates the Cyclopes&#x27; forge on the island of Lipari, the largest of the Aeolians. Virgil associates both the Hesiodic and the Homeric Cyclopes with Sicily. He has the thunderbolt makers: &quot;Brontes and Steropes and bare-limbed Pyracmon&quot;, work in vast caverns extending underground from Mount Etna to the island of Vulcano, while the Cyclops brethren of Polyphemus live on Sicily where &quot;near at hand Aetna thunders&quot;.

As Thucydides notes, in the case of Hephaestus&#x27; forge on Vulcano, locating the Cyclopes&#x27; forge underneath active volcanoes provided an explanation for the fire and smoke often seen rising from them.

In 1587, Italian cartographer Urbano Monti depicted a &quot;ciclops&quot; on a portion of his world map identified as New Guinea.

==Etymology==
For the ancient Greeks, the name &quot;Cyclopes&quot; meant &quot;Circle-eyes&quot; or &quot;Round-eyes&quot;, derived from the Greek &quot;kúklos&quot; (&quot;circle&quot;) and &quot;ops&quot; (&quot;eye&quot;). This meaning can be seen as early as Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; (8th–7th century BC), which explains that the Cyclopes were called that &quot;since a single circle-shaped eye was set in their foreheads&quot;. Adalbert Kuhn, expanding on Hesiod&#x27;s etymology, proposed a connection between the first element &quot;kúklos&quot; (which can also mean &quot;wheel&quot;) and the &quot;wheel of the sun&quot;, producing the meaning &quot;wheel (of the sun)-eyes&quot;. Other etymologies have been proposed which derive the second element of the name from the Greek &quot;klops&quot; (&quot;thief&quot;) producing the meanings &quot;wheel-thief&quot; or, deriving the first element from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;, &quot;cattle-thief&quot;. Although Walter Burkert has described Hesiod&#x27;s etymology as &quot;not too attractive&quot;, Hesiod&#x27;s explanation still finds acceptance by modern scholars.

== Possible origins ==
Various origin hypotheses for the Cyclopes, including its distinctive one-eyed appearance, have been offered.

A possible origin for one-eyed Cyclopes was advanced by the palaeontologist Othenio Abel in 1914. Abel proposed that fossil skulls of Pleistocene dwarf elephants, commonly found in coastal caves of Italy and Greece, may have given rise to the Polyphemus story. Abel suggested that the large, central nasal cavity (for the trunk) in the skull might have been interpreted as a large single eye-socket. However, this claim has been criticised by Greek mythology scholars Mercedes Aguirre and Richard Buxton as lacking evidence and being unfalsifiable. Other similarly unverifiable and unfalsifiable explanations include that the eye originated from the appearance of volcanism related features, such as craters, or bubbles in volcanic water and mud.

Cyclopia, a rare birth defect, can result in foetuses which have a single eye. Although the possibility has been raised of a link between this deformity and the myth of the one-eyed Cyclopes, in such cases, the eye is below the nose—rather than above as in ancient Greek depictions.

As noted above, Walter Burkert sees the possibility of the Hesiodic Cyclopes having ancient smith guilds as their basis.

<doc id="55872" wikidata="Q664248" url="?curid=55872" title="Love (band)">
<text>Love is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965. Led by Arthur Lee, the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, they were one of the first racially diverse American rock bands. Their sound incorporated an eclectic range of styles including garage, folk rock, and psychedelia. While finding only modest success on the music charts, peaking in 1966 with their US No. 33 hit &quot;7 and 7 Is,&quot; Love would come to be praised by critics as their third album, &quot;Forever Changes&quot; (1967), became generally regarded as one of the best albums of the 1960s.

The band&#x27;s classic lineup is considered to consist of Lee, the guitarist and singer Bryan MacLean, the bassist Ken Forssi, the guitarist Johnny Echols and the drummer Donnie Conca, who was replaced by Alban &quot;Snoopy&quot; Pfisterer. By 1968, only Lee remained and he continued recording as Love with varied members through the 1970s. MacLean and Forssi died in 1998. Lee died in 2006. &quot;Forever Changes&quot; was added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry in 2011. In recent years, original member Johnny Echols has toured under the title of the Love Band or Love Revisited.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years ===
Singer/multi-instrumentalist Arthur Lee, who was originally from Memphis, Tennessee but had lived in Los Angeles since the age of five, had been recording since 1963 with his bands the LAG&#x27;s and Lee&#x27;s American Four. He wrote and produced the single &quot;My Diary&quot; for Rosa Lee Brooks in 1964, which featured Jimi Hendrix on guitar. The Sons Of Adam, which included future Love drummer Michael Stuart, recorded the Lee composition &quot;Feathered Fish&quot;. After attending a performance by the Byrds, Lee decided to form a band that joined the newly minted folk-rock sound of the Byrds to his primarily rhythm and blues style.

Singer/guitarist Bryan MacLean, who had met Lee when he was working as a roadie for The Byrds, joined Lee&#x27;s new band, which was first called the Grass Roots. MacLean had also been playing in bands around Los Angeles since about 1963. Also joining the band was another Memphis native, lead guitarist Johnny Echols, and drummer Don Conka. A short time later, Conka was replaced by Alban &quot;Snoopy&quot; Pfisterer. Love&#x27;s first bassist, Johnny Fleckenstein, went on to join the Standells in 1967. Fleckenstein was replaced by Ken Forssi (formerly of a post-&quot;Wipe Out&quot; lineup of The Surfaris). Upon the appearance of another group called The Grass Roots, Lee changed the name of the new band to Love.

Love started playing the Los Angeles clubs in April 1965 and became a popular local attraction, while gaining the attention of the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. The band lived communally in a house called &quot;the Castle&quot;, a large but run-down residence sourced by Ronnie Haran. It was a dilapidated mansion that the band was allowed to live in if they did the maintenance and paid the taxes. According to John Einarson in the book &quot;Forever Changes&quot;, the cover photo of their first two albums was of the band taken in Laurel Canyon at a burned down house that only had the remains of a fireplace left standing.

Signed to Elektra Records as the label&#x27;s first rock act, the band scored a minor hit single in 1966 with their version of Burt Bacharach and Hal David&#x27;s &quot;My Little Red Book&quot;. Their first album, &quot;Love&quot;, was released in March 1966. The album sold moderately well and reached No. 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The single &quot;7 and 7 Is&quot;, released in July 1966, gained notice for the exceptional guitar work of Johnny Echols and proto-punk style drumming of Pfisterer. The single became Love&#x27;s highest-charting single at No. 33 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Two more members were added around this time, Tjay Cantrelli (real name John Barbieri) on woodwinds and Michael Stuart on drums. Pfisterer, never a confident drummer, switched to harpsichord. Elektra&#x27;s art director, William S. Harvey, designed a distinctive logo for the band, &quot;four cartoonish letters with exaggerated, curvaceous serifs&quot;, incorporating male and female symbols.

Arthur Lee had an exclusive contract with Herb Cohen for a short time after signing with Elektra Records. After Lee met Ronnie Haran, booking manager for the Whisky a Go Go, Cohen was fired by Arthur in favor of Haran. Haran continued to manage Love, despite not having an official contract, for a couple years. Mike Gruber took over after Haran departed as manager, though Haran remained somewhat involved with the group.

=== &quot;Forever Changes&quot; era ===

Love&#x27;s second album, &quot;Da Capo&quot;, was released in November 1966 and included &quot;7 and 7 Is&quot; as well as the subsequent singles &quot;She Comes in Colors&quot; and &quot;&quot;. It marked the experimental direction Arthur wanted to take. With the seven member lineup for DaCapo, shortly after this album, Cantrelli and Pfisterer left the band, leaving it as a five-piece once again. Their third album &quot;Forever Changes&quot; was released in November 1967 and was co-produced by Bruce Botnick. The album displayed a softer and more avant-garde approach for the band. By this time, tension arose between Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean, who wanted more of his songs on the album. The band recorded the album in only 64 hours, though many professional session players were used, including some who replaced actual band members in one or two songs. Writer Richard Meltzer, in his book &quot;The Aesthetics of Rock&quot;, commented on Love&#x27;s &quot;orchestral moves&quot;, &quot;post-doper word contraction cuteness&quot;, and Lee&#x27;s vocal style that serves as a &quot;reaffirmation of Johnny Mathis&quot;. &quot;Forever Changes&quot; had one single, MacLean&#x27;s &quot;Alone Again Or&quot;, which reached number 123 on the pop charts. By this stage, Love were far more popular in the UK, where the album reached No. 24, than in their home country, where it could only reach No. 154. &quot;Forever Changes&quot; has since received recognition as one of the greatest rock albums of all time, appearing on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry in 2011.

=== Later years ===
For unclear reasons, Bryan MacLean left the band after &quot;Forever Changes&quot; (though one possible issue was a solo deal that he had signed with Elektra), while Lee dismissed all the other members. MacLean later reemerged as a Contemporary Christian artist. Johnny Echols and Ken Forssi succumbed to drug addiction and crime, and disappeared from the music scene; and drummer Michael Stuart also retired from music. Echols eventually moved to New York and became an in-demand studio musician.

Arthur Lee, as the only remaining member, convened a new lineup of Love with Jay Donnellan (soon replaced by Gary Rowles) on guitar, Frank Fayad on bass, and George Suranovich on drums. This lineup played in a blues rock style, as opposed to the folk-rock and psychedelic styles of the band&#x27;s previous incarnation. The new lineup never garnered the widespread acceptance or acclaim of the original group. Three albums were released by various permutations of this lineup: &quot;Four Sail&quot; (1969), &quot;Out Here&quot; (1969), and &quot;False Start&quot; (1970). The last featured a guest appearance by Jimi Hendrix. Another album by this incarnation of the band was recorded in 1971, but the material was not released until 2009 on the compilation album &quot;Love Lost&quot;. Arthur Lee released the solo album &quot;Vindicator&quot; in 1972. Another lost Love album titled &quot;Black Beauty&quot; was recorded in 1973 by a new lineup featuring guitarist Melvan Whittington, bassist Robert Rozelle, and drummer Joe Blocker, but Arthur Lee&#x27;s record label went out of business before it was released. The album was finally released by High Moon Records in 2012. The final official Love album, &quot;Reel to Real&quot; (1974), was recorded by Lee and session musicians. It features the track &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Gotta Live&quot;, which was previously recorded by Lee for &quot;Vindicator&quot;.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, there were various attempts to reunite the original Love lineup. At the suggestion of late-period guitarist John Sterling, Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean reunited for one show in 1978, which was recorded and released as &quot;Love Live&quot; in 1980. Material from &quot;Out Here&quot; plus four previously unreleased live tracks was released as &quot;Studio/Live&quot; in 1982. Arthur Lee was largely inactive in the 1980s and only made sporadic onstage appearances with pickup bands.

Lee reemerged in 1992 with a new album titled &quot;Five String Serenade&quot;, released under the name Arthur Lee &amp; Love. The album&#x27;s title track was later covered by Mazzy Star. Lee then returned to semi-regular performing, often backed by the band Baby Lemonade. In 1995, Rhino Records released the compilation &quot;Love Story&quot;, a two-disc set with extensive liner notes which chronicled the band&#x27;s 1966–1972 period.

Ken Forssi, bassist for the classic Love lineup, died of a suspected brain tumor at age 54 on January 5, 1998. Bryan MacLean died of a heart attack at age 52 on December 25, 1998, while having dinner with a young fan who was researching a book about Love. Arthur Lee was in prison when both of these former bandmates died.

=== Reformation and reunions ===
After spending six years in prison from 1995 to 2001 for firearms offenses, Lee began touring under the name Love with Arthur Lee, with the members of Baby Lemonade rounding out the lineup. In 2002 Michael Stuart (now known as Michael Stuart-Ware), the drummer on the Love albums &quot;Da Capo&quot; and &quot;Forever Changes&quot;, wrote the acclaimed book &quot;Behind the Scenes on the Pegasus Carousel with the Legendary Rock Group Love&quot;.
Johnny Echols joined Lee&#x27;s latest group for a special &quot;Forever Changes&quot; 35th Anniversary performance in the spring of 2003 and again for tours in 2004 and 2005. Due to Arthur Lee&#x27;s battle with acute myeloid leukemia, the details of which were not known by the band at the time, he could not participate in the final tour in 2005. Since no one knew of his illness, Lee&#x27;s decision to forgo the final tour was met with confused reactions. The remaining members of the band, led by Echols, continued to perform without Lee, under the name The Love Band.

Michael Stuart-Ware and Johnny Echols performed with Baby Lemonade at Hollywood&#x27;s Whisky A Go-Go on June 28, 2006, in a benefit concert for Arthur Lee. The show included guest appearances by Robert Plant and Nils Lofgren. Lee died of acute myeloid leukemia on August 3, 2006, at age 61.

In 2009, a reformed version of Love, featuring Johnny Echols, members of Baby Lemonade, and Probyn Gregory of the Wondermints, toured the United States and Canada. Michael Stuart-Ware was listed as a member of this act for a time in 2009. The group continued to tour sporadically in the following years under the name the Love Band featuring Johnny Echols. This group completed a &#x27;farewell tour&#x27; of the UK in 2019, but continues to perform in the U.S. as LOVE-Revisited. In November 2021, they announced that they would again tour in the UK in 2022, and at some shows would play the whole of their first two albums, &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Da Capo&quot;, in their entirety, as well as &quot;Forever Changes&quot;.

In August 2024, a new album of unreleased music written by Lee was announced. Titled &quot;Just to Remind You&quot;, the release comprises material recorded between 1990 and 2005 &quot;curated and polished by trusted collaborators&quot;. &quot;Just to Remind You&quot; is scheduled for release in 2025.

== Influence ==

Today, Love&#x27;s critical reputation exceeds the limited success they experienced during their time; their 1967 album &quot;Forever Changes&quot; is held in particularly high regard and often appears on lists of the best rock albums of all time. During their late-1960s heyday, the Rolling Stones and the Doors were known to be Love fans. Many bands of the 1990s that were influenced by psychedelic rock list Love as a major inspiration, such as Primal Scream, The Stone Roses, and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Robert Plant cites &quot;Forever Changes&quot; as one of his favorite albums.

<text>A Masonic lodge, also called &quot;a private lodge&quot; or &quot;constituent lodge&quot;, is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry. 

It is also a commonly used term for a building where Freemasons meet and hold their meetings. Every new lodge must be warranted or chartered by a Grand Lodge, but is subject to its direction only by enforcing the published constitution of the jurisdiction. By exception, the three surviving lodges that formed the world&#x27;s first known grand lodge in London (now merged into the United Grand Lodge of England) have the unique privilege to operate as &quot;time immemorial&quot;, i.e., without such warrant; only one other lodge operates without a warrant – the Grand Stewards&#x27; Lodge in London, although it is not entitled to the &quot;time immemorial&quot; status. 

A Freemason is generally entitled to visit any lodge in any jurisdiction (&quot;i.e.&quot;, under any Grand Lodge) in amity (recognition of mutual status) with his own Grand Lodge. In some jurisdictions this privilege is restricted to Master Masons (that is, Freemasons who have attained the Order&#x27;s third degree). He is first usually required to check, and certify, the regularity of the relationship of the Lodge – and be able to satisfy that Lodge of his legality of membership. Freemasons gather together as a Lodge to confer (also known by the term &quot;work&quot;) the three basic Degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason.

==Masonic premises==

Freemasons meet &quot;as&quot; a lodge, not &quot;in&quot; a lodge. In this context, the word &quot;lodge&quot; refers to a local chapter of Freemasons, meeting as a body. However, the term is often misused to refer to the buildings or rooms that Masons meet in. Masonic premises are also sometimes referred to as &quot;Temples&quot; (&quot;of Philosophy and the Arts&quot;). In many countries &quot;Masonic centre&quot; or &quot;Masonic hall&quot; has now replaced these terms to avoid arousing prejudice and suspicion, or confusion with a religious building. Several different lodges, or other Masonic organizations, often use the same premises at different times.

==Types==
===Blue lodge===
&quot;s&quot;, &quot;craft lodges&quot; or &quot;ancient craft lodges&quot; refer to the lodges that work the first three Masonic degrees: Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason, rather than the appendant Masonic orders such as York Rite and Scottish Rite. The term &quot;craft lodge&quot; is used in Great Britain. The &quot;blue lodge&quot; is said to refer to the traditional colour of regalia in lodges derived from English or Irish Freemasonry. Although the term was originally frowned upon, it has gained widespread and mainstream usage in America in recent times.

=== Light Blue Lodge ===
In the UK, the term &quot;Light Blue Lodge&quot; typically refers to a Craft Lodge which focuses on new and young masons or any Freemasons begin their journey. The name &quot;Light Blue&quot; comes from the color of the aprons worn by new members and young Masons, which are light blue, symbolizing the early stages of their Masonic journey.

For new and young Masons, the Light Blue Lodge plays a crucial role because:

# Entry Point: It’s where they are initiated into Freemasonry and learn the basic principles and rituals of the fraternity.
# Mentorship and Growth: In these lodges, new members are often paired with more experienced Masons who mentor them, guiding them in their early Masonic development.
# Community and Fellowship: Young and new Masons find camaraderie and brotherhood in the Light Blue Lodge, building lasting friendships with other members.
# Pathway to Further Degrees: Once they complete the first three degrees in a Light Blue Lodge, members may choose to advance into other bodies or degrees within Freemasonry, such as York Rite or Scottish Rite, which build on the knowledge from the Craft Lodge.

In short, Light Blue Lodges are essential for the growth and development of new and young Masons as they embark on their Masonic journey.

Examples of light blue club

* Connaught Club (Metropolitan Grand Lodge)
* Kent Club (Metropolitan Grand Lodge)
* Manchester Level Club (East Lancashire in UK)
* Lodge Sine Nomine No. 10000
* 1 Kennedy Club (District of Hong Kong and Far East)

===Research lodge===
&quot;Research lodges&quot; have the purpose of furthering Masonic scholarship. Quatuor Coronati Lodge, in London, is an example of a research lodge; it has a strictly limited membership and receives visitors and papers from all over the world. Many jurisdictions have well-established research lodges, which usually meet less frequently than blue lodges and do not confer degrees.

===Lodge of Instruction===
In Great Britain, a lodge of instruction (LOI) may be associated with a Lodge, but is not constituted separately. The lodge of instruction provides the officers and those who wish to become officers an opportunity to rehearse ritual under the guidance of an experienced brother; there may also be lectures around the ritual and the symbolism in the lodge within a Lodge of Instruction, in order to develop the knowledge and understanding of the membership.

In some jurisdictions in the United States, the lodge of instruction serves as a warranted lodge for candidate instruction in other aspects of Freemasonry besides ritual rehearsal, as well as hosting a speaker on topics both Masonic and non-Masonic.

===Mother lodge===
In Great Britain, the term mother lodge is used to identify the particular Lodge where the individual was first &quot;made a Mason&quot; (i.e. received his Entered Apprentice degree). &#x27;Mother lodge&#x27; may also refer to a lodge that sponsors the creation of a new lodge, the &quot; daughter lodge&quot;, to be warranted under the jurisdiction of the same grand lodge; specific procedures pertaining to this vary throughout history and in different jurisdictions. Lodge Mother Kilwinning No 0 in the Grand Lodge of Scotland is known as the Mother Lodge of Scotland, having been referred to in the Schaw Statutes of 1598 and 1599, and having itself warranted other lodges at a time when it did not subscribe to a grand lodge.

===Virtual lodge===
The 21st century has seen the rise of internet virtual lodges that meet online rather than in person. Examples are the Internet Lodge No. 9659, Lodge Ireland, and Castle Island Virtual Lodge No. 190. The ability to hold remote lodge meetings allows those who are distant to continue to attend, whether they are military servicemen serving overseas or they inhabit a sparsely populated region. Virtual lodges were held often during the COVID-19 pandemic, though most lodges have resumed regular in-person meetings as of 2024.

==Organization==

Lodges are governed by national, state or provincial authorities, usually called Grand Lodges or Grand Orients, whose published constitutions define the structure of freemasonry under their authority, and which appoint Grand Officers from their senior masons. Provincial Grand Lodges (which in England generally correspond to historic counties) exercise an intermediate authority, and also appoint Provincial Grand Officers.

Different grand lodges and their regions show subtleties of tradition and variation in the degrees and practice; for example under the Grand Lodge of Scotland, the Mark Degree (which is unrecognised by the United Grand Lodge of England, but has a separate Mark Grand Lodge) is integrated into &quot;The Craft&quot; as a completion of the second degree. In any case, Grand Lodges have limited jurisdiction over their member Lodges, and where there is no prescribed ritual Lodges may thus have considerable freedom of practice. Despite these minor differences, fraternal relations exist between Lodges of corresponding degrees under different Grand Lodges.

==Membership==
Membership requirements in Freemasonry have evolved over time and vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific Masonic style or branch. However, there are certain common requirements that have remained relatively consistent throughout the history of the fraternity.
===&quot;Regular&quot; Freemasonry===
In &quot;Regular&quot; Freemasonry, which follows the Anglo-American style, a candidate for initiation must generally meet the following criteria:

*Be a man
*Come of his own free will, either by his own initiative or by invitation in some jurisdictions
*Believe in a Supreme Being, although any specific religion is not specified and not required
*Be of good morals, reputation, and financially capable of supporting himself and his family
*Be at least 21 years old (with some jurisdictions allowing candidates as young as 18 or as old as 25)
*Live within the jurisdiction of the lodge (a requirement in some U.S. Grand Lodges and United Grand Lodge of England)
*Before petitioning, pass an initial qualification interview. Most of the time, this is done with the Master of the Lodge or another elected officer. In some areas of the world, this may also include a legal background check
*After petitioning, pass a number of separate interviews and inquiries conducted by the lodge&#x27;s Investigation Committee, which may take up to two years
*Be of &quot;sound mind and body&quot; (not a universal requirement)
*Be a &quot;Free Man,&quot; meaning not bound by servitude or slavery
*Receive a favorable vote from the lodge members

===Continental Freemasonry===
In Continental Freemasonry, which is prevalent in Europe and Latin America, the requirements may differ slightly and can take from one to three years:

*Minimum age of 18 in most cases
*Good moral character
*Free man, not bound by obligations that would conflict with Masonic duties
*Recommendation or background check
*Pass initial interview with the Master of the Lodge.
*Being invited by a member (sometimes called a &quot;godfather&quot;). 

===Prince Hall Freemasonry===
Prince Hall Freemasonry, which predominantly serves African American communities, generally follows similar requirements to Regular Freemasonry, with a few additional criteria:

*Be a man 18 years of age or older
*Believe in a Supreme Being regardless of religion
*Believe in the immortality of the soul
*Possess a desire to help others through community service and universal benevolence
*African descent (in somecases)
*Recommended by existing members
*Pass a background check

===Co-Masonry and Women&#x27;s Freemasonry===
Co-Masonry and Women&#x27;s Freemasonry admit both men and women, or women only, respectively. Their requirements are similar to Regular and Continental Freemasonry, with some variations:

*Be at least 18 years old.
*Be “Free” (free from dogmatic principles; open to growing and learning; have time to participate regularly; have the ability to pay annual dues).
*Be “of Good Report” (law abiding; striving toward self-improvement and service to humanity; accepting and tolerant). 
*Belief in a Supreme Being or higher power (in some cases)
*Recommendation from existing members may be required (Women&#x27;s Freemasonry)

===History and Evolution of Requirements===
The membership requirements in Freemasonry have evolved over time, reflecting changes in societal norms and the fraternity&#x27;s internal guidelines. Some notable developments include:

In the early days of speculative Freemasonry (18th century), the requirement of being a &quot;Free Man&quot; may have stemmed from the refusal of operative masons to share their secrets with slaves, who could be ordered to divulge them.
The &quot;Free Man&quot; requirement may have also been related to the necessity of having a license to trade and employ others, making the candidate a free man of the city or borough where the lodge was located.
The minimum age requirement has varied over time and across jurisdictions, with some allowing candidates as young as 18 and others setting the limit at 25. The belief in a Supreme Being has been a consistent requirement, although the specific religious affiliation has not been prescribed, reflecting Freemasonry&#x27;s openness to men of various faiths.

===Landmarks and Reasons behind Requirements===
The membership requirements in Freemasonry are guided by the fraternity&#x27;s Landmarks, which are the fundamental principles that define the essence of the Craft. Some of the Landmarks related to membership include:

*The belief in a Supreme Being
*The necessity of being a free man and of mature age
*The prohibition of women as members (in Regular Freemasonry)

These Landmarks and requirements serve several purposes:

Ensuring that candidates share common values and are committed to personal growth and moral character
Maintaining the integrity and harmony of the lodge by admitting members who are compatible with Masonic principles
Preserving the traditions and symbolic teachings of the fraternity
Fostering a sense of brotherhood and trust among members

===Progression through Degrees===
Once a candidate is elected and initiated into a lodge, he progresses through the three degrees of Freemasonry: Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason. The Lodge decides whether to confer each degree based on the candidate&#x27;s proficiency and readiness.
In Regular Freemasonry under the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), a Master Mason receives a Grand Lodge certificate, which may be required for visiting other lodges. A Master Mason is considered a full, lifetime member of the lodge where he received his degrees, with the right to demit (resign) if he is in good standing and has paid his dues.
After demitting, a Mason is still regarded as a member in absentia and may rejoin through a new application. However, he and his family have no rights, privileges, or claims on Freemasonry during his absence. Some Masonic scholars, such as Albert Mackey, argue that leaving the lodge does not exempt a Mason from his obligations or the moral conduct expected by the fraternity.
A Master Mason may be expelled from his lodge and Freemasonry if convicted of serious violations of civil or Masonic law. Expulsion from all of Freemasonry can only be implemented by a Grand Lodge, while individual lodges may expel members from their specific lodges.
===Affiliation and Plural Membership===
A Master Mason in good standing may join another regular lodge without taking the degrees again, although he may be expected to serve in office. If a Master Mason is dropped from the rolls for non-payment of dues, he may be reinstated in good standing by paying his current and back dues, with some jurisdictions requiring a ballot for re-admission.
Many Grand Lodges allow Master Masons to be &quot;plural affiliates,&quot; or members of more than one lodge simultaneously. However, some jurisdictions prohibit plural affiliates from serving as elected officers in multiple lodges at the same time.
The rules for affiliation and plural membership differ for Freemasons of the Entered Apprentice and Fellowcraft degrees. Some Grand Lodges do not allow Entered Apprentices or Fellowcrafts to demit but may permit them to join another lodge to earn the Master Mason degree with the consent of their original lodge.
The membership requirements, progression through degrees, and affiliation rules in Freemasonry are designed to ensure the integrity, harmony, and continuity of the fraternity while allowing for personal growth and brotherhood among its members. These guidelines have evolved over time, reflecting the changing needs and values of the Craft and society at large.

==Officers==
The names, roles and numbers of Lodge officers vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In most cases, there is an equivalent office in the Grand Lodge of the given jurisdiction, with the addition of the prefix &#x27;Grand&#x27; to the title in question.

There are certain &#x27;progressive&#x27; offices through which members move by a process of effective promotion, but also other more permanent offices, usually held by experienced members.

<text>A tabard is a type of short coat that was commonly worn by men during the late Middle Ages and early modern period in Europe. Generally worn outdoors, the coat was either sleeveless or had short sleeves or shoulder pieces. In its more developed form it was open at the sides, and it could be worn with or without a belt. Though most were ordinary garments, often work clothes, tabards might be emblazoned on the front and back with a coat of arms (livery), and in this form they survive as the distinctive garment of officers of arms.

In modern British usage, the term has been revived for what is known in American English as a cobbler apron: a lightweight open-sided upper overgarment, of similar design to its medieval and heraldic counterpart, worn in particular by workers in the catering, cleaning and healthcare industries as protective clothing, or outdoors by those requiring high-visibility clothing. Tabards may also be worn by percussionists in marching bands in order to protect their uniforms from the straps and rigging used to support the instruments.

==Middle Ages==

A tabard (from the French &quot;tabarde&quot;) was originally a humble outer garment of tunic form, generally without sleeves, worn by peasants, monks and foot-soldiers. In this sense, the earliest citation recorded in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates from .

By the second half of the 15th century, tabards, now open at the sides and so usually belted, were also being worn by knights in military contexts over their armour, and were usually emblazoned with their arms (though sometimes worn plain). The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; first records this use of the word in English in 1450. Tabards were apparently distinguished from surcoats by being open-sided, and by being shorter. In its later form, a tabard normally comprised four textile panels – two large panels hanging down the wearer&#x27;s front and back, and two smaller panels hanging over his arms as shoulder-pieces or open &quot;sleeves&quot; – each emblazoned with the same coat of arms. Tabards became an important means of battlefield identification with the development of plate armour as the use of shields declined. They are frequently represented on tomb effigies and monumental brasses of the late 15th and early 16th centuries.

A very expensive, but plain, garment described as a tabard is worn by Giovanni Arnolfini in the Arnolfini Portrait of 1434 (National Gallery, London). This may be made of silk and/or velvet, and is trimmed and fully lined with fur, possibly sable.

At The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, the scholars on the foundation were called tabarders, from the tabard (not in this case an emblazoned garment) which they wore.

A surviving garment similar to the medieval tabard is the monastic scapular. This is a wide strip of fabric worn front back of the body, with an opening for the head and no sleeves. It may have a hood, and may be worn under or over a belt.

==British heraldry==

By the end of the 16th century, the tabard was particularly associated with officers of arms. The shift in emphasis was reported by John Stow in 1598, when he described a tabard as:

In the case of Royal officers of arms, the tabard is emblazoned with the coat of arms of the sovereign. Private officers of arms, such as still exist in Scotland, make use of tabards emblazoned with the coat of arms of the person who employs them. In the United Kingdom the different ranks of officers of arms can be distinguished by the fabric from which their tabards are made. The tabard of a king of arms is made of velvet, the tabard of a herald of arms of satin, and that of a pursuivant of arms of damask silk. The oldest surviving English herald&#x27;s tabard is that of Sir William Dugdale as Garter King of Arms (1677–1686).

It was at one time the custom for English pursuivants to wear their tabards &quot;athwart&quot;, that is to say with the smaller (&quot;shoulder&quot;) panels at the front and back, and the larger panels over the arms; but this practice was ended during the reign of James II and VII.

The derisive Scots nickname of &quot;&quot; for John Balliol ( – 1314) may originate from either an alleged incident where his arms were stripped from his tabard in public, or a reference to the Balliol arms which are a plain shield with an orle, also known as an &quot;inescutcheon voided&quot;.

==Canadian heraldry==
A tabard for the Chief Herald of Canada to wear on special occasions was unveiled in May 2012 by David Johnston, the Governor General of Canada. The tabard weighs and is coloured in royal blue, a colour emblematic of the governor general. The tabard is made up of four sections that include several symbols. Its body is embroidered with stripes of alternating maple leaves with raven-bears at the body&#x27;s centre. The raven-bears are derived from the supporters of the arms of the CHA, and were designed in the emblematic tradition of Coast Salish and Kwakwakaʼwakw nation. Unlike traditional tabards, the coat of arms of Canada is embroidered on the tabard&#x27;s sleeves.

==Gallery==
==Cultural allusions==
A tabard was the inn sign of the Tabard Inn in Southwark, London, established in 1307 and remembered as the starting point for Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s pilgrims on their journey to Canterbury in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, dating from about the 1380s.

In E. C. Bentley&#x27;s short story &quot;The Genuine Tabard&quot;, published in his collection &quot;Trent Intervenes&quot; in 1938, a wealthy American couple purchase an antique heraldic tabard, having been told that it was worn in 1783 by Sir Rowland Verey, Garter King of Arms, when proclaiming the Peace of Versailles from the steps of St James&#x27;s Palace. The amateur detective Philip Trent is able to point out that it in fact bears the post-1837 royal arms.

<doc id="55876" wikidata="Q5278436" url="?curid=55876" title="Dinnerladies (TV series)">
<text>Dinnerladies (stylised as dinnerladies) is a British television sitcom created, written and co-produced by Victoria Wood. Two series were broadcast on BBC One from 1998 to 2000, with sixteen episodes in total. The programme is repeated on Gold, and Drama. The complete series was released on DVD in November 2004.

The series is set almost entirely in the canteen of HWD Components, a fictional factory in Manchester, featuring the caterers and regular customers as the main characters. It depicts the lives and social and romantic interactions of the staff, and is centred around the main character of Brenda Furlong, played by Wood.

==Plot==
The beginning of the first series introduces the characters, a group of mostly female and middle-aged canteen workers at a factory in Manchester. The main character is the kind and dependable Brenda &quot;Bren&quot; Furlong, whose relationship with sarcastic and exhausted canteen manager Tony Martin (Andrew Dunn) develops through the show.

The characters feature the prim and prudish Dolly Bellfield (Thelma Barlow) and her waspish friend Jean (Anne Reid), and the younger and snarky Twinkle (Maxine Peake), who is always late, and the scatter-brained but mild-mannered Anita (Shobna Gulati).

Stan Meadowcroft (Duncan Preston) is an opinionated and easily provoked, but well-meaning, maintenance man who is responsible for cleaning the factory and fixing equipment. The new cheery but disorganised human resources manager Philippa Moorcroft (Celia Imrie) is from the South and does not initially fit in well with the rest of the staff; she moved to Manchester because of her relationship with senior staff member Mr Michael (Christopher Greet).

Actress Julie Walters also appears in nine episodes as Bren&#x27;s down-and-out, delusional and manipulative mother, who lives in a caravan behind a petrol station. She abandoned Bren at an orphanage, and often turns up to ask for favours.

In the first series, Bren and Tony&#x27;s relationship begins to develop, and she supports him as he undergoes chemotherapy. Philippa tries to organise team-building activities, the factory receives a royal visit, Bren&#x27;s mother causes a scandal in the factory, the team bring their mothers to work, HWD Components merges with a Japanese company and Tony is temporarily replaced by Nicola Bodeux due to his treatment. Bodeux resigns after causing the canteen staff to strike, leading Bren to take charge on an interim basis amidst a crisis for the company.

Throughout the second series, Bren and Tony&#x27;s relationship develops further; the canteen takes on a work experience girl named Sigourney (Joanne Froggatt), Jean goes to stay with her sister after she is put in a foul mood by her unfaithful husband, a prisoner escapes from a local prison and Bren&#x27;s fear of needles is mistaken for pregnancy. Jane (Sue Devaney) organises a holiday to Marbella, on which Bren and Tony want to go together. After a mix-up, Bren manages to get a place, but she ends up giving the money to her mother instead. Their colleagues bet on when Bren and Tony will &quot;get it on&quot;, and they finally get together after Tony puts on a surprise birthday party for Bren, who was born on Christmas Eve.

Later in the series, Philippa cannot attend the Millennium meal she organises, and Anita has a baby; after leaving it anonymously for Bren to care for, she takes it back and goes on parental leave; she is replaced temporarily by Christine (Kay Adshead), who is disliked by the rest of the dinner ladies.

As the closure of the canteen looms, the staff plan to move on with their lives. Bren goes on a game show, but loses her chance to win after she cannot attend due to her mother&#x27;s death. It is revealed that her mother left her a large amount of money, which Bren and Tony use to move to Scotland.

==Series==

==Characters==
===Main===
*Victoria Wood as Brenda &quot;Bren&quot; Furlong
:Bren is the deputy manager of the canteen, and arguably the most reasonable of the characters. She had an unhappy childhood as her mother had her taken into foster care, and she later married an alcoholic named Martin of whom she was afraid. She is very good at solving her colleagues&#x27; problems but often doubts her ability to overcome her own hardships and has low self-esteem. She has a very quick mind, often scrambling for adjectives and making unintentional malapropisms. She has a near-encyclopaedic knowledge of film, which she makes many metaphorical references to, and gets as her subject on the quiz show &quot;Totally Trivial&quot;. Several times in the first series it is hinted that she has feelings for Tony, though nothing comes of this until halfway through the second series. At the end of the final episode, she and Tony make plans to move to Scotland.

*Andrew Dunn as Tony Martin
:The divorced canteen manager, whose battle against cancer is a running storyline in the first series, prompting him to want to do more with his life than running a canteen in the second. He is mildly frustrated when the staff are not working, and tends to come out with sarcastic remarks. Though he talks and thinks about women a lot, he has very little luck with them. He is attracted to Bren, but is too shy to reveal this to her for a long time. He is also a smoker and uses his need for a cigarette as an excuse to escape uncomfortable or surreal situations.

*Thelma Barlow as Dolly Bellfield
:Something of a social climber, Dolly is the cattiest of the dinner ladies, often making bitchy remarks about others. Prim and prudish, she previously worked at the upmarket Café Bonbon. She frequently snaps at people for using bad language and frowns on the sexual shenanigans of Twinkle, whom she is convinced did not have to work for her catering qualification. Overtly conservative, she believes everything she reads in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; without question, often quoting the articles she has read, and is prone to making remarks of dubious political correctness. She is fixated on her weight and dieting, although she is tempted to snack on Mars bars in stressful situations and it is revealed in several episodes that she was formerly obese. She has been married for thirty years to her husband Bob (Jack Smethurst), with whom she has a son named Stephen; it is implied that Stephen is in a homosexual relationship with his university roommate, Marcus, although this is a topic of embarrassment to Dolly, who seems to have reluctantly acknowledged the situation without truly accepting it. She hopes to move to the nearby upmarket village of Mobberley after her retirement.

*Anne Reid as Jean
:Dolly&#x27;s best friend, Jean is very often the stooge for her mordant remarks. She has a somewhat bawdy sense of humour and is long-sighted, but refuses to wear her glasses, so often misinterprets headlines when reading newspapers or magazines. She is unhappily married to her husband Keith (Peter Lorenzelli) at the start of the series, with grown-up daughter Lisa (Jane Hazlegrove), but in series two he leaves her for a Welsh dental hygienist named Bronwyn. After getting over the shock, which leaves her so depressed and irritable that her sister Peggy (Linda Bassett) is called in to take her to Tunstall to recuperate, Jean rediscovers her self-confidence and has a fling with security guard Barry (Howard Crossley), &quot;the love muscle&quot;, before settling down in a more solid relationship with Stan. She accepts his proposal in the final episode, and reveals that she has been asked to stay on at HWD Components to run the snack bar replacing the canteen.

*Maxine Peake as Twinkle
:The youngest member of the team, she frequently turns up late for work and tries unsuccessfully to scrounge cigarettes from Tony. Despite her snarky attitude, she regards the other members of staff as friends, particularly Bren, to whom she turns for help on several occasions, such as when she thinks she is pregnant. She lives with her disabled mother Bev (Jackie Downey), for whom she acts as carer, and often spends her evenings getting drunk and falling into skips. Something of a recalcitrant delinquent who often skipped school, she speaks with a heavy Manc accent and is also a closeted football fan.

*Shobna Gulati as Anita
:Pleasant, but rather dim and forgetful, Anita is a kind and loyal friend to her colleagues, empathising with them and often helping them to solve their problems without even realising it. She is somewhat desperate to have a family and children, becoming pregnant in the second series after a one-night stand with a visiting decorator (Kevin Maxwell) and, terrified of the implications, leaves the baby on the fire escape on Millennium Eve, attaching a note asking Bren to look after him. However, she quickly returns to take the baby back. She is a big fan of Celine Dion and is of a South Asian background.

*Duncan Preston as Stan Meadowcroft
:One of the factory&#x27;s maintenance men, Stan lives with his father Jim (Eric Sykes), a retired Desert Rat soldier of whom he often speaks. In the episode &quot;moods&quot;, Stan reveals that his mother ran off with a piano tuner in 1954, which his father never recovered from. He is particularly close to Bren as she seems to be the only one who knows how to successfully handle his changeable moods. After his father&#x27;s death he decides to get his life going again, embarking on a brief relationship with a nurse called Bobbi (Tina Malone) before dating, and ultimately proposing to, his colleague Jean, who accepts him in the final episode. Although he is well-meaning, Stan&#x27;s behaviour can occasionally verge on being chauvinistic, believing that he should perform physical labour. This stems from his belief that such tasks (among others, such as seeing animal carcasses) are not suitable for, as he puts it, &quot;female women&quot;.

*Celia Imrie as Philippa Moorcroft
:The scatty and disorganised manager of the Human Resources department, having apparently landed the job because she was in a relationship with the factory manager, Mr Michael, who she refers to as Mikey. Her well-meaning attempts to relieve the dinner ladies&#x27; stress or help them in their personal lives generally have the opposite effect: in the first episode, she tries to organise Scottish country dancing sessions. In the second series she decides to break up with Mr Michael, and later begins a relationship with a colleague, Tom Murray (Mark Drewry). Philippa is the only character in the series who comes from the south of England.

*Julie Walters as Petula Gordeno
:Bren&#x27;s selfish, manipulative, and delusional mother, who had Bren taken into foster care as a child because she was &quot;cramping her style&quot;, and claims that she lost the address of the orphanage. She sometimes seems to forget that Bren is her daughter, and usually turns up looking for money or a favour. She often claims to be a close friend (and usually lover) of the rich and famous, but in reality is a down-and-out who lives in a caravan behind a petrol station. In the first series, she has an affair with 16-year-old Clint (Kenny Doughty). In the second series, she gets involved with Reg (Kaleem Janjua), an Asian petrol station attendant, and claims to be pregnant with his child. In the final episode, she dies off-screen on 29 February 2000, after having been admitted to hospital on 7 February with three weeks to live. It is revealed that her real name was the same as Bren&#x27;s; Bren muses that she &quot;can&#x27;t have hated [her] that much&quot; if she named her after herself.

===Recurring===
*Sue Devaney as Jane
:A member of the planning department, she had a small but significant role in the first series, usually ordering the toast round for meetings. In the second series, she played a larger role, having an ongoing wager with the canteen staff on whether Bren and Tony would &quot;get it on&quot; by Christmas Eve. She reportedly had a drunken snog herself with Tony whilst on holiday in Marbella, now plays Bren &quot;(series 1)&quot; and Adrian Hood (series 2) as Norman

:Delivers bread to the canteen. Norman is dour, work-shy, agoraphobic and &quot;technically&quot; a bigamist. He often attributes his agoraphobia to an incident when he &quot;fell off a diving board in Guernsey&quot;. He also developed a fear of bread in the second series.

*Sue Cleaver as Glenda
:A bread supplier who often takes over Norman&#x27;s duties when his agoraphobia is plaguing him. She underwent bladder surgery, the nature of which is never directly mentioned. Tony often jokes that she is his &quot;fantasy woman&quot; and once claimed she bore a resemblance to the UK comic character Desperate Dan.

*Christopher Greet as Mr Michael
:Senior staff member of HWD Components; it is hinted that he is a manager or even managing director. He was in a relationship with Philippa, which was the reason she moved to Manchester. He is a fan of trad jazz, jigsaws, custard and Garibaldi biscuits.

*Bernard Wrigley as Bob
:A factory worker who appears at the counter in a number of episodes, usually asking for bacon or liver. He takes a mild interest in canteen gossip. and becomes a

*Steve Huison as Steve Greengrass
:A perennially unlucky individual considered a jinx by the rest of the factory. He was reluctantly invited on the Marbella trip by Jane, as his last three holidays were cancelled due to various unfortunate events, but he fell down a staircase after tripping on spilled orange juice Anita forgot to clean, resulting in a space being left open for Bren. Steve has to separate his food before eating it, an eccentricity that only adds to his alienation from his co-workers.

*Kate Robbins as Babs
:A friend of Petula&#x27;s from Urmston, with a possible learning disability and a vast knowledge of catering appliances, which briefly attracts Stan towards her. After accompanying Petula to the factory&#x27;s Christmas party uninvited (as was Petula), it is she who arrives to inform Bren that Petula&#x27;s caravan has exploded and she needs money, which leads to Bren forfeiting her place in the group holiday to Marbella

===Guest stars===
The ensemble cast occasionally featured notable guest actors, including Joanne Froggatt, Tina Malone, Dora Bryan, Lynda Baron, Elspet Gray, Janette Tough (of The Krankies fame), Henry Kelly, Simon Williams, Kenny Doughty, Lesley Nicol, Eric Sykes and Thora Hird.

==Production==
===Writing===

The series was written entirely by Victoria Wood, with no additional contributors or script editor. Wood approached writing by allowing plots to develop from interactions between characters, rather than fitting characters into pre-determined storylines.

She wrote the whole six-episode first series in one month; however, she found the second series much harder to write, and even though it had only four more episodes, it took her six months. Wood has attributed this to pressure to do everything herself and loneliness, and has said that she even considered giving up because she thought her scripts were of low quality.

Wood deliberately ended the programme after two series, and the final episode of the second was designed to conclude it. She has said that she &quot;[doesn&#x27;t] normally do anything twice&quot;, but felt that a second series was necessary to do the show justice, and that she knew where to take the show after seeing it air and understanding &quot;what people [have] taken from it&quot;. She mentioned the short run of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; when explaining why she planned not to continue the series further. However, in a televised BBC TV documentary about the history of situation comedy at the corporation, Wood complained that the series had been axed by the BBC, despite it being what she described as &quot;a show they couldn&#x27;t kill&quot;.

===Filming===
Involving only one set throughout its run (with the exception of quiz show and hospital sets which are both seen on a television screen in the last two episodes), &quot;dinnerladies&quot; was entirely filmed at the London BBC Television Centre in front of a live studio audience, employing a multiple-camera setup. Other locations such as characters&#x27; homes and other parts of the factory are only referred to in conversation.

The set was intended to be as realistic as possible, and even featured a functioning catering toaster from which the studio audience were served toast during filming.

Punchlines were generally delivered at a fast pace with dialogue usually only pausing to allow audience laughter to settle. Each episode was filmed twice in front of two separate audiences, once on a Friday and again on a Saturday. This gave cast members two attempts to perfect a scene and, if necessary, the opportunity to correct mistakes without having to repeat a joke to the same audience. This also gave Wood the opportunity to make script changes that she felt might improve each episode.

The series&#x27; director and producer was Geoff Posner, and the executive producers were Philip McIntyre and David Tyler; the programme was co-produced by Victoria Wood&#x27;s production company Good Fun and Posner&#x27;s Pozzitive Television.

Wood reprised her character Bren for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Shaggy Dog Story&quot; in 1999.

===Music===

The show&#x27;s theme music was composed by Victoria Wood. It is usually played without lyrics, but at the end of the episodes &quot;Minnellium&quot; and &quot;Toast&quot;, vocals which were also written and performed by Wood were included.

==Themes==

Humour is mostly derived from the conversation and banter between characters, regarding their lives and popular culture, most commonly film and television: dialogue often features humorous misunderstandings, malapropisms and sexual innuendos. The series also features various surreal situations, often involving Bren&#x27;s mother.

There is also a counterpoint of sadder themes, including deaths in the families of two of the main characters, a painful divorce, one of the characters living with cancer, one character having an unplanned pregnancy, and the underlying heartache in Bren&#x27;s childhood. Bren and Tony&#x27;s relationship seems to be eternally thwarted either by themselves or random circumstance.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;dinnerladies&quot; was generally well-received, and was praised by critic Tom Paulin.

===Ratings===
The viewing figures for series 1 peaked with its premiere at 12.24 million viewers, and series 2 peaked with &quot;Minnellium&quot;, which aired on 30 December 1999 and reached 15.33 million viewers.

===Awards===
The first series won the 1999 Rose d&#x27;Or Press Award and &quot;Best New TV Comedy&quot; at the 1999 British Comedy Awards, and the second won &quot;Best TV Comedy&quot; in 2000. The show has also been nominated for the British Academy Television Award for &quot;Best Comedy (Programme or Series)&quot; and the &quot;Situation Comedy Award&quot; in 1998 and 1999 respectively. It came 28th in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; poll in 2004.

==Theatre==
A play based on the series premiered in London in April 2009. The play was based on three episodes of the second series of the TV show, and concentrated on the romance between Bren and Tony. It was directed by David Graham, who also adapted Victoria Wood&#x27;s original TV scripts for the stage. Gulati and Dunn reprised their original roles from the TV series. The show toured the UK during 2009.

A second show called &quot;Dinnerladies: Second Helpings&quot; toured in 2011 with a new script, once again featuring Dunn, joined by original series cast member Sue Devaney. Shobna Gulati left to return to the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

<text>Triglav National Park (TNP; ) is the only national park in Slovenia. It was established in its modern form in 1981 and is located in the northwestern part of the country, respectively the southeastern part of the Alpine massif. Mount Triglav, the highest peak of the Julian Alps, stands almost in the middle of the national park. From there the valleys spread out radially, supplying water to two large river systems with their sources in the Julian Alps: the Soča and the Sava, flowing to the Adriatic and Black Sea, respectively.

==History==
The proposal for the protection of the Triglav Lakes Valley area was first put forward by the seismologist Albin Belar in 1906 or 1908. However, the proposal was not accepted, as there was no legal base for it and the laws of the time prohibited any restriction of pasture. The strategic basis for the protection of the area, titled &quot;The Memorandum&quot; (), and which explicitly mentioned the proposal of Belar, was submitted to the Provincial Government for Slovenia in 1920. The idea was finally implemented in 1924. Then, at an initiative by the Nature Protection Section of the Slovene Museum Society together with the Slovene Mountaineering Society, a twenty-year lease was taken out on the Triglav Lakes Valley area, some 14 km². It was destined to become an &quot;Alpine Conservation Park&quot;; however, permanent conservation was not possible at that time. The name &quot;Triglavski narodni park&quot; was first used in 1926 by Fran Jesenko.

In 1961, after many years of effort, the protection was renewed (this time on a permanent basis) and somewhat enlarged, embracing around 20 km². The protected area was officially designated as &quot;Triglav National Park&quot;. It was named after Mount Triglav, a symbol of Slovenia and of Slovene character. However, all objectives of a true national park were not attained and for that reason over the next two decades new proposals for expanding and modifying this protection were put forward.

Finally, in 1981, Triglav National Park was officially established in the modern form. A rearrangement was achieved and the park was given a new concept and expanded to 838 km². In 2010, the park expanded to include the settlement Kneške Ravne (Tolmin), according to wishes of its inhabitants, thus the new park area amounts to 880 km², which is 4% of the area of Slovenia.

==Biodiversity==

=== Flora ===
Systematic surveys of plants, especially of ethnobotanically useful species, in Triglav National Park have been carried out by Chandra Prakash Kala and Petra Ratajc covering various microhabitats, elevations, aspects, and terrain types. The park has over fifty-nine species of ethnobotanical values, of these 37 species (which contribute 62%) fall under four major categories of medicinal plants as per the &quot;Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia&quot; such as H, Z, ZR and ND. Some important species such as &quot;Aconitum napellus&quot;, &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;, and &quot;Taxus baccata&quot; are not allowed to be collected and used as per the &quot;Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia&quot;.

==Hydrology==
Waters in Triglav National Park consist of two watersheds: the Sava River watershed and the Soča River watershed.
Many waterfalls can be found in the park, and most of them are located in the valleys of Soča River and its tributaries. The highest waterfall is Boka Falls (106 m). The Tolmin Gorges on the Tolminka River are located in the national park.

The lakes in the park are all of glacial origin. The largest among them is Lake Bohinj. Others are the Triglav Lakes (located in the Triglav Lakes Valley), Lake Krn, and Lower and Upper Križ Lake.

<text>Naples ( ; ; ) is the regional capital of Campania and the third-largest city of Italy, after Rome and Milan, with a population of 909,048 within the city&#x27;s administrative limits as of 2022. Its province-level municipality is the third most populous metropolitan city in Italy with a population of 3,115,320 residents, and its metropolitan area stretches beyond the boundaries of the city wall for approximately . Naples plays also a key international role in international diplomacy, since it is home to NATO&#x27;s Allied Joint Force Command Naples and of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean.

Founded by Greeks in the first millennium BC, Naples is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world. In the eighth century BC, a colony known as Parthenope () was established on the Pizzofalcone hill. In the sixth century BC, it was refounded as Neápolis. The city was an important part of Magna Graecia, played a major role in the merging of Greek and Roman society, and was a significant cultural centre under the Romans.

Naples served as the capital of the Duchy of Naples (661–1139), subsequently as the capital of the Kingdom of Naples (1282–1816), and finally as the capital of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies — until the unification of Italy in 1861. Naples is also considered a capital of the Baroque, beginning with the artist Caravaggio&#x27;s career in the 17th century and the artistic revolution he inspired. It was also an important centre of humanism and Enlightenment. The city has long been a global point of reference for classical music and opera through the Neapolitan School. Between 1925 and 1936, Naples was expanded and upgraded by the Fascist regime. During the later years of World War II, it sustained severe damage from Allied bombing as they invaded the peninsula. The city underwent extensive reconstruction work after the war.

Since the late 20th century, Naples has had significant economic growth, helped by the construction of the Centro Direzionale business district and an advanced transportation network, which includes the Alta Velocità high-speed rail link to Rome and Salerno and an expanded subway network. Naples is the third-largest urban economy in Italy by GDP, after Milan and Rome. The Port of Naples is one of the most important in Europe.

Naples&#x27; historic city centre has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A wide range of culturally and historically significant sites are nearby, including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Naples is undoubtedly one of the world&#x27;s cities with the highest density of cultural, artistic, and monumental resources, described by the BBC as &quot;the Italian city with too much history to handle.&quot;

== History ==

=== Greek birth and Roman acquisition ===


Naples has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. In the second millennium BC, a first Mycenaean settlement arose not far from the geographical position of the future city of Parthenope.

Sailors from the Greek island of Rhodes established probably a small commercial port called Parthenope (, meaning &quot;Pure Eyes&quot;, a Siren in Greek mythology) on the island of Megaride in the ninth century BC. By the eighth century BC, the settlement was expanded by Cumaeans, as evidenced by the archaeological findings, to include Monte Echia. In the sixth century BC the city was refounded as Neápolis (), eventually becoming one of the foremost cities of Magna Graecia.

The city grew rapidly due to the influence of the powerful Greek city-state of Syracuse, and became an ally of the Roman Republic against Carthage. During the Samnite Wars, the city, now a bustling centre of trade, was captured by the Samnites; however, the Romans soon captured the city from them and made it a Roman colony. During the Punic Wars, the strong walls surrounding Neápolis repelled the invading forces of the Carthaginian general Hannibal.

The Romans greatly respected Naples as a paragon of Hellenistic culture. During the Roman era, the people of Naples maintained their Greek language and customs. At the same time, the city was expanded with elegant Roman villas, aqueducts, and public baths. Landmarks such as the Temple of Dioscures were built, and many emperors chose to holiday in the city, including Claudius and Tiberius. Virgil, the author of Rome&#x27;s national epic, the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, received part of his education in the city, and later resided in its environs.

It was during this period that Christianity first arrived in Naples; the apostles Peter and Paul are said to have preached in the city. Januarius, who would become Naples&#x27; patron saint, was martyred there in the fourth century AD. The last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, Romulus Augustulus, was exiled to Naples by the Germanic king Odoacer in the fifth century AD.

=== Duchy of Naples ===
Following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, Naples was captured by the Ostrogoths, a Germanic people, and incorporated into the Ostrogothic Kingdom. However, Belisarius of the Byzantine Empire recaptured Naples in 536, after entering the city via an aqueduct.

In 543, during the Gothic Wars, Totila briefly took the city for the Ostrogoths, but the Byzantines seized control of the area following the Battle of Mons Lactarius on the slopes of Vesuvius. Naples was expected to keep in contact with the Exarchate of Ravenna, which was the centre of Byzantine power on the Italian Peninsula.

After the exarchate fell, a Duchy of Naples was created. Although Naples&#x27; Greco-Roman culture endured, it eventually switched allegiance from Constantinople to Rome under Duke Stephen II, putting it under papal suzerainty by 763.

The years between 818 and 832 saw tumultuous relations with the Byzantine Emperor, with numerous local pretenders feuding for possession of the ducal throne. Theoctistus was appointed without imperial approval; his appointment was later revoked and Theodore II took his place. However, the disgruntled general populace chased him from the city and elected Stephen III instead, a man who minted coins with his initials rather than those of the Byzantine Emperor. Naples gained complete independence by the early ninth century. Naples allied with the Muslim Saracens in 836 and asked for their support to repel the siege of Lombard troops coming from the neighbouring Duchy of Benevento. However, during the 850s, Muslim general Muhammad I Abu &#x27;l-Abbas sacked Miseno, but only for Khums purposes (Islamic booty), without conquering the territories of Campania.

The duchy was under the direct control of the Lombards for a brief period after the capture by Pandulf IV of the Principality of Capua, a long-term rival of Naples; however, this regime lasted only three years before the Greco-Roman-influenced dukes were reinstated. By the 11th century, Naples had begun to employ Norman mercenaries to battle their rivals; Duke Sergius IV hired Rainulf Drengot to wage war on Capua for him.

By 1137, the Normans had attained great influence in Italy, controlling previously independent principalities and duchies such as Capua, Benevento, Salerno, Amalfi, Sorrento and Gaeta; it was in this year that Naples, the last independent duchy in the southern part of the peninsula, came under Norman control. The last ruling duke of the duchy, Sergius VII, was forced to surrender to Roger II, who had been proclaimed King of Sicily by Antipope Anacletus II seven years earlier. Naples thus joined the Kingdom of Sicily, with Palermo as the capital.

=== As part of the Kingdom of Sicily ===

After a period of Norman rule, in 1189, the Kingdom of Sicily was in a succession dispute between Tancred, King of Sicily of an illegitimate birth and the Hohenstaufens, a Germanic royal house, as its Prince Henry had married Princess Constance the last legitimate heir to the Sicilian throne. In 1191 Henry invaded Sicily after being crowned as Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and many cities surrendered. Still, Naples resisted him from May to August under the leadership of Richard, Count of Acerra, Nicholas of Ajello, Aligerno Cottone and Margaritus of Brindisi before the Germans suffered from disease and were forced to retreat. Conrad II, Duke of Bohemia and Philip I, Archbishop of Cologne died of disease during the siege. During his counterattack, Tancred captured Constance, now empress. He had the empress imprisoned at Castel dell&#x27;Ovo at Naples before her release on May 1192 under the pressure of Pope Celestine III. In 1194 Henry started his second campaign upon the death of Tancred, but this time Aligerno surrendered without resistance, and finally, Henry conquered Sicily, putting it under the rule of Hohenstaufens.

The University of Naples, the first university in Europe dedicated to training secular administrators, was founded by Frederick II, making Naples the intellectual centre of the kingdom. Conflict between the Hohenstaufens and the Papacy led in 1266 to Pope Innocent IV crowning the Angevin duke Charles I King of Sicily: Charles officially moved the capital from Palermo to Naples, where he resided at the Castel Nuovo. Having a great interest in architecture, Charles I imported French architects and workmen and was personally involved in several building projects in the city. Many examples of Gothic architecture sprang up around Naples, including the Naples Cathedral, which remains the city&#x27;s main church.

=== Kingdom of Naples ===
In 1282, after the Sicilian Vespers, the Kingdom of Sicily was divided into two. The Angevin Kingdom of Naples included the southern part of the Italian peninsula, while the island of Sicily became the Aragonese Kingdom of Sicily. Wars between the competing dynasties continued until the Peace of Caltabellotta in 1302, which saw Frederick III recognised as king of Sicily, while Charles II was recognised as king of Naples by Pope Boniface VIII. Despite the split, Naples grew in importance, attracting Pisan and Genoese merchants, Tuscan bankers, and some of the most prominent Renaissance artists of the time, such as Boccaccio, Petrarch and Giotto. During the 14th century, the Hungarian Angevin king Louis the Great captured the city several times. In 1442, Alfonso I conquered Naples after his victory against the last Angevin king, René, and Naples was unified with Sicily again for a brief period.

==== Aragonese and Spanish ====
Sicily and Naples were separated since 1282, but remained dependencies of Aragon under Ferdinand I. The new dynasty enhanced Naples&#x27; commercial standing by establishing relations with the Iberian Peninsula. Naples also became a centre of the Renaissance, with artists such as Laurana, da Messina, Sannazzaro and Poliziano arriving in the city. In 1501, Naples came under direct rule from France under Louis XII, with the Neapolitan king Frederick being taken as a prisoner to France; however, this state of affairs did not last long, as Spain won Naples from the French at the Battle of Garigliano in 1503.


Following the Spanish victory, Naples became part of the Spanish Empire, and remained so throughout the Spanish Habsburg period. The Spanish sent viceroys to Naples to directly deal with local issues: the most important of these viceroys was Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, who was responsible for considerable social, economic and urban reforms in the city; he also tried to introduce the Inquisition. In 1544, around 7,000 people were taken as slaves by Barbary pirates and brought to the Barbary Coast of North Africa (see Sack of Naples).

By the 17th century, Naples had become Europe&#x27;s second-largest city – second only to Paris – and the largest European Mediterranean city, with around 250,000 inhabitants. The city was a major cultural centre during the Baroque era, being home to artists such as Caravaggio, Salvator Rosa and Bernini, philosophers such as Bernardino Telesio, Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella and Giambattista Vico, and writers such as Giambattista Marino. A revolution led by the local fisherman Masaniello saw the creation of a brief independent Neapolitan Republic in 1647. However, this lasted only a few months before Spanish rule was reasserted. In 1656, an outbreak of bubonic plague killed about half of Naples&#x27; 300,000 inhabitants.
In 1714, Spanish rule over Naples came to an end as a result of the War of the Spanish Succession; the Austrian Charles VI ruled the city from Vienna through viceroys of his own. However, the War of the Polish Succession saw the Spanish regain Sicily and Naples as part of a personal union, with the 1738 Treaty of Vienna recognising the two polities as independent under a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons.

In 1755, the Duke of Noja commissioned an accurate topographic map of Naples, later known as the Map of the Duke of Noja, employing rigorous surveying accuracy and becoming an essential urban planning tool for Naples.

During the time of Ferdinand IV, the effects of the French Revolution were felt in Naples: Horatio Nelson, an ally of the Bourbons, arrived in the city in 1798 to warn against the French republicans. Ferdinand was forced to retreat and fled to Palermo, where he was protected by a British fleet. However, Naples&#x27; lower class &quot;lazzaroni&quot; were strongly pious and royalist, favouring the Bourbons; in the that followed, they fought the Neapolitan pro-Republican aristocracy, causing a civil war.

Eventually, the Republicans conquered Castel Sant&#x27;Elmo and proclaimed a Parthenopaean Republic, secured by the French Army. A counter-revolutionary religious army of &quot;lazzaroni&quot; known as the &quot;sanfedisti&quot; under Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo was raised; they met with great success, and the French were forced to surrender the Neapolitan castles, with their fleet sailing back to Toulon.

Ferdinand IV was restored as king; however, after only seven years, Napoleon conquered the kingdom and installed Bonapartist kings, including installing his brother Joseph Bonaparte. With the help of the Austrian Empire and its allies, the Bonapartists were defeated in the Neapolitan War. Ferdinand IV once again regained the throne and the kingdom.

==== Independent Two Sicilies ====

The Congress of Vienna in 1815 saw the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily combine to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, with Naples as the capital city. In 1839, Naples became the first city on the Italian Peninsula to have a railway, with the construction of the Naples–Portici railway.

=== Italian unification to the present day ===
After the Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, which culminated in the controversial siege of Gaeta, Naples became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 as part of the Italian unification, ending the era of Bourbon rule. The economy of the area formerly known as the Two Sicilies as dependant on agriculture suffered the international pressure on prices of wheat, and together with lower sea fares prices lead to an unprecedented wave of emigration, with an estimated 4 million people emigrating from the Naples area between 1876 and 1913. In the forty years following unification, the population of Naples grew by only 26%, vs. 63% for Turin and 103% for Milan; however, by 1884, Naples was still the largest city in Italy with 496,499 inhabitants, or roughly 64,000 per square kilometre (more than twice the population density of Paris).

Public health conditions in certain areas of the city were poor, with twelve epidemics of cholera and typhoid fever claiming some 48,000 people between 1834 and 1884. A death rate 31.84 per thousand, high even for the time, insisted in the absence of epidemics between 1878 and 1883. Then in 1884, Naples fell victim to a major cholera epidemic, caused largely by the city&#x27;s poor sewerage infrastructure. In response to these problems, in 1885, the government prompted a radical transformation of the city called &quot;risanamento&quot; to improve the sewerage infrastructure and replace the most clustered areas, considered the main cause of , with large and airy avenues. The project proved difficult to accomplish politically and economically due to corruption, as shown in the Saredo Inquiry, land speculation and extremely long bureaucracy. This led to the project to massive delays with contrasting results. The most notable transformations made were the construction of Via Caracciolo in place of the beach along the promenade, the creation of Galleria Umberto I and and the construction of Corso Umberto.
Naples was the most-bombed Italian city during World War II. Though Neapolitans did not rebel under Italian Fascism, Naples was the first Italian city to rise up against German military occupation; for the first time in Europe, the Nazis, whose leader in this case was Colonel Scholl, negotiated a surrender in the face of insurgents. The city was already completely freed by 1 October 1943, when British and American forces entered the city. Departing Germans burned the library of the university, as well as the Italian Royal Society. They also destroyed the city archives. Time bombs planted throughout the city continued to explode into November. The symbol of the rebirth of Naples was the rebuilding of the church of Santa Chiara, which had been destroyed in a United States Army Air Corps bombing raid.

Special funding from the Italian government&#x27;s Fund for the South was provided from 1950 to 1984, helping the Neapolitan economy to improve somewhat, with city landmarks such as the Piazza del Plebiscito being renovated. However, high unemployment continues to affect Naples.

Italian media attributed the city&#x27;s recent illegal waste disposal issues to the Camorra, the organized crime network centered in Campania. Due to illegal waste dumping, as exposed by Roberto Saviano in his book &quot;Gomorrah&quot;, severe environmental contamination and increased health risks remain prevalent. In 2007, Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s government held senior meetings in Naples to demonstrate their intention to solve these problems. However, the late-2000s recession had a severe impact on the city, intensifying its waste-management and unemployment problems. By August 2011, the number of unemployed in the Naples area had risen to 250,000, sparking public protests against the economic situation. In June 2012, allegations of blackmail, extortion, and illicit contract tendering emerged concerning the city&#x27;s waste management issues.

Naples hosted the sixth World Urban Forum in September 2012 and the 63rd International Astronautical Congress in October 2012. In 2013, it was the host of the Universal Forum of Cultures and the host for the 2019 Summer Universiade.

== Architecture ==
=== UNESCO World Heritage Site ===
Naples&#x27; 2,800-year history has left it with a wealth of historical buildings and monuments, from medieval castles to classical ruins, and a wide range of culturally and historically significant sites nearby, including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum. In 2017 the BBC defined Naples as &quot;the Italian city with too much history to handle&quot;.

The most prominent forms of architecture visible in present-day Naples are the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque styles. Naples has a total of 448 historical churches (1000 in total), making it one of the most Catholic cities in the world in terms of the number of places of worship. In 1995, the historic centre of Naples was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, a United Nations programme which aims to catalogue and conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind.
=== Piazzas, palaces and castles ===
The main city square or &quot;piazza&quot; of the city is the Piazza del Plebiscito. Its construction was begun by the Bonapartist king Joachim Murat and finished by the Bourbon king Ferdinand IV. The piazza is bounded on the east by the Royal Palace and on the west by the church of San Francesco di Paola, with the colonnades extending on both sides. Nearby is the Teatro di San Carlo, which is the oldest opera house in Italy. Directly across San Carlo is Galleria Umberto.

Naples is well known for its castles: The most ancient is Castel dell&#x27;Ovo (&quot;Egg Castle&quot;), which was built on the tiny islet of Megarides, where the original Cumaean colonists had founded the city. In Roman times the islet became part of Lucullus&#x27;s villa, later hosting Romulus Augustulus, the exiled last western Roman emperor. It had also been the prison for Empress Constance between 1191 and 1192 after her being captured by Sicilians, and Conradin and Giovanna I of Naples before their executions.

Castel Nuovo, also known as &quot;Maschio Angioino&quot;, is one of the city&#x27;s top landmarks; it was built during the time of Charles I, the first king of Naples. Castel Nuovo has seen many notable historical events: for example, in 1294, Pope Celestine V resigned as pope in a hall of the castle, and following this Pope Boniface VIII was elected pope by the cardinal collegium, before moving to Rome.

Castel Capuano was built in the 12th century by William I, the son of Roger II of Sicily, the first monarch of the Kingdom of Naples. It was expanded by Frederick II and became one of his royal palaces. The castle was the residence of many kings and queens throughout its history. In the 16th century, it became the Hall of Justice.

Another Neapolitan castle is Castel Sant&#x27;Elmo, which was completed in 1329 and is built in the shape of a star. Its strategic position overlooking the entire city made it a target of various invaders. During the uprising of Masaniello in 1647, the Spanish took refuge in Sant&#x27;Elmo to escape the revolutionaries.

The Carmine Castle, built in 1392 and highly modified in the 16th century by the Spanish, was demolished in 1906 to make room for the Via Marina, although two of the castle&#x27;s towers remain as a monument. The Vigliena Fort, built in 1702, was destroyed in 1799 during the royalist war against the Parthenopean Republic and is now abandoned and in ruin.

=== Museums ===

Naples is widely known for its wealth of historical museums. The Naples National Archaeological Museum is one of the city&#x27;s main museums, with one of the most extensive collections of artefacts of the Roman Empire in the world. It also houses many of the antiques unearthed at Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as some artefacts from the Greek and Renaissance periods.

Previously a Bourbon palace, now a museum and art gallery, the Museo di Capodimonte is another museum of note. The gallery features paintings from the 13th to the 18th centuries, including major works by Simone Martini, Raphael, Titian, Caravaggio, El Greco, Jusepe de Ribera and Luca Giordano. The royal apartments are furnished with antique 18th-century furniture and a collection of porcelain and majolica from the various royal residences: the famous Capodimonte Porcelain Factory once stood just adjacent to the palace.

In front of the Royal Palace of Naples stands the Galleria Umberto I, which contains the Coral Jewellery Museum. Occupying a 19th-century palazzo renovated by the Portuguese architect Álvaro Siza, the Museo d&#x27;Arte Contemporanea Donnaregina (MADRE) features an enfilade procession of permanent installations by artists such as Francesco Clemente, Richard Serra, and Rebecca Horn. The 16th-century palace of Roccella hosts the Palazzo delle Arti Napoli, which contains the civic collections of art belonging to the City of Naples, and features temporary exhibits of art and culture. Palazzo Como, which dates from the 15th century, hosts the Museo Civico Filangieri of plastic arts, created in 1883 by Gaetano Filangieri.

=== Churches and other religious structures ===

Naples is the seat of the Archdiocese of Naples; there are hundreds of churches in the city. The Cathedral of Naples is the city&#x27;s premier place of worship; each year on 19 September, it hosts the longstanding Miracle of Saint Januarius, the city&#x27;s patron saint. During the miracle, which thousands of Neapolitans flock to witness, the dried blood of Januarius is said to turn to liquid when brought close to holy relics said to be of his body.

=== Other features ===

Aside from the Piazza del Plebiscito, Naples has two other major public squares: the Piazza Dante and the Piazza dei Martiri. The latter originally had only a memorial to religious martyrs, but in 1866, after the Italian unification, four lions were added, representing the four rebellions against the Bourbons.

The San Gennaro dei Poveri is a Renaissance-era hospital for the poor, erected by the Spanish in 1667. It was the forerunner of a much more ambitious project, the Bourbon Hospice for the Poor started by Charles III. This was for the destitute and ill of the city; it also provided a self-sufficient community where the poor would live and work. Though a notable landmark, it is no longer a functioning hospital.

==== Subterranean Naples ====
Underneath Naples lies a series of caves and structures created by centuries of mining, and the city rests atop a major geothermal zone. There are also several ancient Greco-Roman reservoirs dug out from the soft tufo stone on which, and from which, much of the city is built. Approximately of the many kilometres of tunnels under the city can be visited from the Napoli Sotteranea, situated in the historic centre of the city in Via dei Tribunali. This system of tunnels and cisterns underlies most of the city and lies approximately below ground level. During World War II, these tunnels were used as air-raid shelters, and there are inscriptions on the walls depicting the suffering endured by the refugees of that era.

There are large catacombs in and around the city, and other landmarks such as the Piscina Mirabilis, the main cistern serving the Bay of Naples during Roman times.

Several archaeological excavations are also present; they revealed in San Lorenzo Maggiore the macellum of Naples, and in Santa Chiara, the biggest thermal complex of the city in Roman times.

==== Parks, gardens, villas, fountains and stairways ====
Of the various public parks in Naples, the most prominent are the Villa Comunale, which was built by the Bourbon king Ferdinand IV in the 1780s; the park was originally a &quot;Royal Garden&quot;, reserved for members of the royal family, but open to the public on special holidays. The Bosco di Capodimonte, the city&#x27;s largest green space, served as a royal hunting reserve. The Park has 16 additional historical buildings, including residences, lodges, churches, fountains, statues, orchards and woods.

Another important park is the Parco Virgiliano, which looks towards the tiny volcanic islet of Nisida; beyond Nisida lie Procida and Ischia. Parco Virgiliano was named after Virgil, the classical Roman poet and Latin writer who is thought to be entombed nearby. Naples is noted for its numerous stately villas, fountains and stairways, such as the Neoclassical Villa Floridiana, the Fountain of Neptune and the Pedamentina stairway.

==== Neo-Gothic, &quot;Liberty Napoletano&quot; and modern architecture ====
Various buildings inspired by the Gothic Revival are extant in Naples, due to the influence that this movement had on the Scottish-Indian architect Lamont Young, one of the most active Neapolitan architects of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Young left a significant footprint in the cityscape and designed many urban projects, such as the city&#x27;s first subway (metro).

In the first years of the 20th century, a local version of the Art Nouveau phenomenon, known as &quot;Liberty Napoletano&quot;, developed in the city, creating many buildings which still stand today. In 1935, the Rationalist architect Luigi Cosenza designed a new fish market for the city. During the Benito Mussolini era, the first structures of the city&#x27;s &quot;service center&quot; were built, all in a Rationalist-Functionalist style, including the Palazzo delle Poste and the Pretura buildings. The Centro Direzionale di Napoli is the only adjacent cluster of skyscrapers in southern Europe.

== Geography ==

The city is situated on the Gulf of Naples, on the western coast of southern Italy; it rises from sea level to an elevation of . The small rivers that formerly crossed the city&#x27;s centre have since been covered by construction. It lies between two notable volcanic regions, Mount Vesuvius and the Campi Flegrei (&quot;Phlegraean Fields&quot;). Campi Flegrei is considered a supervolcano. The islands of Procida, Capri and Ischia can all be reached from Naples by hydrofoils and ferries. Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast are situated south of the city. At the same time, the Roman ruins of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis and Stabiae, which were destroyed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, are also visible nearby. The port towns of Pozzuoli and Baia, which were part of the Roman naval facility of Portus Julius, lie to the west of the city.

=== Quarters ===
The thirty quarters (&quot;quartieri&quot;) of Naples are listed below. For administrative purposes, these thirty districts are grouped together into ten governmental community boards.


=== Climate ===
Naples has a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) in the Köppen climate classification. The climate and fertility of the Gulf of Naples made the region famous during Roman times, when emperors such as Claudius and Tiberius holidayed near the city. Maritime features mitigate the winters but occasionally cause heavy rainfall, particularly in the autumn and winter. Summers feature high temperatures and humidity.

Winters are mild, and snow is rare in the city area but frequent on Mount Vesuvius. November is the wettest month in Naples, while July is the driest.

== Demographics ==
, the population of the &quot;comune di Napoli&quot; totals around 910,000. Naples&#x27; wider metropolitan area, sometimes known as Greater Naples, has a population of approximately 4.4 million. The demographic profile for the Neapolitan province in general is relatively young: 19% are under the age of 14, while 13% are over 65, compared to the national average of 14% and 19%, respectively. Naples has a higher percentage of females (52.5%) than males (47.5%). Naples currently has a higher birth rate than other parts of Italy, with 10.46 births per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

Naples&#x27;s population rose from 621,000 in 1901 to 1,226,000 in 1971, declining to 910,000 in 2022 as city dwellers moved to the suburbs. According to different sources, Naples&#x27; metropolitan area is either the second-most-populated metropolitan area in Italy after Milan (with 4,434,136 inhabitants according to Svimez Data) or the third (with 3.5 million inhabitants according to the OECD). In addition, Naples is Italy&#x27;s most densely populated major city, with approximately 8,182 people per square kilometre; however, it has seen a notable decline in population density since 2003, when the figure was over 9,000 people per square kilometre.
In contrast to many northern Italian cities, there are relatively few foreign immigrants in Naples; 94.3% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants are Italian nationals. In 2023, there were a total of 56,153 foreigners in the city of Naples; the majority of these are mostly from Sri Lanka, China, Ukraine, Pakistan and Romania. Statistics show that, in the past, the vast majority of immigrants in Naples were female; this happened because male immigrants in Italy tended to head to the wealthier north.

== Education ==

Naples is noted for its numerous higher education institutes and research centres. Naples hosts what is thought to be the oldest state university in the world, in the form of the University of Naples Federico II, which was founded by Frederick II in 1224. The university is among the most prominent in Italy, with around 70,000 students and over 6,000 professors in 2022. It is host to the Botanical Garden of Naples, which was opened in 1807 by Joseph Bonaparte, using plans drawn up under the Bourbon king Ferdinand IV. The garden&#x27;s 15 hectares feature around 25,000 samples of over 10,000 species.

Naples is also served by the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, a modern university which opened in 1989, and which has strong links to the nearby province of Caserta. Another notable centre of education is the University of Naples &quot;L&#x27;Orientale&quot;, which specialises in Eastern culture, and was founded by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ripa in 1732, after he returned from the court of Kangxi, the emperor of the Manchu Qing dynasty of China.

Other prominent universities in Naples include the Parthenope University of Naples, the private Suor Orsola Benincasa University of Naples, and the Jesuit Theological Seminary of Southern Italy. The San Pietro a Maiella music conservatory is the city&#x27;s foremost institution of musical education; the earliest Neapolitan music conservatories were founded in the 16th century under the Spanish. The Academy of Fine Arts located on the Via Santa Maria di Costantinopoli is the city&#x27;s foremost art school and one of the oldest in Italy. Naples hosts also the Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte, established in 1812 by the king Joachim Murat and the astronomer Federigo Zuccari, the oldest marine zoological study station in the world, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, created in 1872 by German scientist Anton Dohrn, and the world&#x27;s oldest permanent volcano observatory, the Vesuvius Observatory, founded in 1841. The Observatory lies on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, near the city of Ercolano, and is now a permanent specialised institute of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics.

== Politics ==


=== Governance ===
Each of the 7,896 &quot;comune&quot; in Italy is today represented locally by a city council headed by an elected mayor, known as a &quot;sindaco&quot; and informally called the first citizen (&quot;primo cittadino&quot;). This system, or one very similar to it, has been in place since the invasion of Italy by Napoleonic forces in 1808. When the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was restored, the system was kept in place with members of the nobility filling mayoral roles. By the end of the 19th century, party politics had begun to emerge; during the fascist era, each commune was represented by a &quot;podestà&quot;. Since World War II, the political landscape of Naples has been neither strongly right-wing nor left-wing – both Christian democrats and democratic socialists have governed the city at different times, with roughly equal frequency. Since the early 1990s, the mayors of Naples have all belonged to left-wing or center-left political groups.

Since 2021, the mayor of Naples is Gaetano Manfredi, an independent politician candidated by the center-left coalition, former minister of university and research in the second Conte government, and former rector of the University of Naples Federico II.

=== Administrative subdivisions ===
== Economy ==

Naples, within its administrative limits, is Italy&#x27;s fourth-largest economy after Milan, Rome and Turin, and is the world&#x27;s 103rd-largest urban economy by purchasing power, with an estimated 2011 GDP of US$83.6 billion, equivalent to $28,749 per capita. Naples is a major cargo terminal, and the port of Naples is one of the Mediterranean&#x27;s largest and busiest. The city has experienced significant economic growth since World War II, but joblessness remains a major problem, and the city is characterised by high levels of political corruption and organised crime.

Naples is a major national, and international tourist destination, one of Italy&#x27;s and Europe&#x27;s top tourist cities. Tourists began visiting Naples in the 18th century during the Grand Tour.

In the last decades, there has been a move away from a traditional agriculture-based economy in the province of Naples to one based on service industries. The service sector employs the majority of Neapolitans, although more than half of these are small enterprises with fewer than 20 workers; about 70 companies are said to be medium-sized with more than 200 workers, and about 15 have more than 500 workers.

=== Tourism ===
Naples is, with Florence, Rome, Venice and Milan, one of the main Italian tourist destinations. With 3,700,000 visitors in 2018, the city has completely emerged from the strong tourist depression of past decades (due primarily to the unilateral destination of an industrial city but also due to the damage to the city&#x27;s image caused by the Italian media, from the 1980 Irpinia earthquake and the waste crisis, in favour of the coastal centres of its metropolitan area). To adequately assess the phenomenon, however, it must be considered that a large slice of tourists visit Naples per year, staying in the numerous localities in its surroundings, connected to the city with both private and public direct lines. Daily visits to Naples are carried out by various Roman tour operators and by all the main tourist resorts of Campania: as of 2019, Naples is the tenth most visited municipality in Italy and the first in the South.

The sector is constantly growing and the prospect of reaching the art cities of its level is once again expected in a relatively short time; tourism is increasingly assuming a decisive weight for the city&#x27;s economy, which is why, exactly as happened for example in the case of Venice or Florence, the risk of gentrification of the historic centre is now high.

== Transport ==


Naples is served by several major motorways (it: &quot;autostrade&quot;). The Autostrada A1, the longest motorway in Italy, links Naples to Milan. The A3 runs southwards from Naples to Salerno, where the motorway to Reggio Calabria begins, while the A16 runs east to Canosa. The A16 is nicknamed the &quot;autostrada dei Due Mari&quot; (&quot;Motorway of the Two Seas&quot;) because it connects the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Adriatic Sea.

Suburban rail services are provided by Trenitalia, Circumvesuviana, Ferrovia Cumana and Metronapoli.

The city&#x27;s main railway station is Napoli Centrale, which is located in Piazza Garibaldi; other significant stations include the Napoli Campi Flegrei and Napoli Mergellina. Napoli Afragola serves high-speed trains that do not start or finish at Napoli Centrale railway station. Naples&#x27; streets are famously narrow (it was the first city in the world to set up a pedestrian one-way street), so the general public commonly use compact hatchback cars and scooters for personal transit. Since 2007, trains running at have connected Naples with Rome with a journey time of under an hour, and direct high speed services also operate to Florence, Bologna, Milan, Turin and Salerno. Direct sleeper &#x27;boat train&#x27; services operate nightly to cities in Sicily.

The port of Naples runs several ferry, hydrofoil, and SWATH catamaran lines to Capri, Ischia and Sorrento, Salerno, Positano and Amalfi. Services are also available to Sicily, Sardinia, Ponza and the Aeolian Islands. The port serves over 6 million local passengers annually, plus a further 1 million international cruise ship passengers. A regional hydrofoil transport service, the &quot;Metropolitana del Mare&quot;, runs annually from July to September, maintained by a consortium of shipowners and local administrations.

The Naples International Airport is located in the suburb of San Pietro a Patierno. It is the largest airport in southern Italy, with around 250 national and international flights arriving or departing daily.

The average commute with public transit in Naples on a weekday is 77 minutes. Nineteen per cent of public transit commuters ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 27 minutes, while 56% of riders wait for over 20 minutes. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 11% travel for over in a single direction.

===Urban public transport===
Naples has an extensive public transport network, including trams, buses and trolleybuses, most of which are operated by the municipally owned company Azienda Napoletana Mobilità (ANM). Some suburban services are operated by AIR Campania.

The city furthermore operates the Naples Metro (), an underground rapid transit railway system which integrates both surface railway lines and the city&#x27;s metro stations, many of which are noted for their decorative architecture and public art. In fact, the station of Via Toledo is often in the top spots of the rankings of the most beautiful metro stations in the world.

There are also four funiculars in the city (operated by ANM): &quot;Centrale&quot;, &quot;Chiaia&quot;, &quot;Montesanto&quot; and &quot;Mergellina&quot;. Four public elevators are in operation in the city: within the bridge of Chiaia, in via Acton, near the Sanità Bridge, and in the Ventaglieri Park, accompanied by two public escalators.

== Culture ==
=== Art ===

Naples has long been a centre of art and architecture, dotted with Medieval-, Baroque- and Renaissance-era churches, castles and palaces. A critical factor in the development of the Neapolitan school of painting was Caravaggio&#x27;s arrival in Naples in 1606. In the 18th century, Naples went through a period of neoclassicism, following the discovery of the remarkably intact Roman ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii.

The Neapolitan Academy of Fine Arts, founded by Charles III of Bourbon in 1752 as the Real Accademia di Disegno (en: &quot;Royal Academy of Design&quot;), was the centre of the artistic School of Posillipo in the 19th century. Artists such as Domenico Morelli, Giacomo Di Chirico, Francesco Saverio Altamura and Gioacchino Toma worked in Naples during this period, and many of their works are now exhibited in the academy&#x27;s art collection. The modern Academy offers courses in painting, decorating, sculpture, design, restoration, and urban planning. Naples is also known for its theatres, which are among the oldest in Europe: the Teatro di San Carlo opera house dates back to the 18th century.

Naples is also the home of the artistic tradition of Capodimonte porcelain. In 1743, Charles of Bourbon founded the Royal Factory of Capodimonte, many of whose artworks are now on display in the Museum of Capodimonte. Several of Naples&#x27; mid-19th-century porcelain factories remain active today.

=== Cuisine ===


Naples is internationally famous for its cuisine and wine; it draws culinary influences from the numerous cultures which have inhabited it throughout its history, including the Greeks, Spanish and French. Neapolitan cuisine emerged as a distinct form in the 18th century. The ingredients are typically rich in taste while remaining affordable to the general populace.

Naples is traditionally credited as the home of pizza. This originated as a meal of the poor, but under Ferdinand IV it became popular among the upper classes: famously, the Margherita pizza was named after Queen Margherita of Savoy after her visit to the city. Cooked traditionally in a wood-burning oven, the ingredients of Neapolitan pizza have been strictly regulated by law since 2004, and must include wheat flour type &quot;00&quot; with the addition of flour type &quot;0&quot; yeast, natural mineral water, peeled tomatoes or fresh cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, sea salt and extra virgin olive oil.

Spaghetti is also associated with the city, and is commonly eaten with clams &quot;vongole&quot; or &quot;lupini di mare&quot;. A popular Neapolitan folkloric symbol is the comic figure Pulcinella eating a plate of spaghetti. Other dishes popular in Naples include &quot;Parmigiana di melanzane&quot;, &quot;spaghetti alle vongole&quot; and &quot;casatiello&quot;. As a coastal city, Naples is furthermore known for numerous seafood dishes, including &quot;impepata di cozze&quot; (peppered mussels), &quot;purpetiello affogato&quot; (octopus poached in broth), &quot;alici marinate&quot; (marinated anchovies), &quot;baccalà alla napoletana&quot; (salt cod) and &quot;baccalà fritto&quot; (fried cod), a dish commonly eaten during the Christmas period.

Naples is well known for its sweet dishes, including colourful , which is similar to ice cream, though more fruit-based. Popular Neapolitan pastry dishes include , , and , the latter of which is prepared specially for Easter celebrations. Another seasonal sweet is &quot;struffoli&quot;, a sweet-tasting honey dough decorated and eaten around Christmas. Neapolitan coffee is also widely acclaimed. The traditional Neapolitan flip coffee pot, known as the &quot;cuccuma&quot; or &quot;cuccumella&quot;, was the basis for the invention of the espresso machine, and also inspired the Moka pot.

Wineries in the Vesuvius area produce wines such as the &quot;Lacryma Christi&quot; (&quot;tears of Christ&quot;) and &quot;Terzigno&quot;. Naples is also the home of &quot;limoncello&quot;, a popular lemon liqueur.

In May 2024, Time Out has named Naples the best city for food.

=== Festivals ===
The cultural significance of Naples is often represented through a series of festivals held in the city. The following is a list of several festivals that take place in Naples (note: some festivals are not held on an annual basis).
* &quot;Festa di Piedigrotta&quot; (&quot;Piedigrotta Festival&quot;) – A musical event typically held in September in memory of the famous Madonna of Piedigrotta. Throughout the month, a series of musical workshops, concerts, religious events and children&#x27;s events are held to entertain the citizens of Naples and surrounding areas.
* &quot;Pizzafest&quot; – As Naples is famous for being home to pizza, the city hosts an eleven-day festival dedicated to this iconic dish. This is a key event for Neapolitans and tourists alike, as various stations are open for tasting a wide range of true Neapolitan pizza. In addition to pizza tasting, a variety of entertainment shows are displayed.
* &quot;Maggio dei Monumenti&quot; (&quot;May of Monuments&quot;) – A cultural event where the city hosts a variety of special events dedicated to the birth of King Charles of Bourbon. It festival features art and music of the 18th century, and many buildings which may normally be closed throughout the year are opened for visitors to view.
* &quot;Il Ritorno della festa di San Gennaro&quot; (&quot;The Return of the Feast of San Gennaro&quot;) – An annual celebration and feast of faith held over three days, commemorating Saint Gennaro. Throughout the festival, parades, religious processions and musical entertainment are featured. An annual celebration is also held in &quot;Little Italy&quot; in Manhattan.

=== Language ===

The Neapolitan language, considered to be a distinct language and mainly spoken in the city, is also found in the region of Campania and has been diffused into other areas of Southern Italy by Neapolitan migrants, and in many different places in the world. On 14 October 2008, a regional law was enacted by Campania which has the effect that the use of the Neapolitan language is protected.

The term &quot;Neapolitan language&quot; is often used to describe the language of all of Campania (except Cilento), and is sometimes applied to the entire South Italian language; &quot;Ethnologue&quot; refers to the latter as &quot;Napoletano-Calabrese&quot;. This linguistic group is spoken throughout most of southern continental Italy, including the Gaeta and Sora district of southern Lazio, the southern part of Marche and Abruzzo, Molise, Basilicata, northern Calabria, and northern and central Apulia. In 1976, there were an estimated 7,047,399 native speakers of this group of dialects.

=== Literature and philosophy ===

Naples is one of the leading centres of Italian literature. The history of the Neapolitan language was deeply entwined with that of the Tuscan dialect, which then became the current Italian language. The first written testimonies of the Italian language are the Placiti Cassinensi legal documents, dated 960 A.D., preserved in the Monte Cassino Abbey, which are, in fact, evidence of a language spoken in a southern dialect. The Tuscan poet Boccaccio lived for many years at the court of King Robert the Wise and his successor Joanna of Naples, using Naples as a setting for a number of his later novels. His works contain some words that are taken from Neapolitan instead of the corresponding Italian, e.g. &quot;&quot;testo&quot; (neap.: &quot;testa&quot;&quot;), which in Naples indicates a large terracotta jar used to cultivate shrubs and little trees. King Alfonso V of Aragon stated in 1442 that the Neapolitan language was to be used instead of Latin in official documents.
Later Neapolitan was replaced by Italian in the first half of the 16th century, during Spanish domination. In 1458 the &quot;Accademia Pontaniana&quot;, one of the first academies in Italy, was established in Naples as a free initiative by men of letters, science and literature. In 1480 the writer and poet Jacopo Sannazzaro wrote the first pastoral romance, &quot;Arcadia&quot;, which influenced Italian literature. In 1634 Giambattista Basile collected &quot;Lo Cunto de li Cunti&quot; five books of ancient tales written in the Neapolitan dialect rather than Italian. Philosopher Giordano Bruno, who theorised the existence of infinite solar systems and the infinity of the entire universe, completed his studies at the University of Naples. Due to philosophers such as Giambattista Vico, Naples became one of the centres of the Italian peninsula for historical and philosophy of history studies.

Jurisprudence studies were enhanced in Naples thanks to eminent personalities of jurists like Bernardo Tanucci, Gaetano Filangieri and Antonio Genovesi. In the 18th century Naples, together with Milan, became one of the most important sites from which the Enlightenment penetrated Italy. Poet and philosopher Giacomo Leopardi visited the city in 1837 and died there. His works influenced Francesco de Sanctis, who studied in Naples and eventually became Minister of Instruction during the Italian kingdom. De Sanctis was one of the first literary critics to discover, study and diffuse the poems and literary works of the great poet from Recanati.

Writer and journalist Matilde Serao co-founded the newspaper Il Mattino with her husband Edoardo Scarfoglio in 1892. Serao was an acclaimed novelist and writer during her day. Poet Salvatore Di Giacomo was one of the most famous writers in the Neapolitan dialect, and many of his poems were adapted to music, becoming famous Neapolitan songs. In the 20th century, philosophers like Benedetto Croce pursued the long tradition of philosophy studies in Naples, and personalities like jurists and lawyer Enrico De Nicola pursued legal and constitutional studies. De Nicola later helped to draft the modern Constitution of the Italian Republic and was eventually elected to the office of President of the Italian Republic. Other noted Neapolitan writers and journalists include Antonio De Curtis, Giancarlo Siani, Roberto Saviano and Elena Ferrante. In Naples&#x27;44, An Intelligence Officer in the Italian Labyrinth (London, Eland, 2002), the acclaimed British travel writer Norman Lewis records the lives of the Napolitean people following the liberation of the city from Nazi forces in 1943.

=== Theatre ===
Naples was one of the centres of the peninsula from which originated the modern theatre genre as nowadays intended, evolving from 16th century . The masked character of Pulcinella is a worldwide famous figure either as a theatrical character or puppetry character.

The music Opera genre of was created in Naples in the 18th century and then spread to Rome and northern Italy. In the period of Belle Époque, Naples rivalled Paris for its , and many famous Neapolitan songs were originally created to entertain the public in the cafès of Naples. Perhaps the most well-known song is &quot;Ninì Tirabusciò&quot;. The history of how this song was born was dramatised in the eponymous comedy movie &quot;Ninì Tirabusciò: la donna che inventò la mossa&quot; starring Monica Vitti.

The Neapolitan popular genre of is an important genre of modern folk theatre worldwide, dramatising common canon themes of thwarted love stories, comedies, tearjerker stories, commonly about honest people becoming camorra outlaws due to unfortunate events. The Sceneggiata became very popular amongst Neapolitans and eventually one of the best-known genres of Italian cinematography thanks to actors and singers like Mario Merola and Nino D&#x27;Angelo. Many writers and playwrights, such as Raffaele Viviani, wrote comedies and dramas for this genre. Actors and comedians like Eduardo Scarpetta and then his sons Eduardo De Filippo, Peppino De Filippo and Titina De Filippo contributed to making the Neapolitan theatre. Its comedies and tragedies, such as &quot;Filumena Marturano&quot; and &quot;Napoli Milionaria&quot;, are well-known.

=== Music ===
Naples has played an important role in the history of Western European art music for more than four centuries. The first music conservatories were established in the city under Spanish rule in the 16th century. The San Pietro a Majella music conservatory, founded in 1826 by Francesco I of Bourbon, continues to operate today as both a prestigious centre of musical education and a musical museum.

During the late Baroque period, Alessandro Scarlatti, the father of Domenico Scarlatti, established the Neapolitan school of opera; this was in the form of &quot;opera seria&quot;, which was a new development for its time. Another form of opera originating in Naples is &quot;opera buffa&quot;, a style of comic opera strongly linked to Battista Pergolesi and Piccinni; later contributors to the genre included Rossini and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The Teatro di San Carlo, built in 1737, is the oldest working theatre in Europe, and remains the operatic centre of Naples.
The earliest six-string guitar was created by the Neapolitan Gaetano Vinaccia in 1779; the instrument is now referred to as the romantic guitar. The Vinaccia family also developed the mandolin. Influenced by the Spanish, Neapolitans became pioneers of classical guitar music, with Ferdinando Carulli and Mauro Giuliani being prominent exponents. Giuliani, who was actually from Apulia but lived and worked in Naples, is widely considered to be one of the greatest guitar players and composers of the 19th century, along with his Catalan contemporary Fernando Sor. Another Neapolitan musician of note was opera singer Enrico Caruso, one of the most prominent opera tenors of all time: he was considered a man of the people in Naples, hailing from a working-class background.

A popular traditional dance in Southern Italy and Naples is the Tarantella, which originated in Apulia and spread throughout the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The Neapolitan tarantella is a courtship dance performed by couples whose &quot;rhythms, melodies, gestures, and accompanying songs are quite distinct&quot;, featuring faster, more cheerful music.

A notable element of popular Neapolitan music is the style, essentially the traditional music of the city, with a repertoire of hundreds of folk songs, some of which can be traced back to the 13th century. The genre became a formal institution in 1835, after the introduction of the annual Festival of Piedigrotta songwriting competition. Some of the best-known recording artists in this field include Roberto Murolo, Sergio Bruni and Renato Carosone. There are furthermore various forms of music popular in Naples but not well known outside it, such as &quot;cantautore&quot; (&quot;singer-songwriter&quot;) and &quot;sceneggiata&quot;, which has been described as a musical soap opera; the most well-known exponent of this style is Mario Merola.

=== Cinema and television ===

Naples has had a significant influence on Italian cinema. Because of the city&#x27;s relevance, many films and television shows are set (entirely or partially) in Naples. In addition to serving as the backdrop for several movies and shows, many talented celebrities (actors, actresses, directors, and producers) are originally from Naples.

Naples was the location for several early Italian cinema masterpieces. &quot;Assunta Spina&quot; (1915) was a silent film adapted from a theatrical drama by Neapolitan writer Salvatore Di Giacomo. The film was directed by Neapolitan Gustavo Serena. Serena also starred in the 1912 film &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

A list of some well-known films that take place (fully or partially) in Naples includes:
* &quot;Shoeshine&quot; (1946), directed by Neapolitan, Vittorio De Sica
* &quot;Hands over the City&quot; (1963), directed by Neapolitan, Francesco Rosi

Naples is home to one of the first Italian colour films, &quot;Toto in Color&quot; (1952), starring Totò (Antonio de Curtis), a famous comedic actor born in Naples.

Some notable comedies set in Naples include (&quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot;), by Vittorio De Sica, starring Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, &quot;Adelina of Naples&quot; (Academy Award-winning movie), &quot;It Started in Naples&quot;, again by Vittorio De Sica, dramatic movies like Dino Risi&#x27;s &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, war movies like &quot;The Four Days of Naples&quot; by Sardinian director Nanni Loy, music and Sceneggiata movies like &quot;Zappatore&quot;, from the eponymous song by Libero Bovio, starring singer and actor Mario Merola, crime movies like with Ben Gazzara playing the part of infamous camorra boss Raffaele Cutolo, and historical or costume movies like &quot;That Hamilton Woman&quot; starring Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier.

More modern Neapolitan films include , which depicts the misadventures of a young emigrant in the late 20th century. The 2008 film &quot;Gomorrah&quot;, based on the book by Roberto Saviano, explores the dark underbelly of the city of Naples through five intertwining stories about the powerful Neapolitan crime syndicate, as well as the TV series of the same name.

Several episodes of the animated series &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; also have references/influences from Naples. The song &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; played by Tom Cat in &quot;Cat and Dupli-cat&quot; has its origins in Naples. &quot;Neapolitan Mouse&quot; takes place in the same city.

The Japanese series &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;″s part 5, Vento Aureo, takes place in the city.

Naples has appeared in episodes of TV serials such as &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and the 1998 version of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, starring Gérard Depardieu.

== Sport ==
Football is by far the most popular sport in Naples. Brought to the city by the British during the early 20th century, the sport is deeply embedded in local culture: it is popular at every level of society, from the &quot;scugnizzi&quot; (street children) to wealthy professionals. The city&#x27;s best known football club is Napoli, which plays its home games at the Stadio Maradona in Fuorigrotta. The club&#x27;s stadium was renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona in honour of the Argentinian attacking midfielder who played for the club for seven years. The team plays in Serie A and has won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; three times, the Coppa Italia six times and the Supercoppa Italiana twice. The team has also won the UEFA Cup, and once named FIFA Player of the Century Diego Maradona among its players. Naples is the birthplace of numerous prominent professional footballers, including Ciro Ferrara and Fabio Cannavaro. Cannavaro was captain of Italy&#x27;s national team until 2010 and led the team to victory in the 2006 World Cup. He was consequently named World Player of the Year.

Some of the city&#x27;s smaller clubs include Sporting Neapolis and Internapoli, which play at the Stadio Arturo Collana. The city also has teams in a variety of other sports: Eldo Napoli represents the city in basketball&#x27;s Serie A and plays in the city of Bagnoli. The city co-hosted the EuroBasket 1969. Partenope Rugby is the city&#x27;s best-known rugby union side: the team has won the rugby union Serie A twice. Other popular local sports include futsal, water polo, horse racing, sailing, fencing, boxing and martial arts. The Accademia Nazionale di Scherma (National Academy and Fencing School of Naples) is the only place in Italy where the titles &quot;Master of Sword&quot; and &quot;Master of Kendo&quot; can be obtained.

=== Tailoring ===
Neapolitan tailoring was born as an attempt to loosen up the stiffness of English tailoring, which did not suit the Neapolitan lifestyle. The Neapolitan jacket is shorter, lighter, quarter-lined or unlined, and has no shoulder padding.

<doc id="55884" wikidata="Q1024" url="?curid=55884" title="Triglav">
<text>Triglav (; ; ), with an elevation of , is the highest mountain in Slovenia and the highest peak of the Julian Alps. The mountain is the pre-eminent symbol of the Slovene nation, appearing on the coat of arms and flag of Slovenia. It is the centrepiece of Triglav National Park, Slovenia&#x27;s only national park. Triglav was also the highest peak in Yugoslavia before Slovenia&#x27;s independence in 1991.

==Name==
Various names have been used for the mountain through history. An old map from 1567 used the Latin name &quot;Ocra mons&quot;, whereas Johann Weikhard von Valvasor called it &quot;Krma&quot; (the modern name of an Alpine valley in the vicinity) in the second half of the 17th century. According to the German mountaineer and professor Adolf Gstirner, the name &quot;Triglav&quot; first appeared in written sources as &quot;Terglau&quot; in 1452, but the original source has been lost. The next known occurrence of &quot;Terglau&quot; is cited by Gstirner and is from a court description of the border in 1573. Early forms of the name &quot;Triglav&quot; also include &quot;Terglau&quot; in 1612, &quot;Terglou&quot; in 1664 and &quot;Terklou&quot; around 1778–1789. The name is derived from the compound &quot;*Tri-golvъ&quot; (literally &#x27;three-head&#x27;—that is, &#x27;three peaks&#x27;), which may be understood literally because the mountain has three peaks when viewed from much of Upper Carniola. It is unlikely that the name has any connection to the Slavic deity Triglav. In the local dialect, the name is pronounced (with a second-syllable accent, as if it was written &quot;Trglov&quot;, with the dark L experiencing vocalization) in contrast to standard Slovene &quot;Tríglav&quot;. The highest peak is sometimes also called Big Mount Triglav () to distinguish it from Little Mount Triglav (, ) immediately to the east.

==History==
The first recorded ascent of Triglav was achieved in 1778, at the initiative of the industrialist and polymath Sigmund Zois. According to the most commonly cited report, published in the newspaper &quot;Illyrisches Blatt&quot; in 1821 by the historian and geographer Johann Richter, these were the surgeon Lovrenz Willomitzer (written as &quot;Willonitzer&quot; by Richter), the chamois hunter Štefan Rožič, and the miners Luka Korošec and Matevž Kos. According to a report by Belsazar Hacquet in his &quot;Oryctographia Carniolica&quot;, the ascent took place towards the end of 1778, by two chamois hunters, one of them being Luka Korošec, and one of his former students, whose name is not mentioned.

Triglav&#x27;s height was first measured on 23 September 1808 by Valentin Stanič. The first to put the name of the mountain on a map, written as &quot;Mons Terglou&quot;, was Joannes Disma Floriantschitsch de Grienfeld, who in 1744 published the map &quot;Ducatus Carniolae Tabula Chorographica&quot;. The first map its name appeared on written as &quot;Triglav&quot; was &quot;Zemljovid Slovenske dežele in pokrajin&quot; (Map of the Slovene Land and Provinces) by Peter Kosler, completed from 1848 until 1852 and published in Vienna in 1861.

During World War II, Triglav symbolically captured the primary drive by the Slovene resistance to the Fascist and Nazi armies. The Slovene Partisans wore the Triglav cap from 1942 until after 1944.

Triglav was the highest peak of the now defunct Yugoslavia; it was both countries&#x27; highest and most prominent peak. The expression &quot;from Triglav to the Vardar&quot; (a river in southern Macedonia) was a common synecdoche for Yugoslavia, referring to two prominent features at the geographic extremes of the nation.

==Landmarks==

===Aljaž Tower===
At the top of the mountain stands a small metal structure, the Aljaž Tower (). It acts as a storm shelter and a triangulation point. Along with Triglav, it is also a landmark of Slovenia and a symbol of the Slovenes and Slovene territorial sovereignty.

The tower&#x27;s namesake was the priest, mountaineer and patriot Jakob Aljaž. In early 1895, he drew up, with a piece of chalk on the floor of his room in the parish of Dovje, plans for a cylindrical tower with a flag on its top. In April that year he purchased the summit of Triglav for the sum of one florin. Having done so, he secured himself the right to erect a building on the mountain top. The tower was constructed from iron and zinc coated sheet steel by Anton Belec from Šent Vid nad Ljubljano. He and four workers brought the parts of the tower to the summit of Triglav and put the tower together in only five hours on 7 August 1895. The opening took place that same day. Aljaž donated the shelter to the Slovene Alpine Society today Alpine Association of Slovenia.

In the beginning, there were three four-legged chairs, a summit register, a spirit stove, and the image &quot;Triglav Panorama&quot; by Marko Pernhart in the tower. It was later repainted and renovated several times by Alojz Knafelc and others. In the Communist era, as the highest point of the former Yugoslavia, it was painted red and decorated with a red star. However, it has now more or less been restored to its original appearance. The star was removed shortly before the dissolution of Yugoslavia. On the proclamation of Slovene independence in June 1991, the flag of Slovenia was raised on top of the tower.
===Stanič Shelter===
In 1895, due to a lack of space, Aljaž also commissioned the building of the Stanič Shelter. It is located below the top of Triglav and is named after the poet and mountaineer Valentin Stanič. The shelter has dimensions of and has room for 8 people sitting or 16 standing. Originally it also had a wooden door, benches, a table, and a chair. Its significance diminished after the Kredarica Lodge was erected in 1896.

===Triglav Glacier===

The Triglav Glacier () was located below the summit on the karstified Triglav Plateaus (), part of the northeastern side of the mountain. Covering over at the end of the 19th century, the glacier had shrunk to by 1946, and after further shrinkage had fallen into two parts by 1992. By 2011 it covered an area of only 1–3 hectares, depending on the season. It was no longer considered a glacier in 2019.

==Cultural significance==

===Folk literature===
The Triglav area is the setting of an old Slovene folk tale concerning a hunter seeking a treasure guarded by an enchanted chamois buck named &quot;Zlatorog&quot; (, after its golden horns).

===Arts===

The earliest known depiction of Triglav is on the front page of the work &quot;Oryctographia Carniolica&quot;, written by Belsazar Hacquet. It was a copper engraving made in 1778 by C. Conti after a drawing by Franz Xaver Baraga. Among later visual artists who depicted Triglav, the most well known are Anton Karinger (1829–1870) from Ljubljana, Marko Pernhart (1824–1871) from Klagenfurt, Valentin Hodnik (1896–1935) from Stara Fužina, Edo Deržaj (1904–1980) from Ljubljana, and more recently Marjan Zaletel (born 1945), living in Ljubljana.

Among the musical works related to Triglav, a special place is held for the poem &quot;Oh, Triglav, My Home&quot; (). It was written in 1894 by the priest and poet Matija Zemljič and quickly became very popular among Slovene mountaineers. In 2007, its first stanza, accompanied by a melody of Jakob Aljaž, became the official anthem of the Alpine Association of Slovenia. An instrumental version of the poem, written by Bojan Adamič, is part of the start and end credits of the annual ski jumping broadcasts from Planica. In 2023, the Slovenian industrial act Laibach released their rendition of the song, titled &quot;O, Triglav, moj dom.&quot;

The first Slovene-language full-length film, recorded in 1931 by Janko Ravnik, was titled &quot;In the Kingdom of the Goldhorn&quot; () and features an ascent by a group of students to the top of Triglav. The second Slovene full-length film, recorded the following year, was titled &quot;The Slopes of Mount Triglav&quot; (). It was directed by Ferdo Delak and was a romantic story featuring a wedding on the top of Triglav.

Since 1968, Triglav has become a theme of avant-garde artists. The first instance was a manifestation by the art group OHO, called &quot;Mount Triglav&quot;, which took place in December 1968 at Ljubljana&#x27;s Congress Square. In 2004, the group IRWIN produced a series of paintings named &quot;Like to Like/ Mount Triglav&quot;. In 2007, an artistic performance was held atop Mount Triglav by the artists Janez Janša (director), Janez Janša (visual artist) and Janez Janša (performance artist) called &quot;Mount Triglav on Mount Triglav&quot;.

===National symbol===

A stylized depiction of Triglav&#x27;s distinctive shape is the central element of the Slovene coat of arms, designed by the sculptor Marko Pogačnik, and is in turn featured on the flag of Slovenia. Alongside San Marino and Slovakia, Slovenia is the only other country in Europe and one of the few in the world to feature a mountain on its coat of arms. Formerly, it was featured on the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia.

The first to depict Triglav as the symbol of the Slovenes was the architect Jože Plečnik, who in 1934 put it besides other coats-of-arms of the nations of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on the coat of the statue of the Mother of God in front of the parish church in Bled.

During World War II, the stylised Triglav was the symbol of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation resistance movement. The distinctive three-pronged caps worn by Slovene Partisans during World War II were known as &quot;triglavkas&quot;.

A relief map of the mountain is the design on the national side of the Slovene 50 eurocent coin.

The former Slovene president Milan Kučan once proclaimed that it is a duty of every Slovenian person to climb Triglav at least once in their lifetime.

<text>In economics, a local currency is a currency that can be spent in a particular geographical locality at participating organisations. A regional currency is a form of local currency encompassing a larger geographical area, while a community currency might be local or be used for exchange within an online community. A local currency acts as a complementary currency to a national currency, rather than replacing it, and aims to encourage spending within a local community, especially with locally owned businesses. Such currencies may not be backed by a national government nor be legal tender. About 300 complementary currencies, including local currencies, are listed in the Complementary Currency Resource Center worldwide database.

==Terminology==
Some definitions:

* Complementary currency - is used as a complement to a national currency, as a medium of exchange, which is usually not legal tender.
* Community currency - a complementary currency used by a group with a common bond, such as residents of a locality, association, or members of a business or online community.
* Local currency - a complementary currency used in a locality.
* Regional currency - a local currency where the locality is a larger region.
* Auxiliary currency, microcurrency, Eco-Money - less common synonyms for community or local currency. (see for example Douthwaite &amp; Wagman 1999)
* Private currency - a currency issued by an individual, business or non-governmental organization. Complementary currencies are a type of private currency.
* Sectoral currency - a complementary currency used within one economic sector, such as education or health care.
* Alternative currency - generally, a synonym for complementary currency, referring to a currency designed to work in conjunction with the national currency; less often refers to a type of private currency which attempts to supplant or circumvent the national currency.

==Purpose==
Local currencies aim at using money as a tool to achieve social or environmental objectives. According to the New Economics Foundation partner Community Currencies in Action: 
Some of the purposes for community currencies identified by Community Currencies in Action include:

* Democratizing services and organisations: time credits for volunteering encourage people to actively engage in their community while making services, such as elderly care, more democratic. Zeitvorsoge, Makkie
* Supporting small and medium enterprises: Community currencies can serve as a means to promote independent shops over large corporations since they keep on circulating locally. They can also help SMEs support each other financially by lending and receiving credit, goods and services within the currency network. Examples are: Bristol Pound, SoNantes, TradeQoin, Chiemgauer
* Countering inequality and social exclusion: Specially designed currencies can address inequality issues by giving everyone the chance to get involved in their community; for instance by rewarding participation in voluntary programs. (Spice Time Credits, Makkie)
* Addressing environmental impacts: Community currencies can play a role in better valuation of environmental resources and providing an incentive for more sustainable behavior. For example, the Belgian Portemonnee rewards residents for environmentally positive actions such as composting. Reward currencies can also encourage businesses to adopt more environmentally sound practices.
* Maintaining the purchasing power, value preservation. Example: Convertible Minute / Minutes Bank

==Benefits==
The Wörgl experiment illustrates some of the common characteristics and major benefits of local currencies.

# Local currencies with negative interest rate or demurrage tend to circulate much more rapidly than national currencies. The same amount of currency in circulation is employed more times and results in far greater overall economic activity. It produces greater benefit per unit. The higher velocity of money is a result of the negative interest rate which encourages people to spend the money more quickly.
# Local currencies enable the community to more fully use its existing productive resources, especially unemployed labor, which has a catalytic effect on the rest of the local economy. They are based on the premise that the community is not fully using its productive capacities, because of a lack of local purchasing power. The alternative currency is used to increase demand, resulting in a greater exploitation of productive resources. So long as the local economy is functioning at less than full capacity, the introduction of local currency need not be inflationary, even when it results in a significant increase in total money supply and total economic activity.
# Since local currencies are only accepted within the community, their usage encourages the purchase of locally produced and locally-available goods and services. Thus, for any level of economic activity, more of the benefit accrues to the local community and less drains out to other parts of the country or the world. For instance, construction work undertaken with local currencies employs local labor and uses as far as possible local materials. The enhanced local effect becomes an incentive for the local population to accept and use the scrips.
# Some forms of complementary currency can promote fuller use of resources over a much wider geographic area and help bridge the barriers imposed by distance. The Fureai kippu system in Japan issues credits in exchange for assistance to senior citizens. Family members living far from their parents can earn credits by offering assistance to the elderly in their local community. The credits can then be transferred to their parents and redeemed by them for local assistance. Airline frequent flyer miles are a form of complementary currency that promotes customer-loyalty in exchange for free travel. The airlines offer most of the coupons for seats on less heavily sold flights where some seats normally go empty, thus providing a benefit to customers at relatively low cost to the airline.
# While most of these currencies are restricted to a small geographic area or a country, through the Internet electronic forms of complementary currency can be used to stimulate transactions on a global basis. In China, Tencent&#x27;s QQ coins are a virtual form of currency that has gained wide circulation. QQ coins can be bought for Renminbi and used to buy virtual products and services such as ringtones and on-line video game time. They can also be obtained through on-line exchange for goods and services at about twice the Renminbi price, by which additional &#x27;money&#x27; is being directly created. Though virtual currencies are not &#x27;local&#x27; in the traditional sense, they do cater to the specific needs of a particular community, a virtual community. Once in circulation, they add to the total effective purchasing power of the on-line population as in the case of local currencies. The Chinese government has begun to tax the coins as they are exchanged from virtual currency to actual hard currency.

==Difficulties and criticisms==

Local currencies and the Transition Towns movement in the UK have been criticized for failing to address the needs of the wider population, especially lower socio-economic groups. Such local currency initiatives have been more widely criticized as having limited success in stimulating spending in local economies, and as an unrealistic strategy to reduce carbon emissions.

== Modern local currencies ==
Modern local currencies can be classified into the following distinct types:

# Transition currency based on the local currencies used by the Transition Towns movement in the UK. They include Brixton Pound and Bristol Pound in the UK, BerkShares in the USA, and Salt Spring Dollars in Canada. Transition currencies are payment voucher-based systems that are exchangeable with the national currency. Between 2002-2014 many experiments in local currency took this form. Such currencies aim to raise the resilience of local economies by encouraging re-localisation of buying and food production. The drive for this change has arisen from a range of community-based initiatives and social movements. The Transition Towns movement originating in the UK has used local currencies for re-localisation in the face of energy descent from peak oil and climate change. Other drives include movements against clone town and big-box trends.
# Rewards currency based on the frequent flyer model. Consumer spends cash with participating businesses who issue rewards points in a local currency. These rewards points can be used to offset cash prices in future purchases. An example is Oakland Grown in Oakland, CA.
# Mutual Credit currency based on the mutual credit system. This can be further sub-divided into two:
## Time-based currency also known as Time Banks that use time as a measure of value. An example is Dane County Time Bank.
## Trade exchanges and LETS (local exchange trading system) that use price as a measure of value. An example of local currency implemented as a trade exchange is Bay Bucks in the Bay Area of California, USA. LETS were originally started in Vancouver, Canada, there are presently more than 30 LETS systems operating in Canada and over 400 in the United Kingdom. Australia, France, New Zealand, and Switzerland have similar systems.

==Software==
Several software packages have been written supporting the management of community currencies. In 1998, Richard Kay, a senior lecturer at Birmingham City University, wrote a &quot;Multi-registry System&quot; specification for routing and processing community currency transactions using an approach designed to be decentralized, with no single point of control or failure, using the Domain Name System for server discovery.

<text>In the security engineering subspecialty of computer science, a trusted system is one that is relied upon to a specified extent to enforce a specified security policy. This is equivalent to saying that a trusted system is one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the system is trusted to enforce).

The word &quot;trust&quot; is critical, as it does not carry the meaning that might be expected in everyday usage. A trusted system is one that the user feels safe to use, and trusts to perform tasks without secretly executing harmful or unauthorized programs; trusted computing refers to whether programs can trust the platform to be unmodified from the expected, and whether or not those programs are innocent or malicious or whether they execute tasks that are undesired by the user.

A trusted system can also be seen as a level-based security system where protection is provided and handled according to different levels. This is commonly found in the military, where information is categorized as unclassified (U), confidential (C), secret (S), top secret (TS), and beyond. These also enforce the policies of no read-up and no write-down.

==Trusted systems in classified information==
A subset of trusted systems (&quot;Division B&quot; and &quot;Division A&quot;) implement mandatory access control (MAC) labels, and as such, it is often assumed that they can be used for processing classified information. However, this is generally untrue. There are four modes in which one can operate a multilevel secure system: multilevel, compartmented, dedicated, and system-high modes. The National Computer Security Center&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Book&quot; specifies that B3 and A1 systems can only be used for processing a strict subset of security labels, and only when operated according to a particularly strict configuration.

Central to the concept of U.S. Department of Defense-style trusted systems is the notion of a &quot;reference monitor&quot;, which is an entity that occupies the logical heart of the system and is responsible for all access control decisions. Ideally, the reference monitor is
*tamper-proof
*always invoked
* small enough to be subject to independent testing, the completeness of which can be assured.

According to the U.S. National Security Agency&#x27;s 1983 Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), or &quot;Orange Book&quot;, a set of &quot;evaluation classes&quot; were defined that described the features and assurances that the user could expect from a trusted system.

The dedication of significant system engineering toward minimizing the complexity (not &quot;size&quot;, as often cited) of the trusted computing base (TCB) is key to the provision of the highest levels of assurance (B3 and A1). This is defined as that combination of hardware, software, and firmware that is responsible for enforcing the system&#x27;s security policy. An inherent engineering conflict would appear to arise in higher-assurance systems in that, the smaller the TCB, the larger the set of hardware, software, and firmware that lies outside the TCB and is, therefore, untrusted. Although this may lead the more technically naive to sophists&#x27; arguments about the nature of trust, the argument confuses the issue of &quot;correctness&quot; with that of &quot;trustworthiness&quot;.

TCSEC has a precisely defined hierarchy of six evaluation classes; the highest of these, A1, is featurally identical to B3—differing only in documentation standards. In contrast, the more recently introduced Common Criteria (CC), which derive from a blend of technically mature standards from various NATO countries, provide a tenuous spectrum of seven &quot;evaluation classes&quot; that intermix features and assurances in a non-hierarchical manner, and lack the precision and mathematical stricture of the TCSEC. In particular, the CC tolerate very loose identification of the &quot;target of evaluation&quot; (TOE) and support – even encourage – an inter-mixture of security requirements culled from a variety of predefined &quot;protection profiles.&quot; While a case can be made that even the seemingly arbitrary components of the TCSEC contribute to a &quot;chain of evidence&quot; that a fielded system properly enforces its advertised security policy, not even the highest (E7) level of the CC can truly provide analogous consistency and stricture of evidentiary reasoning.

The mathematical notions of trusted systems for the protection of classified information derive from two independent but interrelated corpora of work. In 1974, David Bell and Leonard LaPadula of MITRE, under the technical guidance and financial sponsorship of Maj. Roger Schell, Ph.D., of the U.S. Army Electronic Systems Command (Fort Hanscom, MA), devised the Bell–LaPadula model, in which a trustworthy computer system is modeled in terms of objects (passive repositories or destinations for data such as files, disks, or printers) and subjects (active entities that cause information to flow among objects &quot;e.g.&quot; users, or system processes or threads operating on behalf of users). The entire operation of a computer system can indeed be regarded as a &quot;history&quot; (in the serializability-theoretic sense) of pieces of information flowing from object to object in response to subjects&#x27; requests for such flows. At the same time, Dorothy Denning at Purdue University was publishing her Ph.D. dissertation, which dealt with &quot;lattice-based information flows&quot; in computer systems. (A mathematical &quot;lattice&quot; is a partially ordered set, characterizable as a directed acyclic graph, in which the relationship between any two vertices either &quot;dominates&quot;, &quot;is dominated by,&quot; or neither.) She defined a generalized notion of &quot;labels&quot; that are attached to entities—corresponding more or less to the full security markings one encounters on classified military documents, &quot;e.g.&quot; TOP SECRET WNINTEL TK DUMBO. Bell and LaPadula integrated Denning&#x27;s concept into their landmark MITRE technical report—entitled, &quot;Secure Computer System: Unified Exposition and Multics Interpretation&quot;. They stated that labels attached to objects represent the sensitivity of data contained within the object, while those attached to subjects represent the trustworthiness of the user executing the subject. (However, there can be a subtle semantic difference between the sensitivity of the data within the object and the sensitivity of the object itself.) 

The concepts are unified with two properties, the &quot;simple security property&quot; (a subject can only read from an object that it &quot;dominates&quot; [&quot;is greater than&quot; is a close, albeit mathematically imprecise, interpretation]) and the &quot;confinement property,&quot; or &quot;*-property&quot; (a subject can only write to an object that dominates it). (These properties are loosely referred to as &quot;no read-up&quot; and &quot;no write-down,&quot; respectively.) Jointly enforced, these properties ensure that information cannot flow &quot;downhill&quot; to a repository where insufficiently trustworthy recipients may discover it. By extension, assuming that the labels assigned to subjects are truly representative of their trustworthiness, then the no read-up and no write-down rules rigidly enforced by the reference monitor are sufficient to constrain Trojan horses, one of the most general classes of attacks (&quot;sciz.&quot;, the popularly reported worms and viruses are specializations of the Trojan horse concept).

The Bell–LaPadula model technically only enforces &quot;confidentiality&quot; or &quot;secrecy&quot; controls, &quot;i.e.&quot; they address the problem of the sensitivity of objects and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately disclose it. The dual problem of &quot;integrity&quot; (i.e. the problem of accuracy, or even provenance of objects) and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately modify or destroy it, is addressed by mathematically affine models; the most important of which is named for its creator, K. J. Biba. Other integrity models include the Clark-Wilson model and Shockley and Schell&#x27;s program integrity model, &quot;The SeaView Model&quot;

An important feature of MACs, is that they are entirely beyond the control of any user. The TCB automatically attaches labels to any subjects executed on behalf of users and files they access or modify. In contrast, an additional class of controls, termed discretionary access controls(DACs), are under the direct control of system users. Familiar protection mechanisms such as permission bits (supported by UNIX since the late 1960s and – in a more flexible and powerful form – by Multics since earlier still) and access control list (ACLs) are familiar examples of DACs.

The behavior of a trusted system is often characterized in terms of a mathematical model. This may be rigorous depending upon applicable operational and administrative constraints. These take the form of a finite-state machine (FSM) with state criteria, state transition constraints (a set of &quot;operations&quot; that correspond to state transitions), and a descriptive top-level specification, DTLS (entails a user-perceptible interface such as an API, a set of system calls in UNIX or system exits in mainframes). Each element of the aforementioned engenders one or more model operations.

==Trusted systems in trusted computing==
The Trusted Computing Group creates specifications that are meant to address particular requirements of trusted systems, including attestation of configuration and safe storage of sensitive information.

==Trusted systems in policy analysis==
In the context of national or homeland security, law enforcement, or social control policy, trusted systems provide conditional prediction about the behavior of people or objects prior to authorizing access to system resources. For example, trusted systems include the use of &quot;security envelopes&quot; in national security and counterterrorism applications, &quot;trusted computing&quot; initiatives in technical systems security, and credit or identity scoring systems in financial and anti-fraud applications. In general, they include any system in which
* probabilistic threat or risk analysis is used to assess &quot;trust&quot; for decision-making before authorizing access or for allocating resources against likely threats (including their use in the design of systems constraints to control behavior within the system); or
* deviation analysis or systems surveillance is used to ensure that behavior within systems complies with expected or authorized parameters.

The widespread adoption of these authorization-based security strategies (where the default state is DEFAULT=DENY) for counterterrorism, anti-fraud, and other purposes is helping accelerate the ongoing transformation of modern societies from a notional Beccarian model of criminal justice based on accountability for deviant actions after they occur to a Foucauldian model based on authorization, preemption, and general social compliance through ubiquitous preventative surveillance and control through system constraints.

In this emergent model, &quot;security&quot; is not geared towards policing but to risk management through surveillance, information exchange, auditing, communication, and classification. These developments have led to general concerns about individual privacy and civil liberty, and to a broader philosophical debate about appropriate social governance methodologies.

==Trusted systems in information theory==
Trusted systems in the context of information theory are based on the following definition:
In information theory, information has nothing to do with knowledge or meaning; it is simply that which is transferred from source to destination, using a communication channel. If, before transmission, the information is available at the destination, then the transfer is zero. Information received by a party is that which the party does not expect—as measured by the uncertainty of the party as to what the message will be.

Likewise, trust as defined by Gerck, has nothing to do with friendship, acquaintances, employee-employer relationships, loyalty, betrayal and other overly-variable concepts. Trust is not taken in the purely subjective sense either, nor as a feeling or something purely personal or psychological—trust is understood as something potentially communicable. Further, this definition of trust is abstract, allowing different instances and observers in a trusted system to communicate based on a common idea of trust (otherwise communication would be isolated in domains), where all necessarily different subjective and intersubjective realizations of trust in each subsystem (man and machines) may coexist.

Taken together in the model of information theory, &quot;information is what you do not expect&quot; and &quot;trust is what you know&quot;. Linking both concepts, trust is seen as &quot;qualified reliance on received information&quot;. In terms of trusted systems, an assertion of trust cannot be based on the record itself, but on information from other information channels. The deepening of these questions leads to complex conceptions of trust, which have been thoroughly studied in the context of business relationships. It also leads to conceptions of information where the &quot;quality&quot; of information integrates trust or trustworthiness in the structure of the information itself and of the information system(s) in which it is conceived—higher quality in terms of particular definitions of accuracy and precision means higher trustworthiness.

An example of the calculus of trust is &quot;If I connect two trusted systems, are they more or less trusted when taken together?&quot;.

The IBM Federal Software Group has suggested that &quot;trust points&quot; provide the most useful definition of trust for application in an information technology environment, because it is related to other information theory concepts and provides a basis for measuring trust. In a network-centric enterprise services environment, such a notion of trust is considered to be requisite for achieving the desired collaborative, service-oriented architecture vision.

<text>Cocoa is Apple&#x27;s native object-oriented application programming interface (API) for its desktop operating system macOS.

Cocoa consists of the Foundation Kit, Application Kit, and Core Data frameworks, as included by the codice_1 header file, and the libraries and frameworks included by those, such as the C standard library and the Objective-C runtime.

Cocoa applications are typically developed using the development tools provided by Apple, specifically Xcode (formerly Project Builder) and Interface Builder (now part of Xcode), using the programming languages Objective-C or Swift. However, the Cocoa programming environment can be accessed using other tools. It is also possible to write Objective-C Cocoa programs in a simple text editor and build it manually with GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) or Clang from the command line or from a makefile.

For end users, Cocoa applications are those written using the Cocoa programming environment. Such applications usually have a familiar look and feel, since the Cocoa programming environment provides a lot of common UI elements (such as buttons, scroll bars, etc.), and automates many aspects of an application to comply with Apple&#x27;s human interface guidelines.

For iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS, APIs similar to Application Kit, named UIKit and WatchKit, are available; they include gesture recognition, animation, and a different set of graphical control elements that are designed to accommodate the specific platforms they target. Foundation Kit and Core Data are also available in those operating systems. It is used in applications for Apple devices such as the iPhone, the iPod Touch, the iPad, the Apple TV, and the Apple Watch.

==History==

Cocoa continues the lineage of several software frameworks (mainly the &quot;App Kit&quot; and &quot;Foundation Kit&quot;) from the NeXTSTEP and OpenStep programming environments developed by NeXT in the 1980s and 1990s. Apple acquired NeXT in December 1996, and subsequently went to work on the Rhapsody operating system that was to be the direct successor of OPENSTEP. It was to have had an emulation base for classic Mac OS applications, named &quot;Blue Box&quot;. The OpenStep base of libraries and binary support was termed &quot;Yellow Box&quot;. Rhapsody evolved into Mac OS X, and the Yellow Box became Cocoa. Thus, Cocoa classes begin with the letters &quot;NS&quot;, such as NSString or NSArray. These stand for the original proprietary term for the OpenStep framework, NeXTSTEP.

Much of the work that went into developing OpenStep was applied to developing Mac OS X, Cocoa being the most visible part. However, differences exist. For example, NeXTSTEP and OpenStep used Display PostScript for on-screen display of text and graphics, while Cocoa depends on Apple&#x27;s Quartz (which uses the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, but not its underlying technology). Cocoa also has a level of Internet support, including the NSURL and WebKit HTML classes, and others, while OpenStep had only rudimentary support for managed network connections via NSFileHandle classes and Berkeley sockets.

The API toolbox was originally called “Yellow Box” and was renamed to Cocoa - a name that had been already trademarked by Apple. Apple&#x27;s &quot;Cocoa&quot; trademark had originated as the name of a multimedia project design application for children. The name was intended to evoke &quot;Java for kids&quot;, as it ran embedded in web pages. The original &quot;Cocoa&quot; program was discontinued following the return of Steve Jobs to Apple. At the time, Java was a big focus area for the company, so “Cocoa” was used as the new name for “Yellow Box” because, in addition to the native Objective-C usage, it could also be accessed from Java via a bridging layer. Even though Apple discontinued support for the Cocoa Java bridge, the name continued and was even used for the Cocoa Touch API.

==Memory management==
One feature of the Cocoa environment is its facility for managing dynamically allocated memory. Foundation Kit&#x27;s NSObject class, from which most classes, both vendor and user, are derived, implements a reference counting scheme for memory management. Objects that derive from the NSObject root class respond to a codice_2 and a codice_3 message, and keep a retain count. A method titled codice_4 exists, but contrary to its name, will usually not return the exact retain count of an object. It is mainly used for system-level purposes. Invoking it manually is not recommended by Apple.

A newly allocated object created with codice_5 or codice_6 has a retain count of one. Sending that object a codice_2 message increments the retain count, while sending it a codice_3 message decrements the retain count. When an object&#x27;s retain count reaches zero, it is deallocated by a procedure similar to a C++ &quot;destructor&quot;. codice_9 is not guaranteed to be invoked.

Starting with Objective-C 2.0, the Objective-C runtime implemented an optional garbage collector, which is now obsolete and deprecated in favor of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). In this model, the runtime turned Cocoa reference counting operations such as &quot;retain&quot; and &quot;release&quot; into no-ops. The garbage collector does not exist on the iOS implementation of Objective-C 2.0. Garbage collection in Objective-C ran on a low-priority background thread, and can halt on Cocoa&#x27;s user events, with the intention of keeping the user experience responsive. The legacy garbage collector is still available on Mac OS X version 10.13, but no Apple-provided applications use it.

In 2011, the LLVM compiler introduced Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), which replaces the conventional garbage collector by performing static analysis of Objective-C source code and inserting retain and release messages as necessary.

==Main frameworks==
Cocoa consists of three Objective-C object libraries called &quot;frameworks&quot;. Frameworks are functionally similar to shared libraries, a compiled object that can be dynamically loaded into a program&#x27;s address space at runtime, but frameworks add associated resources, header files, and documentation. The Cocoa frameworks are implemented as a type of bundle, containing the aforementioned items in standard locations.

* &quot;Foundation Kit&quot; (&quot;Foundation&quot;), first appeared in Enterprise Objects Framework on NeXTSTEP 3. It was developed as part of the OpenStep work, and subsequently became the basis for OpenStep&#x27;s AppKit when that system was released in 1994. On macOS, Foundation is based on Core Foundation. Foundation is a generic object-oriented library providing string and value manipulation, containers and iteration, distributed computing, event loops (run loops), and other functions that are not directly tied to the graphical user interface. The &quot;NS&quot; prefix, used for all classes and constants in the framework, comes from Cocoa&#x27;s OPENSTEP heritage, which was jointly developed by NeXT and Sun Microsystems.
* &quot;Application Kit&quot; (&quot;AppKit&quot;) is directly descended from the original NeXTSTEP Application Kit. It contains code programs can use to create and interact with graphical user interfaces. AppKit is built on top of Foundation, and uses the same &quot;NS&quot; prefix.
* &quot;Core Data&quot; is the object persistence framework included with Foundation and Cocoa and found in Cocoa.h.

A key part of the Cocoa architecture is its comprehensive views model. This is organized along conventional lines for an application framework, but is based on the Portable Document Format (PDF) drawing model provided by Quartz. This allows creating custom drawing content using PostScript-like drawing commands, which also allows automatic printer support and so forth. Since the Cocoa framework manages all the clipping, scrolling, scaling and other chores of drawing graphics, the programmer is freed from implementing basic infrastructure and can concentrate on the unique aspects of an application&#x27;s content.

==Model–view–controller==
The Smalltalk teams at Xerox PARC eventually settled on a design philosophy that led to easy development and high code reuse. Named &quot;model–view–controller&quot; (MVC), the concept breaks an application into three sets of interacting object classes:

* Model classes represent problem domain data and operations (such as lists of people/departments/budgets; documents containing sections/paragraphs/footnotes of stylized text).
* View classes implement visual representations and affordances for human-computer interaction (such as scrollable grids of captioned icons and pop-up menus of possible operations).
* Controller classes contain logic that surfaces model data as view representations, maps affordance-initiated user actions to model operations, and maintains state to keep the two synchronized.

Cocoa&#x27;s design is a fairly, but not absolutely strict application of MVC principles. Under OpenStep, most of the classes provided were either high-level View classes (in AppKit) or one of a number of relatively low-level model classes like NSString. Compared to similar MVC systems, OpenStep lacked a strong model layer. No stock class represented a &quot;document,&quot; for instance. During the transition to Cocoa, the model layer was expanded greatly, introducing a number of pre-rolled classes to provide functionality common to desktop applications.

In Mac OS X 10.3, Apple introduced the NSController family of classes, which provide predefined behavior for the controller layer. These classes are considered part of the Cocoa Bindings system, which also makes extensive use of protocols such as Key-Value Observing and Key-Value Binding. The term &#x27;binding&#x27; refers to a relationship between two objects, often between a view and a controller. Bindings allow the developer to focus more on declarative relationships rather than orchestrating fine-grained behavior.

With the arrival of Mac OS X 10.4, Apple extended this foundation further by introducing the Core Data framework, which standardizes change tracking and persistence in the model layer. In effect, the framework greatly simplifies the process of making changes to application data, undoing changes when necessary, saving data to disk, and reading it back in.

In providing framework support for all three MVC domains, Apple&#x27;s goal is to reduce the amount of boilerplate or &quot;glue&quot; code that developers have to write, freeing up resources to spend time on application-specific features.

==Late binding==
In most object-oriented languages, calls to methods are represented physically by a pointer to the code in memory. This restricts the design of an application since specific &quot;command handling&quot; classes are needed, usually organized according to the chain-of-responsibility pattern. While Cocoa retains this approach for the most part, Objective-C&#x27;s late binding opens up more flexibility.

Under Objective-C, methods are represented by a &quot;selector&quot;, a string describing the method to call. When a message is sent, the selector is sent into the Objective-C runtime, matched against a list of available methods, and the method&#x27;s &quot;implementation&quot; is called. Since the selector is text data, this lets it be saved to a file, transmitted over a network or between processes, or manipulated in other ways. The implementation of the method is looked up at runtime, not compile time. There is a small performance penalty for this, but late binding allows the same selector to reference different implementations.

By a similar token, Cocoa provides a pervasive data manipulation method called &quot;key-value coding&quot; (KVC). This allows a piece of data or property of an object to be looked up or changed at runtime by name. The property name acts as a key to the value. In traditional languages, this late binding is impossible. KVC leads to great design flexibility. An object&#x27;s type need not be known, yet any property of that object can be discovered using KVC. Also, by extending this system using something Cocoa terms &quot;key-value observing&quot; (KVO), automatic support for undo-redo is provided.

Late static binding is a variant of binding somewhere between static and dynamic binding. The binding of names before the program is run is called static (&quot;early&quot;); bindings performed as the program runs are dynamic (&quot;late&quot; or &quot;virtual&quot;).

==Rich objects==
One of the most useful features of Cocoa is the powerful &quot;base objects&quot; the system supplies. As an example, consider the Foundation classes codice_10 and codice_11, which provide Unicode strings, and the codice_12 system in AppKit, which allows the programmer to place string objects in the GUI.

codice_13 and its related classes are used to display and edit strings. The collection of objects involved permit an application to implement anything from a simple single-line text entry field to a complete multi-page, multi-column text layout schema, with full professional typography features such as kerning, ligatures, running text around arbitrary shapes, rotation, full Unicode support, and anti-aliased glyph rendering. Paragraph layout can be controlled automatically or by the user, using a built-in &quot;ruler&quot; object that can be attached to any text view. Spell checking is automatic, using a system-wide set of language dictionaries. Unlimited undo/redo support is built in. Using only the built-in features, one can write a text editor application in as few as 10 lines of code. With new controller objects, this may fall towards zero.
When extensions are needed, Cocoa&#x27;s use of Objective-C makes this a straightforward task. Objective-C includes the concept of &quot;categories,&quot; which allows modifying existing class &quot;in-place&quot;. Functionality can be accomplished in a category without any changes to the original classes in the framework, or even access to its source. In other common languages, this same task requires deriving a new subclass supporting the added features, and then replacing all instances of the original class with instances of the new subclass.

==Implementations and bindings==
The Cocoa frameworks are written in Objective-C. Java bindings for the Cocoa frameworks (termed the &quot;Java bridge&quot;) were also made available with the aim of replacing Objective-C with a more popular language but these bindings were unpopular among Cocoa developers and Cocoa&#x27;s message passing semantics did not translate well to a statically-typed language such as Java. Cocoa&#x27;s need for runtime binding means many of Cocoa&#x27;s key features are not available with Java. In 2005, Apple announced that the Java bridge was to be deprecated, meaning that features added to Cocoa in macOS versions later than 10.4 would not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.

At Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2014, Apple introduced a new programming language named Swift, which is intended to replace Objective-C.

===AppleScriptObjC===
Originally, AppleScript Studio could be used to develop simpler Cocoa applications. However, as of Snow Leopard, it has been deprecated. It was replaced with AppleScriptObjC, which allows programming in AppleScript, while using Cocoa frameworks.

===Other bindings===

The Cocoa programming environment can be accessed using other tools with the aid of bridge mechanisms such as PasCocoa, PyObjC, CamelBones, RubyCocoa, and a D/Objective-C Bridge.

Third-party bindings available for other languages include AppleScript, Clozure CL, Monobjc and NObjective (C#), Cocoa# (CLI), Cocodao and D/Objective-C Bridge, LispWorks, Object Pascal, CamelBones (Perl), PyObjC (Python), FPC PasCocoa (Lazarus and Free Pascal), RubyCocoa (Ruby).

A Ruby language implementation named MacRuby, which removes the need for a bridge mechanism, was formerly developed by Apple, while Nu is a Lisp-like language that uses the Objective-C object model directly, and thus can use the Cocoa frameworks without needing a binding.

===Other implementations===
There are also open source implementations of major parts of the Cocoa framework, such as GNUstep and Cocotron, which allow cross-platform Cocoa application development to target other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows and Linux.

<text>GNUstep is a free software implementation of the Cocoa (formerly OpenStep) Objective-C frameworks, widget toolkit, and application development tools for Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows. It is part of the GNU Project.

GNUstep features a cross-platform, object-oriented IDE. Apart from the default Objective-C interface, GNUstep also has bindings for Java, Ruby, GNU Guile and Scheme. The GNUstep developers track some additions to Apple&#x27;s Cocoa to remain compatible. The roots of the GNUstep application interface are the same as the roots of Cocoa: NeXTSTEP and OpenStep. GNUstep thus predates Cocoa, which emerged when Apple acquired NeXT&#x27;s technology and incorporated it into the development of the original Mac OS X, while GNUstep was initially an effort by GNU developers to replicate the technically ambitious NeXTSTEP&#x27;s programmer-friendly features.

== History ==
GNUstep began when Paul Kunz and others at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center wanted to port HippoDraw from NeXTSTEP to another platform. Instead of rewriting HippoDraw from scratch and reusing only the application design, they decided to rewrite the NeXTSTEP object layer on which the application depended. This was the first version of &quot;libobjcX&quot;. It enabled them to port HippoDraw to Unix systems running the X Window System without changing a single line of their application source. After the OpenStep specification was released to the public in 1994, they decided to write a new &quot;objcX&quot; which would adhere to the new APIs. The software would become known as &quot;GNUstep&quot;.

== Software architecture==
The Foundation Kit provides basic classes such as wrapper classes and data structure classes. The Application Kit provides classes oriented around graphical user interface capabilities. GNUstep contains a set of graphical control elements written in the Objective-C programming language.

The graphical user interface (GUI) of GNUMail is composed of graphics control elements. GNUMail has to interact with the windowing system, e.g. X11 or Wayland, and its graphical user interface has to be rendered. GNUstep&#x27;s backend provides a small set of functions used by the user interface library to interface to the actual windowing system. It also has a rendering engine which emulates common Postscript functions. The package gnustep-back provides the following backends:

* cairo – default backend using the Cairo 2D graphics library.
* winlib – default backend on Microsoft Windows systems. Cairo and Windows API variants.
* art – old (deprecated) backend on unix-like systems. Uses the vector-based PostScript-like 2D graphics library Libart.
* xlib – old (deprecated) X11 backend.

GNUstep inherits some design principles proposed in OPENSTEP (GNUstep predates Cocoa, but Cocoa is based on OPENSTEP) as well as the Objective-C language.

* Model–view–controller paradigm
* Target–action
* Drag-and-drop
* Delegation
* Message forwarding (through NSInvocation)

In addition to the Objective-C interface, some small projects under the GNUstep umbrella implement other APIs from Apple:
* The Boron library aims to implement the Carbon API. It is very incomplete.
* The CoreBase library is designed to be compatible with Core Foundation. It is not complete enough for the Base (Foundation Kit) component to simply be a wrapper around it.
* The QuartzCore library implements Core Animation APIs. The Opal library implements Quartz 2D.
, there are no projects that build the Swift programming language against the GNUstep Objective-C environment.

== Applications ==
Here are some examples of applications written for or ported to GNUstep.

=== Original ===
* Addresses, an address/contacts manager
* Étoilé, a desktop environment
* GNUMail, an e-mail client
* GNUstep Database Library 2, an Enterprise Objects Framework clone
* GNUstepWeb, an application server compatible with WebObjects 4.x
* Gorm, a user interface builder application, and part of the developer tools of GNUstep. Gorm is the equivalent of Interface Builder that was originally found on NeXTSTEP, then OPENSTEP, and finally on Mac OS X. It supports the old &quot;.nib&quot; files as well as its own &quot;.gorm&quot; file format.
* GWorkspace, a workspace and file manager
* Grr, an RSS feed reader
* Oolite, a clone of &quot;Elite&quot;, a space simulation game with trading components
* PRICE, imaging application
* ProjectCenter, the Project Builder or Xcode equivalent.
* TalkSoup, an IRC client
* Terminal
* Zipper, a file archiver tool
* Window Maker is a window manager that emulates NeXTSTEP&#x27;s GUI as an OpenStep-compatible environment. It was launched in 1997 as an improved take on AfterStep&#x27;s design.

=== Ported from NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, or macOS ===
* Adun
* BioCocoa
* Chess
* Cenon
* DoomEd
* EdenMath
* Eggplant
* Emacs
* Fortunate
* Gomoku
* NeXTGO
* PikoPixel
* TextEdit
* TimeMon

=== Forks of GNUstep ===
* Universal Windows Platform, which includes a WinObjC suite consisting of various parts of GNUstep and Microsoft&#x27;s own implementations of things like the Cocoa Touch API.

== See also ==

* Darling (software), a compatibility layer that relies on GNUstep
* GNUstep fat bundle
* GNUstep Renaissance, framework for XML description of portable GNUstep/Mac OS X user interfaces
* Miller Columns, the method of file tree browsing the GWorkspace File Viewer uses
* Property list, often-used file format to store user settings
* StepTalk, scripting framework

<text>Primož Trubar or Primus Truber () (1508 – 28 June 1586) was a Slovene Protestant Reformer of the Lutheran tradition, mostly known as the author of the first Slovene language printed book, the founder and the first superintendent of the Protestant Church of the Duchy of Carniola, and for consolidating the Slovenian language. Trubar introduced The Reformation in Slovenia, leading the Austrian Habsburgs to wage the Counter-Reformation, which a small Protestant community survived. Trubar is a key figure of Slovenian history and in many aspects a major historical personality.

==Life and work==
Trubar was born in the village of Rašica (now in the Municipality of Velike Lašče) in the Duchy of Carniola, then under the Habsburgs. In the years 1520–1521 he attended school in Rijeka, in 1522–1524 he continued his education in Salzburg. From there he went to Trieste under the tutorship of the Roman Catholic bishop Pietro Bonomo, where he got in touch with the Humanist writers, in particular Erasmus of Rotterdam. In 1527 the bishop Pietro Bonomo assigned Trubar a priest position in Loka pri Zidanem Mostu. In 1528 he enrolled at the University of Vienna, but did not complete his studies. In 1530 he returned to the Slovenian Lands and became a preacher in Ljubljana, where he lived up until 1565. While in Ljubljana, he lived in a house, on today&#x27;s Fish Square (&quot;Ribji trg&quot;), in the oldest part of the city. Living in Ljubljana had profound impact on his work, he considered Ljubljana the capital of all Slovenes because of its central position in the heart of the Slovene lands and because its residents spoke Slovene as their first language, unlike several other towns in today&#x27;s Slovenia. It is estimated that in Trubar&#x27;s period around 70% of Ljubljana&#x27;s 4000 inhabitants attended mass in Slovene. It was the language of Ljubljana that Trubar took as a foundation of what later became standard Slovene, with small addition of his native speech, that is Lower Carniolan dialect. Trubar considered Ljubljana&#x27;s speech most suitable, since it sounded much more noble, than his own, simple dialect of his hometown Rašica. His decision to write in Ljubljana&#x27;s variety was later adopted also by other Protestant writers, who also lived in Ljubljana during Trubar&#x27;s time. He gradually leaned towards Protestantism and was expelled from Ljubljana in 1547.

In 1550, while a Protestant preacher in Rothenburg, he wrote the first two books in Slovene, &quot;Catechismus&quot; and &quot;Abecedarium&quot;, which were then printed that year in Schwäbisch Hall by Peter Frentz. &quot;Catechismus&quot; also contained the first Slovene musical manuscript in print.

Altogether, Trubar authored 22 books in Slovene and two books in German. He was the first to translate parts of the Bible into Slovene. After the exhortation by Pier Paolo Vergerio, he translated the Gospel of Matthew in 1555 and until 1577 in three parts published the translation of the entire New Testament. In period between 1561 and 1565 Trubar was the manager and supervisor of the South Slavic Bible Institute. Eschatologically minded, he also endeavored to proselytize Muslims in Turkey with his books.

Trubar died in Derendingen, Holy Roman Empire (now part of the city of Tübingen, Germany), where he is also buried.

==Commemoration==

On June 4, 1952, the street &quot;Šentpeterska cesta&quot; in Ljubljana was renamed &quot;Trubarjeva cesta&quot; after Trubar. It is one of the oldest roads in the city, first mentioned in 1802, and starts in &quot;Prešernov trg&quot; (Prešeren Square), named after Slovenia&#x27;s national poet. The street is currently known for its high concentration of ethnic restaurants.

In 1986, Slovene television produced a TV series, directed by Andrej Strojan with the screenplay written by Drago Jančar, in which Trubar was played by the Slovene actor Polde Bibič.

Trubar was commemorated on the 10 tolar banknote in 1992, and on the Slovene 1 euro coin in 2007. In 2008, the Government of Slovenia proclaimed the Year of Primož Trubar and the 500th anniversary of Trubar&#x27;s birth was celebrated throughout the country. A commemorative €2 coin and a postage stamp were issued. An exhibition dedicated to the life and work of Primož Trubar, and the achievements of the Slovene Reformation Movement was on display at the National Museum of Slovenia from 6 March to 31 December 2008.

In 2009, the Trubar Forum Association printed Trubar&#x27;s Catechism and Abecedarium in modern Slovene, in a scholarly edition that includes both the Trubar-era Slovene and the modern Slovene translation with scholarly notes.
The &quot;Sermon on Faith&quot;, a portion of the Catechism, is available in modern Slovene, English, German and Esperanto.

Since 2010, 8 June is commemorated in Slovenia as Primož Trubar Day. Google celebrated his 505th birthday anniversary with a dedicated Google Doodle.

<doc id="55896" wikidata="Q175195" url="?curid=55896" title="Peter Gabriel">
<text>Peter Brian Gabriel (born 13 February 1950) is an English singer, songwriter, musician, and human rights activist. He came to prominence as the original frontman of the rock band Genesis. He left the band in 1975 and launched a solo career with &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; as his first single. After releasing four successful studio albums, all titled &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot;, his fifth studio album, &quot;So&quot; (1986), became his best-selling release and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the US. The album&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards. A 2011 &quot;Time&quot; report said &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; was the most played music video of all time on MTV.

A supporter of world music for much of his career, Gabriel co-founded the World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) festival in 1982, and has continued to produce and promote world music through his Real World Records label. He has pioneered digital distribution methods for music and co-founded OD2, one of the first online music download services. He has also been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts. In 1980, he released the anti-apartheid single &quot;Biko&quot;. He has participated in several human rights benefit concerts, including Amnesty International&#x27;s Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and co-founded the human rights organisation Witness in 1992. He developed the idea for The Elders, an organisation of public figures noted as peace activists, alongside Nelson Mandela and Richard Branson in 2007.

Gabriel has won three Brit Awards, six Grammy Awards, 13 MTV Video Music Awards, the first Pioneer Award at the BT Digital Music Awards, the &quot;Q&quot; Lifetime Achievement, the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Polar Music Prize. He was named a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his &quot;influence on generations of music makers&quot;. In recognition of his human rights activism, he received the Man of Peace award from the Nobel Peace Prize laureates in 2006, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. AllMusic described him as &quot;one of rock&#x27;s most ambitious, innovative musicians, as well as one of its most political&quot;. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, and as a solo artist in 2014. In recognition of his musical achievements, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of South Australia in 2015.

== Early life ==
Peter Brian Gabriel was born in Chobham on 13 February 1950, the son of Edith Irene (1921–2016) and Ralph Parton Gabriel (1912–2012). His paternal grandfather was Colonel Edward Allen, chairman of the Civil Service Department Store on London&#x27;s Strand. His mother came from a musical family, while his father was an electrical engineer and dairy farm owner from a long-established family of London timber importers and merchants. He was raised at Deep Pool Farm, a Victorian manor near Chobham. His great-great-great-uncle, Sir Thomas Gabriel, 1st Baronet, was Lord Mayor of London from 1866 to 1877. Gabriel attended the private primary school Cable House in Woking and St Andrews Preparatory School for Boys in Horsell. During his time at the latter, his teachers noticed his singing talent, but he instead opted for piano lessons from his mother and developed an interest in drumming. At age 10, he purchased a floor tom-tom.

Gabriel later remarked of his early influences, &quot;Hymns played quite a large part. They were the closest I came to soul music before I discovered soul music. There are certain hymns that you can scream your lungs out on, and I used to love that. It was great when you used to get the old shivers down the back.&quot; He wrote his first song, &quot;Sammy the Slug&quot;, at age 12. An aunt gave him money for professional singing lessons around this time, but he used it to buy the Beatles&#x27; debut album &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, which had just been released. In September 1963, he started at the public Charterhouse School in Godalming. There, he was a drummer and vocalist for his first band, the trad jazz outfit the Milords (or M&#x27;Lords). This was followed by a holiday band called the Spoken Word, which recorded an acetate in 1966. Gabriel played drums in both these bands, with Mike Rutherford later commenting, &quot;Pete wasand still is, I thinka frustrated drummer.&quot;

== Career ==
=== 1965–1975: Early career and Genesis ===
In 1965, while still at Charterhouse, Gabriel formed the band Garden Wall with his schoolmates Tony Banks on piano, Johnny Trapman on trumpet, and Chris Stewart on drums. Banks had started at Charterhouse at the same time as Gabriel, and the two were uninterested in school activities but bonded over music and started to write songs. At their final concert before they broke up, Gabriel wore a kaftan and beads and showered the audience with petals he had picked from neighbouring gardens. Garden Wall disbanded in 1967; Gabriel and Banks were invited by their Charterhouse schoolmates Anthony Phillips and Mike Rutherford, who were in their own band at the school called Anon until it split up the previous year, to work on a demo tape of songs together. Gabriel and Banks contributed &quot;She Is Beautiful&quot;, the first song they wrote together. The tape was sent to Charterhouse alumnus, musician Jonathan King, who was immediately enthusiastic largely due to Gabriel&#x27;s vocals. He signed the group and suggested that their name be Gabriel&#x27;s Angels, but this was unpopular with the other members, and they soon settled on his other suggestion of Genesis.

After King suggested they stick to more straightforward pop, Gabriel and Banks wrote &quot;The Silent Sun&quot; as a pastiche of the Bee Gees, one of King&#x27;s favourite bands. It became Genesis&#x27; first single, released in 1968, and was included on their debut studio album &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot; (1968). Following the commercial failure of &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;, the band went their separate ways, and Gabriel continued his studies at Charterhouse. In September 1969, Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, and Phillips decided to drop their plans and make Genesis a full-time band. In early 1970, Gabriel played the flute on &quot;Mona Bone Jakon&quot; by Cat Stevens. The second studio album by Genesis, &quot;Trespass&quot; (1970), marked Gabriel expanding his musical output with the flute, accordion, tambourine, and bass drum, and incorporating his soul music influences. Gabriel explained that he was driven to play these instruments because he was uncomfortable with doing nothing during instrumental sections. He would have preferred to play keyboard instruments, but said, &quot;[Banks] was extraordinarily possessive about the keyboards. I&#x27;d done a bit of flute at school, I always liked the sound, and a little bit of oboe (I was an even worse oboe player, but it made a couple of good noises now and again). Then the bass drum was something physical, visual, that I could kick hard and occasionally it was in time!&quot; The album sold few copies, with Gabriel at one point securing a place to study at the London School of Film Technique because the band &quot;seemed to be dying&quot;.

Genesis soon recruited guitarist Steve Hackett and drummer Phil Collins. Gabriel began growing in confidence as a frontman; during an encore performance of &quot;The Knife&quot; on 19 June 1971, he took a running jump into the audience and expected them to catch him, only for them to instead move out of the way and leave him to land on the floor and break his ankle. He consequently had to perform Genesis&#x27; next several shows with a wheelchair and crutches. Also during the &quot;Trespass&quot; tour, he started to recite stories to introduce songs as a way to cover the silence while the band tuned their instruments or technical faults were being fixed. These stories were all improvised on the spot, and evolved as the tour went along. The opener of their next studio album, &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; (1971), &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, was their first song in which Gabriel incorporated a story and characters into the lyrics, as the lyrics to previous story-based Genesis songs such as &quot;White Mountain&quot; and &quot;One-Eyed Hound&quot; were all written by other members of the group. Gabriel was the primary writer of &quot;Harold the Barrel&quot;, another story song on &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, with Collins helping him on the lyrics.

The shows featuring &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1972) marked a key development in Gabriel&#x27;s stage performance. During a gig in Dublin in September 1972, he disappeared from the set during the instrumental section of &quot;The Musical Box&quot; and reappeared in his wife&#x27;s red dress and a fox&#x27;s head, mimicking the album&#x27;s cover. The idea of the fox costume had been suggested to him by Paul Conroy and Glen Colson, employees of Genesis&#x27;s record label, Charisma Records. Gabriel said he consulted the rest of Genesis about the fox costume but grew tired of arguing about it, but the other members all maintained that nothing was said about it beforehand and that when Gabriel came out in costume they initially mistook him for a fan invading the stage. The incident received front-page coverage in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, giving them national exposure which allowed the group to double their performance fee. One of Gabriel&#x27;s stories was printed on the liner notes of their live album, &quot;Genesis Live&quot; (1973). By late 1973, following the success of &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; (1973), which centred on English themes and literary and materialistic references, a typical Genesis show had Gabriel wear fluorescent make-up, a cape, and bat wings for &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;, a helmet, chest plate, and a shield for &quot;Dancing with the Moonlit Knight&quot;, a crown of thorns and a flower mask for &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, and an old man mask for &quot;The Musical Box&quot;.

Gabriel continued to fight for involvement with Genesis&#x27;s keyboards throughout his time with the group, and following a lengthy argument with Banks, he was allowed to play a minor keyboard part on &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot;, only for this part to be left out of the mix. &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; became Genesis&#x27;s first hit single, reaching number 21 in the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (1974) was Gabriel&#x27;s final studio album with Genesis. He devised its story of the spiritual journey of Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City, and insisted upon writing all the lyrics himself, whereas on previous albums the lyrics had been divided among all the members of Genesis. Tensions increased during this period, and Gabriel split with the band to pursue a film project with William Friedkin, only to rejoin a week later. Matters were complicated further with the difficult birth of Gabriel&#x27;s first daughter, resulting in periods of time away from the band. The other members complained that Gabriel was showing a lack of commitment to the band. Gabriel saw this as a &quot;really unsympathetic handling of my dealing with a family crisis&quot; and said it caused a breakdown in his relationships with the rest of Genesis; Rutherford later admitted that they had been overly fixated on their music and were very unhelpful in what must have been a difficult time for Gabriel. Gabriel was late to deliver the lyrics, but has denied that he was too busy to write much music for the album and relied on contributions from Banks and Rutherford. Banks corroborated that Gabriel was the primary composer of the &quot;Lamb&quot; songs &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; and &quot;The Chamber of 32 Doors&quot; and the sole composer of &quot;Counting Out Time&quot;.

During a stop in Cleveland, Ohio, early into the album&#x27;s tour, Gabriel informed the band of his intention to leave at its conclusion. Rutherford recalled that they all &quot;could see it coming&quot;. Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel&#x27;s theatrics and took the band&#x27;s musical performance as secondary, which irritated the rest of the band. The tour ended in May 1975, after which Gabriel wrote a piece for the press on 15 August, entitled &quot;Out, Angels Out&quot;, about his departure, his disillusion with the business, and his desire to spend time with his family. The news stunned fans of the group and left commentators wondering if the band could survive without him. His exit resulted in drummer Phil Collins reluctantly taking over on lead vocals after 400 singers were fruitlessly auditioned.

=== 1975–1985: Solo debut with four self-titled albums ===
Gabriel described his break from the music business as his &quot;learning period&quot;, during which he took piano and music lessons. He had recorded demos by the end of 1975, the fruits of a period of writing around 20 songs with his friend Martin Hall. In 1977, Gabriel released his solo debut, &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot;, which was recorded in Toronto with Bob Ezrin serving as the album&#x27;s producer. Gabriel did not title his first four studio albums. All were labelled &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot;, using the same typeface, with designs by Hipgnosis. &quot;The idea is to do it like a magazine, which will only come out once a year,&quot; he remarked in 1978. &quot;So it&#x27;s the same title, the same lettering in the same place; only the photo is different.&quot;

&quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Peter Gabriel 1: Car&quot;) was released in February 1977 and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 38 in the US. Its lead single, &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot;, is an autobiographical song about a spiritual experience on top of Solsbury Hill in Somerset. &quot;It&#x27;s about being prepared to lose what you have for what you might get ...&quot; said Gabriel. &quot;It&#x27;s about letting go.&quot; Gabriel toured the album with an 80-date tour from March to November 1977 with a band that included guitarist Robert Fripp of King Crimson often playing off stage and introduced as &quot;Dusty Rhodes&quot;.
In late 1977, Gabriel started recording the second &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; studio album (a.k.a. &quot;Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch&quot;) in the Netherlands, with Fripp as producer. Its &quot;Mother of Violence&quot; was written by Gabriel and his first wife Jill. Released in June 1978, the album went to No. 10 in the UK and No. 45 in the US. Gabriel&#x27;s tour for the album lasted from August to December 1978. On this tour, Gabriel and his band shaved their heads.

Gabriel recorded the third &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; studio album (a.k.a. &quot;Peter Gabriel 3: Melt&quot;) in England in 1979. He developed an interest in African music and drum machines and later hailed the record as his artistic breakthrough. Gabriel banned the use of cymbals on the album in order to grant more sonic space for instruments like keyboards and synths. This resulted in the creation of the distinctive gated reverb, a noise processing technique which came about while recording drums on &quot;Intruder&quot;, one of the tracks featuring Phil Collins. Collins implemented the reverb to great effect on his debut solo single &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; and it has since became a signature sound of the 1980s and beyond.

Upon completion Atlantic Records, Gabriel&#x27;s US distributor who had released his first two albums, refused to put out &quot;Peter Gabriel 3: Melt&quot; as they thought it was not commercial enough. Gabriel signed a recording contract with Mercury Records. Released in May 1980, the album went to No. 1 in the UK for three weeks. In the US, it peaked at No. 22. The single &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; went to No. 4 and &quot;Biko&quot; went to No. 36 in the UK. After a handful of shows in 1979, Gabriel toured the album from February to October 1980. The tour marked Gabriel&#x27;s first successful instance of crowd surfing (following his failed June 1971 attempt when touring with Genesis) when he fell back into the audience in a crucifix position. The stunt became a staple of his live shows.
On &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; four (a.k.a. &quot;Peter Gabriel 4: Security&quot;), Gabriel took on greater responsibility over the production than before. He recorded it in 1981 and 1982, solely on digital tape, with a mobile studio parked at his home, Ashcombe House, in Somerset. Gabriel utilized a Fairlight CMI digital sampling synthesizer and incorporated electronic instrumentation with sampling world beat percussion. &quot;Over the course of the last two albums,&quot; he observed, &quot;I&#x27;ve got back into a rhythm consciousness. And the writing—particularly with the invention of these drum machines—is fantastic. You can store in their memories rhythms that interest you and excite you. And then the groove will carry on without you, and the groove will be exactly what you want it to be, rather than what a drummer thinks is appropriate for what you&#x27;re doing.&quot;

The fourth &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot;, released in September 1982, hit No. 6 in the UK and No. 28 in the US. The second single, &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot;, became Gabriel&#x27;s first top 40 hit in the US, reaching No. 29. To handle American distribution, Gabriel signed with Geffen Records, which—initially unbeknown to Gabriel—titled the album &quot;Security&quot; to differentiate it from the first three. Gabriel&#x27;s 1982 tour lasted a year and became his first to make a profit. Recordings from the tour were released on Gabriel&#x27;s debut live release, &quot;Plays Live&quot; (1983).

Gabriel produced versions of the third and fourth &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; albums with German lyrics. The third consisted of the studio recordings, overdubbed with new vocals. The fourth was remixed, with several tracks extended or altered.

In 1983, Gabriel developed the soundtrack for Alan Parker&#x27;s drama film &quot;Birdy&quot; (1984), co-produced with Daniel Lanois. This consisted of new material, without lyrics, as well as remixed instrumentals from his previous studio album.

===1985–1997: &quot;So&quot; and &quot;Us&quot;===
After finishing the soundtrack to &quot;Birdy&quot;, Gabriel shifted his musical focus from rhythm and texture, as heard on &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; four and &quot;Birdy&quot;, towards more straightforward songs. In 1985, he recorded his fifth studio album, &quot;So&quot; (also co-produced with Lanois). &quot;So&quot; was released in May 1986 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in the US. It remains Gabriel&#x27;s best-selling album with over five million copies sold in the US alone. It produced one of Gabriel&#x27;s signature songs, that has become a concert staple: &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, with a distinctive vocal appearance by Youssou N&#x27;Dour, and three UK top 20 singles: &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, &quot;Big Time&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, a duet with Kate Bush.

The first went to No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Gabriel&#x27;s only single of his career to do so. It knocked &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; by Genesis, his former band, out of the top spot, which was also their only US number one hit. In the UK, the single went to No. 4. In 1990, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;So&quot; at No. 14 on its list of &quot;Top 100 Albums of the Eighties&quot;.
&quot;Sledgehammer&quot; was particularly successful, dealing with sex and sexual relations through lyrical innuendos. Its famed music video was a collaboration between director Stephen R. Johnson, Aardman Animations, and the Brothers Quay and won a record nine MTV Video Music Awards in 1987. In 1998, it was named MTV&#x27;s number one animated video of all time. &quot;So&quot; earned Gabriel two wins at the 1987 Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and Best British Video (for &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;). He was nominated for four Grammy Awards: Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year for &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, and Album of the Year for &quot;So&quot;. Gabriel toured worldwide to support &quot;So&quot; with the This Way Up Tour, from November 1986 to October 1987.

In 1988, Gabriel became involved as composer for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988). Scorsese had contacted Gabriel about the project since 1983 and wished, according to Gabriel, to present &quot;the struggle between the humanity and divinity of Christ in a powerful and original way&quot;. Gabriel used musicians from WOMAD to perform instrumental pieces with focus on rhythm and African, Middle Eastern and European textures, using the National Sound Archive in London for additional inspiration. The initial plan had dedicated ten weeks for recording before it was cut to three, leaving Gabriel unable to finish all the pieces he originally wanted to record. When the film was finished, Gabriel worked on the soundtrack for an additional four months to develop more of his unfinished ideas. Its soundtrack was released as &quot;Passion&quot; in June 1989. It won Gabriel a Grammy Award for Best New Age Performance and a nomination for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score – Motion Picture. In 1990, Gabriel put out his first compilation album, &quot;Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats&quot;, which sold 2 million copies in the US.

Up until 1989, Gabriel was managed by Gail Colson. From 1989 to 1992, Gabriel recorded his follow-up to &quot;So&quot;, titled &quot;Us&quot;. The album saw Gabriel address personal themes, including his failed first marriage, psychotherapy, and the growing distance between him and his eldest daughter at the time.

Gabriel&#x27;s introspection within the context of the album &quot;Us&quot; can be seen in the first single release &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot; directed by John Downer. Accompanied by a video featuring Gabriel covered in snails and various foliage, this song made reference to the psychotherapy which had taken up much of Gabriel&#x27;s time since the previous studio album. Gabriel describes his struggle to get through to his daughter in &quot;Come Talk to Me&quot; directed by Matt Mahurin, which featured backing vocals by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. O&#x27;Connor also lent vocals to &quot;Blood of Eden&quot;, directed by Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson, the third single to be released from the album, and once again dealing with relationship struggles, this time going right back to Adam&#x27;s rib for inspiration.

The album is one of Gabriel&#x27;s most personal. It met with less success than &quot;So&quot;, reaching No. 2 in the album chart on both sides of the Atlantic, and making modest chart impact with the singles &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot; and the funkier &quot;Steam&quot;, which evoked memories of &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;. Gabriel followed the release of the album with the Secret World Tour, first using touring keyboardist Joy Askew to sing O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s part, then O&#x27;Connor herself for a few months. O&#x27;Connor quit the tour, and was replaced by Paula Cole, the latter appearing on the tour recordings: a double album &quot;Secret World Live&quot;, and a concert video also called &quot;Secret World Live&quot;, both released in 1994. The film received the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video, naming director Francois Girard and producer Robert Warr.

Gabriel employed an innovative approach in the marketing of the &quot;Us&quot; album. Not wishing to feature only images of himself, he asked artist filmmakers Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson to co-ordinate a marketing campaign using contemporary artists. Artists such as Helen Chadwick, Rebecca Horn, Nils-Udo, Andy Goldsworthy, David Mach and Yayoi Kusama collaborated to create original artworks for each song on the multi-million-selling CD. Coulson and Bruce documented the process on Hi-8 video. Bruce left Real World and Coulson continued with the campaign, using the documentary background material as the basis for a promotional EPK, the long-form video &quot;All About Us&quot; and the interactive CD-ROM &quot;Xplora1: Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Secret World&quot;.

Gabriel won three more Grammy Awards, all in the Music Video category. He won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 1993 and 1994 for the videos to &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot; and &quot;Steam&quot;, respectively. Gabriel also won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video for his &quot;Secret World Live&quot; video.

===1997–2009: &quot;OVO&quot; and &quot;Up&quot; ===
In 1997, Gabriel was invited to participate in the direction and soundtrack of the Millennium Dome Show, a live multimedia performance staged in the Millennium Dome in London throughout 2000. Gabriel said the team were given free rein, which contributed to the various problems they encountered with it, such as a lack of proper budgeting. He also felt that management, while succeeding to get the building finished on time, failed to understand the artistic side of the show and its content. Gabriel&#x27;s soundtrack was released as &quot;OVO&quot; in June 2000. The Story of OVO was released in the CD-booklet-shaped comic book which was part of the CD edition with the title &quot;OVO The Millennium Show&quot;.

Around that same time, the Genesis greatest hits album, &quot;Turn It On Again: The Hits&quot; (1999), featured Gabriel sharing vocals with Phil Collins on a new version of &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; entitled &quot;The Carpet Crawlers 1999&quot;, produced by Trevor Horn.

In 2002 he stuck with soundtrack work for his next project, scoring for the Australian film &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; (2002) with worldbeat music. Released in June 2002, &quot;Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Score – Motion Picture.

Later in 2002, &quot;Up&quot;, Gabriel&#x27;s first full-length studio album in a decade, was released in September 2002. He started work on it in 1995 before production halted three years later to focus time on other projects and collaborations. Work resumed in 2000, by which time Gabriel had 130 potential songs for the album, and spent almost two years on it before management at Virgin Records pushed Gabriel to complete it. &quot;Up&quot; reached No. 9 in the US and No. 11 in the UK, and supported with a world tour with a band that included Gabriel&#x27;s daughter Melanie on backing vocals. The tour was documented with two live DVDs: &quot;Growing Up Live&quot; (2003) and &quot;Still Growing Up: Live &amp; Unwrapped&quot; (2005).

In 2004, Gabriel met with his former Genesis bandmates to discuss the possibility of staging &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (1974) as a reunion tour. He ultimately dismissed the idea, paving the way for Banks, Rutherford and Collins to organise the Turn It On Again: The Tour. Gabriel produced and performed at the Eden Project Live 8 concert in July 2005. He joined Cat Stevens on stage to perform &quot;Wild World&quot; during Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 46664 concert. In 2005, FIFA asked Gabriel and Brian Eno to organise an opening ceremony for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, but FIFA cancelled the idea in January 2006. At the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Gabriel performed John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;.

In November 2006, the Seventh World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in Rome presented Gabriel with the Man of Peace award. The award, presented by former General Secretary of the USSR and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mikhail Gorbachev and Walter Veltroni, Mayor of Rome, was an acknowledgement of Gabriel&#x27;s extensive contribution and work on behalf of human rights and peace. The award was presented in the Giulio Cesare Hall of the Campidoglio in Rome. At the end of the year, he was awarded the &quot;Q&quot; magazine Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to him by American musician Moby. In an interview published in the magazine to accompany the award, Gabriel&#x27;s contribution to music was described as &quot;vast and enduring&quot;.

Gabriel took on a project with the BBC World Service&#x27;s competition &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot; to find the world&#x27;s best young band. Gabriel judged the final six young artists with William Orbit, Geoff Travis and Angélique Kidjo.

In June 2008, Gabriel released &quot;Big Blue Ball&quot;, an album of various artists collaborating with each other at his Real World Studios across three summers in the 1990s. He planned its release in the US without assistance from a label; he raised £2 million towards the recording and distribution of the album with Ingenious Media with the worldwide release handled through Warner Bros. Records. Gabriel appeared on a nationwide tour for the album in 2009.

Gabriel was a judge for the 6th and 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.

Gabriel contributed to the Pixar film &quot;WALL-E&quot; soundtrack in 2008 with Thomas Newman, including the film&#x27;s closing song, &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, for which they received the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. The song was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and an Academy Award for Best Original Song. In February 2009, Gabriel announced that he would not be performing on the 2008 Academy Awards telecast because producers of the show were limiting his performance of &quot;Down to Earth&quot; from &quot;WALL-E&quot; to 90 seconds. According to Gabriel, his window was reduced to 65 seconds. John Legend and the Soweto Gospel Choir performed the song in his stead.

Gabriel&#x27;s 2009 tour appearances included Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Venezuela. His first ever performance in Peru was held in Lima on 20 March 2009, during his second visit to the country.

On 25 July 2009, he played at WOMAD Charlton Park, his only European performance of the year, to promote Witness. The show included two tracks from the then-forthcoming &quot;Scratch My Back&quot;: Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; and the Magnetic Fields&#x27; &quot;The Book of Love&quot;.

===2009–2019: &quot;Scratch My Back&quot;, &quot;New Blood&quot; and further side projects===

In 2009, Gabriel recorded &quot;Scratch My Back&quot;, an album of cover songs by various artists including David Bowie, Lou Reed, Arcade Fire, Radiohead, Regina Spektor and Neil Young. The original concept was for Gabriel to cover an artists&#x27; song if they, in turn, covered one of his for an album simultaneously released as &quot;I&#x27;ll Scratch Yours&quot;, but several participants later declined or were late to deliver and it was placed on hold. Gabriel avoided using drums and guitar in favour of orchestral arrangements, and altered his usual songwriting method by finishing the vocals first and then the song, for which he collaborated with John Metcalfe. Released in February 2010, &quot;Scratch My Back&quot; reached No. 12 in the UK. Gabriel toured worldwide with the New Blood Tour from March 2010 to July 2012 with a 54-piece orchestra and his daughter Melanie and Norwegian singer-songwriter Ane Brun on backing vocals. The follow-up, &quot;And I&#x27;ll Scratch Yours&quot;, was released in September 2013.

During the New Blood Tour, Gabriel decided to expand on the &quot;Scratch My Back&quot; concept and, with Metcalfe&#x27;s assistance, re-record a collection of his own songs with an orchestra. The result, &quot;New Blood&quot;, was released in October 2011.

In September 2012, Gabriel kicked off his Back to Front Tour which featured &quot;So&quot; (1986) performed in its entirety with the original musicians who played on the album, to mark its 25th anniversary. When the opening leg finished a month later, Gabriel took one year off to travel the world with his children. The tour resumed with a European leg from September 2013 to December 2014.

In 2014, Gabriel was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. They performed Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Washing of the Water&quot; together. Gabriel performed &quot;Heroes&quot; by David Bowie with an orchestra at a concert in Berlin to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 2014.

In 2016, he was featured on the song &quot;A.I.&quot; by American pop rock band OneRepublic from their fourth studio album &quot;Oh My My&quot;.

In June 2016, Gabriel released the single &quot;I&#x27;m Amazing&quot;. The song was written several years prior, in part as a tribute to boxer Muhammad Ali. That month, he embarked on a joint tour with Sting titled The Rock Paper Scissors North American Tour.

Gabriel re-emerged in 2019 with the release of &quot;Rated PG&quot;, a compilation of songs that were created for film soundtracks throughout his career. The song selection spans over 30 years and includes tracks that had never been released on an official Gabriel album previously, including &quot;Down to Earth&quot; (from &quot;WALL-E&quot;) and &quot;That&#x27;ll Do&quot; (from &quot;&quot;), an Oscar-nominated collaboration with Randy Newman. Initially only released on vinyl for Record Store Day on 13 April, the album was eventually released on digital streaming services later that month. Later that same year, Gabriel issued another digital release on 13 September titled &quot;Flotsam and Jetsam&quot;, a collection of B-sides, remixes and rarities that span Gabriel&#x27;s entire solo career from 1976 to 2016, including his first solo recording, a cover of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.

=== 2022–present: &quot;I/O&quot; and &quot;O/I&quot; ===
By 2002, Gabriel had been continually working on what he had given the tentative title of &quot;I/O&quot;, his tenth studio album, which he had begun work on as early as 1995. It was originally set to be released 18 months after &quot;Up&quot;, but touring pushed the release far away. He did an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2005 stating that he had 150 songs in various stages. From 2013 to 2016, he posted regularly on social media about recording the new album. In 2019, he spoke on BBC Radio 6 about how he had taken a hiatus from making music due to his wife being sick, but he had begun to return to it now that she had recovered. In 2021, he was interviewed multiple times about his new album, and revealed that he had been recording with Manu Katché, Tony Levin and David Rhodes on 17 new songs. He posted multiple photos to his Facebook and Instagram of these sessions. In June 2022, Katché told the French magazine &quot;L&#x27;Illustré&quot; that the album was nearly complete and would be released later that year, pending an official announcement.

In November 2022, Gabriel announced his upcoming &quot;I/O The Tour&quot; for the spring of 2023 across several European cities, with later dates to be confirmed for the North America leg of the tour for the late summer/fall of 2023. This announcement also confirmed the name of the upcoming album to be stylised as &quot;I/O&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;Panopticom&quot;, was released digitally on 6 January 2023. A new piece from the album will be released on the date of each full moon in 2023, as well as a different mix of the song on each new moon in 2023, starting with the Dark Side Mix of &quot;Panopticom&quot;. On 5 February, Gabriel released &quot;The Court&quot;, the second single from the album. On 7 March, Gabriel released the third single, &quot;Playing for Time&quot;. A basic arrangement of the song featuring only Gabriel on piano and Levin on bass had already opened the shows on the Back to Front Tour, by the name of &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot;. The title track &quot;I/O&quot; was the fourth single released on 6 April. On 5 May, Peter Gabriel released the fifth single from the album, &quot;Four Kinds of Horses&quot;, a track which is a collaboration with Brian Eno and Richard Russell. The sixth single, &quot;Road to Joy&quot;, was released on 4 June. Six more singles were released, separately, within the next six months—&quot;So Much&quot;, &quot;Olive Tree&quot;, &quot;Love Can Heal&quot;, &quot;This Is Home&quot;, &quot;And Still&quot; and &quot;Live and Let Live&quot;—before &quot;I/O&quot; was finally released on 1 December 2023.

One day prior to &quot;I/O&quot;″s release, Gabriel told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he does not expect a follow-up album (which he described as his &quot;brain project&quot;) to take another 21 years, saying that &quot;there&#x27;s a lot of stuff in the can&quot; but added that the material is not yet finished.

Additionally, Gabriel stated in his November 2023 Full Moon update video that the track &quot;What Lies Ahead&quot; will be on &quot;the next record&quot;. He performed &quot;What Lies Ahead&quot; several times in 2023 and it was a contender for &quot;I/O&quot;. In February 2025, Gabriel revealed to &quot;Mojo&quot; that he was working on the follow-up to &quot;I/O&quot;: &quot;It will be called &quot;O/I&quot; [...] that&#x27;s &quot;I/O&quot; backwards.&quot;

== Artistry ==
Stylistically, Gabriel&#x27;s music has been alternately described by music writers as progressive rock, art rock, art pop, worldbeat, post-progressive and progressive soul. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Ryan Reed, Gabriel has developed in all as an &quot;art-rock innovator, soul-pop craftsman, [and] &#x27;world music&#x27; ambassador&quot; over the course of his career, while music scholar Gregg Akkermann argues that, despite his progressive rock origins, he has &quot;managed to attract fans from across the spectrum: prog rock, alternative rock, world beat, blue-eyed soul, dance music, the college crowd, the teens, Americans and Europeans&quot;. More broadly, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine says Gabriel emerged during the 1980s as &quot;one of rock&#x27;s most ambitious, innovative musicians&quot;, as well as &quot;an international pop star&quot;.

Gabriel has worked with a relatively stable crew of musicians and recording engineers throughout his solo career. Bass and Stick player Tony Levin has performed on every Gabriel studio album and every live tour except for &quot;Scratch My Back&quot; (2010), the soundtracks &quot;Passion&quot; (1989) and &quot;Long Walk Home&quot; (2002), and the New Blood Tour. Guitarist David Rhodes has been Gabriel&#x27;s guitarist of choice since 1979. Prior to &quot;So&quot; (1986), Jerry Marotta was Gabriel&#x27;s preferred drummer, both in the studio and on the road. (For the &quot;So&quot; and &quot;Us&quot; albums and tours Marotta was replaced by Manu Katché, who was then replaced by Ged Lynch on parts of the &quot;Up&quot; album and all of the subsequent tour). Gabriel is known for choosing top-flight collaborators, from co-producers such as Ezrin, Fripp, Lillywhite and Lanois to musicians such as Natalie Merchant, Elizabeth Fraser, L. Shankar, Trent Reznor, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Larry Fast, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Kate Bush, Ane Brun, Paula Cole, John Giblin, Dave Gregory, Peter Hammill, Papa Wemba, Manu Katché, Bayete, Milton Nascimento, Phil Collins, Stewart Copeland and OneRepublic.

Over the years, Gabriel has collaborated with singer Kate Bush several times; Bush provided backing vocals for Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; and &quot;No Self Control&quot; in 1980, and female lead vocal for &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; (a top 10 hit in the UK) in 1986, and Gabriel appeared on her television special. Their duet of Roy Harper&#x27;s &quot;Another Day&quot; was discussed for release as a single, but never appeared.

He also collaborated with avant-garde artist Laurie Anderson on two versions of her composition &quot;Excellent Birds&quot;—one for her second album &quot;Mister Heartbreak&quot; (1984), and another version called &quot;This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)&quot;, which appeared on cassette and CD versions of &quot;So&quot;.

Gabriel sang (along with Jim Kerr of Simple Minds) on &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot;, from the Call&#x27;s 1986 studio album, &quot;Reconciled&quot;. On Toni Childs&#x27; 1994 studio album, &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Boat&quot;, Gabriel sang on the track, &quot;I Met a Man&quot;.

In 1998, Gabriel appeared on the soundtrack of &quot;&quot; as the lead vocalist of the song &quot;That&#x27;ll Do&quot;, written by Randy Newman. The song was nominated for an Academy Award, and Gabriel and Newman performed it at the following year&#x27;s Oscar telecast. He performed a similar soundtrack appearance for the 2004 film &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;, singing a cover version of &quot;The Book of Love&quot; by the Magnetic Fields.

In 1987, Gabriel appeared on Robbie Robertson&#x27;s self-titled solo studio album, singing on &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;; co-wrote two Tom Robinson singles; and appeared on Joni Mitchell&#x27;s 1988 studio album &quot;Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm&quot;, on the opening track &quot;My Secret Place&quot;.

In 2001, Gabriel contributed lead vocals to the song &quot;When You&#x27;re Falling&quot; on Afro Celt Sound System&#x27;s &quot;Volume 3: Further in Time&quot;. In the summer of 2003, Gabriel performed in Ohio with a guest performance by Uzbek singer Sevara Nazarkhan.

Gabriel collaborated on tracks with electronic musician BT, who also worked on the &quot;OVO&quot; soundtrack with him. The tracks were never released, as the computers they were contained on were stolen from BT&#x27;s home in California. He also sang the lyrics for Deep Forest on their theme song for the movie &quot;Strange Days&quot; (1995). In addition, Gabriel has appeared on Angelique Kidjo&#x27;s 2007 studio album &quot;Djin Djin&quot;, singing on the song &quot;Salala&quot;.

Gabriel has recorded a cover of the Vampire Weekend single &quot;Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa&quot; with Hot Chip, where his name is mentioned several times in the chorus. He substitutes the original line &quot;But this feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / This feels so unnatural/ Peter Gabriel too&quot; with &quot;It feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / and it feels so unnatural / to sing your own name.&quot;

Gabriel collaborated with Arcade Fire on their 2022 studio album, &quot;We&quot;. He sang backing vocals on the track &quot;Unconditional II (Race and Religion)&quot;.

== WOMAD and other projects ==
Gabriel&#x27;s interest in world music was first apparent on his third solo studio album. According to Spencer Kornhaber in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2019: &quot;When Peter Gabriel moved toward &#x27;world music&#x27; four decades ago, he not only evangelized sounds that were novel to Western pop. He also set a radio template: majestic, with flourishes meant to read as &#x27;exotic,&#x27; and lyrics meant to change lives.&quot; This influence has increased over time, and he is the driving force behind the World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) movement. Gabriel said:

Gabriel created the Real World Studios and record label to facilitate the creation and distribution of such music by various artists, and he has worked to educate Western culture about such musicians as Yungchen Lhamo, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Youssou N&#x27;dour.

He has a longstanding interest in human rights and launched Witness, a charity that trains human rights activists to use video and online technologies to expose human rights abuses. In 2006, his work with WITNESS and his long-standing support of peace and human rights causes was recognised by the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates with the Man of Peace award.

In the 1990s, with Steve Nelson of Brilliant Media and director Michael Coulson, he developed advanced multimedia CD-ROM-based entertainment projects, creating &quot;Xplora&quot; (the world&#x27;s largest-selling music CD-ROM), and subsequently the &quot;EVE&quot; CD-ROM. &quot;EVE&quot; was a music and art adventure game directed by Michael Coulson and co-produced by the Starwave Corporation in Seattle; it won the Milia d&#x27;Or award Grand Prize at the Cannes in 1996.

In 1990, Gabriel lent his backing vocals to Ugandan political exile Geoffrey Oryema&#x27;s &quot;Land of Anaka&quot;, appearing on Oryema&#x27;s first studio album &quot;Exile&quot;, released on Gabriel&#x27;s Real World label.

In 1994, Gabriel starred in Breck Eisner&#x27;s short film &quot;Recon&quot; as a detective who enters the minds of murder victims to find their killer&#x27;s identity.

Gabriel helped pioneer a new realm of musical interaction in 2001, visiting Georgia State University&#x27;s Language Research Center to participate in keyboard jam sessions with bonobo apes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. (This experience inspired the song &quot;Animal Nation&quot;, which was performed on Gabriel&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Growing Up&quot; tour and was featured on the &quot;Growing Up Live&quot; DVD and &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot; soundtrack.) Gabriel&#x27;s desire to bring attention to the intelligence of primates also took the form of ApeNet, a project that aimed to link great apes through the internet, enabling the first interspecies internet communication.

He was one of the founders of on Demand Distribution (OD2), one of the first online music download services. Prior to its closure in 2009, its technology had been used by over 100 music download sites including MSN Music UK, MyCokeMusic, Planet Internet (KPN), Wanadoo and CD WOW!. OD2 was bought by US company Loudeye in June 2004 and subsequently by Finnish mobile giant Nokia in October 2006 for $60 million.

Gabriel is co-founder (with Brian Eno) of a musicians union called Mudda, short for &quot;magnificent union of digitally downloading artists&quot;.

In 2000, Gabriel collaborated with Zucchero, Anggun and others in a charity for kids with AIDS. Erick Benzi wrote words and music and Patrick Bruel, Stephan Eicher, Faudel, Lokua Kanza, Laam, Nourith, Axelle Red have accepted to sing it.

In 2003, Gabriel contributed a song for the video game &quot;Uru: Ages Beyond Myst&quot;. In 2004, Gabriel contributed another song (&quot;Curtains&quot;) and contributed voice work on another game in the Myst franchise, &quot;Myst IV: Revelation&quot;.

In June 2005, Gabriel and broadcast industry entrepreneur David Engelke purchased Solid State Logic, a manufacturer of mixing consoles and digital audio workstations. In 2017, the company was sold to the Audiotonix Group.

In May 2008, Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios, in partnership with Bowers &amp; Wilkins, started the Bowers &amp; Wilkins Music Club—later known as Society of Sound—a subscription-based music retail site. Albums are currently available in either Apple Lossless or FLAC format.

He is one of the founding supporters of the annual global event Asteroid Day.

== Activist for humanitarian causes ==
In 1986, he started what has become a longstanding association with Amnesty International, becoming a pioneering participant in all 28 of Amnesty&#x27;s &quot;Human rights concerts&quot;—a series of music events and tours staged by the US Section of Amnesty International between 1986 and 1998. He performed during the six-concert &quot;A Conspiracy of Hope&quot; US tour in June 1986; the twenty-concert &quot;Human Rights Now!&quot; world tour in 1988; the &quot;Chile: Embrace of Hope Concert&quot; in 1990 and at &quot;The Paris Concert for Amnesty International&quot; in 1998. He also performed in Amnesty&#x27;s &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; benefit shows in collaboration with other artists and friends such as Lou Reed, David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Youssou N&#x27;Dour; Gabriel closed those concerts performing his anti-apartheid anthem &quot;Biko&quot;.
He spoke of his support for Amnesty on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; in 1986.

Inspired by the social activism he encountered in his work with Amnesty, in 1992, Gabriel co-founded WITNESS, a non-profit organisation that equips, trains and supports locally based organisations worldwide to use video and the internet in human rights documentation and advocacy.

In 1995, Gabriel and Cape Verdean human rights activist Vera Duarte were awarded the North–South Prize in its inaugural year.
In the late 1990s, Gabriel and entrepreneur Richard Branson discussed with Nelson Mandela their idea of a small, dedicated group of leaders, working objectively and without any vested personal interest to solve difficult global conflicts.

On 18 July 2007, in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela announced the formation of a new group, The Elders, in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday. Kofi Annan served as Chair of the Elders and Gro Harlem Brundtland as deputy chair. The other members of the group are Martti Ahtisaari, Ela Bhatt, Lakhdar Brahimi, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Jimmy Carter, Hina Jilani, Graça Machel, Mary Robinson and Ernesto Zedillo. Desmond Tutu was an Honorary Elder, as was Nelson Mandela. The Elders is independently funded by a group of donors, including Branson and Gabriel.

The Elders use their collective skills to catalyse peaceful resolutions to long-standing conflicts, articulate new approaches to global issues that are causing or may later cause immense human suffering, and share wisdom by helping to connect voices all over the world. They work together to consider carefully which specific issues to approach.

In November 2007, Gabriel&#x27;s non-profit group WITNESS launched The Hub, a participatory media site for human rights.

In September 2008, Gabriel was named as the recipient of Amnesty International&#x27;s 2008 &quot;Ambassador of Conscience Award&quot;. In the same month, he received Quadriga &quot;United We Care&quot; award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling and Wikipedia. The award was presented to him by Queen Silvia of Sweden.

In 2010, Gabriel lent his support to the campaign to release Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian Azeri woman who was sentenced to death by stoning after being convicted of committing adultery.

In December 2013, Gabriel posted a video message in tribute to the deceased former South African president and anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela. Gabriel was quoted:

Gabriel has criticised Air France for their continued transport of monkeys to laboratories. In a letter to the airline, Gabriel wrote that in laboratories, &quot;primates are violently force-fed chemicals, inflicted with brain damage, crippled, addicted to cocaine or alcohol, deprived of food and water, or psychologically tormented and ultimately killed.&quot;

In March 2014, Gabriel publicly supported #withsyria, a campaign to rally support for victims of the Syrian Civil War.

In November 2014, Gabriel, along with Pussy Riot and Iron &amp; Wine supported Hong Kong protesters at Hong Kong&#x27;s Lennon Wall in their efforts.

In March 2015, Gabriel was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of South Australia in recognition of his commitment to creativity and its transformational power in building peace and understanding.

He composed the song &quot;The Veil&quot; for Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;Snowden&quot; (2016).

== Political views ==
Gabriel has been described as one of rock&#x27;s most political musicians by AllMusic. In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday massacre, Gabriel joined Peter Hain, Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Benn, Ken Loach, John Pilger and Adrian Mitchell in voicing his support for a demonstration in London calling for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.

At the 1997 general election, he declared his support for the Labour Party, which won that election by a landslide after 18 years out of power, led by Tony Blair. In 1998, he was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to Labour. He subsequently distanced himself from the Labour government following Tony Blair&#x27;s support for George W. Bush and Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Iraq War, which he strongly opposed. Gabriel later explained his decision for funding Labour, saying, &quot;after all those years of Thatcher, that was the only time I&#x27;ve put money into a political party because I wanted to help get rid of the Tory government of that time.&quot;

In 2005, Gabriel gave a Green Party of England and Wales general election candidate special permission to record a cover of his song &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; for his campaign. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Gabriel as &quot;a staunch advocate of proportional representation&quot;. In 2013, he stated that he had become more interested in online petitioning organisations to effect change than traditional party politics.

In 2012, Gabriel condemned the use of his music by the American conservative talk radio personality Rush Limbaugh during a controversial segment in which Limbaugh vilified Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke. A statement on behalf of Gabriel read: &quot;Peter was appalled to learn that his music was linked to Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s extraordinary attack on Sandra Fluke. It is obvious from anyone that knows Peter&#x27;s work that he would never approve such a use. He has asked his representatives to make sure his music is withdrawn and especially from these unfair, aggressive and ignorant comments.&quot;

In 2016, Gabriel supported the UK&#x27;s continued membership of the European Union in the referendum on the issue.

Gabriel has declared his support for the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 2014, he contributed songs to a new compilation album to raise funds for humanitarian organisations aiding Palestinian Arabs in Gaza. Gabriel was quoted: &quot;I am certain that Israelis and Palestinians will both benefit from a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. We have watched Palestinians suffer for too long, especially in Gaza. I am not, and never was, anti-Israeli or anti-Semitic, but I oppose the policy of the Israeli government, oppose injustice and oppose the occupation ... I am proud to be one of the voices asking the Israeli government: &#x27;Where is the two-state solution that you wanted so much?&#x27; and clearly say that enough is enough.&quot; In 2019, Gabriel was among 50 artists who urged the BBC to ask for the Eurovision Song Contest to be moved out of Israel, citing human rights concerns. In 2023, Gabriel signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter to President Joe Biden calling for a ceasefire during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

Gabriel has been in support of the Armenian genocide recognition. In October 2020, he posted a message on social media in support of Armenia and Artsakh in regards to the Nagorno-Karabakh war. He said, &quot;The fighting that has now broken out between Azerbaijan and Armenia is really horrific and we need to lobby whoever we can to encourage a ceasefire, but hearing reports that President Erdoğan has now lined up 80,000 Turkish troops on the Armenian border is a terrifying prospect, full of the dark echoes of history.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
Gabriel&#x27;s music featured prominently on the popular 1980s television show &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. The songs include &quot;The Rhythm of the Heat&quot; and &quot;Biko&quot; (from &quot;Evan&quot;), &quot;Red Rain&quot; (from &quot;Stone&#x27;s War&quot;), &quot;Mercy Street&quot; (from &quot;Killshot&quot;), &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; (from &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot;), &quot;We Do What We&#x27;re Told (Milgram&#x27;s 37)&quot; (from &quot;Forgive Us Our Debts&quot; and &quot;Deliver Us from Evil&quot;) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; (from &quot;Redemption in Blood&quot;). With seven songs used total, Gabriel had the most music featured by a solo artist in the series, and he is the only artist to have had a song used in four of Vice&#x27;s five seasons. Five of the nine tracks on his most popular album &quot;So&quot; (1986) were used in the series.

Gabriel’s song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; features twice in the teen romance drama &quot;Say Anything&quot; (1989). It is the song playing on Lloyd Dobler’s boombox as he serenades Diane, creating the film’s most iconic scene.

Gabriel&#x27;s cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot; was featured in the fourth season finale of &quot;Big Love&quot;, as well as the first season and the ending scene of &quot;Stranger Things&quot; season 3 and the ending credits of &quot;Lone Survivor&quot;. The song also features in &#x27;Children of Mars&#x27;, a 2020 episode of the web series &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot;.

A series of spoof documentaries about the fictitious rock star Brian Pern were based loosely on Gabriel.

In 2021, Northern Irish post-punk band Invaderband released their second studio album entitled &#x27;Peter Gabriel&#x27;. The sleeve was a painting of Gabriel by Luke Haines.

== Personal life ==
Gabriel has married twice and has four children. In 1971, at age 21, he married Jill Moore, daughter of Baron Philip Moore. They had two daughters, one of whom, Anna-Marie, is a filmmaker who filmed and directed Gabriel&#x27;s live DVDs &quot;Growing Up on Tour: A Family Portrait&quot; (2003), &quot;Still Growing Up: Live &amp; Unwrapped&quot; (2005) and some of his music videos. Melanie is a musician who had been a backing vocalist in her father&#x27;s band in 2002–2011. Both daughters appear in the final sequence of the video for their father&#x27;s song &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;.

Gabriel&#x27;s marriage became increasingly strained, culminating in Moore&#x27;s affair with David Lord, the co-producer of Gabriel&#x27;s fourth studio album. After the couple divorced in 1987, Gabriel fell into a period of depression and attended therapy sessions for six years.

For a time after his divorce, Gabriel lived with American actress Rosanna Arquette. In 2021, Irish singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor said that she maintained an on-and-off relationship with Gabriel in the wake of his divorce. She ended the relationship because of her frustration with his lack of commitment, which inspired her single &quot;Thank You for Hearing Me&quot;.

Gabriel married Meabh Flynn in 2002, with whom he has two sons.

Gabriel has resided in Wiltshire for many years and runs Real World Studios from Box, Wiltshire. He previously lived in the Woolley Valley near Bath, Somerset. In 2010, he joined a campaign to stop agricultural development in the valley, which had also inspired his first solo single, &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot;, in 1977.

<text>Flare Technology was a computer hardware company based in Cambridge, United Kingdom. It was founded in 1986 by Martin Brennan, Ben Cheese, and John Mathieson, former engineers at Sinclair Research.

== History ==
Flare Technology first worked for Amstrad before developing a technology-demonstrator system called Flare One. The Flare One was intended as a home computer or games console with extensive audio and video capabilities. 

Related to the &quot;Loki&quot; project they had worked on previously at Sinclair Research, which in turn was derived from the ZX Spectrum home computer, Flare One was based around a Zilog Z80B CPU (working as an 8-bit-per-pixel blitter and a video controller) and a custom 16-bit DSP chip (responsible for 8 channel sound and 3D computation), 1 MB or RAM, with a display resolution of 256 x 256 with 256 colors or 512 x 256 with 16 colors, and an expected price of £200 in 1988. 

Flare One was used in some arcade game cabinets including a line of video quiz machines produced by Bellfruit (&quot;A Question of Sport,&quot; &quot;Beeline&quot;, &quot;Every Second Counts&quot;, &quot;Inquizitor&quot;, &quot;Quizvaders&quot;  and &quot;Treble Top&quot;). The Flare One chipset was further developed into the Konix Multisystem &quot;Slipstream&quot; prototype. 

In 1989 Martin Brennan was contracted by Atari Corp. to complete and implement the chip design of the unreleased Atari Panther.

Martin Brennan and John Mathieson went on to design the Flare II, which was purchased by Atari and became Atari Jaguar.
