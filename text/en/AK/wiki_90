<doc id="57400" wikidata="Q3551" url="?curid=57400" title="Rabat">
<text>Rabat (, , ; ) is the capital city of Morocco and the country&#x27;s seventh-largest city with an urban population of approximately 580,000 (2014) and a metropolitan population of over 1.2 million. It is also the capital city of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region. Rabat is located on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg, opposite Salé, the city&#x27;s main commuter town.

Rabat was founded in the 12th century by the Almohads. After a period of growth, the city fell into a long period of decline. In the 17th century, Rabat became a haven for Barbary pirates. When the French established a protectorate over Morocco in 1912, Rabat became its administrative center. When Morocco achieved independence in 1955, Rabat became its capital.

Rabat, Temara, and Salé form a conurbation of over 1.8 million people. Rabat is one of four Imperial cities of Morocco, and its medina is listed as a World Heritage Site. It is accessible by train through the ONCF system and by plane through the nearby Rabat–Salé Airport.

== Etymology ==
The name Rabat comes from the Arabic word (&quot;a-Ribāṭ&quot;) meaning &quot;the ribat&quot;, an Islamic base or fortification. This name is short for (&quot;Ribāṭu al-Fatḥ&quot;) meaning &quot;the ribat of conquest&quot; or &quot;stronghold of victory&quot;—a title given by the Almohads when they established the city as a naval base in 1170.

== History ==
=== Ancient &quot;Sala&quot; ===
In the first millennium BC the Phoenicians founded several trading colonies along the Atlantic coast of what is now Morocco, but the existence of a Phoenician settlement in the area, called &quot;Sala&quot; or &quot;Shallat&quot;, has been debated by archeologists. By the first century BC the local inhabitants were still writing in the neo-Punic language, but the region came under the influence of Rome. It was controlled by the ancient Berber Mauretanian Kingdom until it was formally annexed by Rome in the first century BC. On the site now known as Chellah, just south of the walled city today, the Romans built a city named &quot;Sala Colonia&quot;. Excavations have revealed that older Mauretanian structures existed on the site before Roman structures were built over them. Along with Lixus, Sala Colonia was one of the two main naval outposts held by the Romans on the Atlantic coast of the &quot;Mauretania Tingitana&quot; province. The port of Sala (now disappeared) was used by commercial Roman ships as a way station on their southwestward passages to Anfa and the &quot;Insula Purpuraria&quot; (Mogador island).

Archaeological objects of Visigothic and Byzantine origin found in the area attest to the persistence of commercial or political contacts between Sala and Roman Europe, up to the establishment of a Byzantine presence in North Africa during the 7th century. However, Sala began to be abandoned in the 5th century and was mostly in ruins when the Muslim Arabs arrived in the 7th century and established Islamic influence in the region.

===Medieval Islamic period===

In the 10th century the Umayyads of Cordoba, or their Zenata Berber allies in the region, founded a ribat or fortified monastery/outpost in this area, to defend against the Barghawata Berbers who had established a Kharijite state to the south. This ribat was most likely on the same site as the current Kasbah of the Udayas, but its location has not been confirmed by historians. Around 1030, a new town called Salā (the present Salé) was founded on the opposite side of the river (the north side) by the Banu &#x27;Ashara family.

One of the last Almoravid emirs, Tashfin ibn Ali (r. 1143–1145) built a new &quot;ribat&quot; on the site of the current kasbah as part of his efforts to hold back the Almohads. Almohads nonetheless defeated the Almoravids and destroyed the ribat shortly after. In 1150 or 1151 the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu&#x27;min built a new kasbah (citadel) to replace the former &quot;ribat&quot;, within which he included a palace and a mosque. This Almohad kasbah corresponds to the current Kasbah of the Udayas (which was expanded in later periods). Abd al-Mu&#x27;min also had an underground canal dug to divert a water source to this location, allowing for future settlement and urbanization in the area. The site became a military staging ground for Almohad armies setting out on campaigns to Al-Andalus.

The Almohad caliph Abu Yusuf Ya&#x27;qub al-Mansur (r. 1184–1199) embarked on an ambitious project to construct a new fortified imperial capital, called &quot;al-Mahdiyya&quot; or &quot;Ribat al-Fath&quot;, on the site of what is now the medina (old city) of Rabat, with new walls extending over a vast area beyond the kasbah. This project also included the construction of an enormous mosque (the remains of which include the Hassan Tower) and of new grand gateways such as &quot;Bab er-Rouah&quot; and the main gate of the kasbah, now known as &quot;Bab Udaya&quot; or &quot;Bab al-Kbir&quot;. After al-Mansur&#x27;s death in 1199 the mosque and the capital remained unfinished and his successors lacked the resources or the will to finish it. The new city was never fully inhabited and the site was practically abandoned.

During the Marinid dynasty period (13th to 15th centuries), the town of Salé across the river grew more important than the settlements of the south bank. In 1515 Leo Africanus reported that Rabat had declined so much that only 100 inhabited houses remained. The Marinids did build a Great Mosque in what is now the medina of Rabat and on the nearby site of Chellah (ancient Sala) they built a royal necropolis for their dynasty.

===Corsair republic===
In 1609, Philip III decreed the expulsion of all Moriscos (people of Muslim or Moorish descent) from Spain. About 2000 of these refugees, originally from the town of Hornachos near Badajoz, Spain, settled around Salé and occupied the kasbah, attracting between 5000 and 14,000 other Moriscos to join them. Rabat and neighboring Salé united to form the Republic of Bou Regreg in 1627. This autonomous republic became a base for corsairs: pirates, also known as the &quot;Salé Rovers&quot;, who preyed on merchant ships around the shores of Western Europe. 
During this time, the area below the kasbah on the south bank became more heavily populated, thanks to the Morisco and Andalusi refugees. A new &quot;Andalusian Wall&quot; was built to delimit this area in the northern part of the former Almohad walled city. What is now known as the Street of the Consuls became an important road artery even at this time. The name &quot;Rabat&quot; was not yet in use; the city of the south bank was known as &quot;New Salé&quot; while the city of the north bank was known as &quot;Old Salé&quot;. Corsair activities were based in New Salé, whereas the inhabitants of Old Salé generally did not participate in piracy.

=== &#x27;Alawi rule ===
The pirates did not have to contend with any central authority until al-Rashid, the founder of the &#x27;Alawi dynasty, conquered the area in 1666 and united most of Morocco under his rule. Nonetheless, the &#x27;Alawi sultans allowed the piracy to continue up until the reign of Moulay Slimane in the early 19th century. This led to the shelling of the city by Austria in 1829 after an Austrian ship had been lost to a pirate attack.

During the early part of the &#x27;Alawi period (17th–18th centuries), the sultans took some interest in the city of the south bank and carried out constructions and repairs to the kasbah. Moulay Isma&#x27;il (r. 1672–1727) expanded the kasbah southward and built a royal residence within it towards the end of the 17th century (it serves as a museum today). Moulay Isma&#x27;il was also responsible for settling a part of the Udayas (or Oudayas), a &quot;guich&quot; tribe (military tribe serving the sultan&#x27;s army), in the kasbah to serve as a counterbalancing force against other unruly tribes in the region. Under Sidi Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abdallah (r. 1757–1790), a new royal palace, the Dar al-Makhzen, was established in the southwest part of the Almohad walled area towards the end of the 18th century. These additions began to give the city the character and function of a royal residence used by the ruling dynasty outside their main capitals.

Moulay Slimane (r. 1792–1822) built another palace along the seaside called &quot;Dar al-Bahr&quot; and built new mosques such as the Moulay Slimane Mosque. He also ordered the creation of a Jewish quarter, the &quot;Mellah&quot;, in the eastern part of the Andalusian medina, in a formerly occupied by orchards. It was also towards the beginning of the 19th century that the city walls, formerly limited to the Almohad-era perimeter, were extended significantly to the southwest, thus expanding the city to cover around 840 hectares. The old Almohad walls and gates were still retained and the Almohad-era enclosure remained a more privileged district containing the city&#x27;s major monuments and its imperial residence. Most of the population remained concentrated in the medina behind the Andalusian Wall in the northern section. In the 1850s, Moulay Abd ar-Rahman (r. 1822–1859) further developed and completed the Dar al-Makhzen palace in the southwest corner of this enclosure. At the end of the 19th century or beginning of the 20th century, the city had some 20,000 to 25,000 inhabitants.

===20th century===

====French colonial rule====

The French invasion of Morocco began in the east with General Hubert Lyautey&#x27;s occupation of Oujda in March 1907 and in the west with the Bombardment of Casablanca in August 1907. The Treaty of Fes established the protectorate in March 1912. Acting as French administrator of Morocco, Lyautey decided to relocate the country&#x27;s capital from Fes to Rabat after the riots of 1912 following the Treaty of Fes. Lyautey appears to have had a personal affinity for Rabat. He argued that its coastal location was more pleasant and more accessible, and that its proximity to Casablanca, which he estimated would become the major economic center, would be advantageous. In 1913, Lyautey hired Henri Prost to design the &quot;Ville Nouvelle&quot; (Rabat&#x27;s modern quarter) as an administrative sector, as he did in other major Moroccan cities.

The colonial period resulted in major economic changes as well as accelerated urbanization. Prior to this period, the major cities of Morocco had always been Fez and Marrakesh, while the coastal cities were relatively small. Census figures are not available for the early years of the Protectorate, but in 1912 Rabat and nearby Salé can be estimated to have had about 35,000 to 40,000 inhabitants at most, according to Janet Abu-Lughod. One early French survey, based on the number of houses rather than a formal census, estimated the population of Rabat to be 25,642. A formal census in 1921 counted the population as 33,714. Some of this growth was due to the immigration of foreigners. In 1921, 59% of the population were Moroccan Muslims and 10% were Moroccan Jews, while 21.4% were French nationals and another 10% were foreigners of other origin. Nearby Salé, however, remained more homogenously Moroccan. Rabat&#x27;s population grew to approximately 83,000 in 1936 and to approximately 156,000 in 1952.

====Post World War II and independence====
When Morocco achieved independence in 1956, Mohammed V, the then King of Morocco, chose to have the capital remain at Rabat. Rabat&#x27;s growth continued unabated. The most important demographic shift after independence was the exodus of foreign nationals and their replacement by Moroccans, who gradually took over the jobs and functions that the foreigners had occupied. In the census of 1971, the population of Rabat had grown to around 368,000, of which only 3.5% were foreigners.

Following World War II, the United States had established a military presence in Rabat at the former French air base. By the early 1950s, Rabat Salé Air Base was a U.S. Air Force installation hosting the 17th Air Force and the 5th Air Division, which oversaw forward basing for Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-47 Stratojet aircraft in the country. With the destabilization of French government in Morocco, and Moroccan independence in 1956, the government of Mohammed V wanted the U.S. Air Force to pull out of the SAC bases in Morocco, insisting on such action after American intervention in Lebanon in 1958. The United States agreed to leave as of December 1959, and was fully out of Morocco by 1963. SAC felt the Moroccan bases were much less critical with the long range capability of the B-52 Stratofortresses that were replacing the B-47s and with the completion of the USAF installations in Spain in 1959. With the USAF withdrawal from Rabat-Salé in the 1960s, the facility became a primary facility for the Royal Moroccan Air Force known as Air Base Nº 1, a status it continues to hold.

The fifth Arab League summit took place in Rabat in 1969 to discuss the arson of Al-Aqsa Mosque by Australian citizen Denis Michael Rohan. In the same year, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an organization that aims to protect the interests of the Muslim world, was founded at a summit in Rabat. The 1974 Arab League summit was also held in Rabat. The summit recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. In 1985, the sixth edition of the Pan Arab Games was held in Rabat.

In 2015, the city became part of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region. On 28 February 2024, Asmaa Rhlalou declared her resignation, months after she sparked a controversy that called into doubt her authority and validity within the City Council.

==Geography==

===Neighbourhoods of Rabat===
Rabat is an administrative city. It has many shopping districts and residential neighbourhoods. The geographically spread out neighbourhoods are as follows:

The heart of the city consists of three parts: the Medina (old town); the Oudayas and Hassan both located to meet the Bou Regreg; and the Atlantic Ocean.

To the west, and along the waterfront, there is a succession of neighbourhoods.

First, around the ramparts, there is the old neighbourhoods, Quartier l&#x27;Océan and Quartier les Orangers. Beyond that, a succession of mostly working-class districts: Diour Jamaa, Akkari, Yacoub El Mansour, Massira and Hay el Fath are the main parts of this axis. Hay el Fath, which ends this sequence, evolves into a middle-class neighbourhood.

To the east, along the Bouregreg, the Youssoufia region (working and middle class) : Mabella; Taqaddoum; Hay Nahda (mostly middle class); Aviation (middle and upper middle class); and Rommani.

Between the two axes, from north to south, there are three main neighbourhoods (middle class to affluent): Agdal (Ward Building; a lively mix of residential and commercial buildings. The residents are predominantly upper middle class); Hay Riad (affluent villas; this neighbourhood has experienced a surge of momentum since the 2000s); and Souissi (lavish villas, embassies, well-off residential neighborhood).

On the outskirts of Souissi, are a number of less-dense regions mainly comprising large private houses to areas that seem out of the city.
===Subdivisions===
The prefecture is divided administratively into the following:

===Climate===

Rabat features a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) with warm to hot, dry summers and mild, damp winters. Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Rabat has a mild, temperate climate, shifting from cool in winter to warm days in the summer months. The nights are always cool (or cold in winter, it can reach sub sometimes), with daytime temperatures generally rising about . The winter highs typically reach only in December–February. Summer daytime highs usually hover around , but may occasionally exceed during heat waves. Summer nights are usually pleasant and cool, ranging between and rarely exceeding . Rabat belongs to the sub-humid bioclimatic zone with an average annual precipitation of . The airport station is located about from the coastline, which will somewhat warm afternoons and cool nights down compared to a seaside location.

== Culture ==
The biggest place for theatre is the Mohammed V Theatre in the centre of the town, which was opened in 1962. Construction on a new performing arts center, the Grand Theatre of Rabat, began in 2014. Designed by Zaha Hadid, it will reportedly be the largest theater in the Arab world and in Africa. It was scheduled to open in 2021.

Many organizations are active in cultural and social issues. Orient-Occident Foundation and ONA Foundation are the biggest of these. An independent art scene is active in the city. L&#x27;appartement 22, which is the first independent space for visual arts created by Abdellah Karroum, opened in 2002 and introduced international and local artists. Other independent spaces opened few years after, such as Le Cube, also set up in a private space.

===Mawazine===
Mawazine is a music festival in Rabat organized under the auspices of King Mohammed VI of Morocco, that started in 2001 where music groups, fans and spectators come together in a week-long celebration of culture and music both locally and internationally. Musicians such as Scorpions, The Weeknd, Jennifer Lopez, Kanye West, Pitbull, Rihanna, Elton John, Stromae and many others have performed at the festival.

Mawazine was host to more than 2,500,000 in 2013. Workshops are available for teaching dances and other arts. The festival is free. However, while most areas are free, there are those that require payment, specifically the smaller stages being the historical site of Chellah, the Mohammed V National Theater, and the Renaissance Cultural Center.

=== Places of worship ===
The places of worship are predominantly Muslim mosques. The oldest mosque in the city is the &quot;Old Mosque&quot; (&quot;Jama&#x27; al-&#x27;Atiqa&quot;) in the Kasbah of the Udayas. It was originally founded during Abd al-Mu&#x27;min&#x27;s construction of the kasbah in 1150, though its current form mostly dates from an 18th-century restoration. Other important mosques include the Great Mosque in the old medina, also known as the el-Kharrazin Mosque, and the As-Sunna Mosque in central Rabat, originally completed in 1785 by Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah.

The last remaining synagogues in Rabat are the Rabbi Shalom Zaoui synagogue and the Talmud Torah Synagogue. There are also Christian churches and temples, including an Evangelical church and St. Peter&#x27;s Cathedral (&quot;Cathédrale de Saint-Pierre&quot;), which hosts the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rabat.

=== Museums and parks ===

The Oudayas Museum (also formerly known as the National Museum of Jewellery) is housed in a pavilion residence built by Sultan Moulay Isma&#x27;il (r. 1672–1727) inside the Kasbah of the Udayas. It was first opened in 1915, making it one of the oldest public museums in Morocco. Its collections, augmented by private donations, feature diverse objects from throughout Morocco, mostly from the 18th to 20th centuries. In 2006 it became the National Museum of Jewellery, with exhibits focusing on the history of Moroccan jewellery. As of 2019 it was under renovations to be transformed into a new museum to be called &quot;Musée du caftan et de la parure&quot; (&#x27;Museum of the caftan and adornment&#x27;).

The Museum of History and Civilizations (formerly the National Archeological Museum) showcases the history of Morocco through a collection of archeological artifacts from the Punic, Mauretanian, Roman, and Islamic periods. This includes a collection of ancient Roman bronze and marble statuary from sites such as Lixus, Volubilis, and Chellah, as well as coins, ceramics, and architectural fragments from the Islamic period.

The Rabat Zoo (officially called the Zoological Garden of Rabat) was opened in 1973, in part to house the lions that were previously kept at the Royal Palace. The lions are descended from the now-extinct Barbary lions. Since then the zoo has expanded to house some 1800 animals and has engaged in conservation efforts.

The Bank al-Maghrib Museum was inaugurated in 2002 and is housed at the Bank al-Maghrib building downtown. Its main exhibits include a collection of coins and currency from ancient times to the modern era, as well as a gallery of Orientialist art. The Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art was inaugurated in 2014.

=== Historic monuments ===
The Kasbah of the Udayas (also spelled &quot;Kasbah of the Oudaias&quot;) is the oldest part of the present-day city, built by the Almohads in the 12th century. It was later refortified and expanded by the corsairs and the &#x27;Alawi dynasty in the 17th and 18th centuries. The kasbah is now a residential district with traditional houses painted white and blue on the outside. Its southern section includes the &quot;Andalusian Garden&quot;, landscaped in the 20th century.

The city&#x27;s historic walls were first built by the Almohad caliph Ya&#x27;qub al-Mansur and completed in 1197, with later additions in the 17th and 19th centuries. A number of monumental gates are found along the walls, the most notable being Bab er-Rouah. The other Almohad-era gates are Bab el-Had, Bab al-Alou, Bab Zaers, and Bab al-Hadid, though many of them were modified in more recent periods. The 17th-century Andalusian Wall, which divides the zone inside the Almohad walls, has five more gates: Bab Jdid (formerly Bab Teben, mostly demolished), Bab al-Bouiba, Bab Chellah, Bab Mellah, and Bab Diouana.

The old medina, located below the kasbah and above the line of the Andalusian Wall, contains many historic mosques and traditional houses. The rest of the area within the Almohad walls but south of the Andalusian Wall was largely built up in the 20th century when Rabat became the capital during the French Protectorate. These districts contain numerous public buildings and apartment blocs built in contemporary styles of that period, such as neo-Moorish (known as &quot;néo-Mauresque&quot; or &quot;arabisant&quot; in French), Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and modern architecture. Examples of these include the Bank al-Maghrib building (built in the 1920s), the Central Post Office building (circa 1921, expanded in 1930s), the Parliament building (built in the 1920s), St.-Peter&#x27;s Cathedral (inaugurated in 1921, with later additions), the Rabat-Ville train station (early 1920s), and some of the apartment blocs on &quot;Rue Gaza&quot; (built or begun in the 1930s), among others.

Overlooking the shores of the river is the Hassan Tower, a monumental unfinished minaret constructed by Ya&#x27;qub al-Mansur in the late 12th century. It was built for an enormous mosque planned as part of the larger city al-Mansur was constructing. Across from the tower today, at the southern end of the mosque&#x27;s remains, is the Mausoleum of Mohammed V (d. 1961), which houses the remains of King Mohammed V and King Hassan II. The mausoleum, completed in 1971, was designed in a neo-Moorish or Moroccan revivalist style by Vietnamese architect Cong Vo Toan.

A short distance south of the historic city walls is the archeological site of Chellah, a walled enclosure containing a 13th to 14th-century Marinid funerary and religious complex as well as the ruins of the Roman city of Sala Colonia. Across the river is the city of Salé, which also preserves a historic medina. The medina of Salé includes monuments from the Marinid period such as Bab Mrissa and the Madrasa of Abu al-Hasan as well as landmarks from later periods.

<text>Roseau (Dominican Creole: &quot;Wozo&quot;) is the capital and largest city of Dominica, with a population of 14,725 as of 2011. It is a small and compact urban settlement, in the Saint George parish and surrounded by the Caribbean Sea, the Roseau River and Morne Bruce. Built on the site of the ancient Island Carib village of Sairi, it is the oldest and most important urban settlement on the island of Dominica.

It is on the west (leeward) coast of Dominica and has a combination of modern and colonial French architecture.

Roseau is Dominica&#x27;s most important port for foreign trade. Some exports include bananas, bay oil, vegetables, grapefruit, oranges, and cocoa. The service sector is also a large part of the local economy. There are several private institutions registered in Dominica, like Ross University, International University for Graduate Studies, All Saints University, New World University, and Western Orthodox University.

There is a prominent diocese called Roman Catholic Diocese of Roseau.

==History==

The city of Roseau sits on an alluvial fan formed hundreds of years ago as the Roseau River meandered across the area from what is now known as Newtown to its current location. Over the last 2,000 years, Amerindians migrating through the islands settled the area attracted by the nearby river. With the arrival of the Europeans in the 16th and 17th centuries, a small settlement was established by the French who, in their tradition of naming places after what they found there, used their name for the river reeds that grew along the banks. A plan was created for the settlement that mirrored examples in France where streets extended from a central point – what is today the Old Market – and spread out to the rest of the settlement.

Conflict raged between the French and the British over the area on several occasions. In 1699, the French built a fort to protect Roseau. In 1770, the British built Fort Young in place of the previous fort. In 1778, the French invaded Dominica, capturing Fort Young and Roseau and taking control of the island. In 1784, Dominica was returned to British control under the Treaty of Paris. 

By the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the British set out plans for the city that included fortifications and government structures, the grid street system, and blocks and new urban areas to the north and south, known today as Potter&#x27;s Ville and Newtown. Goodwill was established in the 1950s and Bath Estate in the early 1980s. Since then several new semi-urban settlements – such as Stock Farm, Castle Comfort, and Wall House – have been constructed around the existing ones. Some older settlements like Fond Cole and Canefield nowadays belong to the semi-urban area around Roseau.

The French influence can still be seen today, however, in its architecture and crooked streets that extend from the Old Market Plaza. Examples of the English influence are evident in architecture and street names.

==Climate and scenery==

Roseau&#x27;s nearby scenery (mostly in its so-called valley) includes Boiling Lake, east, in the Morne Trois Pitons National Park, waterfalls, thermal springs, and scenic plateaus.

Morne Bruce provides panoramic views of most of downtown Roseau and north toward Woodbridge Bay deepwater port and Fond Cole. From Morne Bruce there are views of the Botanic Gardens at its base as well as the Caribbean Sea which look quite spectacular when cruise liners are in port.

Roseau&#x27;s climate is a tropical monsoon climate, featuring relatively constant temperatures throughout the year with average high temperatures generally between and average low temperatures between . Rainfall is common throughout the year, with the city seeing an annual average nearly . Roseau features a noticeably drier stretch from February through April, though each of these months on average sees at least of rain.
==Architecture==
The central district of Roseau is tightly packed with small and large houses and even larger modern concrete structures. There is little green or open space in the city; there is even less today, as many of the courtyards that were once commonplace are giving way to office space. The district is, however, framed in every direction by natural elements. The sea and the river provide water elements while the Botanical gardens and the Government House gardens frame the city with green space. These elements are rare in the Caribbean. No other centre in the region has such extensive botanical gardens with such central location, and the Roseau River is among the largest that flow through any Caribbean capital.

The urban structure of Central Roseau is based on an irregular grid system of miniature proportions, making it a highly illegible city. Even though the grid area is not extensive, it is relatively easy for a visitor to get lost. The grid area has some 80 blocks in an area of . In comparison, the grid areas of Kingstown and Castries — capitals of Saint Vincent and Saint Lucia — have some 50 and 60 blocks in the areas of over . The average block size in Central Roseau is thus some ⅓ hectare (1 acre), i.e., about half of the figure of Central Kingstown.

There are some fine examples of West Indian architecture in Roseau. The ones that stand out the most are the French Colonial style and the vernacular form. Much of the French influence can be found along King George V Street. Around the city there are good examples of the English influence in large colonial town houses and colonial public/government buildings.

The churches in Roseau are fine examples of Europe in Dominica with a bit of creolization. The Roman Catholic Cathedral stands prominent in Gothic Romanesque revival and the Anglican Church on Victoria Street in Georgian style.

==City life==

Because of the suburban sprawl, few people live in Central Roseau, but more of them commute daily. Motorized vehicles pour into the central district introducing a mode of point-to-point interaction in an environment that was created for multiple use. As elders said, first there were no streets but just a space between the buildings. The streets of Roseau, and especially those of its central district, are not only ways to move from place to place but they are places themselves. They are used as gardens, playing fields, and social meeting places.

The Botanical Gardens on the fringes of the central district are mostly used by children.

==Sports and recreation==
In Roseau, there are many opportunities for recreation. Many people seek the tranquility and cool of the Botanical Gardens as a getaway on Sunday afternoons and at lunch. It is a popular venue for local cricket matches and sports training. Football is popular; there are several pitches throughout the city (at Newtown, Potters Ville, and Bath Estate), as well as in the sports stadium at Windsor Park.

===Sporting facilities and infrastructure===
There are dedicated sports facilities around the city. Private tennis courts are on High Street; netball and basketball courts abound in the major high schools. These are complemented by community facilities at Goodwill. A dedicated netball and basketball stadium is at Stockfarm near the Dominica State College.

In 2007, Windsor Park, a cricket stadium which is also home to the Dominica national football team, was completed with a donation of EC$33 million from the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Elsewhere it is not uncommon to find that a section of the street, sidewalk or the beach has been adapted for makeshift games of cricket or football.

Other popular sports include netball, basketball, rounders and (to a much lesser extent) tennis.

==Accommodations and infrastructure==
There are no world-famous hotel chains in the city. The most famous is the Fort Young Hotel. In addition there are several small family owned establishments in and on the outskirts of Roseau.

Dominica Broadcasting Corporation, the national radio station, and two private radio stations are in the capital.

==Non-governmental organizations==
Roseau is home to service clubs including, Kiwanis, Rotary and Lions. There are other organizations such as the local humane society and conservation society. ChildFund International USA has an office in Roseau from where it runs its child centered development programs for Dominica and Saint Vincent.

The Dominica Association of Industry and Commerce, Waitukubuli Ecological Foundation, Dominica Tourism Association and others are based in the city.

The city is home to several labour organizations including the Dominica Amalgamated Workers&#x27; Union, the Dominica Public Service Union, the Dominica Trade Union, the National Workers&#x27; Union and the Waterfront and Allied Workers&#x27; Union.

==Transportation==
As the most important town on the island and hub of all business activity, the city is a central point of the road networks on the island. It is an important link between northern, eastern, and southern bound traffic.

Roseau is served by Canefield Airport, a nearby small aircraft airport that provides direct links to nearby islands, as well as the larger Douglas–Charles Airport to the north. The ferry terminal provides direct links to the neighbouring Guadeloupe to the north and Martinique and St. Lucia to the south.

There are no rail or subway systems.

==Education==
Roseau has been the historical centre of education on the island. There are six secondary schools in the city as well as eight primary schools. A community college, the Dominica State College, is in Roseau. There are two private medical schools, All Saints School of Medicine and Ross University School of Medicine, and a private university, Western Orthodox University.

==Embassies and consulates==

Several embassies are in the city. They include the Brazilian, the Chinese, the Cuban, and the Venezuelan embassies, with a couple of other consulates around the city.

<doc id="57404" wikidata="Q37995" url="?curid=57404" title="Yangon">
<text>Yangon, formerly romanized as Rangoon, is the capital of the Yangon Region and the largest city of Myanmar. Yangon was the capital of Myanmar until 2005 and served as such until 2006, when the military government relocated the administrative functions to the purpose-built capital city of Naypyidaw in north central Myanmar. With over five million people, Yangon is Myanmar&#x27;s most populous city and its most important commercial centre.

Yangon boasts the largest number of colonial-era buildings in Southeast Asia, and has a unique colonial-era urban core that is remarkably intact. The colonial-era commercial core is centered around the Sule Pagoda, which is reputed to be over 2,000 years old. The city is also home to the gilded Shwedagon Pagoda – Myanmar&#x27;s most sacred and famous Buddhist pagoda.

Yangon suffers from deeply inadequate infrastructure, especially compared to other major cities in Southeast Asia, such as Jakarta, Bangkok or Hanoi. Though many historic residential and commercial buildings have been renovated throughout central Yangon, most satellite towns that ring the city continue to be profoundly impoverished and lack basic infrastructure.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The name &quot;Yangon&quot; () is derived from the combination of the Burmese words () and (), which mean &#x27;enemies&#x27; and &#x27;run out of&#x27;, respectively. This word combination can be translated as &#x27;End of Strife&#x27;.

The name is pronounced in British English and in American English.

The former romanization, &quot;Rangoon&quot;, was based on the Rakhine dialect, and pronounced in English.

==History==

===Early history===
Yangon was founded as &quot;Dagon&quot; in the early 11th century () by the Mon people, who inhabited Lower Burma at that time. Dagon became an important pilgrimage pagoda town, starting in the 14th century, during the Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Notable governors of Dagon included Princess Maha Dewi, who ruled the town from 1364 to 1392, and her grandniece, Shin Saw Pu, who later became the only female queen regnant in Burmese history. Queen Saw Pu built a palace next to the Shwedagon Pagoda in the town in 1460 and spent her semi-retired life at that palace until her death in 1471.

In 1755, King Alaungpaya, the founder of the Konbaung dynasty captured Dagon, added settlements around it, and called the enlarged town &quot;Yangon&quot;. In the 1790s, the East India Company opened a factory in Yangon. The estimated population of Yangon in 1823 was about 30,000. The British captured Yangon during the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–26), but returned the city to Burmese rule after the war. The city was destroyed by a fire in 1841.

=== Colonial Rangoon (1852–1948) ===

The British captured Yangon and all of Lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, and subsequently transformed Yangon into the commercial and political hub of British Burma. After the war, the British moved the capital of British Burma from Moulmein (present-day Mawlamyine) to Yangon. Based on the design by army engineer Lt. Alexander Fraser, the British constructed a new city on a grid plan on delta land, bounded to the east by the Pazundaung Creek and to the south and west by the Yangon River. Yangon became the capital of all British-ruled Burma after the British had captured Upper Burma in the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885. By the 1890s Yangon&#x27;s increasing population and commerce gave birth to prosperous residential suburbs to the north of Royal Lake (Kandawgyi) and Inya Lake. The British also established hospitals including Rangoon General Hospital and colleges including Rangoon University.

After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British sent Bahadur Shah II, the last Mughal emperor, to Yangon to live in exile.

Colonial Yangon, with its spacious parks and lakes and mix of modern buildings and traditional wooden architecture, was known as &quot;the garden city of the East&quot;. By the early 20th century, Yangon had public services and infrastructure on par with London.

Before World War II, about 55% of Yangon&#x27;s population of 500,000 was Indian or South Asian, and only about a third was Bamar (Burman). Karens, Chinese, Anglo-Burmese, and others made up the rest.

After World War I, Yangon became the center of the Burmese independence movement, with leftist Rangoon University students leading the way. Three nationwide strikes against British rule in 1920, 1936, and 1938 all began in Yangon. Yangon was under Japanese occupation (1942–45), and incurred heavy damage during World War II. The city was retaken by the Allies in May 1945. Yangon became the capital of the Union of Burma on 4 January 1948 when the country gained independence from British rule.
=== Contemporary Yangon (1948–present) ===
Soon after Burma&#x27;s independence in 1948, many colonial-era names of streets and parks were changed to more nationalistic Burmese names. In 1989, the military junta changed the city&#x27;s English name to &quot;Yangon&quot;, along with many other changes in English transliteration of Burmese names. (The changes have not been accepted by many Burmese who consider the junta unfit to make such changes, nor by many publications and news bureaus, including, most notably, the BBC and foreign nations including the United Kingdom and the United States.)

Since independence, Yangon has expanded outwards. Successive governments have built satellite towns such as Thaketa, North Okkalapa and South Okkalapa in the 1950s to Hlaingthaya, Shwepyitha and South Dagon in the 1980s. Today, Greater Yangon encompasses an area covering nearly .

During Ne Win&#x27;s isolationist rule (1962–88), Yangon&#x27;s infrastructure deteriorated through poor maintenance and did not keep up with its increasing population. In the 1990s, the military government&#x27;s more open market policies attracted domestic and foreign investment, bringing a modicum of modernity to the city&#x27;s infrastructure. Some inner city residents were forcibly relocated to new satellite towns. Many colonial-period buildings were demolished to make way for high-rise hotels, office buildings, and shopping malls, leading the city government to place about 200 notable colonial-period buildings under the Yangon City Heritage List in 1996. Major building programs have resulted in six new bridges and five new highways linking the city to its industrial back country. Still, much of Yangon remains without basic municipal services such as 24-hour electricity and regular garbage collection.

Yangon has become much more indigenous Burmese in its ethnic make-up since independence. After independence, many South Asians and Anglo-Burmese left. Many more South Asians were forced to leave during the 1960s by Ne Win&#x27;s xenophobic government. Nevertheless, sizeable South Asian and Chinese communities still exist in Yangon. The Anglo-Burmese have effectively disappeared, having left the country or intermarried with other Burmese groups.

Yangon was the centre of major anti-government protests in 1974, 1988 and 2007. In particular, the 8888 Uprising resulted in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of Burmese civilians, many of them in Yangoon where hundreds of thousands of people flooded into the streets of the former capital city. The Saffron Revolution saw mass shootings and the use of crematoria in Yangoon by the Burmese government to erase evidence of their crimes against monks, unarmed protesters, journalists and students.

The city&#x27;s streets saw bloodshed each time as protesters were gunned down by the government, most notably during the 1988, 2007, and the 2021 mass protests, all of which were started in Yangon itself, signifying its importance as the cultural centre of Burma.

In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis hit Yangon. While the city had few human casualties, three-quarters of Yangon&#x27;s industrial infrastructure was destroyed or damaged, with losses estimated at US$800 million.

In November 2005, the military government designated Naypyidaw, north of Yangon, as the new administrative capital, and moved much of the government to the newly developed city. Yangon remains the largest city and the most important commercial, economic and cultural center of Myanmar. On 7 May 2005, a series of coordinated bombings occurred in the city of Yangon, Myanmar. Eleven people were killed in the attack, and one of the 162 people that were injured was a member of the LCMS mission team to Myanmar.

In the 2020s, life in Yangon was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and 2021 coup d&#x27;état. The city was the location of mass protests in response to the coup. The femboy population in Yangon also increased due to the Spring Revolution of Myanmar, protesting against the ruling military junta who took control after the 2021 coup d&#x27;état. In protest, femboy outfits were used to gain exposure, with gender-nonconforming outfits being worn by non-femboy protestors. Aye Lei Tun credits the femboy culture as tactic to lead towards &quot;social and cultural revolution&quot; The pandemic and protests prompted authorities to enforce numerous lockdowns and curfews. The city&#x27;s economy subsequently slowed. 

==Geography==
Yangon is located in Lower Burma (Myanmar) at the convergence of the Yangon and Bago Rivers about 30 km (19 mi) away from the Gulf of Martaban at 16°48&#x27; North, 96°09&#x27; East (16.8, 96.15). Its standard time zone is UTC/GMT +6:30 hours.
23 meters above sea level. Due to its location on the Irrawaddy Delta, intertidal flat ecosystems occur adjacent to the city.

===Climate===
Yangon has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the Köppen climate classification system. The city features a lengthy wet season from May through October where a substantial amount of rainfall is received; and a dry season from November through April, where little rainfall is seen. It is primarily due to the heavy rainfall received during the rainy season that makes Yangon fall under the tropical monsoon climate category. During the course of year 1961 to 1990s, average temperatures show little variance, with average highs ranging from and average lows ranging from .

Yangon is prone to tropical cyclones every time of the year. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis made landfall as a Category 4 cyclone, making it the worst cyclone on the country&#x27;s record.
==Cityscape==

Until the mid-1990s, Yangon remained largely constrained to its traditional peninsula setting between the Bago, Yangon, and Hlaing Rivers. People moved in, but little of the city moved out. Maps from 1944 show little development north of Inya Lake and areas that are now layered in cement and stacked with houses were then virtual backwaters. Since the late 1980s, however, the city began a rapid spread north to where Yangon International Airport now stands. But the result is a stretching tail on the city, with the downtown area well removed from its geographic centre. The city&#x27;s area has steadily increased from in 1901 to in 1940 to in 1974, to in 1985, and to in 2008.

===Architecture===

Downtown Yangon is known for its leafy avenues and fin-de-siècle architecture. The former British colonial capital has the highest number of colonial period buildings in south-east Asia. Downtown Yangon is still mainly made up of decaying colonial buildings. The former High Court, the former Secretariat buildings, the former St. Paul&#x27;s English High School and the Strand Hotel are excellent examples of the bygone era. Most downtown buildings from this era are four-story mix-use (residential and commercial) buildings with ceilings, allowing for the construction of mezzanines. Despite their less-than-perfect conditions, the buildings remain highly sought after and most expensive in the city&#x27;s property market.

In 1996, the Yangon City Development Committee created a Yangon City Heritage List of old buildings and structures in the city that cannot be modified or torn down without approval. In 2012, the city of Yangon imposed a 50-year moratorium on demolition of buildings older than 50 years. The Yangon Heritage Trust, an NGO started by Thant Myint-U, aims to create heritage areas in Downtown, and attract investors to renovate buildings for commercial use.

A latter-day hallmark of Yangon is the eight-story apartment building. (In Yangon parlance, a building with no elevators (lifts) is called an apartment building and one with elevators is called a condominium. Condos which have to invest in a local power generator to ensure 24-hour electricity for the elevators are beyond the reach of most Yangonites.) Found throughout the city, eight-story apartment buildings provide inexpensive housing for many Yangonites. The apartments are usually eight stories high (including the ground floor) mainly because city regulations, until February 2008, required that all buildings higher than or eight stories to install lifts. The code calls for elevators in buildings higher than or six stories, likely ushering in the era of the six-story apartment building. Although most apartment buildings were built only within the last 20 years, they look much older and rundown due to shoddy construction and lack of proper maintenance.

Unlike other major Asian cities, Yangon does not have any skyscrapers. This is due to rule that no building should be more than 75% the height above sea level of Shwedagon Pagoda, which rises about . For instance, in 2015, a luxury housing project was cancelled due to its proximity to Shwedagon Pagoda. Critics of the project claimed that the project could cause structural damage to the pagoda. Aside from a few high-rise hotels and office towers, most high-rise buildings (usually 10 stories and up) are &quot;condos&quot; scattered across prosperous neighborhoods north of downtown such as Bahan, Dagon, Kamayut and Mayangon.

Older satellite towns such as Thaketa, North Okkalapa, and South Okkalapa are lined mostly with one to two-story detached houses with access to the city&#x27;s electricity grid. Newer satellite towns such as North Dagon and South Dagon are in a grid layout. The satellite towns—old or new—receive little or no municipal services.

===Road layout===

Downtown Yangon&#x27;s road layout follows a grid pattern, based on four types of roads:
* Broad 49-m wide roads running west to east
* Broad 30-m wide roads running south to north
* Two narrow 9.1-m wide streets running south to north
* Mid-size 15-m wide streets running south to north

The east–west grid of central was laid out by British military engineers Fraser and Montgomerie after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The city was later developed by the Public Works Department and Bengal Corps of Engineers. The pattern of south to north roads is as follows: one broad wide road, two narrow streets, one mid-size street, two more narrow streets, and then another broad wide road. This order is repeated from west to east. The narrow streets are numbered; the medium and broad roads are named.

For example, the Lanmadaw Road is followed by -wide 17th and 18th streets then the medium Sint-Oh-Dan Road, the 30-foot 19th and 20th streets, followed by another wide Latha Road, followed again by the two numbered small roads 21st and 22nd streets, and so on.

The roads running parallel west to east were the Strand Road, Merchant Road, Maha Bandula (née Dalhousie) Road, Anawrahta (Fraser) Road, and Bogyoke Aung San (Montgomerie) Road.
===Parks and gardens===
The largest and best maintained parks in Yangon are located around Shwedagon Pagoda. To the south-east of the gilded stupa is the most popular recreational area in the city – Kandawgyi Lake. The 150-acre (61-ha) lake is surrounded by the 110-acre (45-ha) Kandawgyi Nature Park, and the 69.25-acre (28-ha) Yangon Zoological Gardens, which consists of a zoo, an aquarium and an amusement park. West of the pagoda towards the former Hluttaw (Parliament) complex is the 130-acre (53-ha) People&#x27;s Square and Park, the former parading ground on important national days when Yangon was the capital. A few miles north of the pagoda lies the 37-acre (15-ha) Inya Lake Park – a favourite hangout place of Yangon University students, and a well-known place of romance in Burmese popular culture.

Hlawga National Park and Allied War Memorial at the outskirts of the city are popular day-trip destinations with tourists.

==Administration==
Yangon is administered by the Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC). YCDC also coordinates urban planning. The city is made up of 33 townships and is part of Yangon Region. Yangon Region is divided into four districts, which overlap with the city&#x27;s jurisdiction. The current mayor of Yangon is Maung Maung Soe. Each township is administered by a Township Development Committee, alongside local leaders who make decisions regarding city beautification and infrastructure. &quot;Myo-thit&quot; (lit. &quot;New Towns&quot;, or satellite towns) are not within such jurisdictions.

Yangon is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21.

==Transport==
Yangon is Burma&#x27;s main domestic and international hub for air, rail, and ground transportation.

===Air===
Yangon International Airport, located 12 miles (19 km) from downtown, is the country&#x27;s main gateway for domestic and international air travel. The airport has three terminals, known as T1, T2 and T3 which is also known as Domestic. It has direct flights to major cities in Asia, such as Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Kolkata, and Dubai. Although domestic airlines offer service to about forty domestic locations, most flights are to tourist destinations such as Bagan, Mandalay, Heho and Ngapali, and to the capital Naypyidaw.

===Railways===

Yangon Central Railway Station is the main terminus of Myanmar Railways&#x27; rail network whose reach covers Upper Myanmar (Naypyidaw, Mandalay, Shwebo), upcountry (Myitkyina), Shan hills (Taunggyi, Lashio) and the Taninthayi coast (Mawlamyine, Dawei).

Yangon Circular Railway operates a 39-station commuter rail network that connects Yangon&#x27;s satellite towns. The system is heavily used by the local populace, selling about 150,000 tickets daily. The popularity of the commuter line has jumped since the government reduced petrol subsidies in August 2007.

In 2017 the government of Japan provided more than US$200 million in finance to assist with a range of works including developing and maintaining the Yangon circular railway line, purchasing new carriages and upgrading signalling.

===Rapid transit===
The Yangon Urban Mass Rapid Transit is a proposed rapid transit system, due to begin construction in 2022 and be complete by 2027.

===Buses and cars===

Yangon has a road network of all types (tar, concrete and dirt) in March 2011. Many of the roads are in poor condition and not wide enough to accommodate an increasing number of cars. The vast majority of Yangon residents cannot afford a car and rely on an extensive network of buses to get around. Over 300 public and private bus lines operate about 6,300 crowded buses around the city, carrying over 4.4 million passengers a day. All buses and 80% of the taxis in Yangon run on compressed natural gas (CNG), following the 2005 government decree to save money on imported petroleum. Highway buses to other cities depart from Dagon Ayeyar Highway Bus Terminal for Irrawaddy delta region and Aung Mingala Highway Bus Terminal for other parts of the country.

Motor transportation in Yangon is highly expensive for most of its citizens. As the government allows only a few thousand cars to be imported each year in a country with over 50 million people, car prices in Yangon (and in Burma) are among the highest in the world. In July 2008, the two most popular cars in Yangon, 1986/87 Nissan Sunny Super Saloon and 1988 Toyota Corolla SE Limited, cost the equivalent of about US$20,000 and US$29,000 respectively. A sports utility vehicle, imported for the equivalent of around US$50,000, goes for US$250,000. Illegally imported unregistered cars are cheaper – typically about half the price of registered cars. Nonetheless, car usage in Yangon is on the rise, a sign of rising incomes for some, and already causes much traffic congestion in highway-less Yangon&#x27;s streets. In 2011, Yangon had about 300,000 registered motor vehicles in addition to an unknown number of unregistered ones.

Within Yangon city limits, it is illegal to drive trishaws, bicycles, and motorcycles. Since February 2010, pick-up truck bus lines have been forbidden to run in six townships of central Yangon, namely Latha, Lanmadaw, Pabedan, Kyauktada, Botahtaung and Pazundaung Townships. In May 2003, a ban on using car horns was implemented in six townships of Downtown Yangon to reduce noise pollution. In April 2004, the car horn ban was expanded to cover the entire city.

On 16 January 2017, as part of public transport reforms, city bus network system Yangon Bus Service (YBS) was created by the Yangon Region Transport Authority. On 20 May 2021, YRTA was reorganized as Yangon Region Transport Committee (YRTC). YBS is claimed to be a disabled-friendly bus service and have a card payment system. Since January 2019, passengers can either pay with cash or smart cards through the machines installed near the driver seat on the bus. As of January 2022, it is claimed that card machines are installed on more than 1900 buses. Ride hailing services operated by private corporations such as Uber and Grab are also available in Yangon today.

===River===
Yangon&#x27;s four main passenger jetties, all located on or near downtown waterfront, mainly serve local ferries across the river to Dala and Thanlyin, and regional ferries to the Irrawaddy delta. The 22-mile (35 km) Twante Canal was the quickest route from Yangon to the Irrawaddy delta until the 1990s when roads between Yangon and the Irrawaddy Division became usable year-round. While passenger ferries to the delta are still used, those to Upper Burma via the Irrawaddy river are now limited mostly to tourist river cruises. In October 2017, a New Yangon Water Bus was launched.

==Demographics==
Yangon is the most populous city by far in Myanmar. According to the 2014 census, the city had a population of 5.16 million. The city&#x27;s population grew sharply after 1948 as many people (mainly, the indigenous Burmese) from other parts of the country moved into the newly built satellite towns of North Okkalapa, South Okkalapa, and Thaketa in the 1950s and East Dagon, North Dagon and South Dagon in the 1990s. Immigrants have founded their regional associations (such as Mandalay Association, Mawlamyaing Association, etc.) in Yangon for networking purposes. The government&#x27;s decision to move the nation&#x27;s administrative capital to Naypyidaw has drained an unknown number of civil servants away from Yangon.

The city&#x27;s femboy population also grew in size after the 2021 coup d&#x27;état. Femboy culture in Myanmar grew in size after Myanmar&#x27;s Spring Revolution. Protestors against the ruling military junta wore gender-nonconforming outfits the which was previously unfamiliar to Myanmar, as a tactic to lead towards a &quot;social and cultural ideological revolution&quot;. ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute described femboy activity against the junta as causing &quot;subversion of its assertion of rule&quot;, drawing comparison to opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War and the anti-war &quot;make love, not war&quot; slogan.

Yangon is the most ethnically diverse city in the country. While Indians formed the slight majority prior to World War II, today, the majority of the population is of indigenous Bamar (Burman) descent. Large communities of Indians Burmese and the Chinese Burmese exist, especially in the traditional downtown neighborhoods. A large number of Rakhine, Karen and Femboys also live in the city.

Burmese is the principal language of the city. English is by far the preferred second language of the educated class. In recent years, however, the prospect of overseas job opportunities has enticed some to study other languages: Mandarin Chinese is most popular, followed by Japanese, and French.

===Religions===
The primary religions practised in Yangon are Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Shwedagon Pagoda is a famous religious landmark in the city.

===Media===

Yangon is the country&#x27;s hub for the movie, music, advertising, newspaper, and book publishing industries, and is the country&#x27;s cultural center. All media is heavily regulated by the military government. Television broadcasting is off-limits to the private sector. All media content must first be approved by the government&#x27;s media censor board, Press Scrutiny and Registration Division.

Most television channels in the country are broadcast from Yangon. MRTV and Myawaddy TV are the two main channels, providing Burmese-language news and entertainment programs. Other special interest channels are MWD-1 and MWD-2, MITV, the English-language channel that targets overseas audiences via satellite and via internet, MRTV-4 and Channel 7 (Yangon) are with a focus on non-formal education programs and movies, and Movie 5, a pay-TV channel specializing in broadcasting foreign movies.

Yangon has three radio stations. Myanmar Radio is the national radio service and broadcasts mostly in Burmese and in English during specific times. Pop culture-oriented Yangon City FM and Mandalay City FM radio stations specialize in Burmese and English pop music, entertainment programs, live celebrity interviews, etc. New radio channels such as Shwe FM and Pyinsawaddy FM can also be tuned with the city area.

Nearly all print media and industries are based out of Yangon. All three national newspapers – two Burmese language dailies &quot;Myanma Alin&quot; () and &quot;Kyemon&quot; (), and the English language &quot;The New Light of Myanmar&quot; – are published by the government. Semi-governmental &quot;The Myanmar Times&quot; weekly, published in Burmese and in English, is mainly geared for Yangon&#x27;s expatriate community. There are over 20 special interest journals and magazines covering sports, fashion, finance, crime, and literature (but never politics).

Access to foreign media is extremely difficult. Satellite television in Yangon, and in Burma, is very expensive as the government imposes an annual registration fee of Ks.10,00,000/-, equivalent to around U$600/year. Certain foreign newspapers and periodicals such as the &quot;Straits Times&quot; can be found only in a few (mostly downtown) bookstores. Internet access in Yangon, which has the best telecommunication infrastructure in the country, is slow and erratic at best, and the Burmese government implements one of the world&#x27;s most restrictive regimes of internet control. International text messaging and voice messaging was permitted only in August 2008.

===Communication===
Common facilities taken for granted elsewhere are luxury prized items in Yangon and Burma. The price of a GSM mobile phone was about K1.1 million in August 2008. In 2007, the country of 55 million had only 775,000 phone lines (including 275,000 mobile phones), and 400,000 computers. Even in Yangon, which has the best infrastructure, the estimated telephone penetration rate was only 6% at the end of 2004, and the official waiting time for a telephone line was 3.6 years. Most people cannot afford a computer and have to use the city&#x27;s numerous Internet cafes to access a heavily restricted internet, and a heavily censored local intranet. According to official statistics, in July 2010, the country had over 400,000 internet users, with the vast majority hailing from just two cities, Yangon and Mandalay. Although internet access was available in 42 cities across the country, the number of users outside the two main cities was just over 10,000.

===Lifestyle===

Yangon&#x27;s property market is the most expensive in the country and beyond the reach of most Yangonites. Most rent outside the centre and few can afford to rent such apartments. (In 2008, rents for a typical apartments in the centre and vicinity range between K70,000 and K150,000 and those for high end condos between K200,000 and K500,000.)
Yangon is home to pagoda festivals (&quot;paya pwe&quot;), held during dry-season months (November – March). The most famous of all, the Shwedagon Pagoda Festival in March, attracts thousands of pilgrims from around the country.

Yangon&#x27;s museums are the domain of tourists and rarely visited by the locals.

Most of Yangon&#x27;s larger hotels offer nightlife entertainment, geared towards tourists and the well-to-do Burmese. Some hotels offer traditional Burmese performing arts shows complete with a traditional Burmese orchestra. The pub scene in larger hotels is more or less the same as elsewhere in Asia. Other options include karaoke bars and pub restaurants in Yangon Chinatown.

==Sports==

As the city has the best sporting facilities in the country, most national-level annual sporting tournaments such as track and field, football, volleyball, tennis and swimming are held in Yangon. The 40,000-seat Aung San Stadium and the 32,000-seat Thuwunna Stadium are the main venues for the popular annual State and Division football tournament. Until April 2009, the now-defunct Myanmar Premier League, consisted of 16 Yangon-based clubs, played all its matches in Yangon stadiums, and attracted little interest from the general public or commercial success despite the enormous popularity of football in Burma. Most Yangonites prefer watching European football on satellite TV. Teams such as Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City are among the favorite European teams among the Yangonites. It remains to be seen whether the Myanmar National League, the country&#x27;s first professional football league, and its Yangon-based club Yangon United FC will attract a sufficient following in the country&#x27;s most important media market.

Yangon is also home to annual the Myanmar Open golf tournament, and the Myanmar Open tennis tournament. The city hosted the 1961 and 1969 South East Asian Games. During colonial times, cricket was played mostly by British officials in the city. First-class cricket was played in the city in January 1927 when the touring Marylebone Cricket Club played Burma and the Rangoon Gymkhana. Two grounds were used to host these matches, the BAA Ground and the Gymkhana Ground. These matches mark the only time Burma and Rangoon Gymkhana have appeared in first-class cricket, and the only time first-class cricket has been played in Burma. After independence cricket all but died out in the country.

Yangon has a growing population of skateboarders, as documented in the films Altered Focus: Burma and Youth of Yangon. German non-profit organization Make Life Skate Life has received permission from the Yangon City Development Committee to construct a concrete skatepark at Thakin Mya park in downtown. The park was completed in 2015 and is available free of charge to anyone in the city.

==Economy==

Yangon is the country&#x27;s main center for trade, industry, real estate, media, entertainment and tourism. The city represents about one fifth of the national economy. According to official statistics for FY 2010–2011, the size of the economy of Yangon Region was 8.93 trillion kyats, or 23% of the national GDP.
The city is Lower Burma&#x27;s main trading hub for all kinds of merchandise – from basic foodstuffs to used cars although commerce continues to be hampered by the city&#x27;s severely underdeveloped banking industry and communication infrastructure. Bayinnaung Market is the largest wholesale center in the country for rice, beans and pulses, and other agricultural commodities. Much of the country&#x27;s legal imports and exports go through Thilawa Port, the largest and busiest port in Burma. There is also a great deal of informal trade, especially in street markets that exist alongside street platforms of Downtown Yangon&#x27;s townships. However, on 17 June 2011, the YCDC announced that street vendors, who had previously been allowed to legally open shop at 3  pm, would be prohibited from selling on the streets, and permitted to sell only in their townships of residence. Since 1 December 2009, high-density polyethylene plastic bags have been banned by city authorities.

Manufacturing accounts for a sizeable share of employment. At least 14 light industrial zones ring Yangon, directly employing over 150,000 workers in 4,300 factories in early 2010. The city is the centre of country&#x27;s garment industry which exported US$292 million in 2008/9 fiscal year. More than 80 percent of factory workers in Yangon work on a day-to-day basis. Most are young women between 15 and 27 years of age who come from the countryside in search of a better life. The manufacturing sector suffers from both structural problems (e.g. chronic power shortages) and political problems (e.g. economic sanctions). In 2008, Yangon&#x27;s 2500 factories alone needed about 120 MW of power; yet, the entire city received only about 250 MW of the 530 MW needed. Chronic power shortages limit the factories&#x27; operating hours between 8 am and 6 pm.

Construction is a major source of employment. The construction industry has been negatively affected by the move of state apparatus and civil servants to Naypyidaw, new regulations introduced in August 2009 requiring builders to provide at least 12 parking spaces in every new high-rise building, and the general poor business climate. As of January 2010, the number of new high-rise building starts approved in 2009–2010 was only 334, compared to 582 in 2008–2009.

Tourism represents a major source of foreign currency for the city although by south-east Asian standards the number of foreign visitors to Yangon has always been quite low—about 250,000 before the Saffron Revolution in September 2007. The number of visitors dipped even further following the Saffron Revolution and Cyclone Nargis. The recent improvement in the country&#x27;s political climate has attracted an increasing number of businessmen and tourists. Between 300,000 and 400,000 visitors that went through Yangon International in 2011. However, after years of underinvestment, Yangon&#x27;s modest hotel infrastructure—only 3000 of the total 8000 hotel rooms in Yangon are &quot;suitable for tourists&quot;—is already bursting at seams, and will need to be expanded to handle additional visitors. As part of an urban development strategy, a hotel zone has been planned in Yangon&#x27;s outskirts, encompassing government- and military-owned land in Mingaladon, Hlegu and Htaukkyant Townships.

==Education==
Yangon educational facilities has a very high number of qualified teachers but the state spending on education is among the lowest of the world. Around 2007 estimate by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies puts the spending for education at 0.5% of the national budget. The disparity in educational opportunities and achievement between rich and poor schools is quite stark even within the city. With little or no state support forthcoming, schools have to rely on forced &quot;donations&quot; and fees from parents for nearly everything – school maintenance to teachers&#x27; salaries, forcing many poor students to drop out.

While many students in poor districts fail to reach high school, a handful of Yangon high schools in wealthier districts such as Dagon 1, Sanchaung 2, Kamayut 2, Bahan 2, Latha 2, and TTC provide the majority of students admitted to the most selective universities in the country, highlighting the extreme shallowness of talent pool in the country. The wealthy bypass the state education system altogether, sending their children to private English language instruction schools such as YIEC or more widely known as ISM, or abroad (typically Singapore or Australia) for university education. In 2014, international schools in Yangon cost at least US$8,000 a year.

There are over 20 universities and colleges in the city. While Yangon University remains the best known (its main campus is a part of popular Burmese culture e.g. literature, music, film, etc.), the nation&#x27;s oldest university is now mostly a graduate school, deprived of undergraduate studies. Following the 1988 nationwide uprising, the military government has repeatedly closed universities, and has dispersed most of the undergraduate student population to new universities in the suburbs such as Dagon University, the University of East Yangon and the University of West Yangon. Nonetheless, many of the country&#x27;s most selective universities are still in Yangon. Students from around the country still have to come to study in Yangon as some subjects are offered only at its universities. The University of Medicine 1, University of Medicine 2, Yangon Technological University, University of Computer Studies and Myanmar Maritime University are the most selective in the country.

Schools for foreign expatriates include:
* International School of Myanmar
* International School Yangon
* Myanmar International School
* Yangon International School
* Lycée français international de Rangoun - Joseph-Kessel
* Yangon Japanese School

==Health care==
The general state of health care in Yangon is poor. According to a 2007 estimate, the military government spends 0.4% of the national budget on health care, and 40% to 60% on defence. By the government&#x27;s own figures, it spends 849 kyats (US$0.85) per person. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals including the flagship Yangon General Hospital lack many of the basic facilities and equipment.

Wealthier Yangonites still have access to country&#x27;s best medical facilities and internationally qualified doctors. Only Yangon and Mandalay have any sizeable number of doctors left as many Burmese doctors have emigrated. The well-to-do go to private clinics or hospitals like Pun Hlaing International Hospital and Bahosi Medical Clinic. Medical malpractice is widespread, even in private clinics and hospitals that serve the well-to-do. In 2009 and 2010, a spate of high-profile deaths brought out the severity of the problem, even for the relatively well off Yangonites. The wealthy do not rely on domestic hospitals and travel abroad, usually Bangkok or Singapore, for treatment.

The following are healthcare facilities in Yangon in 2010–2011.

<text>SISAL (Streams and Iteration in a Single Assignment Language) is a general-purpose single assignment functional programming language with strict semantics, implicit parallelism, and efficient array handling.

SISAL outputs a dataflow graph in Intermediary Form 1 (IF1). It was derived from the Value-oriented Algorithmic Language (VAL), designed by Jack Dennis, and adds recursion and finite streams. It has a Pascal-like syntax and was designed to be a common high-level programming language for numerical programs on a variety of multiprocessors.

== History ==
SISAL was defined in 1983 by James McGraw et al., at the University of Manchester, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Colorado State University and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It was revised in 1985, and the first compiled implementation was made in 1986. Its performance is superior to C and rivals Fortran, according to some sources, combined with efficient and automatic parallelization.

SISAL&#x27;s name came from grepping &quot;sal&quot; for &quot;Single Assignment Language&quot; from the Unix dictionary /usr/dict/words.

Versions exist for the Cray X-MP, Y-MP, 2; Sequent, Encore Alliant, DEC DEC VAX-11/784, dataflow architectures, KSR1, Inmos Transputers, and systolic arrays.

== Architecture==

The requirements for a fine-grain parallelism language are better met with a dataflow programming language than a system programming language.

SISAL is more than just a dataflow and fine-grain language. It is a set of tools that convert a textual human readable dataflow language into a graph format (named &quot;IF1&quot; - Intermediary Form 1). Part of the SISAL project also involved converting this graph format into runnable C code.

== SISAL Renaissance Era ==
In 2010 SISAL saw a brief resurgence when a group of undergraduates at Worcester Polytechnic Institute investigated implementing a fine-grain parallelism backend for the SISAL language.

In 2018 SISAL was modernized with indent-based syntax, first-class functions, lambdas, closures and lazy semantics within a project SISAL-IS.

<text>Sisal (, ; Agave sisalana) is a species of flowering plant native to southern Mexico, but widely cultivated and naturalized in many other countries. It yields a stiff fibre used in making rope and various other products. The sisal fibre is traditionally used for rope and twine, and has many other uses, including paper, cloth, footwear, hats, bags, carpets, geotextiles, and dartboards. It is also used as fibre reinforcements for composite fibreglass, rubber, and concrete products. It can also be fermented and distilled to make mezcal.

Sisal has an uncertain native origin, but is thought to have originated in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Sisal plants have a lifespan of 7–10 years, producing 200–250 usable leaves containing fibers used in various applications. Sisal is a tropical and subtropical plant, thriving in temperatures above and sunshine.

Historically, sisal was used by the Aztecs and Mayans for fabric and paper. It spread to other parts of the world in the 19th century, with Brazil becoming the major producer. Sisal is propagated using bulbils or suckers and can be improved genetically through tissue culture. Fibers are extracted through decortication and then dried, brushed, and baled for export.

Sisal farming initially led to environmental degradation, but it is now considered less damaging than other farming types. It is an invasive species in Hawaii and Florida.

Global sisal production in 2020 was 210,000 tonnes, with Brazil being the largest producer, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar, China, and Mexico.

==Taxonomy==
The native origin of &quot;Agave sisalana&quot; is uncertain. Traditionally, it was deemed to be a native of the Yucatán Peninsula, but no records exist of botanical collections from there. They were originally shipped from the Spanish colonial port of Sisal in Yucatán (thus the name). The Yucatán plantations now cultivate henequen (&quot;Agave fourcroydes&quot;).

H. S. Gentry hypothesized a Chiapas origin, on the strength of traditional local usage. Evidence of an indigenous cottage industry there suggests it as the original habitat location, possibly as a cross of &quot;Agave angustifolia&quot; and &quot;Agave kewensis&quot;. The species is now naturalized in other parts of Mexico, as well as in Spain, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Madagascar, Réunion, Seychelles, many parts of Africa, China, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Burma, Cambodia, Thailand, the Solomon Islands, Queensland, Fiji, Hawaii, Florida, Central America, Ecuador, and the West Indies.

===Plant description===
Sisal plants consist of a rosette of sword-shaped leaves about tall. Young leaves may have a few minute teeth along their margins, but lose them as they mature.

The sisal plant has a 7- to 10-year lifespan and typically produces 200–250 commercially usable leaves. Each leaf contains around 1000 fibres. The fibres account for only about 4% of the plant by weight. Sisal is considered a plant of the tropics and subtropics, since production benefits from temperatures above and sunshine.

==Cultivation==
Sisal was used by the Aztecs and the Mayans to make fabrics and paper.

In the 19th century, sisal cultivation spread to Florida, the Caribbean islands, and Brazil (Paraiba and Bahia), as well as to countries in Africa, notably Tanzania and Kenya, and Asia. Sisal reportedly &quot;came to Africa from Florida, through the mechanism of a remarkable German botanist, by the name of Hindorf.&quot;

In Cuba, its cultivation was introduced in 1880, by Fernando Heydrich in Matanzas.

The first commercial plantings in Brazil were made in the late 1930s, and the first sisal fibre exports from there were made in 1948. Brazilian production did not accelerate until the 1960s, and the first of many spinning mills was established. Today, Brazil is the major world producer of sisal. Both positive and negative environmental impacts arise from sisal growing.

===Propagation===
Propagation of sisal is generally by using bulbils produced from buds in the flower stalk or by suckers growing around the base of the plant, which are grown in nursery fields until large enough to be transplanted to their final positions. These methods offer no potential for genetic improvement. &quot;In vitro&quot; multiplication of selected genetic material using meristematic tissue culture offers considerable potential for the development of improved genetic material.

===Fibre extraction===
Fibre is extracted by a process known as decortication, where leaves are crushed, beaten, and brushed away by a rotating wheel set with blunt knives, so that only fibres remain. Alternatively, in East Africa, where production is typically on large estates, the leaves are transported to a central decortication plant, where water is used to wash away the waste parts of the leaves.

The fibre is then dried, brushed, and baled for export. Proper drying is important, as fibre quality depends largely on moisture content. Artificial drying has been found to result in generally better grades of fibre than sun drying, but is not always feasible in the less industrialised countries where sisal is produced. In the drier climate of north-east Brazil, sisal is mainly grown by smallholders and the fibre is extracted by teams using portable &quot;raspadors&quot;, which do not use water.

Fibre is subsequently cleaned by brushing. Dry fibres are machine combed and sorted into various grades, largely on the basis of the previous in-field separation of leaves into size groups.

===Environmental impacts===
Sisal farming initially caused environmental degradation, because sisal plantations replaced native forests, but is still considered less damaging than many types of farming. No chemical fertilizers are used in sisal production, and although herbicides are occasionally used, even this impact may be eliminated, since most weeding is done by hand. The effluent from the decortication process causes serious pollution when it is allowed to flow into watercourses.

Sisal is considered to be an invasive species in Hawaii and Florida.

==Uses==
Traditionally, sisal has been the leading material for agricultural twine (binder twine and baler twine) because of its strength, durability, ability to stretch, affinity for certain dyestuffs, and resistance to deterioration in saltwater. The importance of this traditional use is diminishing with competition from polypropylene and the development of other haymaking techniques, while new higher-valued sisal products have been developed.

Apart from ropes, twines, and general cordage, sisal is used in low-cost and specialty paper, dartboards, buffing cloth, filters, geotextiles, mattresses, carpets, handicrafts, wire rope cores, and macramé. Sisal has been used as an environmentally friendly strengthening agent to replace asbestos and fibreglass in composite materials in various uses, including the automobile industry. The lower-grade fibre is processed by the paper industry because of its high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses. The medium-grade fibre is used in the cordage industry for making ropes and baler and binder twine. Ropes and twines are widely employed for marine, agricultural, and general industrial use. The higher-grade fibre after treatment is converted into yarns and used by the carpet industry.

Other products developed from sisal fibre include spa products, cat-scratching posts, lumbar support belts, rugs, slippers, cloths, and disc buffers. Sisal wall covering meets the abrasion and tearing resistance standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials and of the National Fire Protection Association.

Sisal walls were used very frequently in the construction of Mormon meetinghouses built between 1985 and 2010. Because of its frequent use, it has become a meme in Mormon culture.

As extraction of fibre uses only a small percentage of the plant, some attempts to improve economic viability have focused on using the waste material for production of biogas, for stockfeed, or the extraction of pharmaceutical materials.

Sisal is a valuable forage for honeybees because of its long flowering period. It is particularly attractive to them during pollen shortage. The honey produced, however, is dark and has a strong and unpleasant flavour.

Because sisal is an agave, it can be fermented and distilled to make mezcal. In India, it may be an ingredient in some street snacks.

===Carpets===
Despite the yarn durability for which sisal is known, slight matting of sisal carpeting may occur in high-traffic areas. Sisal carpet does not build up static nor does it trap dust, so vacuuming is the only maintenance required. High-spill areas should be treated with a fibre sealer and for spot removal, a dry-cleaning powder is recommended. Depending on climatic conditions, sisal absorbs air humidity or releases it, causing expansion or contraction. Sisal is not recommended for areas that receive wet spills or rain or snow. Sisal is used by itself in carpets or in blends with wool and acrylic for a softer hand.

== Global production and trade patterns ==

Global production of sisal fibre in 2020 amounted to 210 thousand tonnes, of which Brazil, the largest producing country, produced 86,061 tonnes.

Tanzania produced about 36,379 tons, Kenya produced 22,768 tonnes, Madagascar 17,578 tonnes, and 14,006 tonnes were produced in China. Mexico contributed 13,107 tons with smaller amounts coming from Haiti, Morocco, Venezuela, and South Africa. Sisal occupies sixth place among fibre plants, representing 2% of the world&#x27;s production of plant fibre (plant fibres provide 65% of the world&#x27;s fibre).

==Heraldry==
The sisal plant appears in the coat of arms of Barquisimeto, Venezuela.

An unofficial coat of arms for the Mexican state of Yucatán features a deer bounding over a sisal plant.

== In literature ==
Journalist John Gunther wrote of sisal in 1953, &quot;if it had not been for the fact that sisal is a difficult crop, there might not have been a Munich in 1939. Neville Chamberlain started out life as a sisal planter in the Bahamas, and only returned to Britain and entered politics when he found that this obdurate vegetable was too hard to grow.&quot;

<text>A multiplication algorithm is an algorithm (or method) to multiply two numbers. Depending on the size of the numbers, different algorithms are more efficient than others. Numerous algorithms are known and there has been much research into the topic.

The oldest and simplest method, known since antiquity as long multiplication or grade-school multiplication, consists of multiplying every digit in the first number by every digit in the second and adding the results. This has a time complexity of formula_1, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of digits. When done by hand, this may also be reframed as grid method multiplication or lattice multiplication. In software, this may be called &quot;shift and add&quot; due to bitshifts and addition being the only two operations needed.

In 1960, Anatoly Karatsuba discovered Karatsuba multiplication, unleashing a flood of research into fast multiplication algorithms. This method uses three multiplications rather than four to multiply two two-digit numbers. (A variant of this can also be used to multiply complex numbers quickly.) Done recursively, this has a time complexity of formula_2. Splitting numbers into more than two parts results in Toom-Cook multiplication; for example, using three parts results in the Toom-3 algorithm. Using many parts can set the exponent arbitrarily close to 1, but the constant factor also grows, making it impractical.

In 1968, the Schönhage-Strassen algorithm, which makes use of a Fourier transform over a modulus, was discovered. It has a time complexity of formula_3. In 2007, Martin Fürer proposed an algorithm with complexity formula_4. In 2014, Harvey, Joris van der Hoeven, and Lecerf proposed one with complexity formula_5, thus making the implicit constant explicit; this was improved to formula_6 in 2018. Lastly, in 2019, Harvey and van der Hoeven came up with a galactic algorithm with complexity formula_7. This matches a guess by Schönhage and Strassen that this would be the optimal bound, although this remains a conjecture today.

Integer multiplication algorithms can also be used to multiply polynomials by means of the method of Kronecker substitution.

==Long multiplication==
If a positional numeral system is used, a natural way of multiplying numbers is taught in schools
as long multiplication, sometimes called grade-school multiplication, sometimes called the Standard Algorithm:
multiply the by each digit of the and then add up all the properly shifted results. It requires memorization of the multiplication table for single digits.

This is the usual algorithm for multiplying larger numbers by hand in base 10. A person doing long multiplication on paper will write down all the products and then add them together; an abacus-user will sum the products as soon as each one is computed.

===Example===
This example uses &quot;long multiplication&quot; to multiply 23,958,233 (multiplicand) by 5,830 (multiplier) and arrives at 139,676,498,390 for the result (product).
 23958233
 × 5830
 00000000 ( = 23,958,233 × 0)
 71874699 ( = 23,958,233 × 30)
 191665864 ( = 23,958,233 × 800)
 + 119791165 ( = 23,958,233 × 5,000)
 139676498390 ( = 139,676,498,390)

====Other notations====
In some countries such as Germany, the above multiplication is depicted similarly but with the original product kept horizontal and computation starting with the first digit of the multiplier: 

 23958233 · 5830
 119791165
 191665864
 71874699
 00000000
 139676498390

Below pseudocode describes the process of above multiplication. It keeps only one row to maintain the sum which finally becomes the result. Note that the &#x27;+=&#x27; operator is used to denote sum to existing value and store operation (akin to languages such as Java and C) for compactness.
multiply(a[1..p], b[1..q], base) // Operands containing rightmost digits at index 1
 product = [1..p+q] // Allocate space for result
 for b_i = 1 to q // for all digits in b
 carry = 0
 for a_i = 1 to p // for all digits in a
 product[a_i + b_i - 1] += carry + a[a_i] * b[b_i]
 carry = product[a_i + b_i - 1] / base
 product[a_i + b_i - 1] = product[a_i + b_i - 1] mod base
 product[b_i + p] = carry // last digit comes from final carry
 return product
===Usage in computers===
Some chips implement long multiplication, in hardware or in microcode, for various integer and floating-point word sizes. In arbitrary-precision arithmetic, it is common to use long multiplication with the base set to 2&quot;w&quot;, where &quot;w&quot; is the number of bits in a word, for multiplying relatively small numbers. To multiply two numbers with &quot;n&quot; digits using this method, one needs about &quot;n&quot;2 operations. More formally, multiplying two &quot;n&quot;-digit numbers using long multiplication requires Θ(&quot;n&quot;2) single-digit operations (additions and multiplications).

When implemented in software, long multiplication algorithms must deal with overflow during additions, which can be expensive. A typical solution is to represent the number in a small base, &quot;b&quot;, such that, for example, 8&quot;b&quot; is a representable machine integer. Several additions can then be performed before an overflow occurs. When the number becomes too large, we add part of it to the result, or we carry and map the remaining part back to a number that is less than &quot;b&quot;. This process is called &quot;normalization&quot;. Richard Brent used this approach in his Fortran package, MP.

Computers initially used a very similar algorithm to long multiplication in base 2, but modern processors have optimized circuitry for fast multiplications using more efficient algorithms, at the price of a more complex hardware realization. In base two, long multiplication is sometimes called &quot;shift and add&quot;, because the algorithm simplifies and just consists of shifting left (multiplying by powers of two) and adding. Most currently available microprocessors implement this or other similar algorithms (such as Booth encoding) for various integer and floating-point sizes in hardware multipliers or in microcode.

On currently available processors, a bit-wise shift instruction is usually (but not always) faster than a multiply instruction and can be used to multiply (shift left) and divide (shift right) by powers of two. Multiplication by a constant and division by a constant can be implemented using a sequence of shifts and adds or subtracts. For example, there are several ways to multiply by 10 using only bit-shift and addition.

 ((x « 2) + x) « 1 # Here 10*x is computed as (x*2^2 + x)*2
 (x « 3) + (x « 1) # Here 10*x is computed as x*2^3 + x*2

In some cases such sequences of shifts and adds or subtracts will outperform hardware multipliers and especially dividers. A division by a number of the form formula_8 or formula_9 often can be converted to such a short sequence.

==Algorithms for multiplying by hand==

In addition to the standard long multiplication, there are several other methods used to perform multiplication by hand. Such algorithms may be devised for speed, ease of calculation, or educational value, particularly when computers or multiplication tables are unavailable.

===Grid method===

The grid method (or box method) is an introductory method for multiple-digit multiplication that is often taught to pupils at primary school or elementary school. It has been a standard part of the national primary school mathematics curriculum in England and Wales since the late 1990s.

Both factors are broken up (&quot;partitioned&quot;) into their hundreds, tens and units parts, and the products of the parts are then calculated explicitly in a relatively simple multiplication-only stage, before these contributions are then totalled to give the final answer in a separate addition stage.

The calculation 34 × 13, for example, could be computed using the grid:


followed by addition to obtain 442, either in a single sum (see right), or through forming the row-by-row totals 
: (300 + 40) + (90 + 12) = 340 + 102 = 442.

This calculation approach (though not necessarily with the explicit grid arrangement) is also known as the partial products algorithm. Its essence is the calculation of the simple multiplications separately, with all addition being left to the final gathering-up stage.

The grid method can in principle be applied to factors of any size, although the number of sub-products becomes cumbersome as the number of digits increases. Nevertheless, it is seen as a usefully explicit method to introduce the idea of multiple-digit multiplications; and, in an age when most multiplication calculations are done using a calculator or a spreadsheet, it may in practice be the only multiplication algorithm that some students will ever need.

===Lattice multiplication===


Lattice, or sieve, multiplication is algorithmically equivalent to long multiplication. It requires the preparation of a lattice (a grid drawn on paper) which guides the calculation and separates all the multiplications from the additions. It was introduced to Europe in 1202 in Fibonacci&#x27;s Liber Abaci. Fibonacci described the operation as mental, using his right and left hands to carry the intermediate calculations. Matrakçı Nasuh presented 6 different variants of this method in this 16th-century book, Umdet-ul Hisab. It was widely used in Enderun schools across the Ottoman Empire. Napier&#x27;s bones, or Napier&#x27;s rods also used this method, as published by Napier in 1617, the year of his death.

As shown in the example, the multiplicand and multiplier are written above and to the right of a lattice, or a sieve. It is found in Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s &quot;Arithmetic&quot;, one of Leonardo&#x27;s sources mentioned by Sigler, author of &quot;Fibonacci&#x27;s Liber Abaci&quot;, 2002.

*During the multiplication phase, the lattice is filled in with two-digit products of the corresponding digits labeling each row and column: the tens digit goes in the top-left corner.
*During the addition phase, the lattice is summed on the diagonals.
* Finally, if a carry phase is necessary, the answer as shown along the left and bottom sides of the lattice is converted to normal form by carrying ten&#x27;s digits as in long addition or multiplication.

====Example====
The pictures on the right show how to calculate 345 × 12 using lattice multiplication. As a more complicated example, consider the picture below displaying the computation of 23,958,233 multiplied by 5,830 (multiplier); the result is 139,676,498,390. Notice 23,958,233 is along the top of the lattice and 5,830 is along the right side. The products fill the lattice and the sum of those products (on the diagonal) are along the left and bottom sides. Then those sums are totaled as shown.
===Russian peasant multiplication===

The binary method is also known as peasant multiplication, because it has been widely used by people who are classified as peasants and thus have not memorized the multiplication tables required for long multiplication. The algorithm was in use in ancient Egypt. Its main advantages are that it can be taught quickly, requires no memorization, and can be performed using tokens, such as poker chips, if paper and pencil aren&#x27;t available. The disadvantage is that it takes more steps than long multiplication, so it can be unwieldy for large numbers.

====Description====
On paper, write down in one column the numbers you get when you repeatedly halve the multiplier, ignoring the remainder; in a column beside it repeatedly double the multiplicand. Cross out each row in which the last digit of the first number is even, and add the remaining numbers in the second column to obtain the product.

====Examples====
This example uses peasant multiplication to multiply 11 by 3 to arrive at a result of 33.

 Decimal: Binary:
 11 3 1011 11
 5 6 101 110
 2 12 10 1100
 1 24 1 11000
 33 100001

Describing the steps explicitly:

* 11 and 3 are written at the top
* 11 is halved (5.5) and 3 is doubled (6). The fractional portion is discarded (5.5 becomes 5).
* 5 is halved (2.5) and 6 is doubled (12). The fractional portion is discarded (2.5 becomes 2). The figure in the left column (2) is even, so the figure in the right column (12) is discarded.
* 2 is halved (1) and 12 is doubled (24).
* All not-scratched-out values are summed: 3 + 6 + 24 = 33.

The method works because multiplication is distributive, so:

: formula_10

A more complicated example, using the figures from the earlier examples (23,958,233 and 5,830):

===Quarter square multiplication===

This formula can in some cases be used, to make multiplication tasks easier to complete:

: formula_11

In the case where formula_12 and formula_13 are integers, we have that
:formula_14
because formula_15 and formula_16 are either both even or both odd. This means that
:formula_17
and it&#x27;s sufficient to (pre-)compute the integral part of squares divided by 4 like in the following example.

====Examples ====
Below is a lookup table of quarter squares with the remainder discarded for the digits 0 through 18; this allows for the multiplication of numbers up to .

If, for example, you wanted to multiply 9 by 3, you observe that the sum and difference are 12 and 6 respectively. Looking both those values up on the table yields 36 and 9, the difference of which is 27, which is the product of 9 and 3.

====History of quarter square multiplication====

In prehistoric time, quarter square multiplication involved floor function; that some sources attribute to Babylonian mathematics (2000–1600 BC).

Antoine Voisin published a table of quarter squares from 1 to 1000 in 1817 as an aid in multiplication. A larger table of quarter squares from 1 to 100000 was published by Samuel Laundy in 1856, and a table from 1 to 200000 by Joseph Blater in 1888.

Quarter square multipliers were used in analog computers to form an analog signal that was the product of two analog input signals. In this application, the sum and difference of two input voltages are formed using operational amplifiers. The square of each of these is approximated using piecewise linear circuits. Finally the difference of the two squares is formed and scaled by a factor of one fourth using yet another operational amplifier.

In 1980, Everett L. Johnson proposed using the quarter square method in a digital multiplier. To form the product of two 8-bit integers, for example, the digital device forms the sum and difference, looks both quantities up in a table of squares, takes the difference of the results, and divides by four by shifting two bits to the right. For 8-bit integers the table of quarter squares will have 29−1=511 entries (one entry for the full range 0..510 of possible sums, the differences using only the first 256 entries in range 0..255) or 29−1=511 entries (using for negative differences the technique of 2-complements and 9-bit masking, which avoids testing the sign of differences), each entry being 16-bit wide (the entry values are from (0²/4)=0 to (510²/4)=65025).

The quarter square multiplier technique has benefited 8-bit systems that do not have any support for a hardware multiplier. Charles Putney implemented this for the 6502.

==Computational complexity of multiplication==

A line of research in theoretical computer science is about the number of single-bit arithmetic operations necessary to multiply two formula_18-bit integers. This is known as the computational complexity of multiplication. Usual algorithms done by hand have asymptotic complexity of formula_1, but in 1960 Anatoly Karatsuba discovered that better complexity was possible (with the Karatsuba algorithm).

Currently, the algorithm with the best computational complexity is a 2019 algorithm of David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven, which uses the strategies of using number-theoretic transforms introduced with the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm to multiply integers using only formula_7 operations. This is conjectured to be the best possible algorithm, but lower bounds of formula_21 are not known.

===Karatsuba multiplication===
Karatsuba multiplication is an O(&quot;n&quot;log23) ≈ O(&quot;n&quot;1.585) divide and conquer algorithm, that uses recursion to merge together sub calculations. 

By rewriting the formula, one makes it possible to do sub calculations / recursion. By doing recursion, one can solve this in a fast manner.

Let formula_12 and formula_13 be represented as formula_18-digit strings in some base formula_25. For any positive integer formula_26 less than formula_18, one can write the two given numbers as

:formula_28
:formula_29

where formula_30 and formula_31 are less than formula_32. The product is then

formula_33

where

:formula_34
:formula_35
:formula_36

These formulae require four multiplications and were known to Charles Babbage. Karatsuba observed that formula_37 can be computed in only three multiplications, at the cost of a few extra additions. With formula_38 and formula_39 as before one can observe that

:formula_40

Because of the overhead of recursion, Karatsuba&#x27;s multiplication is slower than long multiplication for small values of &quot;n&quot;; typical implementations therefore switch to long multiplication for small values of &quot;n&quot;.

==== General case with multiplication of N numbers ====

By exploring patterns after expansion, one see following:

formula_41

Each summand is associated to a unique binary number from 0 to
formula_42, for example formula_43 etc. Furthermore; B is powered to number of 1, in this binary string, multiplied with m.

If we express this in fewer terms, we get:

formula_44, where formula_45 means digit in number i at position j. Notice that formula_46

formula_47

==== History ====
Karatsuba&#x27;s algorithm was the first known algorithm for multiplication that is asymptotically faster than long multiplication, and can thus be viewed as the starting point for the theory of fast multiplications.

===Toom–Cook===

Another method of multiplication is called Toom–Cook or Toom-3. The Toom–Cook method splits each number to be multiplied into multiple parts. The Toom–Cook method is one of the generalizations of the Karatsuba method. A three-way Toom–Cook can do a size-&quot;3N&quot; multiplication for the cost of five size-&quot;N&quot; multiplications. This accelerates the operation by a factor of 9/5, while the Karatsuba method accelerates it by 4/3.

Although using more and more parts can reduce the time spent on recursive multiplications further, the overhead from additions and digit management also grows. For this reason, the method of Fourier transforms is typically faster for numbers with several thousand digits, and asymptotically faster for even larger numbers.

===Schönhage–Strassen===

Every number in base B, can be written as a polynomial:

formula_48

Furthermore, multiplication of two numbers could be thought of as a product of two polynomials:

formula_49

Because,for formula_50: formula_51,
we have a convolution. 

By using fft (fast fourier transformation) with convolution rule, we can get

formula_52. That is; formula_53, where formula_54
is the corresponding coefficient in fourier space. This can also be written as: formula_55.
We have the same coefficient due to linearity under fourier transformation, and because these polynomials 
only consist of one unique term per coefficient:

formula_56 and 
formula_57

* Convolution rule: formula_58

We have reduced our convolution problem
to product problem, through fft.

By finding ifft (polynomial interpolation), for each formula_59, one get the desired coefficients.

Algorithm uses divide and conquer strategy, to divide problem to subproblems.

It has a time complexity of O(&quot;n&quot; log(&quot;n&quot;) log(log(&quot;n&quot;))).

==== History ====

The algorithm was invented by Strassen (1968). It was made practical and theoretical guarantees were provided in 1971 by Schönhage and Strassen resulting in the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm.

=== Further improvements ===

In 2007 the asymptotic complexity of integer multiplication was improved by the Swiss mathematician Martin Fürer of Pennsylvania State University to formula_60 using Fourier transforms over complex numbers, where log* denotes the iterated logarithm. Anindya De, Chandan Saha, Piyush Kurur and Ramprasad Saptharishi gave a similar algorithm using modular arithmetic in 2008 achieving the same running time. In context of the above material, what these latter authors have achieved is to find &quot;N&quot; much less than 23&quot;k&quot; + 1, so that &quot;Z&quot;/&quot;NZ&quot; has a (2&quot;m&quot;)th root of unity. This speeds up computation and reduces the time complexity. However, these latter algorithms are only faster than Schönhage–Strassen for impractically large inputs.

In 2014, Harvey, Joris van der Hoeven and Lecerf gave a new algorithm that achieves a running time of formula_61, making explicit the implied constant in the formula_62 exponent. They also proposed a variant of their algorithm which achieves formula_63 but whose validity relies on standard conjectures about the distribution of Mersenne primes. In 2016, Covanov and Thomé proposed an integer multiplication algorithm based on a generalization of Fermat primes that conjecturally achieves a complexity bound of formula_63. This matches the 2015 conditional result of Harvey, van der Hoeven, and Lecerf but uses a different algorithm and relies on a different conjecture. In 2018, Harvey and van der Hoeven used an approach based on the existence of short lattice vectors guaranteed by Minkowski&#x27;s theorem to prove an unconditional complexity bound of formula_63.

In March 2019, David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven announced their discovery of an multiplication algorithm. It was published in the &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; in 2021. Because Schönhage and Strassen predicted that &quot;n&quot; log(&quot;n&quot;) is the &quot;best possible&quot; result, Harvey said: &quot;...our work is expected to be the end of the road for this problem, although we don&#x27;t know yet how to prove this rigorously.&quot;

===Lower bounds===
There is a trivial lower bound of Ω(&quot;n&quot;) for multiplying two &quot;n&quot;-bit numbers on a single processor; no matching algorithm (on conventional machines, that is on Turing equivalent machines) nor any sharper lower bound is known. Multiplication lies outside of AC0[&quot;p&quot;] for any prime &quot;p&quot;, meaning there is no family of constant-depth, polynomial (or even subexponential) size circuits using AND, OR, NOT, and MOD&quot;p&quot; gates that can compute a product. This follows from a constant-depth reduction of MOD&quot;q&quot; to multiplication. Lower bounds for multiplication are also known for some classes of branching programs.

==Complex number multiplication==
Complex multiplication normally involves four multiplications and two additions.

:formula_66

Or

:formula_67

As observed by Peter Ungar in 1963, one can reduce the number of multiplications to three, using essentially the same computation as Karatsuba&#x27;s algorithm. The product (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;bi&quot;) · (&quot;c&quot; + &quot;di&quot;) can be calculated in the following way.

:&quot;k&quot;1 = &quot;c&quot; · (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;)
:&quot;k&quot;2 = &quot;a&quot; · (&quot;d&quot; − &quot;c&quot;)
:&quot;k&quot;3 = &quot;b&quot; · (&quot;c&quot; + &quot;d&quot;)
:Real part = &quot;k&quot;1 − &quot;k&quot;3
:Imaginary part = &quot;k&quot;1 + &quot;k&quot;2.

This algorithm uses only three multiplications, rather than four, and five additions or subtractions rather than two. If a multiply is more expensive than three adds or subtracts, as when calculating by hand, then there is a gain in speed. On modern computers a multiply and an add can take about the same time so there may be no speed gain. There is a trade-off in that there may be some loss of precision when using floating point.

For fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) (or any linear transformation) the complex multiplies are by constant coefficients &quot;c&quot; + &quot;di&quot; (called twiddle factors in FFTs), in which case two of the additions (&quot;d&quot;−&quot;c&quot; and &quot;c&quot;+&quot;d&quot;) can be precomputed. Hence, only three multiplies and three adds are required. However, trading off a multiplication for an addition in this way may no longer be beneficial with modern floating-point units.

==Polynomial multiplication==
All the above multiplication algorithms can also be expanded to multiply polynomials. Alternatively the Kronecker substitution technique may be used to convert the problem of multiplying polynomials into a single binary multiplication.

Long multiplication methods can be generalised to allow the multiplication of algebraic formulae:

 14ac - 3ab + 2 multiplied by ac - ab + 1

 14ac -3ab 2
 ac -ab 1
 14a2c2 -3a2bc 2ac
 -14a2bc 3 a2b2 -2ab
 14ac -3ab 2
 14a2c2 -17a2bc 16ac 3a2b2 -5ab +2

As a further example of column based multiplication, consider multiplying 23 long tons (t), 12 hundredweight (cwt) and 2 quarters (qtr) by 47. This example uses avoirdupois measures: 1 t = 20 cwt, 1 cwt = 4 qtr.

 t cwt qtr
 23 12 2
 47 x
 141 94 94
 940 470
 29 23
 1110 587 94
 1110 7 2
 ================= Answer: 1110 ton 7 cwt 2 qtr

First multiply the quarters by 47, the result 94 is written into the first workspace. Next, multiply cwt 12*47 = (2 + 10)*47 but don&#x27;t add up the partial results (94, 470) yet. Likewise multiply 23 by 47 yielding (141, 940). The quarters column is totaled and the result placed in the second workspace (a trivial move in this case). 94 quarters is 23 cwt and 2 qtr, so place the 2 in the answer and put the 23 in the next column left. Now add up the three entries in the cwt column giving 587. This is 29 t 7 cwt, so write the 7 into the answer and the 29 in the column to the left. Now add up the tons column. There is no adjustment to make, so the result is just copied down.

The same layout and methods can be used for any traditional measurements and non-decimal currencies such as the old British £sd system.

<doc id="57413" wikidata="Q476864" url="?curid=57413" title="Rambutan">
<text>Rambutan ( ; Nephelium lappaceum) is a medium-sized tropical tree in the family Sapindaceae. The name also refers to the edible fruit produced by this tree. The rambutan is native to Southeast Asia. It is closely related to several other edible tropical fruits, including the lychee, longan, pulasan, and quenepa.

== Description ==
It is an evergreen tree growing to a height of . The leaves are alternate, long, pinnate, with three to eleven leaflets, each leaflet wide and broad with an entire margin.

The flowers are small, , , , and borne in erect terminal panicles wide. Rambutan trees can be male (producing only flowers and, hence, produce no fruit), female (producing flowers that are only functionally female), or hermaphroditic (producing flowers that are female with a small percentage of male flowers).

=== Fruit ===
The fruit is a round to oval single-seeded drupe, long, rarely to long and broad, borne in a loose pendant cluster of ten to twenty fruits together. The leathery skin is reddish (rarely orange or yellow) and covered with fleshy pliable spines, hence the name, which means &#x27;hairs&#x27;. The spines (also known as &quot;spinterns&quot;) contribute to the transpiration of the fruit, which can affect the fruit&#x27;s quality.

The fruit flesh, the aril, is translucent, whitish, or very pale pink, with a sweet, mildly acidic flavor reminiscent of grapes.

The single seed is glossy brown, , with a white scar. Soft and containing equal portions of saturated and unsaturated fats, the seed may be cooked and eaten, but is bitter and has narcotic properties.

== History ==
Around the 13th to 15th centuries, Arab traders, who played a major role in Indian Ocean trade, introduced rambutans to Zanzibar and Pemba in East Africa. There are limited rambutan plantings in some parts of India. In the 19th century, the Dutch introduced rambutans from Indonesia in Southeast Asia, to Suriname in South America. Subsequently, the plants spread to the tropical Americas, planted in the coastal lowlands of Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Trinidad, and Cuba. In 1912, rambutans were introduced to the Philippines from Indonesia. Further introductions were made in 1920 (from Indonesia) and 1930 (from Malaya), but until the 1950s its distribution was limited.

There was an attempt to introduce rambutans to the Southeastern United States, with seeds imported from Java, Indonesia in 1906, but the species proved to be unsuccessful, except in Puerto Rico.

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;rambutan&quot; is derived from the Malay word meaning &#x27;hair&#x27; referring to the numerous hairy protuberances of the fruits, together with the noun-building suffix . Similarly, in Vietnam, they are called (meaning &#x27;messy hair&#x27;). The Chinese name is (Mandarin &quot;hóngmáodān&quot;, Hokkien &quot;âng-mô͘-tan&quot;), literally &#x27;red-haired pellet&#x27;.

== Composition ==
=== Nutrients ===
Rambutan fruit is 78% water, 21% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat (see table; data are for canned fruit in syrup; raw fruit data are unpublished). In a reference amount of , the canned fruit supplies 82 calories and only manganese at 15% of the Daily Value (DV), while other micronutrients are in low content (less than 10% DV, table).

=== Phytochemicals ===
As an un-pigmented fruit flesh, rambutan does not contain significant polyphenol content, but its colorful rind displays diverse phenolic acids, such as syringic, coumaric, gallic, caffeic, and ellagic acids. Rambutan seeds contain equal proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, where arachidic (34%) and oleic (42%) acids, respectively, are the highest in fat content.

The pleasant fragrance of rambutan fruit derives from numerous volatile organic compounds, including beta-damascenone, vanillin, phenylacetic acid, and cinnamic acid.

== Ecology ==
=== Pollination ===
Aromatic rambutan flowers are highly attractive to many insects, especially bees. Flies (Diptera), bees (Hymenoptera), and ants (&quot;Solenopsis&quot;) are the main pollinators. Among the Diptera, &quot;Lucilia&quot; spp. are abundant, and among the Hymenoptera, honey bees (&quot;Apis dorsata&quot; and &quot;A. cerana&quot;) and the stingless bee genus &quot;Trigona&quot; are the major visitors. &quot;A. cerana&quot; colonies foraging on rambutan flowers produce large quantities of honey. Bees foraging for nectar routinely contact the stigma of female flowers and gather significant quantities of the sticky pollen from male blossoms. Little pollen has been seen on bees foraging female flowers. Although male flowers open at 06:00, foraging by &quot;A. cerana&quot; is most intense between 07:00 and 11:00, tapering off rather abruptly thereafter. In Thailand, &quot;A. cerana&quot; is the preferred species for small-scale pollination of rambutan. Its hair is also helpful in pollination where pollen can be hooked on and transported to female flowers.

== Varieties ==
Well over 200 cultivars were developed from selected clones available throughout tropical Asia. Most of the cultivars are also selected for compact growth, reaching a height of only for easier harvesting.

Compared to propagated rambutan clones, rambutans taken from the wild have a higher acidity and potential for various food purposes. In Indonesia, 22 rambutan cultivars were identified as good quality, with five as leading commercial cultivars: &#x27;Binjai&#x27;, &#x27;Lebak Bulus&#x27;, &#x27;Rapiah&#x27;, &#x27;Cimacan&#x27; and &#x27;Sinyonya&#x27;, with other popular cultivars including &#x27;Simacan&#x27;, &#x27;Silengkeng&#x27;, &#x27;Sikonto&#x27; and &#x27;Aceh kuning&#x27;. In the Malay Peninsula, commercial varieties include &#x27;Chooi Ang&#x27;, &#x27;Peng Thing Bee&#x27;, &#x27;Ya Tow&#x27;, &#x27;Azimat&#x27;, and &#x27;Ayer Mas&#x27;.

In Nicaragua, a joint World Relief–European Union team distributed seedlings to organizations such as Ascociación Pueblos en Acción Comunitaria in 2001 to more than 100 farmers. Some of these farmers saw the first production of rambutans from their trees in 2005–2006 with development directed at the local market.

In the Philippines, two cultivars of rambutans are distinguished by their seed. The common rambutan seed and fruit are difficult to separate, while the &#x27;Maharlika Rambutan&#x27; fruit separates cleanly from its seed. The fruit taste and size of these two cultivars are identical, but the &#x27;Maharlika Rambutan&#x27; is more popular with a higher price.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
The fruit of the rambutan tree may be eaten raw by removing the peel, eating the pulp, and discarding the seed. Rambutan is most often used in desserts, such as sorbets and puddings, but also in curries and savory dishes. The flavor is similar to lychee and pairs well with other tropical fruits.

== Cultivation ==
Rambutans are adapted to warm tropical climates, around , and are sensitive to temperatures below . It is grown commercially within 12–15° of the equator. The trees grow well at elevations up to above sea level and do best in deep soil, clay loam, or sandy loam rich in organic matter. They grow on hilly terrain where there is good drainage.

Rambutans are propagated by grafting, air-layering, and budding. Budded trees may fruit after two to three years with optimum production occurring after eight to ten years. Trees grown from seed bear after five to six years.

The aril is attached to the seed in some commercial cultivars, but &quot;freestone&quot; cultivars are available and in high demand. Usually, a single light brown seed is found, which is high in certain fats and oils (primarily oleic acid and arachidic acid) valuable to industry, and used in cooking and the manufacture of soap. Rambutan roots, bark, and leaves have various uses in traditional medicine and in the production of dyes.
In some areas, rambutan trees can bear fruit twice annually, once in late fall and early winter, with a shorter season in late spring and early summer. Other areas, such as Costa Rica, have a single fruit season, with the start of the rainy season in April stimulating flowering, and the fruit is usually ripe in August and September. The fragile fruit must ripen on the tree, then they are harvested over a four- to seven-week period. The fresh fruit are easily bruised and have a limited shelf life. An average tree may produce 5,000–6,000 or more fruit ( per tree). Yields begin at in young orchards and may reach on mature trees. In Hawaii, were harvested producing of fruit in 1997. Yields could be increased by improved orchard management, including pollination, and by planting high-yielding compact cultivars.

Most commercial cultivars are hermaphroditic; cultivars that produce only functionally female flowers require the presence of male trees. Male trees are seldom found, as vegetative selection has favored hermaphroditic clones that produce a high proportion of functionally female flowers and a much lower number of flowers that produce pollen. Over 3,000 greenish-white flowers occur in male panicles, each with five to seven anthers and a nonfunctional ovary. Male flowers have yellow nectaries and five to seven stamens. About 500 greenish-yellow flowers occur in each hermaphroditic panicle. Each flower has six anthers, usually a bilobed stigma, and one ovule in each of its two sections (locules). The flowers are receptive for about one day but may persist if pollinators are excluded.

In Thailand, rambutan trees were first planted in Surat Thani in 1926 by the Chinese Malay K. Vong in Ban Na San. An annual rambutan fair is held during August harvest time.

In Malaysia, rambutan flowers from March to July and again between June and November, usually in response to rain following a dry period. Flowering periods differ for other localities. Most, but not all, flowers open early in the day. Up to 100 flowers in each female panicle may be open each day during peak bloom. The initial fruit set may approach 25 percent, but a high abortion level contributes to a much lower level of production at harvest (1 to 3 percent). The fruit matures 15 to 18 weeks after flowering.

Rambutan cultivation in Sri Lanka mainly consists of small home gardens. Malwana, a village in the Kelani River Valley, is popular for its rambutan orchards. Their production comes to market in May, June, and July when it is very common to observe seasonal traders along the streets of Colombo. Sri Lanka also has some off-season rambutan production in January and February in areas such as Bibile, Medagama, and Monaragala.

Both male and female flowers are faintly sweet-scented and have functional nectaries at the ovary base. Female flowers produce two to three times more nectar than male flowers. Nectar sugar concentration ranges between 18–47 percent and is similar between the flower types. Rambutans are an important nectar source for bees in Malaysia.

Cross-pollination is a necessity because the anther is absent in most functionally female flowers. Although apomixis may occur in some cultivars, rambutans, like lychee, are dependent upon insects for pollination. In Malaysia, where only about one percent of the female flowers set fruit, no fruit is set on bagged flowers while hand pollination resulted in a 13 percent fruit set. Pollinators may maintain fidelity to either male or hermaphroditic flowers (trees), thus limiting pollination and fruit set under natural conditions where crossing between male and female flowers is required.

=== Production ===

Rambutan is a fruit tree cultivated in humid tropical Southeast Asia. It is a common garden fruit tree and propagated commercially in small orchards. It is one of the best-known fruits of Southeast Asia and is also widely cultivated elsewhere in the tropics including Africa, southern Mexico, the Caribbean islands, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Panama, India, Vietnam, Philippines, and Sri Lanka. It is also produced in Ecuador where it is known as &quot;achotillo,&quot; and on the island of Puerto Rico.

, Thailand was the largest producer of rambutans (, ), growing 450,000 tonnes, followed by Indonesia at 100,000 tonnes, and Malaysia, 60,000 tonnes. In Thailand, the major cultivation centers are Chanthaburi Province, followed by Chumphon Province and Surat Thani Province. In Indonesia, the production center of rambutan is in the western parts of Indonesia, which includes Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan. In Java, the orchards and &quot;pekarangan&quot; (habitation yards) in the villages of Greater Jakarta and West Java have been known as rambutan production centers since the colonial era, with a trading center in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta.

During 2017 and years before, imports of rambutan to the European Union were about 1,000 tonnes annually, enabling a year-round supply from numerous tropical suppliers.

The fruits are usually sold fresh and have a short shelf-life, and are commonly used in making jams and jellies, or canned. Evergreen rambutan trees with their abundant colored fruit make attractive landscape specimens.

In India, rambutan is imported from Thailand, as well as grown in the Pathanamthitta District of the southern state of Kerala.

Rambutans are not climacteric fruit—that is, they ripen only on the tree and appear not to produce a ripening agent, such as the plant hormone ethylene, after being harvested. However, at post-harvest, the quality of the fruit is affected by storage factors. Low humidity levels, storage time, and incidences of mechanical damage can severely affect the quality of the fruit which would negatively affect the demand for such. In general, the fruit has a short shelf life in ambient conditions but implementing methods that can extend such is a productional advantage. Certain treatments like irradiation and the use of hot-forced air can help in fruit preservation although the former has seen more success.

=== Distribution ===
The center of genetic diversity for rambutans is the Indonesian region. They have been widely cultivated in Southeast Asian areas, such as Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines. It has spread from there to parts of Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Central America.

<text>Evolutionary developmental biology, informally known as evo-devo, is a field of biological research that compares the developmental processes of different organisms to infer how developmental processes evolved.

The field grew from 19th-century beginnings, where embryology faced a mystery: zoologists did not know how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was that of homeotic genes that regulate development in a wide range of eukaryotes.

The field is composed of multiple core evolutionary concepts. One is deep homology, the finding that dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as &quot;pax-6&quot;, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times in different parts of the embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.

New morphological features and ultimately new species are produced by variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions. Another possibility is the neo-Lamarckian theory that epigenetic changes are later consolidated at gene level, something that may have been important early in the history of multicellular life.

==History==
===Early theories===
Philosophers began to think about how animals acquired form in the womb in classical antiquity. Aristotle asserts in his &quot;Physics&quot; treatise that according to Empedocles, order &quot;spontaneously&quot; appears in the developing embryo. In his &quot;The Parts of Animals&quot; treatise, he argues that Empedocles&#x27; theory was wrong. In Aristotle&#x27;s account, Empedocles stated that the vertebral column is divided into vertebrae because, as it happens, the embryo twists about and snaps the column into pieces. Aristotle argues instead that the process has a predefined goal: that the &quot;seed&quot; that develops into the embryo began with an inbuilt &quot;potential&quot; to become specific body parts, such as vertebrae. Further, each sort of animal gives rise to animals of its own kind: humans only have human babies.

===Recapitulation===


A recapitulation theory of evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They argued that the embryos of &#x27;higher&#x27; animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first like that of a fish, then in turn like that of a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognized four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.

===Evolutionary morphology===


From the early 19th century through most of the 20th century, embryology faced a mystery. Animals were seen to develop into adults of widely differing body plan, often through similar stages, from the egg, but zoologists knew almost nothing about how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level, and therefore equally little about how developmental processes had evolved. Charles Darwin argued that a shared embryonic structure implied a common ancestor. For example, Darwin cited in his 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; the shrimp-like larva of the barnacle, whose sessile adults looked nothing like other arthropods; Linnaeus and Cuvier had classified them as molluscs. Darwin also noted Alexander Kowalevsky&#x27;s finding that the tunicate, too, was not a mollusc, but in its larval stage had a notochord and pharyngeal slits which developed from the same germ layers as the equivalent structures in vertebrates, and should therefore be grouped with them as chordates.

19th century zoology thus converted embryology into an evolutionary science, connecting phylogeny with homologies between the germ layers of embryos. Zoologists including Fritz Müller proposed the use of embryology to discover phylogenetic relationships between taxa. Müller demonstrated that crustaceans shared the Nauplius larva, identifying several parasitic species that had not been recognized as crustaceans. Müller also recognized that natural selection must act on larvae, just as it does on adults, giving the lie to recapitulation, which would require larval forms to be shielded from natural selection. Two of Haeckel&#x27;s other ideas about the evolution of development have fared better than recapitulation: he argued in the 1870s that changes in the timing (heterochrony) and changes in the positioning within the body (heterotopy) of aspects of embryonic development would drive evolution by changing the shape of a descendant&#x27;s body compared to an ancestor&#x27;s. It took a century before these ideas were shown to be correct.

In 1917, D&#x27;Arcy Thompson wrote a book on the shapes of animals, showing with simple mathematics how small changes to parameters, such as the angles of a gastropod&#x27;s spiral shell, can radically alter an animal&#x27;s form, though he preferred a mechanical to evolutionary explanation. But without molecular evidence, progress stalled.

In 1952, Alan Turing published his paper &quot;The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis&quot;, on the development of patterns in animals&#x27; bodies. He suggested that morphogenesis could be explained by a reaction–diffusion system, a system of reacting chemicals able to diffuse through the body. He modelled catalysed chemical reactions using partial differential equations, showing that patterns emerged when the chemical reaction produced both a catalyst (A) and an inhibitor (B) that slowed down production of A. If A and B then diffused at different rates, A dominated in some places, and B in others. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had run experiments with similar results, but was unable to publish them because scientists thought at that time that creating visible order violated the second law of thermodynamics.

===The modern synthesis of the early 20th century===
In the so-called modern synthesis of the early 20th century, between 1918 and 1930 Ronald Fisher brought together Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, with its insistence on natural selection, heredity, and variation, and Gregor Mendel&#x27;s laws of genetics into a coherent structure for evolutionary biology. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism&#x27;s body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: but it did not explain embryology. Sean B. Carroll has commented that had evo-devo&#x27;s insights been available, embryology would certainly have played a central role in the synthesis.

The evolutionary embryologist Gavin de Beer anticipated evolutionary developmental biology in his 1930 book &quot;Embryos and Ancestors&quot;, by showing that evolution could occur by heterochrony, such as in the retention of juvenile features in the adult. This, de Beer argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in the fossil record, since embryos fossilise poorly. As the gaps in the fossil record had been used as an argument against Darwin&#x27;s gradualist evolution, de Beer&#x27;s explanation supported the Darwinian position. However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved.

===The lac operon===


In 1961, Jacques Monod, Jean-Pierre Changeux and François Jacob discovered the lac operon in the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. It was a cluster of genes, arranged in a feedback control loop so that its products would only be made when &quot;switched on&quot; by an environmental stimulus. One of these products was an enzyme that splits a sugar, lactose; and lactose itself was the stimulus that switched the genes on. This was a revelation, as it showed for the first time that genes, even in organisms as small as a bacterium, are subject to precise control. The implication was that many other genes were also elaborately regulated.

===The birth of evo-devo and a second synthesis===
In 1977, a revolution in thinking about evolution and developmental biology began, with the arrival of recombinant DNA technology in genetics, the book &quot;Ontogeny and Phylogeny&quot; by Stephen J. Gould and the paper &quot;Evolution and Tinkering&quot; by François Jacob. Gould laid to rest Haeckel&#x27;s interpretation of evolutionary embryology, while Jacob set out an alternative theory. 
This led to a second synthesis, at last including embryology as well as molecular genetics, phylogeny, and evolutionary biology to form evo-devo. In 1978, Edward B. Lewis discovered homeotic genes that regulate embryonic development in &quot;Drosophila&quot; fruit flies, which like all insects are arthropods, one of the major phyla of invertebrate animals. 
Bill McGinnis quickly discovered homeotic gene sequences, homeoboxes, in animals in other phyla, in vertebrates such as frogs, birds, and mammals; they were later also found in fungi such as yeasts, and in plants. There were evidently strong similarities in the genes that controlled development across all the eukaryotes.
In 1980, Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus described gap genes which help to create the segmentation pattern in fruit fly embryos; they and Lewis won a Nobel Prize for their work in 1995.

Later, more specific similarities were discovered: for example, the distal-less gene was found in 1989 to be involved in the development of appendages or limbs in fruit flies, the fins of fish, the wings of chickens, the parapodia of marine annelid worms, the ampullae and siphons of tunicates, and the tube feet of sea urchins. It was evident that the gene must be ancient, dating back to the last common ancestor of bilateral animals (before the Ediacaran Period, which began some 635 million years ago). Evo-devo had started to uncover the ways that all animal bodies were built during development.

==The control of body structure==

===Deep homology===
Roughly spherical eggs of different animals give rise to unique morphologies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe does not have a gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development of different features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.

The puzzle of how embryonic development was controlled began to be solved using the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; as a model organism. The step-by-step control of its embryogenesis was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green fluorescent protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.

Using such a technique, in 1994 Walter Gehring found that the &quot;pax-6&quot; gene, vital for forming the eyes of fruit flies, exactly matches an eye-forming gene in mice and humans. The same gene was quickly found in many other groups of animals, such as squid, a cephalopod mollusc. Biologists including Ernst Mayr had believed that eyes had arisen in the animal kingdom at least 40 times, as the anatomy of different types of eye varies widely. For example, the fruit fly&#x27;s compound eye is made of hundreds of small lensed structures (ommatidia); the human eye has a blind spot where the optic nerve enters the eye, and the nerve fibres run over the surface of the retina, so light has to pass through a layer of nerve fibres before reaching the detector cells in the retina, so the structure is effectively &quot;upside-down&quot;; in contrast, the cephalopod eye has the retina, then a layer of nerve fibres, then the wall of the eye &quot;the right way around&quot;. The evidence of &quot;pax-6&quot;, however, was that the same genes controlled the development of the eyes of all these animals, suggesting that they all evolved from a common ancestor. Ancient genes had been conserved through millions of years of evolution to create dissimilar structures for similar functions, demonstrating deep homology between structures once thought to be purely analogous. This notion was later extended to the evolution of embryogenesis and has caused a radical revision of the meaning of homology in evolutionary biology.

===Gene toolkit===

A small fraction of the genes in an organism&#x27;s genome control the organism&#x27;s development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the &quot;Hox&quot; genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.
Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva. &quot;Pax-6&quot;, already mentioned, is a classic toolkit gene. Although other toolkit genes are involved in establishing the plant bodyplan, homeobox genes are also found in plants, implying they are common to all eukaryotes.

===The embryo&#x27;s regulatory networks===


The protein products of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of pleiotropy, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular cis-regulatory elements. For example, while a non-pleiotropic rhodopsin gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element just a few hundred base pairs long, the pleiotropic eyeless cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs. The regulatory networks involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls &quot;scores to hundreds&quot; of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each. All this complexity enables genes involved in the development of the embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.

Such a cascading regulatory network has been studied in detail in the development of the fruit fly embryo. The young embryo is oval in shape, like a rugby ball. A small number of genes produce messenger RNAs that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the embryo. In the early embryo, the &quot;bicoid&quot; and &quot;hunchback&quot; genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give pattern to the future head and thorax; the &quot;caudal&quot; and &quot;nanos&quot; genes are at high concentration near the posterior end, and give pattern to the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of &quot;caudal&quot; messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later switches on genes which create the fly&#x27;s hindmost segments, but only at the posterior end where it is most concentrated.

The Bicoid, Hunchback and Caudal proteins in turn regulate the transcription of gap genes such as &quot;giant&quot;, &quot;knirps&quot;, &quot;Krüppel&quot;, and &quot;tailless&quot; in a striped pattern, creating the first level of structures that will become segments. The proteins from these in turn control the pair-rule genes, which in the next stage set up 7 bands across the embryo&#x27;s long axis. Finally, the segment polarity genes such as &quot;engrailed&quot; split each of the 7 bands into two, creating 14 future segments.

This process explains the accurate conservation of toolkit gene sequences, which has resulted in deep homology and functional equivalence of toolkit proteins in dissimilar animals (seen, for example, when a mouse protein controls fruit fly development). The interactions of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements, or of signalling proteins and receptors, become locked in through multiple usages, making almost any mutation deleterious and hence eliminated by natural selection.

The mechanism that sets up every animal&#x27;s front-back axis is the same, implying a common ancestor. There is a similar mechanism for the back-belly axis for bilaterian animals, but it is reversed between arthropods and vertebrates. Another process, gastrulation of the embryo, is driven by Myosin II molecular motors, which are not conserved across species. The process may have been started by movements of sea water in the environment, later replaced by the evolution of tissue movements in the embryo.

==The origins of novelty==
Among the more surprising and, perhaps, counterintuitive (from a neo-Darwinian viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology is that the diversity of body plans and morphology in organisms across many phyla are not necessarily reflected in diversity at the level of the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: &quot;where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change&quot;. So, if the observed morphological novelty between different clades does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by mutation), where does it come from? Novelty may arise by mutation-driven changes in gene regulation.

===Variations in the toolkit===
Variations in the toolkit may have produced a large part of the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways. A toolkit gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin&#x27;s large ground-finch was enlarged by the &quot;BMP&quot; gene, or when snakes lost their legs as &quot;distal-less&quot; became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form their limbs. Or, a toolkit gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, &quot;distal-less&quot;, which controls such diverse structures as the mandible in vertebrates, legs and antennae in the fruit fly, and eyespot pattern in butterfly wings. Given that small changes in toolbox genes can cause significant changes in body structures, they have often enabled the same function convergently or in parallel. &quot;distal-less&quot; generates wing patterns in the butterflies &quot;Heliconius erato&quot; and &quot;Heliconius melpomene&quot;, which are Müllerian mimics. In so-called facilitated variation, their wing patterns arose in different evolutionary events, but are controlled by the same genes. Developmental changes can contribute directly to speciation.

===Consolidation of epigenetic changes===

Evolutionary innovation may sometimes begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by changes at the gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early in the history of multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.

===Developmental bias===


Development in specific lineages can be biased either positively, towards a given trajectory or phenotype, or negatively, away from producing certain types of change; either may be absolute (the change is always or never produced) or relative. Evidence for any such direction in evolution is however hard to acquire and can also result from developmental constraints that limit diversification. For example, in the gastropods, the snail-type shell is always built as a tube that grows both in length and in diameter; selection has created a wide variety of shell shapes such as flat spirals, cowries and tall turret spirals within these constraints. Among the centipedes, the Lithobiomorpha always have 15 trunk segments as adults, probably the result of a developmental bias towards an odd number of trunk segments. Another centipede order, the Geophilomorpha, the number of segments varies in different species between 27 and 191, but the number is always odd, making this an absolute constraint; almost all the odd numbers in that range are occupied by one or another species.

==Ecological evolutionary developmental biology==
Ecological evolutionary developmental biology, informally known as eco-evo-devo, integrates research from developmental biology and ecology to examine their relationship with evolutionary theory. Researchers study concepts and mechanisms such as developmental plasticity, epigenetic inheritance, genetic assimilation, niche construction and symbiosis.

<text>Przewalski&#x27;s horse ( ; (); ; Equus ferus przewalskii or Equus przewalskii), also called the takhi (), Mongolian wild horse or Dzungarian horse, is a rare and endangered horse originally native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is named after the Russian geographer and explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky. Once extinct in the wild, since the 1990s it has been reintroduced to its native habitat in Mongolia in the Khustain Nuruu National Park, Takhin Tal Nature Reserve, and Khomiin Tal, as well as several other locales in Central Asia and Eastern Europe.

Several genetic characteristics of Przewalski&#x27;s horse differ from what is seen in modern domestic horses, indicating neither is an ancestor of the other. For example, Przewalski&#x27;s horse has 33 chromosome pairs, compared to 32 for the domestic horse. Their ancestral lineages split from a common ancestor between 160,000 and 38,000 years ago, long before the domestication of the horse. Przewalski&#x27;s horse was long considered the only remaining truly wild horse, in contrast with the American mustang and the Australian brumby, which are instead feral horses descended from domesticated animals. That status was called into question when domestic horses of the 5,000-year-old Botai culture of Central Asia were found to be more closely related to Przewalski&#x27;s horses than to &quot;E. f. caballus&quot;. The study raised the possibility that modern Przewalski&#x27;s horses could be the feral descendants of the domestic Botai horses. However, it remains possible that both the Botai horses and the modern Przewalski&#x27;s horses descend separately from the same ancient wild Przewalski&#x27;s horse population. Its taxonomic position is still debated, with some taxonomists treating Przewalski&#x27;s horse as a species, &quot;E. przewalskii&quot;, others as a subspecies of wild horse (&quot;E. ferus przewalskii&quot;) or a variety of the domesticated horse (&quot;E. caballus&quot;).

Przewalski&#x27;s horse is stockily built, smaller, and shorter than its domesticated relatives. Typical height is about , and the average weight is around . They have a dun coat with &quot;pangaré&quot; features and often have dark primitive markings.

==Taxonomy==
Przewalski&#x27;s horse was formally described as a novel species in 1881 by Ivan Semyonovich Polyakov. The taxonomic position of Przewalski&#x27;s horse remains controversial, and no consensus exists about whether it is a full species (as &quot;Equus przewalskii&quot;); a subspecies of &quot;Equus ferus&quot; the wild horse (as &quot;Equus ferus przewalskii&quot; in trinomial nomenclature, along with two other subspecies, the domestic horse &quot;E. f. caballus&quot;, and the extinct tarpan &quot;E. f. ferus&quot;); or even a subpopulation of the domestic horse. The American Society of Mammalogists considers Przewalski&#x27;s horse and the tarpan both to be subspecies of &quot;Equus ferus&quot;, and classifies the domestic horse as a separate species, &quot;Equus caballus&quot;.

==Lineage==
Genetic analysis shows that the takhi and the domestic horse differ significantly, with neither ancestral to the other. The evolutionary divergence of the two populations was estimated to have occurred about 72,000–38,000 years ago, well before domestication, most likely due to climate, topography, or other environmental changes.

According to a 2009 study, the earliest known domestic horses were found at settlements of the Botai culture, from about 5500 years ago. These horses were raised for meat and milk. In 2018, a new study indicated ancient horses of the Botai culture are related to takhis, not to domestic horses as was previously thought. Specifically, the Botai horses appeared to be ancestral to the modern takhi, because all seven takhis nested within the phylogenetic tree of the 20 Botai horses. No comparison was made to definitively wild early takhis. The authors posit that modern Przewalski&#x27;s horses are feral descendants of the ancient Botai domesticated animals, rather than representing a surviving population of never-domesticated horses. Another geneticist pointed out that Przewalski&#x27;s horses may have simply descended from the same wild population that the Botai horses came from, which would still be compatible with the findings of the study.

In 2021, William Taylor and Christina Barron-Ortiz disputed the evidence for domestication of Przewalski&#x27;s horse. Their case was rejected by Alan Outram and colleagues in a paper which was not dated or peer-reviewed. Taylor reiterated his arguments that Przewalski&#x27;s horse had never been domesticated in an article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 2024.

In any case, the Botai horses were found to have negligible genetic contribution to any of the ancient or modern domestic horses studied, indicating that the domestication of the latter was independent, involving a different wild population, from any possible domestication of Przewalski&#x27;s horse by the Botai culture.

==Characteristics==

Przewalski&#x27;s horse is stockily built in comparison to domesticated horses, with shorter legs, and is much smaller and shorter than its domesticated relatives. Typical height is about , and length is about . It weighs around . The coat is generally dun in color with &quot;pangaré&quot; features, varying from dark brown around the mane, to pale brown on the flanks, and yellowish-white on the belly, as well as around the muzzle. The legs of Przewalski&#x27;s horse are often faintly striped, also typical of primitive markings. The mane stands erect and does not extend as far forward, while the tail is about long, with a longer dock and shorter hair than seen in domesticated horses. The hooves of Przewalski&#x27;s horse are longer in the front and have significantly thicker sole horns than feral horses, an adaptation that improves hoof performance on terrain.

===Genomics===
The karyotype of Przewalski&#x27;s horse differs from that of the domestic horse, having 33 chromosome pairs versus 32, apparently due to a fission of a large chromosome ancestral to domestic horse chromosome 5 to produce Przewalski&#x27;s horse chromosomes 23 and 24, though conversely, a Robertsonian translocation that fused two chromosomes ancestral to those seen in Przewalski&#x27;s horse to produce the single large domestic horse chromosome has also been proposed.

Many smaller inversions, insertions and other rearrangements were observed between the chromosomes of domestic and Przewalski&#x27;s horses, while there was much lower heterozygosity in Przewalski&#x27;s horses, with extensive segments devoid of genetic diversity, a consequence of the recent severe bottleneck of the captive Przewalski&#x27;s horse population. In comparison, the chromosomal differences between domestic horses and zebras include numerous large-scale translocations, fusions, inversions, and centromere repositioning. Przewalski&#x27;s horse has the highest diploid chromosome number among all equine species. They can interbreed with the domestic horse and produce fertile offspring, with 65 chromosomes.

The mitochondrial genome has 37 genes that are 99.63% identical to that of the domestic horse.

==Ecology and behavior==
Przewalski reported the horses forming troops of between five and fifteen members, consisting of a mature stallion, his mares and foals. Modern reintroduced populations similarly form family groups of one adult stallion, one to three mares, and their common offspring that stay in the family group until they are no longer dependent, usually at two or three years old. Young females join other harems, while bachelor stallions as well as old stallions who have lost their harems join bachelor groups. Family groups can join to form a herd that moves together.

The patterns of their daily lives exhibit horse behavior similar to that of feral horse herds. Stallions herd, drive, and defend all members of their family, while the mares often display leadership in the family. Stallions and mares stay with their preferred partners for years. While behavioral synchronization is high among mares, stallions other than the main harem stallion are generally less stable in this respect.

Home range in the wild is little studied, but estimated as in the Hustai National Park and in the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area. The ranges of harems are separated, but slightly overlapping. They have few modern predators, but one of the few is the Himalayan wolf.

Horses maintain visual contact with their family and herd at all times, and have a host of ways to communicate with one another, including vocalizations, scent marking, and a wide range of visual and tactile signals. Each kick, groom, tilt of the ear, or other contact with another horse is a means of communicating. This constant communication leads to complex social behaviors among Przewalski&#x27;s horses.

The historical population was said to have lived in the &quot;wildest parts of the desert&quot; with a preference for &quot;especially saline districts&quot;. They were observed mostly during spring and summer at natural wells, migrating to them by crossing valleys rather than by way of higher mountains.

===Diet===

Przewalski horse&#x27;s diet consists of vegetation. Many plant species are in a typical Przewalski&#x27;s horse environment, including: &quot;Elymus repens&quot;, &quot;Carex &quot;spp., Fabaceae, and Asteraceae.
Looking at the species&#x27; diet overall, Przewalski&#x27;s horses most often eat &quot;E. repens&quot;, &quot;Trifolium pratense&quot;, &quot;Vicia cracca&quot;, &quot;Poa trivialis&quot;, &quot;Dactylis glomerata&quot;, and &quot;Bromus inermis&quot;.

While the horses eat a variety of different plant species, they tend to favor different species at different times of year. In the springtime, they favor &quot;Elymus repens&quot;, &quot;Corynephorus canescens&quot;, &quot;Festuca valesiaca,&quot; and &quot;Chenopodium album&quot;. In early summer, they favor &quot;Dactylis glomerata&quot; and &quot;Trifolium&quot;, and in late summer, they gravitate towards &quot;E. repens&quot; and &quot;Vicia cracca&quot;.

In winter the horses eat &quot;Salix &quot;spp., &quot;Pyrus communis&quot;, &quot;Malus sylvatica&quot;, &quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;, &quot;Rosa&quot; spp., and &quot;Alnus&quot; spp. Additionally, Przewalski&#x27;s horses may dig for &quot;Festuca&quot; spp., &quot;Bromus inermis&quot;, and &quot;E. repens&quot; that grow beneath the ice and snow. Their winter diet is very similar to the winter diet of domestic horses, but differs from that revealed by isotope analysis of the historical (pre-captivity) population, which switched in winter to browsing shrubs, though the difference may be due to the extreme habitat pressure the historical population was under. In the wintertime, they eat their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Przewalski&#x27;s horses seasonally display a set of changes collectively characteristic of physiologic adaptation to starvation, with their basal metabolic rate in winter being half what it is during springtime. This is not a direct consequence of decreased nutrient intake, but rather a programmed response to predictable seasonal dietary fluctuation.

===Reproduction===
Mating occurs in late spring or early summer. Mating stallions do not start looking for mating partners until the age of five. Stallions assemble groups of mares or challenge the leader of another group for dominance. Females are able to give birth at the age of three and have a gestation period of 11–12 months. Foals are able to stand about an hour after birth. The rate of infant mortality among foals is 25%, with 83.3% of these deaths resulting from leading stallion infanticide. Foals begin grazing within a few weeks but are not weaned for 8–13 months after birth. They reach sexual maturity at two years of age.

==Population==
===History===

Przewalski&#x27;s-type wild horses appear in European cave art dating as far back as 20,000 years ago, but genetic investigation of a 35,870-year-old specimen from one such cave instead showed an affinity with extinct Iberian horse lineage and the modern domestic horse, suggesting that it was not Przewalski&#x27;s horse being depicted in this art. Horse skeletons dating to the fifth to the third millennia BCE, found in Central Asia, with a range extending to the southern Urals and the Altai, belong to the genetic lineage of Przewalski&#x27;s horse. Of particular note are the horses of this lineage found in the archaeological sites of the Chalcolithic Botai culture. Sites dating from the mid-fourth-millennium BCE show evidence of horse domestication. Analysis of ancient DNA from Botai horse specimens from about 3000 BCE reveals them to have DNA markers consistent with the lineage of modern Przewalski&#x27;s horses.

There are sporadic reports of Przewalski&#x27;s horse in the historical record before its formal characterization. The Buddhist monk Bodowa wrote a description of what is thought to have been Przewalski&#x27;s horse about AD 900, and an account from 1226 reports an incident involving wild horses during Genghis Khan&#x27;s campaign against the Tangut empire. In the fifteenth century, Johann Schiltberger recorded one of the first European sightings of the horses in the journal recounting his trip to Mongolia as a prisoner of the Mongol Khan. Another was recorded as a gift to the Manchurian emperor around 1630, its value as a gift suggesting a difficulty in obtaining them. John Bell, a Scottish doctor in service to Peter the Great from 1719 to 1722, observed a horse in Russia&#x27;s Tomsk Oblast that was apparently this species, and a few decades later in 1750, a large hunt with thousands of beaters organized by the Manchurian emperor killed between two and three hundred of these horses.

The species is named after a Russian colonel of Polish descent, Nikolai Przhevalsky (1839–1888) (Nikołaj Przewalski in Polish). An explorer and naturalist, he obtained the skull and hide of an animal shot in 1878 in the Gobi near today&#x27;s China–Mongolia border. He would travel to the Dzungarian Basin to observe it in the wild. In 1881, the horse received a formal scientific description and was named &quot;Equus przevalskii&quot; by Ivan Semyonovich Polyakov, based on Przewalski&#x27;s collection and description, while in 1884, the sole exemplar of the horse in Europe was a preserved specimen in the Museum of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. This was supplemented in 1894 when the brothers Grum-Grzhimailo returned several hides and skulls to St. Petersburg and described the horse&#x27;s behavior in the wild. A number of these horses were captured around 1900 by Carl Hagenbeck and placed in zoos, and these, along with one later captive, reproduced to give rise to today&#x27;s population.

After 1903, there were no reports of the wild population until 1947, when several isolated groups were observed and a lone filly captured. Although local herdsmen reported seeing as many as 50 to 100 takhis grazing in small groups then, there were only sporadic sightings of single groups of two or three animals after that, mostly near natural wells. Two scientific expeditions in 1955 and 1962 failed to find any. After herders and naturalists reported single harem groups in 1966 and 1967, the last observation of the wild horse in its native habitat was of a single stallion in 1969. Expeditions after this failed to locate any horses, and the species would be designated &quot;extinct in the wild&quot; for over 30 years. Competition with livestock, hunting, capture of foals for zoological collections, military activities, and harsh winters recorded in 1945, 1948, and 1956 are considered to be main causes of the decline in Przewalski&#x27;s horse population.

The wild population was already rare at its first scientific characterization. Przewalski reported seeing them only from a distance and may have instead sighted herds of local onager Mongolian wild asses. He was only able to obtain specimens of the type from Kirghiz hunters. The range of Przewalski&#x27;s horse was limited to the arid Dzungarian Basin in the Gobi Desert. It has been suggested that this was not their natural habitat, but, like the onager, they were a steppe animal driven to this barren last refuge by the dual pressures of hunting and habitat loss to agricultural grazing. There were two distinct populations recognized by local Mongolians, a lighter steppe variety and a darker mountain one. This distinction is seen in early twentieth-century descriptions. Their mountainous habitat included the &quot;Takhiin Shar Nuruu&quot; (The Yellow Wild-Horse Mountain Range). In their last decades in the wild, the remnant population was limited to the small region between the Takhiin Shar Nuruu and Bajtag-Bogdo mountain ridges.

===Captivity===

Attempts to obtain specimens for exhibit and captive breeding were largely unsuccessful until 1902, when 28 captured foals were brought to Europe. These and a small number of additional captives would be distributed among zoos and breeding centers in Europe and the United States. Many facilities failed in their attempts at captive breeding, but a few programs were established. However, by the mid-1930s, inbreeding had caused reduced fertility, and the captive population experienced a genetic bottleneck, with the surviving captive breeding stock descended from only 11 of the founder captives. In addition, in at least one instance, the progeny of interbreeding with a domestic horse was bred back into the captive Przewalski&#x27;s horse population. However, recent studies have shown only minimal genetic contribution of this domestic horse to the captive population.

The situation was improved when the exchange of breeding animals among facilities increased genetic diversity and there was a consequent improvement in fertility, but the population experienced another genetic bottleneck when many of the horses failed to survive World War II. The most valuable group, in Askania Nova, Ukraine, was shot by German soldiers during World War II occupation, and the group in the United States had died out. Only two captive populations in zoos remained, in Munich and in Prague, and of the 31 remaining horses at war&#x27;s end, only 9 became ancestors of the subsequent captive population. By the end of the 1950s, only 12 individual horses were left in the world&#x27;s zoos.

A wild-caught mare captured as a foal a decade earlier was introduced into the Ukrainian captive population in 1957. This would prove the last wild-caught horse, and with the presumed extinction of the wild population, last sighted in Mongolia in the late 1960s, the captive population became the sole representatives of Przewalski&#x27;s horse. Genetic diversity received a much-needed boost from this new source, with the spread of her bloodline through the inbred captive groups leading to their increased reproductive success, and by 1965, there were more than 130 animals spread among thirty-two zoos and parks.

===Conservation efforts===
In 1977, the Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse was founded in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, by Jan and Inge Bouman. The foundation started a program of exchange between captive populations in zoos worldwide to reduce inbreeding and later began its own breeding program. As a result of such efforts, the extant herd has retained a far greater genetic diversity than its genetic bottleneck made likely. By 1979, when this concerted program of population management to maximize genetic diversity was begun, there were almost four hundred horses in sixteen facilities, a number that had grown by the early 1990s to over 1,500.

While dozens of zoos worldwide have Przewalski&#x27;s horses in small numbers, specialized reserves are also dedicated primarily to the species. The world&#x27;s largest captive-breeding program for Przewalski&#x27;s horses is at the Askania Nova preserve in Ukraine. From 1998, thirty-one horses were also released in the unenclosed Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine and Belarus. People evacuated the zone after the Chernobyl accident, so now it serves as a deserted &quot;de facto&quot; nature reserve. Though poaching has taken a toll on numbers, as of 2019 the estimated population in the Chernobyl zone was over 100 individuals.

Le Villaret, located in the Cevennes National Park in southern France and run by the Association Takh, is a breeding site for Przewalski&#x27;s horses that was created to allow the free expression of natural Przewalski&#x27;s horse behaviors. In 1993, eleven zoo-born horses were brought to Le Villaret. Horses born there are adapted to life in the wild, free to choose their mates, and required to forage independently. This was intended to produce individuals capable of being reintroduced into Mongolia. In 2012, 39 individuals were at Le Villaret. An intensely researched population of free-ranging animals was also introduced to the Hortobágy National Park &quot;puszta&quot; in Hungary; data on social structure, behavior, and diseases gathered from these animals are used to improve the Mongolian conservation effort. An additional breeding population of Przewalski&#x27;s horses roams the former Döberitzer Heide military proving ground, now a nature reserve in Dallgow-Döberitz, Germany. Established in 2008, this population comprised 24 horses in 2019. Another population is being established in the Iberian System in Spain, the first free-roaming Przewalski’s horses in Western Europe.

In 2024, a Colorado rancher discovered what appears to be a critically endangered Przewalski&#x27;s horse at a Kansas livestock auction, mistakenly identified as a mule. Another similar horse was found at a Utah sanctuary. Genetic tests suggest both are Przewalski&#x27;s horses, raising concerns about how they ended up in U.S. auctions. The owners care for the animals but hope they can eventually join professional conservation programs.

===Reintroduction===

The Przewalski&#x27;s Horse Reintroduction Project of China was initiated in 1985 when 11 wild horses were imported from overseas. After more than two decades of effort, the Xinjiang Wild Horse Breeding Centre has bred a large number of horses, 55 of which were released into the Kalamely Mountain area. The animals quickly adapted to their new environment. In 1988, six foals were born and survived, and by 2001, over 100 horses were at the centre. , the center hosted 127 horses divided into 13 breeding herds and three bachelor herds. 

Reintroductions organized by Western European countries started in the 1990s. Several populations have now been released into the wild. A cooperative venture between the Zoological Society of London and Mongolian scientists has successfully reintroduced these horses from zoos into their natural habitat in Mongolia. In 1992, 16 horses were released into the wild in Mongolia, followed by additional animals later. One of the areas to which they were reintroduced became Khustain Nuruu National Park in 1998. Another reintroduction site is Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area, located at the fringes of the Gobi Desert. 

In 2001, Przewalski&#x27;s horses were reintroduced into the Kalamaili Nature Reserve in Xinjiang, China. 

Since 2004, there has been a program to reintroduce Przewalski&#x27;s horses that were bred in France into Mongolia. Instrumental to that 2004 reintroduction was Claudia Feh, a Swiss equine specialist and conservation biologist, Feh led an effort to bring together animals that zoos had conserved to create a breeding population in southern France. Then, after it was established, three family groups were relocated to Khovd in western Mongolia. At a site on the northern edge of the Gobi Desert, Feh worked in cooperation with local people to ensure the horses survived and flourished. For this work, Feh received a Rolex Award in 2004.

In 2004 and 2005, 22 horses were released by the Association Takh to a third reintroduction site in the buffer zone of the Khar Us Nuur National Park, in the northern edge of the Gobi ecoregion. In the winter of 2009–2010, one of the worst &quot;dzud&quot; or snowy winter conditions ever hit Mongolia. The population of Przewalski&#x27;s horse in the Great Gobi B SPA was drastically affected, providing clear evidence of the risks associated with reintroducing small and sequestered species in unpredictable and unfamiliar environments. 

After reintroduced horses had successfully reproduced, the status of the animal was changed from &quot;extinct in the wild&quot; to &quot;endangered&quot; in 2005, while on the IUCN Red List they were reclassified from &quot;extinct in the wild&quot; to &quot;critically endangered&quot;, after a reassessment in 2008, and from &quot;critically endangered&quot; to &quot;endangered&quot; after a 2011 reassessment. 

In 2011, Prague Zoo started a new project, Return of the Wild Horses. With the support of public and many strategic partners, yearly transports of captive-bred horses into the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area continued. , an estimated total of almost 400 horses existed in three free-ranging populations in the wild. Prague Zoo has transported horses to Mongolia in several rounds in cooperation with partners (Czech Air Force, European Breeding Programme for Przewalski&#x27;s Horses, Association pour le cheval de Przewalski: Takh, Czech Development Agency, Czech Embassy in Mongolia, and others). The zoo has the longest uninterrupted history of breeding Przewalski&#x27;s horses in the world and keeps the studbook of this species. 

The first reintroduction into the Orenburg region on the Russian steppe occurred in 2016. 

In May 2023, a herd of ten Przewalski&#x27;s horses obtained from Monts D&#x27;Azur Biological Reserve in France was introduced by Rewilding Europe to the Iberian Highlands rewilding landscape in Spain, near Villanueva de Alcorón. Following an acclimatization period, the horses were released into the reserve proper in September. This introduction was intended to address the buildup of dense scrub caused by the decrease in traditional sheep grazing due to rural depopulation. The horses are intended to fill a niche similar to that of the extinct European wild horse and of contemporary domesticated herbivores by opening the landscape through low-intensity grazing and browsing, thereby enhancing biodiversity and lowering the risk of forest fires. Future introductions are planned. 

In June 2024 six mares and a stallion were reintroduced to Kazakhstan from zoos in Europe, ten years after plans were announced to do so. The operation was organised by Prague Zoo, which selected horses from various programs in Europe, which were housed at Tierpark Berlin for some months before being transported to Kazakhstan in Czech army planes.

===Assisted reproduction and cloning===

In the earlier decades of captivity, the insular breeding by individual zoos led to inbreeding and reduced fertility. In 1979, several American zoos began a collaborative breeding-exchange program to maximize genetic diversity. Recent advances in equine reproductive science have also been used to preserve and expand the gene pool. Scientists at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Zoo successfully reversed a vasectomy on a Przewalski horse in 2007—the first operation of its kind on this species, and possibly the first ever on any endangered species. While normally, a vasectomy may be performed on an endangered animal under limited circumstances, particularly if an individual has already produced many offspring and its genes are overrepresented in the population, scientists realized the animal in question was one of the most genetically valuable Przewalski&#x27;s horses in the North American breeding program. The first birth by artificial insemination occurred on 27 July 2013 at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.

In 2020, the first cloned Przewalski&#x27;s horse was born, the result of a collaboration between San Diego Zoo Global, ViaGen Equine and Revive &amp; Restore. The cloning was carried out by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), whereby a viable embryo is created by transplanting the DNA-containing nucleus of a somatic cell into an immature egg cell (oocyte) that has had its nucleus removed, producing offspring genetically identical to the somatic cell donor. Since the oocyte used was from a domestic horse, this was an example of interspecies SCNT.

The somatic cell donor was a Przewalski horse stallion named Kuporovic, born in the UK in 1975 and relocated three years later to the US, where he died in 1998. Due to concerns over the loss of genetic variation in the captive Przewalski&#x27;s horse population, and in anticipation of the development of new cloning techniques, tissue from the stallion was cryopreserved at the San Diego Zoo&#x27;s Frozen Zoo. Breeding of this individual in the 1980s had already substantially increased the genetic diversity of the captive population after he was discovered to have more unique alleles than any other horse living at the time, including otherwise lost genetic material from two of the original captive founders. To produce the clone, frozen skin fibroblasts were thawed, and grown in cell culture. An oocyte was collected from a domestic horse, and its nucleus replaced by a nucleus collected from a cultured Przewalski&#x27;s horse fibroblast. The resulting embryo was induced to begin division. It was cultured until it reached the blastocyst stage, then implanted into a domestic horse surrogate mare, which carried the embryo to term and delivered a foal with the Przewalski horse DNA of the long-deceased stallion.

The cloned horse was named Kurt, after Dr. Kurt Benirschke, a geneticist who developed the idea of cryopreserving genetic material from species considered to be endangered. His ideas led to creating the Frozen Zoo as a genetic library. In 2021, Kurt was relocated to the breeding herd at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. In order to integrate him into the existing herd, Kurt was partnered with a young female named Holly, a few months older than him, in order to allow him to learn the social and communication behaviors of wild Przewalski&#x27;s horses. On reaching maturity at three to four years of age, Kurt is intended to become the breeder stallion for the San Diego Zoo herd to pass Kuporovic&#x27;s genes into the larger captive Przewalski&#x27;s horse population and thereby increase the genetic variation of the species.

In 2023, a genetic twin of Kurt, named Ollie, was born from cloning with the help of the San Diego Zoo Global Frozen Zoo. It is the first reported case of any endangered species having more than one clone successfully produced. This individual eventually joins Kurt and Holly at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. Due to having been conceived through the transfer of a somatic cell nucleus into an egg cell obtained from a domestic horse donor, Kurt and Ollie both display the mithocondrial genome of domestic horses instead of belonging to a Przewlaski horse mithocondrial clade.

<text>Capsaicin (8-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) (, rarely ) is an active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging to the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot;. It is a potent irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related amides (capsaicinoids) are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, likely as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi. Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic, colorless, highly pungent (i.e., spicy) crystalline solid.

== Natural function ==
Capsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes and, to a lesser extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot;. The seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith of the inner wall, where the seeds are attached.

The seeds of &quot;Capsicum&quot; plants are dispersed predominantly by birds. In birds, the TRPV1 channel does not respond to capsaicin or related chemicals, but mammalian TRPV1 is very sensitive to it. This is advantageous to the plant, as chili pepper seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and can germinate later, whereas mammals have molar teeth that destroy such seeds and prevent them from germinating. Thus, natural selection may have led to increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it disperse. There is also evidence that capsaicin may have evolved as an anti-fungal agent. The fungal pathogen &quot;Fusarium&quot;, which is known to infect wild chilies and thereby reduce seed viability, is deterred by capsaicin, which thus limits this form of predispersal seed mortality.

The vanillotoxin-containing venom of a certain tarantula species (&quot;Psalmopoeus cambridgei)&quot; activates the same pathway of pain as is activated by capsaicin, an example of a shared pathway in both plant and animal anti-mammalian defense.

==Uses==
===Food===

Because of the burning sensation caused by capsaicin when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, it is commonly used in food products to provide added spiciness or &quot;heat&quot; (piquancy), usually in the form of spices such as chili powder and paprika. In high concentrations, capsaicin will also cause a burning effect on other sensitive areas, such as skin or eyes. The degree of heat found within a food is often measured on the Scoville scale.

There has long been a demand for capsaicin-spiced products like chili pepper, and hot sauces such as Tabasco sauce and Mexican salsa. It is common for people to experience pleasurable and even euphoric effects from ingesting capsaicin. Folklore among self-described &quot;s&quot; attribute this to pain-stimulated release of endorphins, a different mechanism from the local receptor overload that makes capsaicin effective as a topical analgesic.

===Research and pharmaceutical use===
Capsaicin is used as an analgesic in topical ointments and dermal patches to relieve pain, typically in concentrations between 0.025% and 0.1%. It may be applied in cream form for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with arthritis, backache, strains and sprains, often in compounds with other rubefacients.

It is also used to reduce the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as post-herpetic neuralgia caused by shingles. A capsaicin transdermal patch (&quot;Qutenza&quot;) for the management of this particular therapeutic indication (pain due to post-herpetic neuralgia) was approved in 2009, as a therapeutic by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Union. A subsequent application to the FDA for Qutenza to be used as an analgesic in HIV neuralgia was refused. One 2017 review of clinical studies having limited quality found that high-dose topical capsaicin (8%) compared with control (0.4% capsaicin) provided moderate to substantial pain relief from post-herpetic neuralgia, HIV-neuropathy, and diabetic neuropathy.

Although capsaicin creams have been used to treat psoriasis for reduction of itching, a review of six clinical trials involving topical capsaicin for treatment of pruritus concluded there was insufficient evidence of effect. Oral capsaicin decreases LDL cholesterol levels moderately.

There is insufficient clinical evidence to determine the role of ingested capsaicin on several human disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

===Pepper spray and pests===
Capsaicinoids are also an active ingredient in riot control and personal defense pepper spray agents. When the spray comes in contact with skin, especially eyes or mucous membranes, it produces pain and breathing difficulty in the affected individual.

Capsaicin is also used to deter pests, specifically mammalian pests. Targets of capsaicin repellants include voles, deer, rabbits, squirrels, bears, insects, and attacking dogs. Ground or crushed dried chili pods may be used in birdseed to deter rodents, taking advantage of the insensitivity of birds to capsaicin. The Elephant Pepper Development Trust claims that using chili peppers as a barrier crop can be a sustainable means for rural African farmers to deter elephants from eating their crops.

An article published in the &quot;Journal of Environmental Science and Health Part B&quot; in 2006 states that &quot;Although hot chili pepper extract is commonly used as a component of household and garden insect-repellent formulas, it is not clear that the capsaicinoid elements of the extract are responsible for its repellency.&quot;

The first pesticide product using solely capsaicin as the active ingredient was registered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1962.

===Equestrian sports===
Capsaicin is a banned substance in equestrian sports because of its hypersensitizing and pain-relieving properties. At the show jumping events of the 2008 Summer Olympics, four horses tested positive for capsaicin, which resulted in disqualification.

==Irritant effects==
===Acute health effects===
Capsaicin is a strong irritant requiring proper protective goggles, respirators, and proper hazardous material-handling procedures. Capsaicin takes effect upon skin contact (irritant, sensitizer), eye contact (irritant), ingestion, and inhalation (lung irritant, lung sensitizer). The in mice is 47.2 mg/kg.

Painful exposures to capsaicin-containing peppers are among the most common plant-related exposures presented to poison centers. They cause burning or stinging pain to the skin and, if ingested in large amounts by adults or small amounts by children, can produce nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and burning diarrhea. Eye exposure produces intense tearing, pain, conjunctivitis, and blepharospasm.

===Treatment after exposure===
The primary treatment is removal of the offending substance. Plain water is ineffective at removing capsaicin. Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items.

When capsaicin is ingested, cold milk may be an effective way to relieve the burning sensation due to caseins in milk, and the water of milk acts as a surfactant, allowing the capsaicin to form an emulsion with it.

===Weight loss and regain===
As of 2007, there was no evidence showing that weight loss is directly correlated with ingesting capsaicin. Well-designed clinical research had not been performed because the pungency of capsaicin in prescribed doses under research prevented subjects from complying in the study. A 2014 meta-analysis of further trials found weak evidence that consuming capsaicin before a meal might slightly reduce the amount of food consumed, and might drive food preference toward carbohydrates.

===Peptic ulcer ===
One 2006 review concluded that capsaicin may relieve symptoms of a peptic ulcer rather than being a cause of it.

===Death===
Ingestion of high quantities of capsaicin can be deadly, particularly in people with heart problems. Even healthy young people can suffer adverse health effects like myocardial infarction after ingestion of capsaicin capsules.

==Mechanism of action==
The burning and painful sensations associated with capsaicin result from &quot;defunctionalization&quot; of nociceptor nerve fibers by causing a topical hypersensitivity reaction in the skin. As a member of the vanilloid family, capsaicin binds to a receptor on nociceptor fibers called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1). TRPV1, which can also be stimulated with heat, protons and physical abrasion, permits cations to pass through the cell membrane when activated. The resulting depolarization of the neuron stimulates it to send impulses to the brain. By binding to TRPV1 receptors, capsaicin produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, such as warming, tingling, itching, or stinging, explaining why capsaicin is described as an irritant on the skin and eyes or by ingestion.

Clarifying the mechanisms of capsaicin effects on skin nociceptors was part of awarding the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, as it led to the discovery of skin sensors for temperature and touch, and identification of the single gene causing sensitivity to capsaicin.

==History==
The compound was first extracted in impure form in 1816 by Christian Friedrich Bucholz (1770–1818).
In 1873 German pharmacologist Rudolf Buchheim (1820–1879) and in 1878 the Hungarian doctor Endre Hőgyes stated that &quot;capsicol&quot; (partially purified capsaicin) caused the burning feeling when in contact with mucous membranes and increased secretion of gastric acid.

==Capsaicinoids==

The most commonly occurring capsaicinoids are capsaicin (69%), dihydrocapsaicin (22%), nordihydrocapsaicin (7%), homocapsaicin (1%), and homodihydrocapsaicin (1%).

Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin (both 16.0 million SHU) are the most pungent capsaicinoids. Nordihydrocapsaicin (9.1 million SHU), homocapsaicin and homodihydrocapsaicin (both 8.6 million SHU) are about half as hot.

There are six natural capsaicinoids (table below). Although vanillylamide of n-nonanoic acid (Nonivamide, VNA, also PAVA) is produced synthetically for most applications, it does occur naturally in &quot;Capsicum&quot; species.

==Biosynthesis==

=== History ===
The general biosynthetic pathway of capsaicin and other capsaicinoids was elucidated in the 1960s by Bennett and Kirby, and Leete and Louden. Radiolabeling studies identified phenylalanine and valine as the precursors to capsaicin. Enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), caffeic acid &quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase (COMT) and their function in capsaicinoid biosynthesis were identified later by Fujiwake et al., and Sukrasno and Yeoman. Suzuki et al. are responsible for identifying leucine as another precursor to the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. It was discovered in 1999 that pungency of chili peppers is related to higher transcription levels of key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, caffeic acid &quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase. Similar studies showed high transcription levels in the placenta of chili peppers with high pungency of genes responsible for branched-chain fatty acid pathway.

===Biosynthetic pathway===
Plants exclusively of the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot; produce capsaicinoids, which are alkaloids. Capsaicin is believed to be synthesized in the interlocular septum of chili peppers and depends on the gene &quot;AT3&quot;, which resides at the &quot;pun1&quot; locus, and which encodes a putative acyltransferase.

Biosynthesis of the capsaicinoids occurs in the glands of the pepper fruit where capsaicin synthase condenses vanillylamine from the phenylpropanoid pathway with an acyl-CoA moiety produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway.

Capsaicin is the most abundant capsaicinoid found in the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot;, but at least ten other capsaicinoid variants exist. Phenylalanine supplies the precursor to the phenylpropanoid pathway while leucine or valine provide the precursor for the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. To produce capsaicin, 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-CoA is produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway and condensed with vanillylamine. Other capsaicinoids are produced by the condensation of vanillylamine with various acyl-CoA products from the branched-chain fatty acid pathway, which is capable of producing a variety of acyl-CoA moieties of different chain length and degrees of unsaturation. All condensation reactions between the products of the phenylpropanoid and branched-chain fatty acid pathway are mediated by capsaicin synthase to produce the final capsaicinoid product.

== Evolution ==
The &quot;Capsicum&quot; genus split from &quot;Solanaceae&quot; 19.6 million years ago, 5.4 million years after the appearance of &quot;Solanaceae&quot;, and is native only to the Americas. Chilies only started to quickly evolve in the past 2 million years into markedly different species. This evolution can be partially attributed to a key compound found in peppers, 8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide, otherwise known as capsaicin. Capsaicin evolved similarly across species of chilies that produce capsaicin. Its evolution over the course of centuries is due to genetic drift and natural selection, across the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot;. Despite the fact that chilies within the &quot;Capsicum&quot; genus are found in diverse environments, the capsaicin found within them all exhibit similar properties that serve as defensive and adaptive features. Capsaicin evolved to preserve the fitness of peppers against fungi infections, insects, and granivorous mammals.

=== Antifungal properties ===
Capsaicin acts as an antifungal agent in four primary ways. First, capsaicin inhibits the metabolic rate of the cells that make up the fungal biofilm. This inhibits the area and growth rate of the fungus, since the biofilm creates an area where a fungus can grow and adhere to the chili in which capsaicin is present. Capsaicin also inhibits fungal hyphae formation, which impacts the amount of nutrients that the rest of the fungal body can receive. Thirdly, capsaicin disrupts the structure of fungal cells and the fungal cell membranes. This has consequential negative impacts on the integrity of fungal cells and their ability to survive and proliferate. Additionally, the ergosterol synthesis of growing fungi decreases in relation to the amount of capsaicin present in the growth area. This impacts the fungal cell membrane, and how it is able to reproduce and adapt to stressors in its environment.

=== Insecticidal properties ===
Capsaicin deters insects in multiple ways. The first is by deterring insects from laying their eggs on the pepper due to the effects capsaicin has on these insects. Capsaicin can cause intestinal dysplasia upon ingestion, disrupting insect metabolism and causing damage to cell membranes within the insect. This in turn disrupts the standard feeding response of insects.

=== Seed dispersion and deterrents against granivorous mammals ===
Granivorous mammals pose a risk to the propagation of chilies because their molars grind the seeds of chilies, rendering them unable to grow into new chili plants. As a result, modern chilies evolved defense mechanisms to mitigate the risk of granivorous mammals. While capsaicin is present at some level in every part of the pepper, the chemical has its highest concentration in the tissue near the seeds within chilies. Birds are able to eat chilies, then disperse the seeds in their excrement, enabling propagation.

=== Adaptation to varying moisture levels ===
Capsaicin is a potent defense mechanism for chilies, but it does come at a cost. Varying levels of capsaicin in chilies currently appear to be caused by an evolutionary split between surviving in dry environments, and having defense mechanisms against fungal growth, insects, and granivorous mammals. Capsaicin synthesis in chilies places a strain on their water resources. This directly affects their fitness, as it has been observed that standard concentration of capsaicin of peppers in high moisture environments in the seeds and pericarps of the peppers reduced the seeds production by 50%.

<doc id="57425" wikidata="Q14712" url="?curid=57425" title="Drupe">
<text>In botany, a drupe (or stone fruit) is a type of fruit in which an outer fleshy part (exocarp, or skin, and mesocarp, or flesh) surrounds a single shell (the &quot;pip&quot; (UK), &quot;pit&quot; (US), &quot;stone&quot;, or &quot;pyrena&quot;) of hardened endocarp with a seed (&quot;kernel&quot;) inside. Drupes do not split open to release the seed, i.e., they are indehiscent. These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions). 

The definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, woody (lignified) stone is derived from the ovary wall of the flower. In an aggregate fruit, which is composed of small, individual drupes (such as a raspberry), each individual is termed a drupelet, and may together form an aggregate fruit. Such fruits are often termed &quot;berries&quot;, although botanists use a different definition of &quot;berry&quot;. Other fleshy fruits may have a stony enclosure that comes from the seed coat surrounding the seed, but such fruits are not drupes.

Flowering plants that produce drupes include coffee, jujube, mango, olive, most palms (including açaí, date, sabal and oil palms), pistachio, white sapote, cashew, and all members of the genus &quot;Prunus&quot;, including the almond, apricot, cherry, damson, peach, nectarine, and plum.

The term drupaceous is applied to a fruit having the structure and texture of a drupe, but which does not precisely fit the definition of a drupe.

==Terminology==
The boundary between a drupe and a berry is not always clear. Thus, some sources describe the fruit of species from the genus &quot;Persea&quot;, which includes the avocado, as a drupe, others describe avocado fruit as a berry. One definition of &quot;berry&quot; requires the endocarp to be less than thick, other fruits with a stony endocarp being drupes. In marginal cases, terms such as &quot;drupaceous&quot; or &quot;drupe-like&quot; may be used.

The term stone fruit (also stonefruit) can be a synonym for drupe or, more typically, it can mean just the fruit of the genus &quot;Prunus&quot;.

Freestone refers to a drupe having a stone which can be removed from the flesh with ease. The flesh is not attached to the stone and does not need to be cut to free the stone. Freestone varieties of fruits are preferred for uses that require careful removal of the stone, especially if removal will be done by hand. Freestone plums are preferred for making homegrown prunes, and freestone sour cherries are preferred for making pies and cherry soup.

Clingstone refers to a drupe having a stone which cannot be easily removed from the flesh. The flesh is attached strongly to the stone and must be cut to free the stone. Clingstone varieties of fruits in the genus &quot;Prunus&quot; are preferred as table fruit and for jams, because the flesh of clingstone fruits tends to be more tender and juicy throughout.

Tryma is a specialized term for such nut-like drupes that are difficult to categorize. Hickory nuts (&quot;Carya&quot;) and walnuts (&quot;Juglans&quot;) in the Juglandaceae family grow within an outer husk; these fruits are technically drupes or drupaceous nuts, thus are not true botanical nuts.

==Ecology==
Many drupes, with their sweet, fleshy outer layer, attract the attention of animals as a food, and the plant population benefits from the resulting dispersal of its seeds. The endocarp (pit or stone) is sometimes dropped after the fleshy part is eaten, but is often swallowed, passing through the digestive tract, and returned to the soil in feces with the seed inside unharmed. This passage through the digestive tract can reduce the thickness of the endocarp, thus can aid in germination rates. The process is known as scarification.

==Examples==
Typical drupes include apricots, olives, loquat, peaches, plums, cherries, mangoes, pecans, and amlas (Indian gooseberries). Other examples include sloe (&quot;Prunus spinosa&quot;) and ivy (&quot;Hedera helix&quot;).

The coconut is also a drupe, but the mesocarp is fibrous or dry (termed a &quot;husk&quot;), so this type of fruit is classified as a simple dry, fibrous drupe. Unlike other drupes, the coconut seed is so large that it is unlikely to be dispersed by being swallowed by fauna, but it can float extremely long distances—across oceans.

Bramble fruits such as the blackberry and the raspberry are aggregates of drupelets. The fruit of blackberries and raspberries comes from a single flower whose pistil is made up of a number of free carpels. However, mulberries, which closely resemble blackberries, are not aggregate fruit, but are multiple fruits, actually derived from bunches of catkins, each drupelet thus belonging to a different flower.

Certain drupes occur in large clusters, as in the case of palm species, where a large array of drupes is found in a cluster. Examples of such large drupe clusters include dates, &quot;Jubaea chilensis&quot; in central Chile and &quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot; in the Sonoran Desert of North America.

Drupe-like &quot;fruits&quot; are also known in many gymnosperms like cycads, ginkgos and some cypresses.

<doc id="57445" wikidata="Q312348" url="?curid=57445" title="Thurgood Marshall">
<text>Thoroughgood &quot;Thurgood&quot; Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an American civil rights lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1967 until 1991. He was the Supreme Court&#x27;s first African-American justice. Prior to his judicial service, he was an attorney who fought for civil rights, leading the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Marshall was a prominent figure in the movement to end racial segregation in American public schools. He won 29 of the 32 civil rights cases he argued before the Supreme Court, culminating in the Court&#x27;s landmark 1954 decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which rejected the separate but equal doctrine and held segregation in public education to be unconstitutional. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court in 1967. A staunch liberal, he frequently dissented as the Court became increasingly conservative.

Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Marshall attended Lincoln University and the Howard University School of Law. At Howard, he was mentored by Charles Hamilton Houston, who taught his students to be &quot;social engineers&quot; willing to use the law to fight for civil rights. Marshall opened a law practice in Baltimore but soon joined Houston at the NAACP in New York. They worked together on the segregation case of &quot;Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada&quot;; after Houston returned to Washington, Marshall took his place as special counsel of the NAACP, and he became director-counsel of the newly formed NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He participated in numerous landmark Supreme Court cases involving civil rights, including &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot;, &quot;Morgan v. Virginia&quot;, &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;, &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot;, &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;, &quot;Brown&quot;, and &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot;. His approach to desegregation cases emphasized the use of sociological data to show that segregation was inherently unequal.

In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where he favored a broad interpretation of constitutional protections. Four years later, Johnson appointed him as the U.S. Solicitor General. In 1967, Johnson nominated Marshall to replace Justice Tom C. Clark on the Supreme Court; despite opposition from Southern senators, he was confirmed by a vote of 69 to 11. He was often in the majority during the consistently liberal Warren Court period, but after appointments by President Richard Nixon made the Court more conservative, Marshall frequently found himself in dissent. His closest ally on the Court was Justice William J. Brennan Jr., and the two voted the same way in most cases.

Marshall&#x27;s jurisprudence was pragmatic and drew on his real-world experience. His most influential contribution to constitutional doctrine, the &quot;sliding-scale&quot; approach to the Equal Protection Clause, called on courts to apply a flexible balancing test instead of a more rigid tier-based analysis. He fervently opposed the death penalty, which in his view constituted cruel and unusual punishment; he and Brennan dissented in more than 1,400 cases in which the majority refused to review a death sentence. He favored a robust interpretation of the First Amendment in decisions such as &quot;Stanley v. Georgia&quot;, and he supported abortion rights in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and other cases. Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 and was replaced by Clarence Thomas. He died in 1993.

==Early life and education==
Thurgood Marshall was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Norma and William Canfield Marshall. His father held various jobs as a waiter in hotels, in clubs, and on railroad cars, and his mother was an elementary school teacher. The family moved to New York City in search of better employment opportunities not long after Thurgood&#x27;s birth; they returned to Baltimore when he was six years old. He was an energetic and boisterous child who frequently found himself in trouble. Following legal cases was one of William&#x27;s hobbies, and Thurgood oftentimes went to court with him to observe the proceedings. Marshall later said that his father &quot;never told me to become a lawyer, but he turned me into one... He taught me how to argue, challenged my logic on every point, by making me prove every statement I made, even if we were discussing the weather.&quot;

Marshall attended the Colored High and Training School (later Frederick Douglass High School) in Baltimore, graduating in 1925 with honors. He then enrolled at Lincoln University in Chester County, Pennsylvania, the oldest college for African Americans in the United States. The mischievous Marshall was suspended for two weeks in the wake of a hazing incident, but he earned good grades in his classes and led the school&#x27;s debating team to numerous victories. His classmates included the poet Langston Hughes. Upon his graduation with honors in 1930 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in American literature and philosophy, Marshall—being unable to attend the all-white University of Maryland Law School—applied to Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C., and was admitted. At Howard, he was mentored by Charles Hamilton Houston, who taught his students to be &quot;social engineers&quot; willing to use the law as a vehicle to fight for civil rights. Marshall graduated in June 1933 ranked first in his class, and he passed the Maryland bar examination later that year.

==Legal career==
Marshall started a law practice in Baltimore, but it was not financially successful, partially because he spent much of his time working for the benefit of the community. He volunteered with the Baltimore branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons (NAACP). In 1935, Marshall and Houston brought suit against the University of Maryland on behalf of Donald Gaines Murray, an African American whose application to the university&#x27;s law school had been rejected on account of his race. In that case—&quot;Murray v. Pearson&quot;—Judge Eugene O&#x27;Dunne ordered that Murray be admitted, and the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that it violated equal protection to admit white students to the law school while keeping blacks from being educated in-state. The decision was never appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States and therefore did not apply nationwide, but it pleased Marshall, who later said that he had filed the lawsuit &quot;to get even with the bastards&quot; who had kept him from attending the school himself.

In 1936, Marshall joined Houston, who had been appointed as the NAACP&#x27;s special counsel, in New York City, serving as his assistant. They worked together on the landmark case of &quot;Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada&quot; (1938)&quot;.&quot; When Lloyd Lionel Gaines&#x27;s application to the University of Missouri&#x27;s law school was rejected on account of his race, he filed suit, arguing that his equal-protection rights had been violated because he had not been provided with a legal education substantially equivalent to that which white students received. After Missouri courts rejected Gaines&#x27;s claims, Houston—joined by Marshall, who helped to prepare the brief—sought review in the U.S. Supreme Court. They did not challenge the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), which had accepted the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine; instead, they argued that Gaines had been denied an equal education. In an opinion by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, the Court held that if Missouri gave whites the opportunity to attend law school in-state, it was required to do the same for blacks.

Houston returned to Washington in 1938, and Marshall assumed his position as special counsel the following year. He also became the director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. (the Inc Fund), which had been established as a separate organization for tax purposes. In addition to litigating cases and arguing matters before the Supreme Court, he was responsible for raising money, managing the Inc Fund, and conducting public-relations work. Marshall litigated a number of cases involving unequal salaries for African Americans, winning nearly all of them; by 1945, he had ended salary disparities in major Southern cities and earned a reputation as a prominent figure in the civil rights movement. He also defended individuals who had been charged with crimes before both trial courts and the Supreme Court. Of the thirty-two civil rights cases that Marshall argued before the Supreme Court, he won twenty-nine. He and W. J. Durham wrote the brief in &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; (1944), in which the Court ruled the white primary unconstitutional, and he successfully argued both &quot;Morgan v. Virginia&quot; (1946), involving segregation on interstate buses, and a companion case to &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; (1948), involving racially restrictive covenants.

From 1939 to 1947, Marshall was a member of the Board of Directors of the American Civil Liberties Union. During that period, he aligned with the faction which favored a more absolutist defense of civil liberties. Most notably, unlike the majority of the Board, he was consistent in his opposition to Roosevelt&#x27;s Executive Order 9066, which put Japanese Americans into concentration camps. Also, in contrast to most of the Board, Marshall charged that the prosecution of thirty-two right wing opponents of Roosevelt&#x27;s pre-war foreign policy in the Sedition Trial of 1944 violated the First Amendment.

In the years after 1945, Marshall resumed his offensive against racial segregation in schools. Together with his Inc Fund colleagues, he devised a strategy that emphasized the inherent educational disparities caused by segregation rather than the physical differences between the schools provided for blacks and whites. The Court ruled in Marshall&#x27;s favor in &quot;Sipuel v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma&quot; (1948), ordering that Oklahoma provide Ada Lois Sipuel with a legal education, although the justices declined to order that she be admitted to the state&#x27;s law school for whites. In 1950, Marshall brought two cases involving education to the Court: &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot;, which was George W. McLaurin&#x27;s challenge to unequal treatment at the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s graduate school, and &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;, which was Heman Sweatt&#x27;s challenge to his being required to attend a blacks-only law school in Texas. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of both McLaurin and Sweatt on the same day; although the justices did not overrule &quot;Plessy&quot; and the separate but equal doctrine, they rejected discrimination against African-American students and the provisions of schools for blacks that were inferior to those provided for whites.

Marshall next turned to the issue of segregation in primary and secondary schools. The NAACP brought suit to challenge segregated schools in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia, arguing both that there were disparities between the physical facilities provided for blacks and whites and that segregation was inherently harmful to African-American children. Marshall helped to try the South Carolina case. He called numerous social scientists and other expert witnesses to testify regarding the harms of segregation; these included the psychology professor Ken Clark, who testified that segregation in schools caused self-hatred among African-American students and inflicted damage that was &quot;likely to endure as long as the conditions of segregation exist&quot;. The five cases eventually reached the Supreme Court and were argued in December 1952. In contrast to the oratorical rhetoric of his adversary—John W. Davis, a former solicitor general and presidential candidate—Marshall spoke plainly and conversationally. He stated that the only possible justification for segregation &quot;is an inherent determination that the people who were formerly in slavery, regardless of anything else, shall be kept as near that stage as possible. And now is the time, we submit, that this Court should make clear that that is not what our Constitution stands for.&quot; On May 17, 1954, after internal disagreements and a 1953 reargument, the Supreme Court handed down its unanimous decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, holding in an opinion by Chief Justice Earl Warren that: &quot;in the field of public education the doctrine of &#x27;separate but equal&#x27; has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.&quot; When Marshall heard Warren read those words, he later said, &quot;I was so happy I was numb&quot;.

The Court in &quot;Brown&quot; ordered additional arguments on the proper remedy for the constitutional violation that it had identified; in &quot;Brown&quot; II, decided in 1955, the justices ordered that desegregation proceed &quot;with all deliberate speed&quot;. Their refusal to set a concrete deadline came as a disappointment to Marshall, who had argued for total integration to be completed by September 1956. In the years following the Court&#x27;s decision, Marshall coordinated challenges to Virginia&#x27;s &quot;massive resistance&quot; to &quot;Brown&quot;, and he returned to the Court to successfully argue &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot; (1958), involving Little Rock&#x27;s attempt to delay integration. Marshall, who according to the legal scholar Mark Tushnet &quot;gradually became a civil rights leader more than a civil rights lawyer&quot;, spent substantial amounts of time giving speeches and fundraising; in 1960, he accepted an invitation from Tom Mboya to help draft Kenya&#x27;s constitution. By that year, Tushnet writes, he had become &quot;the country&#x27;s most prominent Supreme Court advocate&quot;.

== Court of Appeals ==
President John F. Kennedy, who according to Tushnet &quot;wanted to demonstrate his commitment to the interests of African Americans without incurring enormous political costs&quot;, nominated Marshall to be a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on September 23, 1961. The Second Circuit, which spanned New York, Vermont, and Connecticut, was at the time the nation&#x27;s prominent appellate court. When Congress adjourned, Kennedy gave Marshall a recess appointment, and he took the oath of office on October 23.

Even after his recess appointment, Southern senators continued to delay Marshall&#x27;s full confirmation for more than eight months. A subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee postponed his hearing several times, leading Senator Kenneth Keating, a New York Republican, to charge that the three-member subcommittee, which included two pro-segregation Southern Democrats, was biased against Marshall and engaged in unjustifiable delay. The subcommittee held several hearings between May and August 1962; Marshall faced harsh questioning from the Southerners over what the scholar Howard Ball described as &quot;marginal issues at best&quot;. After further delays from the subcommittee, the full Judiciary Committee bypassed it and, by an 11–4 vote on September 7, endorsed Marshall&#x27;s nomination. Following five hours of floor debate, the full Senate confirmed him by a 56–14 vote on September 11, 1962.

On the Second Circuit, Marshall authored 98 majority opinions, none of which was reversed by the Supreme Court, as well as 8 concurrences and 12 dissents. He dissented when a majority held in the Fourth Amendment case of &quot;United States ex rel. Angelet v. Fay&quot; (1964) that the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1961 decision in &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot; (which held that the exclusionary rule applied to the states) did not apply retroactively, writing that the judiciary was &quot;not free to circumscribe the application of a declared constitutional right&quot;. In &quot;United States v. Wilkins&quot; (1964), he concluded that the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s protection against double jeopardy applied to the states; in &quot;People of the State of New York v. Galamison&quot; (1965), he dissented from a ruling upholding the convictions of civil rights protesters at the New York World&#x27;s Fair. Marshall&#x27;s dissents indicated that he favored broader interpretations of constitutional protections than did his colleagues.

== Solicitor General ==
Marshall&#x27;s nomination to the office of Solicitor General was widely viewed as a stepping stone to a Supreme Court appointment. Johnson pressured Southern senators not to obstruct Marshall&#x27;s confirmation, and a hearing before a Senate subcommittee lasted only fifteen minutes; the full Senate confirmed him on August 11, 1965. As Solicitor General, Marshall won fourteen of the nineteen Supreme Court cases he argued. He later characterized the position as &quot;the most effective job&quot; and &quot;maybe the best&quot; job he ever had. Marshall argued in &quot;Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections&quot; (1966) that conditioning the ability to vote on the payment of a poll tax was unlawful; in a companion case to &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; (1966), he unsuccessfully maintained on behalf of the government that federal agents were not always required to inform arrested individuals of their rights. He defended the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in &quot;South Carolina v. Katzenbach&quot; (1966) and &quot;Katzenbach v. Morgan&quot; (1966), winning both cases.

== Supreme Court nomination ==

In February 1967, Johnson nominated Ramsey Clark to be Attorney General. The nominee&#x27;s father was Tom C. Clark, an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Fearing that his son&#x27;s appointment would create substantial conflicts of interest for him, the elder Clark announced his resignation from the Court. For Johnson, who had long desired to nominate a non-white justice, the choice of a nominee to fill the ensuing vacancy &quot;was as easy as it was obvious&quot;, according to the scholar Henry J. Abraham. Although the President briefly considered selecting William H. Hastie (an African-American appellate judge from Philadelphia) or a female candidate, he decided to choose Marshall. Johnson announced the nomination in the White House Rose Garden on June 13, declaring that Marshall &quot;deserves the appointment... I believe that it is the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place.&quot;

The public received the nomination favorably, and Marshall was praised by prominent senators from both parties. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings for five days in July. Marshall faced harsh criticism from such senators as Mississippi&#x27;s James O. Eastland, North Carolina&#x27;s Sam Ervin Jr., Arkansas&#x27;s John McClellan, and South Carolina&#x27;s Strom Thurmond, all of whom opposed the nominee&#x27;s liberal jurisprudence. In what &quot;Time&quot; magazine characterized as a &quot;Yahoo-type hazing&quot;, Thurmond asked Marshall over sixty questions about various minor aspects of the history of certain constitutional provisions. By an 11–5 vote on August 3, the committee recommended that Marshall be confirmed. On August 30, after six hours of debate, senators voted 69–11 to confirm Marshall to the Supreme Court. He took the constitutional oath of office on October 2, 1967, becoming the first African American to serve as a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

== Supreme Court ==
Marshall remained on the Supreme Court for nearly twenty-four years, serving until his retirement in 1991. The Court to which he was appointed—the Warren Court—had a consistent liberal majority, and Marshall&#x27;s jurisprudence was similar to that of its leaders, Chief Justice Warren and Justice William J. Brennan Jr. Although he wrote few major opinions during this period due to his lack of seniority, he was typically in the majority. As a result of four Supreme Court appointments by President Richard Nixon, however, the liberal coalition vanished. The Court under Chief Justice Warren Burger (the Burger Court) was not as conservative as some observers had anticipated, but the task of constructing liberal majorities case-by-case was left primarily to Brennan; Marshall&#x27;s most consequential contributions to constitutional law came in dissent. The justice left much of his work to his law clerks, preferring to determine the outcome of the case and then allow the clerks to draft the opinion themselves. He took umbrage at frequent claims that he did no work and spent his time watching daytime soap operas; according to Tushnet, who clerked for Marshall, the idea that he &quot;was a lazy Justice uninterested in the Court&#x27;s work... is wrong and perhaps racist&quot;. Marshall&#x27;s closest colleague and friend on the Court was Brennan, and the two justices agreed so often that their clerks privately referred to them as &quot;Justice Brennanmarshall&quot;. He also had a high regard for Warren, whom he described as &quot;probably the greatest Chief Justice who ever lived&quot;.

Marshall consistently sided with the Supreme Court&#x27;s liberal bloc. According to the scholar William J. Daniels: &quot;His approach to justice was Warren Court–style legal realism... In his dissenting opinions he emphasized individual rights, fundamental fairness, equal opportunity and protection under the law, the supremacy of the Constitution as the embodiment of rights and privileges, and the Supreme Court&#x27;s responsibility to play a significant role in giving meaning to the notion of constitutional rights.&quot; Marshall&#x27;s jurisprudence was pragmatic and relied on his real-world experience as a lawyer and as an African American. He disagreed with the notion (favored by some of his conservative colleagues) that the Constitution should be interpreted according to the Founders&#x27; original understandings; in a 1987 speech commemorating the Constitution&#x27;s bicentennial, he said:

=== Equal protection and civil rights ===
As the Court became increasingly conservative, Marshall found himself dissenting in numerous cases regarding racial discrimination. When the majority held in &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; that a lower court had gone too far in ordering busing to reduce racial imbalances between schools in Detroit, he dissented, criticizing his colleagues for what he viewed as a lack of resolve to implement desegregation even when faced with difficulties and public resistance. In a dissent in &quot;City of Memphis v. Greene&quot; that according to Tushnet &quot;demonstrated his sense of the practical reality that formed the context for abstract legal issues&quot;, he argued that a street closure that made it more difficult for residents of an African-American neighborhood to reach a city park was unconstitutional because it sent &quot;a plain and powerful symbolic message&quot; to blacks &quot;that because of their race, they are to stay out of the all-white enclave... and should instead take the long way around&quot;. Marshall felt that affirmative action was both necessary and constitutional; in an opinion in &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot;, he commented that it was &quot;more than a little ironic that, after several hundred years of class-based discrimination against Negroes, the Court is unwilling to hold that a class-based remedy for that discrimination is permissible&quot;. Dissenting in &quot;City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.&quot;, he rejected the majority&#x27;s decision to strike down an affirmative-action program for government contractors, stating that he did &quot;not believe that this Nation is anywhere close to eradicating racial discrimination or its vestiges&quot;.

Marshall&#x27;s most influential contribution to constitutional doctrine was his &quot;sliding-scale&quot; approach to the Equal Protection Clause, which posited that the judiciary should assess a law&#x27;s constitutionality by balancing its goals against its impact on groups and rights. Dissenting in &quot;Dandridge v. Williams&quot;, a case in which the majority upheld Maryland&#x27;s $250-a-month cap on welfare payments against claims that it was insufficient for large families, he argued that rational basis review was not appropriate in cases involving &quot;the literally vital interests of a powerless minority&quot;. In what Cass Sunstein described as the justice&#x27;s greatest opinion, Marshall dissented when the Court in &quot;San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez&quot; upheld a system in which local schools were funded mainly through property taxes, arguing that the policy (which meant that poorer school districts obtained less money than richer ones) resulted in unconstitutional discrimination. His dissent in &quot;Harris v. McRae&quot;, in which the Court upheld the Hyde Amendment&#x27;s ban on the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions, rebuked the majority for applying a &quot;relentlessly formalistic catechism&quot; that failed to take account of the amendment&#x27;s &quot;crushing burden on indigent women&quot;. Although Marshall&#x27;s sliding-scale approach was never adopted by the Court as a whole, the legal scholar Susan Low Bloch comments that &quot;his consistent criticism seems to have prodded the Court to somewhat greater flexibility&quot;.

=== Criminal procedure and capital punishment ===
Marshall supported the Warren Court&#x27;s constitutional decisions on criminal law, and he wrote the opinion of the Court in &quot;Benton v. Maryland&quot;, which held that the Constitution&#x27;s prohibition of double jeopardy applied to the states. After the retirements of Warren and Justice Hugo Black, however, &quot;Marshall was continually shocked at the refusal&quot; of the Burger and Rehnquist Courts &quot;to hold police and those involved in the criminal justice system responsible for acting according to the language and the spirit of fundamental procedural guarantees&quot;, according to Ball. He favored a strict interpretation of the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s warrant requirement and opposed rulings that made exceptions to that provision; in &quot;United States v. Ross&quot;, for instance, he indignantly dissented when the Court upheld a conviction that was based on evidence discovered during a warrantless search of containers that had been found in an automobile. Marshall felt strongly that the &quot;Miranda&quot; doctrine should be expanded and fully enforced. In cases involving the Sixth Amendment, he argued that defendants must have competent attorneys; dissenting in &quot;Strickland v. Washington&quot;, Marshall (parting ways with Brennan) rejected the majority&#x27;s conclusion that defendants must prove prejudice in ineffective assistance of counsel cases.

Marshall fervently opposed capital punishment throughout his time on the Court, arguing that it was cruel and unusual and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. He was the only justice with considerable experience defending those charged with capital crimes, and he expressed concern about the fact that injustices in death-penalty cases could not be remedied, often commenting: &quot;Death is so lasting.&quot; In &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, a case in which the Court struck down the capital-punishment statutes that were in force at the time, Marshall wrote that the death penalty was &quot;morally unacceptable to the people of the United States at this time in their history&quot; and that it &quot;falls upon the poor, the ignorant, and the underprivileged members of society&quot;. When the Court in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; upheld new death-penalty laws that required juries to consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances, he dissented, describing capital punishment as a &quot;vestigial savagery&quot; that was immoral and violative of the Eighth Amendment. Afterwards, Marshall and Brennan dissented in every instance in which the Court declined to review a death sentence, filing more than 1,400 dissents that read: &quot;Adhering to our views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, we would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.&quot;

=== First Amendment ===
According to Ball, Marshall felt that the rights protected by the First Amendment were the Constitution&#x27;s most important principles and that they could be restricted only for extremely compelling reasons. In a 1969 opinion in &quot;Stanley v. Georgia&quot;, he held that it was unconstitutional to criminalize the possession of obscene material. For the Court, he reversed the conviction of a Georgia man charged with possessing pornography, writing: &quot;If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch.&quot; In &quot;Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 400 v. Logan Valley Plaza&quot;, he wrote for the Court that protesters had the right to picket on private property that was open to the public—a decision that was effectively overruled (over Marshall&#x27;s dissent) four years later in &quot;Lloyd Corporation v. Tanner&quot;. He emphasized equality in his free speech opinions, writing in &quot;Chicago Police Dept. v. Mosley&quot; that &quot;above all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its messages, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content&quot;. Making comparisons to earlier civil rights protests, Marshall vigorously dissented in &quot;Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence&quot;, a case in which the Court ruled that the government could forbid homeless individuals from protesting poverty by sleeping overnight in Lafayette Park; although Burger decried their claims as &quot;frivolous&quot; attempts to &quot;trivialize&quot; the Constitution, Marshall argued that the protesters were engaged in constitutionally protected symbolic speech.

Marshall joined the majority in &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot; and &quot;United States v. Eichman&quot;, two cases in which the Court held that the First Amendment protected the right to burn the American flag. He favored the total separation of church and state, dissenting when the Court upheld in &quot;Lynch v. Donnelly&quot; a city&#x27;s display of a nativity scene and joining the majority in &quot;Wallace v. Jaffree&quot; to strike down an Alabama law regarding prayer in schools. On the issue of the free exercise of religion, Marshall voted with the majority in &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot; to hold that a school attendance law could not be constitutionally applied to the Amish, and he joined Justice Harry Blackmun&#x27;s dissent when the Court in &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot; upheld a restriction on religious uses of peyote and curtailed &quot;Sherbert v. Verner&quot;&#x27;s strict scrutiny standard. In the view of J. Clay Smith Jr. and Scott Burrell, the justice was &quot;an unyielding supporter of civil liberties&quot;, whose &quot;commitment to the values of the First Amendment was enhanced from actually realizing the historical consequences of being on the weaker and poorer side of power&quot;.

=== Privacy ===
In Marshall&#x27;s view, the Constitution guaranteed to all citizens the right to privacy; he felt that although the Constitution nowhere mentioned such a right expressly, it could be inferred from various provisions of the Bill of Rights. He joined the majority in &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot; to strike down a statute that prohibited the distribution or sale of contraceptives to unmarried persons, dissented when the Court in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; upheld an anti-sodomy law, and dissented from the majority&#x27;s decision in &quot;Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health&quot; that the Constitution did not protect an unconditional right to die. On the issue of abortion rights, the author Carl T. Rowan comments that &quot;no justice ever supported a woman&#x27;s right to choice as uncompromisingly as Marshall did&quot;. He joined Blackmun&#x27;s opinion for the Court in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which held that the Constitution protected a woman&#x27;s right to have an abortion, and he consistently voted against state laws that sought to limit that right in cases such as &quot;Maher v. Roe&quot;, &quot;H. L. v. Matheson&quot;, &quot;Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health&quot;, &quot;Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists&quot;, and &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot;.

=== Other topics ===
During his service on the Supreme Court, Marshall participated in over 3,400 cases and authored 322 majority opinions. He was a member of the unanimous majority in &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot; that rejected President Nixon&#x27;s claims of absolute executive privilege. Marshall wrote several influential decisions in the fields of corporate law and securities law, including a frequently-cited opinion regarding materiality in &quot;TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.&quot; His opinions involving personal jurisdiction, such as &quot;Shaffer v. Heitner&quot;, were pragmatic and de-emphasized the importance of state boundaries. According to Tushnet, Marshall was &quot;the Court&#x27;s liberal specialist in Native American law&quot;; he endeavored to protect Native Americans from regulatory action on the part of the states. He favored a rigid interpretation of procedural requirements, saying in one case that &quot;rules mean what they say&quot;—a position that in Tushnet&#x27;s view was motivated by the justice&#x27;s &quot;traditionalist streak&quot;.

Like most Supreme Court justices, many of Marshall&#x27;s law clerks went on to become prominent lawyers and legal scholars. His clerks included future Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan, U.S. circuit judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, and legal scholars Cass Sunstein, Mark Tushnet, and Martha Minow.

== Personal life ==
Marshall wed Vivian &quot;Buster&quot; Burey on September 4, 1929, while he was a student at Lincoln University. They remained married until her death from cancer in 1955. Marshall married Cecilia &quot;Cissy&quot; Suyat, an NAACP secretary, eleven months later; they had two children: Thurgood Jr. and John. Thurgood Jr. became an attorney and worked in the Clinton administration, and John directed the U.S. Marshals Service and served as Virginia&#x27;s secretary of public safety.

Marshall was an active member of the Episcopal Church and served as a delegate to its 1964 convention, walking out after a resolution to recognize a right to disobey immoral segregation laws was voted down. He was a Prince Hall Mason, attending meetings and participating in rituals. He refused to attend the Supreme Court&#x27;s annual Christmas party believing that it infringed upon the separation of church and state.

Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, who served with Marshall on the Supreme Court for a decade, wrote that &quot;it was rare during our conference deliberations that he would not share an anecdote, a joke or a story&quot;; although O&#x27;Connor initially treated the stories as &quot;welcome diversions&quot;, she later &quot;realized that behind most of the anecdotes was a relevant legal point&quot;.

== Retirement, later life, and death ==
Marshall did not wish to retire—he frequently said &quot;I was appointed to a life term, and I intend to serve it&quot;—but he had been in ill health for many years, and Brennan&#x27;s retirement in 1990 left him unhappy and isolated on the Court. The 82-year-old justice announced on June 27, 1991, that he would retire. When asked at a press conference what was wrong with him that would cause him to leave the Court, he replied: &quot;What&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot; with me? I&#x27;m old. I&#x27;m getting old and coming apart!&quot;

President George H. W. Bush (whom Marshall loathed) nominated Clarence Thomas, a rightist who had served in the Reagan and Bush administrations, to replace Marshall. His retirement took effect on October 1.

Marshall served as a visiting judge on the Second Circuit for a week in January 1992, and he received the American Bar Association&#x27;s highest award in August of that year. His health continued to deteriorate, and, on January 24, 1993, at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center, he died of heart failure. He was 84 years old.

Marshall lay in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court, and thousands thronged there to pay their respects; more than four thousand attended his funeral service at the National Cathedral. The civil rights leader Vernon E. Jordan said that Marshall had &quot;demonstrat[ed] that the law could be an instrument of liberation&quot;, while Chief Justice William Rehnquist gave a eulogy in which he said: &quot;Inscribed above the front entrance to the Supreme Court building are the words &#x27;Equal justice under law&#x27;. Surely no one individual did more to make these words a reality than Thurgood Marshall.&quot; Marshall was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

== Appraisal and legacy ==
According to the scholar Daniel Moak, Marshall &quot;profoundly shaped the political direction of the United States&quot;, &quot;transformed constitutional law&quot;, and &quot;opened up new facets of citizenship to black Americans&quot;. For Tushnet, he was &quot;probably the most important American lawyer of the twentieth century&quot;; in the view of the political scientist Robert C. Smith, he was &quot;one of the greatest leaders in the history of the African-American struggle for freedom and equality&quot;. A 1999 survey of black political scientists listed Marshall as one of the ten greatest African-American leaders in history; panelists described him as the &quot;greatest jurist of the twentieth century&quot; and stated that he &quot;spearheaded the creation of the legal foundations of the civil rights movement&quot;. Scholars of the Supreme Court have not rated Marshall as highly as some of his colleagues: although his pre–Supreme Court legal career and his staunch liberalism have met with broad approval, a perception that he lacked substantial influence over his fellow justices has harmed his reputation. In Abraham&#x27;s view, &quot;he was one of America&#x27;s greatest public lawyers, but he was not a great Supreme Court justice&quot;. A 1993 survey of legal scholars found that Marshall was ranked as the seventeenth-greatest justice of the Supreme Court—a rating that, while still lower than that of his fellow liberal justices, was substantially higher than was recorded in an earlier survey.

Marshall has received numerous tributes. The state of Maryland renamed Baltimore&#x27;s airport the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport in 2005, and the University of Maryland&#x27;s law library is named in his honor. Buildings named for Marshall include New York&#x27;s 590-foot-high Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse (renamed in 2001), where he heard cases as an appellate judge, and the federal judicial center in Washington. He is the namesake of streets and schools throughout the nation. Marshall posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1993, and the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp in his honor in 2003. He was depicted by Sidney Poitier in the 1991 television movie &quot;Separate but Equal&quot;, by Laurence Fishburne in George Stevens Jr.&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Thurgood&quot;, and by Chadwick Boseman in the 2017 film &quot;Marshall&quot;.

<text>Charlotte ( ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of North Carolina and the county seat of Mecklenburg County. The population was 874,579 at the 2020 census, making Charlotte the 15th-most populous city in the United States, the seventh-most populous city in the South, and the second-most populous city in the Southeast behind Jacksonville, Florida. Charlotte is the cultural, economic, and transportation center of the Charlotte metropolitan area, whose estimated 2023 population of 2,805,115 ranked 22nd in the United States. The Charlotte metropolitan area is part of an 18-county market region and combined statistical area with an estimated population of 3,387,115 as of 2023.

Between 2004 and 2014, Charlotte was among the country&#x27;s fastest-growing metropolitan areas, with 888,000 new residents. Based on U.S. census data from 2005 to 2015, Charlotte tops the U.S. in millennial population growth. Throughout the 2020s, it has remained one of the fastest-growing major cities in the United States. Residents of Charlotte are referred to as &quot;Charlotteans&quot;.

Charlotte is home to the corporate headquarters of Bank of America, Honeywell, Truist Financial, and the East Coast headquarters of Wells Fargo, which, when combined with other Charlotte-based financial institutions, makes the city the second-largest banking center in the nation.

Charlotte&#x27;s notable attractions include three professional sports teams, the Carolina Panthers of the NFL, the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA, and Charlotte FC of MLS. The city is also home to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, Opera Carolina, Charlotte Symphony, Charlotte Ballet, Children&#x27;s Theatre of Charlotte, Mint Museum, Harvey B. Gantt Center, Bechtler Museum of Modern Art, the Billy Graham Library, Levine Museum of the New South, Charlotte Museum of History, Carowinds amusement park, and U.S. National Whitewater Center.

Charlotte has a humid subtropical climate. It is located several miles east of the Catawba River and southeast of Lake Norman, the largest human-made lake in North Carolina. Lake Wylie and Mountain Island Lake are two smaller human-made lakes located near the city. As of 2024, 66% of the city&#x27;s area is occupied by green spaces. The city ranks 1st in the United States and 29th in the world in the ranking of the greenest cities on the planet.

==History==
===Early history===

The Catawba Indians were the first known historic tribe to settle Mecklenburg County in the Charlotte area and were first recorded around 1567, according to Spanish records.

===18th century===
By 1759, half the Catawba tribe had died from smallpox, an endemic disease among European colonists, which the Catawba had no natural immunity against. At the time of their largest population, the Catawba population was 10,000. But by 1826, the Catawba population dropped to 110.

The city of Charlotte was developed first by a wave of migration of Scots-Irish Presbyterians, or Ulster-Scot settlers from Ulster, who dominated the culture of the Southern Piedmont Region and made up the principal founding population in the backcountry. German immigrants also settled in the area before the American Revolutionary War, but in smaller numbers. They still contributed greatly to the early foundations of the region.

Mecklenburg County was initially part of Bath County (1696 to 1729) of the New Hanover Precinct, which became New Hanover County in 1729. The western portion of New Hanover split into Bladen County in 1734, and its western portion split into Anson County in 1750. Mecklenburg County was formed from Anson County in 1762. Further apportionment was made in 1792, after the American Revolutionary War, with Cabarrus County formed from Mecklenburg.

===19th century===
In 1842, Union County formed from Mecklenburg&#x27;s southeastern portion and a western portion of Anson County. These areas were all part of one of the original six judicial/military districts of North Carolina known as the Salisbury District.

The area that is now Charlotte was first settled by European colonists around 1755 when Thomas Spratt and his family settled near what is now the Elizabeth neighborhood. Thomas Polk (great-uncle of President James K. Polk), who later married Thomas Spratt&#x27;s daughter, built his house by the intersection of two Native American trading paths between the Yadkin and Catawba rivers. One path ran north–south and was part of the Great Wagon Road; the second path ran east–west along what is now Trade Street.

Nicknamed the &quot;Queen City&quot;, like its county a few years earlier, Charlotte was named in honor of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who had become the queen consort of Great Britain and Ireland in 1761, seven years before the town&#x27;s incorporation. A second nickname derives from the American Revolutionary War, when British commander General Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis occupied the city but was driven out by hostile residents. He wrote that Charlotte was &quot;a hornet&#x27;s nest of rebellion&quot;, leading to the nickname &quot;The Hornet&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

Within decades of Polk&#x27;s settling, the area grew to become the Town of Charlotte, incorporated in 1768. Though chartered as Charlotte, the name appears as a form of &quot;Charlottesburgh&quot; on many maps until around 1800. A form of &quot;Charlottetown&quot; also appears on maps of British origin depicting General Cornwallis&#x27; route of invasion. The crossroads in Piedmont became the heart of Uptown Charlotte. In 1770, surveyors marked the streets in a grid pattern for future development. The east–west trading path became Trade Street, and the Great Wagon Road became Tryon Street, in honor of William Tryon, a royal governor of colonial North Carolina.
The intersection of Trade and Tryon is commonly known today as &quot;Trade and Tryon&quot;, or simply &quot;The Square&quot;, and formally as &quot;Independence Square&quot;.

While surveying the boundary between the Carolinas in 1772, William Moultrie stopped in Charlotte, whose five or six houses were &quot;very ordinary built of logs&quot;.

Local leaders came together in 1775 and signed the Mecklenburg Resolves, more popularly known as the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. While not a true declaration of independence from British rule, it is among the first such declarations that eventually led to the American Revolution. May 20, the traditional date of the signing of the declaration, is celebrated annually in Charlotte as &quot;MecDec&quot;, with musket and cannon fire by reenactors in Independence Square. North Carolina&#x27;s state flag and state seal also bear the date.

Charlotte is traditionally considered the home of Southern Presbyterianism, but in the 19th century, numerous churches, including Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic formed, eventually giving Charlotte the nickname, &quot;The City of Churches&quot;.

In 1799, in nearby Cabarrus County, 12-year-old Conrad Reed found a 17- pound rock, which his family used as a doorstop. Three years later, a jeweler determined it was nearly solid gold, paying the family a paltry $3.50. The first documented gold find in the United States of any consequence set off the nation&#x27;s first gold rush. Many veins of gold were found in the area throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the 1837 founding of the Charlotte Mint. North Carolina was the chief producer of gold in the United States, until the Sierra Nevada found in 1848, although the volume mined in the Charlotte area was dwarfed by subsequent rushes.

===20th century===

Some groups still pan for gold occasionally in local streams and creeks. The Reed Gold Mine operated until 1912. The Charlotte Mint was active until 1861 when Confederate forces seized it at the outbreak of the Civil War. The mint was not reopened at the war&#x27;s end, but the building, albeit in a different location, now houses the Mint Museum of Art.

The city&#x27;s first boom came after the Civil War, as Charlotte became a cotton processing center and railroad hub. By the 1880s, Charlotte sat astride the Southern Railway mainline from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. Farmers from miles around would bring cotton to the railroad platform in Uptown. Local promotors began building textile factories, starting with the 1881 Charlotte Cotton Mill that still stands at Graham and 5th streets.

Charlotte&#x27;s city population at the 1890 census grew to 11,557.

In 1910, Charlotte surpassed Wilmington to become North Carolina&#x27;s largest city with 34,014 residents.

The population grew again during World War I, when the U.S. government established Camp Greene, north of present-day Wilkinson Boulevard. The camp supported 40,000 soldiers, with many troops and suppliers staying after the war, launching urbanization that eventually overtook older cities along the Piedmont Crescent. In the 1920 census, Charlotte fell to being the state&#x27;s second largest city, Winston-Salem with 48,395 people, had two thousand more people than Charlotte. Charlotte would pass Winston-Salem in population by the 1930 census, and has remained North Carolina&#x27;s largest city since.

Until 1958, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad operated a daily passenger train from its own station (which had opened in 1896) to Wilmington.

The city&#x27;s modern-day banking industry achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, largely under the leadership of financier Hugh McColl. McColl transformed North Carolina National Bank (NCNB) into a formidable national bank that through aggressive acquisitions eventually merged with BankAmerica to become Bank of America. First Union, later Wachovia in 2001, experienced similar growth before it was acquired by San Francisco–based Wells Fargo in 2008. Measured by control of assets, Charlotte became the second largest banking headquarters in the United States after New York City.

On September 22, 1989, the city was hit by Hurricane Hugo. With sustained winds of and gusts of , Hugo caused massive property damage, destroyed 80,000 trees, and knocked out electrical power to most of the population. Residents were without power for weeks, schools were closed for a week or more, and the cleanup took months. The city was caught unprepared; Charlotte is inland, and residents from coastal areas in both Carolinas often wait out hurricanes in Charlotte.

=== 21st century ===
In December 2002, Charlotte and much of central North Carolina were hit by an ice storm that resulted in more than 1.3 million people losing power. During an abnormally cold December, many were without power for weeks. Many of the city&#x27;s Bradford pear trees split apart under the weight of the ice.

In August 2015 and September 2016, the city experienced several days of protests related to the police shootings of Jonathan Ferrell and Keith Scott.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.63%) is water. Charlotte is the twenty-sixth-most expansive city in the United States and lies at an elevation of . Charlotte constitutes most of Mecklenburg County in the Carolina Piedmont. Uptown Charlotte sits atop a long rise between two creeks, Sugar Creek and Irwin Creek, and was built on the gunnies of the St. Catherine&#x27;s and Rudisill gold mines. Charlotte is southwest of Concord; northeast of Rock Hill, South Carolina; southwest of Greensboro; west of Fayetteville; and southwest of Raleigh, the state capital.

Though the Catawba River and its lakes lie several miles west, there are no significant bodies of water or other geological features near the city center. Consequently, development has neither been constrained nor helped by waterways or ports that have contributed to many cities of similar size. The lack of these obstructions has contributed to Charlotte&#x27;s growth as a highway, rail, and air transportation hub.

===Neighborhoods===
 

Charlotte has 199 neighborhoods radiating in all directions from Uptown. Biddleville, the primary historic center of Charlotte&#x27;s African American community, is west of Uptown, starting at the Johnson C. Smith University campus and extending to the airport. East of The Plaza and north of Central Avenue, Plaza-Midwood is known for its international population, including Eastern Europeans, Greeks, Middle-Easterners, and Hispanics. North Tryon and the Sugar Creek area include several Asian American communities. NoDa (North Davidson), north of Uptown, is an emerging center for arts and entertainment. Myers Park, Dilworth, and Eastover are home to some of Charlotte&#x27;s most affluent, oldest and largest houses, on tree-lined boulevards, with Freedom Park nearby.

The SouthPark area offers shopping, dining, and multifamily housing. Far South Boulevard is home to a large Hispanic community. Many students, researchers, and affiliated professionals live near UNC Charlotte in the northeast area known as University City.

The large area known as Southeast Charlotte is home to many golf communities, luxury developments, churches, the Jewish community center, and private schools. As undeveloped land within Mecklenburg has become scarce, many of these communities have expanded into Weddington and Waxhaw in Union County. Ballantyne, in the south of Charlotte, and nearly every area on the I‑485 perimeter, has experienced rapid growth over the past ten years. The Steele Creek neighborhood which is primarily in Mecklenburg county is located within minutes near Uptown Charlotte.

Since the 1980s in particular, Uptown Charlotte has undergone massive construction of buildings, housing Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Hearst Corporation, and Duke Energy, several hotels, and multiple condominium developments.

===Parks and green space===

Latta Park was created in 1891 as an amusement park.

Bryant Park was established in the 1930s and is one of the earliest small-scale public parks in Charlotte. It is the only green space remaining in West Morehead Street&#x27;s industrial sector.

The Park Road Park is a prominent landmark near the SouthPark area. Park Road Park features eight basketball courts, two horseshoe pits, six baseball fields, five picnic shelters, volleyball courts, playgrounds, trails, tennis courts, and an lake. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Parks &amp; Recreation Department operates 36 tennis facilities and the 12 lighted tennis courts at the park. In September 2013, the Romare Bearden Park opened to the public.

The urban section of Little Sugar Creek Greenway was completed in 2012. Inspired in part by the San Antonio River Walk, and integral to Charlotte&#x27;s extensive urban park system, it is &quot;a huge milestone&quot; according to Gwen Cook, greenway planner for Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation. However, the Little Sugar Creek Greenway bears no relation to the San Antonio River Walk. The Little Sugar Creek Greenway is prone to flooding during thunderstorms and periods of heavy rain. Creation of Little Sugar Creek Greenway cost $43 million and was controversial because it required the forced acquisition of several established local businesses.

The city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County began purchasing flood-prone homes in the 1990s. Voluntary buyouts of 700 households have created around s of open land that can flood safely, thereby saving an estimated $28 million in flood damage and emergency rescues.

McAlpine Creek Park and integrated McAlpine Creek Greenway constructed in 1978 was the first greenway built in the western piedmont of North Carolina.

===Climate===
Like much of the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States, Charlotte has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with four distinct seasons. Charlotte is part of USDA hardiness zone 8a, transitioning to 7b in the suburbs in all directions except the south. The following narrative reflects 1991–2020 climate data. Winters are short and fairly mild, with a normal January daily mean temperature of . On occasion the temperature can fall below but Charlotte also enjoys multiple warm winter days in excess of . On average, there are 59 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 1.5 days that fail to rise above freezing.

Precipitation is evenly distributed through the year. Only August stands out as a slightly wetter month, averaging 4.35 inches of rainfall. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of . Hot and humid days can arrive as early as May and last to the end of September. There is an average of 44 days per year with highs at or above . Official record temperatures range from recorded six times on 6 September 1954, 9–10 August 2007 and June 29 to July 1, 2012, down to recorded on December 30, 1880, February 14, 1899 and January 21, 1985. The record cold daily maximum is on February 12 and 13, 1899. The record warm daily minimum is on August 13, 1881. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 5 to March 30, allowing a growing season of 220 days.

Charlotte is directly in the path of subtropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico as it heads up the eastern seaboard, thus the city receives ample precipitation throughout the year but also many clear, sunny days. Precipitation is generally less frequent in autumn than in spring. On average, Charlotte receives of precipitation annually, evenly distributed throughout the year. Annual precipitation has historically ranged from in 2001 to in 1884.

There is an average of of snow, mainly in January and February and rarely December or March, with more frequent ice storms and sleet mixed in with rain. Seasonal snowfall has historically ranged from trace amounts in 2011–12 to in 1959–60. Snow and ice storms can have a major impact on the area, as they often pull tree limbs down onto power lines and make driving hazardous. Snow has been recorded a small number of times in April, most recently on April 2, 2019.

, the Charlotte metropolitan area as a whole is noted for having one of the worst weather radar gaps among any major U.S. East Coast city, with little to no coverage in a roughly quadrilateral area spanning Concord, Salisbury and much 
of Statesville. As the nearest NWS-owned NEXRAD is located in Greer, South Carolina, more than to the west-southwest of Charlotte, this deficit is particularly problematic during severe thunderstorm or tornado episodes. The current lowest angle of the radar, based in Greer, is quite far above the surface over Charlotte, so the velocities measurement for detecting rotations cannot be below mid-level in potential tornado-forming storms and thus cannot indicate whether said rotation extends closer to the ground (below ).

===Zoos and aquariums===
Charlotte is &quot;... the largest metropolitan area in the United States without a zoo&quot;. The Charlotte Zoo initiative is a proposal to allocate of natural North Carolina land to be dedicated to the zoological foundation, which was incorporated in 2008. On August 18, 2012, Channel 14 News says that the initiative is &quot;... still a few years away&quot; and the plot of land is &quot;... just seven miles from the center of uptown&quot;. According to the news channel, &quot;... the zoo will cost roughly $300 million, and will be completely funded.&quot; The Charlotte Observer references two other zoos, the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden and the North Carolina Zoological Park as two &quot;great zoos&quot; that are accessible from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area, both roughly more than 70 miles away.

Charlotte is also served by the Sea Life Charlotte-Concord Aquarium in the nearby city of Concord. The aquarium is 30,000 square feet in size, and is part of the Concord Mills mall. The aquarium opened on February 20, 2014.

===Libraries===

The Charlotte Mecklenburg Library serves the Charlotte area with a large collection (more than 1.5 million) of books, CDs and DVDs at 15 locations in the city of Charlotte, with branches in the surrounding towns of Matthews, Mint Hill, Huntersville, Cornelius and Davidson. All locations provide free access to Internet-enabled computers and WiFi, and a library card from one location is accepted at all 20 locations.

Although the library&#x27;s roots go back to the &quot;Charlotte Literary and Library Association,&quot; founded on January 16, 1891, the state-chartered Carnegie Library, which opened on the current North Tryon site of the Main Library, was the first non-subscription library opened to members of the public in the city of Charlotte. The philanthropist Andrew Carnegie donated $25,000 for a library building, on the condition that the city of Charlotte donate a site and $2,500 per year for books and salaries, and that the state grant a charter for the library. All conditions were met, and the Charlotte Carnegie Library opened in an imposing classical building on July 2, 1903.

The 1903 state charter also required that a library be opened for the disenfranchised African-American population of Charlotte. This was completed in 1905 with the opening of the &quot;Brevard Street Library for Negroes&quot;, an independent library in Brooklyn, a historically black area of Charlotte, on the corner of Brevard and East Second Streets (now Martin Luther King Boulevard). The Brevard Street Library was the first library for African Americans in the state of North Carolina, and some sources say in the southeast. The library was closed in 1961 when the Brooklyn neighborhood in Second Ward was redeveloped, but its role as a cultural center for African-Americans in Charlotte is continued by the Beatties Ford and West Boulevard branches of the library system, as well as by Charlotte&#x27;s African-American Cultural Center.

Carolina has reached the Super Bowl twice but has been unsuccessful in both losing to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 and against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 in 2016. The original Hornets NBA franchise was established in 1988 as an expansion team, but it relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana in 2002 after animosity grew between the team&#x27;s fans and principal owner George Shinn. The NBA quickly granted Charlotte an expansion franchise following the departure of the Hornets and the new franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, began to play in 2004. The team retook the Hornets name when the New Orleans–based team renamed itself the New Orleans Pelicans in 2013. The name change became official on May 20, 2014. On the same day, the franchise reclaimed the history and records of the original 1988–2002 Hornets. MLS awarded its expansion team to Charlotte in 2019, which began play as Charlotte FC in 2022.

==Government==
Charlotte has a council–manager form of government. The mayor and Charlotte City Council are elected every two years, with no term limits. The mayor is &quot;ex officio&quot; chair of the City Council, and only votes in case of a tie. Unlike other mayors in council–manager systems, Charlotte&#x27;s mayor has the power to veto ordinances passed by the council; the council can override a mayoral veto by a vote of seven of its ten members. The Council appoints a city manager to serve as chief administrative officer.

Unlike some other cities and towns in North Carolina, elections are held on a partisan basis. Vi Lyles, a Democrat elected in 2017, became the 59th mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. She was elected to her third term in 2022.

Patrick Cannon, a Democrat, was sworn in as mayor on December 2, 2013. On March 26, 2014, Cannon was arrested on public corruption charges. Later the same day, he resigned as mayor. Mayor Pro Tem Michael Barnes served as Acting Mayor until April 7, when the City Council selected State Senator Dan Clodfelter, also a Democrat, to serve the remainder of Cannon&#x27;s term. Former Mecklenburg County Commission chairwoman Jennifer Roberts defeated Clodfelter in the 2015 Democratic primary and went on to win the general election, becoming the first Democratic woman to be elected to the post. She was ousted in the 2017 Democratic primary by Mayor Pro Tem Vi Lyles, who later defeated Republican City Councilman Kenny Smith in the general election to become Mayor of Charlotte.

Historically, voters have been friendly to moderates of both parties. However, in recent years, Charlotte has swung heavily to the Democrats. Republican strength is concentrated in the southeastern portion of the city, while Democratic strength is concentrated in the south-central, eastern, and northern areas. The city had a Republican mayor from 1987 to 2009.

The Charlotte City Council has 11 members (7 from districts and 4 at-large). Democrats control the council with a 9-to-2 advantage, winning all 4 of the at-large seats in the November 2013, 2015, and 2017 municipal elections. While the City Council is responsible for passing ordinances, the city&#x27;s budget, and other policies, all decisions can be overridden by the North Carolina General Assembly, since North Carolina municipalities do not have home rule. While municipal powers have been broadly construed since the 1960s, the General Assembly still retains considerable authority over local matters.

Charlotte is split between two congressional districts on the federal level. The northern half of the city is in the 12th district, represented by Democrat Alma Adams. The southern half is in the 14th district, represented by Democrat Jeff Jackson. Charlotte is represented by ten members of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Mary Gardner Belk (D-88th), Terry M. Brown Jr. (D-92nd), Nasif Majeed (D-99th), John Autry (D-100th), Carolyn Logan (D-101st), Becky Carney (D-102nd), Brandon Lofton (D-104th), Wesley Harris (D-105th), Carla Cunningham (D-106th), and Kelly Alexander (D-107th), and six members of the North Carolina Senate, Mujtaba A. Mohammed (D-38th), DeAndrea Salvador (D-39th), Joyce Waddell (D-40th), Rachel Hunt (D-42nd), Vickie Sawyer (R-37th), and Natasha Marcus (D-41st).

Charlotte was selected in 2011 to host the 2012 Democratic National Convention, which was held at the Spectrum Center. It began September 4, 2012, and ended on September 6, 2012.

<doc id="57448" wikidata="Q873761" url="?curid=57448" title="Tapioca">
<text>Tapioca (; ) is a starch extracted from the tubers of the cassava plant (&quot;Manihot esculenta,&quot; also known as manioc), a species native to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, but which has now spread throughout parts of the World such as West Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a perennial shrub adapted to the hot conditions of tropical lowlands. Cassava copes better with poor soils than many other food plants.

Tapioca is a staple food for millions of people in tropical countries. It provides only carbohydrate food value, and is low in protein, vitamins, and minerals. In other countries, it is used as a thickening agent in various manufactured foods.

==Etymology==

&quot;Tapioca&quot; is derived from the word &quot;tipi&#x27;óka&quot;, its name in the Tupi language spoken by natives when the Portuguese first arrived in the Northeast Region of Brazil around 1500. This Tupi word is translated as &#x27;sediment&#x27; or &#x27;coagulant&#x27; and refers to the curd-like starch sediment that is obtained in the extraction process.

==Production==


The cassava plant is easily propagated by stem-cutting, grows well in low-nutrient soils, and can be harvested every two months, although it takes ten months to grow to full maturity.

The cassava plant has either red or green branches with blue spindles on them. The root of the green-branched variant requires treatment to remove linamarin, a cyanogenic glycoside occurring naturally in the plant, which otherwise may be converted into cyanide. Konzo (also called mantakassa) is a paralytic disease associated with several weeks of almost exclusive consumption of insufficiently processed bitter cassava.

In Brazil&#x27;s north and northeast, traditional community-based tapioca production is a byproduct of manioc flour production from cassava roots. In this process, the manioc (after treatment to remove toxicity) is ground to a pulp with a small hand- or diesel-powered mill. This masa is then squeezed to dry it out. The wet masa is placed in a long woven tube called a . The top of the tube is secured while a large branch or lever is inserted into a loop at the bottom and used to stretch the entire implement vertically, squeezing a starch-rich liquid out through the weave and ends. This liquid is collected, and the microscopic starch grains in it are allowed to settle into the bottom of the container. The supernatant liquid is then poured off, leaving behind a wet starch sediment that needs to be dried and results in the fine-grained tapioca starch powder similar in appearance to corn starch.

Commercially, the starch is processed into several forms: hot soluble powder, meal, pre-cooked fine or coarse flakes, rectangular sticks, and spherical &quot;pearls.&quot; Pearls are the most widely available shape; sizes range from about 1 mm to 8 mm in diameter, with 2–3 mm being the most common.

Flakes, sticks, and pearls must be soaked well before cooking to rehydrate, absorbing water up to twice their volume. After rehydration, tapioca products become leathery and swollen. Processed tapioca is usually white, but sticks and pearls may be colored. Traditionally, the most common color applied to tapioca has been brown, but recently pastel colors have been available. Tapioca pearls are generally opaque when raw but become translucent when cooked in boiling water.

Brazil, Thailand, and Nigeria are the world&#x27;s largest cassava producers. Currently, Thailand accounts for about 60 percent of worldwide exports.

=== Storage ===
When roots are sold to processing factories, they must be processed within 24 hours of harvest to ensure raw material freshness and prevent microflora growth. This would be observed as brown-black discolorations in a freshly broken root.

All process water streams contain some amount of sulfur dioxide to control the growth of microbes. Dried starch provides a shelf-stable product. For example, uncooked, dried tapioca pearls have at least a 2-year shelf life stability, whereas freshly cooked pearls may last ten days in the refrigerator. This difference is accounted to the water activity difference between the dried and wet product, the latter introducing a much more favorable condition for microbes to grow.

==Uses==

===Nutrition===

Dried tapioca pearls are 11% water and 89% carbohydrates, with no protein or fat. In a 100-gram reference amount, dried tapioca supplies 358 calories and no or only trace amounts of dietary minerals and vitamins.

=== Flatbreads ===
A casabe is a thin flatbread made from bitter cassava root without leavening. It was originally produced by the indigenous Arawak and Carib peoples because these roots were a common plant of the rain forests where they lived. In eastern Venezuela, many indigenous groups still make &quot;casabe&quot;. It is their chief bread-like staple. Indigenous communities, such as the Ye-Kuana, Kari-Ña, Yanomami, Guarao or Warao descended from the Caribe or Arawac nations, still make &quot;casabe&quot;.
To make &quot;casabe&quot;, the starchy root of bitter cassava is ground to a pulp, then squeezed to expel a milky, bitter liquid called &quot;yare&quot;. This carries the poisonous substances with it out of the pulp. Traditionally, this squeezing is done in a &quot;sebucan&quot;, an 8 to long, tube-shaped, pressure strainer, woven in a characteristic helical pattern from palm leaves. The &quot;sebucan&quot; usually is hung from a tree branch or ceiling pole, and it has a closed bottom with a loop that is attached to a fixed stick or lever, which is used to stretch the sebucan. When the lever is pushed down, stretching the sebucan, the helical weaving pattern causes the strainer to squeeze the pulp inside. This is similar to the action of a Chinese finger trap. The pulp is spread in thin, round cakes about in diameter on a &quot;budare&quot; to roast or toast.

Thin and crisp cakes of &quot;casabe&quot; are often broken apart and eaten like crackers. Like bread, &quot;casabe&quot; can be eaten alone or with other dishes. Thicker &quot;casabe&quot; usually are eaten slightly moistened. A sprinkle of a few drops of liquid is enough to transform a dry &quot;casabe&quot; into soft, smooth bread.

===Tapioca pearls===

Tapioca pearls, also known as &quot;boba&quot; in East Asia, are produced by passing the moist starch through a sieve under pressure. Pearl tapioca is a common ingredient in Asian desserts such as falooda, kolak, sago soup, and in sweet drinks such as bubble tea, fruit slush and taho, where they provide a chewy contrast to the sweetness and smooth texture of the drink. Small pearls are preferred for use in puddings. Large pearls are preferred for use in drinks. These pearls most often are brown, not white, due to the sugar added and are traditionally used in black or green tea drinks. They are used as various colors in shave ice and hot drinks. In addition to their use in puddings and beverages, tapioca pearls may be used in cakes.

The pearls are known as &quot;sābudānā&quot; in the Indian subcontinent; they are used for sweet and savory dishes, such as sabudana khichri. In Brazil, the pearls are cooked with wine or other liquid to add flavor and are called &quot;sagu&quot;.

====Processing and properties====

Processing of the cassava flour into tapioca pearls requires the intermediate step of a product called tapioca grit. Tapioca grit is dried cassava flour that is partially gelatinized so that it looks like flakes or irregularly-shaped granules.

In contrast, making starch pearls uses a different process of roasting. To form the pearls, the tapioca grit can be cut or extruded into the shape of pearls, either small () or large (). The pearls are subjected to a form of heat-moisture treatment, which can extend shelf life up to 2 years.

Tapioca pearls have many unique properties that contribute to texture and mouth feel. Many of these physical properties are a result of its starch composition and are significantly affected by processing. Tapioca pearls are characteristically soft and chewy, with a prominent elastic texture and translucent appearance.

===South America===
In Colombia and Venezuela, arepas may be made with tapioca flour rather than cornmeal. Tapioca arepas probably predate cornmeal arepas; among traditional cultures of the Caribbean, the name for them is casabe. Throughout both Spanish and Portuguese South America, the tapioca, or yuca, starch is used to make regional variations of the baked cheese bun, known locally as &quot;pandebono&quot;, &quot;pan de yuca&quot;, &quot;pão de queijo&quot;, &quot;chipá&quot;, or &quot;cuñapé&quot;, among other names.

The whole, unprocessed cassava root also has several culinary uses throughout South America.
====Brazil====
In Brazilian cuisine, tapioca is used for different types of meals. In beiju (or biju), also simply called &quot;tapioca,&quot; the tapioca is moistened, strained through a sieve to become a coarse flour, then sprinkled onto a hot griddle or pan, where the heat makes the moist grains fuse into a flatbread which resembles a pancake or crepe. Then it may be buttered and eaten like toast (its most common use as a breakfast dish), or it may be filled with savory or sweet fillings, which define the kind of meal the tapioca is used for: breakfast/dinner or dessert. Choices for fillings range from butter, cheese, ham, bacon, vegetables, various kinds of meat, chocolate, fruits such as ground coconut, condensed milk, chocolate with slices of banana or strawberry, Nutella and cinnamon among others. This kind of tapioca dish is usually served warm.

A regional dessert called &quot;sagu&quot; is also made in Southern Brazil from tapioca pearls traditionally cooked with cinnamon and cloves in red wine, although other fruit flavors may be used. The cassava root is known by different names throughout the country: &quot;mandioca&quot; in the North, Central-West, and São Paulo; &quot;macaxeira&quot; in the Northeast; &quot;aipim&quot; in the Southeast and South.

The fine-grained tapioca starch is called &quot;polvilho,&quot; and it is classified as either &quot;sweet&quot; or &quot;sour.&quot; Sour &quot;polvilho&quot; is commonly used in dishes such as &quot;pão de queijo&quot; or &quot;cheese bread,&quot; in which the starch is mixed with a hard cheese, usually matured Minas cheese (could be substituted by Parmesan cheese), eggs and butter and baked in the oven. The final result is an aromatic, chewy, and often crusty kind of bread that is ubiquitous across the country. Sweet &quot;polvilho&quot; is commonly used in cookies or cakes.

===North America===

While frequently associated with tapioca pudding, a dessert in the United States, tapioca is also used in other courses. People on gluten-free diets can eat bread made with tapioca flour (however some tapioca flour has wheat added to it). Tapioca syrup is sometimes added as a sweetener to a wide variety of foods and beverages as an alternative to sucrose or corn syrup.

===West Indies===

Tapioca is a staple food from which dishes such as pepper pot as well as alcohol are made. It may be used to clean the teeth, as a foodstuff cooked with meats or fish, and in desserts such as cassava pone.

Specifically in rural Cuba early in Spanish rule, tapioca&#x27;s popularity grew because it was easy to cultivate the crop and to transport it to nearby Spanish settlements, eventually influencing the way land and people were divided in that early imperial era.

=== Asia ===
In various Asian countries, tapioca pearls are widely used in desserts and drinks including Taiwanese bubble tea.

====Southeast Asia====

In Southeast Asia, the cassava root is commonly cut into slices, wedges or strips, fried, and served as tapioca chips, similar to potato chips, wedges or french fries. Another method is to boil large blocks until soft and serve them with grated coconut as a dessert, either slightly salted or sweetened, usually with palm sugar syrup. In Thailand, this dish is called &quot;mansampalang&quot; (มันสำปะหลัง).

Commercially prepared tapioca has many uses. Tapioca powder is commonly used as a thickener for soups and other liquid foods. It is also used as a binder in pharmaceutical tablets and natural paints. The flour is used to make tender breads, cakes, biscuits, cookies, and other delicacies. Tapioca flakes are used to thicken the filling of pies made with fruits having a high water content.

A typical recipe for tapioca jelly can be made by washing two tablespoonfuls of tapioca, pouring a pint of water over it, and soaking it for three hours. The mixture is placed over low heat and simmered until quite clear. If too thick, a little boiling water can be added. It can be sweetened with white sugar, flavored with coconut milk or a little wine, and eaten alone or with cream.

=====Indonesia=====
Krupuk, or traditional Indonesian crackers, is a significant use of tapioca starch in Indonesia. The most common krupuk is &quot;kerupuk kampung&quot; or &quot;kerupuk aci&quot; made of tapioca starch. The tapioca starch might be flavored with minced shrimp as &quot;krupuk udang&quot; (prawn cracker) or &quot;krupuk ikan&quot; (fish cracker). The thinly sliced or sometimes quite thick cassava was also sun-dried and deep fried to be made as &quot;kripik singkong&quot; crackers (cassava chips or tapioca chips). A variant of hot and spicy &quot;kripik singkong&quot; coated with sugar and chili pepper is known as &quot;kripik balado&quot; or &quot;keripik sanjay&quot;, a specialty of Bukittinggi city in West Sumatra.

Cilok is a tapioca dumpling snack. Tapai is made by fermenting large blocks with a yeast-like bacteria culture to produce a sweet and slightly alcoholic dessert. Further fermentation releases more liquids and alcohol, producing &quot;Tuak&quot;, a sour alcoholic beverage.

=====Malaysia=====
A variation of the chips popular amongst the Malays is &quot;kerepek pedas&quot;, where the crisps are coated with a hot, sweet, and tangy chili and onion paste, or sambal, usually with fried anchovies and peanuts added.

The cultivation of the plant is also extensively present in the Malay Peninsula, where in the hands of the Chinese, cassava tubers weighing from are first scraped and then washed carefully. By being passed between rollers, they are reduced to a pulp which is again carefully washed, then shaken up with water. This causes the fecula to separate and pass through a very fine sieve, resulting in flour. The flour is repeatedly washed and then placed on mats to bleach via sun exposure and air. Different applications may be applied here to give rise to the popular and loved tapioca pearls in bubble tea beverages, also known as boba. The pearl tapioca is achieved by placing the flour in a cradle-shaped frame covered with canvas, where it&#x27;s slightly moistened and rotated to be granulated. Finally, it is dried in the sun, then over the fire in a greased iron pan, and ready for the market.

===South Asia===
In South Asia, tapioca pearls are known as &quot;sagudana&quot;, &quot;sabudana&quot; or &quot;shabudana&quot; (pearl sago) or &quot;sabba akki&quot; (in Kannada). The pearls are used to make snacks.

====Bangladesh====
Sagudana is sometimes used in dessert dishes. Faluda, a popular food, is also prepared with curd, ice, and other ingredients during summer.

==== India ====

Tapioca pearls are a common ingredient of traditional Indian dishes such as kheer.

Tapioca pearls are used to make &quot;Sabudana khichdi, pakoda,  paratha&quot; in Maharashtra, which is commonly eaten during &quot;vrat&quot; (fasting). Indians generally soak it overnight or 6-8 hours in before cooking.

Cassava is referred to as Tapioca in Indian English usage. Cassava is called kappa or maracheeni in Malayalam.

It was introduced in 1880-1885 C.E. by the then Maharaja of Travancore, Vishakham Thirunal Rama Varma after a great famine hit the kingdom, as a substitute for rice.

Tapioca is widely consumed across Kerala. It is taken as breakfast or as a staple food. It is boiled (after skinning and cutting it into large pieces of about long or into small cubes) in water till adequately cooked, and the water is drained off. Once cooked, it can be mixed with grated coconut, chili, salt, turmeric, etc., then steamed and mashed into a dry pudding. If desired, this can be garnished with oil with mustard, onion, curry leaves, etc. Tapioca pieces (chendan kappa) are often eaten with simple chili sauce (a paste of green/red chili, shallots, garlic, salt, and oil).

Mashed tapioca is paired with meat or fish curry, especially sardines, as a delicacy in Kerala. Another popular combination is mashed tapioca with dried salted sardines directly cooked on charcoal and green chili.

Tapioca can be stored for extended periods by parboiling, drying it after skinning, and slicing it into 0.5 cm thick pieces. This is called unakka kappa (dried tapioca). Tapioca chips, thinly sliced tapioca wafers, similar to potato chips, are also extremely popular.

In Tamil, the roots of tapioca are called &quot;maravalli kizhangu&quot; and are used to prepare chips.
Tapioca pearls are referred to as &quot;javvarisi&quot; in Tamil. Most of the delicacies are cooked from this form of tapioca because it is easier to handle than the raw root itself. Tapioca is cultivated more in several districts, providing steady income to farmers in Tamil Nadu. Tapioca can be consumed raw (after removing the skins/outer cover) or boiled for various dishes or snacks.

In Nagaland and Mizoram in Northeast India, tapioca is eaten as a snack. It is usually boiled with a bit of salt in water after skinning it, or snacks are made by drying the tapioca after cutting it. It is then powdered into flour and turned into dough to either make a fired or baked biscuit. In their local dialect, they call it &quot;kuri aloo&quot;, meaning &quot;wood potato.&quot; All groups of society eat these chips as a delicacy. The skin of the tapioca, which is not edible for humans, is kept aside to prepare food for domesticated pigs.

In Assam, sabudana is also used as a substitute diet against boiled rice (bhaat) for the sick, elderly, or infirm for easy digestion and strength.

==== Sri Lanka ====
It is known as &quot;mangnokka&quot; in Sri Lanka, as well as by its Sinhalese and Tamil names. It is generally eaten boiled with a chili onion mixture called &quot;lunu miris sambol&quot; (a type of salsa) or coconut sambal. Another popular cassava dish is a curry cooked in coconut milk with a splash of turmeric. At the same time, it is popular to have tapioca pearls prepared as a delicacy. At one time, tapioca pearls were used to starch clothes by boiling tapioca pearls with the clothes. Spiced cassava chips are a popular snack usually sold by street vendors and street-side shops.

===Africa===

Tapioca is eaten in the regions of Nigeria and Ghana as a common meal, usually at breakfast. Cassava is a staple food in West Africa, where it is widely eaten. In Nigeria, cassava is grated and dry roasted into &quot;garri&quot;; this is consumed by adding water, sugar, and or peanuts accompanied by meat or smoked fish. Garri is also made into &quot;eba&quot; by adding hot water; this is eaten with stew or soup. The Ijebu people of Nigeria make a cold water variant of eba by pounding the mixture with their fist until it becomes homogeneous; this is called &quot;feshelu&quot;. The Egbas of Abeokuta, Ogun State peel, dry, and grind cassava into a powder called &quot;elubo&quot;, which is then made into &quot;amala paki&quot; and eaten with a jute leaf stew called &quot;ewedu&quot;.

In Lagos, cassava is processed into tapioca which is cooked in coconut milk and sugar; this can be eaten as a breakfast meal or as a dessert at parties or dinner. This is called &quot;mengau&quot;.

The Igbos of Eastern Nigeria add palm oil and other seasonings to boiled and grated cassava, a dish called &quot;abacha&quot;.

People of the Niger Delta extract starch from cassava cooked into a starch eaten with pepper soup.

In Ghana, cassava is peeled, boiled until tender, and pounded in a large wooden mortar and pestle until it becomes homogeneous. This is called &quot;fufu&quot;. It is eaten with soup.

===Europe===
In Belgium, tiny white tapioca pearls are added to clear soups. Tapioca pearls are used in French desserts, such as parfaits. A savory snack in the United Kingdom, Skips, is made from flavored tapioca.

Tapioca is also widely available in its dried forms and is used in some countries to make tapioca pudding.

=== Other uses ===
Tapioca root can be used to manufacture biodegradable bags developed from a tapioca resin of the plant as a viable plastic substitute. The product is renewable, reusable and recyclable. Other tapioca resin products include gloves, capes and aprons.

Tapioca starch, used commonly for starching shirts and garments before ironing, may be sold in bottles of natural gum starch to be dissolved in water or in spray cans.

The low amylose and low residual content, combined with the high molecular weight of its amylose, make tapioca a useful starting material for modification into a variety of specialty products. Tapioca starch applications in specialty products have become increasingly popular. The effects of additives on thermal transitions and physical and chemical properties can affect the quality and storage stability of tapioca-based products.

Salt is often added to starch-based products to enhance flavor and functionality, as it can increase the gelatinization temperature of tapioca starch and delay the retrogradation of the gels formed upon cooling. Cations, particularly Na+ and Ca2+, can interact electrostatically with the oxygen atoms in the glucose molecule of the starch polymer. This interaction induces an antiplasticizing effect and increases competition for available water, increasing the glass transition temperature of the gelatinized molecule.

<doc id="57454" wikidata="Q179090" url="?curid=57454" title="Aaron Burr">
<text>Aaron Burr Jr. (February 6, 1756 – September 14, 1836) was an American politician, businessman, lawyer, and Founding Father who served as the third vice president of the United States from 1801 to 1805 during Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s first presidential term. He founded the Manhattan Company on September 1, 1799. Burr is remembered for his famous personal and political conflict with Alexander Hamilton, which culminated in the Burr–Hamilton duel in Weehawken, New Jersey, on July 11, 1804. Burr mortally wounded Hamilton, who died from his wounds the following day.

Burr was born to a prominent family in what was then the Province of New Jersey. After studying theology at Princeton University, he began his career as a lawyer before joining the Continental Army as an officer in the American Revolutionary War in 1775. After leaving military service in 1779, Burr practiced law in New York City, where he became a leading politician and helped form the new Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican Party. As a New York assemblyman in 1785, he supported a bill to end slavery, despite having owned slaves himself.

In 1791, Burr was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served until 1797. He later ran as the Democratic-Republican vice-presidential candidate in the 1800 election. An Electoral College tie between Burr and Thomas Jefferson resulted in the U.S. House of Representatives voting in Jefferson&#x27;s favor, with Burr becoming Jefferson&#x27;s vice president due to receiving the second-highest share of the votes. Although Burr maintained that he supported Jefferson, the president was somewhat at odds with Burr, who was relegated to the sidelines of the administration during his vice presidency and was not selected as Jefferson&#x27;s running mate in 1804 after the ratification of the 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

During his last full year as vice president, Burr engaged in the duel in which he fatally shot Alexander Hamilton, the former Secretary of the Treasury and his political rival, near where Hamilton&#x27;s son Philip Hamilton had died in a duel three years prior. Although dueling was illegal, Burr was never tried and all charges against him were eventually dropped. Nevertheless, his killing of Hamilton ended his political career.

Burr traveled west to the American frontier, seeking new economic and political opportunities. His secretive activities led to his 1807 arrest in Alabama on charges of treason. He was brought to trial more than once for what became known as the Burr conspiracy, an alleged plot to create an independent country led by Burr, but was acquitted each time. For a short period of time, Burr left the United States to live in Europe. He returned in 1812 and resumed practicing law in New York City. Burr died on September 14, 1836, at the age of 80.

==Early life==

Aaron Burr Jr. was born on February 6, 1756, in Newark, in what was then the Province of New Jersey, one of the Thirteen Colonies of the colonial era British America. He was the second child of the Reverend Aaron Burr Sr. (1716–1757), a Presbyterian minister and second president of the College of New Jersey, which later became Princeton University. His mother, Esther Edwards Burr (1732–1758), was the daughter of Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758), a theologian, and his wife Sarah Edwards (1710–1758).

In 1757, Burr&#x27;s father died while serving as president of the college in Princeton. His grandfather, Jonathan Edwards, succeeded his father as the college&#x27;s president, and lived with Burr and his mother in December 1757. Edwards died in March 1758, and Burr&#x27;s mother and grandmother died the same year, leaving Burr and his sister orphaned when he was two years old. Young Burr and his sister were then placed with the William Shippen family in the Philadelphia, capital of British America. The following year, in 1759, the children&#x27;s guardianship was assumed by their 21-year-old maternal uncle, Timothy Edwards. The following year, Edwards married Rhoda Ogden, and moved the family to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Burr attended the Elizabethtown Academy. Burr had a very strained relationship with his uncle, who was often physically abusive. As a child, he made several attempts to run away from home.

At age 13, Burr was admitted to Princeton as a sophomore, where he joined the American Whig Society and the Cliosophic Society, the college&#x27;s literary and debating societies. In 1772, at age 16, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree, but continued studying theology at Princeton for an additional year. He then undertook rigorous theological training with Joseph Bellamy, a Presbyterian, but changed his career path after two years. At age 19, he moved to Litchfield, Connecticut to study law with his brother-in-law Tapping Reeve, founder of the Litchfield Law School. In 1775, news reached Litchfield of the clashes with British troops at Lexington and Concord, and Burr put his studies on hold to enlist in the Continental Army.

==Revolutionary War==

During the American Revolutionary War, Burr took part in Colonel Benedict Arnold&#x27;s expedition to Quebec, an arduous trek of more than through the northern frontier of the Province of Massachusetts Bay (now Maine). Arnold was impressed by Burr&#x27;s &quot;great spirit and resolution&quot; during the long march. He sent him up the Saint Lawrence River to contact General Richard Montgomery, who had taken Montreal, and escort him to Quebec. Montgomery then promoted Burr to captain and made him an aide-de-camp. Burr distinguished himself during the Battle of Quebec on December 31, 1775, where he attempted to recover Montgomery&#x27;s corpse after he had been killed.

In the spring of 1776, Burr&#x27;s stepbrother Matthias Ogden helped him to secure a position with George Washington&#x27;s staff in Manhattan, but he quit on June 26 to be on the battlefield. General Israel Putnam took Burr under his wing, and Burr saved an entire brigade from capture after the British landing in Manhattan by his vigilance in the retreat from Lower Manhattan to Harlem. Washington failed to commend his actions in the next day&#x27;s General Orders, which was the fastest way to obtain a promotion. Burr was already a nationally known hero, but he never received a commendation. According to Ogden, he was infuriated by the incident, which may have led to the eventual estrangement between him and Washington. Nevertheless, Burr defended Washington&#x27;s decision to evacuate New York as &quot;a necessary consequence&quot;. It was not until the 1790s that the two men found themselves on opposite sides in politics.

Burr was briefly posted in Kingsbridge during 1776, at which time he was charged with protecting 14-year-old Margaret Moncrieffe, the daughter of Staten Island-based British Major Thomas Moncrieffe. Miss Moncrieffe was in Manhattan &quot;behind enemy lines,&quot; and Major Moncrieffe asked Washington to ensure her safe return there. Burr fell in love with Margaret, and her attempts to remain with Burr were unsuccessful.

In late 1776, Burr attempted to secure Washington&#x27;s approval to retake fortifications on Staten Island, which were then held by the British, citing his deep familiarity with the area. Washington said he wanted to defer such an action until later in the conflict, and ultimately chose not to pursue it. The British learned of Burr&#x27;s plans and later took extra precautions.

In July 1777, Burr was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed virtual leadership of Malcolm&#x27;s Additional Continental Regiment. There were approximately 300 men under Colonel William Malcolm&#x27;s nominal command, but Malcolm was frequently called upon to perform other duties, leaving Burr in charge. The regiment successfully fought off many nighttime raids into central New Jersey by Manhattan-based British troops who arrived by water. Later that year, Burr commanded a small contingent during the harsh winter encampment at Valley Forge, guarding &quot;the Gulph,&quot; an isolated pass that controlled one approach to the camp. He imposed discipline and defeated an attempted mutiny by some of the troops.

Burr&#x27;s regiment was devastated by British artillery on June 28, 1778, at the Battle of Monmouth in New Jersey, and Burr suffered heatstroke and exhaustion. Washington denied Burr&#x27;s request for medical leave without pay, and instead placed Burr in temporary command of the garrison at West Point, New York, until his recovery.
In January 1779, Burr was assigned to Westchester County, New York, in command of Malcolm&#x27;s Regiment, a region between the British post at Kingsbridge and that of the Americans about to the north. This district was part of the more significant command of General Alexander McDougall, and there was much turbulence and plundering by lawless bands of civilians and by raiding parties of ill-disciplined soldiers from both armies.

Due to continuing poor health, Burr resigned from the Continental Army in March 1779. During his recovery, Burr carried urgent messages to Washington and various officers at the request of Generals McDougall and Arthur St. Clair. On July 5, 1779, he rallied a group of Yale students at New Haven, Connecticut, along with Captain James Hillhouse and the Second Connecticut Governor&#x27;s Guards, in a skirmish with the British at the West River. The British advance was repulsed, forcing them to enter New Haven from nearby Hamden.

In 1783, Burr became an Original Member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of officers who had served in the Continental Army and Navy during the Revolution.

===Marriage to Theodosia Bartow Prevost===

Burr met Theodosia Bartow Prevost in August 1778 while she was married to Jacques Marcus Prevost, a Swiss-born British officer in the Royal American Regiment. In Prevost&#x27;s absence, Burr began regularly visiting Theodosia at The Hermitage, her home in New Jersey. Theodosia would go on to visit Burr many times throughout his stay at West Point New York in June through July 1778. Although she was ten years older than Burr, the constant visits provoked gossip, and by 1780 the two were openly lovers. In December 1781, Burr learned that Jacques Marcus Prevost had died in Jamaica of yellow fever.

Burr and Theodosia were married in 1782, and they moved to a house on Wall Street in Lower Manhattan. After several years of severe illness, Theodosia died in 1794 from stomach or uterine cancer. Their only child to survive to adulthood was Theodosia Burr Alston, born in 1783.

==Law and politics==
Burr resumed his study of law in the autumn of 1780. He was licensed as an attorney in Albany, New York, in January 1782, and was admitted to the bar as a counselor that April. He promptly opened a successful law office in Albany. He moved his law practice to New York City the following year, after the British evacuated the city.

Burr served in the New York State Assembly in 1784–85. In 1784, as an assemblyman, he unsuccessfully sought to abolish slavery immediately following the war. He also continued his military service as a lieutenant colonel and commander of a regiment in the militia brigade commanded by William Malcolm. He became seriously involved in politics in 1789, when Governor George Clinton appointed him as New York State Attorney General. He was also Commissioner of Revolutionary War Claims in 1791. In 1791, he was elected by the legislature as a United States Senator from New York, defeating incumbent General Philip Schuyler. He served in the U.S. Senate until 1797.

Burr ran in the 1796 presidential election and received 30 electoral votes, coming in fourth behind John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Pinckney. He was shocked by this defeat, but many Democratic-Republican electors voted for Jefferson and a candidate other than Burr.

President John Adams appointed Washington as commanding general of U.S. forces in 1798, but he rejected Burr&#x27;s application for a brigadier general&#x27;s commission during the Quasi-War with France. Washington wrote, &quot;By all that I have known and heard, Colonel Burr is a brave and able officer, but the question is whether he has not equal talents at intrigue.&quot; Burr was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1798 and served there through 1799. During this time, he cooperated with the Holland Land Company in gaining passage of a law to permit aliens to hold and convey lands. National parties became clearly defined during Adams&#x27; presidency, and Burr loosely associated himself with the Democratic-Republicans. However, he had moderate Federalist allies such as Senator Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey.

===New York City politics===

Burr quickly became a key player in New York politics, largely due to the power of the Tammany Society (which became Tammany Hall). Burr converted it from a social club into a political machine to help Jefferson reach the presidency, particularly in New York City.

In September 1799, Burr fought a duel with John Barker Church, whose wife Angelica was the sister-in-law of Alexander Hamilton. Church had accused Burr of taking a bribe from the Holland Land Company in exchange for his political influence. Burr and Church fired at each other and missed, and afterward, Church acknowledged that he was wrong to have accused Burr without proof. Burr accepted this as an apology, and the two men shook hands and ended the dispute.

In September 1799, Burr founded his own bank, the Manhattan Company, and the enmity between him and Hamilton may have arisen from how he did so. Before the establishment of Burr&#x27;s bank, the Federalists held a monopoly on banking interests in New York via the federal government&#x27;s Bank of the United States and Hamilton&#x27;s Bank of New York. These banks financed operations of significant business interests owned by aristocratic members of the city. Hamilton had prevented the formation of rival banks. Small businessmen relied on tontines to buy property and establish a voting voice (at this time, voting was based upon property rights).

Burr solicited support from Hamilton and other Federalists under the guise that he was establishing a badly needed water company for Manhattan. He secretly changed the application for a state charter at the last minute to include the ability to invest surplus funds in any cause that did not violate state law, and dropped any pretense of founding a water company once he had gained approval, but he did dig a well and built a large working water storage tank on the site of his bank, which was still standing and apparently still working in 1898. Hamilton and other supporters believed that Burr had acted dishonorably in deceiving them. Meanwhile, construction was delayed on a safe water system for Manhattan, and writer Ron Chernow suggests that the delay may have contributed to deaths during a subsequent malaria epidemic.

The Manhattan Company was more than a bank; it was a tool to promote Democratic-Republican power and influence, and its loans were directed to partisans. By extending credit to small businessmen, who then obtained enough property to gain the franchise to vote, the bank was able to increase the party&#x27;s electorate. Federalist bankers in New York responded by trying to organize a credit boycott of Democratic-Republican businessmen.

==1800 presidential election==
In the 1800 United States presidential election, Burr combined the political influence of the Manhattan Company with party campaign innovations to deliver New York&#x27;s support for Thomas Jefferson. That year, New York&#x27;s state legislature chose the presidential electors, as they had four years earlier, in 1796, when they gave their support to John Adams. Prior to the April 1800 legislative elections, the State Assembly was controlled by the Federalists. The City of New York elected assembly members on an at-large basis. Burr and Hamilton were the key campaigners for their respective parties. Burr&#x27;s Democratic-Republican slate of assemblymen was elected, giving the party control of the legislature, which in turn gave New York State&#x27;s electoral votes to Jefferson and Burr. This drove another wedge between Burr and Hamilton, who had developed a rivalry with Jefferson.

Burr enlisted the help of Tammany Hall to win the voting for selection of Electoral College delegates. He gained a place on the Democratic-Republican presidential ticket with Jefferson in the 1800 election. Jefferson and Burr won New York, and tied for the presidency overall, with 73 electoral votes each. Members of the Democratic-Republican Party understood they intended that Jefferson should be president and Burr vice president, but the tied vote required that the final choice be made by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each of the sixteen states having one vote, and nine votes needed for election.

Burr remained quiet publicly, refusing to surrender the presidency to Jefferson, who was seen as the great enemy of the Federalists. Rumors circulated that he and a faction of Federalists were encouraging Democratic-Republican representatives to vote for him, blocking Jefferson&#x27;s election in the House. However, solid evidence of such a conspiracy was lacking, and historians generally gave Burr the benefit of the doubt. In 2011, however, historian Thomas Baker discovered a previously unknown letter from William P. Van Ness to Edward Livingston, two leading Democratic-Republicans in New York. Van Ness was very close to Burr, serving as his second in the duel with Alexander Hamilton. As a leading Democratic-Republican, Van Ness secretly supported the Federalist plan to elect Burr as president and tried to get Livingston to join. Livingston agreed at first, then reversed himself. Baker argues that Burr probably supported the Van Ness plan: &quot;There is a compelling pattern of circumstantial evidence, much of it newly discovered, that strongly suggests Aaron Burr did exactly that as part of a stealth campaign to compass the presidency for himself.&quot; The attempt did not work, however, at least in part because of Livingston&#x27;s reversal and especially Hamilton&#x27;s vigorous opposition to Burr. Jefferson was ultimately elected president, and Burr vice president.

==Vice presidency (1801–1805)==
Jefferson never trusted Burr, so he was effectively shut out of party matters. As vice president, Burr earned praise from some enemies for his even-handedness and his judicial manner as President of the Senate; he fostered some practices for that office that have become time-honored traditions. Burr&#x27;s judicial manner in presiding over the impeachment trial of Justice Samuel Chase has been credited as helping to preserve the principle of judicial independence that was established by &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; in 1803. One newspaper wrote that Burr had conducted the proceedings with the &quot;impartiality of an angel, but with the rigor of a devil&quot;.

Burr was not nominated to a second term as Jefferson&#x27;s running mate in the 1804 election, and Clinton replaced Burr as vice president on March 4, 1805. Burr&#x27;s farewell speech on March 2, 1805, moved some of his harshest critics in the Senate to tears. But the 20-minute speech was never recorded in full, and has been preserved only in short quotes and descriptions of the address, which defended the American system of government.

===Duel with Hamilton===

When it became clear that Jefferson would drop Burr from his ticket in the 1804 election, Burr ran for governor of New York instead. He lost the gubernatoral election to little known Morgan Lewis, in what was the most significant margin of loss in the state&#x27;s history up to that time. Burr blamed his loss on a personal smear campaign believed to have been orchestrated by his party rivals, including Clinton. Hamilton also opposed Burr, due to his belief that Burr had entertained a Federalist secession movement in New York. In April, the &quot;Albany Register&quot; published a letter from Dr. Charles D. Cooper to Senator Philip Schuyler, which relayed Hamilton&#x27;s judgment that Burr was &quot;a dangerous man and one who ought not to be trusted with the reins of government,&quot; and claiming to know of &quot;a still more despicable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr&quot;. In June, Burr sent this letter to Hamilton, seeking an affirmation or disavowal of Cooper&#x27;s characterization of Hamilton&#x27;s remarks.

Hamilton replied that Burr should give specifics of his remarks, not Cooper&#x27;s, and said he could not answer regarding Cooper&#x27;s interpretation. A few more letters followed, in which the exchange escalated to Burr&#x27;s demanding that Hamilton recant or deny any statement disparaging Burr&#x27;s honor over the past fifteen years. Hamilton, having already been disgraced by the Maria Reynolds adultery scandal and mindful of his reputation and honor, did not. According to historian Thomas Fleming, Burr would have immediately published such an apology, and Hamilton&#x27;s remaining power in the New York&#x27;s Federalist party would have been diminished. Burr responded by challenging Hamilton to a duel, personal combat then formalized under rules known as &quot;code duello&quot;.

Dueling was outlawed in New York; the sentence for conviction of dueling was death. It also was illegal in New Jersey, but the criminal ramifications were less severe. On July 11, 1804, the enemies met outside Weehawken, New Jersey, at the same location where Hamilton&#x27;s oldest son had been killed in a duel three years earlier. Both men fired, and Hamilton was mortally wounded by a shot just above the hip.

The observers disagreed on who fired first. They did agree that there was a three-to-four-second interval between the first and the second shot, raising difficult questions in evaluating the two camps&#x27; versions. Historian William Weir speculated that Hamilton might have been undone by his machinations: secretly setting his pistol&#x27;s trigger to require only a half-pound of pressure as opposed to the usual ten pounds. Weir contends, &quot;There is no evidence that Burr even knew that his pistol had a set trigger.&quot; Louisiana State University history professors Nancy Isenberg and Andrew Burstein concur with this, noting that &quot;Hamilton brought the pistols, which had a larger barrel than regular dueling pistols, and a secret , and were therefore much more deadly,&quot; and conclude that &quot;Hamilton gave himself an unfair advantage in their duel, and got the worst of it anyway.&quot; However, other accounts state that Hamilton reportedly responded &quot;not this time&quot; when his second, Nathaniel Pendleton, asked whether he would set the hair-trigger feature.

David O. Stewart, in his biography of Burr, &quot;American Emperor&quot;, notes that the reports of Hamilton&#x27;s intentionally missing Burr with his shot began to be published in newspaper reports in papers friendly to Hamilton only in the days after his death. However, Ron Chernow, in his 2004 biography &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;, states that Hamilton told numerous friends well before the duel of his intention to avoid firing at Burr. Additionally, Hamilton wrote several letters, including a &quot;Statement on Impending Duel With Aaron Burr&quot; and his last missives to his wife dated before the duel, which also attest to his intention. The second shot, witnesses reported, followed so soon after the first that witnesses could not agree on who fired first. Before the duel proper, Hamilton took a good deal of time getting used to the feel and weight of the pistol and putting on his glasses to see his opponent more clearly. The seconds placed Hamilton so that Burr would have the rising sun behind him, and during the brief duel, one witness reported, Hamilton seemed to be hindered by this placement as the sun was in his eyes.

Each man took one shot. Burr&#x27;s shot fatally injured Hamilton. While it is unclear whether Hamilton&#x27;s was purposely fired into the air, Burr&#x27;s bullet entered Hamilton&#x27;s abdomen above his right hip, piercing his liver and spine. Hamilton was evacuated to the Manhattan residence of his friend, William Bayard Jr., where he and his family received visitors including Episcopal bishop Benjamin Moore, who gave Hamilton last rites. Burr was charged with multiple crimes, including murder, in New York and New Jersey, but was never tried in either jurisdiction.

Burr fled to South Carolina, where his daughter lived with her family, but soon returned to Philadelphia and then to Washington, D.C. to complete his term as vice president. He avoided New York and New Jersey for a time, but all the charges against him were eventually dropped. In the case of New Jersey, the indictment was thrown out on the basis that, although Hamilton was shot in New Jersey, he died in New York.

==Post-vice presidency (1805–1836)==
===Conspiracy and trial===

After Burr left the vice presidency at the end of his term in 1805, he journeyed to the western frontier, areas west of the Allegheny Mountains and down the Ohio River Valley, eventually reaching the lands acquired in the Louisiana Purchase. He leased 40,000 acres (16,000 ha) of land, known as the Bastrop Tract, along the Ouachita River, in present-day Louisiana, from the Spanish government. Starting in Pittsburgh and then proceeding to Beaver, Pennsylvania and Wheeling, Virginia, and onward, he drummed up support for his planned settlement, whose purpose and status was unclear.

Burr&#x27;s most important contact was General James Wilkinson, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army at New Orleans, and governor of the Louisiana Territory. Others included Harman Blennerhassett, who offered the use of his private island for training and outfitting Burr&#x27;s expedition. Wilkinson later proved to be a bad choice.

Burr envisioned the probability of the Spanish-American War. In case war was declared, Andrew Jackson, then commander of Tennessee&#x27;s militia, stood ready to assist Burr. Burr&#x27;s expedition of about eighty men carried modest arms for hunting and no war materiel was ever revealed even when Blennerhassett Island was seized by Ohio&#x27;s militia. Burr vowed the aim of his conspiracy was that if he settled there with a large group of armed farmers and war broke out, he would likely face a force with which to fight and claim land for himself thereby restoring his wealth. However, the war did not emerge as soon as Burr expected. In 1819, the Adams–Onís Treaty secured Florida for the U.S. without a fight, and war in Texas did not commence until 1836, the year Burr died.

After a near-incident with Spanish forces at Natchitoches, Wilkinson decided he could best serve his conflicting interests by betraying Burr&#x27;s plans to his Spanish spymasters and to President Jefferson. Jefferson issued an order for Burr&#x27;s arrest, declaring him a traitor before any indictment. Burr read this in a newspaper in the Territory of Orleans on January 10, 1807. Jefferson&#x27;s warrant put federal agents on his trail. Burr twice turned himself in to federal authorities, and both times judges found his actions legal and released him.

Jefferson&#x27;s warrant, however, followed Burr, who fled toward Spanish Florida. He was intercepted at Wakefield, in Mississippi Territory in present-day Alabama, on February 19, 1807, by Edmund P. Gaines and Nicholas Perkins III. He was confined to Fort Stoddert after being arrested on charges of treason.

Burr&#x27;s secret correspondence with Anthony Merry and the Marquis of Casa Yrujo, the British and Spanish ministers in Washington, D.C., were eventually revealed. Burr tried to secure money and conceal what may have been his true design, which was aiding Mexico in overthrowing the Kingdom of Spain&#x27;s governance of the Southwest. If Burr intended to establish a dynasty in what later became Mexican territory, such an offense at the time was a misdemeanor under the Neutrality Act of 1794, which Congress passed to block filibuster expeditions against U.S. neighbors, including those of George Rogers Clark and William Blount. Despite this, Thomas Jefferson sought the highest charges against Burr.

In 1807, Burr was charged with treason in U.S. circuit court in Richmond, Virginia. His defense lawyers included Edmund Randolph, John Wickham, Luther Martin, and Benjamin Gaines Botts. Burr was arraigned four times for treason priot to being indicted before a grand jury. The only physical evidence presented to the grand jury was Wilkinson&#x27;s letter from Burr, which proposed stealing land in the Louisiana Purchase. During the grand jury&#x27;s deliberations, however, the court discovered that the letter was written in Wilkinson&#x27;s handwriting. He said he had made a copy because he had lost the original. The grand jury dismissed the letter out as evidence, and the news made a laughingstock of Wilkinson for the rest of the proceedings.

The trial, which was presided over by Chief Justice John Marshall, began on August 3. Article 3, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution requires that treason either be admitted in open court or proven by an overt act witnessed by two people. Since no witnesses came forward, Burr was acquitted on September 1, despite efforts by the Jefferson administration to exert its political influence against him in the trial. Burr was immediately tried on a misdemeanor charge and was again acquitted.

Jefferson used his influence as president to seek Burr&#x27;s conviction, leading the trial to be seen as a major test of the U.S. Constitution and the separation of powers. Jefferson challenged the authority of the Supreme Court and Chief Justice Marshall, who was appointed by John Adams and clashed with Jefferson over Adams&#x27; last-minute judicial appointments. Jefferson believed that Burr&#x27;s treason was obvious. Burr sent a letter to Jefferson in which he stated that he could do Jefferson much harm. The case, as tried, was decided on whether Burr was present at certain events at certain times and in certain capacities. Jefferson used all of his influence to attempt in an attempt to convince Marshall to convict Burr, but Marshall was not swayed.

Historians Nancy Isenberg and Andrew Burstein write that Burr:
David O. Stewart, on the other hand, alleged that Burr was not explicitly guilty of treason, according to Marshall&#x27;s definition, but evidence existed linking him to treasonous crimes. Bollman admitted to Jefferson during an interrogation that Burr planned to raise an army and invade Mexico. He said that Burr believed that he should be Mexico&#x27;s monarch, since a republican government, in Burr&#x27;s view, was not appropriate for Mexico. Many historians believe the extent of Burr&#x27;s involvement may never be known.

===Exile and return===
By the conclusion of his trial for treason, despite an acquittal, all of Burr&#x27;s hopes for a political comeback had been dashed, and he fled America and his creditors for Europe. Dr. David Hosack, Hamilton&#x27;s physician and a friend to both Hamilton and Burr, lent Burr money for passage on a ship.

Burr lived in self-imposed exile from 1808 to 1812, passing most of this period in England, where he occupied a house on Craven Street, London. He became a good friend, even confidant, of the English Utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham, and on occasion lived at Bentham&#x27;s home. He also spent time in Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and France. Ever hopeful, he solicited funding for renewing his plans for a conquest of Mexico but was rebuffed. He was ordered out of England and Emperor Napoleon of France refused to receive him. However, one of his ministers held an interview concerning Burr&#x27;s goals for Spanish Florida or the British West Indies.

After returning from Europe, Burr used the surname &quot;Edwards&quot;, his mother&#x27;s maiden name, for a while to avoid creditors. With help from old friends Samuel Swartwout and Matthew L. Davis, Burr returned to New York City and his law practice. Later he helped the heirs of the Eden family in a financial lawsuit. By the early 1820s, the remaining members of the Eden household, Eden&#x27;s widow and two daughters, had become a surrogate family to Burr.

===Later life===
Despite financial setbacks, Burr lived out the remainder of his life in New York in relative peace until 1833. On July 1 of that year, at age 77, he married Eliza Jumel, a wealthy widow who was nineteen years his junior. They lived together briefly at her residence which she had acquired with her first husband, the Morris-Jumel Mansion in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is now preserved and open to the public.

Soon after the marriage, Jumel realized her fortune was dwindling due to Burr&#x27;s land speculation losses, and separated from him after four months of marriage. She chose Alexander Hamilton Jr. as her divorce lawyer in 1834, the same year Burr suffered an immobilizing stroke.

==Death==

Burr died in a boarding house in Port Richmond, New York, on Staten Island, on September 14, 1836, at age 80, the same day that his divorce was officially completed. The house later became known as the St. James Hotel. He was buried near his father&#x27;s gravesite in Princeton, New Jersey.

==Personal life==
In addition to his daughter Theodosia, Burr was the father of at least three other children and he adopted two sons. Burr also acted as a parent to his two stepsons by his wife&#x27;s first marriage and he became a mentor or guardian to several protégés who lived in his home.

===Burr&#x27;s daughter Theodosia===
Theodosia Burr Alston was born in 1783 and was named after her mother. She was the only child of Burr&#x27;s marriage to Theodosia Bartow Prevost who survived to adulthood. A second daughter, Sally, lived to the age of three. Two unnamed stillborns arrived later, with the first son in February 1787 and the second on July 9, 1788.

Burr was a devoted and attentive father to Theodosia. Believing that a young woman should have an education equal to that of a young man, he prescribed a rigorous course of studies for her which included the classics, French, horsemanship and music. Their surviving correspondence indicates that he affectionately treated his daughter as a close friend and confidante as long as she lived.

Theodosia became widely known for her education and accomplishments. In 1801, she married Joseph Alston of South Carolina. They had a son together, Aaron Burr Alston, who died of fever at age ten. During the winter of 1812–1813, Theodosia was lost at sea with the schooner &quot;Patriot&quot; off the Carolinas. Although it is unknown what truly happened to Theodosia and the other passengers, the most common theories are that they were either murdered by pirates or shipwrecked in a storm.

===Stepchildren and protégés===

Upon Burr&#x27;s marriage, he became stepfather to the two teenage sons of his wife&#x27;s first marriage. Augustine James Frederick Prevost (called &quot;Frederick&quot;) and John Bartow Prevost had both joined their father in the Royal American Regiment in December 1780, at the ages of 16 and 14. When they returned in 1783 to become citizens of the United States, Burr acted as a father to them: he assumed responsibility for their education, gave both of them clerkships in his law office and frequently was accompanied by one of them as an assistant when he traveled on business. John was later appointed by Jefferson to a post in the Territory of Orleans as the first judge of the Louisiana Supreme Court.
Burr served as a guardian to Nathalie de Lage de Volude (1782–1841) from 1794 to 1801, during Theodosia&#x27;s childhood. The young daughter of a French marquis, Nathalie was taken to New York for safety during the French Revolution by her governess, Caroline de Senat. Burr opened his home to them, allowing Madame Senat to tutor private students there along with his daughter, and Nathalie became a companion and close friend to Theodosia. While traveling to France for an extended visit in 1801, Nathalie met Thomas Sumter Jr., a diplomat and the son of General Thomas Sumter. They married in Paris in March 1802, before returning to his home in South Carolina. From 1810 to 1821 they lived in Rio de Janeiro, where Sumter served as the American ambassador to Portugal during the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil. One of their children, Thomas De Lage Sumter, was a Congressman from South Carolina.

In the 1790s, Burr also took the painter John Vanderlyn into his home as a protégé, and provided him with financial support and patronage for 20 years. He arranged Vanderlyn&#x27;s training by Gilbert Stuart in Philadelphia and sent him in 1796 to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he remained for six years.

===Adopted and acknowledged children===
Burr adopted two sons, Aaron Columbus Burr and Charles Burdett, during the 1810s and 1820s after the death of his daughter Theodosia. Aaron (born Aaron Burr Columbe) was born in Paris in 1808 and arrived in America around 1815, and Charles was born in 1814. Both of the boys were reputed to be Burr&#x27;s biological sons. A Burr biographer described Aaron Columbus Burr as &quot;the product of a Paris adventure&quot;, conceived presumably during Burr&#x27;s exile from the United States between 1808 and 1814.

In 1835, the year before his death, Burr acknowledged two young daughters whom he had fathered late in his life, by different mothers. Burr made specific provisions for his surviving daughters in a will dated January 11, 1835, in which he left &quot;all the rest and residue&quot; of his estate, after other specific bequests, to six-year-old Frances Ann (born ), and two-year-old Elizabeth (born ).


===Unacknowledged children===
In 1787 or earlier, Burr began a relationship with Mary Emmons (called &quot;Eugenie&quot;), who may have been East Indian. She worked as a servant in his household during his first marriage. Emmons may have come from Calcutta to Saint-Domingue or Haiti before coming to America. Burr fathered two children with Emmons, both of whom married into Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Free Negro&quot; community in which their families became prominent:
* Louisa Burr (Webb) (Darius) (-1878) worked most of her life as a valued servant in the home of Elizabeth Powel Francis Fisher, a prominent Philadelphia society matron, and later in the home of her son Joshua Francis Fisher. She was married to Francis Webb (1788–1829), a founding member of the Pennsylvania Augustine Education Society, secretary of the Haytien Emigration Society formed in 1824, and distributor of &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Journal&quot; from 1827 to 1829. After his death, Louisa remarried and became Louisa Darius. Her youngest son Frank J. Webb wrote the 1857 novel &quot;The Garies and Their Friends&quot;.
* John Pierre Burr (–1864) became a member of Philadelphia&#x27;s Underground Railroad and served as an agent for the abolitionist newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot;. He worked in the National Black Convention movement and served as chairman of the American Moral Reform Society.

One contemporary of John Pierre Burr identified him as a natural son of Burr in a published account, but Burr never acknowledged his relationship or children with Emmons during his life, in contrast to his adoption or acknowledgment of other children born later in his life.

In 2018, Louisa and John were acknowledged by the Aaron Burr Association as the children of Burr after Sherri Burr, a descendant of John Pierre, provided both documentary evidence and results of a DNA test to confirm a familial link between descendants of Burr and descendants of Pierre. The Association installed a headstone at Pierre&#x27;s grave to mark his ancestry. Stuart Fisk Johnson, the president of the Association, commented, &quot;A few people didn&#x27;t want to go into it because Aaron&#x27;s first wife, Theodosia, was still alive, and dying of cancer [when Aaron fathered Pierre] ... But the embarrassment is not as important as it is to acknowledge and embrace actual living, robust, accomplished children.&quot;

==Character==
Burr was a man of complex character who made many friends, but also many powerful enemies. He was indicted for murder after the death of Hamilton, but never prosecuted; he was reported by acquaintances to be curiously unmoved by Hamilton&#x27;s death, expressing no regret for his role in the result. He was arrested and prosecuted for treason by President Jefferson, but acquitted. Although the charges were dropped, Burr remained distrusted by contemporaries for the rest of his life.

In his later years in New York, Burr provided money and education for several children, some of whom were reputed to be his natural children. To his friends and family, and often to strangers, he could be kind and generous. Jane Fairfield, the wife of the struggling poet Sumner Lincoln Fairfield, recorded in her autobiography that in the late 1820s, their friend Burr pawned his watch to provide for the care of the Fairfields&#x27; two children. Jane wrote that, while traveling, she and her husband had left the children in New York with their grandmother, who proved unable to provide adequate food or heat for them. The grandmother took the children to Burr&#x27;s home and asked his help: &quot;[Burr] wept, and replied, &#x27;Though I am poor and have not a dollar, the children of such a mother shall not suffer while I have a watch.&#x27; He hastened on this godlike errand, and quickly returned, having pawned the article for twenty dollars, which he gave to make comfortable my precious babes.&quot;

By Fairfield&#x27;s account, Burr had lost his religious faith before that time; upon seeing a painting of Jesus&#x27; suffering, Burr candidly told her, &quot;It is a fable, my child; there never was such a being.&quot;

Burr believed women to be intellectually equal to men and hung a portrait of Mary Wollstonecraft over his mantel. The Burrs&#x27; daughter, Theodosia, was taught dance, music, several languages and learned to shoot from horseback. Until her death at sea in 1813, she remained devoted to her father. Not only did Burr advocate education for women, upon his election to the New York legislature, he submitted a bill, which failed to pass, that would have allowed women to vote. Hamilton attacked Burr for supporting the idea that women were the intellectual equals of men.

Burr was considered a notorious womanizer. In addition to cultivating relationships with women in his social circles, his journals indicate that he was a frequent patron of prostitutes during his travels in Europe; he recorded brief notes of dozens of such encounters, and the amounts he paid. He described &quot;sexual release as the only remedy for his restlessness and irritability&quot;.

Burr also fought against anti-immigrant sentiment, led by Hamilton&#x27;s Federalist party, which suggested that anyone without English heritage was a second-class citizen and even challenged the rights of non-Anglos to hold office. In response, Burr insisted that anyone who contributed to society deserved all the rights of any other citizen, no matter their background.

John Quincy Adams wrote in his diary when Burr died: &quot;Burr&#x27;s life, take it all together, was such as in any country of sound morals his friends would be desirous of burying in quiet oblivion.&quot; Adams&#x27; father, President John Adams, had frequently defended Burr during his life. At an earlier time, he wrote, Burr &quot;had served in the army, and came out of it with the character of a knight without fear and an able officer&quot;.

Gordon S. Wood, a leading scholar of the revolutionary period, holds that it was Burr&#x27;s character that put him at odds with the rest of the Founding Fathers, especially Madison, Jefferson and Hamilton. He believed that this led to his personal and political defeats and, ultimately, to his place outside the golden circle of revered revolutionary figures. Because of his habit of placing self-interest above the good of the whole, those men thought that Burr represented a serious threat to the ideals for which they had fought the revolution. Their ideal, as particularly embodied in Washington and Jefferson, was that of &quot;disinterested politics,&quot; a government led by educated gentlemen. They would fulfill their duties in a spirit of public virtue and without regard to personal interests or pursuits. This was the core of an Enlightenment gentleman, and Burr&#x27;s political enemies thought that he lacked that essential core. Hamilton thought that Burr&#x27;s self-serving nature made him unfit to hold office, especially the presidency. Hamilton believed it &quot;a religious duty to oppose his career&quot;, as he wrote in 1792.

Although Hamilton considered Jefferson a political enemy, he also believed him a man of public virtue. Hamilton conducted an unrelenting campaign in the House of Representatives to prevent Burr&#x27;s election to the presidency and gain election of his erstwhile enemy, Jefferson. Hamilton characterized Burr as exceedingly immoral, as well as &quot;unprincipled &amp; dangerous.&quot; Hamilton deemed his political quest as one for &quot;permanent power.&quot; He contended that Burr cared little about the Constitution and predicted that if he gained any more power, his leadership would continue to be for personal gain, while Jefferson was a true patriot and public servant committed to preserving the Constitution.

==Legacy==

Although Burr is often remembered primarily for his duel with Hamilton, his establishment of guides and rules for the first impeachment trial set a high bar for behavior and procedures in the Senate chamber, many of which are followed today.

Historian Nancy Isenberg, seeking to explain Burr&#x27;s negative image in modern times, wrote that his portrayal as a villain is actually the result of a smear campaign invented by his political enemies centuries ago, and then disseminated in newspapers, pamphlets and personal letters during and after his lifetime. According to Isenberg, pop-cultural portraits of Burr have repeated these distortions, transforming him into the quintessential &quot;bad guy&quot; of early American history. Stuart Fisk Johnson describes Burr as progressive thinker and doer, a brave military patriot and brilliant lawyer who helped establish some of the physical infrastructure and guiding legal principles which helped in the founding of America.

A lasting consequence of Burr&#x27;s role in the election of 1800 was the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which changed how vice presidents were chosen. As was evident from the 1800 election, the situation could quickly arise where the vice president, as the defeated presidential candidate, could not work well with the president. The Twelfth Amendment required that electoral votes be cast separately for president and vice president.

Burr is also sometimes seen as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, although this characterization is unusual.

===Representation in literature and popular culture===

<doc id="57455" wikidata="Q218778" url="?curid=57455" title="Sago">
<text>Sago () is a starch extracted from the pith, or spongy core tissue, of various tropical palm stems, especially those of &quot;Metroxylon sagu&quot;. It is a major staple food for the lowland peoples of New Guinea and the Maluku Islands, where it is called &quot;saksak&quot;, &quot;rabia&quot; and &quot;sagu&quot;. The largest supply of sago comes from Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. Large quantities of sago are sent to Europe and North America for cooking purposes. It is traditionally cooked and eaten in various forms, such as rolled into balls, mixed with boiling water to form a glue-like paste (papeda), or as a pancake.

Sago is often produced commercially in the form of &quot;pearls&quot; (small rounded starch aggregates, partly gelatinized by heating). Sago pearls can be boiled with water or milk and sugar to make a sweet sago pudding. Sago pearls are similar in appearance to the pearled starches of other origin, e.g. cassava starch (tapioca) and potato starch. They may be used interchangeably in some dishes, and tapioca pearls are often marketed as &quot;sago&quot;, since they are much cheaper to produce. Compared to tapioca pearls, real sago pearls are off-white, uneven in size, brittle and cook very quickly.

The name &quot;sago&quot; is also sometimes used for starch extracted from other sources, especially the sago cycad, &quot;Cycas revoluta&quot;. The sago cycad is also commonly known as the sago palm, although this is a misnomer as cycads are not palms. Extracting edible starch from the sago cycad requires special care due to the poisonous nature of cycads. Cycad sago is used for many of the same purposes as palm sago.

The fruit of palm trees from which the sago is produced is not allowed to ripen fully, as full ripening completes the life cycle of the tree and exhausts the starch reserves in the trunk to produce the seeds to the point of death, leaving a hollow shell. The palms are cut down when they are about 15 years old, just before or shortly after the inflorescence appears. The stems, which grow high, are split out. The starch-containing pith is taken from the stems and ground to powder. The powder is kneaded in water over a cloth or sieve to release the starch. The water with the starch passes into a trough where the starch settles. After a few washings, the starch is ready to be used in cooking. A single palm yields about of dry starch.

== Historical records ==
Sago was noted by the Chinese historian Zhao Rukuo (1170–1231) during the Song dynasty. In his &quot;Zhu Fan Zhi&quot; (1225), a collection of descriptions of foreign countries, he writes that the kingdom of Boni &quot;produces no wheat, but hemp and rice, and they use &quot;sha-hu&quot; (sago) for grain&quot;.

==Sources, extraction and preparation==

===Palm sago===
The sago palm, &quot;Metroxylon sagu&quot;, is found in tropical lowland forest and freshwater swamps across Southeast Asia and New Guinea and is the primary source of sago. It tolerates a wide variety of soils and may reach 30 meters in height (including the leaves). Several other species of the genus &quot;Metroxylon&quot;, particularly &quot;Metroxylon salomonense&quot; and &quot;Metroxylon amicarum&quot;, are also used as sources of sago throughout Melanesia and Micronesia.

Sago palms grow very quickly, in clumps of different ages similar to bananas, one sucker matures, then flowers and dies. It is replaced by another sucker, with up to 1.5 m of vertical stem growth per year. The stems are thick and are either self-supporting or have a moderate climbing habit; the leaves are pinnate. Each palm trunk produces a single inflorescence at its tip at the end of its life. Sago palms are harvested at the age of 7–15 years, just before or shortly after the inflorescence appears and when the stems are full of starch stored for use in reproduction. One palm can yield 150–300 kg of starch.
Sago is extracted from &quot;Metroxylon&quot; palms by splitting the stem lengthwise and removing the pith which is then crushed and kneaded to release the starch before being washed and strained to extract the starch from the fibrous residue. The raw starch suspension in water is then collected in a settling container.

===Cycad sago===
The sago cycad, &quot;Cycas revoluta&quot;, is a slow-growing wild or ornamental plant. Its common names &quot;sago palm&quot; and &quot;king sago palm&quot; are misnomers as cycads are not palms. Processed starch known as sago is made from this and other cycads. It is a less-common food source for some peoples of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Unlike palms, cycads are highly poisonous: most parts of the plant contain the neurotoxins cycasin and BMAA. Consumption of cycad seeds has been implicated in the outbreak of Parkinson&#x27;s disease-like neurological disorder in Guam and other locations in the Pacific. Thus, before any part of the plant may safely be eaten the toxins must be removed through extended processing.

Sago is extracted from the sago cycad by cutting the pith from the stem, root and seeds of the cycads, grinding the pith to a coarse flour, before being dried, pounded, and soaked. The starch is then washed carefully and repeatedly to leach out the natural toxins. The starchy residue is then dried and cooked, producing a starch similar to palm sago/sabudana.

===Cassava sago===
In many countries including Australia, Brazil, and India, tapioca pearls made from cassava root are also referred to as &quot;sago&quot;, &quot;sagu&quot;, &quot;sabudana&quot;, etc.

==Uses==

===Nutrition===
Sago from &quot;Metroxylon&quot; palms is nearly pure carbohydrate and has very little protein, vitamins, or minerals. of dry sago typically comprises 94 grams of carbohydrate, 0.2 grams of protein, 0.5 grams of dietary fiber, 10 mg of calcium, 1.2 mg of iron and negligible amounts of fat, carotene, thiamine and ascorbic acid and yields approximately of food energy. Sago palms are typically found in areas unsuited for other forms of agriculture, so sago cultivation is often the most ecologically appropriate form of land-use and the nutritional deficiencies of the food can often be compensated for with other readily available foods.
Sago starch can be baked (resulting in a product analogous to bread, pancake, or biscuit) or mixed with boiling water to form a paste. It is a main staple of many traditional communities in New Guinea and Maluku in the form of papeda, Borneo, South Sulawesi (most known in Luwu Regency) and Sumatra. In Palembang, sago is one of the ingredients to make pempek. In Brunei, it is used for making the popular local dish called the ambuyat. It is also used commercially in making noodles and white bread. Sago starch can also be used as a thickener for other dishes. It can be made into steamed puddings such as sago plum pudding.

In Malaysia, the traditional food &quot;keropok lekor&quot; (fish cracker) uses sago as one of its main ingredients. In the making of the popular keropok lekor of Losong in Kuala Terengganu, each kilogram of fish meat is mixed with half a kilogram of fine sago, with a little salt added for flavour. Tons of raw sago are imported each year into Malaysia to support the keropok lekor industry.

In 1805, two captured crew members of the shipwrecked schooner &quot;Betsey&quot; were kept alive until their escape from an undetermined island on a diet of sago.
Any starch can be pearled by heating and stirring small aggregates of moist starch, producing partly gelatinized dry kernels that swell but remain intact on boiling. Pearl sago closely resembles pearl tapioca. Both are typically small (about 2 mm diameter) dry, opaque balls. Both may be white (if very pure) or colored naturally gray, brown or black, or artificially pink, yellow, green, etc. When soaked and cooked, both become much larger, translucent, soft and spongy. Both are widely used in Indian, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan cuisine in a variety of dishes and around the world, usually in puddings. In India, it is used in a variety of dishes such as desserts boiled with sweetened milk on occasion of religious fasts.

The Penan people of Borneo have sago from Eugeissona palms as their staple carbohydrate.

===Textile production===
Sago starch is also used to treat fiber in a process is called sizing, which makes fibers easier to machine. The process helps to bind the fiber, give it a predictable slip for running on metal, standardize the level of hydration of the fiber and give the textile more body. Most of the natural based cloth and clothing has been sized; this leaves a residue which is removed in the first wash.

===Other uses===
Because many traditional people rely on sago-palm as their main food staple and because supplies are finite, in some areas commercial or industrial harvesting of wild stands of sago-palm can conflict with the food needs of local communities.

There is also a research conducted to potentially make use of the waste from sago palm industry as an adsorbent for cleaning up oil spills.

<text>Under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), Rosidae is a botanical name at the rank of subclass. Circumscription of the subclass will vary with the taxonomic system being used; the only requirement being that it includes the family Rosaceae.

Under Phylocode, Rosidae is a clade defined as the most inclusive crown clade containing &quot;Rosa cinnamomea&quot;, but not &quot;Berberidopsis corallina&quot; nor &quot;Dillenia indica&quot; nor &quot;Gunnera manicata&quot; nor &quot;Helianthus annuus&quot; nor &quot;Saxifraga mertensiana&quot; nor &quot;Stellaria media&quot; nor &quot;Viscum album&quot;.

A well-known example of Rosidae as governed by the ICN was in the Cronquist system. In the 1981, original, version of that system, the circumscription was as follows.

* subclass Rosidae
The Phylocode definition includes Crossosomatales, Geraniales, Myrtales, Fabidae (Celastrales, Cucurbitales, Fabales, Fagales, Huaceae, Oxalidales, Malpighiales, Rosales and Zygophyllales), Malvidae (Brassicales, Huerteales, Malvales, and Sapindales) as they are defined in the APG III system. This definition was formulated in 2007, and is agnostic on the inclusion or exclusion of Picramniales and Vitales. Since 2007, the phylogenetic positions of Picramniales and Vitales have been clarified. The position of Picramniales as sister to Malvidae sensu stricto requires it to be included among the rosids. Vitales is sister to the clade of all that must be included in the rosids and its inclusion is optional. In APG III, it was included.

There is considerable overlap between the two definitions. Some apparent differences are the result of more broadly drawn orders in the second. Apiales, Cornales, Proteales and Santalales, and parts of Rafflesiales (sensu Cronquist) are excluded from the second, and many groups from Cronquist&#x27;s Hamamelidae and Dillenidae are included.

In both senses, the term &quot;rosid&quot; applies, as an adjective and noun, to members of the group. In the APG III system, which eschewed formal botanical names between the ranks of class and order, the term &quot;rosids&quot; is used to define an informal clade corresponding to Rosidae as defined in the Phylocode.

<text>Banco Ambrosiano was an Italian bank that was established in 1896 and collapsed in 1982. The Vatican-based Institute for the Works of Religion, commonly known as the &quot;Vatican Bank&quot;, was Banco Ambrosiano&#x27;s main shareholder. The Vatican Bank was accused of funnelling covert United States funds to the Polish trade union Solidarity and to the Nicaraguan Contras through Banco Ambrosiano.

== Members ==

* Franco Ratti, chairman
* Carlo Canesi, senior manager then chairman of Banco Ambrosiano Holding starting from 1965
* Roberto Calvi, general manager of Banco Ambrosiano since 1971, appointed chairman from 1975 to his death in June 1982; he was often referred to as &quot;God&#x27;s Banker&quot; because of his close financial ties with the Vatican
* Paul Marcinkus, president of Vatican Bank (aka &quot;Istituto per le Opere di Religione&quot;), had been a director of Ambrosiano Overseas, based in Nassau, Bahamas
* Carlo De Benedetti became deputy-chairman for less than two months, after Roberto Calvi&#x27;s trial
* Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano is under Giovanni Bazoli
* Carlos Guido Natal Coda, head of the Argentine branch of Banco Ambrosiano (Coda is wrongly believed to be the predecessor of Emilio Massera as commander-in-chief of the Argentine Navy, which actually was Almirante Carlos Eduardo Álvarez Igarazbal &quot;)

== Before 1981 ==

The Banco Ambrosiano was founded in Milan in 1896 by Giuseppe Tovini, a Catholic lawyer and banker from Valle Camonica, and was named after Saint Ambrose, the fourth century archbishop of the city. Tovini&#x27;s purpose was to create a Catholic bank as a counterbalance to Italy&#x27;s &quot;lay&quot; banks, and its goals were &quot;serving moral organisations, pious works, and religious bodies set up for charitable aims.&quot; The bank came to be known as the &quot;priests&#x27; bank&quot;; one chairman was Franco Ratti, nephew to Pope Pius XI. In the 1960s, the bank began to expand its business, opening a holding company in Luxembourg in 1963 which came to be known as Banco Ambrosiano Holding. This was under the direction of Carlo Canesi, then a senior manager, and from 1965 chairman. His deputy was Roberto Calvi.

In 1971, Calvi became general manager, and in 1975 he was appointed chairman. Calvi expanded Ambrosiano&#x27;s interests, including the creation of off-shore companies in the Bahamas and South America; a controlling interest in the Banca Cattolica del Veneto; and funds for the publishing house Rizzoli to finance the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; newspaper (giving Calvi control behind the scenes for the benefit of his associates in the P2 masonic lodge). Calvi was a friend of American Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, president of the Istituto per le Opere di Religione (the formal name of the Vatican Bank), and involved both the IOR and Marcinkus in his dealings. 

Ambrosiano provided funds for political parties in Italy, and for both the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua and for its Sandinista opposition. There are rumours that it provided money for Solidarity in Poland. At Lugano, Banco del Gottardo, which was founded in 1957 with Dr. August Gansser-Burckhardt as president, became Banco Ambrosiano&#x27;s Swiss arm in 1963 with Swiss managers and a 45% stake indirectly through the Banco Ambrosiano Holding S. A., Luxembourg, which Banco Ambosiano held a 70% stake, and was the linchpin of Calvi&#x27;s offshore system with branches established in Nassau (Bahamas) and Luxembourg in the 1970s and after its failure Sumitomo Bank obtained Gotthardt Bank in 1984 and added the Monaco branch in 1994.

Calvi used his complex network of overseas banks and companies to move money out of Italy, to inflate share prices, and to secure massive unsecured loans. In 1978, the Banca d&#x27;Italia (Bank of Italy) produced a report on Ambrosiano that predicted future disaster and led to criminal investigations. Soon afterward the investigating Milanese magistrate, Alessandrini, was killed by a left-wing terrorist group, while the Bank of Italy official who superintended the inspection, Mario Sarcinelli, was imprisoned on charges that were later dismissed.

== After 1981 ==
In 1981, police raided the office of Propaganda Due to apprehend the Worshipful Master Licio Gelli and uncover further evidence against Roberto Calvi. Calvi was sentenced to four years prison. He was released pending appeal and retained his position at the bank. Carlo de Benedetti of Olivetti bought into the bank and became deputy chairman, only to leave two months later after receiving Mafia threats and a lack of co-operation from Calvi. His replacement, longtime employee Roberto Rosone, was wounded in a Mafia shooting. The criminal organization responsible was the &quot;Banda della Magliana&quot; (Magliana Gang) which had taken over Rome&#x27;s underworld in the late 1970s, and has been linked to political events of the &quot;anni di piombo&quot; (years of lead).

In 1982 the bank was unable to account for $1.287 billion (equivalent to $ in present-day terms). Calvi fled the country on a false passport, and Rosone arranged for the Bank of Italy to take over. Calvi&#x27;s personal secretary, Graziella Corrocher, left a note denouncing Calvi before leaping to her death from her office window. Calvi&#x27;s body was found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London on June 18.

During July 1982, funds to the off-shore interests were cut off, leading to their collapse, and in August the bank was replaced by the Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano under Giovanni Bazoli. Pope John Paul II pledged full transparency regarding the bank&#x27;s links to the Vatican and brought in lay bankers including German financial expert Hermann Abs, a move that was publicly criticized by Simon Wiesenthal, due to Abs&#x27; role as top banker to Nazi Germany from 1938 to 1945. There was much argument over who should take responsibility for losses incurred by the Old Ambrosiano&#x27;s off-shore companies, and the Holy See (Vatican) eventually agreed to pay out a substantial sum without accepting liability.

In April 1992, Carlo De Benedetti, former deputy chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, and 32 other people were convicted of fraud by a Milan court in connection with the bank&#x27;s collapse. Benedetti was sentenced to six years and four months in prison. His sentence was overturned in April 1998 by the Court of Cassation.

In 1994, former Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi was indicted in the Banco Ambrosiano case, along with Licio Gelli, head of Propaganda Due, and former Justice minister Claudio Martelli. In April 1998, the Court of Cassation confirmed Licio Gelli&#x27;s 12-year sentence for the Ambrosiano crash.

== Clearstream scandal ==
Just before the media revealed the Ambrosiano scandal, Gérard Soisson, the manager of the transaction clearing company Clearstream, was found dead in Corsica, two months after Ernest Backes&#x27; dismissal from Clearstream in May 1983. Banco Ambrosiano was one of the many banks to have unpublished accounts in Clearstream. Backes, formerly the third-ranking officer of Clearstream and a primary source for Denis Robert&#x27;s book on Clearstream&#x27;s scandal, &quot;Revelation$&quot;, claims he &quot;was fired because (he) knew too much about the Ambrosiano scandal. When Soisson died, the Ambrosiano affair wasn&#x27;t yet known as a scandal. (After it was revealed) I realized that Soisson and I had been at the crossroads. We moved all those transactions known later in the scandal to Lima and other branches. Nobody even knew there was a Banco Ambrosiano branch in Lima and other South American countries.&quot;

As of 2005, the Italian justice has opened up again the investigation concerning the murder of Roberto Calvi, Ambrosiano&#x27;s chairman, but it asked the support of Ernest Backes and will investigate Gerard Soisson&#x27;s death, according to Lucy Komisar. Licio Gelli, the headmaster of P2 Masonic Lodge, and the mafioso Giuseppe &quot;Pippo&quot; Calò are being prosecuted for the assassination of Roberto Calvi.

==Falklands war involvement==
France prohibited deliveries of Exocet AM39 missiles purchased by Peru to avoid the possibility of Peru giving them to Argentina, because they knew that payment would be made with a credit card from the Central Bank of Peru, but British intelligence had detected that the guarantee was a deposit of two hundred million dollars from the Banco Ambrosiano Andino, an owned subsidiary of the Banco Ambrosiano. An Italian investigation into Propaganda Due&#x27;s involvement in the arms trade uncovered a contract for 52 Exocets signed by Carlos Alberto Corti, an Argentinian naval officer and member of P2.

== Roberto Calvi&#x27;s 1982 murder ==
David Yallop believes that Calvi, with the assistance of P2, may have been responsible for the death of Albino Luciani who, as Pope John Paul I, was planning a reform of Vatican finances. This is one of many conspiracy theories about Luciani, who died of a heart attack. Calvi&#x27;s family maintains that he was an honest man manipulated by others. According to the magistrates who indicted Licio Gelli, P2&#x27;s &quot;Venerable Master&quot;, and Giuseppe Calò for Calvi&#x27;s murder, Gelli would have ordered his death for embezzling his and the mafia&#x27;s money, while the mafia wanted to prevent him revealing how Calvi helped its money laundering.

<text>Blackfriars Bridge is a road and foot traffic bridge over the River Thames in London, between Waterloo Bridge and Blackfriars Railway Bridge, carrying the A201 road. The north end is in the City of London near the Inns of Court and Temple Church, along with Blackfriars station. The south end is in the London Borough of Southwark, near the Tate Modern art gallery and the Oxo Tower. Opened in the 1860s, it replaced an earlier bridge from the 1760s.

==History==
The first fixed crossing at Blackfriars was a long toll bridge designed in an Italianate style by Robert Mylne and constructed with nine semi-elliptical arches of Portland stone. Beating designs by John Gwynn and George Dance, it took nine years to build, opening to the public in 1769. It was the third bridge across the Thames in the then built-up area of London, supplementing the ancient London Bridge, which dated from several centuries earlier, and Westminster Bridge. It was originally named &quot;William Pitt Bridge&quot; (after the Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder) as a dedication, but its informal name relating to the precinct within the City named after the Blackfriars Monastery, a Dominican priory which once stood nearby, was generally adopted. It was later made toll free.

The City of London Corporation was responsible for promoting it and the location between the other two bridges was chosen because it was realised that the disused wharfage of the lower River Fleet from the Thames to what became Ludgate Circus would allow access into the north bank without unduly disrupting the neighbourhood; hence its name of New Bridge Street. The Fleet can be seen discharging into the Thames at its north side. By taking an access road from its southern landing to a junction with the routes created to simplify passage between those bridges to its east and west to the south it would also add to those improvements. This created the junction at St George&#x27;s Circus between Westminster Bridge Road, Borough Road and the later named Blackfriars Road which crossed the largely open parish of Christchurch Surrey. The continuation to the south at the major junction at Elephant and Castle is therefore named London Road.

Although it was built of Portland stone the workmanship was very faulty. Between 1833 and 1840 extensive repairs were necessary, until at last it was decided to build a new bridge on the same site, which coincided with the creation of the Thames Embankment&#x27;s junction with the new Queen Victoria Street and required a major reconfiguration.

The original Blackfriars Bridge was dismantled in 1860. P.A. Thom &amp; Company won the contract for the bridge&#x27;s reconstruction, and they placed an order with Lloyds, Foster and Company for the required ironwork. However, P.A. Thom encountered difficulties in finding stable foundations for the bridge, which ultimately led to financial troubles. As a result, Lloyds, Foster and Company went bankrupt, suffering a loss of £250,000 on the project. The metalwork for the bridge was ultimately constructed by The Patent Shaft and Axletree Company, Wednesbury, following their acquisition of Lloyds, Foster and Company.

The present bridge which on 6 November 1869 was opened by Queen Victoria is long, consisting of five wrought iron arches built to a design by Joseph Cubitt. Cubitt also designed the adjacent rail bridge (now demolished) and it was a condition that the spans and piers of the two bridges be aligned. Like its predecessor it is owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. The Blackfriars and Southwark Bridges Act 1867 put the full length and its southern end within the city&#x27;s borders, in the parish of St Anne Blackfriars, and not in the adjoining borough of Southwark. Due to the volume of traffic over the bridge, it was widened between 1907 and 1910, from to its present .

On 14 September 1909 a tram line was opened across the newly widened bridge by the Lord Mayor of London, George Wyatt Truscott. It closed on 5 July 1952.

The bridge attracted some international attention in June 1982, when the body of Roberto Calvi, a former chairman of Italy&#x27;s largest private bank, was found hanging from one of its arches with five bricks and around $14,000 in three different currencies in his pockets. Calvi&#x27;s death was initially treated as suicide, but he was on the run from Italy accused of embezzlement and in 2002 forensic experts concluded that he had been murdered by the Mafia, to whom he was indebted. In 2005, five suspected members of the Mafia were tried in a Rome court for Calvi&#x27;s murder, but all were acquitted in June 2007 for lack of evidence.

==Decorations==
On the piers of the bridge are stone carvings of water birds by sculptor John Birnie Philip. On the East (downstream) side (i.e. the side closer to the Thames Estuary and North Sea), the carvings show marine life and seabirds; those on the West (upstream) side show freshwater birds – reflecting the role of Blackfriars as the tidal turning point.

On the north side of the bridge is a statue of Queen Victoria (funded by Sir Alfred Seale Haslam), to whom the bridge was dedicated.

At the north end of the bridge is a commemorative plaque documenting the bridge&#x27;s history, including its reopening in 1909 by Lord Mayor Truscott, accompanied by a relief of the coat of arms of the City of London Corporation.

The ends of the bridge are shaped like a pulpit in a reference to Black Friars.

==Railway station==
The bridge gave its name to Blackfriars Bridge railway station on the southern bank which opened in 1864 before closing to passengers in 1885 following the opening of what is today the main Blackfriars station. Blackfriars Bridge station continued as a goods stop until 1964 when it was completely demolished, and much of it redeveloped into offices.

The River Fleet empties into the Thames under the north end of Blackfriars Bridge. The structure was given Grade II listed status in 1972.

==In popular culture==
In 1774 the new bridge was mentioned in a popular song in Charles Dibdin&#x27;s opera &quot;The Waterman&quot;, referring to the boatmen who used to carry fashionable folks to Vauxhall Gardens and Ranelagh Gardens.


A Bailey bridge constructed over the River Rhine at Rees, Germany, in 1945 by the Royal Canadian Engineers (R.C.E.) was named &quot;Blackfriars Bridge&quot;, and, at 558 m (1814 ft) including the ramps at each end, was the longest Bailey bridge then constructed.

In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, &quot;Blackfriars Bridge&quot; was named as the home of an unknown order of monks who held the key to an angelic prison. The bridge is also featured in the lyrics of the song &quot;The Resurrectionist&quot; by the Pet Shop Boys.

In Louis A. Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Jack: Being An Account of the Curious Adventures of Mary &quot;Jacky&quot; Faber, Ship&#x27;s Boy&quot;, Jacky is introduced as an orphan in early 19th-century London who lives with her orphan gang under Blackfriars Bridge.

The bridge appears during the opening sequence of the film &quot;Happy-Go-Lucky&quot;, where the main character rides across it on a bicycle. In the 1998 spy film &quot;The Avengers&quot;, the bridge is destroyed by a tornado caused by a weather-changing machine built by a mad scientist when he causes a hurricane over London.

The bridge was featured in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2007). The Order of the Phoenix passes under it on their flight from number four, Privet Drive to Grimmauld Place.

In Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot; (2009), Heath Ledger&#x27;s character Tony is found hanging under the Blackfriars Bridge, described by Terry Gilliam as &quot;an homage to Roberto Calvi&quot;.

In Cassandra Clare&#x27;s book series &quot;The Infernal Devices&quot;, Tessa Gray and Jem Carstairs meet at the bridge every year from 1878 to 2008 except for 1941 as it was deemed too dangerous due to World War II. They also get married there.

<text>The Harrier is a medium-sized dog breed of the hound class, 
used for hunting hares by trailing them. It resembles an English Foxhound but is slightly smaller, though not as small as a Beagle. The breed has been used since the mid 13th century.

==Description==

===Appearance===
The Harrier is similar to the English Foxhound, but smaller. Harriers stand between 19 and 21 inches at the shoulder, and adults weigh between 45 and 65 lbs. They do shed, have short hair and hanging ears, and come in a variety of color patterns. A humorous description of a Harrier is that of &quot;a Beagle on steroids&quot;, despite its resemblance to an English Foxhound. It is a muscular hunting hound with a small, hard coat. It has large bones for stamina and strength. The Harrier is slightly longer than tall, with a level topline. The tail is medium-length, carried high, but is not curled over the back. The skull is broad with a strong square muzzle. The rounded ears are pendant, and the eyes are either brown or hazel. The wide nose is black. The expression is mellow when the dog is relaxed and alert when he is excited. The teeth should meet in a scissors or level bite. The feet are tight and cat-like, and the front toes may turn inward.

===Temperament===
The Harrier is cheerful, sweet-tempered, tolerant of people, and it is excellent with children. This pack dog is good with other dogs, but should be supervised with non-canine pets unless it is raised with them from puppyhood. It prefers life in a pack with people, dogs, or both. This active dog likes to go exploring, sniffing, and trailing, so be sure to keep it on a leash or in a safe enclosed area. Some Harriers like to bay.

==Health==
This breed&#x27;s lifespan is generally 12–15 years. Hip dysplasia is known to occur in this breed.

==Care==
The coat needs only occasional brushing to remove dead hair.

===Exercise===
The Harrier requires daily exercise, such as long vigorous walks or runs. Without appropriate exercise, the Harrier can become hyperactive, overweight and/or destructive. While this dog was bred to run and work all day long and cannot be satisfied by a completely sedentary lifestyle, they adapt very well to the average home.

==History==
Sources have widely conflicting stories about the origins of this breed. According to one, the earliest Harrier types were crossed with Bloodhounds, the Talbot Hound, and even the Basset Hound. According to another, the breed was probably developed from crosses of the English Foxhound with Fox Terrier and Greyhound. Yet another regards the Harrier as simply a bred-down version of the English Foxhound. Although there are many working Harriers in England, the breed is still not recognised in that country.

In any case, today&#x27;s Harrier is between the Beagle and English Foxhound in size and was developed primarily to hunt hares, though the breed has also been used in fox hunting. The name, &quot;Harrier&quot;, reveals the breed&#x27;s specialty - compare &quot;harehound&quot;. The Harrier has a long history of popularity as a working pack-dog in England.

The Harrier is the most commonly used hound by hunts in Ireland, with 166 harrier packs, 37 of them mounted packs and 129 of them foot packs, spread throughout the country. In Ireland it is used to hunt both foxes and hares, with some packs hunting mainly foxes.

Harriers in UK

In the Victorian era, the Harrier was included in the original Kennel Club Studbook(1874) as one of the only 40 breeds recognised by the document. The last time Harriers were shown at a Kennel Club show or entered in their Studbook was in 1915. The last time they were shown at Crufts was 1898

In 1891, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles (AMHB) was founded and registered 107 Harrier packs.

From the First World War until after the Second there was a significant decline not just in Harriers but in most breeds, working dogs and pet populations. Only Foxhounds received government support for food in order to manage the fox population. At the same time many privately owned Harrier packs hunted by the owners of large estates were disbanded. In the sporting Gazette of 1898 we read of the ‘Annual Leicester sale of Harriers’ at which the entire pack of 34 couple (68 hounds) belonging to the late Mr Carleton-Cowper was sold for a total of £550.10s. A further sale only a week later offered for sale 39 couple of hounds from three different packs. Such Harrier sales continued until soon after the WWII.

It was over ten years after the war that the MFHA with the support of the Kennel Club took a firm stand to ensure that in terms of breeding there was a clear distinction between Harriers bred for the purpose of Hunting and those bred for the bench shows and pet owners.

By the middle of the 20th Century, there were fewer than 50 Harrier packs and the AMHB banned the sale of registered Harriers and strictly controlled the breeding of dogs and sale of Harriers outside other registered packs, the result being that they all but disappeared outside the hunting community. The Kennel Club eventually withdraw breed recognition in the early 1970s.

By 2013, there were only 18 Harrier Packs in the UK. In 2022, there were only 13 Harrier Packs (eight Stud Book, five West Country): there were now under 750 Harriers left in the UK, only 300 West Country Harriers left in the World.

In France and the USA, Harrier enthusiasts kept the breed going. The French are the only ones with two dogs achieving World recognition with Iran des Coutas in 1974 and Alicien in 2011. In the USA, Emmy was BOB at Westminster Dog Show in 2018 and Whisper was BOB in 2020.

The Harrier was re-recognised by the UK Kennel Club in January 2020. As of 2022, there were over 50 pure bred Harriers registered with the KC.

At the World Dog Show 2021, British Harrier Ross Demon for Evforce was awarded the title of World Winner becoming only the third Harrier to be awarded this title (Iran de Coutas WW1974, Alician WW2011). In October 2021, the UK Kennel Club released the Interim Breed Standard, which meant that for the first time in 50 years Harriers could be shown under Kennel Club Rules. The first KC show was The Ladies Kennel Association in Birmingham on December 11, 2021 where 18 Harriers were entered in AVNSC (Any Variety Not Separately Classified). 
 Best Of Breed was &quot;Evforce Miss Havoc&quot; &quot;at Henissy&quot;. Best Puppy was &quot;Evforce Golden Agent&quot;. Best Veteran was &quot;Frenzy&quot; &quot;at Henissy&quot;. Crufts 2022 was to see 19 Harriers being shown for the first time in 124 years on Friday 11th. In 2022, The Best of Breed title was awarded to &quot;Evforce Miss Havoc at Henissy&quot; making her the first Harrier to be awarded Best of Breed since 1898. The Junior Clint  &quot;Evforce Clint West Gunner&quot; was awarded Reserve Best of Breed. &quot;Henissy Farthing&quot; was awarded Reserve Best Bitch.

In 1885, the American Kennel Club recognized the Harrier breed of dog, classified in the Hound Group.

The Harrier Club of America cites the earliest description of a Harrier in &quot;The Chace&quot; (by the English poet William Somervile) which was written in 1735.

<doc id="57484" wikidata="Q2281928" url="?curid=57484" title="Sidereal year">
<text>A sidereal year (, ; ), also called a sidereal orbital period, is the time that Earth or another planetary body takes to orbit the Sun once with respect to the fixed stars.

Hence, for Earth, it is also the time taken for the Sun to return to the same position relative to Earth with respect to the fixed stars after apparently travelling once around the ecliptic.

It equals for the J2000.0 epoch. The sidereal year differs from the solar year, &quot;the period of time required for the ecliptic longitude of the Sun to increase 360 degrees&quot;, due to the precession of the equinoxes.
The sidereal year is 20 min 24.5 s longer than the mean tropical year at J2000.0 .

At present, the rate of axial precession corresponds to a period of 25,772 years, so sidereal year is longer than tropical year by 1,224.5 seconds (20 min 24.5 s, ~365.24219*86400/25772).

Before the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes by Hipparchus in the Hellenistic period, the difference between sidereal and tropical year was unknown to the Greeks.
For naked-eye observation, the shift of the constellations relative to the equinoxes only becomes apparent over centuries or &quot;ages&quot;, and pre-modern calendars such as Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot; would give the times of the year for sowing, harvest, and so on by reference to the first visibility of stars, effectively using the sidereal year.
The Indian national calendar, based on the works of Maga Brahmins, as are the calendars of neighbouring countries, is traditionally reckoned by the Sun&#x27;s entry into the sign of Aries and is also supposed to align with the spring equinox and have relevance to the harvesting and planting season and thus the tropical year.
However, as the entry into the constellation occurs 25 days later, according to the astronomical calculation of the sidereal year, this date marks the South and Southeast Asian solar New Year in other countries and cultures

<text>WB Games Boston (formerly Turbine Inc., then Turbine Entertainment Software Corp., and originally CyberSpace, Inc.) is an American video game developer. 
The studio is best known for its massive multiplayer online role-playing games, &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot;, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot;, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;.

In April 2010, the company was acquired by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment for $160 million and became a part of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (now Warner Bros. Games), the video game division of Warner Bros. Entertainment.

==History==

Turbine was founded as CyberSpace, Inc. in April 1994 by Jeremy Gaffney, Jonathan Monserrat, Kevin Langevin, and Timothy Miller, some of whom were students from the Artificial Intelligence Lab at Brown University. In 1995, the company was based in Monserrat&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house with 12 staff members. They found an office in Providence, Rhode Island but later moved to Westwood, Massachusetts to better take advantage of the software engineers coming out of Boston&#x27;s colleges. As CEO, Monsarrat used free food and office pranks to keep staff motivated.

In 1995, the company changed its name to Turbine Entertainment Software Corp. In 1999, the company&#x27;s first game, &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot;, was released. It was notable for being the third 3D MMORPG, following the launch of &quot;Meridian 59&quot; and then &quot;EverQuest&quot;. Its most notable feature, designed by Monsarrat, was a &quot;loyalty&quot; system giving new and experienced players incentives to work together. The Olthoi was the first monster developed for &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot;, designed by Joe Angell.

After &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot;, the company went on to make a sequel, &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call 2: Fallen Kings&quot;, which came out in 2002 (just after the first &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot; expansion). However, after only one expansion, &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call 2: Fallen Kings&quot; shut down in 2005. In the same year, Turbine Entertainment Software Corp. changed its name to Turbine, Inc.

In 2006, Turbine released &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online: Stormreach&quot;. Early reception was positive, but the game was criticised for poor solo play. In 2007, Turbine released &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar&quot;, which got positive reviews and was seen as a needed boost for the company.

In 2009, &quot;Dungeons and Dragons Online&quot; was suffering a low playerbase; in an attempt to save the game, Turbine replaced the traditional monthly subscription model with a free to play one. In 2010, Turbine also moved &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot; (which was then on its second expansion) to a free-to-play model. In the same year, Turbine was purchased by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment for $160 million.

In 2012, Turbine brought back &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call 2: Fallen Kings&quot;.

The game&#x27;s development of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; ended on August 14, 2015.

The company was hit with layoffs for three years consecutively starting from 2014. While Turbine&#x27;s focus was shifted to develop free-to-play mobile games by Warner Bros. in 2016, the servers for both &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot; and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot; were maintained and supported.

By December 2016, Turbine was no longer involved with the development of &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot; or &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot;. Instead a spin-off studio under the name of &quot;Standing Stone Games&quot; was formed to take over further development of the game, with game staff moving from Turbine to the new studio. As part of this transition, Daybreak Game Company became the new publisher, taking over from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot; IP remained as a property of Turbine, and the servers for both &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot; and &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call 2: Fallen Kings&quot; were closed on January 31, 2017.

By November 2018, the studio was rebranded and became WB Games Boston.

<text>Erythronium, the fawn lily, trout lily, dog&#x27;s-tooth violet or adder&#x27;s tongue, is a genus of Eurasian and North American plants in the lily family, most closely related to tulips. The name Erythronium derives from Ancient Greek () &quot;red&quot; in Greek, referring to the red flowers of &quot;E. dens-canis&quot;. Of all the established species, most live in North America; only six species are found in Europe and Asia.

==Taxonomy==
It was published by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 with &quot;Erythronium dens-canis&quot; as the type species.
=== Species ===
&quot;Erythronium&quot; includes about 20–30 species of hardy spring-flowering perennial plants with long, tooth-like bulbs. Slender stems carry pendent flowers with recurved tepals in shades of cream, yellow, pink and mauve. Species are native to forests and meadows in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.

=== Formerly included ===
Two species names were coined using the name &quot;Erythronium&quot; but have since been reclassified to other taxa.
* &quot;Erythronium carolinianum&quot;, now called &quot;Uvularia perfoliata&quot;
* &quot;Erythronium hyacinthoides&quot;, now called &quot;Drimia indica&quot;

== Cultivation and uses ==
Erythroniums are widely grown as ornamental plants, with numerous hybrids and cultivars having been selected for garden use. Popular cultivars include &quot;Erythronium&quot; &#x27;Pagoda&#x27;, &quot;E.&quot; &#x27;Sundisc&#x27;, &quot;E.&quot; &#x27;Joanna&#x27;, &quot;E.&quot; &#x27;Kondo&#x27;, &quot;E.&quot; &#x27;Citronella&#x27;, &quot;E. californicum&quot; &#x27;White Beauty&#x27;, and &quot;E.&quot; &#x27;Rosalind&#x27;. Propagation is best by seed in autumn or by division of bulbs, depending on species. Some species propagate vegetatively. The plant is also great as a ground cover, as it will spread over several years.

Erythroniums are woodland plants and require rich soil, full of organic matter. Soil should be evenly moist and slightly acidic. They prefer shade or filtered sunlight.

The following cultivars, of mixed ancestry, have won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
*&#x27;Apple Blossom&#x27; (white with yellow centre)
*&#x27;Janice&#x27; (pink)
*&#x27;Joanna&#x27; (cream/pale yellow throat)
*&#x27;Pagoda&#x27; (cream yellow) 
*&#x27;Sundisc&#x27; (yellow)
*&#x27;Wildside Seedling&#x27; (white/yellow)
The bulb is edible as a root vegetable, cooked or dried, and can be ground into flour. The leaves can also be cooked as a leaf vegetable. In Japan, &quot;Erythronium japonicum&quot; is called &quot;katakuri&quot;, and the bulb is processed to produce starch, which is used for food and other purposes.

<text>&quot;Erythronium&quot; &#x27;Pagoda&#x27; is a cultivar of the genus &quot;Erythronium&quot; in the family Liliaceae. Its origin may be as a hybrid between &quot;Erythronium tuolumnense&quot; and &quot;Erythronium&quot; &#x27;White Beauty&#x27; (thought to be a cultivar of &quot;E. californicum&quot;). It flowers in early spring.

This plant prefers partial shade and a light soil, rich in humus. Tubers must not get too hot or too dry in summer.

Propagation is either by seed in autumn or by division of bulbs when the leaves die down in summer.

This plant has been awarded the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>Antlers are extensions of an animal&#x27;s skull found in members of the Cervidae (deer) family. Antlers are a single structure composed of bone, cartilage, fibrous tissue, skin, nerves, and blood vessels. They are generally found only on males, with the exception of reindeer/caribou. Antlers are shed and regrown each year and function primarily as objects of sexual attraction and as weapons.

==Etymology==
Antler comes from the Old French &quot;antoillier &quot;(see present French : &quot;Andouiller&quot;, from&quot; ant-, &quot;meaning before,&quot; oeil, &quot;meaning eye and&quot; -ier&quot;, a suffix indicating an action or state of being) possibly from some form of an unattested Latin word &quot;*anteocularis&quot;, &quot;before the eye&quot; (and applied to the word for &quot;branch&quot; or &quot;horn&quot;).

== Structure and development ==

Antlers are unique to cervids. The ancestors of deer had tusks (long upper canine teeth). In most species, antlers appear to replace tusks. However, one modern species (the water deer) has tusks and no antlers and the muntjacs have small antlers and tusks. The musk deer, which are not true cervids, also bear tusks in place of antlers.

In contrast to antlers, horns—found on pronghorns and bovids, such as sheep, goats, bison and cattle—are two-part structures that usually do not shed. A horn&#x27;s interior of bone is covered by an exterior sheath made of keratin (the same material as human fingernails and toenails).

Antlers are usually found only on males. Only reindeer (known as caribou in North America) have antlers on the females, and these are normally smaller than those of the males. Nevertheless, fertile from other species of deer have the capacity to produce antlers on occasion, usually due to increased testosterone levels. The &quot;horns&quot; of a pronghorn (which is not a cervid but a antilocaprid) meet some of the criteria of antlers, but are not considered true antlers because they contain keratin.
Each antler grows from an attachment point on the skull called a pedicle. While an antler is growing, it is covered with highly vascular skin called velvet, which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing bone. Antlers are considered one of the most exaggerated cases of male secondary sexual traits in the animal kingdom, and grow faster than any other mammal bone. Growth occurs at the tip, and is initially cartilage, which is later replaced by bone tissue. Once the antler has achieved its full size, the velvet is lost and the antler&#x27;s bone dies. This dead bone structure is the mature antler. In most cases, the bone at the base is destroyed by osteoclasts and the antlers fall off at some point. As a result of their fast growth rate, antlers are considered a handicap since there is an immense nutritional demand on deer to re-grow antlers annually, and thus can be honest signals of metabolic efficiency and food gathering capability.
In most Arctic and temperate-zone species, antler growth and shedding is annual, and is controlled by the length of daylight. Although the antlers are regrown each year, their size varies with the age of the animal in many species, increasing annually over several years before reaching maximum size. In tropical species, antlers may be shed at any time of year, and in some species such as the sambar, antlers are shed at different times in the year depending on multiple factors. Some equatorial deer never shed their antlers.

A 2019 study published in &quot;Science&quot; identified eight genes active in antler formation that are normally associated with bone cancer, particularly osteosarcoma. Additional tumor-suppressing and tumor-growth-inhibiting genes were determined to be responsible for regulating antler growth. This was taken to indicate that antler formation is more similar to a highly controlled form of cancer growth than to normal bone development.

Antlers function as both weapons in male-male competition and as displays of sexual ornaments for females. Because mature antlers are no longer living during combat, antler fractures are incapable of being repaired following competition. A study in 2019 hypothesized that the periodic casting and regrowth of antlers might have evolved as a way to ensure the availability of complete antler sets to display each year. Antler regeneration in male deer ensures that every mating season begins on a clean slate, as an increase in branching size and complexity happens each regeneration cycle in an individual.

== Mechanical properties ==
Bones typically serve a structural purpose, with load bearing abilities that are greater than any other part of an animal&#x27;s body. Bones typically differ in shape and properties to better fit their overall function. Antlers are not structural and typically have different properties when compared to structural bones like femurs.

While antlers are classified as bone, they differ in some ways from human bones and bovine bones. Bone is characterized as being made up of primarily collagen and a mineral phase. In antlers, the mineral content is considerably lower than other examples of bone tissue, while having a high volume of collagen. This leads antlers to having lower yield strength and stiffness, but higher fracture toughness when compared to human cortical bone. Mineral content differs among species and also depends on the food availability. In recent studies, increase in mineral content has been linked to the increase in stiffness with a decrease in fracture toughness. 

Further, bones are highly anisotropic due to their hierarchical structure. Thus, mechanical properties are highly dependent on testing conditions and directions. Due to their cylindrical shape, antlers can be tested using bending along three different orientations. Bend testing in these orientations have resulted in different mechanical properties. In samples from antler bone taken in the transverse direction, an elastic modulus of 8.92–10.02 GPa was reported. For the longitudinal and radial orientations, the elastic modulus was 7.19–8.23 and 4.01–4.27 GPa respectively. The transverse direction was overall found to be the stronger orientation with higher mechanical properties. The ultimate tensile strength of 262.96–274.38 MPa in the transverse direction was statistically significant when compared to the longitudinal and radial directions&#x27; values of 46.91–48.55 and 41.75–43.67 MPa. 

Tensile testing of antler bones has also been conducted to compare to bovine femur results. The antler samples were tested in dry and wet conditions as done in other studies. The wetness of a sample resulted in a difference in mean maximum strain: 1.46% and 2.2%, dry and wet respectively. Further, the ultimate tensile strength of wet, dry and bovine difference showed differences as well: 188 MPa, 108 MPa, and 99.2 MPa for dry, wet and bovine samples respectively. Similarly, the elastic modulus for dry samples was 17.1 GPa, 7.5 GPa for wet samples, and 17.7 GPa for bovine femur. This difference in elastic modulus is due to the difference in function of a bovine femur versus an antler. Bovine femurs must withstand greater stresses, holding up the body of the animal, whereas an antler is used for sexual selection and competition.

==Function==
=== Sexual selection ===
The principal means of evolution of antlers is sexual selection, which operates via two mechanisms: male-to-male competition (behaviorally, physiologically) and female mate choice. Male-male competition can take place in two forms. First, they can compete behaviorally where males use their antlers as weapons to compete for access to mates; second, they can compete physiologically where males present their antlers to display their strength and fertility competitiveness to compete for access to mates. Males with the largest antlers are more likely to obtain mates and achieve the highest fertilization success due to their competitiveness, dominance and high phenotypic quality. Whether this is a result of male-male fighting or display, or of female choosiness differs depending on the species as the shape, size, and function of antlers vary between species.

=== Heritability and reproductive advantage ===
There is evidence to support that antler size influences mate selection in the red deer, and has a heritable component. Despite this, a 30-year study showed no shift in the median size of antlers in a population of red deer. The lack of response could be explained by environmental covariance, meaning that lifetime breeding success is determined by an unmeasured trait which is phenotypically correlated with antler size but for which there is no genetic correlation of antler growth. Alternatively, the lack of response could be explained by the relationship between heterozygosity and antler size, which states that males heterozygous at multiple loci, including MHC loci, have larger antlers. The evolutionary response of traits that depend on heterozygosity is slower than traits that are dependent on additive genetic components and thus the evolutionary change is slower than expected. A third possibility is that the costs of having larger antlers (resource use, and mobility detriments, for instance) exert enough selective pressure to offset the benefit of attracting mates; thereby stabilizing antler size in the population.

===Protection against predation===

If antlers functioned only in male–male competition for mates, the best evolutionary strategy would be to shed them immediately after the rutting season, both to free the male from a heavy encumbrance and to give him more time to regrow a larger new pair. Yet antlers are commonly retained through the winter and into the spring, suggesting that they have another use. Wolves in Yellowstone National Park are 3.6 times more likely to attack individual male elk without antlers, or groups of elk in which at least one male is without antlers. Half of all male elk killed by wolves lack antlers, at times in which only one quarter of all males have shed antlers. These findings suggest that antlers have a secondary function in deterring predation.

=== Female antlers in reindeer ===

Reindeer (&quot;Rangifer tarandus)&quot; are the only cervid species that inhabit the Arctic and subarctic regions of the globe, yet their most striking distinction is the presence of pedicles after birth and antlers in both males and females. One possible reason that females of this species evolved antlers is to clear away snow so they can eat the vegetation underneath. Another possible reason is for female competition during winter foraging. Espmark (1964) observed that the presence of antlers on females is related to the hierarchy rank and is a result of the harsh winter conditions and the female dominated parental investment. Males shed their antlers prior to winter, while female antlers are retained throughout winter. Also, female antler size plateaus at the onset of puberty, around age three, while males&#x27; antler size increases during their lifetime. This likely reflects the differing life history strategies of the two sexes, where females are resource limited in their reproduction and cannot afford costly antlers, while male reproductive success depends on the size of their antlers because they are under directional sexual selection. In other species of deer, the presence of antlers in females indicates some degree of intersex condition, the frequency of which has been seen to vary from 1.5% to 0.02%.

=== Antenna for hearing===

In moose, antlers may act as large hearing aids. Equipped with large, highly adjustable external ears, moose have highly sensitive hearing. Moose with antlers have more sensitive hearing than moose without, and a study of trophy antlers with an artificial ear confirmed that the large flattened (palmate) antler behaves like a parabolic reflector.

== Diversification ==
The diversification of antlers, body size and tusks has been strongly influenced by changes in habitat and behavior (fighting and mating).

=== Capreolinae ===
=== Cervinae ===
== Homology and evolution of tines ==

Antlers originated once in the cervid lineage. The earliest fossil remains of antlers that have been found are dated to the early Miocene, about 17 million years ago. These early antlers were small and had just two forks. As antlers evolved, they lengthened and gained many branches, or tines, becoming more complex. The homology of tines has been discussed since the 1900s and has provided great insight into the evolutionary history of the Cervidae family.

Recently, a new method to describe the branching structure of antlers was developed. It is by using antler grooves, which are formed on the surface of antlers by growth, projecting the branching structure on the burr circumference, and making diagrams. Comparing the positional order among species on the diagram, the tine on the same position is homologous. The study revealed that three-pointed structures of Capreolinae and Cervini are homoplasious, and their subclades gained synapomorphous tines.

== Exploitation by other species ==

=== Ecological role ===
Discarded antlers represent a source of calcium, phosphorus and other minerals and are often gnawed upon by small animals, including squirrels, porcupines, rabbits and mice. This is more common among animals inhabiting regions where the soil is deficient in these minerals. Antlers shed in oak forest inhabited by squirrels are rapidly chewed to pieces by them.

=== Trophy hunting ===
Antlered heads are prized as trophies with larger sets being more highly prized. The first organization to keep records of sizes was Rowland Ward Ltd., a London taxidermy firm, in the early 20th century. For a time only total length or spread was recorded. In the middle of the century, the Boone and Crockett Club and the Safari Club International developed complex scoring systems based on various dimensions and the number of tines or points, and they keep extensive records of high-scoring antlers. Deer bred for hunting on farms are selected based on the size of the antlers.

Hunters have developed terms for antler parts: beam, palm, brow, bez or bay, trez or tray, royal, and surroyal. These are the main shaft, flattened center, first tine, second tine, third tine, fourth tine, and fifth or higher tines, respectively. The second branch is also called an advancer.

In Yorkshire in the United Kingdom roe deer hunting is especially popular due to the large antlers produced there. This is due to the high levels of chalk in Yorkshire. The chalk is high in calcium which is ingested by the deer and helps growth in the antlers.

===Shed antler hunting===
Gathering shed antlers or &quot;sheds&quot; attracts dedicated practitioners who refer to it colloquially as &quot;shed hunting&quot;, or &quot;bone picking&quot;. In the United States, the middle of December to the middle of February is considered shed hunting season, when deer, elk, and moose begin to shed. The North American Shed Hunting Club, founded in 1991, is an organization for those who take part in this activity.

In the United States in 2017 sheds fetch around US$10 per pound, with larger specimens in good condition attracting higher prices. The most desirable antlers have been found soon after being shed. The value is reduced if they have been damaged by weathering or being gnawed by small animals. A matched pair from the same animal is a very desirable find but often antlers are shed separately and may be separated by several miles. Some enthusiasts for shed hunting use trained dogs to assist them. Most hunters will follow &#x27;game trails&#x27; (trails where deer frequently run) to find these sheds or they will build a shed trap to collect the loose antlers in the late winter/early spring.

In most US states, the possession of or trade in parts of game animals is subject to some degree of regulation, but the trade in antlers is widely permitted. In the national parks of Canada, the removal of shed antlers is an offense punishable by a maximum fine of C$25,000, as the Canadian government considers antlers to belong to the people of Canada and part of the ecosystems in which they are discarded.

=== Carving for decorative and tool uses ===
Antler has been used through history as a material to make tools, weapons, ornaments, and toys. It was an especially important material in the European Late Paleolithic, used by the Magdalenian culture to make carvings and engraved designs on objects such as the so-called Bâton de commandements and the &quot;Bison Licking Insect Bite&quot;. In the Viking Age and medieval period, it formed an important raw material in the craft of comb-making. In later periods, antler—used as a cheap substitute for ivory—was a material especially associated with equipment for hunting, such as saddles and horse harness, guns and daggers, powder flasks, as well as buttons and the like. The decorative display of wall-mounted pairs of antlers has been popular since medieval times at least.

The Netsilik, an Inuit group, made bows and arrows using antler, reinforced with strands of animal tendons braided to form a cable-backed bow. Several Indigenous American tribes also used antler to make bows, gluing tendons to the bow instead of tying them as cables. An antler bow, made in the early 19th century, is on display at Brooklyn Museum. Its manufacture is attributed to the Yankton Sioux.

Through history large deer antler from a suitable species (e.g. red deer) were often cut down to its shaft and its lowest tine and used as a one-pointed pickax.

=== Ceremonial roles ===
Antler headdresses were worn by shamans and other spiritual figures in various cultures, and for dances; 21 antler &quot;frontlets&quot; apparently for wearing on the head, and over 10,000 years old, have been excavated at the English Mesolithic site of Starr Carr. Antlers are still worn in traditional dances such as Yaqui deer dances and carried in the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance.

=== Dietary usage ===
In the velvet antler stage, antlers of elk and deer have been used in Asia as a dietary supplement or alternative medicinal substance for more than 2,000 years. Recently, deer antler extract has become popular among Western athletes and body builders because the extract, with its trace amounts of IGF-1, is believed to help build and repair muscle tissue; however, one double-blind study did not find evidence of intended effects.

Elk, deer, and moose antlers have also become popular forms of dog chews that owners purchase for their pet canines.

=== Shed hunting with dogs ===
Dogs are sometimes used to find shed antlers. The North American Shed Hunting Dog Association (NASHDA) has resources for people who want to train their dogs to find shed antlers and hold shed dog hunting events.

<doc id="57515" wikidata="Q205353" url="?curid=57515" title="James M. Buchanan">
<text>James McGill Buchanan Jr. ( ; October 3, 1919 – January 9, 2013) was an American economist known for his work on public choice theory originally outlined in his most famous work, &quot;The Calculus of Consent&quot;, co-authored with Gordon Tullock in 1962. He continued to develop the theory, eventually receiving the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1986. Buchanan&#x27;s work initiated research on how politicians&#x27; and bureaucrats&#x27; self-interest, utility maximization, and other non-wealth-maximizing considerations affect their decision-making. He was a member of the Board of Advisors of The Independent Institute as well as of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a member of the Mont Pelerin Society (MPS) and MPS president from 1984 to 1986, a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the Cato Institute, and professor at George Mason University.

==Early life and education==
Buchanan was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the eldest of the three children of James and Lila (Scott) Buchanan. His paternal grandfather, John P. Buchanan, was governor of Tennessee from 1891 to 1893. According to Buchanan&#x27;s 1992 memoir, when his father, James Buchanan, Sr., married in 1918 and began his family he borrowed heavily to mechanize and improve the farm, including the acquisition of a herd of Jersey cattle. The Buchanan farm suffered during the 1920sby the time James Buchanan, Jr. was old enough to work on the farm, all the work was done either manually or with mules and horses. Buchanan described his life on the farm as &quot;genteel poverty&quot; with neither indoor plumbing nor electricity. The house did contain his grandfather&#x27;s library of books on politics. Unlike in other farm families where children regularly stayed home to help as farm labor, his mother insisted he never miss a day of school. While completing his first university degree in 1940 at Middle Tennessee State Teachers College he continued to live at home and work on the farm. In 1941 he completed his M.S. at the University of Tennessee.

==World War II==
Buchanan attended the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen&#x27;s School in New York starting in September 1941. He was assigned to Honolulu, Hawaii in March 1942, where he served as an officer on Admiral Chester W. Nimitz&#x27;s operations planning staff in the United States Navy.

Buchanan attributed his dislike of what he considered &quot;Eastern elites&quot; to his six months of Navy officer training in New York in 1941. He believed that there was overt discrimination against young men from the South or West in favor of those who had attended what he called establishment universities in the Northeast. In a 2011 interview, Buchanan said that out of twenty &quot;boys from the establishment universities, 12 or 13 were picked against a background of a total of 600 [men].&quot; He was completing his last month of training in New York during the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Buchanan said that &quot;in balance&quot; his work in operations planning during the war was &quot;easy.&quot; He was discharged in November 1945.

==Education==

With the support of his wife, Ann Bakke, and the generous G.I. Bill education subsidy available to war veterans, Buchanan applied to graduate school. In his 1992 autobiography, Buchanan said that when he began his graduate studies in 1945 at the University of Chicago, he was unaware of how market-oriented the Chicago school of economics was. He stated that he was essentially socialist until he enrolled in a course taught by Frank Knight. Knight, who also taught leading economic thinkers such as Milton Friedman and George Stigler at the University of Chicago, was a founding member of the Mont Pelerin Society. Within six weeks of starting his studies, Buchanan said he was &quot;converted into a zealous advocate of the market order&quot;. Knight became Buchanan&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; PhD supervisor, and his 1948 dissertation, &quot;Fiscal Equity in a Federal State&quot;, was heavily influenced by Knight. Buchanan did not consider himself as belonging to the Austrian or the Chicago schools of economics. But he was a member of the Mont Pelerin Society, and served as its president from 1984 to 1986 just before he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He did share many of their common beliefs. As Buchanan puts it: &quot;I certainly have a great deal of affinity with Austrian economics and I have no objections to being called an Austrian. Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises might consider me an Austrian but, surely some of the others would not.&quot; Buchanan went on to say that: &quot;I didn&#x27;t become acquainted with Mises until I wrote an article on individual choice and voting in the market in 1954. After I had finished the first draft I went back to see what Mises had said in &quot;Human Action&quot;. I found out, amazingly, that he had come closer to saying what I was trying to say than anybody else.&quot;

It was also at Chicago that he first read and found enlightening the work of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Photographs of Knight and Wicksell hung on his office walls ever after.

==Academic career==
After completing his PhD in 1948, Buchanan taught at the University of Tennessee as associate professor and later full professor from 1948 until 1951. He was a professor of economics at Florida State University from 1951 until 1956 and served for two years as the department chair. From 1955 to 1956 he was a Fulbright Scholar in Italy.

He taught at the University of Virginia from 1956 to 1968, UCLA from 1968 to 1969, and Virginia Tech from 1969 to 1983, where he held the title Distinguished Professor of Economics. In 1998, Buchanan returned to Virginia Tech as a Distinguished Emeritus Professor of Economics and Philosophy where he contributed in organizing and providing funds for workshops, symposium, and lectures, including the annual James M. Buchanan lectures.

In 1983 he became a professor at George Mason University where he remained until his retirement, after which he continued with emeritus status.

==Professional organizations==
===Thomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy===
In 1956 Buchanan and G. Warren Nutter approached the president of the University of Virginia to discuss the creation of a new school within the university, &quot;The Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy and Social Philosophy&quot;. Nutter, who studied under Friedman and Knight at the University of Chicago in the late 1940s, was working at that time under the sponsorship of the Brookings Institution&#x27;s National Bureau of Economic Research (INBR) on his 1962 book &quot;The Growth of Industrial Production in the Soviet Union&quot;. It was Thomas Jefferson who founded the University of Virginia in 1819 in Charlottesville, Virginia as a public research university. The next year the school was founded with the intention of preserving a &quot;social order built on individual liberty, and . . . as an educational undertaking in which students will be encouraged to view the organizational problems of society as a fusion of technical and philosophical issues.&quot;

One of the Center&#x27;s early publications that reached a wider audience was a 1959 report Buchanan co-authored with Nutter, &quot;The Economics of Universal Education&quot;. In it they wrote that the, &quot;case for universal education is self-evident: a democracy cannot function without an informed and educated citizenry. . . . If education is to be universal, compulsion must be exercised by government—that is, by the collective organ of society—since some parents might choose to keep their children out of school. For similar reasons, minimum standards of education must be determined by government. Otherwise, the requirement of education is empty and meaningless.&quot; Buchanan was not against &quot;state participation in education&quot; although he strongly opposed &quot; state monopoly of education&quot;.

Its publication provided the Center and its authors, their first opportunity to be involved in a major public policy issue related to constitutional reform. A March 12, 1959 &quot;Charlottesville Daily Progress&quot; editorial called for reform of Virginia&#x27;s constitution that would recognize &quot;both the need for universal education and the right of the individual to freedom of choice in the education of his children.&quot; Georgetown University historian, James H. Hershman, said the wording seems to be from &quot;The Economics of Universal Education&quot;. In a 2017 CATO Institute&#x27;s Libertarianism.org podcast, Richard E. Wagner, who studied under Buchanan in the 1960s and maintained a 50-year friendship with him, said that Buchanan was an &quot;egalitarian&quot; and had no objection to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education U.S. Supreme Court decision that introduced desegregation in public schools. Wagner said that while Buchanan opposed segregated schools at the time, he also believed in decentralization and parental and student choice within a liberal orientation of people being able to develop their talents and abilities. Hershman wrote the &quot;Encyclopedia Virginia&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Massive Resistance&quot; article,&#x27; and his 1978 PhD dissertation was on the massive resistance strategya Virginia state government strategy adopted in 1956 to block the desegregation of public schools led by Harry F. Byrd Sr., who coined the term. In a 2020 article, Hershman examined Buchanan&#x27;s actions in the spring of 1959 within the context of the massive resistance policy. By the time Buchanan became involved, there was already a groundswell of protests against desegregation based on constitutional arguments, states&#x27; rights, and even some arguments from the Chicago school of economics. The Virginia school crisis offered Buchanan a &quot;major opportunity&quot; of promoting &quot;libertarian economic and social ideas.&quot; The Buchanan and Nutter report proved most useful just before an April 16, 1959, public hearing on a proposed constitutional change. In order to counter the argument that a &quot;private system was unfeasible and that any weakening of public education would damage the state&#x27;s economy overall and discourage new industries from coming to Virginia&quot;, supporters asked Buchanan and Nutter to write a shorter summary of their February report. They published two articles on the report in the Richmond &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; on April 12 and 13. While Buchanan&#x27;s personal views on race were beside the point, according to Hershman, the &quot;massive resistance private school initiative&quot; had provided an &quot;opportunity to &quot;create a functioning alternative to the existing public system&quot;, to &quot;promote his libertarian education doctrines, as an example to showcase those ideas&quot;. Hershman wrote that it did not seem to concern Buchanan that the libertarian doctrines would perpetuate segregation. Buchanan was on the wrong side of history. The school crisis brought in a power shift in the state of Virginia from a &quot;rural, courthouse elite to that of an urban, business elite&quot;.

In later years, Buchanan no longer held the same ideas on school vouchers as those expressed in the 1959 report. He cautioned in a 1984 letter to the Institute for Economic Affairs&#x27; Arthur Seldon that a state-sponsored unregulated voucher system from tax revenues to avoid the &quot;evils of state monopoly&quot; of the education system, could have the unintended consequence of the &quot;evils of race-class-cultural segregation.&quot; The voucher system could result in recreating the exclusive membership-only system for elites. While vouchers would ideally promote market competition while also providing benefits of &quot;exposure to other races, classes and cultures&quot;, Buchanan warned that this may not happen in practice.

==== Public Choice Society and &quot;Public Choice&quot; journal ====
With the publication of &quot;The Calculus of Consent&quot; in 1962 and Mancur Olson&#x27;s &quot;Logic of Collective Action&quot; in 1965, there was growing interest in public choice theory. Tullock and Buchanan applied for and received a National Science Foundation grant to organize a preliminary research meeting in Charlottesville in 1963 with about twenty people from economics, philosophy, and political science including Olson, William H. Riker, Vincent Ostrom, Anthony Downs, Duncan Black, Roland McKean, Jerome Rothenberg, and John Rawls (author of the influential 1971 &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;). They created a Committee for the Study of Non-Market Decision Making, which later became the Public Choice Society. They wanted to focus on how choices and &quot;decisions were made outside of a private market context&quot;. As a follow-up, they launched a journal with Tullock as editor called &quot;Papers on Non-market Decision Making&quot;. Tullock remained as editor until 1990. They had several follow-up meetings, including one in Chicago in 1967. Members were dissatisfied with the title and it was changed to &quot;Public Choice&quot;.

==== Virginia school of political economy ====

Buchanan remained at the University of Virginia until 1968. The work of Buchanan, Nutter, and other colleagues including Tullock, Stigler, Ronald Coase, Alexandre Kafka, and Leland B. Yeager later came to be seen as the start of the Virginia school of political economy as separate from the Chicago school of economics. Buchanan stated that Mancur Olson came up with the term some time after the Center for Study of Public Choice was founded at Virginia Tech. In a 1997 interview with &quot;Reason&quot;, Coase discussed the atmosphere in the university&#x27;s economics department in the 1960s, in which he and Buchanan, Tullock, and Nutter felt that their work was considered to be &quot;disreputable&quot; and they were considered to be &quot;right-wing extremists.&quot; Coase stated that he believed there was general suspicion towards anyone who supported an unregulated free market at that time.

===Center for Study of Public Choice===
In 1969, Buchanan, Tullock, and Charles J. Goetz established the Center for Study of Public Choice at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) in Blacksburg, Virginia with Buchanan as its first director.

In 1983, Buchanan relocated the entire Center for Study of Public Choice unit, which included its seven faculty members to George Mason University (GMU) in Fairfax, Virginia. Buchanan complained to then-GMU economics department chair Karen Vaughn that VPI was losing its status as unique center for public choice. Buchanan was offered an annual salary of over $100,000 at George Mason, At the time, George Mason was a relatively unknown state university, having just gained independent status from the University of Virginia in 1972. Buchanan was drawn to GMU&#x27;s leadership. Vaughn stated that she believed the addition of the Center contributed to GMU&#x27;s rapid growth. Over the next decades, GMU became the largest public university in Virginia.

Economist James C. Miller III, who served as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and as Budget Director for then-US president Ronald Reagan consulted with Buchanan, Tullock, and Tollison at the Center. From 1998 to 2002 the Center functioned as part of James M. Buchanan Center for Political Economy. 

===Other activities and associations===
Buchanan was president of the Southern Economic Association in 1963 and of the Western Economic Association in 1983 and 1984, and vice president of the American Economic Association in 1971.

Buchanan was associated with the Indianapolis-headquartered Liberty Fund, a free-market think tank which was founded in 1960 by Pierre F. Goodrich. Goodrich became a member of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1953 and had formed friendships with Hayek, Mises, Friedman and others. The Liberty Fund hosted conferences and symposiums on Buchanan&#x27;s economic policy, liberalism and liberty. The entire collection of his publications are hosted on the Online Library of Liberty (OLL) site. The Liberty Fund also published &quot;The Collected Works of James Buchanan&quot;.

==Major research themes==

Buchanan broad themes include public finance then public goods, public choice, and public philosophy. In the late 1940s and 1950s he investigated voting and other topics not usually studied in economics. Buchanan began to break from &quot;disciplinary constraints&quot; and examine problems from other disciplines such as political science.

In 1948, Buchanan first read the Swedish economist, Wicksell&#x27;s &quot;Finanztheoretische Untersuchungen&quot; 1896 essay, &quot;A New Principle of Just Taxation.&quot; He translated it from German and in his 1986 Nobel Prize lecture Buchanan said that Wicksell was an &quot;important precursor of modern public-choice theory.&quot;had informed his own concept of unanimity-voting. Wicksell investigated a mechanism for voting how public goods could be financed in order to ensure that the tax burden was fairly distributed. Wicksell applied the benefit principle to taxation. By using the mechanism of unanimity-voting, everyone involved would have a guarantee of receiving &quot;benefits commensurate to their tax cost from any public good&quot;. Wicksell said that no would be able to complain if he were able to receive &quot;a benefit which he himself considers to be (greater or at least) as great as the price he has to pay&quot;.

Buchanan said that his 1949 paper, &quot;The Pure Theory of Government Finance: A Suggested Approach&quot; published in the Journal of Political Economy he was influenced by Wicksell. to improve the rules and structure of politics, and particularly to recognize that politicians behave like most people, according to their own self-interests. It was a way of thinking about politics that was based on common sense reality, not romanticism. In that paper he called on economists to clarify their own assumptions about politics and to think about their political models before talking about &quot;good taxation&quot; and &quot;good spending.&quot; &quot;The Pure Theory of Government Finance: A Suggested Approach&quot; published in the Journal of Political Economy It contained core ideas that Buchanan continued to develop over his career which spanned six decades, according to his biographer Richard E. Wagner. In his 1989 address on Buchanan&#x27;s contributions, Tony Atkinson said that it &quot;reads like a manifesto for his life&#x27;s work.&quot; In it Buchanan clarified that the democratic state is not a single decision-making unit as in a monarchy. In democratic societies, the state can only represent the collective will of the sum of its individual members.

His 1950 article, &quot;Federalism and Fiscal Equity&quot;reprinted in Richard A. Musgrave 1959 &quot;Readings in the economics of taxation&quot;was described as a &quot;pioneering&quot; paper by Musgrave. During the recession of 1960–1961, Buchanan and Musgrave served on a Brookings Institution&#x27;s National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) advisory committee on the needs, sources, and utilization of public finances. Brookings is a respected think tank that has a long history of producing influential commissioned reports for the United States government. In their discussion on equity objectives of fiscal policy, Musgrave cited Buchanan&#x27;s recommendation that the central fiscal policy should consider individuals, not the &quot;states&quot;, as a matter of equity. The requirement of horizontal equitythe &quot;principle that equals should be treated equally&quot; is more meaningful than that of vertical equitythe &quot;requirement of differential treatment of unequals&quot;.

In 1955 Buchanan spent the year in Italy reading the works of the neoclassical economist Maffeo Pantaleoni (1857 –1924) and his followersAntonio De Viti De Marco and Vilfredo Pareto, who are part of the Italian school of public finance theory. They are considered to be a major influence on Buchanan&#x27;s work. He considered them to be among the &quot;intellectual forefathers of the modern public choice theory&quot;. In his &quot;Public Principles of Public Debt&quot; published in 1958, Buchanan acknowledged that &quot;the Italian approach to the whole problem of public debt was instrumental in shaping my views&quot;. rigorous analysis of the theory of logrolling, macroeconomics, constitutional economics, and libertarian theory. He was the first anglophone economist to focus on this and included their work in his chapter, &quot;The Italian Tradition in Fiscal Theory&quot;, in his 1960 textbook &quot;Fiscal Theory and Political Economy&quot;. He discussed collective decision-making in public financethe role of the government in the state&#x27;s economy and fiscal theory.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s as Buchanan was developing his own thoughts on the concept of the state, Kenneth Arrow published his influential 1951 monograph, &quot;Social Choice and Individual Values&quot;. which was the catalyst for debate on social choice. The monograph was based on ideas Arrow first developed in 1948 as a RAND Corporation intern and in his PhD dissertation in 1950 combining social ethics, voting theory and economics in his social choice theory. Arrow examined the role of individual preferences in the process of collective decision-making regarding aggregate or group preferences, for example, in voting and establishing underlying constitutions for the common good. Arrow concluded that it was generally impossible to assess the &quot;common good&quot;, for example, the design of a social welfare function through a fair ranked voting electoral system because individual preferences within the aggregate differ. The paradox is the impossibility of majority voting yielding a stable result or pareto efficiency with existing rules of the game. Buchanan critiqued Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem or Arrow&#x27;s paradox. The thesis in Arrow&#x27;s 1951 book that &quot;majority rule would not give you a political equilibrium&quot; created a lot of debate. Buchanan responded that his idea was anti-majoritaireif that is what the preferences are, then in a democracy we ought to have a rotation, so there is not just one majority simply ruling. Most political scientists in the 1950s believed in majoritarian democracy as the ideal parliamentary model. Buchanan&#x27;s ideal was more of a constitutional structure. Buchanan described himself as a constitutional political economist who writes from an economic point of view within a structure of American politics that aligns with James Madison&#x27;s vision of the ideal democratic parliamentary model, which was not a majority democracy. In public choice theory, Buchanan raises concerns about minorities being exploited under permanent majorities

While in Italy on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1956 - 1957 he became aware of how his generation of Americansthose born in the decades after WWIhad a view of politics that was too romanticized. Italians took a more skeptical, realistic, and critical view of politics. When he returned to the US in 1956, he carried that skepticism with him. In 1958, Tullock took time off from his position at the U.S. Department of State that he had held since 1949, to do research at the University of Virginia focused on majority rule. Buchanan described Tullock as a natural realist about politics; his skepticism had increased in Washington.

Buchanan met Tullock, who had a law degree but no formal training in economics, when Tullock accepted a postdoctoral position at the University of Virginia in 1958. Although Tullock&#x27;s PhD was in law and he had little formal training in economics, the two complemented each other; Buchanan as the philosopher and Tullock the scientist. Together, they set out to provide an &quot;optimal set of the political rules of the game&quot;.

In 1962, Buchanan and Tullock published &quot;Calculus of Consent, Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy&quot;, in which they first outlined public choice theory. Buchanan said he was motivated to write &quot;The Calculus of Consent&quot;, because he had a sense that those who should know what democracy actually was, did not. He started to question taxation, expenditure decisions, budgets and the political process. In the same year Buchanan began drafts of his 1967 book, &quot;Public Finance in Democratic Process: Fiscal Institutions and the Individual Choice&quot; in which he applied ideas from pioneering ideas from the public choice school of analysis developed in &quot;Calculus of Consent&quot; to public finance. Buchanan received research support and assistance from the Brookings Institution for the book. In it he analyzed how individual behavior affected fiscal institutions in situations related to collective choice, for example, the relationship between income tax and the public use of economic resources. He said that the primary way in which individuals can make collective choices is by voting.

In 1967 Buchanan co-authored &quot;Public Debt in a Democratic Society&quot; with Wagner. Buchanan considered his work on public debt as an important extension of his work on public choice theory. Public choice theory examined political decision-making structures as applied to budget policy, specifically as related to fiscal deficit. Buchanan said that there was government overreach in totalitarian regimes but also in the 1960s in Western democratic welfare-state nations, such as President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Great Society&quot; programs designed to eliminate poverty and racial injustice. As more people became critical of government programs during the 1970s, in his view public choice theory provided some common sense answers, as opposed to romance. He said that he did not want to &quot;lead the way&quot;, he wanted to provide a way for people to &quot;interpret better what they were seeing&quot;. He described how politicians provide their constituents with programs that benefit them, paying for the new programs with deficit to avoid having to raise taxes to pay for them in order to remain in office. Public choice policies called for constitutional amendments to prevent the deficit from accelerating even more. In his 1986 chapter &quot;Budgetary Bias in Post-Keynesian Politics&quot; in &quot;Deficits&quot;, he wrote, &quot;The most elementary prediction from public choice theory is that in the absence of moral or constitutional constraints democracies will finance some share of public consumption from debt issue rather than from taxation and that, in consequence, spending rates will be higher than would accrue under budget balance.&quot;

In 1968, Buchanan left the University of Virginia and spent a year at the University of California, Los Angeles. He published &quot;The Demand and Supply of Public Goods&quot;, in which he described public finance methods using consensus politics developed by Wicksell and his student Erik Lindahl (1891 – 1960) within the framework of their concept of the ideal state. Hayek had introduced their work to anglophone economists in his 1941 &quot;Pure Theory of Capital&quot; written while he was at the London School of Economics (LSE). Buchanan traced the history of public goods theory to Wicksell and re-examined the Wicksellian unanimous solution in voting. He discussed tax shares as a variable in public finance theory and potential outcomes of public choice by majority rule. The Lindahl tax share on public goods paid by individuals is based on the marginal benefits derived from the goodsa system designed to maximize efficiency for the individual while also providing optimal public good. The rate or share of taxation is related to the willingness to pay. Buchanan discussed challenges to achieving a Pareto-optimal position from Lindahl&#x27;s concept of public goods, such as free riders.

Buchanan&#x27;s 1969 work &quot;Cost and Choice&quot; is often overlooked for its contributions in defining the parameters of opportunity cost. In it, he writes that the costs to individuals determine what the price of a good or service is. For example, the physical work that is required to hunt an animal as well as the price of the tools necessary to hunt it and the time spent hunting all play a factor in the price an individual places on the meat. The asking price of the meat will vary from person to person because the input costs required for each person are not the same.

In his 1964 article &quot;What Should Economists Do?&quot;, which was based on his 1963 address to the Southern Economic Association (SEA), Buchanan distinguished between economics and politics. The former studies &quot;the whole system of exchange relationships&quot; while the latter studies &quot;the whole system of coercive or potentially coercive relationships&quot;. One of Buchanan&#x27;s definitive statements on the re-orientation of the two academic disciplines of economics and political science was found in this 1963 SEA address.
Buchanan told his contemporaries in the field of economics that Adam Smith&#x27;s statement in his 1776 &quot;An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&quot; that the human &quot;propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another&quot; is what political economy is all about. Economists should therefore focus on the politics of exchange not on attempting to engineer efficient allocations of resources.

Michael Munger described three elements of Buchanan&#x27;s concept of public choice theorybehavioural symmetry, methodological individualism, and politics as exchange, or &quot;politics without romance&quot;. In their article on Buchanan&#x27;s politics as exchange, they described him as a classical liberal, who also incorporated rational choice theory, and individual utility maximization in his analyses. The ultimate exchange process is not based on some romantic notion of public service that Buchanan roundly rejected. &quot;Politics of exchange implies a shared exchange relationship or enterprise that is crucial as a way of &quot;justifying political coercion of one person over another&quot;. Buchanan encouraged individuals to be skeptical about bureaucrats&#x27; and politicians&#x27; motivations and behaviour. Buchanan said that the &quot;politics as exchange&quot; contract on which the constitution is based precedes any economic enterprise. Trade in goods and services can only be undertaken in an orderly fashion if a legal system in already in place, one that includes limits on the powers of governments. Politics of exchange can then be described as cooperative, the contract between &quot;nonmarket institutions and the mechanism of coercion is collective&quot;. Politics as exchange is a way of justifying coercion by providing a means for a change that is mutually beneficial, attaining pareto efficiency through cooperation, where societal improvement is possible when a change results in harming no one but helping someone.

In his 1966 publication &quot;Public Finance in a Democratic Process&quot; Buchanan began to develop applications based on &quot;The Calculus of Consent&quot; using a multidisciplinary approach through the lens of both economics and politics .

Buchanan was largely responsible for the rebirth of political economy as a scholarly pursuit. He emphasized that public policy cannot be considered solely in terms of distribution, but is instead always a matter of setting the rules of the game that engender a pattern of exchange and distribution. His work in public choice theory is often interpreted as the quintessential instance of economics imperialism; however, Amartya Sen has argued that Buchanan should not be identified with economics imperialism, since he has done more than most to introduce ethics, legal political thinking, and indeed social thinking into economics. Crucial to understanding Buchanan&#x27;s system of thought is the distinction he made between politics and policy. Politics is about the rules of the game, where policy is focused on strategies that players adopt within a given set of rules. &quot;Questions about what are good rules of the game are in the domain of social philosophy, whereas questions about the strategies that players will adopt given those rules is the domain of economics, and it is the play between the rules (social philosophy) and the strategies (economics) that constitutes what Buchanan refers to as constitutional political economy&quot;.

In his 1975 book, &quot;The Limits of Liberty: Between Anarchy and Leviathan&quot;, which has been described as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, Buchanan examined the concept of a social contract. In &quot;The Limits of Liberty&quot; Buchanan did support some redistribution; his proposed social contract of a &quot;productive&quot; state includes tax-financed goods and some social insurance. He felt this would have unanimous agreement. In the summer of 1975 at a Liberty Fund conference in Ohio with most of the economists in attendance saying there should be no estate tax, Buchanan passionately disagreed. He thought that there should be a 100% marginal tax on all estates over a relatively modest amount, to prevent an aristocracy from forming in America and to ensure equal opportunity.

Buchanan was a vocal critic of the 1994 David Card and Alan B. Krueger&#x27;s minimum wage study. Contrary to the consensus at the time, they found that &quot;the increase in the minimum wage increased employment.&quot; In a 1996 response in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, Buchanan wrote, &quot;Just as no physicist would claim that &quot;water runs uphill,&quot; no self-respecting economist would claim that increases in the minimum wage increase employment. [...] Fortunately, only a handful of economists are willing to throw over the teaching of two centuries; we have not yet become a bevy of camp-following whores.&quot;

===Public choice theory===
Buchanan is the chief architect and the leading researcher of public choice theory which was first outlined in his most well-known work, &quot;The Calculus of Consent&quot;. Over many decades, Buchanan developed the theoretical formulation which straddled both economics and political science and became known as &quot;The New Political Economy&quot; or &quot;Public Choice&quot; for which he was honored with the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Sir Anthony (Tony) Atkinson said that one of Buchanan&#x27;s major contributions was clarifying two levels of public choicethe constitutional level which is where the rules of the game are set, and the postconstitutional level, where the game is played within the constitutional rules.

In &quot;The Calculus of Consent&quot;, Buchanan and Tullock cited Swedish economist Knut Wicksell&#x27;s standpoint on public choice in their argument for the need for unanimous agreement on constitutional rules. Anthony Atkinson cited the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences describing the significant role of Wicksell in the development of Buchanan&#x27;s thinking. It was Buchanan who translated Wicksell&#x27;s &quot;A New Principle of Just Taxation&quot; from German in 1958. Within the framework of public choice, they described the potential for logrolling as enhancing rather than reducing welfare. Logrolling refers to politicians&#x27; vote-trading on provisions as part of an endgame of achieving their political or economic goals.

According to a 1992 journal article by George Mason University economists, Alexander Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen, the precursor to Buchanan and Tullock&#x27;s public choice theory is found in the work of John C. Calhoun. Tabarrok, who is the director of the Center for Study of Public Choice, and Cowen, Director of the Mercatus Center and a CSPC faculty member, said that Calhoun&#x27;s political philosophy writings, as developed in his 1851 &quot;A Disquisition on Government&quot;, proposed the rule by unanimity to reform the constitution, which as it then existed according to Calhoun, had resulted in a form of democracy that did not sufficiently protect liberty. In his analysis of Calhoun&#x27;s work through the Virginia political economy perspective, the Heartland Institute&#x27;s Alexander Salter wrote that Buchanan&#x27;s project regarding generality norm is supported by Calhoun&#x27;s concurrent majority developed in the &quot;Disquisition&quot;.

In the &quot;Dictionary of Economics,&quot; Tullock said that public choice theory applies methodologies from economics to the study of political behavior. Public choice theory assumes that people are mainly guided by self-interest, including politicians, bureaucrats, and government officials. Public choice theory focuses on democratic decision-making process within the political realm. Buchanan used both fields of economics and political science to help develop his theory of public choice. The same principles used to interpret people&#x27;s decisions in a market setting are applied to voting, lobbying, , and even candidates. Buchanan maintains that a person&#x27;s first instinct is to make their decisions based upon their own self-interest, which varied from previous models where government officials acted in constituents&#x27; best interest. Buchanan explains public choice theory as &quot;politics without romance&quot; because, he says, many of the promises made in politics are intended to appear concerned with the interest of others, but in reality, are the products of selfish ulterior motives. According to this view, political decisions, on both sides of the voting booth, are rarely made with the intention of helping anyone but the one making the decision. Buchanan argues that the actions of voters and politicians can be predicted by analyzing their behaviors.

In the 1960s when Buchanan first began to formulate his public choice theory, he was one of the few, if not the only economist, who was critical of Keynesian economics, which had become widely accepted in the United States in the 1960s and resulted in a shift in towards governance through &quot;macro-economic engineering&quot;. Keynes had written his classic and influential &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; in 1938, but there was a lag between its publication and the widespread adoption of his ideas. By 1965, &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured the phase &quot;We are all Keynesians now&quot; on its cover attributing it to Milton Friedman. Keynes promoted the use of deficit spending as a way to implement government programs in the wake of the Great Depression in the 1930s and Post-World War II. The 1977 book, &quot;Democracy in Deficit&quot;, by Buchanan and co-author Richard Wagner was based on an analysis of Keynesian macroeconomic theory and policy in which they applied the basic tools of public choice theory for the first time. They found that there was a bias towards deficit spending that could be linked to the self-interest of the political agents involved.

===Constitutionalism===
Within constitutionalism, Buchanan worked on developing the field of constitutional economics. According to Buchanan, the ethic of constitutionalism is a key for constitutional order and &quot;may be called the idealized Kantian world&quot; where the individual &quot;who is making the ordering, along with substantially all of his fellows, adopts the moral law as a general rule for behavior&quot;. Buchanan rejected &quot;any organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom to the citizens of this state&quot;. This philosophical position forms the basis of constitutional economics. Buchanan believed that every constitution is created for at least several generations of citizens. Therefore, it must be able to balance the interests of the state, society, and the individual.

There was a long history of neoliberal economists in Chile even before Augusto Pinochet 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état that deposed President Salvador Allende. Through the 1970s and 1980s the Chilean economists known as the Chicago Boys who studied at the University of Chicago under Milton Friedman had applied his economic theories in their government positions in South America, including in the military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990). The Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile of 1980 came into full force in March 1981 constitution, establishing a market-oriented model based on Chicago School and Friedman&#x27;s neoliberal ideas. In Chile, Buchanan provided policy advice and his constitutional political economy arguments to Pinochet. He also allegedly provided an &quot;analytical defense of military rule to a predominantly Chilean audience.&quot; Hayek also visited Chile and Pinochet that year.

==Legacy==

Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) Honors College&#x27;s Buchanan Fellowship program, named for Buchanan, is awarded to 20 first-year student at MTSU annually. Additionally, MTSU&#x27;s Buchanan Family Reading Room at the James E. Walker Library was funded with a gift by Buchanan&#x27;s family to honor Buchanan and the contributions of the family as a whole to the state of Tennessee.

In his 2017 publication, Richard Wagner described how Buchanan&#x27;s scholarship continues to influence law, ethics, political science, and economics in the 21st century.

Nicolás Cachanosky and Edward J. Lopez suggest that Buchanan&#x27;s research can inform work on trade restrictions and populism in the twenty-first century.

Buchanan is a central figure in the 2017 nonfiction book &quot;Democracy in Chains&quot; by Duke University professor and historian Nancy MacLean. MacLean traced Buchanan&#x27;s concept of power to the 1950s and 1960s. Buchanan had become concerned that the federal government was channeling too many resources to the public. As he witnessed the federal government increasing its power, Buchanan sought ways to protect the wealthy from being forced to support programs that seemed to him to be a move towards socialism. MacLean described how Buchanan and other libertarians seek to protect capitalism by preventing government overreach. MacLean described Buchanan&#x27;s concept of human nature as &quot;dismal&quot; and that he believed that politicians and government workers are motivated by self-interest and that government would continue to increase in scale and power unless there were constitutional limits in place. MacLean raised concerns that Buchanan and Charles Koch mutually supported one another to the detriment of democratic participation for all. Koch provided millions in funding to libertarian university programs and Buchanan provided the intellectual arguments from political economy to place limits on democracy. MacLean&#x27;s book became a catalyst for discussion online and in journals. &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Boston Review of Books&quot;, and &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot; gave the book positive reviews. Her critics include David Bernstein who wrote a series of &quot;Washington Post&quot; opinion pieces as part of the &quot;Volokh Conspiracy&quot; blog. In a 2018 &quot;Journal of Economic Literature&quot; review of MacLean&#x27;s book, Jean-Baptiste Fleury and Alain Marciano said that MacLean misunderstood public choice theory and that she had overlooked some significant aspects of Buchanan&#x27;s biography and thinking and had over-interpreted others. MacLean, who spent years studying Buchanan&#x27;s copious archives after his death, says that the influence of Buchanan&#x27;s six decades of work on modern conservatism is not well-enough appreciated or understood by liberal politicians, economists, and journalists.

==Personal life and death==
Buchanan met Ann Bakke, who was of Norwegian descent, in Hawaii while they were both serving in the military during World War II. Bakke served with the Army Air Transport Command at Hickam Field as a secretary.

They married on October 5, 1945, in San Francisco. Ann died in 2005. They had no children.

In a 1986 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; interview Buchanan said, &quot;I want a private sphere in which I am protected, where nobody can invade...I don&#x27;t feel the need to be a part of a community or a team.&quot; According to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; obituarist he was not known for his warm personality, and that even his &quot;staunchest admirers admitted that he was forbidding.&quot; Even though he had a long career at George Mason University in Fairfax, Buchanan and his wife chose to spend most of their time a four-hour drive away on their 400-acre working farm near Blacksburg. They had vegetable gardens and raised cattle.

Buchanan was an Atheist and antagonistic to religion.

Buchanan died at their farm on January 9, 2013, at age 93.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary said that the Nobel Prize-winning economist who championed public choice theory influenced a &quot;generation of conservative thinking about deficits, taxes and the size of government&quot;. The &quot;Badische Zeitung&quot; (Freiburg) called Buchanan, who showed how politicians undermine fair and simple tax systems, the &quot;founder of the new political economy&quot;.

<doc id="57520" wikidata="Q156814" url="?curid=57520" title="Yehudi Menuhin">
<text>Yehudi Menuhin, Baron Menuhin (22 April 191612 March 1999), was an American-born British violinist and conductor who spent most of his performing career in Britain. He is widely considered one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century. He played the Soil Stradivarius, considered one of the finest violins made by Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari.

== Early life and career ==
Yehudi Menuhin was born in New York City to Moshe Menuhin, a Lithuanian Jew from Gomel in modern Belarus, and Marutha, a Crimean Karaite. Through his father Moshe, he was descended from a rabbinical dynasty. Moshe and Marutha (née Sher) met in Ottoman Palestine before marrying in New York in 1914. In late 1919, the pair became American citizens and changed the family name from Mnuchin to Menuhin. Menuhin&#x27;s sisters were concert pianist and human rights activist Hephzibah, and pianist, painter and poet Yaltah.

Menuhin&#x27;s first violin instruction was at age four by Sigmund Anker (1891–1958); his parents had wanted Louis Persinger to teach him, and Persinger agreed. Menuhin took lessons for a while from Persinger at his Hyde Street studio. He made his first public solo appearance in November 1921, at a pupil&#x27;s concert. On 29 February 1924, he formally debuted at the Oakland Auditorium followed by a solo performance with the San Francisco Symphony under the direction of Alfred Hertz and a recital at the Scottish Rite Hall. His reputation preceded him to New York for his debut there on 17 March 1926, at the Manhattan Opera House. In 1923, when he was seven years old, Menuhin appeared as solo violinist with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Persinger then agreed to teach him and accompanied him on the piano for his first few solo recordings in 1928–29.

Julia Boyd records:

On 12 April 1929 it [the Semperoper] cancelled its advertised programme to make way for a performance by the twelve-year-old Yehudi Menuhin. That night he played the Bach, Beethoven and Brahms violin concertos to an ecstatic audience ... The week before, Yehudi had played in Berlin with the Philharmonic under Bruno Walter to an equally rapturous response.

A newspaper critic said of his Berlin performance: &quot;There steps a fat little blond boy on the podium, and wins at once all hearts as in an irresistibly ludicrous way, like a penguin, he alternately places one foot down, then the other. But wait: you will stop laughing when he puts his bow to the violin to play Bach&#x27;s violin concerto in E major no.2.&quot;

When the Menuhins moved to Paris, Persinger suggested Menuhin go to Persinger&#x27;s old teacher, Belgian virtuoso and pedagogue Eugène Ysaÿe. Menuhin did have one lesson with Ysaÿe, but he disliked Ysaÿe&#x27;s teaching method and his advanced age. Instead, he went to Romanian composer and violinist George Enescu, under whose tutelage he made recordings with several piano accompanists, including his sister Hephzibah. He was also a student of Adolf Busch in Basel. He stayed in the Swiss city for a bit more than a year, where he started to take lessons in German and Italian as well.

According to Henry A. Murray, Menuhin wrote:

His first concerto recording was made in 1931, Bruch&#x27;s G minor, under Sir Landon Ronald in London, the labels calling him &quot;Master Yehudi Menuhin&quot;. In 1932 he recorded Edward Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto in Bminor for His Master&#x27;s Voice in London, with the composer himself conducting; in 1934, uncut, Paganini&#x27;s D major Concerto with Emile Sauret&#x27;s cadenza in Paris under Pierre Monteux. Between 1934 and 1936, he made the first integral recording of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s sonatas and partitas for solo violin, although his Sonata No. 2, in A minor, was not released until all six were transferred to CD.

His interest in the music of Béla Bartók prompted him to commission a work from him – the Sonata for Solo Violin, which, completed in 1943 and first performed by Menuhin in New York in 1944, was the composer&#x27;s penultimate work.

== World War II musician ==
He performed for Allied soldiers during World War II and, accompanied on the piano by English composer Benjamin Britten, for the surviving inmates of a number of concentration camps in June and July 1945 after their liberation in April of the same year, most famously Bergen-Belsen. He returned to Germany in 1947 to play concerto concerts with the Berlin Philharmonic under Wilhelm Furtwängler as an act of reconciliation, the first Jewish musician to do so in the wake of the Holocaust, saying to Jewish critics that he wanted to rehabilitate Germany&#x27;s music and spirit.

== World interactions ==
Menuhin credited German philosopher Constantin Brunner with providing him with &quot;a theoretical framework within which I could fit the events and experiences of life&quot;.

He and Louis Kentner (brother-in-law of his wife, Diana) gave the first performance of William Walton&#x27;s Violin Sonata, in Zürich on 30 September 1949.

Following his role as a member of the awards jury at the 1955 Queen Elisabeth Music Competition, Menuhin secured a Rockefeller Foundation grant for the financially strapped Grand Prize winner at the event, Argentine violinist Alberto Lysy. Menuhin made Lysy his only personal student, and the two toured extensively throughout the concert halls of Europe. The young protégé later established the International Menuhin Music Academy (IMMA) in Gstaad, in his honor.

Menuhin made several recordings with the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, who had been criticized for conducting in Germany during the Nazi era. Menuhin defended Furtwängler, noting that the conductor had helped a number of Jewish musicians to flee Nazi Germany.

In 1957, he founded the Menuhin Festival Gstaad in Gstaad, Switzerland. In 1962, he established the Yehudi Menuhin School in Stoke d&#x27;Abernon, Surrey. He also established the music program at The Nueva School in Hillsborough, California, sometime around then. In 1965 he received an honorary knighthood from the British monarchy. In the same year, Australian composer Malcolm Williamson wrote a violin concerto for Menuhin. He performed the concerto many times and recorded it at its premiere at the Bath Festival in 1965. Originally known as the Bath Assembly, the festival was first directed by the impresario Ian Hunter in 1948. After the first year the city tried to run the festival itself, but in 1955 asked Hunter back. In 1959 Hunter invited Menuhin to become artistic director of the festival. Menuhin accepted, and retained the post until 1968.

Menuhin also had a long association and deep friendship with Ravi Shankar, beginning in 1952, leading to their joint performance in 1966 at the Bath Festival and the recording of their Grammy Award-winning album &quot;West Meets East&quot; (1967). During this time, he commissioned composer Alan Hovhaness to write a concerto for violin, sitar, and orchestra to be performed by himself and Shankar. The resulting work, entitled &quot;Shambala&quot; (c. 1970), with a fully composed violin part and space for improvisation from the sitarist, is the earliest known work for sitar with western symphony orchestra, predating Shankar&#x27;s own sitar concertos, but Menuhin and Shankar never recorded it.

Menuhin also worked with famous jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli in the 1970s on &quot;Jalousie&quot;, an album of 1930s classics led by duetting violins backed by the Alan Claire Trio.

In 1975, in his role as president of the International Music Council, he declared October 1 as International Music Day. The first International Music Day, organised by the International Music Council, was held that same year, in accordance with the resolution taken at the 15th IMC General Assembly in Lausanne in 1973.

In 1977, Menuhin and Ian Stoutzker founded the charity Live Music Now, the largest outreach music project in the UK. Live Music Now pays and trains professional musicians to work in the community, bringing the experience to those who rarely get an opportunity to hear or see live music performance.
At the Edinburgh Festival Menuhin premiered Priaulx Rainier&#x27;s violin concerto &quot;Due Canti e Finale&quot;, which he had commissioned Rainier to write. He also commissioned her last work, &quot;Wildlife Celebration&quot;, which he performed in aid of Gerald Durrell&#x27;s Wildlife Conservation Trust.

In 1983, Menuhin and Robert Masters founded the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists, today one of the world&#x27;s leading forums for young talent. Many of its prizewinners have gone on to become prominent violinists, including Tasmin Little, Nikolaj Znaider, Ilya Gringolts, Julia Fischer, Daishin Kashimoto and Ray Chen.

In the 1980s, Menuhin wrote and oversaw the creation of a &quot;Music Guides&quot; series of books; each covered a musical instrument, with one on the human voice. Menuhin wrote some, while others were edited by different authors.

In 1991, Menuhin was awarded the Wolf Prize by the Israeli Government. In the Israeli Knesset he gave an acceptance speech in which he criticised Israel&#x27;s continued occupation of the West Bank:
This wasteful governing by fear, by contempt for the basic dignities of life, this steady asphyxiation of a dependent people, should be the very last means to be adopted by those who themselves know too well the awful significance, the unforgettable suffering of such an existence. It is unworthy of my great people, the Jews, who have striven to abide by a code of moral rectitude for some 5,000 years, who can create and achieve a society for themselves such as we see around us but can yet deny the sharing of its great qualities and benefits to those dwelling amongst them.

== Later career ==
Menuhin regularly returned to the San Francisco Bay Area, sometimes performing with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. One of the more memorable later performances was of Edward Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto, which Menuhin had recorded with the composer in 1932.

On 22 April 1978, along with Stéphane Grappelli, Yehudi played &quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot;, taken from the &quot;Menuhin &amp; Grappelli Play Berlin, Kern, Porter and Rodgers &amp; Hart&quot; album as the interval act at the 23rd Eurovision Song Contest for TF1. The performance came direct from the studios of TF1 and not that of the venue (Palais des Congrès), where the contest was being held.

Menuhin hosted the PBS telecast of the gala opening concert of the San Francisco Symphony from Davies Symphony Hall in September 1980.

His recording contract with EMI lasted almost 70 years and is the longest in the history of the music industry. He made his first recording at age 13 in November 1929, and his last in 1999, when he was nearly 83 years old. He recorded over 300 works for EMI, both as a violinist and as a conductor. In 2009 EMI released a 51-CD retrospective of Menuhin&#x27;s recording career, titled &quot;Yehudi Menuhin: The Great EMI Recordings&quot;. In 2016, the Menuhin centenary year, Warner Classics (formerly EMI Classics) issued a milestone collection of 80 CDs entitled &quot;The Menuhin Century&quot;, curated by his long-time friend and protégé Bruno Monsaingeon, who selected the recordings and sourced rare archival materials to tell Menuhin&#x27;s story.

From 1984 until his death in 1999 he was the first guest conductor of Sinfonia Varsovia with which he performed over 300 times (nearly half of which were between 1996 and 1998). He said that &quot;working with no other orchestra gave me as much satisfaction as my work, as soloist and conductor, with the Sinfonia Varsovia Orchestra.&quot; In his &quot;Unfinished Journey: Twenty Years Later&quot; he added &quot;It was a true inspiration to spend as much time with them [Sinfonia Varsovia] as possible, to enjoy the deep satisfaction I derive from our music-making together.&quot;. In 1991, he became Principal Guest Conductor of the English Symphony Orchestra, a position he also held until his death.

In 1990 Menuhin was the first conductor for the Asian Youth Orchestra which toured around Asia, including Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong with Julian Lloyd Webber and a group of young talented musicians from all over Asia.

== Personal life ==
Menuhin was married twice, first to Nola Nicholas, daughter of an Australian industrialist and sister of Hephzibah Menuhin&#x27;s first husband Lindsay Nicholas. They had two children, Krov and Zamira (who married pianist Fou Ts&#x27;ong). Following their 1947 divorce he married the British ballerina and actress Diana Gould, whose mother was the pianist Evelyn Suart and stepfather was Admiral Sir Cecil Harcourt. The couple had two sons, Gerard, notable as a Holocaust denier and far right activist, and Jeremy, a pianist. A third child died shortly after birth. In the 1960s and 1970s they lived in Highgate at 2 The Grove, a house later owned by Sting.

The name &quot;Yehudi&quot; means &quot;Jew&quot; in Hebrew. In an interview republished in October 2004, he recounted to &quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine the story of his name:

Menuhin became an honorary citizen of Switzerland, and then also of the United Kingdom, in 1970 and 1985, respectively.

Along with Albert Einstein, Menuhin was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950–51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland.

Menuhin was a pescetarian.

===Interest in yoga===
In 1953, &quot;Life&quot; published photos of him in various esoteric yoga positions. In 1952, Menuhin was in India, where Nehru, the new nation&#x27;s first Prime Minister, introduced him to an influential yogi B. K. S. Iyengar, who was largely unknown outside the country. Menuhin arranged for Iyengar to teach abroad in London, Switzerland, Paris, and elsewhere. He became one of the first prominent yoga masters teaching in the West.

Menuhin also took lessons from Indra Devi, who opened the first yoga studio in the U.S. in Los Angeles in 1948. Both Devi and Iyengar were students of Krishnamacharya, a famous yoga master in India.

=== Death and legacy ===
Menuhin died in Martin Luther Hospital in Berlin, Germany, from complications of bronchitis. Soon after his death, the Royal Academy of Music acquired the &quot;Yehudi Menuhin Archive&quot;, which includes sheet music marked up for performance, correspondence, news articles and photographs relating to Menuhin, autograph musical manuscripts, and several portraits of Paganini.

== Violins ==
Menuhin played a number of famous violins, arguably the most renowned of which is the &quot;Lord Wilton Guarnerius 1742&quot;. Others included the &quot;Giovanni Bussetto 1680&quot;, &quot;Giovanni Grancino 1695&quot;, &quot;Guarneri filius Andrea 1703&quot;, &quot;Soil Stradivarius&quot;, &quot;Prince Khevenhüller 1733 Stradivari&quot;, and &quot;Guarneri del Gesù 1739&quot;.

In his autobiography &quot;Unfinished Journey&quot;, Menuhin wrote: &quot;A great violin is alive; its very shape embodies its maker&#x27;s intentions, and its wood stores the history, or the soul, of its successive owners. I never play without feeling that I have released or, alas, violated spirits.&quot;

== Cultural references ==
* The catchphrase &quot;Who&#x27;s Yehoodi?&quot; popular in the 1930s and 1940s was inspired by Menuhin&#x27;s guest appearance on a radio show, where Jerry Colonna turned &quot;Yehoodi&quot; into a widely recognized slang term for a mysteriously absent person. It eventually lost all of its original connection with Menuhin.
* Menuhin was also &quot;meant&quot; to appear on &quot;The 1971 Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show&quot; but could not do so as he was &quot;opening at the Argyle Theatre, Birkenhead in &quot;Old King Cole&quot;&quot;. He was replaced by Eric Morecambe in the famous &quot;Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto by Grieg&quot; sketch featuring the conductor André Previn; he was also invited to appear on their 1973 Christmas Show to play his &quot;banjo&quot; as they said playing his violin would not be any good; he ruefully said that &quot;I can&#x27;t help you&quot;.
* A picture of Menuhin as a child is sometimes used as part of a Thematic Apperception Test.
