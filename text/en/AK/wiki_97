<text>Clay County is a county in the U.S. state of South Dakota. As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,967. The county seat is Vermillion, which is also home to the University of South Dakota. The county is named for Henry Clay, American statesman, US Senator from Kentucky, and United States Secretary of State in the 19th century. Clay County comprises the Vermillion, SD [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]], which is also included in the Sioux City-Vermillion, Iowa-SD-Nebraska Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The future Clay County area was opened for legal settlement in 1859. In Autumn 1859, Ahira A. Partridge (who would become the first elected sheriff of the county) crossed the Missouri river into the Dakota territory, and became the first white man to settle, on 160 acres of land that now underlies Vermillion. In 1862 the county was formally organized. The Clay County Courthouse was built in 1912.

Clay County is the name of 17 other counties in the United States, most of them named for Henry Clay.

==Geography==
Clay County lies on the south line of South Dakota. The south boundary line of Clay County abuts the north line of the state of Nebraska (across the Missouri River). The Missouri River flows southeast along the south boundary line of Clay County. A small drainage creek flows into the county from Turner County, draining the central and eastern portions of the county and discharging into the river. Smaller drainages move water from the western county areas into the river. In addition to sloping into the drainage through the center of the county, the terrain generally slopes to the south. The area is largely devoted to agriculture.

The county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.2%) is water. It is the smallest county by area in South Dakota.

<text>Clay County is a county located in the far western part of U.S. state North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 11,089. The county seat is Hayesville.

==History==
===Early inhabitants===
The area that became Clay County has long been occupied by indigenous people. An earthwork platform mound was built around 1000 CE in modern-day Hayesville, likely by people of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture as the center of their village. The Cherokee Native Americans later constructed a town known as &quot;Quanassee&quot; at the site. Quanassee had several hundred residents by 1550. In 1716, South Carolina officials met with Cherokee leaders at Quanassee to gain the Cherokee&#x27;s alliance in the Yamassee War. The next year South Carolina built a trading site in Quanassee to provide English goods in exchange for Cherokee commodities like deerskins. A Coosa (Creek) war party &quot;cut off&quot; Quanassee in 1725, wrecking the village and enslaving or killing most of its residents. The village was briefly reestablished before the American Revolution; Rutherford expedition forces camped there in 1776.

The Unicoi Turnpike, a 1,000-year-old Native American trading route, ran through the site of Quanassee and modern-day Brasstown. In 1813, the trail was developed into a toll road from Tennessee to Georgia, creating the first highway through the area. Today Brasstown is the oldest continuous settlement in the county, having hosted residents since the establishment of the toll road.

The land which would become Clay County was claimed by Buncombe County in 1791, Haywood County by 1810, and Macon County in 1828. In the 1820s, Baptist missionaries visited Quanassee to preach to families living there. The first white settlers moved into what would become Clay County in the early 1830s. Migrants into the area were primarily of Scots-Irish descent, who had moved into the backcountry of the Appalachians from eastern areas. They moved south from Pennsylvania and Virginia after the American Revolution. Most became yeomen farmers and few owned slaves in the antebellum years. The first school in the area began operation in 1834. It was a tuition-based academy started by Leonard Butterfield on a farm near Hyatt&#x27;s Creek. From 1836–1838, the state of North Carolina surveyed and subdivided land in the area to be sold. The parcels were put on public sale in Franklin in fall 1838.

In October 1837, Tennessee militia established Fort Hembree at present-day Hayesville to prepare for deporting the Cherokee people. Approximately 1,000 Cherokee were held prisoner there and removed from the area. The U.S. Military abandoned Fort Hembree in June 1838. In 1839, most of the area became part of Cherokee County, which was formed from western Macon County.

===County formation===
In the fall of 1860, George Hayes, who was running for state representative from Cherokee County, promised his constituents to introduce legislation to organize a new county in the region. That would bring business associated with a new county seat, and make government accessible to more people. In February 1861 the legislation was introduced and passed by the North Carolina General Assembly. Clay County was formed primarily from Cherokee County, however a small area was taken from Macon County; it was named for statesman Henry Clay, former Secretary of State and member of the United States Senate from Kentucky. In honor of Mr. Hayes, the legislature designated the new county seat as Hayesville. The town was incorporated on March 12, 1913.

In 1860 Fort Hembree was reactivated to train soldiers for the Civil War. Early county trials and the first county commissioners’ meetings were held at the fort. It also contained a general store. Given the interruption of the war, Clay County lacked an organized, formal government until 1868. Hicksville Academy, which became Hayesville High School (today the county&#x27;s only public high school), was founded in 1870. In the 1890s it was bought by Duke University and offered college courses.

After the initial wood-frame county courthouse was destroyed by arson in 1870, the brick courthouse was constructed in 1888. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In mid-2007, courthouse operations moved to a new complex built west of the town square.

The first post office to open in what became Clay County began service January 8, 1844, at Fort Hembree. At its peak, Clay County boasted 17 post offices. By 1976 there were only three remaining, in Hayesville, Warne, and Brasstown.

Clay County’s borders have expanded twice since its formation. In 1872, the county annexed Buck Creek and Black Mountain from Macon County. In 1874, the county added a part of the Brasstown Creek area extending to the Georgia state line.

In the late 1870s and early 1880s the Tusquittee Turnpike toll road operated from Clay County to the Nantahala River in Macon County. Tiger’s Store is thought to be the oldest continuously operating business in Clay County. It was established around 1899 in Shooting Creek and moved to Hayesville around 1908. A ruby from Clay County is part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom.

===20th century to present===
Clay County’s two-story brick jail was built in 1912 to replace a log building. In 1972, shop class students from Hayesville High School constructed a replacement prison in downtown Hayesville. That was in use until 2008 when a new $4.3 million detention center opened at the judicial complex site. Today the brick jail is home to the Clay County Historical &amp; Arts Museum.

Clay County&#x27;s first official bank opened on May 18, 1910. A creamery opened in Brasstown in 1924. Mission Dam was constructed on the western end of the county in 1924. Gold mines operated in Tusquittee, Warne and Brasstown around the 1930s. In the 1940s and 50s, Clay County’s largest employers were band saw lumber mills. One of the county’s only manufacturing companies, Lidseen of North Carolina, Inc., has operated a metal fabrication plant in Warne since 1957. Another manufacturing plant, American Components Incorporated, made a metal film resistor for the Saturn V rocket that carried Neil Armstrong to the moon. Clay County has also manufactured ladies’ dresses, items for combat soldiers, and kitchen and bathroom fixtures.

The county’s first electric power came from a small dam across Shooting Creek near the Elf community in January 1920. The Blue Ridge Electric Association of Young Harris, Georgia, took over providing electricity for all of Clay County in 1939. By 1950, every community in the county had electricity.

The first automobile came to Clay County in 1914. From the early 1900s until the 1930s, every male citizen of Clay County between the ages of 18 and 45 was required to work five days per year without pay to help maintain public roads. Construction on US 64 between Hayesville, Warne, and Brasstown started in 1921. In 1959 a new highway was built from Hayesville through Sweetwater to Peachtree to provide Clay County residents with faster access to Andrews&#x27; new District Memorial Hospital. The US 64 moniker moved to this new route and the former route became Old Hwy. 64. US 64 connected Hayesville to Franklin in the early 1930s. NC 69 was built between Hayesville and Georgia in 1922. The entire road had to be relocated when Chatuge Lake was created twenty years later.

In October 1920, Clay County’s first and only railroad line, the Peavine, was completed between Hayesville and Andrews, where it connected with the Southern Railway. Cherokee and Clay counties each contributed $75,000 toward its construction. The Peavine hauled mainly lumber, but also kaolin mined in Clay County. The line was dismantled in 1951.

A silent film theater opened in the county in the 1920s. A movie theater later operated in Hayesville from the 1940s to the 1960s. The county has not had a movie theater since. Clay County&#x27;s public library was established by the 1930s. It began in a two-story building on Hayesville&#x27;s town square and at some point moved to a small room in the courthouse. In 1940 it became part of Nantahala Regional Library system. Its first librarian, Ellen Scroggs, was hired in 1943. A new $80,000 library building opened downtown on June 25, 1967. It was named in honor of local-born Dr. Fred A. Moss, who gave $10,000 towards its construction and donated books. Today Moss Memorial Library is the only public library in Clay County.

Chatuge Dam was constructed near Hayesville in the early 1940s by the Tennessee Valley Authority, creating Chatuge Lake. At the time, Chatuge Dam was the highest earthen dam in the world until the Aswan Dam was constructed in Egypt in 1964. The dam was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

In the 1950s, Clay County&#x27;s official song was written. Willie Forrest Standridge wrote &quot;Clay County Song&quot; to the tune of Onward Christian Soldiers. The Hinton Rural Life Center began in Clay County in 1957. It is a mission retreat operated by the United Methodist Church, serving churches across nine southeastern states and named in honor of benefactor Harold H. Hinton. The Clay County Rescue Squad was organized in 1964. The county&#x27;s first golf course opened in 1970. The Clay County Historical &amp; Arts Council was founded February 6, 1974. The Peacock Performing Arts Center, the only community theatre in far-west North Carolina, opened in Hayesville in 1986. The Clay County Chamber of Commerce began in 1986. Clay County&#x27;s building inspections department started in 1987. The famed New Year&#x27;s Eve &quot;Possum Drop&quot; was held annually in Brasstown between 1990 and 2018. The Clay County Recreation Center was built in Hayesville in 2007 and expanded in 2013. In early 2025, Amazon purchased land in the county to build a distribution center and warehouse.

Since the nineteenth century, Clay County has remained largely agricultural. Given its relative isolation, in the 21st century, residents continue to be overwhelmingly of European-American ancestry.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.63%) is water. It is the third-smallest county in North Carolina by land area and smallest by total area.

Clay County is bordered to the south by the state of Georgia and the Chattahoochee National Forest. The Nantahala River forms part of its northeastern border. The county is drained by the Hiwassee River. In the southern part of Clay County is Chatuge Lake, on the North Carolina–Georgia border. Much of Clay County exists within the Nantahala National Forest. Fires Creek Bear Reserve is north of the township of Tusquittee and offers multiple hiking trails. The Appalachian Trail winds through southeast Clay County.

Before 1941 the U.S. government purchased most of Clay County’s forest land to preserve it as National Forest Service property. The Forest Service oversees approximately 60 percent of Clay County’s land. Of Clay County&#x27;s 136,096 acres, 110,096 are forested lands, including 65,934 in the eastern part of the county owned and maintained by the federal government as part of Nantahala National Forest. As of 2024, 14,515 acres are devoted to agriculture, with a total of 178 farms. Clay County has a total of 11 dams listed on the National Inventory of Dams; six are classified as high-hazard, meaning a dam failure may be deadly.

<text>Clay County is a county in the U.S. state of Tennessee. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 7,581. Its county seat and only incorporated city is Celina. Clay County is named in honor of American statesman Henry Clay, member of the United States Senate from Kentucky and United States Secretary of State in the 19th century.

==History==
Clay County was formed in 1870 by combining pieces from surrounding Jackson and Overton counties. Secretary of State Cordell Hull&#x27;s first law office (now a museum) was located in Clay County.

Clay County&#x27;s early inhabitants farmed and worked the Cumberland River, which was the major method of transportation in the Cumberland area. There were many docks and ferry crossings throughout Clay County to transport local crops and livestock to major markets. The timber industry was a major employer throughout the 1800s and 1900s and provides many jobs today. Tobacco farming became important in the local area throughout the 1900s and many old tobacco barns are still standing. With the end of government subsidies and with foreign competition, tobacco farming is minimal. Cattle, poultry, and corn are the major agricultural influences today. Clay County is one of the top poultry-producing counties in Tennessee.

During the Civil War, many skirmishes took place up and down the Cumberland River to control the movement of barges laden with supplies. Local communities were split in their loyalties, with many families at odds with each other. Some of these animosities remain today between family groups.

The city of Celina is at the junction of the Obey and Cumberland rivers, and it was a major port during the steamboat years between Nashville and Burnside, Kentucky. Although the Celina ferry landing no longer exists, Celina still connects the north and south by highway. Butler&#x27;s Landing was used as a storage depot with large warehouses owned and operated by the Butler family. The first Clay County Court meeting was held in a store near the river at Butler&#x27;s Landing on March 6, 1871. Butler&#x27;s Landing nearly became the county seat, but Celina won the vote by a narrow margin.

Clay County&#x27;s rural location has restricted development and attraction of business and industry. This has resulted in the county having one of the highest unemployment rates annually in the state of Tennessee. The lack of jobs often results in the loss of educated young people who have limited opportunities locally. SR 52 has been upgraded to a 4-lane divided highway as part of the Corridor J project, which connects to I-40 in Cookeville, and work continues on developing a new industrial park within the Celina city limits. It is hoped this industrial park will help attract more jobs to the county. .

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (8.8%) is water. The Cumberland River flows through the center of the county from north to south, fed by the Obey River which flows through the city of Celina from its impoundment at Dale Hollow Lake, inundates much of the eastern part of the county.

==Politics==
Though a traditionally Democratic county like most of Middle Tennessee, Clay County has historically been more competitive compared to other counties in the region such as Stewart County. The county voted for GOP candidates in 1920, 1960, 1968, 1972, 1984 and 1988, and Herbert Hoover in 1928, Ronald Reagan in 1980, and George W. Bush in 2004 all came within less than 2 percentage points of winning Clay County. Like almost all of Tennessee, however, the county has turned solidly Republican in the 2010s.

<text>Clay County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,051. Its county seat is Clay. The county was founded in 1858 and named in honor of Henry Clay, famous American statesman, member of the United States Senate from Kentucky and United States Secretary of State in the 19th century.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Clay County was divided into four districts: Buffalo, Henry, Pleasant, and Union. A fifth district, Otter, was created from part of Henry in 1876. Between 1990 and 2000, these districts were consolidated into Districts A, B, and C. Though it does have access to an interstate highway, the county has no traffic lights or public transportation.

<text>Clay County is a county located in the U.S. state of Arkansas. Originally incorporated as Clayton County, as of the 2020 United States census, its population was 14,552. The county has two county seats, Corning and Piggott. It is a dry county, in which the sale of alcoholic beverages is restricted or prohibited.

==History==
When Clay County was created as Arkansas&#x27;s 67th county on 24 March 1873 (along with Baxter County), it was named Clayton County, after John M. Clayton, then a member of the Arkansas Senate and a brother of then-U.S. Senator Powell Clayton, though some sources suggest it may have been named for Powell Clayton instead.

Two years later on 6 December 1875, the county&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;Clay&quot; by the Arkansas General Assembly. Some claim it was renamed for the statesman Henry Clay, while others say John M. Clayton remained its official namesake. The name change apparently was inspired by lingering distrust of Powell Clayton, as he had declared martial law and suspended elections in the county in 1868 when he was Governor of Arkansas and it was still part of Greene County.

The first county seat was Corning, established in 1873, with the arrival of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway, as the first incorporated town in the county. The county seat was moved to Boydsville in 1877, in what was known as &quot;Old Bradshaw Field&quot;, because people living east of the Black and Cache Rivers had difficulty getting to Corning during the flood season. However, this caused problems for those living west of the rivers, and in 1881 Corning was re-established as the seat of the Western District, with Boydsville remaining the seat for the Eastern District. With the arrival of the St. Louis, Arkansas and Texas Railroad in 1882, other towns such as Greenway, Rector and Piggott experienced growth. In 1887, the Eastern District seat was moved to Piggott, and the dual county seat system remains in place today. Important county functions (such as the Quorum Court) alternate between Piggott and Corning as their venues.

In the early 20th century, Clay, Greene, and Craighead counties had sundown town policies forbidding African Americans from living in the area.

On 6 April 1972, Sheriff Douglas Batey and deputies Glen Ray Archer and Troy Key were shot and killed while trying to serve a warrant on Bert Grissom. Grissom opened fire as soon as the men stepped out of their car. He later surrendered without resistance to another deputy, and was tried, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison. William Thomas Pond became sheriff, but he died in an automobile accident on 8 June 1973. Four of the five police officers who have lost their lives serving the Clay County Sheriff&#x27;s Office died in these two incidents.

==Politics==











Clay County has been rock-ribbed Republican since the Civil War, having last voted for a Democratic nominee for president in 1860 when it supported Kentucky native and Southern Democrat John C. Breckinridge. In the last one hundred years the only Republicans to receive less than sixty percent were Bob Dole, who still won the county by nearly 25 percent, and Barry Goldwater, who held the county by seventy-five votes amidst a Democratic landslide in 1964. In 2008 John McCain received 77.5% of the vote., and in 2024 three time GOP nominee Donald Trump posted nearly 90% of Clay&#x27;s vote, which was the highest total in the county&#x27;s history.

===Elected officials===
==Health==
In July 2010, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; named Clay County the unhealthiest county in Kentucky, and one of the unhealthiest in the nation. Clay County also featured prominently in a June 2014 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the difficulty of living in poverty in eastern Kentucky, ranking last in overall ratings for counties in the United States. The factors which accounted for Clay county&#x27;s low ranking were unemployment, prevalence of disabilities, obesity, income, and education. The &quot;Times&quot; declared Clay County the &quot;hardest place to live in the U.S.&quot;

===Life expectancy===
Of 3,142 counties in the United States in 2014, Clay County ranked 3,137 in the longevity of female residents and 3,109 in the longevity of male residents. Males in Clay County lived an average of 68.6 years and females lived an average of 73.6 years compared to the national average for longevity of 76.5 for males and 81.2 for females. Moreover, the average longevity in Clay County declined by 0.4 years for males and 3.4 years for females between 1985 and 2014 compared to a national average for the same period of an increased life span of 5.5 years for men and 3.1 years for women. High rates of smoking and obesity and a low level of physical activity appear to be contributing factors to the lowered longevity for both sexes.

<text>Clay County is a county located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 2,848, making it the fourth-least populous county in Georgia. The county seat is Fort Gaines.

==History==
This area was historically occupied by the Creek Indians until Indian Removal in the 1830s. European Americans pushed them out and developed the land for cotton, bringing in thousands of African slaves to work the land.

The county is named in honor of Henry Clay, famous American statesman, member of the United States Senate from Kentucky and United States Secretary of State in the 19th century. Part of the Black Belt geological formation of Georgia, prior to the American Civil War the county&#x27;s chief commodity crop was cotton, cultivated and processed by farmers and African-American slaves. After the war, the economy continued to be agricultural, but timber was also harvested.

Clay was created by a February 16, 1854, act of the Georgia General Assembly, and organized from portions of Early and Randolph counties.

Clay County&#x27;s population is one-third of what it was in 1910.

George Lake sub-basin of the same ACF River Basin. Just the very southeastern corner of Clay County is located in the Spring Creek sub-basin of the same larger ACF River Basin.

<doc id="57794" wikidata="Q1440551" url="?curid=57794" title="Fractal antenna">
<text>A fractal antenna is an antenna that uses a fractal, self-similar design to maximize the effective length, or increase the perimeter (on inside sections or the outer structure), of material that can receive or transmit electromagnetic radiation within a given total surface area or volume.

Such fractal antennas are also referred to as multilevel and space filling curves, but the key aspect lies in their repetition of a motif over two or more scale sizes, or &quot;iterations&quot;. For this reason, fractal antennas are very compact, multiband or wideband, and have useful applications in cellular telephone and microwave communications.
A fractal antenna&#x27;s response differs markedly from traditional antenna designs, in that it is capable of operating with good-to-excellent performance at many different frequencies simultaneously. Normally, standard antennas have to be &quot;cut&quot; for the frequency for which they are to be used—and thus the standard antennas only work well at that frequency.

In addition, the fractal nature of the antenna shrinks its size, without the use of any extra components such as inductors or capacitors.

==Log-periodic antennas==
Log-periodic antennas are arrays invented in 1952 and commonly seen as TV antennas. This was long before Mandelbrot coined the word &quot;fractal&quot; in 1975. Some authors (for instance Cohen) consider log-periodic antennas to be an early form of fractal antenna due to their infinite self similarity at all scales. However, they have a finite length even in the theoretical limit with an infinite number of elements and therefore do not have a fractal dimension that exceeds their topological dimension – which is one way of defining fractals. More typically, (for instance Pandey) authors treat them as a separate but related class of antenna.

==Performance ==
Antenna elements (as opposed to antenna arrays, which are usually not included as fractal antennas) made from self-similar shapes were first created by Nathan Cohen then a professor at Boston University, starting in 1988. Cohen&#x27;s efforts with a variety of fractal antenna designs were first published in 1995, which marked the inaugural scientific publication on fractal antennas.

Many fractal element antennas use the fractal structure as a virtual combination of capacitors and inductors. This makes the antenna so that it has many different resonances, which can be chosen and adjusted by choosing the proper fractal design. This complexity arises because the current on the structure has a complex arrangement caused by the inductance and self capacitance. In general, although their effective electrical length is longer, the fractal element antennas are themselves physically smaller, again due to this reactive loading.

Thus, fractal element antennas are shrunken compared to conventional designs and do not need additional components, assuming the structure happens to have the desired resonant input impedance. In general, the fractal dimension of a fractal antenna is a poor predictor of its performance and application. Not all fractal antennas work well for a given application or set of applications. Computer search methods and antenna simulations are commonly used to identify which fractal antenna designs best meet the needs of the application.

Studies during the 2000s showed advantages of the fractal element technology in real-life applications, such as RFID
and cell phones.
Fractals have been used commercially in antennas since the 2010s.
Their advantages are good multiband performance, wide bandwidth, and small area.
The gain with small size results from constructive interference with multiple current maxima, afforded by the electrically long structure in a small area.

Some researchers have disputed that fractal antennas have superior performance. S.R. Best (2003) observed &quot;that antenna geometry alone, fractal or otherwise, does not uniquely determine the electromagnetic properties of the small antenna&quot;.
Hansen &amp; Collin (2011) reviewed many papers on fractal antennas and concluded that they offer no advantage over fat dipoles, loaded dipoles, or simple loops, and that non-fractals are always better.
Balanis (2011) reported on several fractal antennas and found them equivalent in performance to the electrically small antennas they were compared to.
Log periodics, a form of fractal antenna, have their electromagnetic characteristics uniquely determined by geometry, via an opening angle.

==Frequency invariance and Maxwell&#x27;s equations==
One different and useful attribute of some fractal element antennas is their self-scaling aspect. In 1957, V.H. Rumsey presented results that angle-defined scaling was one of the underlying requirements to make antennas invariant (have same radiation properties) at a number, or range, of frequencies. Work by Y. Mushiake in Japan starting in 1948 demonstrated similar results of frequency independent antennas having self-complementarity.

It was believed that antennas had to be defined by angles for this to be true, but in 1999 it was discovered that &quot;self-similarity was one of the underlying requirements to make antennas frequency and bandwidth invariant&quot;. In other words, the self-similar aspect was the underlying requirement, along with origin symmetry, for frequency independence. Angle-defined antennas are self-similar, but other self-similar antennas are frequency independent although not angle-defined.

This analysis, based on Maxwell&#x27;s equations, showed fractal antennas offer a closed-form and unique insight into a key aspect of electromagnetic phenomena. To wit: the invariance property of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. This is now known as the Hohlfeld-Cohen-Rumsey (HCR) Principle. Mushiake&#x27;s earlier work on self complementarity was shown to be limited to impedance smoothness, as expected from Babinet&#x27;s Principle, but not frequency invariance.

== Other uses ==
In addition to their use as antennas, fractals have also found application in other antenna system components, including loads, counterpoises, and ground planes.

Fractal inductors and fractal tuned circuits (fractal resonators) were also discovered and invented simultaneously with fractal element antennas. An emerging example of such is in metamaterials. A recent invention demonstrates using close-packed fractal resonators to make the first wideband metamaterial invisibility cloak at microwave frequencies.

Fractal filters (a type of tuned circuit) are another example where the superiority of the fractal approach for smaller size and better rejection has been proven.

As fractals can be used as counterpoises, loads, ground planes, and filters, all parts that can be integrated with antennas, they are considered parts of some antenna &quot;systems&quot; and thus are discussed in the context of fractal antennas.

<doc id="57795" wikidata="Q695774" url="?curid=57795" title="Georgetown, Ascension Island">
<text>Georgetown is the capital and chief settlement of Ascension Island, in the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, situated on the west coast of the island.

The town is centred on St Mary&#x27;s Church, part of the Anglican Diocese of St Helena and the former Exiles Club, built as a Royal Marines barracks at the time of Napoleon&#x27;s exile to Saint Helena in the early 19th century.

It is named after King George III, who reigned at the time the island was claimed for Britain and garrisoned by the Admiralty in 1815.

In addition to the church, there is a pier, an athletics track, a small supermarket, Royal Mail post office (and probably Internet connections), snack bar, hotel, police station, Georgetown Hospital, dental surgery, and a library. There is no school, however, and pupils travel to Two Boats village, 3 miles inland, in the center of the island.

==Naval history==
A naval base was established at Georgetown in 1816 due to British concerns that the French might make use of the island to attempt a rescue of their exiled former Emperor.

Following Napoleon&#x27;s death in 1821 (and George III&#x27;s the year before), the settlement found a new role as a supply, maintenance and victualling base for the West Africa Squadron. Local tufa was used for building, but everything else had to be imported (including seeds, vegetables and fruit trees, all of which were cultivated on Green Mountain to supplement the locally-available diet of turtle meat).

By 1829, a small jetty had been constructed, as well as several buildings on what is now the Regent Square area, close to the sea (including a hospital – the West Africa Squadron was notoriously prone to sickness).

In June 1829, a Lieutenant of the Royal Engineers, Henry Brandreth, arrived on Ascension with a remit to survey the facilities there and make recommendations for their improvement. He condemned what he found as, for the most part, &#x27;miserable tenements ... inhabited by vermin&#x27;. Together, with the local commandant, he recommended re-establishing the settlement a little way back from the sea, on the elevated &quot;plateau&quot; which Georgetown occupies today. Having returned to England to oversee the supply and manufacture of certain items for the island, he returned in 1830 to begin work on this project. A key innovation was the construction of St George&#x27;s Water Tank, which can still be seen today: water was channelled to it from the mountain top, as well as from every roof in Georgetown, and from here it was fed by a windpump into a header tank for distribution to local buildings (and, via a pipeline, to the pierhead for transfer to ships). The Marine Barracks building also dates from this period, as do several other buildings including Georgetown&#x27;s hospital, which continues to fulfil the purpose for which it was built.

The site of the old settlement, closer to the sea, was then used for storage and maintenance (the surviving Main Storehouse of 1848 was once claimed to be the largest building in the southern hemisphere). Before long, to meet the demands of an increasingly steam-powered navy, coaling facilities were built, and in 1862 a &#x27;steam factory&#x27; housing metalworkers, a machine shop and smelting works, was established.

Georgetown continued to serve as a strategic base for the Navy through the 20th century, though after 1899 the site was increasingly administered by the Eastern Telegraph Company. When in 1922 the Board of the Admiralty ceded Ascension Island to the Colonial Office, an exchange of correspondence indicates that one thing its officials wished to preserve was their annual gift of turtle soup from Georgetown (an annual perquisite apparently enjoyed since 1816).

===Forts===
On 22 October 1815, HMS &quot;Peruvian&quot; and HMS &quot;Zenobia&quot; anchored in the roadstead off Georgetown to claim the island for the British Crown. Once ashore, one of the first tasks undertaken by the sailors was to set up a pair of cannons on the promontory in the harbour to provide some defence. This battery became known as Fort Cockburn (renamed in the middle of the century Fort Thornton).

A second fort was established on a site called Goat Hill further to the west in around 1860 (Fort Hayes) and a third, Fort Bedford, on the hill overlooking the town called Cross Hill. Fort Bedford, which dates from 1903, still has some Victorian cannons, as well as a pair of BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval guns that were originally fitted to . These guns were used to repel a German attack by &quot;U-124&quot; on 9 December 1941 during World War II with surprisingly great success as the Germans did not approach the island again. Fort Hayes until recently housed the museum of the Ascension Island Heritage Society.

==Present-day Georgetown==
The town is a centre of culture on Ascension. It usually hosts local athletics events as well as being the start of the annual dew pond race from sea level to the highest point on the island on Green Mountain. Ascension Day activities (to celebrate the discovery of Ascension) are either hosted here or in nearby Two Boats village. the population was about 450. Nearby Long Beach is an important nesting ground for the giant green turtle.

==Georgetown Cemetery==

A cemetery was begun some time in the early 19th century. It was used both for deaths on the island and for burial of persons dying on ships within one day&#x27;s sail of the island. Graves of note include Captain William Bafe and his crew, and Commodore Reginald Thomas John Levinge of the Levinge baronets.

<doc id="57799" wikidata="Q206534" url="?curid=57799" title="Stephen Crane">
<text>Stephen Crane (November 1, 1871 – June 5, 1900) was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer. Prolific throughout his short life, he wrote notable works in the Realist tradition as well as early examples of American Naturalism and Impressionism. He is recognized by modern critics as one of the most innovative writers of his generation.

The ninth surviving child of Methodist parents, Crane began writing at the age of four and had several articles published by 16. Having little interest in university studies though he was active in a fraternity, he left Syracuse University in 1891 to work as a reporter and writer. Crane&#x27;s first novel was the 1893 Bowery tale &quot;&quot;, generally considered by critics to be the first work of American literary Naturalism. He won international acclaim for his Civil War novel &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; (1895), considered a masterpiece by critics and writers.

In 1896, Crane endured a highly publicized scandal after appearing as a witness in the trial of a suspected prostitute, an acquaintance named Dora Clark. Late that year, he accepted an offer to travel to Cuba as a war correspondent. As he waited in Jacksonville, Florida, for passage, he met Cora Taylor, with whom he began a lasting relationship. En route to Cuba, Crane&#x27;s vessel, the SS &quot;Commodore&quot;, sank off the coast of Florida, leaving him adrift for 30 hours in a dinghy. Crane described the ordeal in &quot;The Open Boat&quot;. During the final years of his life, he covered conflicts in Greece (accompanied by Cora, recognized as the first woman war correspondent) and later lived in England with her. He was befriended by writers such as Joseph Conrad and H. G. Wells. Plagued by financial difficulties and ill health, Crane died of tuberculosis in a Black Forest sanatorium in Germany at the age of 28.

At the time of his death, Crane was considered an important figure in American literature. After he was nearly forgotten for two decades, critics revived interest in his life and work. Crane&#x27;s writing is characterized by vivid intensity, distinctive dialects, and irony. Common themes involve fear, spiritual crises and social isolation. Although recognized primarily for &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, which has become an American classic, Crane is also known for his poetry, journalism, and short stories such as &quot;The Open Boat&quot;, &quot;The Blue Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky&quot;, and &quot;The Monster&quot;. His writing made a deep impression on 20th-century writers, most prominent among them Ernest Hemingway, and is thought to have inspired the Modernists and the Imagists.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Stephen Crane was born on November 1, 1871, in Newark, New Jersey, to Jonathan Townley Crane, a minister in the Methodist Episcopal church, and Mary Helen Peck Crane, daughter of a clergyman, George Peck. He was the fourteenth and last child born to the couple. At 45, Helen Crane had suffered the deaths of her previous four children in infancy. Nicknamed &quot;Stevie&quot; by the family, he joined eight surviving brothers and sisters—Mary Helen, George Peck, Jonathan Townley, William Howe, Agnes Elizabeth, Edmund Byran, Wilbur Fiske, and Luther.

The Cranes were descended from Jaspar Crane, a founder of New Haven Colony, who had migrated there from England in 1639. Stephen was named for a putative founder of Elizabethtown, New Jersey, who had, according to family tradition, come from England or Wales in 1665, as well as his great-great-grandfather Stephen Crane, a Revolutionary War patriot who served as New Jersey delegate to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Crane later wrote that his father &quot;was a great, fine, simple mind&quot;, who had written numerous tracts on theology. Although his mother was a popular spokeswoman for the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union and a highly religious woman, Crane wrote that he did not believe &quot;she was as narrow as most of her friends or family.&quot; The young Stephen was raised primarily by his sister Agnes, 15 years his senior. The family moved to Port Jervis, New York, in 1876, where Dr. Crane became the pastor of Drew Methodist Church, a position that he retained until his death.

As a child, Crane was often sickly and afflicted by constant colds. When the boy was almost two, his father wrote in his diary that his youngest son became &quot;so sick that we are anxious about him.&quot; Despite his fragile nature, Crane was an intelligent child who taught himself to read before the age of four. At the age of three, while imitating his brother Townley&#x27;s writing, he asked his mother, &quot;how do you spell &quot;O&quot;?&quot; In December 1879, Crane wrote a poem about wanting a dog for Christmas. Entitled &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Have –&quot;, it is his first surviving poem. Stephen was not regularly enrolled in school until January 1880, but he had no difficulty in completing two grades in six weeks. Recalling this feat, he wrote that it &quot;sounds like the lie of a fond mother at a teaparty, but I do remember that I got ahead very fast and that father was very pleased with me.&quot;

Dr. Crane died on February 16, 1880, at the age of 60; Stephen was eight years old. Some 1,400 people attended his funeral, more than double the size of his congregation. After her husband&#x27;s death, Mrs. Crane moved to Roseville, near Newark, leaving Stephen in the care of his older brother Edmund, with whom the young boy lived with cousins in Sussex County. He next lived with his brother William, a lawyer, in Port Jervis for several years.

His older sister Helen took him to Asbury Park to be with their brother Townley and his wife, Fannie. Townley was a professional journalist; he headed the Long Branch department of both the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; and the Associated Press, and also served as editor of the &quot;Asbury Park Shore Press&quot;. Agnes, another Crane sister, joined the siblings in New Jersey. She took a position at Asbury Park&#x27;s intermediate school and moved in with Helen to care for the young Stephen.

Within a couple of years, the Crane family suffered more losses. First, Townley and his wife lost their two young children. His wife Fannie died of Bright&#x27;s disease in November 1883. Agnes Crane became ill and died on June 10, 1884, of meningitis at the age of 28.

===Schooling===
Crane wrote his first known story, &quot;Uncle Jake and the Bell Handle&quot;, when he was 14. In late 1885, he enrolled at Pennington Seminary, a ministry-focused coeducational boarding school north of Trenton. His father had been principal there from 1849 to 1858. Soon after her youngest son left for school, Mrs. Crane began suffering what the &quot;Asbury Park Shore Press&quot; reported as &quot;a temporary aberration of the mind.&quot; She had apparently recovered by early 1886, but later that year, her son, 23-year-old Luther Crane, died after falling in front of an oncoming train while working as a railroad flagman. It was the fourth death in six years among Stephen&#x27;s immediate family.
After two years, Crane left Pennington for Claverack College, a quasi-military school. He later looked back on his time at Claverack as &quot;the happiest period of my life although I was not aware of it.&quot; A classmate remembered him as a highly literate but erratic student, lucky to pass examinations in math and science, and yet &quot;far in advance of his fellow students in his knowledge of History and Literature&quot;, his favorite subjects. While he held an impressive record on the drill field and baseball diamond, Crane generally did not excel in the classroom. Not having a middle name, as was customary among other students, he took to signing his name &quot;Stephen T. Crane&quot; in order &quot;to win recognition as a regular fellow&quot;. Crane was seen as friendly, but also moody and rebellious. He sometimes skipped class to play baseball, a game in which he starred as catcher. He was also greatly interested in the school&#x27;s military training. He rose rapidly in the ranks of the student battalion. One classmate described him as &quot;indeed physically attractive without being handsome&quot;, but he was aloof, reserved and not generally popular. Although academically weak, Crane gained experience at Claverack that provided background (and likely some anecdotes from the Civil War veterans on the staff) for &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;.
In mid-1888, Crane became his brother Townley&#x27;s assistant at a New Jersey shore news bureau, working there every summer until 1892. Crane&#x27;s first publication under his byline was an article on the explorer Henry M. Stanley&#x27;s quest to find the Scottish missionary David Livingstone in Africa. It appeared in the February 1890 Claverack College &quot;Vidette&quot;. Within a few months, Crane was persuaded by his family to forgo a military career and transfer to Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, to pursue a mining engineering degree. He registered at Lafayette on September 12; he promptly took up baseball again and joined the largest fraternity, Delta Upsilon. He also joined both rival literary societies, named for (George) Washington and (Benjamin) Franklin. Crane infrequently attended classes and ended the semester with grades for four of his seven courses.

After one semester, Crane transferred to Syracuse University, where he enrolled as a non-degree candidate in the College of Liberal Arts. He roomed in the Delta Upsilon fraternity house and joined the baseball team. Attending just one class (English Literature) during the middle trimester, he remained in residence while taking no courses in the third.

Concentrating on his writing, Crane began to experiment with tone and style while trying out different subjects. He published his fictional story, &quot;Great Bugs of Onondaga,&quot; simultaneously in the &quot;Syracuse Daily Standard&quot; and the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. Declaring college &quot;a waste of time&quot;, Crane decided to become a full-time writer and reporter. He attended a Delta Upsilon chapter meeting on June 12, 1891, but shortly afterward left college for good.

===Full-time writer===
In the summer of 1891, Crane often camped with friends in the nearby area of Sullivan County, New York, where his brother Edmund occupied a house obtained as part of their brother William&#x27;s Hartwood Club (Association) land dealings. He used this area as the geographic setting for several short stories, which were posthumously published in a collection under the title &quot;Stephen Crane: Sullivan County Tales and Sketches&quot;. Crane showed two of these works to &quot;New York Tribune&quot; editor Willis Fletcher Johnson, a family friend, who accepted them for publication. &quot;Hunting Wild Dogs&quot; and &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; were the first of fourteen unsigned Sullivan County sketches and tales published in the &quot;Tribune&quot; between February and July 1892. Crane also showed Johnson an early draft of his first novel, &quot;&quot;.

Later that summer, Crane met and befriended author Hamlin Garland, who had been lecturing locally on American literature and arts. On August 17, Garland gave a talk on novelist William Dean Howells, which Crane wrote up for the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Garland became a mentor for and champion of the young writer, whose intellectual honesty impressed him. Their relationship suffered in later years, however, because Garland disapproved of Crane&#x27;s alleged immorality, related to his living with a woman married to another man.

Stephen moved into his brother Edmund&#x27;s house in Lakeview, a suburb of Paterson, New Jersey, in the fall of 1891. From there he made frequent trips into New York City, writing and reporting, particularly on its impoverished tenement districts. Crane focused particularly on The Bowery, a small and once prosperous neighborhood in southern Manhattan. After the Civil War, Bowery shops and mansions had given way to saloons, dance halls, brothels and flophouses, all of which Crane frequented. He later said he did so for research. He was attracted to the human nature found in the slums, considering it &quot;open and plain, with nothing hidden.&quot; Believing nothing honest and unsentimental had been written about the Bowery, Crane became determined to do so himself; this was the setting of his first novel. On December 7, 1891, Crane&#x27;s mother died at the age of 64, and the 20-year-old appointed Edmund as his guardian.

In the spring of 1892, Crane began a romance with Lily Brandon Munroe, a married woman who was estranged from her husband. He did so despite being frail, undernourished, and suffering from a hacking cough – none of which prevented him from smoking cigarettes. Although Munroe later said Crane &quot;was not a handsome man,&quot; she admired his &quot;remarkable almond-shaped gray eyes.&quot; He begged her to elope with him, but her family opposed the match because Crane lacked money and prospects, and she declined. Their last meeting likely occurred in April 1898.
Between July 2 and September 11, 1892, Crane published more than ten news reports on Asbury Park affairs. Although a &quot;Tribune&quot; colleague stated that Crane &quot;was not highly distinguished above any other boy of twenty who had gained a reputation for saying and writing bright things,&quot; that summer his reporting took on a more skeptical, hypocrisy-deflating tone. A storm of controversy erupted over a report he wrote on the Junior Order of United American Mechanics&#x27; American Day Parade, titled &quot;Parades and Entertainments.&quot; Published on August 21, the report juxtaposes the &quot;bronzed, slope-shouldered, uncouth&quot; marching men &quot;begrimed with dust&quot; and the spectators dressed in &quot;summer gowns, lace parasols, tennis trousers, straw hats and indifferent smiles.&quot; Believing they were being ridiculed, some JOUAM marchers were outraged and wrote to the editor. The owner of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Whitelaw Reid, was that year&#x27;s Republican vice-presidential candidate, and this likely increased the sensitivity of the paper&#x27;s management to the issue. Although Townley wrote a piece for the &quot;Asbury Park Daily Press&quot; in his brother&#x27;s defense, the &quot;Tribune&quot; quickly apologized to its readers, calling Stephen Crane&#x27;s piece &quot;a bit of random correspondence, passed inadvertently by the copy editor.&quot; Hamlin Garland and biographer John Barry attested that Crane told them he had been dismissed by the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Although Willis Fletcher Johnson later denied this, the paper did not publish any of Crane&#x27;s work after 1892.

===Life in New York===

Crane struggled to make a living as a freelance writer, contributing sketches and feature articles to various New York newspapers. In October 1892, he moved into a rooming house in Manhattan whose boarders were a group of medical students. During this time, he expanded or entirely reworked &quot;Maggie: A Girl of the Streets&quot;. In the winter of 1893, Crane took the manuscript of &quot;Maggie&quot; to Richard Watson Gilder, who rejected it for publication in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;.

Crane decided to publish it privately, with money he had inherited from his mother. The novella was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: &quot;A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane.&quot; The name &quot;Maggie&quot; was added to the title later. Crane used the pseudonym &quot;Johnston Smith&quot; for the novella&#x27;s initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the &quot;nom de plume&quot; was the &quot;commonest name I could think of. I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the &#x27;t&#x27;, and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths&quot;. Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of &quot;The Arena&quot;, calling it &quot;the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is&quot;. Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100 copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. He would later remember &quot;how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first loves.&quot;

In March 1893, Crane spent hours in Linson&#x27;s studio having his portrait painted. He became fascinated with issues of the &quot;Century&quot; that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the Civil War. Frustrated with the dryly written stories, Crane stated, &quot;I wonder that some of those fellows don&#x27;t tell how they &quot;felt&quot; in those scraps. They spout enough of what they &quot;did&quot;, but they&#x27;re as emotionless as rocks.&quot; Crane returned to these magazines during subsequent visits to Linson&#x27;s studio, and eventually the idea of writing a war novel overtook him. He would later state that he &quot;had been unconsciously working the detail of the story out through most of his boyhood&quot; and had imagined &quot;war stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers&quot;. This novel would ultimately become &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;.
Crane wished to show how it felt to be in a war by writing &quot;a psychological portrayal of fear&quot;. Conceiving his story from the point of view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war and then quickly becomes disillusioned, Crane borrowed the private&#x27;s surname, &quot;Fleming&quot;, from his sister-in-law&#x27;s maiden name. He later said that the first paragraphs came to him with &quot;every word in place, every comma, every period fixed&quot;. He wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. Because he could not afford a typewriter, he wrote carefully in ink on legal-sized paper, seldom crossing through or interlining a word. If he did change something, he would rewrite the whole page.

While working on his second novel, Crane remained prolific, concentrating on publishing stories to stave off poverty; &quot;An Experiment in Misery&quot;, based on Crane&#x27;s experiences in the Bowery, was printed by the &quot;New York Press&quot;. He also wrote five or six poems a day. In early 1894, he showed some of his poems to Hamlin Garland, who said he read &quot;some thirty in all&quot; with &quot;growing wonder&quot;. Although Garland and William Dean Howells encouraged him to submit his poetry for publication, Crane&#x27;s free verse was too unconventional for most. After brief wrangling between poet and publisher, Copeland &amp; Day accepted Crane&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;The Black Riders and Other Lines&quot;, although it would not be published until after &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;. He received a 10 percent royalty and the publisher assured him that the book would be in a form &quot;more severely classic than any book ever yet issued in America&quot;.

In the spring of 1894, Crane offered the finished manuscript of &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; to &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which had become the foremost magazine for Civil War literature. While &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; delayed giving him an answer on his novel, they offered him an assignment writing about the Pennsylvania coal mines. &quot;In the Depths of a Coal Mine&quot;, a story with pictures by Linson, was syndicated by &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; in a number of newspapers, heavily edited. Crane was reportedly disgusted by the cuts, asking Linson, &quot;Why the hell did they send me up there then? Do they want the public to think the coal mines gilded ball-rooms with the miners eating ice-cream in boiled shirt-fronts?&quot;

During the early part of his career, Crane was promoted by Elbert Hubbard, who commented on his works and featured them in his popular small magazine, &quot;The Philistine&quot;. Crane was the guest of honor at the first annual meeting of the Society of Philistines in 1895 when he was relatively unknown. Although Crane was severely teased during the meeting, they remained friendly and their association proved mutually beneficial. Seven of Crane’s poems and a short story were published in the first issue of &quot;The Roycroft Quarterly&quot; (another of Hubbard’s magazines) which commemorated the event. In a concluding note, Hubbard commented, &quot;to the mass, he is known, if at all, only as the author of &quot;The Black Riders&quot; in verse, and of the &quot;Red Badge of Courage&quot; in prose; efforts, both, that challenge study and baffle understanding rather than soothe superficiality or pander to the wishes of mental indolence.&quot;

Sources report that following an encounter with a male prostitute that spring, Crane began a novel on the subject entitled &quot;Flowers of Asphalt,&quot; which he later abandoned. The manuscript has never been recovered.

After discovering that &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; could not afford to pay him, Crane took his war novel to Irving Bacheller of the Bacheller-Johnson Newspaper Syndicate, which agreed to publish &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; in serial form. From December 3 to 9, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; was published in some half-dozen newspapers in the United States. Although it was greatly cut for syndication, Bacheller attested to its causing a stir, saying &quot;its quality [was] immediately felt and recognized.&quot; The lead editorial in the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot; of December 7 said that Crane &quot;is a new name now and unknown, but everybody will be talking about him if he goes on as he has begun&quot;.

===Travels and fame===

At the end of January 1895, Crane left on what he called &quot;a very long and circuitous newspaper trip&quot; to the west. While writing feature articles for the Bacheller syndicate, he traveled to Saint Louis, Missouri, Nebraska, New Orleans, Galveston, Texas, and Mexico City. Irving Bacheller would later state that he &quot;sent Crane to Mexico for new color&quot;, which the author found in the form of Mexican slum life. Whereas he found the lower class in New York pitiful, he was impressed by the &quot;superiority&quot; of the Mexican peasants&#x27; contentment and &quot;even refuse[d] to pity them&quot;.

Returning to New York five months later, Crane joined the Lantern (alternately spelled &quot;Lanthom&quot; or &quot;Lanthorne&quot;) Club organized by a group of young writers and journalists. The club, located on the roof of an old house on William Street near the Brooklyn Bridge, served as a drinking establishment and was decorated to look like a ship&#x27;s cabin. There Crane ate one good meal a day, although friends were troubled by his &quot;constant smoking, too much coffee, lack of food and poor teeth&quot;, as Nelson Greene put it. Living in near-poverty and greatly anticipating the publication of his books, Crane began work on two more novels: &quot;The Third Violet&quot; and &quot;George&#x27;s Mother&quot;.

&quot;The Black Riders&quot; was published by Copeland &amp; Day shortly before his return to New York in May, but it received mostly negative criticism for the poems&#x27; unconventional style and use of free verse. A piece in the &quot;Bookman&quot; called Crane &quot;the Aubrey Beardsley of poetry&quot; and a commentator from the &quot;Chicago Daily Inter-Ocean&quot; stated that &quot;there is not a line of poetry from the opening to the closing page. Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; were luminous in comparison. Poetic lunacy would be a better name for the book.&quot; In June, the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; dismissed the book as &quot;so much trash&quot;. Crane was pleased that the book was &quot;making some stir&quot;.

In contrast to the reception for Crane&#x27;s poetry, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; was welcomed with acclaim after its publication by Appleton in September 1895. For the next four months, the book was in the top six on bestseller lists around the country. It arrived on the literary scene &quot;like a flash of lightning out of a clear winter sky&quot;, according to H. L. Mencken, who was about 15 at the time. The novel also became popular in Britain; Joseph Conrad, a future friend of Crane, wrote that the novel &quot;detonated... with the impact and force of a twelve-inch shell charged with a very high explosive&quot;. Appleton published two, possibly three, printings in 1895 and as many as eleven more in 1896. Although some critics considered the work overly graphic and profane, it was widely heralded for its realistic portrayal of war and unique writing style. The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; declared that &quot;The Red Badge&quot; would give readers &quot;so vivid a picture of the emotions and the horrors of the battlefield that you will pray your eyes may never look upon the reality.&quot;

Wanting to capitalize on the success of &quot;The Red Badge&quot;, McClure Syndicate offered Crane a contract to write a series on Civil War battlefields. Because it was a wish of his to &quot;visit the battlefield—which I was to describe—at the time of year when it was fought&quot;, Crane agreed. Visiting battlefields in Northern Virginia, including Fredericksburg, he would later produce five more Civil War tales: &quot;Three Miraculous Soldiers&quot;, &quot;The Veteran&quot;, &quot;An Indiana Campaign&quot;, &quot;An Episode of War&quot; and &quot;The Little Regiment&quot;.

===Scandal===
At the age of 24, Crane, who was reveling in his success, became involved in a highly publicized case involving a suspected prostitute named Dora Clark. At 2 a.m. on September 16, 1896, he escorted two chorus girls and Clark from New York City&#x27;s Broadway Garden, a popular &quot;resort&quot; where he had interviewed the women for a series he was writing. As Crane saw one woman safely to a streetcar, a plainclothes policeman named Charles Becker arrested the other two for solicitation; Crane was threatened with arrest when he tried to interfere. One of the women was released after Crane confirmed her erroneous claim that she was his wife, but Clark was charged and taken to the precinct. Against the advice of the arresting sergeant, Crane made a statement confirming Dora Clark&#x27;s innocence, stating that &quot;I only know that while with me she acted respectably, and that the policeman&#x27;s charge was false.&quot; On the basis of Crane&#x27;s testimony, Clark was discharged. The media seized upon the story; news spread to Philadelphia, Boston and beyond, with papers focusing on Crane&#x27;s courage. The &quot;Stephen Crane story&quot;, as it became known, soon became a source for ridicule; the &quot;Chicago Dispatch&quot; quipped that &quot;Stephen Crane is respectfully informed that association with women in scarlet is not necessarily a &#x27;Red Badge of Courage.&#x27; &quot;

A couple of weeks after her trial, Clark pressed charges of false arrest against the officer who had arrested her. The next day, the officer physically attacked Clark in the presence of witnesses. Crane, who initially went briefly to Philadelphia to escape the pressure of publicity, returned to New York to give testimony at Becker&#x27;s trial despite advice given to him from Theodore Roosevelt, who was Police Commissioner and a new acquaintance of Crane. The defense targeted Crane: police raided his apartment and interviewed people who knew him, trying to find incriminating evidence to lessen the effect of his testimony. A vigorous cross-examination sought to portray Crane as a man of dubious morals; while the prosecution proved that he frequented brothels, Crane claimed this was merely for research purposes. After the trial ended on October 16, the arresting officer was exonerated, and Crane&#x27;s reputation was ruined.

===Cora Taylor and the &quot;Commodore&quot; shipwreck===

Given $700 in Spanish gold by the Bacheller-Johnson syndicate to work as a war correspondent in Cuba as the Spanish–American War was pending, the 25-year-old Crane left New York on November 27, 1896, on a train bound for Jacksonville, Florida. Upon arrival in Jacksonville, he registered at the St. James Hotel under the alias of Samuel Carleton to maintain anonymity while seeking passage to Cuba. He toured the city and visited the local brothels. Within days he met 31-year-old Cora Taylor, proprietor of the downtown bawdy house Hotel de Dream. Born into a respectable Boston family, Taylor (whose legal name was Cora Ethel Stewart) had already had two brief marriages; her first husband, Vinton Murphy, divorced her on grounds of adultery. In 1889, she had married British Captain Donald William Stewart. She left him in 1892 for another man, but was still legally married. By the time Crane arrived, Taylor had been in Jacksonville for two years. She lived a bohemian lifestyle, owned a hotel of assignation, and was a respected local figure. The two spent much time together while Crane awaited his departure. He was finally cleared to leave for the Cuban port of Cienfuegos on New Year&#x27;s Eve aboard the SS &quot;Commodore&quot;.
The ship sailed from Jacksonville with 27 or 28 men and supplies and ammunition for the Cuban rebels. On the St. Johns River and less than from Jacksonville, &quot;Commodore&quot; struck a sandbar in a dense fog and damaged its hull. Although towed off the sandbar the following day, it was beached again in Mayport and again damaged. A leak began in the boiler room that evening and, as a result of malfunctioning water pumps, the ship came to a standstill about from Mosquito Inlet. As the ship took on more water, Crane described the engine room as resembling &quot;a scene at this time taken from the middle kitchen of hades.&quot; The &quot;Commodore&quot;″s lifeboats were lowered early on January 2, 1897, and the ship ultimately sank at 7 a.m. Crane was one of the last to leave in a dinghy. In an ordeal that he recounted in the short story &quot;The Open Boat&quot;, Crane and three other men (including the captain) foundered off the coast of Florida for a day and a half before trying to land the dinghy at Daytona Beach. The small boat overturned in the surf, forcing the exhausted men to swim to shore; one died. Having lost the gold given to him for his journey, Crane wired Cora Taylor for help. She traveled to Daytona and returned to Jacksonville with Crane the next day, only four days after he had left on the &quot;Commodore&quot;.

The disaster was reported on the front pages of newspapers across the country. Rumors that the ship had been sabotaged were widely circulated but never substantiated. Portrayed favorably and heroically by the press, Crane emerged from the ordeal with his reputation enhanced, if not restored. Meanwhile, Crane&#x27;s affair with Taylor blossomed.

Archaeological investigations were conducted in 2002–2004 to examine and document the exposed remains of a wreck near Ponce Inlet, Florida, conjectured to be that of the SS &quot;Commodore&quot;. The collected data, and other accumulated evidence, finally substantiated the identification of the &quot;Commodore&quot;.

===Greco-Turkish War===
Despite contentment in Jacksonville and the need for rest after his ordeal, Crane became restless. He left Jacksonville on January 11 for New York City, where he applied for a passport to Cuba, Mexico and the West Indies. Spending three weeks in New York, he completed &quot;The Open Boat&quot; and periodically visited Port Jervis to see family. By this time, however, blockades had formed along the Florida coast as tensions rose with Spain, and Crane concluded that he would never be able to travel to Cuba. He sold &quot;The Open Boat&quot; to Scribner&#x27;s for $300 in early March. Determined to work as a war correspondent, Crane signed on with William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot; to cover the impending Greco-Turkish conflict. He brought along Taylor, who sold the Hotel de Dream.
On March 20, they sailed first to England, where Crane was warmly received. They arrived in Athens in early April; between April 17 (when Turkey declared war on Greece) and April 22, Crane wrote his first published report of the war, &quot;An Impression of the &#x27;Concert&#x27; &quot;. When he left for Epirus in the northwest, Taylor remained in Athens, where she became the war&#x27;s first woman war correspondent. She wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Imogene Carter&quot; for the &quot;New York Journal&quot;, a job that Crane had secured for her. They wrote frequently, traveling throughout the country separately and together. The first large battle that Crane witnessed was the Turks&#x27; assault on General Constantine Smolenski&#x27;s Greek forces at Velestino. Crane wrote: &quot;It is a great thing to survey the army of the enemy. Just where and how it takes hold upon the heart is difficult of description.&quot; During this battle, Crane encountered &quot;a fat waddling puppy&quot; that he immediately claimed, dubbing it &quot;Velestino, the Journal dog&quot;. Greece and Turkey signed an armistice on May 20; Crane and Taylor left Greece for England, taking with them Velestino and two Greek brothers as servants.

===Spanish–American War===
After staying in Limpsfield, Surrey, for a few days, Crane and Taylor settled in Ravensbrook, a plain brick villa in Oxted. Referring to themselves as Mr. and Mrs. Crane, the couple lived openly in England, but Crane concealed the relationship from friends and family in the United States. Admired in England, Crane thought himself attacked back home: &quot;There seem so many of them in America who want to kill, bury and forget me purely out of unkindness and envy and—my unworthiness, if you choose&quot;, he wrote. Velestino the dog sickened and died soon after their arrival in England, on August 1. Crane, who had a great love for dogs, wrote an emotional letter to a friend an hour after the dog&#x27;s death, stating that &quot;for eleven days we fought death for him, thinking nothing of anything but his life.&quot; The Limpsfield-Oxted area was home to members of the socialist Fabian Society and a magnet for writers such as Edmund Gosse, Ford Madox Ford and Edward Garnett. Crane also met the Polish-born novelist Joseph Conrad in October 1897, with whom he would have what Crane called a &quot;warm and endless friendship&quot;.

Although Crane was confident among peers, strong negative reviews of the recently published &quot;The Third Violet&quot; were causing his literary reputation to dwindle. Reviewers were also highly critical of Crane&#x27;s war letters, deeming them self-centered. Although &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; had by this time gone through fourteen printings in the United States and six in England, Crane was running out of money. To survive financially, he wrote prolifically for both the English and the American markets. He wrote in quick succession stories such as &quot;The Monster&quot;, &quot;The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky&quot;, &quot;Death and the Child&quot; and &quot;The Blue Hotel&quot;. Crane began to attach price tags to his new works of fiction, hoping that &quot;The Bride&quot;, for example, would fetch $175.

As 1897 ended, Crane&#x27;s money crisis worsened. Amy Leslie, a reporter from Chicago and a former lover, sued him for $550. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Leslie gave him $800 in November 1896 but that he had repaid only a quarter. In February, he was summoned to answer Leslie&#x27;s claim. The claim was apparently settled out of court, because no record of adjudication exists. Meanwhile, Crane felt &quot;heavy with troubles&quot; and &quot;chased to the wall&quot; by expenses. He confided to his agent that he was $2,000 in debt but that he would &quot;beat it&quot; with more literary output.

Soon after the exploded in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898, under suspicious circumstances, Crane was offered a £60 advance by &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for articles &quot;from the seat of war in the event of a war breaking out&quot; between the United States and Spain. His health was failing, and it is believed that signs of his pulmonary tuberculosis, which he may have contracted in childhood, became apparent. With almost no money coming in from his finished stories, Crane accepted the assignment and left Oxted for New York. Taylor and the rest of the household stayed behind to fend off local creditors. Crane applied for a passport and left New York for Key West two days before Congress declared war. While the war idled, he interviewed people and produced occasional copy.

In early June, he observed the establishment of an American base in Cuba when Marines seized Guantánamo Bay. He went ashore with the Marines, planning &quot;to gather impressions and write them as the spirit moved.&quot; Although he wrote honestly about his fear in battle, others observed his calmness and composure. He would later recall &quot;this prolonged tragedy of the night&quot; in the war tale &quot;Marines Signaling Under Fire at Guantanamo&quot;. After showing a willingness to serve during fighting at Cuzco, Cuba, by carrying messages to company commanders, Crane was officially cited for his &quot;material aid during the action&quot;.

He continued to report upon various battles and the worsening military conditions and praised Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders, despite past tensions with the Commissioner. In early July, Crane was sent to the United States for medical treatment for a high fever. He was diagnosed with yellow fever, then malaria. Upon arrival in Old Point Comfort, Virginia, he spent a few weeks resting in a hotel. Although Crane had filed more than 20 dispatches in the three months he had covered the war, the &quot;World&quot;&#x27;s business manager believed that the paper had not received its money&#x27;s worth and fired him. In retaliation, Crane signed with Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot; with the wish to return to Cuba. He traveled first to Puerto Rico and then to Havana. In September, rumors began to spread that Crane, who was working anonymously, had either been killed or disappeared. He sporadically sent out dispatches and stories about the mood and conditions in Havana, but he was soon desperate for money again. Taylor, left alone in England, was also penniless. She became frantic with worry over her lover&#x27;s whereabouts; they were not in direct communication until the end of the year. Crane left Havana and arrived in England on January 11, 1899.

===Death===
Rent on Ravensbrook had not been paid for a year. Crane secured a solicitor to act as guarantor for their debts, after which Crane and Taylor relocated to Brede Place. This manor in Sussex, which dated to the 14th century and had neither electricity nor indoor plumbing, was offered to them by friends at a modest rent. The relocation appeared to give Crane hope, but his money problems continued. Deciding that he could no longer afford to write for American publications, he concentrated on publishing in English magazines.

Crane pushed himself to write feverishly during the first months at Brede; he told his publisher that he was &quot;doing more work now than I have at any other period in my life&quot;. His health worsened, and by late 1899 he was asking friends about health resorts. &quot;The Monster and Other Stories&quot; was in production and &quot;War Is Kind&quot;, his second collection of poems, was published in the United States in May. None of his books after &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; had sold well, and he bought a typewriter to spur output. &quot;Active Service&quot;, a novella based on Crane&#x27;s correspondence experience, was published in October. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer questioned &quot;whether the author of &quot;Active Service&quot; himself really sees anything remarkable in his newspapery hero.&quot;
In December, the couple held an elaborate Christmas party at Brede, attended by Conrad, Henry James, H. G. Wells, and other friends; it lasted several days. On December 29 Crane suffered a severe pulmonary hemorrhage. In January 1900, he had recovered sufficiently to work on a new novel, &quot;The O&#x27;Ruddy&quot;, completing 25 of the 33 chapters. Plans were made for him to travel as a correspondent to Gibraltar to write sketches from Saint Helena, the site of a Boer prison, but in late March and early April, he suffered two more hemorrhages. Taylor took over most of Crane&#x27;s correspondence while he was ill, writing to friends for monetary aid. The couple planned to travel on the continent but Conrad, upon visiting Crane for the last time, remarked that his friend&#x27;s &quot;wasted face was enough to tell me that it was the most forlorn of all hopes.&quot;

On May 28, the couple arrived at Badenweiler, Germany, a health spa on the edge of the Black Forest. Despite his weakened condition, Crane continued to dictate fragmentary episodes for the completion of &quot;The O&#x27;Ruddy&quot;. He died on June 5, 1900, at the age of 28. In his will he left everything to Taylor, who took his body to New Jersey for burial. Crane was interred in Evergreen Cemetery in Hillside, New Jersey.

==Fiction and poetry==

===Style and technique===
Stephen Crane&#x27;s fiction is typically categorized as representative of Naturalism, American realism, Impressionism or a mixture of the three. Critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote that the work presents a &quot;symbiosis&quot; of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods. When asked whether he would write an autobiography in 1896, Crane responded that he &quot;dare not say that I am honest. I merely say that I am as nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow.&quot; Similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane&#x27;s writing and Impressionist painting—including the use of color and chiaroscuro—are often cited to support the theory that Crane was not only an Impressionist but also influenced by the movement. H. G. Wells remarked upon &quot;the great influence of the studio&quot; on Crane&#x27;s work, quoting a passage from &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; as an example: &quot;Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night... From this little distance the many fires, with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made weird and satanic effects.&quot; Although no direct evidence exists that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected sentimentality, asserting that &quot;a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character. Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true.&quot;
Poet and biographer John Berryman suggested that there were three basic variations, or &quot;norms&quot;, of Crane&#x27;s narrative style. The first, &quot;flexible, swift, abrupt and nervous&quot;, is best exemplified in &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, while the second (&quot;supple majesty&quot;) is believed to relate to &quot;The Open Boat&quot;, and the third (&quot;much more closed, circumstantial and &#x27;normal&#x27; in feeling and syntax&quot;) to later works such as &quot;The Monster&quot;. Crane&#x27;s work, however, cannot be determined by style solely on chronology. Not only does his fiction not take place in any particular region with similar characters, but it varies from serious in tone to reportorial writing and light fiction. Crane&#x27;s writing, both fiction and nonfiction, is consistently driven by immediacy and is at once concentrated, vivid and intense. The novels and short stories contain poetic characteristics such as shorthand prose, suggestibility, shifts in perspective and ellipses between and within sentences. Similarly, omission plays a large part in Crane&#x27;s work; the names of his protagonists are not commonly used and sometimes they are not named at all.

Crane was often criticized by early reviewers for his frequent incorporation of everyday speech into dialogue, mimicking the regional accents of his characters with colloquial stylization. This is apparent in his first novel, in which Crane ignored the romantic, sentimental approach of slum fiction; he instead concentrated on the cruelty and sordid aspects of poverty, expressed using the Bowery&#x27;s crude dialect and profanity. The distinct dialect of his Bowery characters is apparent at the beginning of the text; the title character admonishes her brother saying: &quot;Yeh knows it puts mudder out when yes comes home half dead, an&#x27; it&#x27;s like we&#x27;ll all get a poundin&#x27;.&quot;

===Major themes===
Crane&#x27;s work is often thematically driven by Naturalistic and Realistic concerns, including ideals versus realities, spiritual crises and fear. These themes are particularly evident in Crane&#x27;s first three novels, &quot;Maggie: A Girl of the Streets&quot;, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; and &quot;George&#x27;s Mother&quot;. The three main characters search for a way to make their dreams come true, but ultimately suffer from crises of identity. Crane was fascinated by war and death, as well as fire, disfigurement, fear and courage, all of which inspired many works. In &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, the main character longs for the heroics of battle but ultimately fears it, demonstrating the dichotomy of courage and cowardice. He experiences the threat of death, misery and a loss of self.

Extreme isolation from society and community is also apparent in Crane&#x27;s work. During the most intense battle scenes in &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, for example, the story&#x27;s focus is mainly &quot;on the inner responses of a self unaware of others&quot;. In &quot;The Open Boat&quot;, &quot;An Experiment in Misery&quot; and other stories, Crane uses light, motion and color to express epistemological uncertainty. Similar to other Naturalistic writers, Crane scrutinizes the position of man, who has been isolated not only from society, but also from God and nature. &quot;The Open Boat&quot;, for example, distances itself from Romantic optimism and affirmation of man&#x27;s place in the world by concentrating on the characters&#x27; isolation.

While he lived, Stephen Crane was denominated by critical readers a realist, a naturalist, an impressionist, symbolist, &quot;Symboliste&quot;, expressionist and ironist; his posthumous life was enriched by critics who read him as nihilistic, existentialist, a neo-Romantic, a sentimentalist, protomodernist, pointilliste, visionist, imagist and, by his most recent biographer, a &quot;bleak naturalist.&quot; At midcentury he was a &quot;predisciple of the New Criticism&quot;; by its end he was &quot;a proto-deconstructionist anti-artist hero&quot; who had &quot;leapfrogged modernism, landing on postmodernist ground.&quot; As Sergio Perosa wrote in 1964, &quot;The critic wanders in a labyrinth of possibilities, which every new turn taken by Crane&#x27;s fiction seems to explode or deny.&quot;

As Anthony Splendora noted in 2015, Death haunts Crane&#x27;s work; it overshadows his best efforts, each of which features the signal demise of a main character. Allegorically, &quot;The Blue Hotel,&quot; at the pinnacle of the short story form, may even be an &quot;autothanatography&quot;, the author&#x27;s intentional exteriorization or objectification, in this case for the purpose of purgation, of his own impending death. Crane&#x27;s &quot;Swede&quot; in that story can be taken, following current psychoanalytical theory, as a surrogative, sacrificial victim.

Transcending this &quot;dark circumstance of composition,&quot; Crane had a particular telos and impetus for his creation: beyond the tautologies that all art is alterity and to some formal extent mimesis, Crane sought and obviously found &quot;a form of catharsis&quot; in writing. This view accounts for his uniqueness, especially as operative through his notorious &quot;disgust&quot; with his family&#x27;s religion, their &quot;vacuous, futile psalm-singing&quot;. His favorite book was Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;, in which God is mentioned only twice—once as irony and once as &quot;a swindle.&quot; Not only did Crane call out God specifically with the lines &quot;Well then I hate thee / righteous image&quot; in &quot;The Black Riders&quot; (1895), but even his most hopeful tropes, such as the &quot;comradeship&quot; of his &quot;Open Boat&quot; survivors, make no mention of deity, specifying only &quot;indifferent nature.&quot; His antitheism is most evident in his characterization of the human race as &quot;lice clinging to a space-lost bulb,&quot; a climax-nearing speech in &quot;The Blue Hotel&quot;. It is possible that Crane utilized religion&#x27;s formal psychic space, now suddenly available resulting from the recent &quot;Death of God&quot;, as a milieu for his compensative art.

===Novels===
Beginning with the publication of &quot;&quot; in 1893, Crane was recognized by critics mainly as a novelist. &quot;Maggie&quot; was initially rejected by publishers because of its atypical and true-to-life depictions of class warfare, which clashed with sentimental tales of that time. Rather than focusing on the rich or middle class, the novel&#x27;s characters are lower-class denizens of New York&#x27;s Bowery. The main character, Maggie, descends into prostitution after being led astray by her lover. Although the novel&#x27;s plot is simple, its dramatic mood, quick pace and portrayal of Bowery life have made it memorable. &quot;Maggie&quot; is not merely an account of slum life, but also represents eternal symbols. In his first draft, Crane did not give his characters proper names. Instead, they were identified by epithets: Maggie, for example, was the girl who &quot;blossomed in a mud-puddle&quot; and Pete, her seducer, was a &quot;knight&quot;. The novel is dominated by irony, anger, and destructive morality. Critics would later call the novel &quot;the first dark flower of American Naturalism&quot; for its distinctive elements of naturalistic fiction.
Written thirty years after the end of the Civil War and before Crane had any experience of battle, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; was innovative stylistically as well as psychologically. Often described as a war novel, it focuses less on battle and more on the main character&#x27;s psyche and his reactions in war. It is believed that Crane based the fictional battle in the novel on that of Chancellorsville; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms, in Port Jervis, New York. Told in a third-person limited point of view, it reflects the private experience of Henry Fleming, a young soldier who flees from combat. &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; is notable in its vivid descriptions and well-cadenced prose, both of which create suspense within the story. Similarly, by substituting epithets for characters&#x27; names (&quot;the youth&quot;, &quot;the tattered soldier&quot;), Crane injects an allegorical quality, making his characters point to a specific characteristic of man. Like Crane&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; has a deeply ironic tone which increases in severity as the novel progresses. The title of the work is ironic; Henry wishes &quot;that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage&quot;. The wound he does receive (from the rifle butt of a fleeing Union soldier) is instead a badge of shame.

The novel expresses a strong connection between humankind and nature, a frequent and prominent concern in Crane&#x27;s fiction and poetry. Whereas contemporary writers (Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau) focused on a sympathetic bond on the two elements, Crane wrote from the perspective that human consciousness distanced humans from nature. In &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, this distance is paired with references to animals, and men with animalistic characteristics: people &quot;howl&quot;, &quot;squawk&quot;, &quot;growl&quot;, or &quot;snarl&quot;.

Since the resurgence of Crane&#x27;s popularity in the 1920s, &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; has been deemed a major American text. The novel has been anthologized numerous times, including in the 1942 collection &quot;Men at War: The Best War Stories of All Time&quot;, edited by Ernest Hemingway. In the introduction, Hemingway wrote that the novel &quot;is one of the finest books of our literature, and I include it entire because it is all as much of a piece as a great poem is.&quot;

Crane&#x27;s later novels have not received as much critical praise. After the success of &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, Crane wrote another tale set in the Bowery. &quot;George&#x27;s Mother&quot; is less allegorical and more personal than his two previous novels, and it focuses on the conflict between a church-going, temperance-adhering woman (thought to be based on Crane&#x27;s mother) and her single remaining offspring, who is a naive dreamer. Critical response to the novel was mixed. &quot;The Third Violet&quot;, a romance that he wrote quickly after publishing &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, is typically considered as Crane&#x27;s attempt to appeal to popular audiences. Crane considered it a &quot;quiet little story.&quot; Although it contained autobiographical details, the characters have been deemed inauthentic and stereotypical. Crane&#x27;s second to last novel, &quot;Active Service&quot;, revolves around the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, with which the author was familiar. Although noted for its satirical take on the melodramatic and highly passionate works that were popular of the nineteenth century, the novel was not successful. It is generally accepted by critics that Crane&#x27;s work suffered at this point due to the speed at which he wrote. His last novel, a suspenseful and picaresque work entitled &quot;The O&#x27;Ruddy&quot;, was finished posthumously by Robert Barr and published in 1903.

===Short fiction===
Crane wrote many different types of fictional pieces while indiscriminately applying to them terms such as &quot;story&quot;, &quot;tale&quot; and &quot;sketch&quot;. For this reason, critics have found clear-cut classification of Crane&#x27;s work problematic. While &quot;The Open Boat&quot; and &quot;The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky&quot; are often considered short stories, others are variously identified.

In an 1896 interview with Herbert P. Williams, a reporter for the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, Crane said that he did &quot;not find that short stories are utterly different in character from other fiction. It seems to me that short stories are the easiest things we write.&quot; During his brief literary career, he wrote more than a hundred short stories and fictional sketches. Crane&#x27;s early fiction was based in camping expeditions in his teens; these stories eventually became known as &quot;The Sullivan County Tales and Sketches&quot;. He considered these &quot;sketches&quot;, which are mostly humorous and not of the same caliber of work as his later fiction, to be &quot;articles of many kinds,&quot; in that they are part fiction and part journalism.

The subject matter for his stories varied extensively. His early New York City sketches and Bowery tales accurately described the results of industrialization, immigration and the growth of cities and their slums. His collection of six short stories &quot;The Little Regiment&quot; covered the American Civil War, a subject for which he became famous with &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;. Although similar to Crane&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Little Regiment&quot; was believed to lack vigor and originality. Realizing the limitations of these tales, Crane wrote: &quot;I have invented the sum of my invention with regard to war and this story keeps me in internal despair.&quot;

&quot;The Open Boat and Other Stories&quot; (1898) contains seventeen short stories that deal with three periods in Crane&#x27;s life: his Asbury Park boyhood, his trip to the West and Mexico in 1895, and his Cuban adventure in 1897. This collection was well received and included several of his most critically successful works. His 1899 collection &quot;The Monster and Other Stories&quot; was similarly well received.

Two posthumously published collections were not as successful. In August 1900 &quot;The Whilomville Stories&quot; were published, a collection of thirteen stories that Crane wrote during the last year of his life. The work deals almost exclusively with boyhood, and the stories are drawn from events occurring in Port Jervis, where Crane lived from the age of six to eleven. Focusing on small-town America, the stories tend toward sentimentality, but remain perceptive of the lives of children. &quot;Wounds in the Rain&quot;, published in September 1900, contains fictional tales based on Crane&#x27;s reports for the &quot;World&quot; and the &quot;Journal&quot; during the Spanish–American War. These stories, which Crane wrote while desperately ill, include &quot;The Price of the Harness&quot; and &quot;The Lone Charge of William B. Perkins&quot; and are dramatic, ironic and sometimes humorous.

Despite Crane&#x27;s prolific output, only four stories—&quot;The Open Boat&quot;, &quot;The Blue Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky&quot;, and &quot;The Monster&quot;—have received extensive attention from scholars. H. G. Wells considered &quot;The Open Boat&quot; to be &quot;beyond all question, the crown of all his work&quot;, and it is one of the most frequently discussed of Crane&#x27;s works.

===Poetry===

Crane&#x27;s poems, which he preferred to call &quot;lines&quot;, are typically not given as much scholarly attention as his fiction; no anthology contained Crane&#x27;s verse until 1926. Although it is not certain when Crane began to write poetry seriously, he once said that his overall poetic aim was &quot;to give my ideas of life as a whole, so far as I know it&quot;. The poetic style used in both of his books of poetry, &quot;The Black Riders and Other Lines&quot; and &quot;War is Kind&quot;, was unconventional for the time in that it was written in free verse without rhyme, meter, or even titles for individual works. They are typically short in length; although several poems, such as &quot;Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind&quot;, use stanzas and refrains, most do not. Crane also differed from his peers and later poets in that his work contains allegory, dialectic and narrative situations.

Critic Ruth Miller claimed that Crane wrote &quot;an intellectual poetry rather than a poetry that evokes feeling, a poetry that stimulates the mind rather than arouses the heart&quot;. In the most complexly organized poems, the significance of the states of mind or feelings is ambiguous, but Crane&#x27;s poems tend to affirm certain elemental attitudes, beliefs, opinions and stances toward God, man and the universe. &quot;The Black Riders&quot; in particular is essentially a dramatic concept and the poems provide continuity within the dramatic structure. There is also a dramatic interplay in which there is frequently a major voice reporting an incident seen or experienced. The second voice or additional voices represent a point of view which is revealed to be inferior; when these clash, a dominant attitude emerges.

==Legacy==

In four years, Crane published five novels, two volumes of poetry, three short story collections, two books of war stories, and numerous works of short fiction and reporting. Today he is mainly remembered for &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;. The novel has been adapted several times for the screen, including John Huston&#x27;s 1951 version. By the time of his death, Crane had become one of the best known writers of his generation. His eccentric lifestyle, frequent newspaper reporting, association with other famous authors, and expatriate status made him somewhat of an international celebrity. Although most stories about his life tended toward the romantic, rumors about his alleged drug use and alcoholism persisted long after his death.

By the early 1920s, Crane and his work were nearly forgotten. It was not until Thomas Beer published his biography in 1923, which was followed by editor Wilson Follett&#x27;s &quot;The Work of Stephen Crane&quot; (1925–1927), that Crane&#x27;s writing came to the attention of a scholarly audience. Crane&#x27;s reputation was then enhanced by writer friends such as Joseph Conrad, H. G. Wells and Ford Madox Ford, all of whom either published recollections or commented upon their time with Crane. John Berryman&#x27;s 1950 biography of Crane further established him as an important American author. Since 1951 there has been a steady outpouring of articles, monographs and reprints in Crane scholarship.

Today, Crane is considered one of the most innovative writers of the 1890s. His peers, including Conrad and James, as well as later writers such as Robert Frost, Ezra Pound and Willa Cather, hailed Crane as one of the finest creative spirits of his time. His work was described by Wells as &quot;the first expression of the opening mind of a new period, or, at least, the early emphatic phase of a new initiative.&quot; Wells said that &quot;beyond dispute&quot;, Crane was &quot;the best writer of our generation, and his untimely death was an irreparable loss to our literature.&quot; Conrad wrote that Crane was an &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;a seer with a gift for rendering the significant on the surface of things and with an incomparable insight into primitive emotions&quot;. Crane&#x27;s work has proved inspirational for future writers; not only have scholars drawn similarities between Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; and &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, but Crane&#x27;s fiction is thought to have been an important inspiration for Hemingway and his fellow Modernists. In 1936, Hemingway wrote in &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; that &quot;The good writers are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and Mark Twain.&quot; Crane&#x27;s poetry is thought to have been a precursor to the Imagist movement, and his short fiction has also influenced American literature. &quot;The Open Boat&quot;, &quot;The Blue Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Monster&quot; and &quot;The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky&quot; are generally considered by critics to be examples of Crane&#x27;s best work.

Badenweiler and the house where he died became a tourist attraction; Alexander Woollcott attested to the fact that, long after Crane&#x27;s death, tourists would be directed to the room where he died. Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library has a collection of Crane and Taylor&#x27;s personal correspondence dating from 1895 to 1908. Near his brother Edmund&#x27;s Sullivan County home in New York, where Crane stayed for a short time, a pond is named after him. The Stephen Crane House in Asbury Park, New Jersey, where the author lived with his siblings for nine years, is operated as a museum dedicated to his life and work. Syracuse University has an annual Stephen Crane Lecture Series.

Columbia University purchased much of the Stephen Crane materials held by Cora Crane at her death. The Crane Collection is one of the largest in the nation of his materials. Columbia University had an exhibit: &quot; &#x27;The Tall Swift Shadow of a Ship at Night&#x27;: Stephen and Cora Crane&quot;, November 2, 1995 through February 16, 1996, about the lives of the couple, featuring letters and other documents and memorabilia.

<text>Newcastle United Football Club is a professional association football club based in Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Since the formation of the club in 1881, when Newcastle East End absorbed the assets of Newcastle West End to become Newcastle United, the club has played its home matches at St James&#x27; Park. Located in the centre of Newcastle, it currently has a capacity of 52,305.

The club has been a member of the Premier League for all but three years of the competition&#x27;s history, spending 92 seasons in the top flight as of May 2024, and has never dropped below English football&#x27;s second tier since joining the Football League in 1893. Newcastle have won four League titles, six FA Cups and an FA Charity Shield, as well as the 1968–69 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the ninth-highest total of trophies won by an English club. The club&#x27;s most successful period was between 1904 and 1910, when they won an FA Cup and three of their League titles. Their last major domestic trophy was in 1955. More recently the club have been League or FA Cup runners-up on four occasions in the 1990s. Newcastle were relegated in 2009, and again in 2016. The club won promotion at the first time of asking each time, returning to the Premier League, as Championship winners, in 2010 and 2017. In October 2021, a consortium led by the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, became majority owners of Newcastle United.

The team&#x27;s traditional kit colours are black-and-white striped shirts, black shorts and black or white socks. Their crest has elements of the city coat of arms, which features two grey hippocamps. Before each home game, the team enters the field to &quot;Going Home&quot;, with &quot;Blaydon Races&quot; also being sung during games. The 2005 film &quot;Goal!&quot; featured Newcastle United, and many signings mentioned the influence the film had on them.

==History==

===1881–1903: formation and early history===
The first record of football being played on Tyneside dates from 3 March 1877 at Elswick Rugby Club. Later that year, Newcastle&#x27;s first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of Byker in November 1881. This team was renamed Newcastle East End F.C. in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in Stanley, County Durham. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, Newcastle West End F.C. formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886 moved into St James&#x27; Park. The two clubs became rivals in the Northern League. In 1889, Newcastle East End became a professional team, before becoming a limited company the following March. Newcastle West End, on the other hand, was in serious financial trouble and approached East End with a view to a takeover. Newcastle West End was eventually dissolved, and a number of its players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End, effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James&#x27; Park in May 1892.

With only one senior club in the city for fans to support, development of the club was much more rapid. Despite being refused entry to the Football League&#x27;s First Division at the start of the 1892–93 season, they were invited to play in their new Second Division. However, with no big names playing in the Second Division, they turned down the offer and remained in the Northern League, stating &quot;gates would not meet the heavy expenses incurred for travelling&quot;. In a bid to start drawing larger crowds, Newcastle East End decided to adopt a new name in recognition of the merger. Suggested names included 1892 Newcastle, Newcastle Rangers, Newcastle City and City of Newcastle, but Newcastle United was decided upon on 9 December 1892, to signify the unification of the two teams. The name change was accepted by the Football Association on 22 December, but the club was not legally constituted as Newcastle United Football Club Co. Ltd. until 6 September 1895. At the start of the 1893–94 season, Newcastle United were once again refused entry to the First Division and so joined the Second Division, along with Liverpool and Woolwich Arsenal. They played their first competitive match in the division that September against Woolwich Arsenal, with a score of 2–2.

Turnstile numbers were still low, and the club published a statement stating, &quot;The Newcastle public do not deserve to be catered for as far as professional football is concerned&quot;. However, eventually figures picked up by 1895–96, when 14,000 fans watched the team play Bury. That season Frank Watt became secretary of the club, and he was instrumental in promotion to the First Division for the 1898–99 season. However, they lost their first game 4–2 at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers and finished their first season in 13th place.

===1903–1937: first glory years and war years===
In 1903–04, the club built up a promising squad of players, and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade, the team known for their &quot;artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing&quot;. Long after his retirement, Peter McWilliam, the team&#x27;s defender at the time, said, &quot;The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and furthermore, beat them at a trot&quot;. Newcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s; 1904–05, 1906–07 and 1908–09. In 1904–05, they nearly did the double, losing to Aston Villa in the 1905 FA Cup Final. They were beaten again the following year by Everton in the 1906 FA Cup Final. They reached the final again in 1908 where they lost to Wolverhampton Wanderers. They finally won the FA Cup in 1910 when they beat Barnsley in the final. They lost again the following year in the final against Bradford City.

The team returned to the FA Cup final in 1924, in the second final held at the then new Wembley Stadium. They beat Aston Villa, winning the club&#x27;s second FA Cup. Three years later, they won the First Division championship a fourth time in 1926–27, with Hughie Gallacher, one of the most prolific goal scorers in the club&#x27;s history, captaining the team. Other key players in this period were Neil Harris, Stan Seymour and Frank Hudspeth. In 1930, Newcastle United came close to relegation, and at the end of the season Gallacher left the club for Chelsea, and at the same time Andy Cunningham became the club&#x27;s first team manager. In 1931–32, the club won the FA Cup a third time. However, a couple of years later, at the end of the 1933–34 season, the team were relegated to the Second Division after 35 seasons in the top. Cunningham left as manager and Tom Mather took over.

===1937–1969: post-war success===
The club found it difficult to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the 1937–38 season, when they were spared on goal average. However, when World War II broke out in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in Jackie Milburn, Tommy Walker and Bobby Cowell. They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the 1947–48 season. During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup three times in five years, beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952 and Manchester City in 1955. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960–61 season under the management of Charlie Mitten. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964–65 season after winning the Second Division title. Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967–68 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 6–2 over two legs against Hungary&#x27;s Újpest in the final.

===1969–1992: bouncing between divisions===
Harvey bought striker Malcolm Macdonald in the summer of 1971, for a club record transfer fee of £180,000 (equivalent to £2,265,000 in 2021). He was an impressive goal scorer, who led United&#x27;s attack to Wembley in their 1974 FA Cup Final defeat at the hands of Liverpool. The club also had back to back triumphs in the Texaco Cup in 1974 and 1975. Harvey left the club in 1975, with Gordon Lee brought in to replace him. Lee took the team to the 1976 Football League Cup Final against Manchester City, but failed to bring the trophy back to Tyneside. However, he sold Macdonald to Arsenal at the end of the season, a decision of which Macdonald later said &quot;I loved Newcastle, until Gordon Lee took over&quot;. Lee left for Everton in 1977, and was replaced by Richard Dinnis.

United dropped once again to the Second Division at the end of the 1977–78 season. Dinnis was replaced by Bill McGarry, and then he was replaced by Arthur Cox. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division at the end of the 1983–84 season, with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle and ex-England captain Kevin Keegan the fulcrum of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for Derby County and Keegan retired. With managers such as Jack Charlton and then Willie McFaul, Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as Waddle, Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne were sold, and the team was relegated once more in the 1988–89 season. McFaul left the managerial post, and was replaced by Jim Smith. Smith left at the start of the 1991–92 season and the board appointed Osvaldo Ardiles his replacement.

John Hall became the club&#x27;s chairman in 1992, and replaced Ardiles with Keegan, who managed to save the team from relegation to the Third Division. Keegan was given more money for players, buying Rob Lee, Paul Bracewell and Barry Venison. The club won the First Division championship at the end of the 1992–93 season, earning promotion to the Premier League.

===1993–2007: into the Premier League===
At the end of their first year, 1993–94 season, back in the top flight they finished in third, their highest league finish since 1927. The attacking philosophy of Keegan led to the team being labelled &quot;The Entertainers&quot; by Sky Sports.

Keegan took Newcastle to two consecutive runners-up finishes in the league in 1995–96 and 1996–97, coming very close to winning the title in the former season which included a 4–3 game against Liverpool at Anfield – often considered the greatest game in Premier League history – which ended with a defining image of the Premier League with Keegan slumped over the advertising hoarding. The success of the team was in part due to the attacking talent of players like David Ginola, Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then world record fee of £15 million.

Keegan left Newcastle in January 1997 and was replaced by Kenny Dalglish, however the club endured a largely unsuccessful season with a 13th-place finish in the 1997–98 FA Premier League, failure to progress beyond the group stages of the 1997–98 UEFA Champions League despite beating Barcelona and group winners Dynamo Kyiv at home as well as coming from 2–0 down to draw 2–2 with Valeriy Lobanovskyi&#x27;s team in Ukraine and defeat in the 1998 FA Cup Final. Dalglish was replaced as manager early in the following season by Ruud Gullit. The club once again finished 13th in the league and lost the 1999 FA Cup Final. Gullit fell into disagreements with the squad and chairman Freddy Shepherd, and quit the club five games into the 1999–2000 season with the team bottom of the table to be replaced by Bobby Robson. In 1999 Newcastle was 5th-highest revenue producing club in the world; second in England behind Manchester United.

A title challenge emerged during the 2001–02 season, and Newcastle&#x27;s fourth-place finish saw them qualify for the UEFA Champions League. The following season, Robson guided the team to another title challenge and finished third in the League, and the second group stage of the Champions League, after being the first team to have progressed past the first group stage after losing their first three games. Newcastle finished fifth in the league at the end of the 2003–04 season, and exited the Champions League in the qualifying rounds, but despite this Robson was sacked in August 2004 following a series of disagreements with the club.

Graeme Souness was brought in as manager early in the 2004–05 season. In his time at the helm, he broke the club&#x27;s transfer record by signing Michael Owen for £16.8 million. Souness also took Newcastle to the quarter-finals of the 2004–05 UEFA Cup with Alan Shearer winning the tournament&#x27;s golden boot as well. However, he was sacked in February 2006 after a bad start to the club&#x27;s 2005–06 season. Glenn Roeder took over, initially on a temporary basis, before being appointed full-time manager at the end of the season. Shearer retired at the end of the 2005–06 season as the club&#x27;s all-time record goal scorer, with 206 goals.

In 2006, Newcastle won the Intertoto Cup for the first time in their history, and their first European trophy since 1973.

Despite finishing the 2005–06 season in seventh, Roeder&#x27;s fortunes changed in the 2006–07 season, with a terrible injury run to the senior squad, and he left the club by mutual consent on 6 May 2007. After the 2006–07 season, and inside the Premier League era, Newcastle United were now the fifth most successful Premiership club in terms of points gained.

Sam Allardyce was appointed Roeder&#x27;s replacement as manager on 15 May 2007.

===2007–2021: Mike Ashley era===
On 7 June, Freddy Shepherd&#x27;s final shares in the club were sold to Mike Ashley and Shepherd was replaced as chairman by Chris Mort on 25 July. Ashley then announced he would be delisting the club from the London Stock Exchange upon completion of the takeover. The club officially ceased trading on the Stock Exchange as of 8am on 18 July 2007 at 5p a share.

Allardyce departed the club on in January 2008 by mutual consent after a bad start to the 2007–08 season, and Kevin Keegan was reappointed as Newcastle manager. Mort stepped down as chairman in June and was replaced by Derek Llambias, a long-term associate of Ashley. Newcastle finished the 2007–08 season in 12th place, but as the season drew to a close, Keegan publicly criticised the board, stating they were not providing the team enough financial support.

In September 2008, Keegan resigned as manager, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s my opinion that a manager must have the right to manage and that clubs should not impose upon any manager any player that he does not want&quot;. Former Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear was appointed as his replacement, but in February 2009, due to his heart surgery, Alan Shearer was appointed interim manager in his absence. Under Shearer, the club were relegated to the Championship at the end of the 2008–09 season, the first time the club had left the Premier League since joining it in 1993.

Following their relegation, the club was put up for sale in June 2009, with an asking price of £100 million. Chris Hughton was given the manager job on a caretaker basis before taking over full-time on 27 October 2009. On the same day, Ashley announced that the club was no longer for sale.

Hughton led Newcastle to win the 2009–10 Championship, securing automatic promotion on 5 April 2010 with five games remaining, and securing the title on 19 April; Newcastle were promoted back to the Premier League after just one season away.

Under Hughton, Newcastle enjoyed a strong start to the 2010–11 season, but he was sacked on 6 December 2010. The club&#x27;s board stated that they felt &quot;an individual with more managerial experience [was] needed to take the club forward.&quot; Three days later, Alan Pardew was appointed as manager with a five-and-a-half-year contract. Despite some turbulence, Newcastle were able to finish 12th at the end of the season, with one particular highlight being a 4–4 home draw against Arsenal that saw Newcastle come back from four goals down to claim a point.

The start of the 2011–12 season was very successful as they went on to enjoy one of their strongest openings to a season, playing 11 consecutive games unbeaten. Newcastle eventually secured a place in the 2012–13 Europa League with a fifth-place finish, their highest league position since the Bobby Robson days. Further honours were to come as Pardew won both the Premier League Manager of the Season and the LMA Manager of the Year awards.

In the following season Newcastle made few acquisitions in the summer and suffered injuries over the season. As a result, the first half of the season was marred by a run of 10 losses in 13 games, which saw the club sink near the relegation zone. The Europa League campaign was largely successful with the team making the quarter-finals before bowing out to eventual finalists Benfica. Domestically, Newcastle struggled, and stayed up after a 2–1 victory over already-relegated Queens Park Rangers on the penultimate game of the season.

The 2014–15 season saw Newcastle fail to win any of their first seven games, prompting fans to start a campaign to get Pardew sacked as manager before an upturn in form saw them climb to fifth in the table. Pardew left for Crystal Palace in December. On 26 January 2015, his assistant John Carver was put in charge for the remainder of the season but came close to relegation, staying up on the final day with a 2–0 home win against West Ham, with Jonás Gutiérrez, who beat testicular cancer earlier in the season, scoring the team&#x27;s second goal.

On 9 June 2015, Carver was sacked and replaced by Steve McClaren the following day. On 11 March 2016, McClaren was sacked after nine months as manager, with Newcastle in 19th place in the Premier League and the club having won just six of 28 Premier League games during his time at the club. He was replaced by Spaniard Rafael Benítez on the same day, who signed a three-year deal, but was not able to prevent the club from being relegated for the second time under Ashley&#x27;s ownership.

Newcastle returned to the Premier League at the first attempt, winning the Championship title in May 2017. In October, Mike Ashley put Newcastle United up for sale for the second time. The team finished the season with a 3–0 win over the previous year&#x27;s champions Chelsea, finishing tenth in the league, their highest finish in four years. The following season saw a 13th-place finish, despite being in the relegation zone in January. Ashley came under increased scrutiny for his lack of investment in the squad and apparent focus on other business ventures. Benitez left his position on 30 June 2019 after rejecting a new contract.

On 17 July 2019, former Sunderland manager Steve Bruce was appointed as manager on a three-year contract. Bruce oversaw 13th and 12th-placed finishes during his two full seasons in charge.

===2021–present: PIF era===
On 7 October 2021, after 14 years as owner, Ashley sold the club to a new consortium for a reported £305 million. The consortium was made up of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund, RB Sports &amp; Media and PCP Capital Partners. On 20 October, Bruce left his position by mutual consent, after receiving a reported £8 million payout. Eddie Howe was appointed as Bruce&#x27;s replacement on 8 November 2021. Howe guided the club to an 11th-place finish after a run of 12 wins in their final 18 games, and Newcastle became the first team in Premier League history to avoid relegation after failing to win any of their first 14 games.

On 21 August 2022, Newcastle United Women moved into the club&#x27;s ownership for the first time, after a formal restructuring. At the end of the 2022–23 season, the club sealed qualification for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years. The season was the subject of the Amazon Prime Video documentary &quot;We Are Newcastle United&quot;. In the 2023–24 season, Newcastle were eliminated in the group stages of the Champions League.

==Club identity==

The club&#x27;s home colours are a black and white striped shirt. Shorts and socks are usually black with white trim, though white socks are sometimes worn. Newcastle&#x27;s colours at the outset were generally the home kit of Newcastle East End, comprising plain red shirts with white shorts and red socks. In 1894, the club adopted the black and white striped shirts, which had been used as the reserve team&#x27;s colours. These colours were chosen for the senior team because they were not associated with either of the two teams United were merged from. They played in grey shorts until 1897, and between 1897 and 1921, they played in blue shorts before adopting the black shorts they play in now.

United&#x27;s away colours have changed a number of times over the years. They played in white shirts and black shorts from 1914 until 1961, and then white shorts until 1966. They then played in yellow shirts and blue shorts for the 1967–68 season, but from 1969 to 1974 played in all red with an all blue third kit. In 1974, they returned to a yellow shirt, which they played with various coloured shorts until 1983. They played in all grey from 1983 to 1988, before once again returning to the yellow kit until 1993. Since 1995, the away kit has changed frequently and has not been the same for more than a single season.

The current club crest was first used in the 1988–89 season. The crest includes elements from the coat of arms of the city of Newcastle upon Tynethe two sea horses representing Tyneside&#x27;s strong connections with the sea, the castle representing the city&#x27;s keep. The city&#x27;s coat of arms were first embroidered on the team&#x27;s shirts in 1969 and worn as standard until 1976. A scroll at the bottom featured the city&#x27;s motto in Latin; &quot;fortiter defendit triumphans&quot; which translates into English as &quot;triumphing by brave defence&quot;. From 1976 until 1983, the club wore a specific badge which was developed to wear in place of the city&#x27;s coat of arms. The design was of a circular shape, which featured the club&#x27;s name in full, it contained a magpie standing in front of the River Tyne with the historic keep of Newcastle in the background. A more simplistic design followed in 1983, featuring the initials of the club&#x27;s name, NUFC with the small magpie used in the previous crest within the horizontally laid &quot;C,&quot;; this logo was relatively short lived and was discontinued after 1988.

===Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors===

In May 2013, Newcastle announced a sponsorship which featured the Wonga.com logo on kits. This attracted criticism from many Newcastle supporters. In July 2013, it was reported that Newcastle striker and practising Muslim Papiss Cissé refused to wear any official kit or training wear with reference to Wonga.com as it did not align with his religious beliefs. The matter was later resolved.

On 15 May 2017, the home shirt for the 2017–18 season was revealed, featuring the logo of new sponsors Fun88. The shirt was shown to include a gold and silver commemorative crest to mark the club&#x27;s 125th football season, based on the city&#x27;s coat of arms. It was also announced that the kit would feature red numbers for the first time since the 1992–93 season.

Newcastle United&#x27;s current kit sponsor is Sela, a deal that started in 2023. Previous kit sponsors include Newcastle Breweries (1980–1986), Greenall&#x27;s Beers (1986–1990), McEwan&#x27;s Lager and Newcastle Brown Ale (1990–2000), NTL (2000–2003), Northern Rock (2003–2012), Virgin Money (2012–2013), Wonga.com (2013–2017), and Fun88 (2017–2023).

Newcastle United&#x27;s current kit manufacturer is Adidas, in a deal that started in 2024. Previous kit manufacturers include Bukta (1974–1975, 1976–1980), Umbro (1975–1976, 1980–1993), Asics (1993–1995), Adidas (1995–2010, 2024–present), Puma (2010–2021), and Castore (2021–2024).

<text>CIA cryptonyms are code names or code words used by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to refer to projects, operations, persons, agencies, etc.

==Format of cryptonyms==
CIA cryptonyms sometimes contain a two character prefix called a digraph, which designates a geographical or functional area. Certain digraphs were changed over time; for example, the digraph for the Soviet Union changed at least twice.

The rest is either an arbitrary dictionary word, or occasionally the digraph and the cryptonym combine to form a dictionary word (e.g., AEROPLANE) or can be read out as a simple phrase (e.g., WIBOTHER, read as &quot;Why bother!&quot;). Cryptonyms are sometimes written with a slash after the digraph, e.g., ZR/RIFLE, and sometimes in one sequence, e.g., ZRRIFLE. The latter format is the more common style in CIA documents.

Examples from publications by former CIA personnel show that the terms &quot;code name&quot; and &quot;cryptonym&quot; can refer to the names of operations as well as to individual persons. TRIGON, for example, was the code name for Aleksandr Ogorodnik, a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the former Soviet Union, whom the CIA developed as a spy; HERO was the code name for Col. Oleg Penkovsky, who supplied data on the nuclear readiness of the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. According to former CIA Director Richard M. Helms: &quot;The code names for most Agency operations are picked in sequence from a sterile list, with care taken not to use any word that might give a clue to the activity it covers. On some large projects, code names are occasionally specially chosen—GOLD, SILVER, PBSUCCESS, CORONA. When Robert F. Kennedy requested a code name for the government-wide plan that Richard Goodwin was drafting, an exception was made. Goodwin was on the White House staff, and the plan concerned Cuba. Occasionally the special code names come close to the nerve, as did MONGOOSE.&quot; A secret joint program between the Mexico City CIA station and the Mexican secret police to wiretap the Soviet and Cuban embassies was code-named ENVOY.

Some cryptonyms relate to more than one subject, e.g., a group of people. In this case, the basic cryptonym, e.g., LICOZY, will designate the whole group, while each group member is designated by a sequence number, e.g., LICOZY/3, which can also be written LICOZY-3, or just L-3.

<doc id="57805" wikidata="Q494569" url="?curid=57805" title="Nez Perce County, Idaho">
<text>Nez Perce County ; is a county located in the U.S. state of Idaho. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 42,090. The county seat is Lewiston. The county is named after the Native American Nez Perce tribe. Nez Perce County is part of the Lewiston, Idaho–WA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Nez Perce County was originally organized in 1861, when the area was part of Washington Territory. It was reorganized in 1864 by the Idaho Territorial Legislature and was later subdivided into new counties. Rapid migration to the Palouse in the 1880s led to the formation of Latah County in 1888. Isolated from its county seat of Wallace in the Silver Valley, the southern portion of Shoshone County was annexed by Nez Perce County in 1904, then became Clearwater County in 1911. Lewis County was also formed from Nez Perce County in 1911.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water.

Nez Perce County has two rivers, the Clearwater and the Snake, which meet in Lewiston and then flow west. The Clearwater flows from the east and the Snake from the south, creating the state border with Washington (and further upstream, Oregon). The lowest point in the state of Idaho is located on the Snake River in Lewiston in Nez Perce County, where it flows out of Idaho and into Washington.

The northern portion of the county is part of the Palouse, a wide and rolling agricultural region of the middle Columbia basin.

==Government and politics==
Nez Perce County is currently strongly Republican, though less so than southern Idaho: it is one of only nine counties (out of 44) in Idaho that has failed to vote Republican in every presidential election since 1968, and indeed supported Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton (by plurality) three times in succession from 1988 to 1996.

In 2004 Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry 62% to 36%. In 2008 Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama by a slightly smaller margin of 58.11 percent to 39.97 percent, a result almost exactly replicated by Mitt Romney in 2012. In 2016 Donald Trump increased the Republican majority to 62.2 percent as against Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 28.1 percent.

<doc id="57808" wikidata="Q213510" url="?curid=57808" title="Belgian Congo">
<text>The Belgian Congo (, ; ) was a Belgian colony in Central Africa from 1908 until independence in 1960 and became the Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville). The former colony adopted its present name, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), in 1964.

Colonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century. King Leopold II of the Belgians attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexploited Congo Basin. Their ambivalence resulted in Leopold establishing a colony himself. With support from a number of Western countries, Leopold achieved international recognition of the Congo Free State in 1885. By the turn of the century, the violence used by Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and a ruthless system of economic exploitation led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did by creating the Belgian Congo in 1908.

Belgian rule in the Congo was based on the &quot;colonial trinity&quot; (&quot;trinité coloniale&quot;) of state, missionary and private-company interests. The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised. On many occasions, the interests of the government and of private enterprise became closely linked, and the state helped companies to break strikes and to remove other barriers raised by the indigenous population. The colony was divided into hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions and run uniformly according to a set &quot;native policy&quot; (&quot;politique indigène&quot;). This differed from the practice of British and French colonial policy, which generally favoured systems of indirect rule, retaining traditional leaders in positions of authority under colonial oversight.

During the 1940s and 1950s, the Belgian Congo experienced extensive urbanisation and the colonial administration began various development programs aimed at making the territory into a &quot;model colony&quot;. One result saw the development of a new middle-class of Europeanised African &quot;évolués&quot; in the cities. By the 1950s, the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony.

In 1960, as the result of a widespread and increasingly radical pro-independence movement, the Belgian Congo achieved independence, becoming the Republic of the Congo under Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu. Poor relations between political factions within the Congo, the continued involvement of Belgium in Congolese affairs, and the intervention by major parties (mainly the United States and the Soviet Union) during the Cold War led to a five-year-long period of war and political instability, known as the Congo Crisis, from 1960 to 1965. This ended with the seizure of power by Joseph-Désiré Mobutu in November 1964.

==Congo Free State==

Until the later part of the 19th century, few Europeans had ventured into the Congo Basin. The rainforest, swamps and accompanying malaria and other tropical diseases, such as sleeping sickness, made it a difficult environment for European exploration and exploitation. In 1876, King Leopold II of Belgium organized the International African Association with the cooperation of the leading African explorers and the support of several European governments for the promotion of the exploration and colonization of Africa. After Henry Morton Stanley had explored the region in a journey that ended in 1878, Leopold courted the explorer and hired him to help his interests in the region.

Leopold II had been keen to acquire a colony for Belgium even before he ascended to the throne in 1865. The Belgian civil government showed little interest in its monarch&#x27;s dreams of empire-building. Ambitious and stubborn, Leopold decided to pursue the matter on his own account.

European rivalry in Central Africa led to diplomatic tensions, in particular with regard to the Congo Basin, which no European power had claimed. In November 1884, Otto von Bismarck convened a 14-nation conference (the Berlin Conference) to find a peaceful resolution to the Congo situation. Though the Berlin Conference did not formally approve the territorial claims of the European powers in Central Africa, it did agree on a set of rules to ensure a conflict-free partitioning of the region. The rules recognised (&quot;inter alia&quot;) the Congo Basin as a free-trade zone. But Leopold II emerged triumphant from the Berlin Conference and his single shareholder &quot;philanthropic&quot; organization received a large share of territory () to be organized as the Congo Free State.

The Congo Free State operated as a corporate state, privately controlled by Leopold II through a non-governmental organization, the International African Association. The state included the entire area of the present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, and existed from 1885 until 1908, when the government of Belgium reluctantly annexed the area. Under Leopold II&#x27;s administration, the Congo Free State became a humanitarian disaster. The lack of accurate records makes it difficult to quantify the number of deaths caused by the ruthless exploitation and the lack of immunity to new diseases introduced by contact with European colonists – like the 1889–1890 influenza pandemic, which caused millions of deaths on the European continent, including Prince Baudouin of Belgium, who died in 1891. William Rubinstein wrote: &quot;More basically, it appears almost certain that the population figures given by Hochschild are inaccurate. There is, of course, no way of ascertaining the population of the Congo before the twentieth century and estimates like 20 million are purely guesses. Most of the interior of the Congo was literally unexplored if not inaccessible.&quot; Leopold&#x27;s &quot;Force Publique,&quot; a private army that terrorized natives to work as forced labour for resource extraction, disrupted local societies and killed and abused natives indiscriminately. The &quot;Force Publique&quot; also became involved in the Congo–Arab War against African and Arab slavers like Zanzibari/Swahili strongman Tippu Tip.

Following the 1904 Casement Report on misdeeds and conditions, European (British included) and American press exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in the early 1900s. In 1904 Leopold II was forced to allow an international parliamentary commission of inquiry entry to the Congo Free State. By 1908, public pressure and diplomatic manoeuvres led to the end of Leopold II&#x27;s personal rule and to the annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium, known as the &quot;Belgian Congo&quot;.

==Belgian Congo==

On 18 October 1908, the Belgian Parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian colony. A majority of the socialists and the radicals firmly opposed this annexation and reaped electoral benefits from their anti-colonialist campaign, but some believed that the country should annex the Congo and play a humanitarian role to the Congolese population. Eventually, two Catholic MPs and half of the Liberal MPs joined the socialists in rejecting the Colonial Charter (forty-eight votes against) and nearly all the Catholics and the other half of the Liberal MP&#x27;s approved the charter (ninety votes for and seven abstentions). This way, on 15 November 1908 the Belgian Congo became a colony of the Belgian Kingdom. This was after King Leopold II had given up any hope of excluding a vast region of the Congo from the government&#x27;s control by attempting to maintain a substantial part of the Congo Free State as a separate crown property.

When the Belgian government took over the administration in 1908, the situation in the Congo improved in certain respects. The brutal exploitation and arbitrary use of violence, in which some of the concessionary companies had excelled, were curbed. The crime of &quot;red rubber&quot; was put to a stop. Article 3 of the new Colonial Charter of 18 October 1908 stated that: &quot;Nobody can be forced to work on behalf of and for the profit of companies or privates&quot;, but this was not enforced, and the Belgian government continued to impose forced labour on the indigenous people of the area, albeit by less obvious methods.

The transition from the Congo Free State to the Belgian Congo was a turning point, but it was also marked by a considerable continuity. The last Governor-General of the Congo Free State, Baron Wahis, remained in office in the Belgian Congo, and the majority of Leopold II&#x27;s administration with him. While conditions were improved somewhat relative to rule under King Leopold, reports by doctors such as Dr. Raingeard show the low importance the Belgian government placed on healthcare and basic education of the natives. Opening up the Congo and its natural and mineral riches for the Belgian economy remained the motive for colonial expansion.
===Government===
The governance of the Belgian Congo was outlined in the 1908 Colonial Charter. Executive power rested with the Belgian Minister of Colonial Affairs, assisted by a Colonial Council (&quot;Conseil Colonial&quot;). Both resided in Brussels. The Belgian Parliament exercised legislative authority over the Belgian Congo.
The highest-ranking representative of the colonial administration residing in the Belgian Congo was the Governor-General. From 1886 until 1926, the Governor-General and his administration were posted in Boma, near the Congo River estuary. From 1923, the colonial capital moved to Léopoldville, some 300 km further upstream in the interior. Initially, the Belgian Congo was administratively divided into four provinces: Congo-Kasaï, Equateur, Orientale, and Katanga, each presided over by a Vice-Governor-General. An administrative reform in 1932 increased the number of provinces to six, while &quot;demoting&quot; the Vice-Governors-General to provincial Governors.
The territorial service was the true backbone of the colonial administration. The colony was divided into four provinces (six after the administrative reforms of 1933). Each province was in turn divided into a few districts (24 districts for the whole Congo) and each district into a handful of territories (some 130–150 territories in all; some territories were merged or split over time). A territory was managed by a territorial administrator, assisted by one or more assistants. The territories were further subdivided into numerous &quot;chiefdoms&quot; (&quot;chefferies&quot;), at the head of which the Belgian administration appointed &quot;traditional chiefs&quot; (&quot;chefs coutumiers&quot;). The territories administered by one territorial administrator and a handful of assistants were often larger than a few Belgian provinces taken together (the whole Belgian Congo was nearly 80 times larger than the whole of Belgium and was roughly twice the size of Germany and France combined). The territorial administrator was expected to inspect his territory and to file detailed annual reports with the provincial administration.

In terms of the legal system, two systems co-existed: a system of European courts and one of indigenous courts (&quot;tribunaux indigènes&quot;). These indigenous courts were presided over by the traditional chiefs but had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration. In 1936 it was recorded that there were 728 administrators controlling the Congo from Belgium. Belgians living in the Congo had no say in the government and the Congolese did not either. No political activity was permitted in the Congo whatsoever. Public order in the colony was maintained by the &quot;Force Publique&quot;, a locally recruited army under Belgian command. It was only in the 1950s that metropolitan troops—i.e., units of the regular Belgian army—were posted in the Belgian Congo (for instance in Kamina).

The colonial state—and any authority exercised by whites in the Congo—was often referred to by the Congolese as &quot;bula matari&quot; (&quot;break rocks&quot;), one of the names originally given to Stanley. He had used dynamite to crush rocks when paving his way through the lower-Congo region. The term &quot;bula matari&quot; came to signify the irresistible and compelling force of the colonial state.

===International conflicts===

The Belgian Congo was directly involved in the two world wars. During World War I, an initial stand-off between the &quot;Force Publique&quot; and the German colonial army in German East Africa (Tanganyika) turned into open warfare with a joint Anglo-Belgian invasion of German colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the East African campaign. By 1916, the Belgian commander of the &quot;Force Publique&quot;, Lieutenant-General Charles Tombeur, had assembled an army of 15,000 men supported by local bearers – Reybrouck indicated that during the war no less than 260,000 native bearers were called upon – and advanced to Kigali (now the capital of Rwanda). Kigali was taken by 6 May 1916, and the army went on to take Tabora (now part of Tanzania) on 19 September after heavy fighting. In 1917, after Mahenge (now in Tanzania) had been conquered, the army of the Belgian Congo, by now 25,000 men, occupied one-third of German East Africa.

After World War I, under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany ceded control of the western section of the former German East Africa to Belgium, and Ruanda-Urundi would go on to become a League of Nations mandate territory, under Belgian administration. These areas did not become part of the Belgian Congo. Ruanda-Urundi would later become independent as the nations of Rwanda and Burundi, and the Belgian-controlled portions of German East Africa would join the nation of Tanganyika, followed by Tanzania.

During World War II, the Belgian Congo served as a crucial source of income for the Belgian government in exile in London after the occupation of Belgium by the Nazis. Following the occupation of Belgium by the Germans in May 1940, the Belgian Congo declared itself loyal to the Belgian government in exile in London. The Belgian Congo and the rest of the Free Belgian forces supported the war on the Allied side in the Battle of Britain with 28 pilots in the RAF (squadron 349) and in the Royal South African Air Force (350 Squadron) and in Africa. The &quot;Force Publique&quot; again participated in the Allied campaigns in Africa. Belgian Congolese forces (with Belgian officers) notably fought against the Italian colonial army in Italian East Africa, and were victorious in Asosa, Bortaï and in the Siege of Saïo under Major-general Auguste-Eduard Gilliaert during the second East African campaign of 1940–1941. On 3 July 1941, the Italian forces (under General Pietro Gazzera) surrendered when they were cut off by the &quot;Force Publique&quot;. A Congolese unit also served in the Far Eastern Theatre with the British army in the Burma campaign.

==Economic policy==
The economic exploitation of the Congo was one of the colonizer&#x27;s top priorities. An important tool was the construction of railways to open up the mineral and agricultural areas.
===World War I===

Rubber had long been the main export of the Belgian Congo, but its importance fell in the early 20th century from 77% of exports (by value) to only 15% as British colonies in Southeast Asia like British Malaya began to farm rubber. New resources were exploited, especially copper mining in Katanga province. The Belgian-owned Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, which would come to dominate copper mining, used a direct rail line to the sea at Beira. World War I increased demand for copper, and production soared from 997 tons in 1911 to 27,462 tons in 1917, then fell off to 19,000 tons in 1920. Smelters operated at Lubumbashi. Before the war the copper was sold to Germany; but the British purchased all the wartime output, with the revenues going to the Belgian government in exile. Diamond- and gold-mining also expanded during the war. The British firm of Lever Bros. greatly expanded the palm oil business during the war, and output of cocoa, rice and cotton increased. New rail and steamship lines opened to handle the expanded export traffic. During the First World War (1914–1918), the system of &quot;mandatory cultivation&quot; (&quot;cultures obligatoires&quot;) was introduced, forcing Congolese peasants to grow certain cash crops (cotton, coffee, groundnuts) destined as commodities for export. Territorial administrators and state agronomists had the task of supervising and, if necessary, sanctioning those peasants who evaded the hated mandatory cultivation.

===Interbellum===
Two distinct periods of investment in the Congo&#x27;s economic infrastructure stand out during the period of Belgian rule: the 1920s and the 1950s.
In 1921, the Belgian government provided 300 million francs of loans to the Belgian Congo, to fund public infrastructure projects in support of the boom of the private companies in the colony. The Belgian government also privatised many of the government-owned companies that were active in the colony (the Kilo-Moto mines, La Société Nationale des transport fluviaux..). After the First World War, priority was given to investments in transport infrastructure (such as the rail lines between Matadi and Léopoldville and Elisabethville and Port Francqui). From 1920 to 1932, 2,450 km of railroads were constructed. The government also invested heavily in harbour infrastructure in the cities of Boma, Matadi, Leopoldville and Coquilhatville. Electricity and waterworks in the main cities were also funded. Airports were built and a telephone line was funded that connected Brussels with Leopoldville. The government accounted for about 50% of the investments in the Belgian Congo; commercial companies accounted for the other 50%. The mining industry—with the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (U.M.H.K.) as a major player—, attracted the majority of private investments (copper and cobalt in Katanga, diamonds in Kasai, gold in Ituri). This allowed, in particular, the Belgian Société Générale to build up an economic empire in the Belgian Congo. Huge profits were generated by the private companies and for a large part siphoned off to European and other international shareholders in the form of dividends.
During the economic boom of the 1920s, many young Congolese men left their often impoverished rural villages and were employed by companies located near the cities; the population of Kinshasa nearly doubled from 1920 to 1940, and the population of Elizabethville grew from approximately 16,000 in 1923, to 33,000 in 1929. The necessary work-force was recruited by specialised recruiting firms (Robert Williams &amp; Co, Bourse du Travail Kasaï..) and was in some cases supported by governmental recruiting offices (Office de Travail-Offitra..). In Katanga the main labour force were seasonal migrant workers from Tanganyika, Angola, Northern Rhodesia, and after 1926, also from Ruanda-Urundi.

In many cases, this huge labour migration affected the economic viability of rural communities: many farmers left their villages, which resulted in labour shortages in these areas. To counter these problems, the colonial government used maximum quotas of &quot;able-bodied workers&quot; that could be recruited from every area in the Belgian Congo. In this way, tens of thousands of workers from densely populated areas were employed in copper mines in the sparsely populated south (Katanga). In agriculture, too, the colonial state forced a drastic rationalisation of production. The state took over so-called &quot;vacant lands&quot; (land not directly used by the local population) and redistributed the territory to European companies, to individual white landowners (&quot;colons&quot;), or to the missions. In this way, an extensive plantation economy developed. Palm-oil production in the Congo increased from 2,500 tons in 1914 to 9,000 tons in 1921, and to 230,000 tons in 1957. Cotton production increased from 23,000 tons in 1932 to 127,000 in 1939.

The mobilization of the African workforce in the capitalist colonial economy played a crucial role in spreading the use of money in the Belgian Congo. The basic idea was that the development of the Congo had to be borne not by the Belgian taxpayers but by the Congolese themselves. The colonial state needed to be able to levy taxes in money on the Congolese, so it was important that they could make money by selling their produce or their labour within the framework of the colonial economy.
The economic boom of the 1920s turned the Belgian Congo into one of the leading copper-ore producers worldwide. In 1926 alone, the Union Minière exported more than 80,000 tons of copper ore, a large part of it for processing in Hoboken (Belgium). In 1928 King Albert I visited the Congo to inaugurate the so-called &#x27;voie national&#x27; that linked the Katanga mining region via rail (up to Port Francqui) and via river transport (from Port Francqui to Léopoldville) to the Atlantic port of Matadi.

===Great Depression===
The Great Depression of the 1930s affected the export-based Belgian Congo economy severely because of the drop in international demand for raw materials and agricultural products (for example, the price of peanuts fell from 1.25 francs to 25 centimes (cents)). In some areas, as in the Katanga mining region, employment declined by 70%. In the country as a whole, the wage labour force decreased by 72,000 and many such labourers returned to their villages. In Leopoldville, the population decreased by 33%, because of this labour migration. In order to improve conditions in the countryside, the colonial government developed the so-called &quot;indigenous peasantry programme&quot;, aimed at supporting the development of a stronger internal market that was less dependent of fluctuations in export demand, but also to combat the disastrous effects of erosion and soil exhaustion brought about by the mandatory cultivation scheme. This policy began to be implemented on a large scale throughout the Congo after the Second World War, by the colonial government. The scheme aimed to modernize indigenous agriculture by assigning plots of land to individual families and by providing them with government support in the form of selected seeds, agronomic advice, fertilizers, etc. The National Institute for Agronomic Study of the Belgian Congo, established in 1934, with its large experimental fields and laboratories in Yangambe, played an important role in crop selection and in the popularization of agronomic research and know-how.

===World War II===
During World War II, industrial production and agricultural output increased drastically. The Congolese population bore the brunt of the &quot;war effort&quot; – for instance, through a reinforcement of the mandatory cultivation policy. After Malaya fell to the Japanese (January 1942), the Belgian Congo became a strategic supplier of rubber to the Allies. The Belgian Congo became one of the major exporters of uranium to the US during World War II (and the Cold War), particularly from the Shinkolobwe mine. The colony provided the uranium used by the Manhattan Project, including in atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

===Post World War II===

After World War II, the colonial state became more active in the economic and social development of the Belgian Congo. An ambitious ten-year plan was launched by the Belgian government in 1949. It put emphasis on house building, energy supply, rural development and health-care infrastructure. The ten-year plan ushered in a decade of strong economic growth, from which, for the first time, the Congolese began to benefit on a substantial scale. At the same time, the economy had expanded and the number of Belgian nationals in the country more than doubled, from 39,000 in 1950 to more than 88,000 by 1960.

In 1953, Belgium granted the Congolese the right – for the first time – to buy and sell private property in their own names. In the 1950s a Congolese middle class, modest at first, but steadily growing, emerged in the main cities (Léopoldville, Elisabethville, Stanleyville, and Luluabourg).

There was rapid political development, forced by African aspirations, in the last years of the 1950s, culminating in the 1960 Belgian Congo general election.

==Civilising mission==

Justifications for colonialism in Africa, taking as a given that tribal wars, cannibalism, human sacrifice, display of human trophies, bigamy, and other &quot;primitive&quot; practices were common place, often invoked as a key argument the civilizing influence of the European culture. The civilizing mission in the Congo went hand-in-hand with the economic and educational development. Conversion to Catholicism, basic Western-style education, and improved health-care were objectives in their own right, but at the same time helped to transform what Europeans regarded as a primitive society into the Western capitalist model, in which workers who were disciplined and healthy, and who had learned to read and write, could be assimilated into labour market. Some of the first notable missions into Africa were conducted by David Livingstone and John M. Springer during the late 19th century into the early 20th century.

===Education===

The educational system was dominated by the Catholic Church—as was the case for the rest of Belgium at the time—and, in some rare cases, by Protestant churches. Curricula reflected Christian and Western values. Even in 1948, 99.6% of educational facilities were run by Christian missions. Indigenous schooling was mainly religious and vocational. Children received basic education such as learning how to read, write and some mathematics. The Belgian Congo was one of the few African colonies in which local languages (Kikongo, Lingala, Tshiluba and Swahili) were taught at primary school. Even so, language policies and colonial domination often went hand in hand, as evidenced by the preference given to Lingala—a semi-artificial language spread through its common use in the &quot;Force Publique&quot;—over more local (but also more ancient) indigenous languages such as Lomongo and others.
In 1940 the schooling rates of children between 6 and 14 years old was 12%, reaching 37% in 1954, one of the highest rates in sub-Saharan Africa. Secondary and higher education for the indigenous population were not developed until relatively late in the colonial period. Black children, in small numbers, began to be admitted to European secondary schools from 1950 onward. The first university in the Belgian Congo, the Catholic Jesuit Lovanium University, near Léopoldville, opened its doors to black and white students in 1954. Before the foundation of the Lovanium, the Catholic University of Louvain already operated multiple institutes for higher education in the Belgian Congo. The &quot;Fomulac&quot; (Fondation médicale de l&#x27;université de Louvain au Congo), was founded in 1926, with the goal of forming Congolese medical personnel and researchers specialized in tropical medicine. In 1932 the Catholic University of Louvain founded the &quot;Cadulac&quot; (Centres agronomiques de l&#x27;université de Louvain au Congo) in Kisantu. Cadulac was specialized in agricultural sciences and formed the basis for what was later to become Lovanium University. In 1956 a state university was founded in Elisabethville. Progress was slow though; until the end of the 1950s, no Congolese had been promoted beyond the rank of non-commissioned officer in the Force Publique, nor to a responsible position in the administration (such as head of bureau or territorial administrator).

In the late 1950s, 42% of the youth of school-going age was literate, which placed the Belgian Congo far ahead of any other country in Africa at the time. In 1960, 1,773,340 students were enrolled in schools around the Belgian Congo, of which 1,650,117 in primary school, 22,780 in post-primary school, 37,388 in secondary school and 1,445 in university and higher education. Of these 1,773,340 students, the majority (1,359,118) were enrolled in Catholic mission schools, 322,289 in Protestant mission schools and 68,729 in educational institutions organized by the state.

===Health care===

Health care, too, was largely supported by the missions, although the colonial state took an increasing interest. In 1906 the Institute of Tropical Medicine was founded in Brussels. The ITM was, and still is, one of the world&#x27;s leading institutes for training and research in tropical medicine and the organisation of health care in developing countries. Endemic diseases, such as sleeping sickness, were all but eliminated through large-scale and persistent campaigns.
In 1925 medical missionary Dr. Arthur Lewis Piper was the first person to use and bring tryparsamide, the Rockefeller Foundation&#x27;s drug to cure sleeping sickness, to the Congo. The health-care infrastructure expanded steadily throughout the colonial period, with a comparatively high availability of hospital beds relative to the population and with dispensaries set up in the most remote regions. In 1960 the country had a medical infrastructure that far surpassed any other African nation at that time. The Belgian Congo had 3,000 health care facilities, of which 380 were hospitals. There were 5.34 hospital beds for every 1000 inhabitants (1 for every 187 inhabitants). Great progress was also made in the fight against endemic diseases; the numbers of reported cases of sleeping sickness went from 34,000 cases in 1931 to 1,100 cases in 1959, mainly by eradicating the tsetse fly in densely populated areas. All Europeans and Congolese in the Belgian Congo received vaccinations for polio, measles and yellow fever. Vast disease prevention programmes were rolled out, aimed at eradicating polio, leprosy and tuberculosis. In the primary schools, disease prevention campaigns were implemented, and disease prevention classes were part of the curriculum.

===Social inequality and racial discrimination===

There was an &quot;implicit apartheid&quot;. The colony had curfews for Congolese city-dwellers and similar racial restrictions were commonplace. Léopoldville&#x27;s system of racist curfews was particularly notable and was used as a blueprint in other European colonies, such as nearby French Equatorial Africa. Though there were no specific laws imposing racial segregation and barring blacks from establishments frequented by whites, &quot;de facto&quot; segregation operated in most areas. For example, initially, the city centers were reserved to the white population only, while the black population was organized in &quot;cités indigènes&quot; (indigenous neighbourhoods called &#x27;le belge&#x27;). Hospitals, department stores and other facilities were often reserved for either whites or blacks. In the Force Publique, black people could not pass the rank of non-commissioned officer. The black population in the cities could not leave their houses from 9 pm to 4 am. This type of segregation began to disappear gradually only in the 1950s, but even then the Congolese remained or felt treated in many respects as second-rate citizens (for instance in political and legal terms).
Because of the close interconnection between economic development and the &#x27;civilizing mission&#x27;, and because in practice state officials, missionaries and the executives of the private companies always lent each other a helping hand, the image has emerged that the Belgian Congo was governed by a &quot;colonial trinity&quot; of King-Church-Capital, encompassing the colonial state, the Christian missions, and the Société Générale de Belgique.

The paternalistic ideology underpinning colonial policy was summed up in a catchphrase used by Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans (1934–46): &quot;Dominer pour servir&quot; (&quot;Dominate to serve&quot;). The colonial government wanted to convey images of a benevolent and conflict-free administration and of the Belgian Congo as a true model colony. Only in the 1950s did this paternalistic attitude begin to change. In the 1950s the most blatant discriminatory measures directed at the Congolese were gradually withdrawn (among these: corporal punishment by means of the feared chicote—Portuguese word for whip). From 1953, and even more so after the triumphant visit of King Baudouin to the colony in 1955, Governor-General Léon Pétillon (1952–1958) worked to create a &quot;Belgian-Congolese community&quot;, in which blacks and whites were to be treated as equals. Regardless, anti-miscegenation laws remained in place, and between 1959 and 1962 thousands of mixed-race Congolese children were forcibly deported from the Congo by the Belgian government and the Catholic Church and taken to Belgium.

In 1957, the first municipal elections open to black voters took place in a handful of the largest cities — Léopoldville, Élisabethville, and Jadotville.

===Abolition of slavery===

In the Belgian Free State, the Belgians had freed thousands of men, women and children slaves from Swaihili Arab slave owners and slave traders in Eastern Congo in 1886–1892, enlisted them in the militia Force Publique or were given as prisoners to allied local chiefs, who in turn gave them as laborers for the Belgian conscript workers; when Belgian Congo was established, chattel slavery was legally abolished in 1910, but prisoners were nevertheless conscripted as force laborers for both public and private work projects.

==Resistance==
Congolese opposition against colonialism was continuous, sustained and took many different forms. It became more likely as modern ideas and education spread. Armed risings occurred sporadically and localized until roughly the end of the Second World War (e.g., revolt of the Pende in 1931, mutiny in Luluabourg 1944). From the end of the Second World War until the late 1950s, the era of what colonial propaganda called a &quot;Pax belgica&quot; prevailed. Until the end of colonial rule in 1960, passive forms of resistance and expressions of an anti-colonial sub-culture were nevertheless manifold and widespread (e.g., Kimbanguism, after the &#x27;prophet&#x27; Simon Kimbangu, who was imprisoned by the Belgians).

Apart from active and passive resistance among the Congolese, the colonial regime over time also elicited internal criticism and dissent. Already in the 1920s, certain members of the Colonial Council in Brussels (among them Octave Louwers) voiced criticism regarding the often brutal recruitment methods employed by the major companies in the mining districts. The stagnation of population growth in many districts—in spite of spectacular successes in the fight against endemic diseases such as sleeping sickness—was another cause for concern. Low birth rates in the countryside and the depopulation of certain areas were typically attributed to the disruption of traditional community life as a result of forced labour migration and mandatory cultivation. Response was often made that that had been the point of the policies, and pointed to the increase of population in the cities, as well as the improvement in health and lifespan due to modern medicine and living conditions. Many missionaries who were in daily contact with Congolese villagers, took their plight in the transition at heart and sometimes intervened on their behalf with the colonial administration (for instance in land property questions).

The missions and certain territorial administrators also played an important role in the study and preservation of Congolese cultural and linguistic traditions and artefacts. One example among many is that of Father Gustaaf Hulstaert (1900–1990), who in 1937 created the periodical &quot;Aequatoria&quot; devoted to the linguistic, ethnographic and historical study of the Mongo people of the central Congo basin. The colonial state took an interest in the cultural and scientific study of the Congo, particularly after the Second World War, through the creation of the &quot;Institut pour la Recherche Scientifique en Afrique Centrale&quot; (IRSAC, 1948).

==Toward independence==
In the early 1950s, political emancipation of the Congolese elites, let alone of the masses, seemed like a distant event. But it was clear that the Congo could not forever remain immune from the rapid changes that, after the Second World War, profoundly affected colonialism around the world. The independence of the British, French and Dutch colonies in Asia shortly after 1945 had little immediate effect in the Congo, but in the United Nations pressure on Belgium (as on other colonial powers) increased. Belgium had ratified article 73 of the United Nations Charter, which advocated self-determination, and both superpowers put pressure on Belgium to reform its Congo policy; the Belgian government tried to resist what it described as &#x27;interference&#x27; with its colonial policy.

Colonial authorities discussed ways to ameliorate the situation of the Congolese. Since the 1940s, the colonial government had experimented in a very modest way with granting a limited elite of so-called &quot;évolués&quot; more civil rights, holding out the eventual prospect of a limited amount of political influence. To this end &quot;deserving&quot; Congolese could apply for a proof of &quot;civil merit&quot;, or, one step up, &#x27;immatriculation&#x27; (registration), i.e., official evidence of their assimilation with European civilisation. To acquire this status, the applicant had to fulfill strict conditions (monogamous matrimony, evidence of good behaviour, etc.) and submit to stringent controls (including house visits). This policy was a failure. By the mid-1950s, there were at best a few thousand Congolese who had successfully obtained the civil merit diploma or been granted &quot;immatriculation&quot;. The supposed benefits attached to it—including equal legal status with the white population—proved often more theory than reality and led to open frustration with the &quot;évolués&quot;. When Governor-General Pétillon began to speak about granting the native people more civil rights, even suffrage, to create what he termed a &quot;Belgo-Congolese community&quot;, his ideas were met with indifference from Brussels and often with open hostility from some of the Belgians in the Congo, who feared for their privileges.

It became increasingly evident that the Belgian government lacked a strategic long-term vision in relation to the Congo. &#x27;Colonial affairs&#x27; did not generate much interest or political debate in Belgium, so long as the colony seemed to be thriving and calm. A notable exception was the young King Baudouin, who had succeeded his father, King Leopold III, under dramatic circumstances in 1951, when Leopold III was forced to abdicate. Baudouin took a close interest in the Belgian Congo.

On his first state visit to the Belgian Congo in 1955, King Baudouin was welcomed enthusiastically by cheering crowds of whites and blacks alike, as captured in André Cauvin&#x27;s documentary film, &quot;Bwana Kitoko&quot;. Foreign observers, such as the international correspondent of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; or a &quot;Time&quot; journalist, remarked that Belgian paternalism &quot;seemed to work&quot;, and contrasted Belgium&#x27;s seemingly loyal and enthusiastic colonial subjects with the restless French and British colonies. On the occasion of his visit, King Baudouin openly endorsed the Governor-General&#x27;s vision of a &quot;Belgo-Congolese community&quot;; but, in practice, this idea progressed slowly. At the same time, divisive ideological and linguistic issues in Belgium, which heretofore had been successfully kept out of the colony&#x27;s affairs, began to affect the Congo as well. These included the rise of unionism among workers, the call for public (state) schools to break the missions&#x27; monopoly on education, and the call for equal treatment in the colony of both Belgian national languages: French and Dutch. Until then, French had been promoted as the unique colonial language. The Governor-General feared that such divisive issues would undermine the authority of the colonial government in the eyes of the Congolese, while also diverting attention from the more pressing need for true emancipation.

===Political organisation===
Congolese participation in the Second World War and news of changes in other colonies resulted in their organising to gain more power. As a result of the inability of the colonial government to introduce radical and credible changes, the Congolese elites began to organise themselves socially and soon also politically. In the 1950s, two markedly different forms of nationalism arose among the Congolese elites. The nationalist movement—to which the Belgian authorities, to some degree, turned a blind eye—promoted territorial nationalism, wherein the Belgian Congo would become one politically united state after independence.

In opposition to this was the ethno-religious and regional nationalism that took hold in the Bakongo territories of the west coast, Kasai and Katanga. The first political organisations were of the latter type. ABAKO, founded in 1950 as the &quot;Association culturelle des Bakongo&quot; and headed by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, was initially a cultural association that soon turned political. From the mid-1950s, it became a vocal opponent of Belgian colonial rule. Additionally, the organization continued to serve as the major ethno-religious organization for the Bakongo and became closely intertwined with the Kimbanguist Church, which was extremely popular in the lower Congo.

In 1955, Belgian professor Antoine van Bilsen published a treatise called &quot;Thirty Year Plan for the Political Emancipation of Belgian Africa&quot;. The timetable called for the gradual emancipation of the Congo over a 30-year period—the time Van Bilsen expected it would take to create an educated elite who could replace the Belgians in positions of power. The Belgian government and many of the &quot;évolués&quot; were suspicious of the plan—the former because it meant eventually giving up the Congo, and the latter because Belgium would continue to rule for another three decades. A group of Catholic &quot;évolués&quot; responded positively to the plan with a moderate manifesto in a Congolese journal called &quot;Conscience Africaine&quot;; they raised issues as to the extent of Congolese participation.

In 1957, by way of experiment, the colonial government organised the first municipal elections in three urban centres (Léopoldville, Elisabethville and Jadotville), in which Congolese people were allowed to stand for office and cast their vote. Events in 1957–58 led to a sudden acceleration in the demands for political emancipation. The independence of Ghana in 1957 and President De Gaulle&#x27;s August 1958 visit to Brazzaville, the capital of the French Congo, on the other side of the Congo river to Léopoldville, in which he promised France&#x27;s African colonies the free choice between a continued association with France or full independence, aroused ambitions in the Congo. The World Exhibition organised in Brussels in 1958 (Expo 58) proved another eye-opener for many Congolese leaders, who were allowed to travel to Belgium for the first time.

In 1958, the demands for independence radicalised quickly and gained momentum. A key role was played by the &quot;Mouvement National Congolais&quot; (MNC). First set up in 1956, the MNC was established in October 1958 as a national political party that supported the goal of a unitary and centralised Congolese nation. Its most influential leader was the charismatic Patrice Lumumba. In 1959, an internal split was precipitated by Albert Kalonji and other MNC leaders who favoured a more moderate political stance (the splinter group was deemed Mouvement National Congolais-Kalonji). Despite the organisational divergence of the party, Lumumba&#x27;s leftist faction (now the Mouvement National Congolais-Lumumba) and the MNC collectively had established themselves as by far the most important and influential party in the Belgian Congo. Belgium vehemently opposed Lumumba&#x27;s leftist views and had grave concerns about the status of their financial interests should Lumumba&#x27;s MNC gain power.

===Independence===
While the Belgian government was debating a programme to gradually extend the political emancipation of the Congolese population, it was overtaken by events. On 4 January 1959, a prohibited political demonstration organised in Léopoldville by ABAKO got out of hand. At once, the colonial capital was in the grip of extensive rioting. It took the authorities several days to restore order and, by the most conservative count, several hundred died. The eruption of violence sent a shockwave through the Congo and Belgium alike. On 13 January, King Baudouin addressed the nation by radio and declared that Belgium would work towards the full independence of the Congo &quot;without delay, but also without irresponsible rashness&quot;.

Without committing to a specific date for independence, the government of prime minister Gaston Eyskens had a multi-year transition period in mind. They thought provincial elections would take place in December 1959, national elections in 1960 or 1961, after which administrative and political responsibilities would be gradually transferred to the Congolese, in a process presumably to be completed towards the mid-1960s. On the ground, circumstances were changing much more rapidly. Increasingly, the colonial administration saw varied forms of resistance, such as refusal to pay taxes. In some regions anarchy threatened. At the same time many Belgians resident in the Congo opposed independence, feeling betrayed by Brussels. Faced with a radicalisation of Congolese demands, the government saw the chances of a gradual and carefully planned transition dwindling rapidly.

In 1959, King Baudouin made another visit to the Belgian Congo, finding a great contrast with his visit of four years before. Upon his arrival in Léopoldville, he was pelted with rocks by black Belgo-Congolese citizens who were angry with the imprisonment of Lumumba, convicted because of incitement against the colonial government. Though Baudouin&#x27;s reception in other cities was considerably better, the shouts of &quot;Vive le roi!&quot; were often followed by &quot;Indépendance immédiate!&quot; The Belgian government wanted to avoid being drawn into a futile and potentially very bloody colonial war, as had happened to France in Indochina and Algeria, or to the Netherlands in Indonesia. For that reason, it was inclined to give in to the demands for immediate independence voiced by the Congolese leaders. Despite lack of preparation and an insufficient number of educated elite (there were only a handful of Congolese holding a university degree at that time), the Belgian leaders hoped that they could handle what they said they wanted, and decided to let them have it. This became known as &quot;&quot;—the Congolese bet.

In January 1960, Congolese political leaders were invited to Brussels to participate in a round-table conference to discuss independence. Patrice Lumumba was discharged from prison for the occasion. The conference agreed surprisingly quickly to grant the Congolese practically all of their demands: a general election to be held in May 1960 and full independence—&quot;Dipenda&quot;—on 30 June 1960. This was in response to the strong united front put up by the Congolese delegation.
Political maneuvering ahead of the elections resulted in the emergence of three political alliances: a coalition of the federalistic nationalists consisting of six separatist parties or organizations, two of which were ABAKO and the MNC—Kalonji; the centralist MNC—Lumumba; and that of Moïse Tshombe, the strong-man of Katanga, who wanted to preserve the economic vitality of its area and the business interests of the Union Minière (as Kalonji did with respect to the diamond exploitations in Kasaï). The parliamentary elections resulted in a divided political landscape, with both the regionalist factions—chief among them ABAKO—and the nationalist parties such as the MNC, doing well. A compromise arrangement was forced through, with Kasa-vubu becoming the first president of the Republic of the Congo, and Lumumba its first head of government. As planned scarcely five months earlier, the hand-over ceremony by the Belgians took place on time on 30 June 1960 at the new residence of the Governor-General of the Belgian Congo in Léopoldville.

One week later, a rebellion broke out within the &quot;Force Publique&quot; against its officers, who were still predominantly Belgian. This was a catalyst for disturbances arising all over the Congo, mainly instigated by dissatisfied soldiers and radicalized youngsters. In many areas, their violence specifically targeted European victims. Within weeks, the Belgian military and later a United Nations intervention force evacuated the largest part of the more than 80,000 Belgians who were still working and living in the Congo.

==Congo Crisis and aftermath==

The rebellion that had started in Thyssville in the Bas-Congo in July 1960 quickly spread to the rest of the Congo. In September 1960, the leaders split, with President Kasa-Vubu declaring prime minister Lumumba deposed from his functions, and vice versa. The stalemate was ended with the government&#x27;s arrest of Lumumba. In January 1961, he was flown to the rich mining province of Katanga, which by that time had declared a secession from Léopoldville under the leadership of Moïse Tshombe (with active Belgian support). Lumumba was handed over to Katangan authorities, who executed him.
In 2002 Belgium officially apologised for its role in the assassination of Lumumba; the CIA has long been speculated of complicity, as they had seen Lumumba&#x27;s politics were too far left. The Soviet Union during the Cold War years was active in expanding its influence in Africa against European powers, giving &#x27;anti-colonialism&#x27; as a rationale for the increase of its power in the region. A series of rebellions and separatist movements seemed to shatter the dream of a unitary Congolese state at its birth. Although the nation was independent, Belgian paratroopers intervened in the Congo on various occasions to protect and evacuate Belgian and international citizens. The United Nations maintained a large peace-keeping operation in the Congo from late 1960 onward. The situation did not stabilise until 1964–65. Katanga province was re-absorbed and the so-called Simba Rebellion ended in Stanleyville (province Orientale). Shortly after that army colonel Joseph Désiré Mobutu ended the political impasse by seizing power in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

Mobutu had some support in the West, and in particular in the United States, because of his strong anti-communist stance. Initially his rule favored consolidation and economic development (e.g., by building the Inga dam that had been planned in the 1950s). In order to distance himself from the previous regime, he launched a campaign of Congolese &quot;authenticity&quot;. The government abandoned the use of colonial place names in 1966: Léopoldville was renamed as Kinshasa, Elisabethville as Lubumbashi, Stanleyville as Kisangani. During this period, the Congo generally maintained close economic and political ties with Belgium. Certain financial issues had remained unresolved after independence (the so-called &quot;contentieux&quot;), for instance, the transfer of shares in the big mining companies that had been held directly by the colonial state. In 1970, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of independence, King Baudouin paid an official state visit to the Congo.

Mobutu&#x27;s régime became more radical during the 1970s. The &quot;Mouvement populaire de la Révolution&quot; (MPR), of which Mobutu was the &quot;président-fondateur&quot;, firmly established one-party rule. Political repression increased considerably. Mobutu renamed the Congo as the republic of Zaïre. The so-called &quot;Zaïrisation&quot; of the country in the mid-1970s led to an exodus of foreign workers and economic disaster. In the 1980s the Mobutu regime became a byword for mismanagement and corruption. Relations with Belgium, the former colonial power, went through a series of ups and downs, reflecting a steady decline in the underlying economic, financial and political interests. As there was no danger of the country falling into Soviet hands, the Western powers maintained a neutral stance.
After the fall of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War in the late 1980s, Mobutu lost support in the West. As a result, in 1990, he decided to end the one-party system and dramatically announced a return to democracy. But he dragged his feet and played out his opponents against one another to gain time. A bloody intervention of the Zaïrian Army against students on the Lubumbashi University Campus in May 1990 precipitated a break in diplomatic relations between Belgium and Zaïre. Pointedly, Mobutu was not invited to attend the funeral of King Baudouin in 1993, which he considered a grave personal affront.

In 1997 Mobutu was forced from power by a rebel force headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who declared himself president and renamed Zaïre as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Assassinated in 2001, Kabila was succeeded by his son Joseph Kabila. In 2006 Joseph Kabila was confirmed as president through the first nationwide free elections in the Congo since 1960. On 30 June – 2 July 2010, King Albert II and Yves Leterme, the Belgian Prime Minister, visited Kinshasa to attend the festivities marking the 50th anniversary of Congolese independence.

Certain practices and traditions from the colonial period have survived into the independent Congolese state. It maintains a strong centralising and bureaucratic tendency, and has kept the organizational structure of the education system and the judiciary. The influence of the Congo on Belgium has been manifested mainly in economic terms: through the activities of the Union Minière (now Umicore), the development of a nonferrous metal industry, and the development of the Port of Antwerp and diamond industry. To this day, Brussels Airlines (successor of the former Sabena) has maintained a strong presence in the DRC. It was estimated that in 2010, more than 4,000 Belgian nationals were resident in the DRC, and the Congolese community in Belgium was at least 16,000 strong. The &quot;Matongé&quot; quarter in Brussels is the traditional focal point of the Congolese community in Belgium.

==Culture==

===Music===
In popular music, Latin music such as rumba was introduced from Cuba in the 1930s and 1940s during the colonial era, and Latin music was played extensively in the Belgian Congo. In the 1950s, American jazz was also widely accepted as African jazz. In 1956, Franco formed OK Jazz (later renamed TPOK Jazz).

Joseph Kabasele, also known as &quot;Le Grand Kallé&quot; (The Great Kallé), formed African Jazz. House bands became popular, and rumba congolaise were formed. Marlo Mashi is a musician of the same era. Congo&#x27;s popular music evolved from continental rhythm, church music, Ghana&#x27;s high life, and traditional Congo music.

<text>Alexander Theodore &quot;Sasha&quot; Shulgin (June 17, 1925 – June 2, 2014) was an American biochemist, broad researcher of synthetic psychoactive compounds, and author of works regarding these, who independently explored the organic chemistry and pharmacology of such agents—in his mid-life and later, many through preparation in his home laboratory, and testing on himself. He is acknowledged to have introduced to broader use, in the late 1970s, the prior synthesized compound MDMA (&quot;ecstasy&quot;), in research psychopharmacology and in combination with conventional therapy, the latter through presentations and academic publications, including to psychologists; and for the rediscovery, occasional discovery, and regular synthesis and personal use and distribution, of possibly hundreds of psychoactive compounds (for their psychedelic and MDMA-like empathogenic bioactivities). As such, Shulgin is seen both as a pioneering and a controversial participant in the emergence of the broad use of psychedelics.

In 1991 and 1997, he and his wife Ann Shulgin compiled the books &quot;PiHKAL&quot; and &quot;TiHKAL&quot; (&quot;Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved&quot;, likewise for &quot;Tryptamines&quot;), from notebooks that extensively described their work and personal experiences with these two classes of psychoactive drugs. Shulgin documented the chemical synthesis of many of these compounds. Some of the syntheses catalogued by Shulgin in his books include chemicals in the 2C family (such as 2C-B), compounds of the DOx family (such as DOM), and tryptamines (such as 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MiPT).

In describing Shulgin&#x27;s work in psychedelic research and his preparation and experimentation with psychedelic drugs, he has been dubbed the &quot;godfather of ecstasy&quot; (and to a much more limited extent, the &quot;godfather of psychedelics&quot;).

Writing in 2005—in the decade before Shulgin&#x27;s death—a retrospective by Drake Bennett of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; noted that as a consequence of Shulgin&#x27;s testing his various synthetic compounds &quot;for activity by taking the chemicals himself ... most of the scientific community consider[ed] Shulgin at best a curiosity and at worst a menace&quot;, but Bennett goes on to say that &quot;near the end ... [Shulgin&#x27;s] faith in the potential of psychedelics ha[d] at least a chance at vindication&quot;, going on to note the various clinical trials underway on compounds of interest to Shulgin. The early 2000s also was a period where Shulgin was witness to a series of incidents in which young men overdosed on a novel psychoactive agent whose preparation was disclosed by Shulgin in one of his books. Before his death (and before the onset of his late life dementia), Shulgin expressed sadness over the deaths, but argued that all drugs, including aspirin, carry risks with incorrect use.

==Early life and career ==
Shulgin was born in Berkeley, California, to Theodore Stevens Shulgin (1893–1978) and Henrietta D. (Aten) Shulgin (1894–1960). His father was born in Chelyabinsk, Russia; his mother was born in Illinois. Theodore and Henrietta were public school teachers in Alameda County.

Shulgin studied organic chemistry at Harvard University as a scholarship student, and was enrolled there at the age of 16. He dropped out to join the U.S. Navy, during his second year at Harvard. In 1944 a military nurse gave Shulgin a glass of orange juice prior to a surgery for a thumb infection, while serving on USS &quot;Pope&quot; during World War II; he drank the juice and, assuming that crystals at the bottom of the glass were a sedative, &quot;fell unconscious&quot;. Upon waking he learned that the crystals were undissolved sugar, and that doctors had administered anesthesia after he was already unconscious—an experience Drake Bennett of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; referred to as &quot;revelatory&quot;, and a &quot;tantalizing hint of the mind&#x27;s odd strength&quot;, as &quot;his collapse was caused entirely by the placebo effect&quot;.

After serving in the armed forces, Shulgin returned to California, and earned his PhD in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley. Through the late 1950s, Shulgin completed post-doctoral work in the fields of psychiatry and pharmacology at University of California, San Francisco. After working at Bio-Rad Laboratories as a research director for a brief period, he began work at Dow Chemical Company, One of his early achievements at Dow was the invention of the first known biodegradable pesticide (mexacarbate).

At this time he had a series of psychedelic experiences that helped to shape his further goals and research, the first of which was brought on by mescaline. &quot;I first explored mescaline in the late &#x27;50s ... Three-hundred-fifty to 400 milligrams. I learned there was a great deal inside me.&quot;

Shulgin later reported personal revelations that &quot;had been brought about by a fraction of a gram of a white solid, but that in no way whatsoever could it be argued that these memories had been contained within the white solid ... I understood that our entire universe is contained in the mind and the spirit. We may choose not to find access to it, we may even deny its existence, but it is indeed there inside us, and there are chemicals that can catalyze its availability.&quot;

Shulgin&#x27;s professional activities continued to lean in the direction of psychopharmacology, furthered by his personal experiences with psychedelics. But during this period he was unable to do much independent research. His opportunity for further research came in 1961 after his development of Zectran, the first biodegradable pesticide, a highly profitable product. In his book &quot;PiHKAL&quot;, Shulgin limits his pesticide days at Dow Chemical to one sentence in 978 pages. Dow Chemical Company, in return for Zectran&#x27;s valuable patent, gave Shulgin great freedom. During this time, he created and patented drugs when Dow asked, and published findings on other drugs in journals such as &quot;Nature&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Organic Chemistry&quot;. One of these patents, approved in 1970, involved phenethylamines. Eventually, Dow Chemical requested that he no longer use their name on his publications.

In late 1966, Shulgin left Dow in order to pursue his own interests. He first spent two years studying neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, leaving to work on a consulting project. He set up a home-based lab on his property, known as &quot;the Farm&quot;, and became a private consultant. He also taught classes in the local universities and at the San Francisco General Hospital. Through his friend Bob Sager, head of the U.S. DEA&#x27;s Western Laboratories, Shulgin formed a relationship with the DEA and began holding pharmacology seminars for the agents, supplying the DEA with samples of various compounds, and occasionally serving as an expert witness in court. In 1988, he authored a then-definitive law enforcement reference book on controlled substances, and received several awards from the DEA.

===Independent research===
In order to work with scheduled psychoactive chemicals, Shulgin obtained a DEA Schedule I license for an analytical laboratory, which allowed him to synthesize and possess any otherwise illicit drug. Shulgin set up a chemical synthesis laboratory in a small building behind his house, which gave him a great deal of career autonomy. Shulgin used this freedom to synthesize and test the effects of potentially psychoactive drugs.

In 1976, Shulgin was introduced to MDMA by a student in the medicinal chemistry group he advised at San Francisco State University. MDMA had been synthesized in 1912 by Merck and patented in 1913 as an intermediate of another synthesis in order to block competitors, but was never explored in its own right. Shulgin went on to develop a new synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff used the substance in his practice in small doses as an aid to talk therapy. Zeff introduced the substance to hundreds of psychologists and lay therapists around the nation, including Ann (born Laura Ann Gotlieb), whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981. It was her fourth marriage, and she had four children.

After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a small group of friends with whom he regularly tested his creations, starting in 1960. They developed a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, mescaline, and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect—some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation—all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin&#x27;s laboratory notebooks. Shulgin published many of these objective and subjective reports in his books and papers. About 2C-B he said in 2003: &quot;It is, in my opinion, one of the most graceful, erotic, sensual, introspective compounds I have ever invented. For most people, it is a short-lived and comfortable psychedelic, with neither toxic side-effects nor next-day hang-over.&quot;

In 1994, two years after the publication of &quot;PIHKAL&quot;, the DEA raided his lab. The agency requested that Shulgin surrender his license for violating its terms, and he was fined $25,000 for possession of anonymous samples sent to him for quality testing. In the 15 years preceding the publication of &quot;PIHKAL&quot;, two announced and scheduled reviews failed to find any irregularities. Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA&#x27;s San Francisco Field Division, has stated that, &quot;It is our opinion that those books are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs. Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books.&quot;

Prior to his 2010 health issues, Shulgin had been working on a series of N-allylated tryptamines including 5-MeO-DALT and 5-MeO-MALT.

==Personal life, health, and death==
Shulgin was married to Nina Gordon until her death from a stroke in 1977. He then married author Ann Gotlieb in 1981. He spent most of his later life at the Farm in Lafayette, California.

On April 8, 2008, at the age of 82, he underwent surgery to replace a defective aortic valve. On November 16, 2010, he suffered a stroke, from which he largely recovered. Also at the close of 2010, a skin-grafting surgery saved his left foot from being amputated. Around this time, Shulgin began showing early signs of dementia, mostly severe loss of short-term memory. With progression of the dementia since 2010, his wife, Ann Shulgin, had been trying to sell part of their property to raise more money to cover care costs.

On April 17, 2014, Ann Shulgin reported on Facebook that her husband had developed liver cancer, and in a May 31 update on Facebook she said that, although appearing frail, he seemed to be experiencing his last moments in peace and without pain. Shulgin died at his home on June 2, 2014, at the age of 88.

== Legacy ==
In a 2014 review of the synthesis of designer drugs, the effects of Shulgin&#x27;s work were described as &quot;by far the most far-reaching&quot; effects associated with the cultural climate of interest at the time in hallucinogenic compounds generally and mescaline in particular, with which various artists and writers had experimented. Shulgin said that mescaline made him aware of a world submerged in human spirit, whose &quot;availability&quot; was &quot;catalyzed&quot; by such chemicals; the consequences of his insights were called &quot;devastating&quot; by the reviewers. In the same review, an example of his insights was given by his description of MDMA as &quot;his low-calorie Martini&quot;.

== Societies ==
Shulgin was a member of Mensa International and frequently attended Mensa events in California.

Alexander was a Bohemian Club member. The Bohemian club is located in California where Alexander lived. Alexander refers to &quot;The Owl Club&quot; in chapter 11 of &quot;PiHKAL&quot;:

<doc id="57818" wikidata="Q151938" url="?curid=57818" title="Neutral Moresnet">
<text>Neutral Moresnet (, , , ) was a small Belgian–Prussian condominium in western Europe that existed from 1816 to 1921 and was administered jointly by the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (Belgium after its independence in 1830) and the Kingdom of Prussia. It was wide and long, with an area of . After 1830, the territory&#x27;s northernmost border point at Vaalserberg connected it to a quadripoint shared additionally with the Dutch Province of Limburg, the Prussian Rhine Province, and the Belgian Liège Province. That border point&#x27;s position is currently represented by the Three-Country Point, the meeting place of the borders of Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.

During the First World War, Neutral Moresnet was annexed by Germany. The armistice between France and Germany in November 1918 forced Germany to withdraw from Belgium and Neutral Moresnet. A year later, the Treaty of Versailles awarded Neutral Moresnet to Belgium, as from 10 January 1921, when it become the municipality of Kelmis.

During the Second World War, Kelmis and the surrounding area were annexed by Germany and its name was changed to Moresnet. The territory was returned to Belgium at the end of the war.

==History==

===Origins===
After the demise of Napoleon&#x27;s Empire, the Congress of Vienna of 1814–15 redrew the European map, intending to create a balance of power in Europe. One of the borders to be delineated was the one between the newly created United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Prussia. Both parties could agree on the larger part of the territory, as borders mostly followed older lines, but the district of Moresnet proved problematic, mainly because of a valuable zinc spar mine named Altenberg (German) or Vieille Montagne (French) located there. The governments of both the Netherlands and Prussia desired to appropriate this resource, which was needed for the production of zinc and brass – at that time, Bristol in the United Kingdom was the only other place where zinc ore was processed.

In December 1815, Dutch and Prussian representatives convened in nearby Aachen, and on 26 June 1816 a compromise was obtained, dividing the district of Moresnet into three parts. The Dutch absorbed the village of Moresnet itself into Liège Province, while the Prussian village Moresnet (renamed Neu-Moresnet after ) became part of the Prussian Rhine Province and the mine and village adjacent became a neutral territory pending a future agreement. The two powers, whose armies were prohibited from occupying the area, established a joint administration.

When Belgium gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1830, the Belgians assumed control of the Dutch role in Neutral Moresnet (though the Dutch never formally ceded their claim).

===Borders===
Formal installation of border demarcation markers for the territory occurred on 23 September 1818. The territory of Neutral Moresnet had a somewhat triangular shape with the base being the main road from Aachen to Liège. The village and mine lay just to the north of this road. To east and west, two straight lines converged on the Vaalserberg.

The roads from Germany and Belgium to the Three‑Country Point are named () and (&#x27;Three Border Stones Road&#x27;) respectively; the road from the Netherlands is called (&#x27;Four Borders Way&#x27;).

===Flag===

From 1883, Neutral Moresnet used a tricolour with horizontal bars in black, white and blue as its territorial flag. The origin is unknown and has been explained in two different ways:
* It is argued by some that the colours were taken from the two conflicting powers&#x27; flags, with black and white representing Prussia and white and blue the Netherlands.
* According to &quot;Flags of the World&quot;, &quot;it seems more likely that the colours have been taken from the emblem of the Vieille Montagne&quot;, a mining company.

===Status===

The territory was governed by two royal commissioners, one from each neighbour. Eventually, these commissioners were commonly civil servants from the Belgian Verviers and the Prussian Eupen. The municipal administration was directed by a mayor appointed by the commissioners.

The Napoleonic civil and penal codes, introduced during French rule, remained in force throughout the existence of Neutral Moresnet. However, since no law court existed in the neutral territory, Belgian and Prussian judges had to come in and decide cases based on the Napoleonic laws. Since there was no administrative court either, the judge&#x27;s decision could not be appealed.

In 1859, Neutral Moresnet was granted a greater measure of self-administration by the installation of a municipal council of ten members. The council, as well as a welfare committee and a school committee, were appointed by the mayor and served an advisory function only. The people had no voting rights.

Life in Neutral Moresnet was dominated by the Vieille Montagne mining company, which not only was the major employer but also operated residences, shops, a hospital and a bank. The mine attracted many workers from the neighboring countries, increasing the population from 256 in 1815 to 2,275 in 1858 and 4,668 in 1914. Most services, such as the mail, were shared between Belgium and Prussia (in a fashion similar to Andorra). There were five schools in the territory, and Prussian subjects could attend the schools in Prussian Moresnet.

Living in the territory had several benefits. Among these were the low taxes (the national budget being fixed at 2,735 Belgian francs throughout most of its history), the absence of import tariffs from both neighbouring countries, and low prices compared to just across the border. A downside to their special status was the fact that people from Neutral Moresnet were considered to be stateless and were not allowed a military of their own.

Many immigrants settled in Moresnet so they would be exempt from military service, but in 1854 Belgium began to conscript its citizens who had relocated to Moresnet, and Prussia did likewise in 1874. From then on, the exemption applied only to descendants of the original inhabitants.

===Currency===
Neutral Moresnet did not have its own currency. The French franc was legal tender. The currencies of Prussia (and then Germany, after 1871), Belgium and the Netherlands were also in circulation. In 1848 local currency began circulating, though these coins were not considered the official medium.

===Uncertain future===

When the mine was exhausted in 1885, the continued survival of Neutral Moresnet was in doubt. Perhaps in response, the next year Dr. Wilhelm Molly (1838–1919), the mine&#x27;s chief medical doctor and an avid philatelist, tried to organise a local postal service with its own stamps. This enterprise was quickly thwarted by Belgian intervention.

About 1900, Germany began a more aggressive policy concerning the territory and was accused of sabotage and obstructing the administrative process in order to force the issue.

A casino was established in August 1903 after the Belgians closed all such resorts in Belgium. The Moresnet casino operated with strict limitations, permitting no local resident to gamble, and no more than 20 people to gather at a time. The venture was abandoned, however, when Kaiser Wilhelm II threatened to partition the territory or cede it to Belgium in order to end the gambling. Around this same time, Moresnet boasted three distilleries for the manufacture of gin.
During 1908, Dr. Molly proposed making Neutral Moresnet the world&#x27;s first Esperanto‑speaking state, named (&quot;friendship-place&quot;). The proposed national anthem was an Esperanto march of the same name, set to the tune of &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot;. A number of residents learned Esperanto and a rally was held in Kelmis to endorse the idea of on 13 August 1908, and a coat of arms was publicized. The World Congress of Esperanto, meeting in Dresden, even declared Neutral Moresnet the world capital of the Esperanto community.

===First World War===

The First World War resulted in the end of neutrality. On 4 August 1914, Germany invaded Belgium, initially leaving Neutral Moresnet as &quot;an oasis in a desert of destruction&quot;. A total of 147 Neutral Moresnet citizens were killed, though it is unclear whether they were killed inside the territory or in fighting outside its borders. On 27 June 1915, Neutral Moresnet was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, although the annexation never received international recognition.

In 1918, the armistice between France and Germany, signed on 11 November at Compiègne, forced Germany to withdraw from Belgium and also from Moresnet. It also resulted in the ousting of Mayor Wilhelm Kyll, a German national who had been appointed after the German invasion.

On 28 June 1919, the Treaty of Versailles settled the dispute that had created the neutral territory a century earlier by awarding Neutral Moresnet, along with Prussian Moresnet and the German cantons of Eupen and Malmedy, to Belgium. The treaty became effective 10 January 1920, ending the territory&#x27;s existence and converting it into a municipality in Belgium.

To distinguish it from the already existing town of Moresnet (in the neighboring municipality of Plombières), Neutral Moresnet was renamed Kelmis (in French: )after &quot;kelme&quot;, the local dialect word for zinc spar.

Despite the annexation, Neutral Moresnet Mayor Pierre Grignard effectively stayed in office and became the first mayor of Kelmis. The ten members of Neutral Moresnet&#x27;s council were confirmed for the Kelmis municipal council after its Prussian members renounced their nationality. They remained in office until the election of a new municipal council on 7 February 1923.

===Post-annexation history===
After 1920, Moresnet shared the history of Eupen-Malmedy. Germany briefly re‑annexed the area during , but it returned to Belgium in 1944. Since 1973, Kelmis has formed a part of the German‑speaking community of Belgium. During 1977, Kelmis absorbed the neighbouring communes of Neu‑Moresnet and Hergenrath.

A small museum in Kelmis, the &quot;Museum Vieille Montagne&quot;, includes exhibits on Neutral Moresnet. Of the 60 border markers for the territory, more than 50 are still standing.

As a company, Vieille Montagne survived Neutral Moresnet. It continues to exist as VMZINC, a part of Union Minière, the latter renamed in 2001 as Umicore, a global materials company.

On 26 October 2016, Catharina Meessen became the last surviving citizen of the former territory after the death of Alwine Hackens-Paffen. In early 2020, Meessen died at the age of 105.

<text>The Open Group is a global consortium that seeks to &quot;enable the achievement of business objectives&quot; by developing &quot;open, vendor-neutral technology standards and certifications.&quot; It has 900+ member organizations and provides a number of services, including strategy, management, innovation and research, standards, certification, and test development. It was established in 1996 when X/Open merged with the Open Software Foundation.

The Open Group is the certifying body for the UNIX trademark, and publishes the Single UNIX Specification technical standard, which extends the POSIX standards. The Open Group also develops and manages the TOGAF standard, which is an industry standard enterprise architecture framework.

==Members==
The 900+ members include a range of technology vendors and buyers as well as government agencies, including, for example, Capgemini, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Orbus Software, IBM, Huawei, the United States Department of Defense and NASA. There is no obligation on product developers or vendors to adopt the standards developed by the association.

Platinum members:

# DXC Technology, United States
# Fujitsu, Japan
# Huawei Technologies, China
# IBM, United States
# Intel, United States
# OpenText, Canada
# Shell, Netherlands

== History ==

By the early 1990s, the major UNIX system vendors had begun to realize that the standards rivalries (often called the &quot;Unix wars&quot;) were causing all participants more harm than good, leaving the UNIX industry open to emerging competition from Microsoft. The COSE initiative in 1993 can be considered to be the first unification step, and the merger of the Open Software Foundation (OSF) and X/Open in 1996 as the ultimate step, in the end of those skirmishes. OSF had previously merged with Unix International in 1994, meaning that the new entity effectively represented all elements of the Unix community of the time.

In January 1997, the responsibility for the X Window System was transferred to The Open Group from the defunct X Consortium. In 1999, X.Org was formed to manage the X Window System, with management services provided by The Open Group. The X.Org members made a number of releases up to and including X11R6.8 while The Open Group provided management services. In 2004, X.Org and The Open Group worked together to establish the newly formed X.Org Foundation which then took control of the x.org domain name, and the stewardship of the X Window System.

== Programs ==

=== Certification ===
Key services of The Open Group are certification programs, including certification for products and best practices: POSIX, UNIX, and O-TTPS.

The Open Group offers certifications for technology professionals. In addition to TOGAF certification which covers tools, services and people certification, The Open Group also administers the following experience-based Professional Certifications: Certified Architect (Open CA), Certification Program Accreditation, Certified Data Scientist (Open CDS), Certified Technical Specialist (Open CTS), and Certified Trusted Technology Practitioner (Open CTTP). The Open Group also offers certification for ArchiMate tools and people, as well as people certification for Open FAIR and IT4IT, standards of The Open Group.

=== Collaboration Services ===
The Open Group also provides a range of services, from initial setup and ongoing operational support to collaboration, standards and best practices development, and assistance with market impact activities. They assist organizations with setting business objectives, strategy and procurement, and also provide certification and test development. This includes services to the government agencies, suppliers, and companies or organizations set up by governments.

<doc id="57820" wikidata="Q426828" url="?curid=57820" title="Donnie Darko">
<text>Donnie Darko is a 2001 American science fiction psychological thriller film written and directed by Richard Kelly, and produced by Flower Films. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Katharine Ross, Patrick Swayze, and Noah Wyle. Set in October 1988, the film follows Donnie Darko (Gyllenhaal), an emotionally troubled teenager who inadvertently escapes a bizarre accident by sleepwalking. He has visions of Frank, a mysterious figure in a rabbit costume who informs him that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.

Development began in late 1997 when Kelly had graduated from film school and started writing scripts. He took an early idea of a jet engine falling onto a house with no one knowing its origin and built the story around it. Kelly insisted on directing the film himself and struggled to secure backing from producers until 2000, when Pandora Cinema and Barrymore&#x27;s Flower Films agreed to produce it on a $4.5 million budget. Filming took 28 days in the summer of 2000, mostly in California. The soundtrack features a cover of &quot;Mad World&quot; by Tears for Fears by American musicians Gary Jules and Michael Andrews, which went to No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks and was the Christmas number 1 in 2003.

&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2001, followed by a limited theatrical release on October 26. Because the film&#x27;s advertising featured a crashing plane and the September 11 attacks had occurred a month and a half before, it was scarcely advertised. This affected its box office performance and it grossed just $517,375 in its initial run. However, the film gained a cult following, and after reissues, it went on to gross $7.5 million worldwide, and earned more than $10 million in US home video sales. It was listed No. 2 in &quot;Empire&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest Independent Films of All Time,&quot; and No. 53 in &quot;Empire&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Movies of All Time.&quot; Kelly released &quot;Donnie Darko: The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; in 2004. The film was adapted into a stage production in 2007 and a sequel, &quot;S. Darko&quot;, followed in 2009 without Kelly&#x27;s involvement. In 2021, he announced that work on a new sequel is in progress.

==Plot==
On October 2, 1988, troubled teenager Donald &quot;Donnie&quot; Darko sleepwalks outside, led by a mysterious voice. Once outside, he meets a figure named Frank in a monstrous rabbit costume. Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in precisely 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Donnie wakes up the next morning on the green of a local golf course and returns home to discover a jet engine has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the FAA investigators do not know its origin.

Over the next several days, Donnie continues to have visions of Frank, and his parents, Eddie and Rose, send him to psychotherapist Dr. Thurman. Thurman believes Donnie is detached from reality and that his visions of Frank are &quot;daylight hallucinations,&quot; symptomatic of paranoid schizophrenia. Frank asks Donnie if he believes in time travel, and Donnie in turn asks his science teacher, Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff. Monnitoff gives Donnie &quot;The Philosophy of Time Travel&quot;, a book written by Roberta Sparrow, a former science teacher at the school who is now a seemingly senile old woman living outside of town, known to the local teenagers as Grandma Death. Donnie also starts dating Gretchen Ross, who has recently moved into town with her mother under a new identity to escape her violent stepfather.

Frank begins to influence Donnie&#x27;s actions through his sleepwalking episodes, including causing him to flood his high school by breaking a water main. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer attributes the act of vandalism to the influence of the short story &quot;The Destructors,&quot; assigned by dedicated English teacher Karen Pomeroy. Kitty begins teaching &quot;attitude lessons&quot; taken from local motivational speaker Jim Cunningham, but Donnie rebels against these, leading to friction between Kitty and Rose. Kitty arranges for Cunningham to speak at a school assembly, where Donnie insults him. He later finds Cunningham&#x27;s wallet and address, and Frank suggests setting his house on fire. Firefighters discover a hoard of child pornography there. Cunningham is arrested, and Kitty, who wishes to testify in his defense, asks Rose to chaperone their daughters&#x27; dance troupe on its trip to Los Angeles.

With Rose in Los Angeles and Eddie away for business, Donnie and Elizabeth hold a Halloween costume party to celebrate Elizabeth&#x27;s acceptance to Harvard. At the party, Gretchen arrives distraught as her mother has gone missing, and she and Donnie have sex for the first time. When Donnie realizes that Frank&#x27;s prophesied end of the world is only hours away, he takes Gretchen and two other friends to see Sparrow. Instead of Sparrow, they find two high school bullies, Seth and Ricky, who are trying to rob Sparrow&#x27;s home. Donnie, Seth, and Ricky fight in the road in front of her house just as Sparrow returns home. The bullies and Donnie&#x27;s two friends leave when an oncoming car runs over Gretchen, killing her. The driver turns out to be Elizabeth&#x27;s boyfriend, Frank Anderson, wearing the same rabbit costume from Donnie&#x27;s visions. Donnie shoots Frank in the eye with his father&#x27;s gun and walks home carrying Gretchen&#x27;s body.

Donnie returns home as a vortex forms over his house. He borrows one of his parents&#x27; cars, loads Gretchen&#x27;s body into it, and drives to a nearby ridge that overlooks the town. There, he watches as the plane carrying Rose and the dance troupe home from Los Angeles gets caught in the vortex&#x27;s wake, violently ripping off one of its engines and sending it back in time. Events of the previous 28 days unwind. Donnie wakes up in his bedroom, recognizes the date is October 2, and laughs as the jet engine falls into his bedroom, crushing him. Around town, those whose lives Donnie would have touched wake up from troubled dreams. Gretchen rides by the Darko home the following day and learns of Donnie&#x27;s death. Gretchen asks the neighbor, &quot;What was his name?&quot; Gretchen and Rose exchange glances and wave as if they know each other but cannot remember from where.

===Writing===

The film originated in late 1997 when Kelly, aged 22, had graduated from USC School of Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles. While earning money as a client&#x27;s assistant at a post-production house, he thought about his future and decided to write his first feature-length script. The task frightened Kelly at first because he did not want to produce something that was poor in quality. It was not until October 1998 when Kelly felt the time was right to write a script and wrote &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; in 28 days, the same time period as the film. The time of year influenced Kelly to set the film around Halloween.

Kelly set out to write something &quot;ambitious, personal, and nostalgic&quot; about the 1980s which &quot;pushed the envelope by combining science fiction with a coming-of-age tale&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; homed in on the 1980s coming-of-age story aspect by observing the influence of John Hughes, noting the &quot;ineffectual&quot; adults and the fact that Donnie&#x27;s &quot;suffering is a way to make him more sensitive&quot;. Kelly summarized the script was to be &quot;an amusing and poignant recollection of suburban America in the Reagan era&quot;. He recalled a news story that he had read as a child, which he later called an urban legend, about a large piece of ice falling from the wing of a plane and crashing through a boy&#x27;s bedroom, who was not there at the time and thus escaped death. Kelly used this to develop an initial idea of a jet engine falling onto a house and no one could determine its origin. He then built the rest of the script with the aim of resolving the mystery at the end while taking a &quot;most interesting voyage&quot; to get there, although at this point he knew the plane was to be one that Donnie&#x27;s mother was on and was from a different dimension. At one point Kelly considered replacing the jet engine with a piece of ice, like he had read. He based the film&#x27;s concept of time travel and alternate universes from reading &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; by Stephen Hawking.

Kelly was adamant to set the film in 1988, thinking it would be fresh to explore the era and depict a society that he had not seen in a film before. Later he admitted that he felt pressured to make the setting more contemporary. However, he could not figure out how to make the story work in such a setting and retained the original setting. The first draft had Donnie originally wake up at a shopping mall, rather than a golf course. Kelly got ideas for Donnie&#x27;s experiences of paranoid schizophrenia from researching the topic online. He considered such a broad disorder that is difficult to define was &quot;a great way to ground a supernatural story&quot; in a scientific sense. The first draft was between 145–150 pages; Kelly did not change what he had initially written as he was aware that stopping to review it would have caused him to second guess himself. He presented it to producer Sean McKittrick, who recalled &quot;had never read anything like this before&quot;, and helped refine the script while making the story understandable enough. After two more drafts were written, the pair finalized a 128-page script. Kelly felt that had he clarified the film&#x27;s ending any further, &quot;the film would collapse under its own pretension&quot;, and credited McKittrick, Juvonen, and Gyllenhaal, who he said were &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;vocal&quot; in not letting there be one simple answer to the plot.

There are some autobiographical links with Kelly and the film; he said there is &quot;plenty of me&quot; in Donnie&#x27;s character. Kelly grew up in Midlothian, Virginia, also a suburban town, where a local woman called Grandma Death would stand by the road and constantly open and close her mailbox. Kelly also incorporated the moment he almost ran over a homeless person while driving, arguments with his school teachers over the curriculum, and his personal experiences with sleepwalking into the narrative. The word &quot;fuck-ass&quot;, used in the Darko family dinner scene, was something that two of Kelly&#x27;s film school friends used during their occasional exchange of insults. Frank was to be a rabbit since the beginning, but Kelly was unsure whether the character originated from a dream or his longtime interest in the animal novel &quot;Watership Down&quot; by Richard Adams. The novel was to be taught in Karen&#x27;s English class after the school had censored Graham Greene from her curriculum; it was a subplot that was abandoned in the theatrical version but included in the director&#x27;s cut.

===Development===
Kelly knew that the film&#x27;s complicated story would be difficult to pitch to producers without a script, so he had producers read it first before discussing it with them further. While pitching the script, Kelly and McKittrick insisted that Kelly direct the film, which hindered its chances at being picked up. Kelly recalled 1999 being a year of &quot;meeting after meeting&quot;, all of which ended in rejection, and at this point declared the film &quot;dead&quot;. McKittrick said &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; was &quot;the challenging script in town that everybody wanted to make, but was too afraid&quot;.
A turning point arrived when agents John Campisi and Rob Paris at the Creative Artists Agency took an interest in the script and signed Kelly on. Kelly said his &quot;jaw was on the floor&quot; at the unexpected offer, which greatly boosted the chances of having the film made with the agency&#x27;s stamp on the script. This led to further meetings with several prominent individuals, including Francis Ford Coppola, Ben Stiller, William Horberg, and Betty Thomas. Kelly&#x27;s meeting with Coppola was particularly influential, as Coppola drew his attention to one of Karen&#x27;s lines after she is fired—&quot;The kids have to figure it all out these days, because the parents, they don&#x27;t have a clue&quot;—and Kelly recalled: &quot;He slid the binder down the big table and very dramatically said: &#x27;That&#x27;s what your whole movie&#x27;s about right there.&#x27;&quot; Early on Vince Vaughn was offered the role of Donnie, but he turned it down as he felt he was too old for the part. Mark Wahlberg was also approached, but he insisted that he should play Donnie with a lisp.

Development progressed in early 2000, when actor Jason Schwartzman expressed an interest in the script and agreed to play as Donnie. Kelly said this moment &quot;legitimized me as a director&quot; and recalled &quot;all of a sudden people came out of the woodwork, it was alive again&quot;. Around this time Pandora Cinema offered a $2.5 million production budget, and Schwartzman&#x27;s agent sent the script to Nancy Juvonen, who co-owned Flower Films with actress Drew Barrymore. The pair liked the script and wanted to get involved, which led Kelly and McKittrick to a meeting with the pair in March 2000 on the set of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000), where Barrymore was filming. Barrymore agreed to play as Karen, and Flower Films agreed to increase the budget to $4.5 million. Kelly later called the sum the &quot;bare minimum&quot; to make the film.

After securing enough financial backing, pre-production accelerated and filming was booked for the summer of 2000 and scheduled to accommodate Barrymore, who had just one week&#x27;s availability. However, by July, Schwartzman had withdrawn due to scheduling conflicts. This led to an &quot;exciting&quot; period for Kelly who met several hopefuls, including Patrick Fugit and Lucas Black. Gyllenhaal, who was in Los Angeles auditioning for parts, was &quot;mesmerised&quot; by the script and recalled pulling over the side of the road to finish reading it. Filming was scheduled to start in one month, during which Kelly worked with Gyllenhaal to amend parts of his dialogue. Gyllenhaal was given &quot;a lot of room&quot; to incorporate his own ideas, including making his voice sound like &quot;a child talking to its blanket&quot; when he talks to Frank as he is a source of comfort for Donnie. Gyllenhaal also had the idea to have his real-life sister Maggie star as Elizabeth Darko. Jolene Purdy&#x27;s audition for Cherita was the first of her career. Kelly credits Juvonen for being instrumental for getting Wyle and Swayze on board.

===Design===
Kelly recalled several people showing him drawings of what they thought Frank should look like, describing them like an Easter bunny. He wanted Frank to be &quot;disturbing and animalistic&quot;. He produced initial sketches of Frank&#x27;s face and presented them to production designer Alex Hammond, who then made front and side drawings of the mask and sketches of the full suit. Kelly also said that the 1972 novel &quot;Watership Down&quot; was also the inspiration for Frank. The design was given to costume designer April Ferry who built the costume from scratch and hired a sculptor to create Frank&#x27;s altered grin. Kelly insisted that Frank&#x27;s face had to disturb people and create an intense response with the audience. The costume was first presented to the cast and crew at Loyola High School, shortly after filming began. Although Duval wore the suit for almost every scene, a director stepped in for the initial shoot. Kelly recalled, &quot;Everyone just got quiet [...] like, this is really intense. So I knew it was working, and I felt the sense of relief.&quot; Kelly wanted Frank&#x27;s voice to sound as if he was speaking through liquid and &quot;has the power of the ocean&quot;, and recalled spending a considerable amount of time with the sound designer to achieve the effect on Duval&#x27;s voice.

There was not enough money in the budget for Ferry to dress everyone in 1980s clothing, so she suggested to Kelly that the pupils should wear school uniforms. Kelly agreed, feeling that it would help to portray the idea of Donnie challenging conformity and the educational system.

Kelly chose Steven Poster as cinematographer from going through a stack of resumes and noted Poster had shot &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; (1987) for director Ridley Scott; to Kelly, this meant &quot;you can retire, you made it.&quot; Poster had not shot a feature film in two years, and Kelly had to persuade him to accept the job for a reduced fee. Poster had Kelly dissect the script for him at their initial meeting: &quot;We read every word, every sentence, every page, every scene in the movie. I made him justify to me why he wanted that in the movie. I wanted him to be able to tell me what each scene was going to tell the audience.&quot; Although the task created arguments between them, once complete the pair knew exactly what was needed to make the film. Poster&#x27;s reputation and connections with Panavision allowed Kelly to shoot with &quot;an unprecedented amount&quot; of filming equipment from them at a reduced price. For night time shots, Kelly showed the crew scenes from &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986) for its &quot;idealised ... burnished nostalgia&quot;. The polished cinematography in &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; &quot;creates a feeling of hyper-reality, suggesting that all is not what it seems.&quot;

The film was publicized at the Sundance Film Festival as being the first to feature significant digital effects. Kelly wanted to use them only &quot;when absolutely necessary&quot; and have them relate to the story, such as the water barrier seen between Donnie and Frank in his bathroom. The liquid spears that emerge from people&#x27;s torsos are reminiscent of the water tentacle in &quot;The Abyss&quot; (1989), and can be seen as a representation of a character&#x27;s psyche. Alternatively, they demonstrate the &quot;metaphysical idea of predestination&quot;, suggesting Donnie is being guided, perhaps by God. Kelly got the idea from the on-screen chalkboard that American football commentator John Madden used to illustrate the movements of the players during a replay. Incidentally, the spears first appear when Donnie is watching a football game on television. The school flooding was inspired by a surreal photomontage by Scott Mutter, in which a giant escalator descends into a rough sea.

===Filming===
Filming was completed in 28 days, the same length of time as the film&#x27;s events, in July and August 2000. Most of the film was shot in Long Beach, California; Kelly was uninterested in shooting elsewhere because he wanted to portray a strong suburban feel. The ongoing commercial actors strike had created a shortage of work, so additional actors and crew members willing to work for scale were hired for the film. The golf course scenes were filmed at Virginia Country Club and the school scenes were shot at Loyola High School. The opening scene with Donnie waking up was the first to be filmed; it was shot at sunrise on the Angeles Crest Highway. The theatre marquee was shot at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica. Kelly lost 20 lbs from the stress of filming to a tight schedule, plus the pressure of justifying himself to others that he could direct the film. He openly stated to the actors that he was inexperienced and had no idea how to address them properly, so he talked to them like they were his friends.

Production designer Alex Hammond bought the jet engine used in the film for $10,000. The scene where it falls onto Donnie&#x27;s bedroom was done in one shot. The shell of it was rigged above the set and sent through using an air pressure gun. Poster remembered people telling Kelly that jet engines do not fall off planes, but during production a &quot;dishwasher-sized engine part&quot; fell from the engine of a Boeing 747 and landed on a beach. Swayze frosted his hair specifically for his part and the infomercial clips were filmed at his ranch.

Kelly&#x27;s goal was to &quot;seduce the audience&quot; from the film&#x27;s opening shot. He was attentive to details and spoke to his transportation coordinator to ensure all cars in the film were era-specific. He wanted to avoid going &quot;too kitsch&quot; with the style and costumes and retain a conservative style of the Virginia suburb. The long shots at the school with &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; playing angered the production and line managers at first, who thought it was &quot;an indulgent music video&quot; that lacked dialogue and did nothing to advance the story. Upon viewing the finished sequence, they had changed their minds. Kelly choreographed the scene&#x27;s action to the song before the rights to use it had been acquired. Sparkle Motion&#x27;s performance scene was one of the more difficult shots for Poster, who used smoke to give the appearance that light is there and to achieve silhouettes of the girls on stage.

The film was shot with a Panavision Panastar camera and in anamorphic format, which involves filming in widescreen onto standard 35 mm film. Despite its setbacks and the need to have twice as much light, Kelly was adamant. Poster suggested using Kodak 800 ASA film stock, which people said looked &quot;terrible and grainy&quot;, but he convinced the producers that anamorphic would reduce the amount of work with low ceiling lights that were common in the locations used for filming as they would be cut from the shot. The anamorphic process required Swayze to kneel down for some scenes so he could fit in the image. Early on Kelly made a promise to Sam Bauer that he would edit his first feature film when he had the opportunity, but Pandora Cinema disagreed with the choice initially. Kelly recalled he and McKittrick had to &quot;fight like hell&quot; to get Bauer onboard, and eventually Pandora agreed. The water barrier effects were produced by Kelly Carlton for $5,000.

===Soundtrack===

The film&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by San Diego musician and songwriter Michael Andrews. Kelly knew that the film&#x27;s limited budget prevented him from hiring either &quot;Thomas Newman or Danny Elfman&quot; to compose the score for the film, so he decided to look for a composer who happens to be someone &quot;very young, hungry, and really talented&quot;. Andrews was recommended by Juvonen&#x27;s brother, Jim.

The film&#x27;s opening sequence is set to &quot;The Killing Moon&quot; by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. The continuous shot of introduction of Donnie&#x27;s high school prominently features the song &quot;Head over Heels&quot; by Tears for Fears. Samantha&#x27;s dance group &quot;Sparkle Motion&quot; performs to &quot;Notorious&quot; by Duran Duran. When the scene was originally shot, the group danced to &quot;West End Girls&quot; by Pet Shop Boys. However, the rights to the song could not be obtained for the final release. &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; by The Church is played after Donnie and Gretchen emerge from his bedroom during the party. &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; by Joy Division also appears in the film diegetically during the party and shots of Donnie and Gretchen upstairs. Despite the film being set in 1988, the version played was not released until 1995. In the director&#x27;s cut, the music in the opening sequence is replaced by &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; by INXS; &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; is moved to the scene of Donnie and Eddie driving home from Donnie&#x27;s meeting with his therapist; and &quot;The Killing Moon&quot; is played as Gretchen and Donnie return to the party from Donnie&#x27;s parents&#x27; room.

The film&#x27;s end sequence features a piano-driven cover of &quot;Mad World&quot; by English new wave group Tears for Fears, sung by American musician Gary Jules, a schoolfriend of Andrews. In 2003, the cover of &quot;Mad World&quot; was released as a single that was No. 1 in the United Kingdom for three weeks, during which it was the country&#x27;s Christmas No. 1 of that year.

==Release==
=== Theatrical release ===
&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, on January 19, 2001. Kelly said it took around six months to secure a theatrical release; at one point, he was close to having it on the premium cable and satellite television network Starz. Donnie firing a gun became one of Kelly&#x27;s biggest problems while finding a distributor, as the Columbine High School massacre from 1999 raised concerns of the film promoting teenage suicide. The licensed songs in the film also presented problems as they had yet to be paid for, causing a risk of them being removed for a wide release. Kelly was also advised to cut 30 minutes from the film. Despite the problems, Newmarket Films agreed to buy the film and organise a theatrical release in a service deal with IFC Films. Kelly involved Barrymore in the negotiations and recalled getting her to &quot;beg&quot; Newmarket for a deal, who had initially considered a straight-to-video release for it. Kelly credits Christopher Nolan and his wife Emma Thomas in securing the deal, after &quot;Memento&quot; producer Aaron Ryder arranged a private screening of &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; for Newmarket executives Chris Ball and Will Tyrer and encouraged the pair to distribute it.

With a deal secured, the crew spent the summer of 2001 revisiting the film; Ryder said it was to get the film &quot;in the best possible shape we could&quot;, but recalled the difficulty in the task. This involved an additional day of shooting to clarify some plot holes, such as Ryder&#x27;s suggestion of including shots of Frank in the &quot;Mad World&quot; sequence. Nolan and Thomas had advised Kelly to insert title cards throughout the film to break down the events leading up to October 30, 1988, which he did.

&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; was theatrically released from October 26, 2001, to its peak of 58 theaters across the United States; its premiere was held at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. The film grossed $110,494 on its opening weekend, ranking No. 34 on the box office. The film was released six weeks after the September 11 attacks and its trailer featured an accident involving an aircraft, which affected its chances of box office success. Kelly said the film was not &quot;attractive to people in that emotional, very deeply traumatizing chapter in our history&quot;. Newmarket president Bob Berney said &quot;the bleak mood and the timing&quot; was the cause of the film&#x27;s failure at the box office, and that critics failed to understand or accept the film for what it is. &quot;The mood filtered through everything.&quot; When its theatrical run ended on April 11, 2002, the film had grossed $517,375. After reissues, it went on to gross $7.6 million worldwide, recouping its budget. Despite its initial poor box office showing, the film attracted a devoted fan base and gained a cult following. Following its release on home video in March 2002, the Pioneer Theatre in New York City began midnight screenings of &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; that ran for 28 consecutive months.

====UK release====
In October 2002, the film was released in the UK, which generated renewed critical and commercial interest in the film. It sold 300,000 tickets within the first six weeks of its release, based mostly on word-of-mouth marketing, and grossed the equivalent of $2.5 million in its theatrical run. Its UK distributor Metrodome Distribution organised They Made Me Do It, an art exhibition that ran for 28 days at cafe bar Dream Bags Jaguar Shoes in Shoreditch, London. The project involved several graffiti artists given 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds to complete a work inspired by the film.

=== Book ===
Kelly published &quot;The Donnie Darko Book&quot; in October 2003. Jake Gyllenhaal wrote the foreword, in which he comments on the confusing nature of the film. The book includes an interview with Kelly who discusses the process of making and marketing the film, and questions about his personal life. The full shooting script of the film is included, plus several pages from &quot;The Philosophy of Time Travel&quot; and photographs and concept sketches such as Frank&#x27;s mask and slides from Cunningham&#x27;s school presentation.

=== Promotion ===
The official &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; website, donniedarko.com, which can still be found at http://archive.hi-res.net/donniedarko/ is an interactive experience and marketing tool for the film made by Hi-ReS!, a digital marketing firm. The website is riddled with puzzles and secrets and contains never-before-seen information about the universe of the film, including information about the fate of many of the characters after the film ends. James Beck has commented on the website&#x27;s validity as a narrative in and of itself due to the website&#x27;s introduction of new content while reinforcing themes from the movie like fluidity of time, exemplified by the website&#x27;s lack of concern for the chronology of the movie. Beck further argues that the Donnie Darko website differs from most other promotional websites in that it treats the user not as an outside viewer, but rather as someone within the universe of the film, creating an experience rather than an advertisement.

===Home media===
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film for home video several times. The first was in March 2002 on VHS and DVD formats, of which the latter included bonus material, including audio commentaries, trailers and TV spots, concept art, galleries, and a virtual guide through &quot;The Philosophy of Time&quot;. Berney declared the film &quot;a runaway hit&quot; on DVD, the sales in the US alone brought in over $10 million.

In 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray, containing the theatrical and director&#x27;s cuts. This was released in the UK in 2010. A four-disc set was released in 2011 to commemorate its tenth anniversary. In December 2016, Arrow Films released a limited edition Blu-ray and DVD set in the UK, taken from a new 4K scan of the original print, and supervised and approved by Kelly. It was released in the US in 2017.

In April 2021, Arrow Films released a two-disc Ultra HD Blu-ray box set containing both cuts in 4K resolution restorations from the original negatives, supervised by Kelly and Poster. This set includes a poster, postcards, and a 100-page book.

===Director&#x27;s cut===

The idea to produce a director&#x27;s cut of the film originated in late 2003, when Kelly and Berney attended the first-anniversary screening at the Pioneer Theatre in New York City. &quot;Donnie Darko: The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; premiered on May 29, 2004, at the Seattle International Film Festival, followed by screenings in New York City and Los Angeles on July 23. The tickets sold out within the day for the Seattle International Film Festival premiere, grossing nearly $33,000 over a five-day period. This cut includes 20 minutes of extra footage and an altered soundtrack.

The director&#x27;s cut DVD was released on February 15, 2005, in single- and double-disc versions, the latter being available in a standard DVD case or in a limited edition that also features a lenticular slipcase, whose central image alternates between Donnie and Frank depending on the viewing angle. Most additional features are exclusive to the two-DVD set: the director&#x27;s commentary assisted by Kevin Smith, excerpts from the storyboard, a 52-minute production diary, &quot;#1 fan video&quot;, a &quot;cult following&quot; video interviewing English fans, and the new director&#x27;s cut trailer. The single-DVD edition was also released as a giveaway with copies of the British &quot;Sunday Times&quot; newspaper on February 19, 2006.

The DVD of the Director&#x27;s Cut includes text of the in-universe book, &quot;The Philosophy of Time Travel&quot;, written by Roberta Sparrow, which Donnie is given and reads in the film. The text expands on the philosophical and scientific concepts much of the film&#x27;s plot revolves around, and has been seen as a way to understand the film better than from its theatrical release. As outlined by &quot;Salon&quot;″s Dan Kois from the book&#x27;s text, much of the film takes place in an unstable Tangent Universe that is physically connected to the Primary Universe by a wormhole (the entrance to which is the Vortex seen at the end of the film) and which is an exact duplicate of it, except for an extra metal object known as an Artifact — which in this case is the jet engine. If the Artifact is not sent to the Primary Universe by the chosen Living Receiver (Donnie) within 28 days, the Primary Universe will be destroyed upon the collapse of the Tangent in a black hole. To aid in this task, the Living Receiver is given super-human abilities such as foresight, physical strength and elemental powers, but at the cost of troubling visions and paranoia, while the Manipulated Living (all who live around the Receiver) support him in unnatural ways, setting up a domino-like chain of events encouraging him to return the Artifact. The Manipulated Dead (those who die within the Tangent Universe, like Frank and Gretchen) are more aware than the Living, having the power to travel through time, and will set an Ensurance Trap, a scenario which leaves the Receiver no choice but to save the Primary Universe.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Richard Kelly&#x27;s debut feature &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a daring, original vision, packed with jarring ideas and intelligence and featuring a remarkable performance from Jake Gyllenhaal as the troubled title character.&quot; Metacritic gives the theatrical version of the film a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Andrew Johnson cited the film in &quot;Us Weekly&quot;, as one of the outstanding films at Sundance in 2001, describing it as &quot;a heady blend of science fiction, spirituality, and teen angst&quot;. Jean Oppenheimer of &quot;New Times (LA)&quot; praised the film, saying, &quot;Like gathering storm clouds, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; creates an atmosphere of eerie calm and mounting menace—[and] stands as one of the most exceptional movies of 2001.&quot; Writing for ABC Australia, Megan Spencer called the movie &quot;menacing, dreamy and exciting&quot; and noted &quot;it could take you to a deeply emotional place lying dormant in your soul&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the theatrical version of the film two and a half stars out of four, but later gave the director&#x27;s cut three stars out of four.

Other critics like Sam Adams called the movie an apparent &quot;big mess&quot;, citing incoherent plot, sloppy writing, and an uneven tone. Adams also took issue with the &quot;seemingly irrelevant&quot; but oft-referenced setting in a suburban America in the 1980s, claiming that it &quot;serves as another example of the movie&#x27;s struggle to find identity&quot;. Another review from the &quot;San Antonio Current&quot; lauds the build-up, citing vast build of mysteries with compelling characters, but claims the movie&#x27;s ending &quot;leaves much to be desired&quot;, calling it cheap and anti-climactic. The film has been praised for its 1980s nostalgia.

==Sequels==
===&quot;S. Darko&quot;===

A 2009 sequel, &quot;S. Darko&quot;, set seven years afterwards, centers on the now 18-year-old Sam, Donnie&#x27;s younger sister. Sam is troubled by her brother&#x27;s death and begins to have problems with sleepwalking, along with strange dreams that hint at an impending major catastrophe. The sequel received extremely negative reviews. Kelly said he had no involvement in the sequel as he no longer owns the rights to the original. In 2017, Kelly said that he resents being asked about the sequel and that he had never seen it. Actress Daveigh Chase and producer Adam Fields were the only creative links between &quot;S. Darko&quot; and the original film.

===New sequel===
In 2017, Kelly revealed that he had ideas for a new sequel that is &quot;much bigger and more ambitious&quot; than the original. In January 2021, he announced that &quot;an enormous amount of work&quot; had been done on the script. He was inspired to do so after a 2010 meeting with James Cameron, who found the film “disturbing” and had Kelly explain what happened to Donnie at the end of the film. Cameron suggested to Kelly that he continue working on the project, which made Kelly realize that &quot;there was really something big, something epic that could be done.&quot;

==In other media==
Marcus Stern, associate director of the American Repertory Theater, directed a stage adaptation of &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; at the Zero Arrow Theatre, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the fall of 2007. It ran from October 27 until November 18, 2007, with opening night scheduled near Halloween.

An article written by the production drama team says the director and production team planned to &quot;embrace the challenge to make the fantastical elements come alive on stage&quot;. In 2004, Stern adapted and directed Kelly&#x27;s screenplay for a graduate student production at the American Repertory Theater&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Theater Training (I.A.T.T./M.X.A.T.).

A playable skin based on Frank was released in &quot;Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War&quot; in October 2021.

<text>Wireless Markup Language (WML), based on XML, is an obsolete markup language intended for devices that implement the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) specification, such as mobile phones. It provides navigational support, data input, hyperlinks, text and image presentation, and forms, much like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It preceded the use of other markup languages used with WAP, such as XHTML and HTML itself, which achieved dominance as processing power in mobile devices increased.

==WML history==

Building on Openwave&#x27;s HDML, Nokia&#x27;s &quot;Tagged Text Markup Language&quot; (TTML) and Ericsson&#x27;s proprietary markup language for mobile content, the WAP Forum created the WML 1.1 standard in 1998. WML 2.0 was specified in 2001, but has not been widely adopted. It was an attempt at bridging WML and XHTML Basic before the WAP 2.0 spec was finalized. In the end, XHTML Mobile Profile became the markup language used in WAP 2.0. The newest WML version in active use is 1.3.

The first company to launch a public WML site was Dutch mobile phone network operator Telfort in October 1999 and the first company in the world to launch the Nokia 7110. The Telfort WML site was created and developed as side project to test the device&#x27;s capabilities by a billing engineer called Christopher Bee and National Deployment Manager, Euan McLeod. The WML site consists of four pages in both Dutch and English that contained many grammatical errors in Dutch as the two developers were unaware the WML was configured on the Nokia 7110 as the home page and neither were native Dutch speakers.

==WML markup==
WML documents are XML documents that validate against the WML DTD (Document Type Definition)
. The W3C Markup Validation service (http://validator.w3.org/) can be used to validate WML documents (they are validated against their declared document type).

For example, the following WML page could be saved as &quot;example.wml&quot;:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN&quot;
 &quot;http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml&quot; &gt;
&lt;wml&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;card id=&quot;main&quot; title=&quot;First Card&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p mode=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt;This is a sample WML page.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/card&gt;
&lt;/wml&gt;
A WML document is known as a &quot;deck&quot;. Data in the deck is structured into one or more &quot;cards&quot; (pages), each of which represents a single interaction with the user.

WML decks are stored on an ordinary web server configured to serve the text/vnd.wap.wml MIME type in addition to plain HTML and variants. The WML cards when requested by a device are accessed by a bridge (WAP gateway), which sits between mobile devices and the World Wide Web, passing pages from one to the other much like a proxy. The gateways send the WML pages on in a form suitable for mobile device reception (WAP Binary XML). This process is hidden from the phone, so it may access the page in the same way as a browser accesses HTML, using a URL (for example, http://example.com/foo.wml). (Provided the mobile phone operator has not specifically locked the phone to prevent access of user-specified URLs.)

WML has a scaled-down set of procedural elements, which can be used by the author to control navigation to other cards.

Mobile devices are moving towards allowing more XHTML and even standard HTML as processing power in handsets increases. These standards are concerned with formatting and presentation. They do not however address cell-phone or mobile device hardware interfacing in the same way as WML.

== WML capability in desktop browsers ==

The Presto layout engine (used by Opera before its switch to Blink) understood WML natively. Mozilla-based browsers (Firefox (before version 57), SeaMonkey, MicroB) could interpret WML through the WMLBrowser add-on. Google Chrome can also interpret WML via two extensions: WML and FireMobileSimulator.

<text>Benton County is a county in the south-central portion of the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, its population was 206,873. The county seat is Prosser, and its most populous city is Kennewick. The Columbia River demarcates the county&#x27;s north, south, and east boundaries.

Benton County was created from what were then larger versions of Klickitat County and Yakima County on March 8, 1905, and was named after Missouri statesman Thomas Hart Benton.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.4%) is water. The highest point of land elevation within the county is the summit of Rattlesnake Mountain at 3,527 feet; and the lowest point of land elevation is along the southwestern shore of Crow Butte at 265 feet (fluctuates due to level of Columbia River).

===Waterways===
*Columbia River - Surrounds and forms the county&#x27;s boundary on three sides. Barge trafficking is possible upriver to anchorage sites in northern Richland, the upstream extent of Lake Wallula which forms behind McNary Dam.
*Yakima River - Bisects the county from west to east, emptying into the Columbia River at Richland. As a water source, the Yakima is the lifesource for agriculture in the Yakima Valley. A shallow river, the Yakima is suitably navigable only for small, personal watercraft. Historically, the Yakima River supported some of the most bountiful migratory fish populations in the entire Columbia Basin, and many of those legendary salmon runs are now rebounding after decades of demise. Amon Creek is the most notable tributary of the Yakima River in Benton County, emptying into the mainstem river near the Yakima River Delta in Richland.

==Government==
Benton County is one of the 33 counties in Washington that operates under the non-chartered &quot;commission&quot; or &quot;plural executive&quot; form of government. Three commissioners share administrative aegis with several other partisan officials independently elected to four-year terms of office. Judges of the superior court are also independently elected. In Benton County, the commissioners appoint a county administrator to oversee all departments that do not fall under other elected officials.
*Commissioner (District 1) - Jerome Delvin
*Commissioner (District 2) - Michael Alvarez
*Commissioner (District 3) - Will McKay

The County government is seated in Prosser, with many departments having satellite and auxiliary offices and facilities in Richland, Kennewick, and elsewhere. An attempt to move the county seat from Prosser to Kennewick resulted in a November 1984 ballot measure, which had 54.4 percent approval but failed to meet the required 60 percent threshold.

There are five incorporated cities within Benton County. The two larger cities—Kennewick and Richland—employ the &quot;council-manager&quot; form of government where the mayor is elected from the city council and serves a more ceremonial role, whereby direct administration of the city is the responsibility of the city manager. The three smaller cities—Benton City, Prosser, and West Richland—use the &quot;mayor-council&quot; form of government where the mayor is the chief administrator of the city and is directly elected by the citizens. In Washington, a majority of cities use the mayor-council form, but the council-manager structure is common among medium-sized municipalities.

Numerous special purpose districts with varying degrees of taxing and administrative authority such as port authorities and school districts oversee local responsibilities that are not a part of county or city governance.
==Politics==











==Education==
Benton County is serviced by six public school districts and a few smaller private schools.

===Public education===
Delta High School, located in Pasco, is a public high school specializing in the &quot;STEM&quot; fields of study (science, technology, engineering, mathematics). Delta High School is a collaborative venture of the Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland school districts, and is located in neighboring Franklin County, Washington. Prosser High School is located much closer to the county seat of Benton County.

===Higher education===
Two public college branch campuses are located in Benton County, each in Richland:
*Columbia Basin College - CBC is a community college conferring associates, transfer, and baccalaureate degrees with its main campus located in Pasco and a branch campus co-located with Delta High School in central Richland.
*Washington State University Tri-Cities - WSUTC is a branch of the Washington State University system based in Pullman, with a growing campus located in North Richland near the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

==Recreation==
The Tri-City area&#x27;s favorable climate, generally lower costs of living, and central location within a four-hour drive of the Seattle, Portland, Boise, and Spokane metropolitan areas has made it a popular destination for conferences, sports tournaments, festivals, agri-tourism, and other attractions.

===Golf courses===
Benton County is home to seven publicly accessible golf courses:
*Canyon Lakes (Kennewick) – 7,026 yards | 73.8 / 131
*Columbia Park (Kennewick) – 2,447 yards | note: &quot;par 3&quot;
*Zintel Creek Golf Club (Kennewick) – 4,900 yards | 63.9 / 115 | note: semi-private
*Buckskin (Richland) - note: 9 holes
*Columbia Point (Richland) – 6,571 yards | 71.2 / 128 | note: municipal
*Horn Rapids (Richland) – 7,060 yards | 74.0 / 139
*West Richland (West Richland) – 6,014 yards
A private golf and country club, Meadow Springs, is also located in Richland.

===Museums===
* Benton County Historical Museum
* East Benton County Historical Museum
* Hanford Reach Interpretive Center

===Sports===
The Tri-City Americans are a major junior hockey team and are a founding member of the Western Hockey League and play at the Toyota Center. The Americans began as the Calgary Buffaloes in 1966, and after stints in Billings, Nanaimo, and New Westminster, moved to the Tri-Cities for the 1988–89 season where they were rebranded as the &quot;Americans&quot;. Players are 16–20 years old and are generally considered to have amateur status, though they do receive nominal compensation and the organization is operated as a for-profit business.

===Public lands===

Like many Western counties, Benton County is home to considerable public lands acreage totaling about one-third of the county&#x27;s total land area. The most significant holding is the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s Hanford Site, most of which has restricted public access. However, Hanford does have a strong &quot;nuclear tourism&quot; element and certain Site facilities, such as the B Reactor, are a major attraction for history and engineering buffs. Part of the Hanford Site acreage is also part of the Hanford Reach National Monument, which was established in 2000 by presidential proclamation. Like with most of the rest of Hanford, most of the National Monument within Benton County is restricted from general public use.

Other federal land holdings in the county include small clusters of Bureau of Land Management, notably an aggregation along the Horse Heaven Hills south of Benton City that is popular with hikers; Fish and Wildlife Service-owned islands and shorelands that are parts of the Umatilla and McNary National Wildlife Refugues; and Army Corps of Engineers properties along the Columbia River, most of which are managed for habitat and recreation by the County and cities.

State-owned public lands are minimal in Benton County, with the Department of Fish and Wildlife&#x27;s Rattlesnake Slope Wildlife Recreation Area north of Benton City being the most significant and a draw for hikers and equestrians.

Benton County and the cities also own numerous parklands and open spaces, most notable the Badger Mountain Centennial Preserve, a hiking destination managed by the County located south of Richland which draws over 200,000 visits per year.

===Viticulture===
The area of south-central Washington occupied by Benton County has been known primarily as an agricultural hub since its settlement. The rise of viticulture has had a profound impact on the agricultural and tourism industries over the past two decades, and has in many ways reshaped the reputation of the region.

The Yakima Valley AVA, part of which is located in Benton County, was the first American Viticultural Area established within Washington state, gaining the recognition in 1983. As the Washington wine industry began to focus more on &quot;terroir&quot;, three sub-appellations have been created for areas within the Yakima Valley AVA that demonstrate unique microclimates and soil conditions which crafted different wines from their neighboring areas. The Red Mountain AVA, which lies in its entirety on Benton County, was created in 2001. The county also includes part of the Horse Heaven Hills AVA which is part of the larger Columbia Valley AVA.

<text>In mathematical analysis, semicontinuity (or semi-continuity) is a property of extended real-valued functions that is weaker than continuity. An extended real-valued function formula_1 is upper (respectively, lower) semicontinuous at a point formula_2 if, roughly speaking, the function values for arguments near formula_2 are not much higher (respectively, lower) than formula_4 Briefly, a function on a domain formula_5 is lower semi-continuous if its epigraph formula_6 is closed in formula_7, and upper semi-continuous if formula_8 is lower semi-continuous.

A function is continuous if and only if it is both upper and lower semicontinuous. If we take a continuous function and increase its value at a certain point formula_2 to formula_10 for some formula_11, then the result is upper semicontinuous; if we decrease its value to formula_12 then the result is lower semicontinuous.

The notion of upper and lower semicontinuous function was first introduced and studied by René Baire in his thesis in 1899.

== Definitions ==

Assume throughout that formula_5 is a topological space and formula_14 is a function with values in the extended real numbers formula_15.

=== Upper semicontinuity ===

A function formula_14 is called upper semicontinuous at a point formula_17 if for every real formula_18 there exists a neighborhood formula_19 of formula_2 such that formula_21 for all formula_22.
Equivalently, formula_1 is upper semicontinuous at formula_2 if and only if
formula_25
where lim sup is the limit superior of the function formula_1 at the point formula_27

If formula_5 is a metric space with distance function formula_29 and formula_30 this can also be restated using an formula_31-formula_32 formulation, similar to the definition of continuous function. Namely, for each formula_33 there is a formula_34 such that formula_35 whenever formula_36

A function formula_14 is called upper semicontinuous if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:
:(1) The function is upper semicontinuous at every point of its domain.
:(2) For each formula_38, the set formula_39 is open in formula_5, where formula_41.
:(3) For each formula_38, the formula_43-superlevel set formula_44 is closed in formula_5.
:(4) The hypograph formula_46 is closed in formula_7.
:(5) The function formula_1 is continuous when the codomain formula_49 is given the left order topology. This is just a restatement of condition (2) since the left order topology is generated by all the intervals formula_50.

=== Lower semicontinuity ===

A function formula_14 is called lower semicontinuous at a point formula_52 if for every real formula_53 there exists a neighborhood formula_19 of formula_2 such that formula_56 for all formula_22.
Equivalently, formula_1 is lower semicontinuous at formula_2 if and only if
formula_60
where formula_61 is the limit inferior of the function formula_1 at point formula_27

If formula_5 is a metric space with distance function formula_29 and formula_30 this can also be restated as follows: For each formula_33 there is a formula_34 such that formula_69 whenever formula_36

A function formula_14 is called lower semicontinuous if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:
:(1) The function is lower semicontinuous at every point of its domain.
:(2) For each formula_38, the set formula_73 is open in formula_5, where formula_75.
:(3) For each formula_38, the formula_43-sublevel set formula_78 is closed in formula_5.
:(4) The epigraph formula_6 is closed in formula_7.
:(5) The function formula_1 is continuous when the codomain formula_49 is given the right order topology. This is just a restatement of condition (2) since the right order topology is generated by all the intervals formula_84.

== Examples ==
Consider the function formula_85 piecewise defined by:
formula_86
This function is upper semicontinuous at formula_87 but not lower semicontinuous.

The floor function formula_88 which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to a given real number formula_89 is everywhere upper semicontinuous. Similarly, the ceiling function formula_90 is lower semicontinuous.

Upper and lower semicontinuity bear no relation to continuity from the left or from the right for functions of a real variable. Semicontinuity is defined in terms of an ordering in the range of the functions, not in the domain. For example the function
formula_91
is upper semicontinuous at formula_92 while the function limits from the left or right at zero do not even exist.

If formula_93 is a Euclidean space (or more generally, a metric space) and formula_94 is the space of curves in formula_5 (with the supremum distance formula_96), then the length functional formula_97 which assigns to each curve formula_98 its length formula_99 is lower semicontinuous. As an example, consider approximating the unit square diagonal by a staircase from below. The staircase always has length 2, while the diagonal line has only length formula_100.

Let formula_101 be a measure space and let formula_102 denote the set of positive measurable functions endowed with the
topology of convergence in measure with respect to formula_103 Then by Fatou&#x27;s lemma the integral, seen as an operator from formula_102 to formula_105 is lower semicontinuous.

Tonelli&#x27;s theorem in functional analysis characterizes the weak lower semicontinuity of nonlinear functionals on &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; spaces in terms of the convexity of another function.

== Properties ==

Unless specified otherwise, all functions below are from a topological space formula_5 to the extended real numbers formula_107 Several of the results hold for semicontinuity at a specific point, but for brevity they are only stated for semicontinuity over the whole domain.

* A function formula_14 is continuous if and only if it is both upper and lower semicontinuous.
* The characteristic function or indicator function of a set formula_109 (defined by formula_110 if formula_111 and formula_112 if formula_113) is upper semicontinuous if and only if formula_114 is a closed set. It is lower semicontinuous if and only if formula_114 is an open set.
* In the field of convex analysis, the characteristic function of a set formula_116 is defined differently, as formula_117 if formula_111 and formula_119 if formula_113. With that definition, the characteristic function of any is lower semicontinuous, and the characteristic function of any is upper semicontinuous.

=== Binary Operations on Semicontinuous Functions ===
Let formula_121.
* If formula_1 and formula_123 are lower semicontinuous, then the sum formula_124 is lower semicontinuous (provided the sum is well-defined, i.e., formula_125 is not the indeterminate form formula_126). The same holds for upper semicontinuous functions.
* If formula_1 and formula_123 are lower semicontinuous and non-negative, then the product function formula_129 is lower semicontinuous. The corresponding result holds for upper semicontinuous functions.
* The function formula_1 is lower semicontinuous if and only if formula_8 is upper semicontinuous.
* If formula_1 and formula_123 are upper semicontinuous and formula_1 is non-decreasing, then the composition formula_135 is upper semicontinuous. On the other hand, if formula_1 is not non-decreasing, then formula_135 may not be upper semicontinuous.
* If formula_1 and formula_123 are lower semicontinuous, their (pointwise) maximum and minimum (defined by formula_140 and formula_141) are also lower semicontinuous. Consequently, the set of all lower semicontinuous functions from formula_5 to formula_49 (or to formula_144) forms a lattice. The corresponding statements also hold for upper semicontinuous functions.

=== Optimization of Semicontinuous Functions ===

* The (pointwise) supremum of an arbitrary family formula_145 of lower semicontinuous functions formula_146 (defined by formula_147) is lower semicontinuous.

:In particular, the limit of a monotone increasing sequence formula_148 of continuous functions is lower semicontinuous. (The Theorem of Baire below provides a partial converse.) The limit function will only be lower semicontinuous in general, not continuous. An example is given by the functions formula_149 defined for formula_150 for formula_151

:Likewise, the infimum of an arbitrary family of upper semicontinuous functions is upper semicontinuous. And the limit of a monotone decreasing sequence of continuous functions is upper semicontinuous.

* If formula_152 is a compact space (for instance a closed bounded interval formula_153) and formula_154 is upper semicontinuous, then formula_1 attains a maximum on formula_156 If formula_1 is lower semicontinuous on formula_158 it attains a minimum on formula_156
:(&quot;Proof for the upper semicontinuous case&quot;: By condition (5) in the definition, formula_1 is continuous when formula_49 is given the left order topology. So its image formula_162 is compact in that topology. And the compact sets in that topology are exactly the sets with a maximum. For an alternative proof, see the article on the extreme value theorem.)

=== Other Properties ===

* (Theorem of Baire) Let formula_5 be a metric space. Every lower semicontinuous function formula_14 is the limit of a point-wise increasing sequence of extended real-valued continuous functions on formula_165 In particular, there exists a sequence formula_166 of continuous functions formula_167 such that 
:formula_168 and 
:formula_169
:If formula_1 does not take the value formula_171, the continuous functions can be taken to be real-valued.

:Additionally, every upper semicontinuous function formula_14 is the limit of a monotone decreasing sequence of extended real-valued continuous functions on formula_173 if formula_1 does not take the value formula_175 the continuous functions can be taken to be real-valued.

* Any upper semicontinuous function formula_176 on an arbitrary topological space formula_5 is locally constant on some dense open subset of formula_165

* If the topological space formula_5 is sequential, then formula_180 is upper semi-continuous if and only if it is sequentially upper semi-continuous, that is, if for any formula_181 and any sequence formula_182 that converges towards formula_183, there holds formula_184. Equivalently, in a sequential space, formula_1 is upper semicontinuous if and only if its superlevel sets formula_186 are sequentially closed for all formula_187. In general, upper semicontinuous functions are sequentially upper semicontinuous, but the converse may be false.

== Semicontinuity of Set-valued Functions ==
For set-valued functions, several concepts of semicontinuity have been defined, namely &quot;upper&quot;, &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;outer&quot;, and &quot;inner&quot; semicontinuity, as well as &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower hemicontinuity&quot;.
A set-valued function formula_188 from a set formula_114 to a set formula_190 is written formula_191 For each formula_192 the function formula_188 defines a set formula_194
The preimage of a set formula_195 under formula_188 is defined as 
formula_197
That is, formula_198 is the set that contains every point formula_183 in formula_114 such that formula_201 is not disjoint from formula_202.

=== Upper and Lower Semicontinuity ===

A set-valued map formula_203 is &quot;upper semicontinuous&quot; at formula_204 if for every open set formula_205 such that formula_206, there exists a neighborhood formula_207 of formula_183 such that formula_209

A set-valued map formula_203 is &quot;lower semicontinuous&quot; at formula_204 if for every open set formula_205 such that formula_213 there exists a neighborhood formula_207 of formula_183 such that formula_216

Upper and lower set-valued semicontinuity are also defined more generally for a set-valued maps between topological spaces by replacing formula_217 and formula_218 in the above definitions with arbitrary topological spaces.

Note, that there is not a direct correspondence between single-valued lower and upper semicontinuity and set-valued lower and upper semicontinuouty. 
An upper semicontinuous single-valued function is not necessarily upper semicontinuous when considered as a set-valued map. 
For example, the function formula_219 defined by 
formula_86
is upper semicontinuous in the single-valued sense but the set-valued map formula_221 is not upper semicontinuous in the set-valued sense. 
=== Inner and Outer Semicontinuity ===

A set-valued function formula_203 is called &quot;inner semicontinuous&quot; at formula_183 if for every formula_224 and every convergent sequence formula_225 in formula_217 such that formula_227, there exists 
a sequence formula_228 in formula_218 such that formula_230 and formula_231 for all sufficiently large formula_232

A set-valued function formula_203 is called &quot;outer semicontinuous&quot; at formula_183 if for every convergence sequence formula_225 in formula_217 such that formula_227 and every convergent sequence formula_228 in formula_218 such that formula_240 for each formula_241 the sequence formula_228 converges to a point in formula_201 (that is, formula_244).

<text>Stephen Baxter (born 13 November 1957) is an English hard science fiction author. He has degrees in mathematics and engineering.

== Writing style ==
Strongly influenced by science fiction pioneer H. G. Wells, Baxter has been vice-president of the international H. G. Wells Society since 2006. His fiction falls into three main categories of original work plus a fourth category, extending other authors&#x27; writing; each has a different basis, style, and tone.

Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Future History&quot; mode is based on research into hard science. It encompasses the &quot;Xeelee Sequence&quot;, which consists of nine novels (including the &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Children&quot; trilogy and Vengeance/Redemption duology that is set in alternate timeline), plus three volumes collecting the 52 short pieces (short stories and novellas) in the series, all of which fit into a single timeline stretching from the Big Bang singularity of the past to his &quot;Timelike Infinity&quot; (1993) singularity of the future. These stories begin in the present day and end when the Milky Way galaxy collides with Andromeda five billion years in the future. The central narrative is that of humanity rising and evolving to become the second most powerful race in the universe, next to the god-like Xeelee. Character development tends to be secondary to the depiction of advanced theories and ideas, such as the true nature of the Great Attractor, naked singularities and the great battle between baryonic and dark matter lifeforms. The &quot;Manifold Trilogy&quot; is another example of Baxter&#x27;s future history mode, even more conceptual than the Xeelee sequence. Each novel is focused on a potential explanation of the Fermi paradox. The two-part disaster series &quot;Flood&quot; and &quot;Ark&quot; (followed by three additional stories, &quot;Earth III,&quot; &quot;Earth II,&quot; and &quot;Earth I&quot;) which also fits into this category, where catastrophic events unfold in the near future and humanity must adapt to survive in three radically different planetary environments. In 2013, Baxter released his short story collection &quot;Universes&quot; which featured stories set in Flood/Ark, Jones &amp; Bennet and Anti-Ice universes. Baxter signed a contract for two new books, &quot;Proxima&quot; and &quot;Ultima&quot;, both of which are names of planets, and they were released in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

A second category in Baxter&#x27;s work is based on readings in evolutionary biology and human/animal behaviour. Elements of this appear in his future histories (especially later works like the &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Children&quot; series and &quot;Flood&quot;/&quot;Ark&quot;), but here it is the focus. The major work in this category is &quot;Evolution&quot;, which imagines the evolution of humanity in the Earth&#x27;s past and future. &quot;The Mammoth Trilogy&quot;, written for young adults, shares similar themes and concerns as it explores the present, past, and future of a small herd of mammoths found surviving on an island in the Arctic Ocean.

A third category of Baxter&#x27;s fiction is alternate history, based on research into history. These stories are more human, with characters portrayed with greater depth and care. This includes his &quot;NASA Trilogy&quot;, which incorporates research into NASA and its history; and the &quot;Time&#x27;s Tapestry&quot; series, which features science-fictional interventions into our past from an alternate-history future. The novel &quot;Anti-Ice&quot; is an earlier example of Baxter&#x27;s blending of alternate history with science fiction. A more recent work in this direction is the &quot;Northland Trilogy&quot;, an alternate prehistory that begins with &quot;Stone Spring&quot;, set ten thousand years ago in the Stone Age, followed by &quot;Bronze Summer&quot; and &quot;Iron Winter&quot;, set in alternate versions of the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. In 2009, Baxter became a judge for the Sidewise Award for Alternate History, the first former winner among the panel.

Another category, outside of the main body of Baxter&#x27;s independent work, is sequels and installments of science-fiction classics. His first novel to achieve wide recognition (winning three literary awards) was &quot;The Time Ships&quot;, an authorised sequel to H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. The &quot;Time Odyssey&quot; series, a trilogy co-authored with Arthur C. Clarke, is connected to Clarke&#x27;s four &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; novels. The trilogy consists of &quot;Time&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;Sunstorm&quot;, and &quot;Firstborn&quot;. Another novel is based on a synopsis written by Clarke, &quot;The Light of Other Days&quot;. Baxter has also published a Doctor Who novel, &quot;The Wheel of Ice&quot;. His most recent sequel is &quot;The Massacre of Mankind&quot;, an authorised sequel to H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.

In 2010, Baxter began working on a new series with Terry Pratchett. This collaboration produced five books, &quot;The Long Earth&quot;, &quot;The Long War&quot;, &quot;The Long Mars&quot;, &quot;The Long Utopia&quot; and &quot;The Long Cosmos&quot;.

Baxter has written non-fiction essays and columns for such publications as &quot;Critical Wave&quot; and the British SF Association&#x27;s &quot;Matrix&quot;.

==Literary awards==

Baxter&#x27;s story &quot;Last Contact&quot; was nominated for the 2008 Hugo Award for best short story.

==Personal life==
Baxter was born 13 November 1957 in Liverpool, England, and studied at St Edward&#x27;s College, a Catholic grammar school. He then read mathematics at University of Cambridge, and obtained a doctorate in engineering at University of Southampton, and received an MBA from Henley Management College. Baxter taught maths, physics, and information technology before becoming a full-time author in 1995. He is also a chartered engineer and fellow of the British Interplanetary Society.

<doc id="57829" wikidata="Q309396" url="?curid=57829" title="Keystroke logging">
<text>Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program. A keystroke recorder or keylogger can be either software or hardware.

While the programs themselves are legal, with many designed to allow employers to oversee the use of their computers, keyloggers are most often used for stealing passwords and other confidential information. Keystroke logging can also be utilized to monitor activities of children in schools or at home and by law enforcement officials to investigate malicious usage.

Keylogging can also be used to study keystroke dynamics or human-computer interaction. Numerous keylogging methods exist, ranging from hardware and software-based approaches to acoustic cryptanalysis.

== History ==
In the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union developed and deployed a hardware keylogger targeting typewriters. Termed the &quot;selectric bug&quot;, it measured the movements of the print head of IBM Selectric typewriters via subtle influences on the regional magnetic field caused by the rotation and movements of the print head. An early keylogger was written by Perry Kivolowitz and posted to the Usenet newsgroup net.unix-wizards, net.sources on November 17, 1983. The posting seems to be a motivating factor in restricting access to codice_1 on Unix systems. The user-mode program operated by locating and dumping character lists (clients) as they were assembled in the Unix kernel.

In the 1970s, spies installed keystroke loggers in the US Embassy and Consulate buildings in Moscow.
They installed the bugs in Selectric II and Selectric III electric typewriters.

Soviet embassies used manual typewriters, rather than electric typewriters, for classified information—apparently because they are immune to such bugs.
As of 2013, Russian special services still use typewriters.

== Application of keylogger ==
=== Software-based keyloggers ===
A software-based keylogger is a computer program designed to record any input from the keyboard. Keyloggers are used in IT organizations to troubleshoot technical problems with computers and business networks. Families and businesspeople use keyloggers legally to monitor network usage without their users&#x27; direct knowledge. Microsoft publicly stated that Windows 10 has a built-in keylogger in its final version &quot;to improve typing and writing services&quot;. However, malicious individuals can use keyloggers on public computers to steal passwords or credit card information. Most keyloggers are not stopped by HTTPS encryption because that only protects data in transit between computers; software-based keyloggers run on the affected user&#x27;s computer, reading keyboard inputs directly as the user types.

From a technical perspective, there are several categories:

* Hypervisor-based: The keylogger can theoretically reside in a malware hypervisor running underneath the operating system, which thus remains untouched. It effectively becomes a virtual machine. Blue Pill is a conceptual example.
* Kernel-based: A program on the machine obtains root access to hide in the OS and intercepts keystrokes that pass through the kernel. This method is difficult both to write and to combat. Such keyloggers reside at the kernel level, which makes them difficult to detect, especially for user-mode applications that do not have root access. They are frequently implemented as rootkits that subvert the operating system kernel to gain unauthorized access to the hardware. This makes them very powerful. A keylogger using this method can act as a keyboard device driver, for example, and thus gain access to any information typed on the keyboard as it goes to the operating system.
* API-based: These keyloggers hook keyboard APIs inside a running application. The keylogger registers keystroke events as if it was a normal piece of the application instead of malware. The keylogger receives an event each time the user presses or releases a key. The keylogger simply records it. 
** Windows APIs such as codice_2, codice_3, etc. are used to poll the state of the keyboard or to subscribe to keyboard events. A more recent example simply polls the BIOS for pre-boot authentication PINs that have not been cleared from memory.
* Form grabbing based: Form grabbing-based keyloggers log Web form submissions by recording the form data on submit events. This happens when the user completes a form and submits it, usually by clicking a button or pressing enter. This type of keylogger records form data before it is passed over the Internet.
* JavaScript-based: A malicious script tag is injected into a targeted web page, and listens for key events such as codice_4. Scripts can be injected via a variety of methods, including cross-site scripting, man-in-the-browser, man-in-the-middle, or a compromise of the remote website.
* Memory-injection-based: Memory Injection (MitB)-based keyloggers perform their logging function by altering the memory tables associated with the browser and other system functions. By patching the memory tables or injecting directly into memory, this technique can be used by malware authors to bypass Windows UAC (User Account Control). The Zeus and SpyEye trojans use this method exclusively. Non-Windows systems have protection mechanisms that allow access to locally recorded data from a remote location. Remote communication may be achieved when one of these methods is used:
** Data is uploaded to a website, database or an FTP server.
** Data is periodically emailed to a pre-defined email address.
** Data is wirelessly transmitted employing an attached hardware system.
** The software enables a remote login to the local machine from the Internet or the local network, for data logs stored on the target machine.

==== Keystroke logging in writing process research ====
Since 2006, keystroke logging has been an established research method for the study of writing processes. Different programs have been developed to collect online process data of writing activities, including Inputlog, Scriptlog, Translog and GGXLog.

Keystroke logging is used legitimately as a suitable research instrument in several writing contexts. These include studies on cognitive writing processes, which include
* descriptions of writing strategies; the writing development of children (with and without writing difficulties),
* spelling,
* first and second language writing, and
* specialist skill areas such as translation and subtitling.
Keystroke logging can be used to research writing, specifically. It can also be integrated into educational domains for second language learning, programming skills, and typing skills.

==== Related features ====
Software keyloggers may be augmented with features that capture user information without relying on keyboard key presses as the sole input. Some of these features include:

* Clipboard logging. Anything that has been copied to the clipboard can be captured by the program.
* Screen logging. Screenshots are taken to capture graphics-based information. Applications with screen logging abilities may take screenshots of the whole screen, of just one application, or even just around the mouse cursor. They may take these screenshots periodically or in response to user behaviors (for example, when a user clicks the mouse). Screen logging can be used to capture data inputted with an on-screen keyboard.
* Programmatically capturing the text in a control. The Microsoft Windows API allows programs to request the text &#x27;value&#x27; in some controls. This means that some passwords may be captured, even if they are hidden behind password masks (usually asterisks).
* The recording of every program/folder/window opened including a screenshot of every website visited.
* The recording of search engines queries, instant messenger conversations, FTP downloads and other Internet-based activities (including the bandwidth used).

=== Hardware-based keyloggers ===

Hardware-based keyloggers do not depend upon any software being installed as they exist at a hardware level in a computer system.

* Firmware-based: BIOS-level firmware that handles keyboard events can be modified to record these events as they are processed. Physical and/or root-level access is required to the machine, and the software loaded into the BIOS needs to be created for the specific hardware that it will be running on.
* Keyboard hardware: Hardware keyloggers are used for keystroke logging utilizing a hardware circuit that is attached somewhere in between the computer keyboard and the computer, typically inline with the keyboard&#x27;s cable connector. There are also USB connector-based hardware keyloggers, as well as ones for laptop computers (the Mini-PCI card plugs into the expansion slot of a laptop). More stealthy implementations can be installed or built into standard keyboards so that no device is visible on the external cable. Both types log all keyboard activity to their internal memory, which can be subsequently accessed, for example, by typing in a secret key sequence. Hardware keyloggers do not require any software to be installed on a target user&#x27;s computer, therefore not interfering with the computer&#x27;s operation and less likely to be detected by software running on it. However, its physical presence may be detected if, for example, it is installed outside the case as an inline device between the computer and the keyboard. Some of these implementations can be controlled and monitored remotely using a wireless communication standard.
*Wireless keyboard and mouse sniffers: These passive sniffers collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver. As encryption may be used to secure the wireless communications between the two devices, this may need to be cracked beforehand if the transmissions are to be read. In some cases, this enables an attacker to type arbitrary commands into a victim&#x27;s computer.
*Keyboard overlays: Criminals have been known to use keyboard overlays on ATMs to capture people&#x27;s PINs. Each keypress is registered by the keyboard of the ATM as well as the criminal&#x27;s keypad that is placed over it. The device is designed to look like an integrated part of the machine so that bank customers are unaware of its presence.
*Acoustic keyloggers: Acoustic cryptanalysis can be used to monitor the sound created by someone typing on a computer. Each key on the keyboard makes a subtly different acoustic signature when struck. It is then possible to identify which keystroke signature relates to which keyboard character via statistical methods such as frequency analysis. The repetition frequency of similar acoustic keystroke signatures, the timings between different keyboard strokes and other context information such as the probable language in which the user is writing are used in this analysis to map sounds to letters. A fairly long recording (1000 or more keystrokes) is required so that a large enough sample is collected.
*Electromagnetic emissions: It is possible to capture the electromagnetic emissions of a wired keyboard from up to away, without being physically wired to it. In 2009, Swiss researchers tested 11 different USB, PS/2 and laptop keyboards in a semi-anechoic chamber and found them all vulnerable, primarily because of the prohibitive cost of adding shielding during manufacture. The researchers used a wide-band receiver to tune into the specific frequency of the emissions radiated from the keyboards.
*Optical surveillance: Optical surveillance, while not a keylogger in the classical sense, is nonetheless an approach that can be used to capture passwords or PINs. A strategically placed camera, such as a hidden surveillance camera at an ATM, can allow a criminal to watch a PIN or password being entered.
*Physical evidence: For a keypad that is used only to enter a security code, the keys which are in actual use will have evidence of use from many fingerprints. A passcode of four digits, if the four digits in question are known, is reduced from 10,000 possibilities to just 24 possibilities (104 versus 4! [factorial of 4]). These could then be used on separate occasions for a manual &quot;brute force attack&quot;.
*Smartphone sensors: Researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to capture the keystrokes of nearby computer keyboards using only the commodity accelerometer found in smartphones. The attack is made possible by placing a smartphone near a keyboard on the same desk. The smartphone&#x27;s accelerometer can then detect the vibrations created by typing on the keyboard and then translate this raw accelerometer signal into readable sentences with as much as 80 percent accuracy. The technique involves working through probability by detecting pairs of keystrokes, rather than individual keys. It models &quot;keyboard events&quot; in pairs and then works out whether the pair of keys pressed is on the left or the right side of the keyboard and whether they are close together or far apart on the QWERTY keyboard. Once it has worked this out, it compares the results to a preloaded dictionary where each word has been broken down in the same way. Similar techniques have also been shown to be effective at capturing keystrokes on touchscreen keyboards while in some cases, in combination with gyroscope or with the ambient-light sensor.
*Body keyloggers: Body keyloggers track and analyze body movements to determine which keys were pressed. The attacker needs to be familiar with the keys layout of the tracked keyboard to correlate between body movements and keys position, although with a suitably large sample this can be deduced. Tracking audible signals of the user&#x27; interface (e.g. a sound the device produce to informs the user that a keystroke was logged) may reduce the complexity of the body keylogging algorithms, as it marks the moment at which a key was pressed.

== Cracking ==
Writing simple software applications for keylogging can be trivial, and like any nefarious computer program, can be distributed as a trojan horse or as part of a virus. What is not trivial for an attacker, however, is installing a covert keystroke logger without getting caught and downloading data that has been logged without being traced. An attacker that manually connects to a host machine to download logged keystrokes risks being traced. A trojan that sends keylogged data to a fixed e-mail address or IP address risks exposing the attacker.

=== Trojans ===
Researchers Adam Young and Moti Yung discussed several methods of sending keystroke logging. They presented a deniable password snatching attack in which the keystroke logging trojan is installed using a virus or worm. An attacker who is caught with the virus or worm can claim to be a victim. The cryptotrojan asymmetrically encrypts the pilfered login/password pairs using the public key of the trojan author and covertly broadcasts the resulting ciphertext. They mentioned that the ciphertext can be steganographically encoded and posted to a public bulletin board such as Usenet.

=== Use by police ===
In 2000, the FBI used FlashCrest iSpy to obtain the PGP passphrase of Nicodemo Scarfo, Jr., son of mob boss Nicodemo Scarfo.
Also in 2000, the FBI lured two suspected Russian cybercriminals to the US in an elaborate ruse, and captured their usernames and passwords with a keylogger that was covertly installed on a machine that they used to access their computers in Russia. The FBI then used these credentials to gain access to the suspects&#x27; computers in Russia to obtain evidence to prosecute them.

== Countermeasures ==
The effectiveness of countermeasures varies because keyloggers use a variety of techniques to capture data and the countermeasure needs to be effective against the particular data capture technique. In the case of Windows 10 keylogging by Microsoft, changing certain privacy settings may disable it. An on-screen keyboard will be effective against hardware keyloggers; transparency will defeat some—but not all—screen loggers. An anti-spyware application that can only disable hook-based keyloggers will be ineffective against kernel-based keyloggers.

Keylogger program authors may be able to update their program&#x27;s code to adapt to countermeasures that have proven effective against it.

=== Anti-keyloggers ===

An anti-keylogger is a piece of software specifically designed to detect keyloggers on a computer, typically comparing all files in the computer against a database of keyloggers, looking for similarities which might indicate the presence of a hidden keylogger. As anti-keyloggers have been designed specifically to detect keyloggers, they have the potential to be more effective than conventional antivirus software; some antivirus software do not consider keyloggers to be malware, as under some circumstances a keylogger can be considered a legitimate piece of software.

=== Live CD/USB ===
Rebooting the computer using a Live CD or write-protected Live USB is a possible countermeasure against software keyloggers if the CD is clean of malware and the operating system contained on it is secured and fully patched so that it cannot be infected as soon as it is started. Booting a different operating system does not impact the use of a hardware or BIOS based keylogger.

=== Anti-spyware / Anti-virus programs ===
Many anti-spyware applications can detect some software based keyloggers and quarantine, disable, or remove them. However, because many keylogging programs are legitimate pieces of software under some circumstances, anti-spyware often neglects to label keylogging programs as spyware or a virus. These applications can detect software-based keyloggers based on patterns in executable code, heuristics and keylogger behaviors (such as the use of hooks and certain APIs).

No software-based anti-spyware application can be 100% effective against all keyloggers. Software-based anti-spyware cannot defeat non-software keyloggers (for example, hardware keyloggers attached to keyboards will always receive keystrokes before any software-based anti-spyware application).

The particular technique that the anti-spyware application uses will influence its potential effectiveness against software keyloggers. As a general rule, anti-spyware applications with higher privileges will defeat keyloggers with lower privileges. For example, a hook-based anti-spyware application cannot defeat a kernel-based keylogger (as the keylogger will receive the keystroke messages before the anti-spyware application), but it could potentially defeat hook- and API-based keyloggers.

=== Network monitors ===
Network monitors (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from &quot;phoning home&quot; with their typed information.

=== Automatic form filler programs ===

Automatic form-filling programs may prevent keylogging by removing the requirement for a user to type personal details and passwords using the keyboard. Form fillers are primarily designed for Web browsers to fill in checkout pages and log users into their accounts. Once the user&#x27;s account and credit card information has been entered into the program, it will be automatically entered into forms without ever using the keyboard or clipboard, thereby reducing the possibility that private data is being recorded. However, someone with physical access to the machine may still be able to install software that can intercept this information elsewhere in the operating system or while in transit on the network. (Transport Layer Security (TLS) reduces the risk that data in transit may be intercepted by network sniffers and proxy tools.)

=== One-time passwords (OTP) ===
Using one-time passwords may prevent unauthorized access to an account which has had its login details exposed to an attacker via a keylogger, as each password is invalidated as soon as it is used. This solution may be useful for someone using a public computer. However, an attacker who has remote control over such a computer can simply wait for the victim to enter their credentials before performing unauthorized transactions on their behalf while their session is active.

Another common way to protect access codes from being stolen by keystroke loggers is by asking users to provide a few randomly selected characters from their authentication code. For example, they might be asked to enter the 2nd, 5th, and 8th characters. Even if someone is watching the user or using a keystroke logger, they would only get a few characters from the code without knowing their positions.

=== Security tokens ===
Use of smart cards or other security tokens may improve security against replay attacks in the face of a successful keylogging attack, as accessing protected information would require both the (hardware) security token as well as the appropriate password/passphrase. Knowing the keystrokes, mouse actions, display, clipboard, etc. used on one computer will not subsequently help an attacker gain access to the protected resource. Some security tokens work as a type of hardware-assisted one-time password system, and others implement a cryptographic challenge–response authentication, which can improve security in a manner conceptually similar to one time passwords. Smartcard readers and their associated keypads for PIN entry may be vulnerable to keystroke logging through a so-called supply chain attack where an attacker substitutes the card reader/PIN entry hardware for one which records the user&#x27;s PIN.

=== On-screen keyboards ===
Most on-screen keyboards (such as the on-screen keyboard that comes with Windows XP) send normal keyboard event messages to the external target program to type text. Software key loggers can log these typed characters sent from one program to another.

=== Keystroke interference software ===
Keystroke interference software is also available.
These programs attempt to trick keyloggers by introducing random keystrokes, although this simply results in the keylogger recording more information than it needs to. An attacker has the task of extracting the keystrokes of interest—the security of this mechanism, specifically how well it stands up to cryptanalysis, is unclear.

=== Speech recognition ===
Similar to on-screen keyboards, speech-to-text conversion software can also be used against keyloggers, since there are no typing or mouse movements involved. The weakest point of using voice-recognition software may be how the software sends the recognized text to target software after the user&#x27;s speech has been processed.

=== Handwriting recognition and mouse gestures ===
Many PDAs and lately tablet PCs can already convert pen (also called stylus) movements on their touchscreens to computer understandable text successfully. Mouse gestures use this principle by using mouse movements instead of a stylus. Mouse gesture programs convert these strokes to user-definable actions, such as typing text. Similarly, graphics tablets and light pens can be used to input these gestures, however, these are becoming less common.

The same potential weakness of speech recognition applies to this technique as well.

=== Macro expanders/recorders ===
With the help of many programs, a seemingly meaningless text can be expanded to a meaningful text and most of the time context-sensitively, e.g. &quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot; can be expanded when a web browser window has the focus. The biggest weakness of this technique is that these programs send their keystrokes directly to the target program. However, this can be overcome by using the &#x27;alternating&#x27; technique described below, i.e. sending mouse clicks to non-responsive areas of the target program, sending meaningless keys, sending another mouse click to the target area (e.g. password field) and switching back-and-forth.

=== Deceptive typing ===
Alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window can cause a keylogger to record more information than it needs to, but this could be easily filtered out by an attacker. Similarly, a user can move their cursor using the mouse while typing, causing the logged keystrokes to be in the wrong order e.g., by typing a password beginning with the last letter and then using the mouse to move the cursor for each subsequent letter. Lastly, someone can also use context menus to remove, cut, copy, and paste parts of the typed text without using the keyboard. An attacker who can capture only parts of a password will have a larger key space to attack if they choose to execute a brute-force attack.

Another very similar technique uses the fact that any selected text portion is replaced by the next key typed. e.g., if the password is &quot;secret&quot;, one could type &quot;s&quot;, then some dummy keys &quot;asdf&quot;. These dummy characters could then be selected with the mouse, and the next character from the password &quot;e&quot; typed, which replaces the dummy characters &quot;asdf&quot;.

These techniques assume incorrectly that keystroke logging software cannot directly monitor the clipboard, the selected text in a form, or take a screenshot every time a keystroke or mouse click occurs. They may, however, be effective against some hardware keyloggers.

<text>Bernard Mannes Baruch (August 19, 1870 – June 20, 1965) was an American financier and .

After amassing a fortune on the New York Stock Exchange, he impressed President Woodrow Wilson by managing the nation&#x27;s economic mobilization in World War I as chairman of the War Industries Board. He advised Wilson during the Paris Peace Conference. He made another fortune in the postwar bull market, but foresaw the Wall Street crash and sold out well in advance. 

In World War II, he became a close advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the role of industry in war supply, and he was credited with greatly shortening the production time for tanks and aircraft. Later he helped to develop rehabilitation programs for injured servicemen. In 1946, he was the United States representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, though his Baruch Plan for international control of atomic energy was rejected by the Soviet Union.

==Early life and education==
Bernard Baruch was born on August 19, 1870, in Camden, South Carolina to a Jewish family. His parents were Belle (née Wolfe) and Simon Baruch, a physician, Confederate soldier and a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Bernard was the second of four sons, including brothers Herman B. Baruch, Sailing Wolfe Baruch, and Hartwig Nathaniel Baruch.

In 1879, the family moved from Camden to New York City, where Bernard and his brothers attended local schools. He studied at and graduated from the City College of New York.

==Business career==
Baruch became a broker and then a partner in A.A. Housman &amp; Company. With his earnings and commissions, he bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for $19,000 (). There, he amassed a fortune before the age of 30 speculating on the sugar market, which was booming in Hawaii. Baruch founded the Intercontinental Rubber Company of New York, which dominated the guayule rubber market in the U.S. with holdings in Mexico. His partners in the enterprise were Senator Nelson Aldrich, Daniel Guggenheim, John D. Rockefeller Jr., George Foster Peabody and others. By 1903, Baruch had his own brokerage firm and gained the reputation of &quot;The Lone Wolf of Wall Street&quot; because of his refusal to join any financial house. By 1910, he had become one of Wall Street&#x27;s best-known financiers.

After 1924, Baruch made millions in the bull market. He began to anticipate a crash as early as 1927 and sold stocks short periodically in 1927 and 1928. On September 25, 1929, after the 1929 post Labor Day peak of the Dow, Baruch refused to join a bull pool of financiers to support the declining market. He advised humorist Will Rogers to exit the market before the crash. &quot;I did what you told me,&quot; Rogers told Baruch when the two met after the Black Tuesday crash of October 29, 1929, &quot;and you saved my life&quot;.

==Presidential adviser==

=== World War I ===
In 1916, Baruch left Wall Street to advise Woodrow Wilson on national defense and terms of peace. He served on the Advisory Commission to the Council of National Defense and, in January 1918, became the chairman of the new War Industries Board. With his leadership, this body successfully managed the US&#x27;s economic mobilization during World War I. In 1919, Wilson asked Baruch to serve as a staff member at the Paris Peace Conference. Baruch did not approve of the reparations that France and Britain demanded of Germany, and he supported Wilson&#x27;s opinion that there needed to be new forms of cooperation, as well as the creation of the League of Nations.

For his services in support of the war effort, Baruch was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal with the following citation: 
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Mr. Bernard M. Baruch, a United States Civilian, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I, in the organization and administration of the War Industries Board and in the coordination of allied purchases in the United States. By establishing a broad and comprehensive policy for the supervision and control of the raw materials, manufacturing facilities, and distribution of the products of industry, he stimulated the production of war supplies, coordinated the needs of the military service and the civilian population, and contributed alike to the completeness and speed of the mobilization and equipment of the military forces and the continuity of their supply. War Department, General Orders No. 15 (1921)

=== Interwar period ===

In the 1920s and 1930s, Baruch expressed his concern that the United States needed to be prepared for the possibility of another world war. He wanted a more powerful version of the War Industries Board, which he saw as the only way to ensure maximum coordination between civilian business and military needs. Baruch remained a prominent government adviser during this time, and supported Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy initiatives after his election.

Baruch was also a major contributor to Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s controversial initiative to build a resettlement community for unemployed mining families in Arthurdale, West Virginia.

This relationship did not stop the congressional Nye Committee from investigating Baruch&#x27;s role in war profiteering.

In 1940, responding to pleas to help Harry Truman&#x27;s shoestring bid for reelection to the U.S. Senate, Baruch provided crucial funding.

=== World War II ===
When the United States entered World War II, Roosevelt appointed Baruch a special adviser to the director of the Office of War Mobilization. His offices at this time were at 120 Broadway. He supported what was known as a &quot;work or fight&quot; bill. Baruch advocated the creation of a permanent super-agency similar to his old Industries Board. His theory enhanced the role of civilian businessmen and industrialists in determining what was needed and who would produce it. Baruch&#x27;s ideas were largely adopted, with James Byrnes appointed to carry them out. It is estimated that these policies cut two years off the time taken to produce tanks, bombers, etc. and caught Hitler totally by surprise. During World War II, Baruch remained a trusted adviser and confidant of Roosevelt, who in 1944 spent a month as a guest at Baruch&#x27;s South Carolina estate, Hobcaw Barony.

In February 1943, Roosevelt invited Baruch to replace the widely criticized War Production Board head Donald M. Nelson. Baruch had long coveted the job, and responded that he only needed to ask his doctor if he was healthy enough for the post. During the delay, however, presidential advisor Harry Hopkins persuaded Roosevelt that firing Nelson at the army&#x27;s demands would make him look weak, and when Roosevelt and Baruch met at the White House, Roosevelt declined to discuss the job offer further.
In 1944, Baruch commissioned a committee of physicians which developed recommendations for the formal establishment of the medical specialty of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and provided over a million dollars of funding to many medical schools to further this cause. Baruch&#x27;s father, Simon Baruch, had been a surgeon and was the first teacher of physical medicine at Columbia. In the same year, Baruch and Dr. Howard Rusk, an Air Force physician, advised Roosevelt to expand rehabilitation programs for injured soldiers within all the armed forces. After the war, these programs were adopted by the Veterans&#x27; Administration.

In 1946, President Harry S. Truman appointed Baruch as the United States representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. On Friday, June 14, 1946, Baruch presented his Baruch Plan, a modified version of the Acheson–Lilienthal plan, to the UNAEC, which proposed international control of then-new atomic energy. The Soviet Union rejected Baruch&#x27;s proposal as unfair given the fact that the U.S. already had nuclear weapons; it proposed that the U.S. eliminate its nuclear weapons before a system of controls and inspections was implemented. A stalemate ensued.

Baruch resigned from the commission in 1947. His influence began to diminish, as his opinions grew further out-of-step with those of the Truman administration.

==Later life and death==
Baruch was well-known and often walked or sat in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Lafayette Park. A popular story exists which claims Baruch disliked being driven to the White House, and would sit on a bench and wait for a signal light indicating the President was ready to see him. This led to him being nicknamed &quot;the Park Bench Statesman&quot;.

In 1960, on his ninetieth birthday, a commemorative park bench in Lafayette Park across from the White House was dedicated to Baruch by the Boy Scouts. A life-size bronze of Baruch sitting on a park bench is in the lobby of Baruch College&#x27;s Vertical Campus.

He continued to advise on international affairs until his death from a heart attack on June 20, 1965 at his home in New York City, at the age of 94. His funeral at Temple Shaaray Tefila, the family synagogue, was attended by 700 people. His grave is at Flushing Cemetery, Flushing, Queens, New York City.

==Personal life==
Baruch owned a string of thoroughbred racehorses and raced under the name &quot;Kershaw Stable&quot;. In 1927, his horse, Happy Argo, won the Carter Handicap.
Winston Churchill and Baruch were personal friends, and Churchill sometimes stayed in Baruch&#x27;s New York home when visiting the United States.

=== Family ===
Baruch married Annie Griffin, an Episcopalian, of New York. Annie&#x27;s father did not consent to the marriage or attend their wedding but later reconciled with Bernard. They had three children: Belle Baruch; Bernard Baruch Jr.; and Renée Baruch. Their daughters were raised Episcopalian, while Bernard Jr. was allowed to choose his faith.

His daughter, Belle Baruch, an avid sportsperson, never married. His son, Bernard Baruch Jr., married Winifred Beatrice Mann, but the marriage ended in a divorce. They did not have any children. His daughter Renee married Henry Robert Samstag. They did not have any children. 

=== Hobcaw Barony ===
Between 1905 and 1907, Baruch purchased approximately 16,000 acres (63 square kilometers) of the former 18th century Hobcaw Barony, consolidating 14 plantations located on Waccamaw Neck, Georgetown County, South Carolina, between the Winyah Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. He developed sections of the property as a winter hunting resort and later sold the property to his eldest child, Belle. Upon her death in 1964, the property was transferred to The Belle W. Baruch Foundation as the Hobcaw Barony educational and research preserve. The property also includes 37 historic buildings representing the 18th and 19th century rice cultivation industry, and early-to-mid 20th century winter resorts. The entire property was named to the National Register of Historic Places on November 2, 1994.

The Trustees of The Belle W. Baruch Foundation subsequently selected the University of South Carolina and Clemson University as educational institutions with a mandate to preserve and study the Hobcaw Barony, including the wetlands forest and coastal ecosystems. The University of South Carolina established the Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences, and Clemson University established the Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences. Both universities have also formed partnerships with other schools in South Carolina that carry out research and educational programs which contribute to knowledge of coastal ecosystems.

The Belle W. Baruch Foundation and the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve jointly operate the Hobcaw Barony Discovery Center and provide tours and special programs.

== Legacy and honors ==
According to historian Thomas A. Krueger:
:For half a century Bernard Baruch was one of the country&#x27;s richest and most powerful men. A great speculator, public official, presidential counselor, political benefactor, and indefatigable almoner, his public life provides a clear view of the inner workings of the American political system.
In 1925, Baruch endowed the Mrs. Simon Baruch University Award to the United Daughters of the Confederacy in memory of his mother, to support scholars who had written unpublished monographs for full-length books on Confederate history. His mother had been an early member of the organization and supported its activities.

Baruch (along with Adlai Stevenson II) chose to donate his personal papers to Princeton University out of admiration for Woodrow Wilson and Dean Mathey.

<text>Frankfort is the capital city of the U.S. state of Kentucky. It is a home rule-class city and the seat of Franklin County. As of the 2020 census, the population was 28,602, making it the 13th largest city in Kentucky and fourth smallest U.S. state capital by population. Located along the Kentucky River, Frankfort is the principal city of the Frankfort, Kentucky micropolitan area, which includes all of Franklin and Anderson counties.

Before Frankfort was founded, the site was a ford across the Kentucky River, along one of the great buffalo trails used as highways in colonial America. English explorers first visited the area in the 1750s. The site evidently received its name after an incident in 1780, when pioneer Stephen Frank was killed in a skirmish with Native Americans; the crossing was named &quot;Frank&#x27;s Ford&quot; in his memory. In 1786, the Virginia legislature designated as the town of Frankfort and, after Kentucky became a state in 1792, it was chosen as capital.

The city is located in the inner Bluegrass region of Kentucky. The Kentucky River flows through the city, making a turn as it passes through the center of town; the Downtown and South Frankfort districts are opposite one another on each side of the river. The suburban areas on either side of the river valley are known as East and West Frankfort. Frankfort has four distinct seasons; winter is normally cool with some snowfall, while summers are hot and humid.

Because of the city&#x27;s location on the Kentucky River, it has flooded many times, with the two highest recorded floods occurring in 1937 and 1978. The North Frankfort levee, finished in 1969, and the South Frankfort floodwall, built in the 1990s, were constructed for flood protection. Five bridges cross the river in downtown Frankfort, including the St. Clair Street bridge and Capitol Avenue bridge. Notable locations include the Kentucky State Capitol building, the Capital City Museum, and Fort Hill, a promontory with a view of downtown.

As of 2016, the city&#x27;s largest industry was public administration with 28% of the workforce. Manufacturing totaled over 12% of the workforce. Frankfort is adjacent to Interstate 64, and Interstate 75 is nearby; general aviation access is via the Capital City Airport, and commercial air travel is available through Blue Grass Airport in Lexington.

==History==
===Pre-1900===
The town of Frankfort likely received its name from an event that took place in the 1780s. Native Americans attacked a group of early European colonists from Bryan Station, who were on their way to make salt at Mann&#x27;s Lick in Jefferson County. Pioneer Stephen Frank was killed at the Kentucky River and the settlers thereafter called the crossing &quot;Frank&#x27;s Ford&quot;. This name was later elided to Frankfort.

In 1786, James Wilkinson purchased a tract of land on the north side of the Kentucky River, which developed as downtown Frankfort. He was an early promoter of Frankfort as the state capital. Wilkinson felt Frankfort would be a center of transportation using the Kentucky River to ship farm produce to the Ohio River and then to the Mississippi and on to New Orleans.

After Kentucky became the 15th state in 1792, five commissioners from various counties were appointed, on 20 June 1792, to choose a location for the capital. They were John Allen and John Edwards (both from Bourbon County), Henry Lee (from Mason), Thomas Kennedy (from Madison), and Robert Todd (from Fayette). A number of communities competed for this honor, but Frankfort won. According to early histories, the offer of Andrew Holmes&#x27; log house as capitol for seven years, a number of town lots, £50 worth of locks and hinges, 10 boxes of glass, 1,500 pounds of nails, and $3,000 in gold helped the decision go to Frankfort.
Frankfort had a United States post office by 1794, with Daniel Weisiger as postmaster. On 1 October 1794, Weisiger sent the first quarterly account to Washington.

John Brown, a Virginia lawyer and statesman, built a home now called Liberty Hall in Frankfort in 1796. Before Kentucky statehood, he represented Virginia in the Continental Congress (1777−78) and the U.S. Congress (1789−91). While in Congress, he introduced the bill granting statehood to Kentucky. After statehood, he was elected by the state legislature as one of the state&#x27;s U.S. Senators.

In 1796, the Kentucky General Assembly appropriated funds to provide a house to accommodate the governor; it was completed two years later. The Old Governor&#x27;s Mansion is claimed to be the oldest official executive residence still in use in the United States. In 1829, Gideon Shryock designed the Old Capitol, Kentucky&#x27;s third, in Greek Revival style. It served Kentucky as its capitol from 1830 to 1910. The separate settlement known as South Frankfort was annexed by the city on 3 January 1850.

The &quot;Argus of Western America&quot; was published in Frankfort from 1808 until 1830.

During the American Civil War, the Union Army built fortifications overlooking Frankfort on what is now called Fort Hill. The Confederate Army also occupied Frankfort for a short time, starting on 3 September 1862, the only such time that Confederate forces took control of a Union capitol.

The Clinton Street High School, a segregated public school for African American students in Frankfort operated from either 1882 or 1884 until 1928.

=== 20th-century ===

On 3 February 1900, William Goebel was assassinated in Frankfort while walking to the capitol on the way to the Kentucky Legislature. Former Secretary of State Caleb Powers and several others were later found guilty of a conspiracy to murder Goebel, however all were later pardoned.

The Mayo–Underwood School, the successor to the Clinton Street High School, was a public school for African American students in Frankfort and operated from 1929 until 1964. The school was torn down as part of an urban renewal plan, and to make way for the Capital Plaza.

The Capital Plaza was comprised the Capital Plaza Office Tower, the tallest building in the city, the Capital Plaza Hotel (formerly the Holiday Inn, Frankfort), and the Fountain Place Shoppes. The Capital Plaza Office Tower opened in 1972 and became a visual landmark for the center of the city. By the early 2000s, maintenance of the concrete structures had been neglected and the plaza had fallen into disrepair, with sections of the plaza closed to pedestrian activity out of concerns for safety. In 2018 The Capital Plaza was demolished and a new state office building was constructed to take its place. The new building was named The Mayo-Underwood State Office Building to honor the namesake school that was razed for the sake of the original Capital Plaza.

Frankfort grew considerably with state government in the 1960s. A modern addition to the State Office Building was completed in 1967. The original building was completed in the 1930s on the location of the former Kentucky State Penitentiary. Some of the stone from the old prison was used for the walls surrounding the office building.

=== 21st-century ===
Although there was some rapid economic and population growth in the 1960s, both tapered off in the 1980s and have remained fairly stable since that time.

In August 2008, state government officials recommended demolition of the Capital Plaza Office Tower and redevelopment of the area over a period of years. Ten years later, the demolition of the office tower was completed on Sunday, March 11, 2018, and was televised by WKYT-TV on WKYT-DT2, as well as streamed live on Facebook. Demolition of the nearby convention center, which opened in 1972 and has hosted sporting events, concerts, and other local events, was completed in spring 2018. State officials replaced the outdated office tower with a smaller building called the Mayo–Underwood Building (2019), in order to create a more pedestrian-oriented scale at the complex, to encourage street activity.

Frankfort is home to three distilleries including the Buffalo Trace Distillery (Kentucky Bourbon), Castle &amp; Key Distillery (spirits), and Three Boys Farm Distillery (bourbon and whiskey).

In 2018, thousands of teachers protested at the city in response to Senate Bill 151 having been passed on 29 March 2018. The bill was shortly overturned on December 13, 2018, by the Kentucky Supreme Court as unconstitutional, which prevented the bill from going into effect on January 1, 2019.

==Geography==
Frankfort is located in the (inner) Bluegrass region of Central Kentucky. The city is bisected by the Kentucky River, which makes an s-turn as it passes through the center of town. The river valley widens at this point, which creates four distinct parts of town. The valley within the city limits contains Downtown and South Frankfort districts, which lie opposite one another on the river. A small neighborhood with its own distinct identity, Bellepoint, is located on the west bank of the river to the north of Benson Creek, opposite the river from the &quot;downtown&quot; district. The suburban areas on either side of the valley are respectively referred to as the &quot;West Side&quot; and &quot;East Side&quot; (or &quot;West Frankfort&quot; and &quot;East Frankfort&quot;).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Frankfort does not have a commercial airport and travelers fly into Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, the closest; Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport near Covington or Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville. Capital City Airport serves general and military aviation.

===Climate===
Frankfort has a humid subtropical climate with four distinct seasons. Winter is generally cool with some snowfall. Spring and fall are both mild and relatively warm, with ample precipitation and thunderstorm activity. Summers are hot and humid.

<text>Baton Rouge ( ; , ; ) is the capital city of the U.S. state of Louisiana. It had a population of 227,470 at the 2020 United States census, making it Louisiana&#x27;s second-most populous city. It is the seat of Louisiana&#x27;s most populous parish, East Baton Rouge Parish, and the center of Louisiana&#x27;s second-largest metropolitan area, Greater Baton Rouge, which had 870,569 residents in 2020.

Located on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River, the Baton Rouge area owes its historical importance to its strategic site upon the Istrouma Bluff, the first natural bluff upriver from the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. This allowed the development of a business quarter safe from seasonal flooding. In addition, it built a levee system stretching from the bluff southward to protect the riverfront and low-lying agricultural areas.

Baton Rouge has developed as a culturally rich center, settled by immigrants from European nations and African peoples brought to North America as slaves or indentured servants. It was ruled by seven different nations: the French, Spanish and British in the colonial era; briefly the Republic of West Florida; the United States as a territory and a state; the Confederate States of America; and the United States again since the end of the American Civil War. The city developed as a multicultural region practicing many religious traditions from Catholicism to Protestantism and Louisiana Voodoo.

Baton Rouge is a major industrial, petrochemical, medical, research, motion picture, and technology center of the Southern United States. It is the location of Louisiana State University, the LSU system&#x27;s flagship university and the state&#x27;s largest institution of higher education. It is also the location of Southern University, the flagship institution of the Southern University System—the nation&#x27;s only historically black college system.

The Port of Greater Baton Rouge is the tenth-largest in the U.S. by tonnage shipped, and it is the farthest upstream Mississippi River port capable of handling Panamax ships. Major corporations participating in the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area&#x27;s economy include Amazon, Lamar Advertising Company, BBQGuys, Marucci Sports, Piccadilly Restaurants, Raising Cane&#x27;s Chicken Fingers, ExxonMobil, Brown &amp; Root, Shell, and Dow Chemical Company.

==History==

=== Pre-history ===
Human habitation in the Baton Rouge area has been dated to 12000–6500 BC, based on evidence found along the Mississippi, Comite, and Amite rivers. Earthwork mounds were built by hunter-gatherer societies in the Middle Archaic period, from roughly the fourth millennium BC. The speakers of the Proto-Muskogean language divided into its descendant languages by about 1000 BC; and a cultural boundary between either side of Mobile Bay and the Black Warrior River began to appear between about 1200 BC and 500 BC—a period called the Middle &quot;Gulf Formational Stage&quot;. The Eastern Muskogean language began to diversify internally in the first half of the first millennium AD.

The early Muskogean societies were the bearers of the Mississippian culture, which formed around 800 AD and extended in a vast network across the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, with numerous chiefdoms in the Southeast, as well. By the time the Spanish made their first forays inland from the shores of the Gulf of Mexico in the early 16th century, by some evidence many political centers of the Mississippians were already in decline, or abandoned. At the time, this region appeared to have been occupied by a collection of moderately sized native chiefdoms, interspersed with autonomous villages and tribal groups. Other evidence indicates these Mississippian settlements were thriving at the time of the first Spanish contact. Later Spanish expeditions encountered the remains of groups who had lost many people and been disrupted in the aftermath of infectious diseases, chronic among Europeans, unknowingly introduced by the first expedition.

===Colonial period===
French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville led an exploration party up the Mississippi River in 1698. The explorers saw a red pole marking the boundary between the Houma and Bayagoula tribal hunting grounds. The French name &quot;le bâton rouge&quot; (&quot;the red stick&quot;) is the translation of a native term rendered as &quot;Istrouma&quot;, possibly a corruption of the Choctaw &quot;iti humma&quot; (&quot;red pole&quot;); André-Joseph Pénicaut—a carpenter traveling with d&#x27;Iberville—published the first full-length account of the expedition in 1723. According to Pénicaut:
From there Manchacq] we went five leagues higher and found very high banks called &quot;écorts&quot; in that region, and in savage called &quot;Istrouma&quot; which means red stick [&quot;bâton rouge&quot;], as at this place there is a post painted red that the savages have sunk there to mark the land line between the two nations, namely: the land of the Bayagoulas which they were leaving and the land of another nation—thirty leagues upstream from the &quot;baton rouge&quot;—named the Oumas.The red pole was presumably at Scott&#x27;s Bluff, on what is now the campus of Southern University. It was reportedly a painted pole adorned with fish bones.

European settlement of Baton Rouge began in 1721 when French colonists established a military and trading post. Since then, Baton Rouge has been governed by France, Britain, Spain, Louisiana, the Republic of West Florida, the United States, the Confederate States, and the United States again. In 1755, when French settlers in the colony of Acadia (known as Acadians) were deported from there by British authorities, many took up residence in rural Louisiana, including Baton Rouge. Popularly known as Cajuns they maintained a distinct culture for centuries. From 1763 to 1783, Baton Rouge was part of the British North American colony of West Florida, though it was captured by Spanish forces in September 1779. During the first half of the 19th century, Baton Rouge grew steadily as the result of steamboat trade and transportation.

===Incorporation and growth===
Baton Rouge was incorporated in 1817. In 1822, the Pentagon Barracks complex of buildings was completed. The site was used by Spanish, French, and British authorities and was occupied by both the Confederate States Army and United States Army. It was also part of the short-lived Republic of West Florida. In 1951, ownership of the barracks was transferred to the state of Louisiana. In 1976, the complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Acquisition of Louisiana by the United States in 1803 was a catalyst for increased Anglo-American settlement, especially in the northern part of the state. In 1846, the state legislature designated Baton Rouge as Louisiana&#x27;s new capital to replace &quot;sinful&quot; New Orleans. The architect James Dakin was hired to design the old Louisiana State Capitol, with construction beginning in late 1847.

Rather than mimic the United States Capitol, as many other states had done, he designed a capitol in Neo-Gothic style, complete with turrets and crenellations, and stained glass; it overlooks the Mississippi. It has been described as the &quot;most distinguished example of Gothic Revival&quot; architecture in the state and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.

By the outbreak of the American Civil War, the population of Baton Rouge was nearly 5,500. The war nearly halted economic progress, except for businesses associated with supplying the Union Army occupation of the city, which began in the spring of 1862 and lasted for the duration of the war. The Confederates at first consolidated their forces elsewhere, during which time the state government moved to Opelousas and later Shreveport. In the summer of 1862, about 2,600 Confederate troops under generals John C. Breckinridge (the former Vice President of the United States) and Daniel Ruggles attempted to recapture Baton Rouge.

After the war, New Orleans temporarily served as the seat of the Reconstruction era state government. When the Bourbon Democrats regained power in 1882, after considerable intimidation and voter suppression of black Republicans, they returned the state government to Baton Rouge, where it has since remained. In his 1893 guidebook, Karl Baedeker described Baton Rouge as &quot;the Capital of Louisiana, a quaint old place with 10,378 inhabitants, on a bluff above the Mississippi&quot;.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the petrochemical industry boomed in Baton Rouge, stimulating the city&#x27;s expansion beyond its original center. The changing market in the oil business has produced fluctuations in the industry, affecting employment in the city and area. In 1953, there was a bus boycott by black riders who were forbidden to occupy seats reserved for whites, leading eventually to some improvement of their rights.

On January 10, 1972, a violent shootout between members of the Nation of Islam (NOI) and the police ensued, which left two sheriff&#x27;s deputies and two black males dead at the scene. 31 individuals were injured, including 14 police officers. In response, then-Louisiana Governor John McKeithen ordered 700 members of the Louisiana National Guard to patrol the streets to tamp down further intercity violence. Baton Rouge Mayor-President Woodrow Wilson &quot;W. W.&quot; Dumas subsequently imposed an evening to early-morning curfew. On January 14, the curfew was lifted.

A building boom began in the city in the 1990s and continued into the 2000s, during which Baton Rouge became one of the fastest-growing cities in the Southern United States in terms of technology. Metropolitan Baton Rouge was ranked as one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the U.S. (with a population under 1 million), with 602,894 in 2000 and 802,484 people as of the 2010 U.S. census. After the extensive damage in New Orleans and along the coast from Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, the city took in as many as 200,000 displaced residents.

In 2010, Baton Rouge started a market push to become a test city for Google&#x27;s new super high speed fiber optic line known as GeauxFiBR.

In July 2016, the Greater Baton Rouge metropolitan area was heavily affected by the shooting of Alton Sterling. His death led to multiple protests and the shooting of police officers. President Barack Obama also made remarks on the shooting of Alton Sterling. By February 2021, Sterling&#x27;s family was given a $4.5 million settlement to settle a wrongful death lawsuit. In August 2016, the city and metropolitan area were severely flooded.

During the runoff for District 3 of the Louisiana Public Service Commission in December 2022, many Baton Rougeans helped elect Davante Lewis—the first openly LGBT politician to the state government.

On April 28, 2024, the Louisiana State Supreme Court gave the city of St. George the right to secede from Baton Rouge, in a 4–3 decision.

==Geography==
The city of Baton Rouge lies on the banks of the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana&#x27;s Florida Parishes region. The city is about from New Orleans, from Alexandria, from Lafayette and from Shreveport. It is also from Jackson, Mississippi and from Houston, Texas. Baton Rouge lies on a low elevation of 56 to a little over 62 feet above sea level.

Baton Rouge is the capital of Louisiana and the parish seat of East Baton Rouge Parish. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which are land and (2.81%) are covered by water.

Baton Rouge is on the first set of bluffs north of the Mississippi River Delta&#x27;s coastal plains. Because of its prominent location along the river and on the bluffs, which prevents flooding, the French built a fort in the city in 1719. Baton Rouge is the third-southernmost capital city in the continental United States, after Austin, Texas, and Tallahassee, Florida. It is the cultural and economic center of the Greater Baton Rouge metropolitan area.

=== Climate ===

Baton Rouge has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;). It has mild winters, hot and humid summers, moderate to heavy rainfall, and the possibility of damaging winds and tornadoes yearlong. The area&#x27;s average precipitation is 61.94 inches (141.1 cm) of rain and 0.1 inches (0.25 cm) of snow annually. With ample precipitation, Baton Rouge is fifth on the list of wettest cities in the United States. Snow in the Baton Rouge area is usually rare, although it snowed in three consecutive years at the first decade of the 21st century: December 11, 2008, December 4, 2009, and February 12, 2010. In 2017, Baton Rouge received snow again. The yearly average temperature for Baton Rouge is . The average temperature for January is and July is . The area is usually free from extremes in temperature, with some cold winter fronts, but those are usually brief.

Baton Rouge&#x27;s proximity to the Gulf of Mexico exposes the city and metropolitan area to hurricanes. On September 1, 2008, Hurricane Gustav struck the city and became the worst hurricane ever to hit the Baton Rouge area. Winds topped , knocking down trees and powerlines and making roads impassable. The roofs of many buildings suffered tree damage, especially in the Highland Road, Garden District, and Goodwood areas. The city was shut down for five days and a curfew was put in effect. Rooftop shingles were ripped off, signs blew down, and minor structural damage occurred.

==Demographics==
Prior to colonization, American Indians were once the primary residents of present-day Baton Rouge. With the coming of European colonization, and the migration of American settlers after the Louisiana Purchase, European and African-descended peoples became the predominant groups in the area by birth rates and immigration to a 1860 population of 5,428. Since reaching its first historic high of 220,394 residents at the 1980 U.S. census, the city&#x27;s population has expanded and contracted twice: from 219,531 in 1990, to 227,818 in 2000—the second historic high—and 229,493, the city-proper&#x27;s third historic high in 2010, to 227,470 at the 2020 United States census. The black population gradually increased in Baton Rouge after the Civil War.

Including the consolidated city–parish of Baton Rouge in 2019 (East Baton Rouge Parish), the American Community Survey estimated 443,763 people lived in the area. In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau determined 456,781 people lived in the consolidated city–parish. The metropolitan population of Baton Rouge increased to 3.6% as a result of suburbanization in 2019, to an estimated 854,884. In 2020, the metropolitan statistical area&#x27;s population increased to 870,569 residents, reflecting southern Louisiana&#x27;s population growth in contrast with northern Louisiana&#x27;s stagnation and decline.

In 2019, the city of Baton Rouge had a population density of 2,982.5 people per square mile.

=== Racial and ethnic composition ===
With the population growth of European and African-descended peoples in present-day Baton Rouge, the American Indian population declined to one of the smallest minority groups in the area. With the increase among people of color during the 20th century, Baton Rouge has also declined as a predominantly non-Hispanic white city, hastened by suburbanization, aging out, and white flight. In 1970, non-Hispanic whites were 70.5% of the population. In 2020, they were 34.2% of the total population.

In the 2020 United States census, Black or African Americans made up the majority (53.55%) of the city-proper&#x27;s population. In 2021 census estimates, Black or African Americans made up the largest share of youths. The remaining racial and ethnic makeup for the city in 2020 was 34.22% non-Hispanic white, 0.17% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.21% Asian, 0.03% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 2.55% two or more races, and 5.94% Hispanic and Latino American of any race. The growing Hispanic and Latino population reflected increasing trends of nationwide diversification. Among the population of the city and metropolitan area, a substantial number identify as Cajun or Louisiana Creole.

=== Sexual orientation and identity ===
During the middle of the 20th century, &quot;The Advocate&quot; and other region-wide newspapers discriminated against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. In 1969, the Krewe of Apollo—an LGBT social club originating from nearby New Orleans—developed a sister branch for Baton Rouge. Its annual drag balls were targets of further discrimination. Since then, other organizations have been established, such as the Capital City Alliance. The area has grown a sizeable LGBT community, holding festivals such as Baton Rouge Pride.

=== Religion and spirituality ===

Native American religions and Afrodiasporic religions were commonplace alongside Christianity in Baton Rouge&#x27;s early history. Due to French, Spanish, and British colonization and missionary efforts, in addition to American settlement, Baton Rouge became a predominantly Christian city and metropolitan area. In a 2020 study by the Association of Religion Data Archives, Christianity is the most-practiced religion for the Baton Rouge area, being influenced by Catholicism and Protestantism.

In 2020, ARDA reported there were 61 congregations and 174,410 Catholics within the metropolitan area. The Catholic population is primarily served by the Latin Church&#x27;s Roman Catholic Diocese of Baton Rouge—a suffragan diocese of the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of New Orleans. The Southern Baptist Convention was the second largest individual Christian denomination with 208 congregations and 91,293 members. The United Methodists had 28,924 members. The National Baptist Convention had 15,532 adherents in 25 churches. Non-denominational Protestants were spread out in 270 churches numbering 102,500.

In a 2019 study by Sperling&#x27;s BestPlaces, other notable Christian bodies in the area include Anglicans or Episcopalians, Pentecostals, Presbyterians, Latter-Day Saints, and Lutherans. Christians including Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, the Metropolitan Community Church, Christian Unitarians, and the Eastern Orthodox among others collectively made up 14% of the Sperling&#x27;s study other Christian demographic. Notable Anglican or Episcopalian jurisdictions operating throughout the Greater Baton Rouge area include the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana aligned with the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States; and the Reformed Episcopal Diocese of Mid-America and the Anglican Diocese of the Western Gulf Coast aligned with the Anglican Church in North America.

Baton Rouge&#x27;s Pentecostal communities are mainly affiliated with the Assemblies of God USA and the Church of God in Christ. Presbyterians are mainly members of the Presbyterian Church (USA). In 2020, the Church of God in Christ was the area&#x27;s largest Pentecostal denomination by membership.

In 2019, the second-largest religion in Baton Rouge and its metropolitan area was Islam. In 2020, there were over six mosques in the Baton Rouge area, primarily affiliated with Sunni Islam. The Nation of Islam also has a presence in the area. The Muslim population has grown out of Middle Eastern immigration and African American Muslim missionary work. The first Islamic private school in Baton Rouge was established in 2019.

In 2019, Orthodox Jews made up 0.2% of Baton Rouge&#x27;s religious population. 0.6% of the population identified with eastern faiths. including Buddhism and Hinduism. New religious movements including contemporary paganism have small communities in the area, and a minority practice Haitian Vodou, Louisiana Voodoo, and Hoodoo. In Sperling&#x27;s 2019 study, 31.9% of the population identified as either spiritual but not religious, agnostic, or atheist

==Economy==
Baton Rouge enjoys a strong economy that has helped the city be ranked as one of the &quot;Top 10 Places for Young Adults&quot; in 2010 by portfolio.com and one of the top 20 cities in North America for economic strength by the Brookings Institution. In 2009, the city was ranked by CNN as the 9th-best place in the country to start a new business. Lamar Advertising Company has its headquarters in Baton Rouge. Other notable companies headquartered in the city include BBQGuys, Marucci Sports, Piccadilly Restaurants, and Raising Cane&#x27;s Chicken Fingers. Notable corporations which have established offices or distribution centers in the Baton Rouge area have included Amazon in 2021, and Microsoft. Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company had an office in Baton Rouge before being sold in 2017. In 2023, Aldi established a presence in Baton Rouge.

Baton Rouge is the farthest inland port on the Mississippi River that can accommodate ocean-going tankers and cargo carriers. The ships transfer their cargo (grain, oil, cars, containers) at Baton Rouge onto rails and pipelines (to travel east–west) or barges (to travel north). Deep-draft vessels cannot pass the Old Huey Long Bridge because the clearance is insufficient. In addition, the river depth decreases significantly just to the north, near Port Hudson.

Baton Rouge&#x27;s largest industry is petrochemical production and manufacturing. ExxonMobil&#x27;s Baton Rouge Refinery complex is the fifth-largest oil refinery in the country; it is the world&#x27;s tenth largest. Baton Rouge also has rail, highway, pipeline, and deep-water access. Dow Chemical Company has a large plant in Iberville Parish near Plaquemine, south of Baton Rouge. Shaw Construction, Turner, and Harmony all started with performing construction work at these plants.

In addition to being the state capital and parish seat, the city is the home of Louisiana State University, which employs over 5,000 academic staff. One of the largest single employers in Baton Rouge is the state government, which consolidated all branches of state government downtown at the Capitol Park complex.

The city has a substantial medical research and clinical presence. Research hospitals have included Our Lady of the Lake, Our Lady of the Lake Children&#x27;s Hospital (affiliated with St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital), Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center, and Earl K. Long (closed 2013). Together with an emerging medical corridor at Essen Lane, Summa Avenue and Bluebonnet Boulevard, Baton Rouge is developing a medical district expected to be similar to the Texas Medical Center. LSU and Tulane University have both announced plans to construct satellite medical campuses in Baton Rouge to partner with Our Lady of the Lake Medical Center and Baton Rouge General Medical Center, respectively.

Southeastern Louisiana University and Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady University both have nursing schools in the medical district off Essen Lane. Louisiana State University&#x27;s Pennington Biomedical Research Center, which conducts clinical and biological research, also contributes to research-related employment in the area around the Baton Rouge medical district.

The film industry in Louisiana has increased dramatically since the beginning of the 21st century, aided by generous tax incentives adopted by the state in 2002. In September 2013, the Baton Rouge Film Commission reported that the industry had brought more than $90 million into the local economy in 2013. Baton Rouge&#x27;s largest production facility is the Celtic Media Centre, opened in 2006 by a local group in collaboration with Raleigh Studios of Los Angeles. Raleigh dropped its involvement in 2014.

==Culture and arts==
Baton Rouge is a culturally distinct area of Louisiana, where Cajun and Creole Catholic culture from Greater New Orleans and Acadiana is syncretized with the African American Baptist culture of the Florida Parishes and South Mississippi. The city of Baton Rouge is a &quot;college town&quot; with Baton Rouge Community College, Louisiana State University, Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady University, and Southern University located throughout the city limits; the students of Louisiana State University alone make up 20% of the city population. In a sizable international population of over 11,300 as of 2008, the largest groups were people of Hispanic and Latino, or Vietnamese descent. This contributes to Baton Rouge&#x27;s unique culture and diversity.

===Arts and theater===
Baton Rouge has an expanding visual arts scene, which is centered downtown. Professional performing arts organizations include Theatre Baton Rouge, the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra, Baton Rouge Ballet Theatre, Opera Louisiane and Playmakers—a professional Children&#x27;s Theatre. This increasing collection of venues includes the Shaw Center for the Arts. Opened in 2005, the facility houses the Brunner Gallery, LSU Museum of Art; the Manship Theatre; a contemporary art gallery; traveling exhibits; and several eateries. Another prominent facility is the Louisiana Art and Science Museum, which contains the Irene W. Pennington Planetarium, traveling art exhibits, space displays, and an ancient Egyptian section. Several smaller art galleries, including the Baton Rouge Gallery, offering a range of local art, are scattered throughout the city.

The city has several designated arts and cultural districts, the most prominent of which are the Mid-City Cultural District and the Perkins Road Arts District. These districts provide tax incentives, mostly in the form of exempting state tax on purchases, to promote cultural activity in these areas. Located in a Qualified Census Tract the North Baton Rouge community of Scotlandville was designated a Cultural District in 2020.

A performing arts scene is emerging. LSU&#x27;s Swine Palace is the foremost theatre company in the city, largely made up of students of LSU&#x27;s MFA acting program, as well as professional actors and stage managers. A group of physical theatre and circus artists from LSU traveled to Edinburgh, Scotland, in summer 2012 to perform &quot;Dante&quot; in what has become the world&#x27;s largest Fringe Festival. The show ran in Baton Rouge before going to Fringe, and featured movement, acrobatics, and aerial silk.

Theatre Baton Rouge offers a diverse selection of live theatre performances. Opera Louisiane is Baton Rouge&#x27;s only professional opera company. The Baton Rouge Ballet Theatre is Baton Rouge&#x27;s professional ballet company. &quot;The Nutcracker– A Tale from the Bayou&quot; sets the familiar holiday classic in 19th-century Louisiana and has become a Baton Rouge holiday tradition. &quot;A Tale from the Bayou&quot; features professional dancers, a live orchestra, and more than 300 area children.

Baton Rouge is also home to Forward Arts, a youth writing organization. Forward Arts won the international youth poetry slam, Brave New Voices in 2017, and was the first team from the Southern United States to ever win the competition. Forward Arts is the only youth spoken-word organization in the state of Louisiana. It was founded by Dr. Anna West in 2005, and first housed in the Big Buddy Program.

Baton Rouge is also home to Of Moving Colors Productions, the premier contemporary dance company in the city. For more than 30 years it has brought in internationally established choreographers to create stunning performances. In addition, they conduct extensive community outreach to children and young adults.

Performing venues include the Baton Rouge River Center, Baton Rouge River Center Theatre for the Performing Arts, which seats about 1,900; the Manship Theatre, which is located in the Shaw Center for the Arts and seats 350; and the Reilly Theater, which is home to Swine Palace, a nonprofit professional theater company associated with the Louisiana State University Department of Theatre.

The Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra has operated since 1947 and currently performs at the River Center Music Hall downtown. Today, it presents more than 60 concerts annually, directed by Timothy Muffitt and David Torns. The BRSO&#x27;s educational component, the Louisiana Youth Orchestra, made its debut in 1984. It includes almost 180 musicians under the age of 20.

===Miss USA pageants===
Baton Rouge was chosen to host the Miss USA 2014 Pageant. It took over downtown Baton Rouge as Nia Sanchez, Miss Nevada USA, took home the crown, with Miss Louisiana USA Brittany Guidry coming in fourth. Veteran pageant host Giuliana Rancic and MSNBC news anchor Thomas Roberts introduced the 51 contestants; there were 20 semifinalists. &quot;Cosmo&quot; weighed in on the contest, complimenting Guidry. Celebrity judges included actress Rumer Willis, NBA star Karl Malone, singer Lance Bass, and actor Ian Ziering. Baton Rouge hosted Miss USA 2015 again on July 12, 2015, which was won by actress and Miss Oklahoma USA Olivia Jordan. Baton Rouge was also the site of the 2005 Miss Teen USA Pageant.

===Tourism and recreation===

Baton Rouge&#x27;s many architectural points of interest range from antebellum to modern. The neo-gothic Old Louisiana State Capitol was built in the 1850s as the first statehouse in Baton Rouge. It was later replaced by the 450-ft-tall, art deco New Louisiana State Capitol, the tallest building in the South when it was completed. Several plantation homes in the area, such as Magnolia Mound Plantation House, Myrtles Plantation, and Nottoway Plantation, showcase antebellum-era architecture.

Louisiana State University has more than 250 buildings in Italian Renaissance style, one of the nation&#x27;s largest college stadiums, and many live oaks. The downtown has several examples of modern and contemporary buildings, including the Capitol Park Museum.

A number of structures, including the Baton Rouge River Center, Louisiana State Library, LSU Student Union, Louisiana Naval Museum, Bluebonnet Swamp Interpretive Center, Louisiana Arts and Sciences Center, Louisiana State Archive and Research Library, and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, were designed by local architect John Desmond. The Pentagon Barracks Museum and Visitors Center is within the barracks complex and the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad Company Depot houses the Louisiana Art and Science Museum.

Museums around town offer a variety of genres. The Capitol Park Museum and the Old Louisiana State Capitol Museum display information on state history and have many interactive exhibits. The Shaw Center for the Arts and the Louisiana Art and Science Museum showcase varied arts. LASM also includes science exhibits and a planetarium. Other museums include the LSU Museum of Natural Science and the USS&quot; Kidd&quot;. The Odell S. Williams Now And Then African-American Museum chronicles the progression and growth of African-Americans.

The Greater Baton Rouge State Fair is an annual one-week attraction held every mid-fall. The fair began in 1965 and has been under the management of the Baton Rouge Jaycee organization since 1985. In 2021, the fair set an attendance record with over 100,000 attendees.

Other attractions include the Mall of Louisiana and Perkins Rowe, amusement parks of Dixie Landin&#x27;/Blue Bayou, and dining at the Louisiana-cuisine restaurants.

==Sports==

College sports play a major role in the culture of Baton Rouge. The LSU Tigers and the Southern University Jaguars are NCAA Division I athletic programs with the LSU Tigers football and Southern Jaguars football teams being the local college American football teams. College baseball, basketball, and gymnastics are also popular.

Much of the city&#x27;s sport&#x27;s attention is focused on the professional teams in Greater New Orleans. Baton Rouge has had multiple minor-league baseball teams (the Baton Rouge Red Sticks), soccer teams (Baton Rouge Bombers), indoor football teams, a basketball team, and a hockey team (Baton Rouge Kingfish).

Following a successful round of exhibition games, the Federal Prospects Hockey League announced that Baton Rouge would be awarded a franchise, beginning play in 2023. The Baton Rouge Zydeco play their home games at the River Center.

The city is home to many alternative or less known leagues. For Australian rules football, the city has the Baton Rouge Tigers which began play in 2004 and competes in the USAFL. The Baton Rouge Rugby Football Club began playing in 1977 and has won numerous conference championships. Currently, the team competes in the Deep South Rugby Football Union. Baton Rouge is also home to Red Stick Roller Derby, a WFTDA Division 3 roller derby league.

The Baton Rouge Rougarou, a college summer league baseball team in the Texas Collegiate League play home games at Pete Goldsby Field in the north of the city.

Soccer for the city currently consists of Louisiana Parish AC of USL League Two. The team plays at various home fields including LSU recreation fields on campus and BREC Memorial Stadium near the Rougarou&#x27;s home field.

==Parks and recreation==

Baton Rouge has an extensive park collection presided over by the Recreation and Park Commission for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (BREC). The largest park is City Park near the Louisiana State University flagship campus. Another notable park is Highland Road Community Park, spanning over . The Baton Rouge Zoo is also run through BREC and includes over 1,800 species.

===National protected areas===
The city is home to 7 national protected areas, and at least 15 places on the National Register of Historic Places: Atchafalaya National Heritage Area, Baton Rouge National Cemetery, Independence Park Botanic Gardens, Laurens Henry Cohn Sr. Memorial Plant Arboretum, LSU Hilltop Arboretum, Magnolia Cemetery, and Port Hudson National Cemetery.

Among its protected areas, the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area extends the length of the Atchafalaya Basin from the area of Ferriday in the north to the river&#x27;s mouth beyond Morgan City; the designation provides a framework for the promotion and interpretation of the area&#x27;s cultural and historic character, and the preservation of the natural and built environment. The Cohn Arboretum previously served as the site for the Cohn family&#x27;s home; its land was donated in 1965 and the arboretum opened in 1980. LSU&#x27;s arboretum was originally developed in 1929 and donated to the university in 1981.

==Government==
The city of Baton Rouge and the Parish of East Baton Rouge have been run by a consolidated government since 1947. It combined the Baton Rouge municipal government with the rural areas of the parish, allowing people outside the limits of the city of Baton Rouge to use city services. Though the city and parish have a consolidated government, this differs slightly from a traditional consolidated city-county government.

The cities of Zachary, Baker, Central, and St. George operate their own city governments within East Baton Rouge Parish. Under this system, Baton Rouge has the uncommon office of &quot;mayor-president&quot;, which consolidates the executive offices of &quot;mayor of Baton Rouge&quot; and &quot;president of East Baton Rouge Parish&quot;. Though Zachary, Baker, and Central each have their own mayors, citizens living in these municipalities are still a part of the constituency who can vote and run in elections for mayor-president and metropolitan council.

The mayor-president&#x27;s duties include setting the agenda for the government and managing the government&#x27;s day-to-day functions. They are also responsible for supervising departments, as well as appointing the department heads. The mayor does not set the city&#x27;s public policy because that is the Metropolitan Council&#x27;s role, but the mayor-president does have some influence on the policy through appointments and relationships with council members.

The current mayor-president of Baton Rouge is Republican Sid Edwards.

===Metropolitan council===
When the city and parish combined government, the city and parish councils consolidated to form the East Baton Rouge Parish Metropolitan Council. The Metropolitan Council is the legislative branch of the Baton Rouge government. Its 12 district council members are elected from single-member districts. They elect from among themselves the mayor-president&quot; pro tempore&quot;. The mayor-president pro tempore presides over the council&#x27;s meetings and assumes the role of the mayor-president if the mayor-president is unable to serve. The council members serve four-year terms and can hold office for three terms.

In the late 1960s, Joe Delpit—a local African American businessman owning and operating the Chicken Shack—was elected as the first black council member in Baton Rouge. As in other cities of Louisiana and the South, African Americans had been largely disenfranchised for decades into the 20th century. The Chicken Shack, with multiple locations, in 2015 was reported as the oldest continually operating business in Baton Rouge.

The Metropolitan Council&#x27;s main responsibilities are setting the policy for the government, voting on legislation, and approving the city&#x27;s budget. The council makes policies for the following: the city and parish general funds, all districts created by the council, the Greater Baton Rouge Airport District, the Public Transportation Commission, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sewerage Control Commission and the Greater Baton Rouge Parking Authority.

== Education ==

Baton Rouge is home to many universities. Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, generally known as Louisiana State University or LSU, is a public university that is the flagship campus of the Louisiana State University System.

The State Library of Louisiana is in Baton Rouge. The Louisiana Legislature created the Louisiana Library Commission in 1920. This later became the State Library of Louisiana. The State Library provides Louisiana residents with millions of items with its collections, electronic resources, and the statewide network for lending.

The East Baton Rouge Parish Library System has 14 local libraries with one main library and 13 community libraries. The main library at Goodwood houses genealogy and local history archives. The library system is an entity of the city-parish government. The system has been in operation since 1939. It is governed by the EBR Parish government and directed by the Library Board of Control. The Baton Rouge Metropolitan Council appoints the seven-member board and then the board appoints a director. According to its website, all branches are open seven days a week to assist the public with reference and information and computer access.

The Louisiana State Archives&#x27; Main Research Library is located in Baton Rouge, as well. It houses general history books, census indices, immigration schedules, church records, and family histories.

In 2006, Cox Communications linked its Lafayette, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans markets with fiber-optic infrastructure. Other providers soon followed suit, and fiber optics have thus far proven reliable in all hurricanes since they were installed, even when mobile and broadband services are disrupted during storms. In 2001, the Supermike computer at Louisiana State University was ranked as the number-one computer cluster in the world, and remains one of the top 500 computing sites in the world.

==Military installations==
Baton Rouge is home station to the Louisiana Army National Guard 769th Engineer Battalion, which had units deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. The armory near LSU has three company-sized units: 769th HSC (headquarters support company); 769th FSC (forward support company); and the 927th Sapper Company. Other units of the battalion are located at Napoleonville (928th Sapper Company); Baker, Louisiana (926th MAC mobility augmentation company); and Gonzales, Louisiana (922nd Horizontal Construction Company).

The 769th Engineer Battalion is part of the 225th Engineer Brigade, headquartered in Pineville, Louisiana, at Louisiana National Guard Training Center Pineville. Four engineer battalions and an independent bridging company are in the 225th Engineer Brigade, making it the largest engineer group in the US Army Corps of Engineers.

Baton Rouge is also home to 3rd Battalion, 23rd Marine Regiment (3/23), a reserve infantry battalion in the United States Marine Corps located throughout the Midwestern United States consisting of about 800 marines and sailors. The battalion was first formed in 1943 for service in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II, taking part in a number of significant battles including those at Saipan and Iwo Jima before being deactivated at the end of the war. In the early 1960s, the unit was reactivated as a reserve battalion. The battalion is headquartered in Saint Louis, Missouri, with outlying units throughout the Midwestern United States. 3/23 falls under the command of the 23rd Marine Regiment and the 4th Marine Division.

==Transportation==
===Highways and roads===
====Interstates====
Baton Rouge has three interstate highways: I-10, I-12 (Republic of West Florida Parkway), and I-110 (Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway).

Interstate 10 enters the city from the Horace Wilkinson Bridge over the Mississippi River, curving at an interchange with Interstate 110 southeast, crossing the LSU lakes and Garden District before reaching an interchange with I-12 (referred to as the 10/12 split). It curves further southeast toward New Orleans as it crosses Essen Lane near the Medical District. It passes Bluebonnet Blvd and the Mall of Louisiana at exit 162, and leaves Baton Rouge after interchanges with Siegen Lane and Highland Road.

Interstate 12 (The Republic of West Florida Parkway) begins in the city at the I-10/I-12 split east of College Drive, and proceeds eastward, crossing Essen Lane, Airline Hwy, Sherwood Forest Blvd, Millerville Road, and O&#x27;neal Lane before leaving the city when crossing the Amite River.

Interstate 110 (The Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway) stretches 8 miles in a north–south direction from the east end of the Horace Wilkinson Bridge to Scenic Highway in Scotlandville, Louisiana. It passes through downtown, North Baton Rouge, and Baton Rouge Metro Airport before ending at Scenic Highway.

====U.S. highways and major roads====
Baton Rouge has two U.S. highways, along with their business counterparts: Airline Highway (US 61) and Florida Boulevard.

U.S. 190 enters the city from the Huey P. Long Bridge, beginning a concurrency with U.S. 61 after an interchange with Scenic Highway, near Scotlandville. Its name is Airline Highway from this interchange to the interchange with Florida Blvd. At this interchange, U.S. 190 turns east to follow Florida Blvd through Northeast Baton Rouge, exiting the city at the Amite River.

U.S. 61 enters Baton Rouge as Scenic Highway until it reaches Airline Highway (U.S. 190). It becomes concurrent with U.S. 190 until Florida Blvd, where it continues south, still called Airline Highway. It passes through Goodwood and Broadmoor before an interchange with I-12. It continues southeast past Bluebonnet Blvd/Coursey Blvd, Jefferson Hwy, and Sherwood Forest Blvd/Siegen Lane before exiting the city at Bayou Manchac.

U.S. 61/190 Business runs west along Florida Boulevard (known as Florida Street from Downtown east to Mid City) from Airline Highway to River Road in downtown. The cosigned routes run from Florida St. north along River Road, passing the Louisiana State Capitol and Capitol Park Complex before intersecting with Choctaw Drive. North of this intersection River Road becomes Chippewa Street and curves to the East. U.S. 61/190 Business leaves Chippewa Street at its intersection with Scenic Highway. The route follows Scenic Highway to Airline Highway, where it ends. North of Airline on Scenic and East of Scenic Highway on Airline is US 61. U.S. 190 is East and West of Scenic on Airline Highway.

These are important surface streets with designated state highway numbers: Greenwell Springs Road (LA 37), Plank Road/22nd Street (LA 67), Burbank Drive/Highland Road (LA 42), Nicholson Drive (LA 30), Jefferson Highway/Government Street (LA 73), Scotlandville/Baker/Zachary Highway (LA 19), Essen Lane (LA 3064), Bluebonnet Blvd/Coursey Blvd (LA 1248), Siegen Lane/Sherwood Forest Blvd (LA 3246), and Perkins Road/Acadian Thruway (LA 427).

====Traffic issues and highway upgrades====
According to the 2008 INRIX National Traffic Scorecard, which ranks the top 100 congested metropolitan areas in the U.S., Baton Rouge was the 33rd-most congested metro area in the country. At a population rank of 67 out of 100, it has the second-highest ratio of population rank to congestion rank, higher than even the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana metropolitan area, indicating a remarkably high level of congestion for the comparatively low population. According to the Scorecard, Baton Rouge was the only area out of all 100 to show an increase in congestion from 2007 to 2008 (+ 6%). The city also tied for the highest jump in congestion rank over the same period (14 places).

Interstate 12 used to have a major bottleneck at O&#x27;Neal Lane. The interstate was three lanes wide in each direction to the O&#x27;Neal Lane exit, where the interstate abruptly became two lanes in each direction and crossed the narrow Amite River Bridge. This stretch of road, called &quot;a deathtrap&quot; by one lawmaker, had become notorious for traffic accidents, many with fatalities. In 2007, ten people died in traffic accidents within a three-month period on this section of road.

In 2009, Governor Bobby Jindal and the Baton Rouge legislative delegation allocated state and federal funding to widen I-12 from O&#x27;Neal Lane to Range Avenue (Exit 10) in Denham Springs. The construction was completed in 2012 and has significantly improved the flow of traffic. In 2010, The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act provided committed federal funds to widen I-12 from the Range Avenue Exit to Walker, Louisiana. Noticing the significant improvement in commute times, Jindal further funded widening to Satsuma, Louisiana.

Interstate 10 West at Bluebonnet Road also ranked within the top 1000 bottlenecks for 2008, and I-10 East at Essen Lane and Nicholson Drive ranked not far out of the top 1000. A new exit to the Mall of Louisiana was created in 2006, and the interstate was widened between Bluebonnet Blvd and Siegen Lane. But the stretch of I-10 from the I-10/I-12 split to Bluebonnet Blvd was not part of these improvements and remained heavily congested during peak hours. In response, a widening project totaling at least $87 million began in late 2008. Interstate 10 was widened to three lanes over a five-year period between the I-10/I-12 split and Highland Road. In 2010, the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act provided supplemental funding for this project to extend to the Highland Road exit in East Baton Rouge Parish.

Surface streets in Baton Rouge are prone to severe congestion. But roads are beginning to handle the number of vehicles using them after years of stagnation in road upgrades. Baton Rouge Mayor Kip Holden has instituted an extensive upgrade of East Baton Rouge Parish roads known as the Green Light Plan, geared toward improving areas of congestion on the city&#x27;s surface streets. With its first project completed in 2008, it has seen numerous others reach completion as of 2015, with several more under construction and still others yet to break ground.

A circumferential loop freeway was proposed for the greater Baton Rouge metro area to help alleviate congestion on the existing through-town routes. The proposed loop would pass through the outlying parishes of Livingston (running alongside property owned and marketed as an industrial development by Al Coburn, a member of President Mike Grimmer&#x27;s staff), Ascension, West Baton Rouge, and Iberville, as well as northern East Baton Rouge Parish. This proposal has been subject to much contention, particularly by residents living in the outer parishes through which the loop would pass.

===Commuting===
The average one-way commute time in Baton Rouge is 26.5 minutes, slightly less than the U.S. average of 27.1 minutes. Interstates 10, 110 and 12, which feed into the city, are highly traveled and connected by highways and four-lane roads that connect the downtown business area to surrounding parishes.

According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 81.9% of working Baton Rouge residents commuted by driving alone, 8.5% carpooled, 3% used public transportation, and 2.4% walked. About 1.2% used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 3.1% worked at home. In 2015, 10.4 percent of Baton Rouge households lacked a car, and increased slightly to 11.4 percent in 2016; higher than average for a city of its size. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Baton Rouge averaged 1.55 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.

===Buses and other mass transit===
Capital Area Transit System (CATS) provides urban transportation throughout Baton Rouge, including service to Southern University, Baton Rouge Community College, and Louisiana State University. Many CATS buses are equipped with bike racks for commuters to easily combine biking with bus transit. Greyhound Bus Lines, offering passenger and cargo service throughout the United States, has a downtown terminal on Florida Boulevard.

===Shipping===
The Port of Baton Rouge is the ninth-largest in the United States by tonnage shipped, and is the farthest upstream Mississippi River port capable of handling Panamax ships.

===Airport===

The Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport, located in the North Baton Rouge community of Scotlandville, is situated just 10 minutes north of downtown and nearby Baker. The airport serves as a vital transportation hub, connecting the area with the four major airline hubs that serve the southern United States. Commercial carriers include American Eagle, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines. Nonstop service is available to Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, and Charlotte.

===Rail===
Three major railroads, Canadian Pacific Kansas City, Union Pacific, and Canadian National provide railroad freight service to Baton Rouge.

The Yazoo and Mississippi Valley station had passenger service until the mid-1960s. The Kansas City Southern depot hosted the &quot;Southern Belle,&quot; the final train to serve the city, until 1969. Since 2006, Baton Rouge and New Orleans leaders as well as the state government have been pushing to secure funding for a new high-speed rail passenger line between downtown Baton Rouge and downtown New Orleans, with several stops in between. A new New Orleans–Baton Rouge passenger rail service was included as part of the &quot;Amtrak Connects US&quot; expansion vision.

<text>Annapolis ( ) is the capital of the U.S. state of Maryland. It is the county seat of Anne Arundel County and its only incorporated city. Situated on the Chesapeake Bay at the mouth of the Severn River, south of Baltimore and about east of Washington, D.C., Annapolis forms part of the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area. The 2020 census recorded its population as 40,812, an increase of 6.3% since 2010.

This city served as the seat of the Confederation Congress, formerly the Second Continental Congress, and temporary national capital of the United States in 1783–1784. At that time, General George Washington came before the body convened in the new Maryland State House and resigned his commission as commander of the Continental Army. A month later, the Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris of 1783, ending the American Revolutionary War, with Great Britain recognizing the independence of the United States.
The city and state capitol was also the site of the 1786 Annapolis Convention, which issued a call to the states to send delegates for the Constitutional Convention to be held the following year in Philadelphia. The Annapolis Peace Conference took place in 2007.

Annapolis is the home of St. John&#x27;s College, founded 1696. The United States Naval Academy, established 1845, is adjacent to the city limits.

==History==
===Colonial and early United States (1649–1808)===
A settlement in the Province of Maryland named &quot;Providence&quot; was founded on the north shore of the Severn River on the middle Western Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in 1649 by Puritan exiles from the Province/Dominion of Virginia led by the third Proprietary Governor of Maryland, William Stone (1603–1660). The settlers later moved to a better-protected harbor on the Severn&#x27;s southern shore. The settlement on the south shore, known from 1683 as &quot;Town at Proctor&#x27;s&quot;, then &quot;Town at the Severn&quot;, became in 1694 &quot;Anne Arundel&#x27;s Towne&quot; (after Lady Anne Arundell (1616–1649), the late wife of the late Cecilius Calvert, second Lord Baltimore, 1605–1675).

In 1654, after the Third English Civil War, Parliamentary forces assumed control of the Maryland colony and Stone went into exile south across the Potomac River in Virginia. Per orders from Lord Baltimore, Stone returned the following spring at the head of a Cavalier royalist force, loyal to the uncrowned King of England. On March 25, 1655, in what became known as the Battle of the Severn (the first colonial naval battle in North America), Stone was defeated, taken prisoner, and replaced by Lt. Gen. Josias Fendall (1628–1687) as fifth Proprietary Governor. Fendall governed Maryland during the latter half of the English Commonwealth period. In 1660, he was replaced by Phillip Calvert (1626–1682) as fifth/sixth Governor of Maryland, after the restoration of Charles II (1630–1685) as King in England.

In 1694, soon after the overthrow of the Catholic government of second Royal Governor Thomas Lawrence (1645–1714, in office for a few months in 1693), the third Royal Governor Francis Nicholson (1655-1727/28, in office: 1694–1698), moved the capital of the royal colony, the Province of Maryland, to Anne Arundel&#x27;s Towne and renamed the town &quot;Annapolis&quot; after Princess Anne of Denmark and Norway, soon to become Queen Anne of Great Britain (1665–1714, reigned 1702–1714). Annapolis was incorporated as a city in 1708. Colonel John Seymour, the Governor of Maryland from 1704 to 1709, wrote Queen Anne on March 16, 1709, with qualifications for municipal officials and provisions for fairs and market days for the town.
In the 17th century, Annapolis was little more than a village, but it grew rapidly for most of the 18th century until the American Revolutionary War as a political and administrative capital, a port of entry, and a major center of the Atlantic slave trade. The &quot;Maryland Gazette&quot;, which became an important weekly journal, was founded there by Jonas Green in 1745; in 1769 a theatre opened; during this period also the commerce was considerable, but it declined rapidly after Baltimore, with its deeper harbor, was made a port of entry in 1780. Water trades such as oyster-packing, boatbuilding and sailmaking became the city&#x27;s chief industries. Annapolis is home to a large number of recreational boats that have largely replaced the seafood industry in the city.
Dr. Alexander Hamilton (1712–1756), a Scottish-born doctor and writer, lived and worked in Annapolis. Leo Lemay says his 1744 travel diary &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Progress: The Itinerarium of Dr. Alexander Hamilton&quot; is &quot;the best single portrait of men and manners, of rural and urban life, of the wide range of society and scenery in colonial America.&quot;

Annapolis became the temporary capital of the United States after the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Congress was in session in the state house from November 26, 1783, to August 19, 1784, and it was in Annapolis on December 23, 1783, that General Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army.

For the 1783 Congress, the Governor of Maryland commissioned John Shaw, a local cabinetmaker, to create an American flag. Shaw&#x27;s flag is slightly different from other designs of the time: the blue field extends over the entire height of the hoist. Shaw developed two versions of the flag: one which started with a red stripe and another that started with a white one.

In 1786, delegates from all states of the Union were invited to meet in Annapolis to consider measures for the better regulation of commerce. Delegates from only five states—New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey, and Delaware—actually attended the September 1786 gathering, known afterward as the Annapolis Convention. Without proceeding to the business for which they had met, the delegates passed a resolution calling for another convention to meet at Philadelphia in the following year to amend the Articles of Confederation. The resulting Philadelphia Convention drafted and approved the Constitution of the United States, which remains in force.

=== Civil War era (1849 – late 1800s) ===
On April 24 1861, the midshipmen of the Naval Academy relocated their base in Annapolis and were temporarily housed in Newport, Rhode Island, until October 1865.

In 1861, the first of three camps that were built for holding paroled soldiers was created on the campus of St. John&#x27;s College. The second location of Camp Parole would house over 20,000 and would be located where Forest Drive is currently. The third and final location was finished in late 1863 and would be placed near the Elkridge Railroad, as to make transportation of soldiers and resources easier before and allowing the camp to grow to its highest numbers. This area just west of the city is still referred to as Parole. The soldiers who did not survive were buried in the Annapolis National Cemetery.
=== Contemporary era ===
In 1900, Annapolis had a population of 8,585. On December 21, 1906, Henry Davis was lynched in the city. He was suspected of assaulting a local woman. Nobody was ever tried for the crime.

During World War II, shipyards in Annapolis built a number of PT Boats, and military vessels such as minesweepers and patrol boats were built in Annapolis during the Korean and Vietnam wars. It was at Annapolis in July 1940 that Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg arrived in exile during World War II.

In the summer of 1984, the Navy Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis hosted soccer games as part of the XXIII Olympiad.

During September 18–19, 2003, Hurricane Isabel created the largest storm surge known in Annapolis&#x27;s history, cresting at . Much of downtown Annapolis was flooded and many businesses and homes in outlying areas were damaged. The previous record was during a hurricane in 1933, and during Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Downtown Annapolis has high-tide &quot;sunny day&quot; flooding. A Stanford University study found that this resulted in 3,000 less visits and $172,000 in lost revenue for local business in 2017.

From mid-2007 through December 2008, the city celebrated the 300th anniversary of its 1708 Royal Charter, which established democratic self-governance. The many cultural events of this celebration were organized by Annapolis Charter 300.

Annapolis was home of the Anne Arundel County Battle of the Bands, which was held at Maryland Hall from 1999 to 2015. The event was a competition between musical groups from each high school in the county; it raised over $100,000 for the county&#x27;s high school music programs during its 17-year run.

On June 28, 2018, at the Capital Gazette, a gunman opened fire, killing five journalists and injuring two more.

An EF-2 tornado struck the western edge of the city on September 1, 2021, during the remnants of Hurricane Ida. Homes, businesses, and restaurants had significant damage near Maryland Route 450, where EF-2 damage was observed with estimated winds of 125 mph. The tornado dissipated immediately past U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 301.

====2007 Annapolis Conference====

As announced by United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Annapolis was the venue for a Middle East summit dealing with the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, with the participation of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (&quot;Abu Mazen&quot;) and various other leaders from the region. The conference was held at the United States Naval Academy on November 26, 2007.

===Historic institutions===
====The State House====
The Maryland State House is the oldest in continuous legislative use in the United States. Construction started in 1772, and the Maryland legislature first met there in 1779. It is topped by the largest wooden dome built without nails in the country. The Maryland State House housed the workings of the United States government from November 26, 1783, to August 13, 1784, and the Treaty of Paris was ratified there on January 14, 1784, so Annapolis became the first peacetime capital of the U.S.

It was in the Maryland State House that George Washington famously resigned his commission before the Continental Congress on December 23, 1783.

====United States Naval Academy====

The United States Naval Academy was founded in 1845 on the site of Fort Severn, and now occupies an area of land reclaimed from the Severn River. Students that attend the Naval Academy are enrolled for four years with a following five year commitment to serving on active duty in the Marine Corps or Navy. Students hold the naval rank of Midshipman, and on average about 4,500 are enrolled.

====St. John&#x27;s College====
St. John&#x27;s College is a non-sectarian private college that was once supported by the state. It was opened in 1789 as the successor of King William&#x27;s School, which was founded by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1696 and was opened in 1701. Its principal building, McDowell Hall, was originally to be the governor&#x27;s mansion; although £4,000 was appropriated to build it in 1742, it was not completed until after the War of Independence.

==Geography==
Located south of Baltimore and east of Washington, D.C., Annapolis is the closest state capital to the national capital. In land area Annapolis (proper) is also the smallest of the United States capital cities.

===Climate===

The city is a part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and is relatively flat, with the highest point being only above sea level.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Annapolis lies within the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with hot, humid summers, cool winters, and generous precipitation year-round. Low elevation and proximity to the Chesapeake Bay give the area more moderate spring and summertime temperatures and slightly less extreme winter lows than locations further inland, such as Washington, D.C.


===Tidal flooding===

In November 2020, NASA reported that Annapolis had 18 days of high-tide (non-storm-related) flooding from May 2019 to April 2020, an increase over 2018&#x27;s 12 days, and higher than the 1995-2005 average of 2 days annually. The increase is attributed to sea level rise caused by climate change. Resultant flood damages caused local businesses to lose as much as $172,000 a year. On Naval Academy grounds, seawater came out of storm drains, with McNair Road and Ramsay Road flooding 20 times in 2020 and more than 40 times each in 2018 and 2019. Adaptation approaches such as sea walls and building up the height of roadways and athletic fields are predicted to last only a few decades.

==Arts and culture==
===Theater===
Annapolis has a thriving community theater scene which includes two venues in the historic district.

On East Street, Colonial Players produces approximately six shows a year in its 180-seat theater. &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; has been a seasonal tradition in Annapolis since it opened at the Colonial Players theater in 1981. Based on the play by Charles Dickens, the 90-minute production by the Colonial Players is an original musical adaptation, with play and lyrics by Richard Wade and music by Dick Gessner. Colonial Players, Inc. is a nonprofit organization founded in 1949. Its first production, &quot;The Male Animal&quot;, was performed in 1949 at the Annapolis Recreation Center on Compromise Street. In 1955, the organization moved to its venue in a former automotive repair shop on East Street.

During the warmer months, Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre presents three shows on its outdoor stage, which is visible from the City Dock. A nonprofit organization, Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre has been providing &quot;theatre under the stars&quot; since 1966, when it performed &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; and &quot;Brigadoon&quot; at Carvel Hall Hotel. It began leasing its site at 143 Compromise Street, the former location of the Shaw Blacksmith Shop, in 1967, and became owner of the property in 1990.

The Naval Academy Masqueraders, a theater group at the United States Naval Academy, produces one &quot;main-stage show&quot; each fall and student-directed one-act plays in the spring. Founded in 1847, the Masqueraders is the oldest extracurricular activity at the Naval Academy. Its shows, performed in Mahan Hall, are selected to support the academy&#x27;s English curriculum.

The King William Players, a student theater group at St. John&#x27;s College, holds two performances each semester in the college&#x27;s Francis Scott Key Auditorium. Admission is usually free and open to the public.

===Museums, historical sites, and monuments===

The Banneker-Douglass Museum, located in the historic Mount Moriah Church at 87 Franklin Street, documents the history of African Americans in Maryland. Since its opening on February 24, 1984, the museum has provided educational programs, rotating exhibits, and a research facility. Admission is free.

Preble Hall, named for Edward Preble, houses the U.S. Naval Academy Museum, founded in 1845. Its Beverley R. Robinson Collection contains 6,000 prints depicting European and American naval history from 1514 through World War II. It is also home to one of the world&#x27;s best ship model collections, donated by Henry Huttleston Rogers. Rogers&#x27;s donation was the impetus for the construction of Preble Hall. The museum has approximately 100,000 visitors each year.

The Hammond-Harwood House, located at 19 Maryland Avenue, was built in 1774 for Matthias Hammond, a wealthy Maryland farmer. Its design was adapted by William Buckland from Andrea Palladio&#x27;s Villa Pisani to accommodate American Colonial regional preferences. Since 1940, when the house was purchased from St. John&#x27;s College by the Hammond-Harwood House Association, it has served as a museum exhibiting a collection of John Shaw furniture and Charles Willson Peale paintings. Its exterior and interior preserve the original architecture of a mansion from the late Colonial period.

Annapolis City Dock lies at the foot of Main Street that slopes down from Church Circle and St. Anne&#x27;s Church. The dock is now a narrow waterway from Spa Creek, once named Carrol&#x27;s Creek with the dock area called Dock Cove, into the heart of the lower town. At the head of the dock is a small park with the Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Memorial with the Market House and a traffic circle in an expanse of asphalt surrounded by historic buildings. The Market House, though relatively modern, stands in a vicinity occupied by similar market houses dating to 1730 when the city market was moved from the State House area to the head of the dock. The dock itself is now used largely by recreational vessels rather than the commercial boats and boats of Chesapeake Bay watermen selling catches. The dock and surroundings are part of the Colonial Annapolis National Historic Landmark (NHL) District.

The Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley memorial, located in a park at the head of Annapolis City Dock, commemorates the arrival point of Alex Haley&#x27;s African ancestor, Kunta Kinte, whose story is related in Haley&#x27;s 1976 novel &quot;&quot;. A sculpture group at the memorial site portrays Alex Haley seated, reading from a book to three children. The final phase of the memorial&#x27;s construction was completed in 2002.

The Paca House and Garden encompasses an 18th-century Georgian mansion constructed by William Paca, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The property includes a terraced garden that has been restored to its colonial-era design.

Annapolis often serves as the end point for the 3,000-mile annual transcontinental Race Across America bicycle race.

To the north of the state house is a monument to Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice of the US Supreme Court and formerly a Maryland lawyer who won many important civil rights cases.

Located just before the Naval Academy Bridge is the World War II Memorial, which was constructed in 1998 to symbolize the sacrifice made by the 275,000 citizens from Maryland who joined the service to fight in the war. The memorial is composed of 48 granite columns to represent the 48 states at the time of the war surrounding an amphitheater in which are the names of 6,454 men who gave their lives in the war. Directly behind the memorial are both the Maryland, and United States flags, and a star shaped column with a seven sided base to represent Maryland being the seventh state in the Union.

==Sports==
On March 9, 2010, the Chesapeake Bayhawks of Major League Lacrosse moved from Washington, D.C., to the Annapolis area, at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. In 2013, the Bayhawks won the league&#x27;s championship, the Steinfeld Cup, for the fifth time.

Annapolis Blues FC is a men&#x27;s amateur soccer team that plays in USL League Two, which also competes out of Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium.

==Government==
===City government===

Annapolis is governed via the weak mayor system. The city council consists of eight aldermen who are elected from single member wards. The mayor is elected directly in a citywide vote. Since 2008, several aldermen have introduced unsuccessful charter amendments to institute a council-manager system, a move opposed by both Democratic mayor Joshua J. Cohen and his Republican successor Mike Pantelides.

===State government===
The state legislature, governor&#x27;s office, and appellate courts are located in Annapolis. While Annapolis is the state&#x27;s only capital, some administrative offices, including a number of cabinet-level departments, are based in Baltimore.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Roads and highways====

No major highways enter the city limits of Annapolis. Just outside the city limits, Interstate 595/U.S. Route 50/U.S. Route 301 traverses the region on an east–west route, connecting the Annapolis area to Washington, D.C., and the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Interstate 97 interchanges with I-595/US 50/US 301 a few miles west of Annapolis and provides the most direct link to Baltimore. Maryland Route 2 also passes just outside the city limits and is the best connection to Southern Maryland, while also providing an alternate route to Baltimore.

The most prominent roads directly accessing the city include Maryland Route 70, which connects downtown Annapolis to US 50/US 301, and Maryland Route 665, which does likewise for the southwestern portions of the city. Other state highways serving Annapolis include Maryland Route 181, Maryland Route 387, Maryland Route 393, Maryland Route 435, Maryland Route 436, Maryland Route 450, Maryland Route 788 and Maryland Route 797.

====Bus====
The Annapolis Department of Transportation (ADOT) provides bus service with eight routes, collectively branded Annapolis Transit. The system serves the city with recreational areas, shopping centers, educational and medical facilities, and employment hubs. ADOT also offers transportation for the elderly and persons with disabilities. Several Maryland Transit Administration commuter buses also allow for access to Baltimore or Washington, D.C.

====Railway====
From 1840 to 1968, Annapolis was connected to the outside world by railroad. The Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (WB&amp;A) operated two electrified interurban lines that brought passengers into the city from both the South and the North. The southern route ran down King George Street and Main Street, leading directly to the statehouse, while the northern route entered town via Glen Burnie. In 1935, the WB&amp;A went bankrupt due to the effects of the Great Depression and suspended service along its southern route, while the newly created Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad (B&amp;A) retained service on the northern route. Steam trains of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad also occasionally operated over the line to Annapolis, primarily for special Naval Academy movements. Passenger rail service on the B&amp;A was eventually discontinued in 1950; freight service ceased in 1968 after the dilapidated trestle crossing the Severn River was condemned. The tracks were eventually dismantled in 1976.

<text>Jefferson City, informally Jeff City, is the capital of the U.S. state of Missouri. It had a population of 43,228 at the 2020 United States census, ranking as the 16th most populous city in the state, but the 9th least populous U.S. state capital. It is also the county seat of Cole County and the principal city of the Jefferson City Metropolitan Statistical Area, the second-most-populous metropolitan area in Mid-Missouri and the fifth-most populous in the state. It part of the 9-county Columbia–Jefferson City–Moberly combined statistical area with 415,747 residents. Most of the city is in Cole County, with a small northern section extending into adjacent Callaway County.

Jefferson City is named for Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), the third President of the United States, 1801–1809, and earlier major author of the Declaration of Independence of the United States on July 4, 1776. He also served several diplomatic posts overseas in Europe and was the first U.S. Secretary of State (1790-1793) in the first President&#x27;s Cabinet of George Washington, and subsequently the second Vice President (1797-1801) under second chief executive John Adams.

Jefferson City is located on the northern edge of the Ozark Plateau on the southern side of the Missouri River in a region known as Mid-Missouri, that is roughly mid-way between the state&#x27;s two large urban areas of Kansas City to the west and St. Louis in the east (along the west bank of the Mississippi River). It is south of Columbia, Missouri, and sits at the western edge of the Missouri Rhineland, one of the major wine-producing regions of the Midwest. The city is dominated by the monumental domed Missouri State Capitol, which rises from a bluff overlooking the nearby Missouri River to the north; Lewis and Clark with their Corps of Discovery passed the bluff here on their historic expedition upriver in 1804, eventually journeying westward to the Pacific Northwest region and the Pacific Ocean, before Europeans or Americans established any settlement there.

Many of Jefferson City&#x27;s primary employers are in service and manufacturing industries. Jefferson City is also home to Lincoln University, a public historically black and federal land-grant university founded the year after the American Civil War in 1866, by the Union Army black veterans of the First Missouri Regiment of Colored Infantry &amp; 62nd Regiment of U.S. Colored Troops with support from the Second Missouri Regiment of Colored Infantry / 65th Regiment of U.S. Colored Troops.

==History==


In pre-Columbian times, this region was home of an ancient people known only as the &quot;Mound Builders&quot;, being replaced by Osage Native Americans. In the late 17th century, frontiersmen started to inhabit the area, including Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, Louis Jolliet, Jacques Marquette, Robert de LaSalle, and Daniel Boone, with the latter having the greatest influence on the region. Famed Western explorer and settler Daniel Boone&#x27;s son, Daniel Morgan Boone (1769-1839), would later lay out and plat Jefferson City in the early 19th century.

When the Missouri Territory was organized in 1812, St. Louis was Missouri&#x27;s seat of government for the territorial governor and territorial legislature. Later St. Charles would serve as the next capital town of the old Territory. However, Jefferson City was chosen as the new state capital in 1821, after Missouri was admitted to the Union as the 24th State. The village on the southern banks of the Missouri River, first was called &quot;Lohman&#x27;s Landing&quot;, and when the new state legislature decided to relocate there, they proposed the name &quot;Missouriopolis&quot; before settling on the city of &quot;Jefferson&quot; to honor former third President Thomas Jefferson (who was still living at his Virginia home estate of Monticello for the next five years). Over the years, the city was most often referred to as &quot;Jefferson City&quot; and the common name stuck. For years, this village was little more than a trading post located in the wilderness about midway between St. Louis and Kansas City. In 1825, the settlement was incorporated as a town / city and a year later, the state legislature of the General Assembly of Missouri, moved to and first met in Jefferson City.

Jefferson City was also chosen by the lawmakers as the site of a state prison. This prison, named the Missouri State Penitentiary, opened in 1836. This prison was the unfortunate home to multiple infamous Americans, including former heavyweight boxing champion Sonny Liston, Martin Luther King Jr. assassin James Earl Ray, and infamous 1930s bank robber Pretty Boy Floyd.

During the American Civil War (1861-1865), Jefferson City was occupied by Union / Federal troops and the elected state legislature of the General Assembly were driven from Jefferson City by Union Army General Nathaniel Lyon (1818-1861). Some of the rebelling legislators later reconvened in nearby Neosho and passed an ordinance of secession from the Federal Union. Missouri was claimed by both the southern Confederacy and the Federal Union of the remaining United States, as was neighboring border state of Kentucky to the east, also split by the impending conflict of civil war. Missourians were strongly divided and many people in the state—especially in St. Louis—supported the Union, while other areas of the state (such as Missouri&#x27;s Little Dixie) were strongly pro-Confederate further west along the Missouri River between Jefferson City and Kansas City.

German immigrants created vineyards in small towns on either side of the Missouri River, especially on the north from the city east to Marthasville, located outside of St. Louis. Known as the &quot;Missouri Rhineland&quot; for its vineyards and first established by German immigrants in the mid-1800s, this region has become part of Missouri&#x27;s agricultural and tourist economy.

The State Capitol is located in Jefferson City. In addition, state agencies are headquartered in Jefferson City. The Missouri State Archives is located in Jefferson City.

The Missouri Department of Corrections (MDOC) operates the Jefferson City Correctional Center (JCCC) and the Algoa Correctional Center (ACC) in Jefferson City. JCCC replaced the Missouri State Penitentiary on September 15, 2004, which until its closure was the oldest operating penal facility west of the Mississippi River. It served as the State of Missouri&#x27;s primary maximum security institution, and it housed male death row prisoners until April 1989, when they were moved to the Potosi Correctional Center.

===Federal government===
The United States Postal Service operates several postal facilities. The Jefferson City Main Post Office building previously shared occupancy with the U.S. District Court from its dedication in November 1934 until September 27, 2011, when it moved into the Christopher S. Bond Court House.

The 118,000-square-foot courthouse is named for the former Governor and United States Senator from Missouri. The courthouse, which is occupied by the Central Division of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri and under the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, was designed to achieve the U.S. Green Building Council&#x27;s LEED Gold rating. Sustainable design features include reducing water use by 44 percent, using 13 percent recycled content, diverting 80 percent of construction waste materials from landfills, and it is 36 percent more efficient than current energy standards.
