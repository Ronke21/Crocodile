<text>The Situationist International (SI) was an international organization of social revolutionaries made up of avant-garde artists, intellectuals, and political theorists. It was prominent in Europe from its formation in 1957 to its dissolution in 1972. The intellectual foundations of the Situationist International were derived primarily from libertarian Marxism and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century, particularly Dada and Surrealism. Overall, situationist theory represented an attempt to synthesize this diverse field of theoretical disciplines into a modern and comprehensive critique of mid-20th century advanced capitalism.

Essential to situationist theory was the concept of the spectacle, a unified critique of advanced capitalism of which a primary concern was the progressively increasing tendency towards the expression and mediation of social relations through images. The situationists believed that the shift from individual expression through directly lived experiences, or the first-hand fulfillment of authentic desires, to individual expression by proxy through the exchange or consumption of commodities, or passive second-hand alienation, inflicted significant and far-reaching damage to the quality of human life for both individuals and society. Another important concept of situationist theory was the primary means of counteracting the spectacle; the construction of situations, moments of life deliberately constructed for the purpose of reawakening and pursuing authentic desires, experiencing the feeling of life and adventure, and the liberation of everyday life.

The situationists recognized that capitalism had changed since Karl Marx&#x27;s formative writings, but maintained that his analysis of the capitalist mode of production remained fundamentally correct; they rearticulated and expanded upon several classical Marxist concepts, such as his theory of alienation. In their expanded interpretation of Marxist theory, the situationists asserted that the misery of social alienation and commodity fetishism were no longer limited to the fundamental components of capitalist society, but had now in advanced capitalism spread themselves to every aspect of life and culture. They rejected the idea that advanced capitalism&#x27;s apparent successes—such as technological advancement, increased productive capacity, and a raised general quality of life when compared to previous systems, such as feudalism—could ever outweigh the social dysfunction and degradation of everyday life that it simultaneously inflicted.

When the Situationist International was first formed, it had a predominantly artistic focus; emphasis was placed on concepts like unitary urbanism and psychogeography. Gradually, however, that focus shifted more towards revolutionary and political theory. The Situationist International reached the apex of its creative output and influence in 1967 and 1968, with the former marking the publication of the two most significant texts of the situationist movement, &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; by Guy Debord and &quot;The Revolution of Everyday Life&quot; by Raoul Vaneigem. The expressed writing and political theory of the two aforementioned texts, along with other situationist publications, proved greatly influential in shaping the ideas behind the May 1968 insurrections in France; quotes, phrases, and slogans from situationist texts and publications were ubiquitous on posters and graffiti throughout France during the uprisings.

==Etymology and usage==
The term &quot;situationist&quot; refers to the construction of situations, one of the early central concepts of the Situationist International; the term also refers to any individuals engaged in the construction of situations, or, more narrowly, to members of the Situationist International. Situationist theory sees the situation as a tool for the liberation of everyday life, a method of negating the pervasive alienation that accompanied the spectacle. The founding manifesto of the Situationist International, &quot;Report on the Construction of Situations&quot; (1957), defined the construction of situations as &quot;the concrete construction of momentary ambiances of life and their transformation into a superior quality.&quot; &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot; No. 1 (June 1958) defined the constructed situation as &quot;a moment of life concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a and a game of events&quot;. The situationists argued that advanced capitalism manufactured false desires; literally in the sense of ubiquitous advertising and the glorification of accumulated capital, and more broadly in the abstraction and reification of the more ephemeral experiences of authentic life into commodities. The experimental direction of situationist activity consisted of setting up temporary environments favorable to the fulfillment of true and authentic human desires in response.

The Situationist International strongly resisted use of the term &quot;situationism&quot;, which Debord called a &quot;meaningless term&quot;, adding &quot;[t]here is no such thing as situationism, which would mean a doctrine for interpreting existing conditions&quot;. The situationists maintained a philosophical opposition to all ideologies, conceiving of them as abstract superstructures ultimately serving only to justify the economic base of a given society; accordingly, they rejected &quot;situationism&quot; as an absurd and self-contradictory concept. In &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot;, Debord asserted that ideology was &quot;the abstract will to universality and the illusion thereof&quot; which was &quot;legitimated in modern society by universal abstraction and by the effective dictatorship of illusion&quot;.

==History==

===Origins (1945–1955)===
The situationist movement had its origins as a left wing tendency within Lettrism, an artistic and literary movement led by the Romanian-born French poet and visual artist Isidore Isou, originating in 1940s Paris. The group was heavily influenced by the preceding avant-garde movements of Dadaism and Surrealism, seeking to apply critical theories based on these concepts to all areas of art and culture, most notably in poetry, film, painting and political theory. Among some of the concepts and artistic innovations developed by the Lettrists were the &quot;lettrie&quot;, a poem reflecting pure form yet devoid of all semantic content, new syntheses of writing and visual art identified as metagraphics and hypergraphics, as well as new creative techniques in filmmaking. Future situationist Guy Debord, who was at that time a significant figure in the Lettrist movement, helped develop these new film techniques, using them in his Lettrist film &quot;Howlings for Sade&quot; (1952) as well as later in his situationist film &quot;Society of the Spectacle&quot; (1972).

By 1950, a much younger and more left-wing part of the Lettrist movement began to emerge. This group kept very active in perpetrating public outrages such as the Notre-Dame Affair, where at the Easter High Mass at Notre Dame de Paris, in front of ten thousand people and broadcast on national TV, their member and former Dominican Michel Mourre posed as a monk, &quot;stood in front of the altar and read a pamphlet proclaiming that God was dead&quot;. André Breton prominently came out in support of the action in a letter that spawned a large debate in the newspaper &quot;Combat&quot;.

In 1952, this left wing of the Lettrist movement, which included Debord, broke off from Isou&#x27;s group and formed the Letterist International, a new Paris-based collective of avant-garde artists and political theorists. The schism finally erupted when the future members of the radical Lettrists disrupted a Charlie Chaplin press conference for &quot;Limelight&quot; at the Hôtel Ritz Paris. They distributed a polemic entitled &quot;No More Flat Feet!&quot;, which concluded: &quot;The footlights have melted the make-up of the supposedly brilliant mime. All we can see now is a lugubrious and mercenary old man. Go home Mister Chaplin.&quot; Isou was upset with this, his own attitude being that Chaplin deserved respect as one of the great creators of the cinematic art. The breakaway group felt that his work was no longer relevant, while having appreciated it &quot;in its own time,&quot; and asserted their belief &quot;that the most urgent expression of freedom is the destruction of idols, especially when they claim to represent freedom,&quot; in this case, filmmaker Charlie Chaplin.

During this period of the Letterist International, many of the important concepts and ideas that would later be integral in situationist theory were developed. Individuals in the group collaboratively constructed the new field of psychogeography, which they defined as &quot;the study of the specific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals.&quot; Debord further expanded this concept of psychogeography with his theory of the dérive, an unplanned tour through an urban landscape directed entirely by the feelings evoked in the individual by their surroundings, serving as the primary means for mapping and investigating the psychogeography of these different areas. During this period the Letterist International also developed the situationist tactic of détournement, which by reworking or re-contextualizing an existing work of art or literature sought to radically shift its meaning to one with revolutionary significance.

===Formation (1956–1957)===

In 1956, Guy Debord, a member of the Lettrist International, and Asger Jorn of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, brought together a group of artistic collectives for the &quot;First World Congress of Free Artists&quot; in Alba, Italy. The meeting established the foundation for the development of the Situationist International, which was officially formed in July 1957 at a meeting in Cosio di Arroscia, Italy. The resulting International was a fusion of these extremely small avant-garde collectives: the Lettrist International, the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus (an offshoot of COBRA), and the London Psychogeographical Association (though, Anselm Jappe has argued that the group pivoted around Jorn and Debord for the first four years). Later, the Situationist International drew ideas from other groups such as &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot;.

The most prominent member of the group, Guy Debord, generally became considered the organization&#x27;s de facto leader and most distinguished theorist. Other members included theorist Raoul Vaneigem, the Dutch painter Constant Nieuwenhuys, the Italo-Scottish writer Alexander Trocchi, the English artist Ralph Rumney (sole member of the London Psychogeographical Association, Rumney suffered expulsion relatively soon after the formation), the Danish artist Asger Jorn (who after parting with the SI also founded the Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism), the architect and veteran of the Hungarian Uprising Attila Kotanyi, and the French writer Michèle Bernstein. Debord and Bernstein later married.

In June 1957, Debord wrote the manifesto of the Situationist International, titled &quot;Report on the Construction of Situations&quot;. This manifesto plans a rereading of Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot; and advocates a cultural revolution in western countries.

===Artistic period (1958–1962)===
During the first few years of the SI&#x27;s founding, avant-garde artistic groups began collaborating with the SI and joining the organization. Gruppe SPUR, a German artistic collective, collaborated with the Situationist International on projects beginning in 1959, continuing until the group officially joined the SI in 1961. The role of the artists in the SI was of great significance, particularly Asger Jorn, Constant Nieuwenhuys and Pinot Gallizio.

Asger Jorn, who invented Situgraphy and Situlogy, had the social role of catalyst and team leader among the members of the SI between 1957 and 1961. Jorn&#x27;s role in the situationist movement (as in COBRA) was that of a catalyst and team leader. Guy Debord on his own lacked the personal warmth and persuasiveness to draw people of different nationalities and talents into an active working partnership. As a prototype Marxist intellectual Debord needed an ally who could patch up the petty egoisms and squabbles of the members. When Jorn&#x27;s leadership was withdrawn in 1961, many simmering quarrels among different sections of the SI flared up, leading to multiple exclusions.

The first major split was the exclusion of Gruppe SPUR, the German section, from the SI on 10 February 1962. Many different disagreements led to the fracture, for example; while at the Fourth SI Conference in London in December 1960, in a discussion about the political nature of the SI, the Gruppe SPUR members disagreed with the core situationist stance of counting on a revolutionary proletariat; the accusation that their activities were based on a &quot;systematic misunderstanding of situationist theses&quot;; the understanding that at least one Gruppe SPUR member, sculptor Lothar Fischer, and possibly the rest of the group, were not actually understanding and/or agreeing with the situationist ideas, but were just using the SI to achieve success in the art market; and the betrayal, in the &quot;Spur #7&quot; issue, of a common agreement on the Gruppe SPUR and SI publications.

The exclusion was a recognition that Gruppe SPUR&#x27;s &quot;principles, methods and goals&quot; were significantly in contrast with those of the SI. This split however was not a declaration of hostilities, as in other cases of SI exclusions. A few months after the exclusion, in the context of judicial prosecution against the group by the German state, Debord expressed his esteem to Gruppe SPUR, calling it the only significant artist group in (Germany) since World War II, and regarding it at the level of the avant-gardes in other countries.

The next significant split was in 1962, wherein the &quot;Nashists,&quot; the Scandinavian section of the SI led by Jørgen Nash, were excluded from the organization. Nash created the 2nd Situationist International.

===Political period (1963–1968)===

By this point the Situationist International consisted almost exclusively of the Franco-Belgian section, led by Guy Debord and Raoul Vaneigem. These members possessed much more of a tendency towards political theory over the more artistic aspects of the SI. The shift in the intellectual priorities within the SI resulted in more focus on the theoretical, such as the theory of the spectacle and Marxist critical analysis, spending much less time on the more artistic and tangible concepts like unitary urbanism, détournement, and situgraphy.

During this period, the SI began having more and more influence on local university students in France. Taking advantage of the apathy of their colleagues, five &quot;Pro-situs&quot;, situationist-influenced students, infiltrated the University of Strasbourg&#x27;s student union in November 1966 and began scandalising the authorities. Their first action was to form an &quot;anarchist appreciation society&quot; called The Society for the Rehabilitation for Karl Marx and Ravachol; next they appropriated union funds to flypost &quot;Return of the Durruti Column&quot;, André Bertrand&#x27;s &quot;détourned&quot; comic strip. They then invited the situationists to contribute a critique of the University of Strasbourg, and &quot;On the Poverty of Student Life&quot;, written by Tunisian situationist Mustapha/Omar Khayati was the result. The students promptly proceeded to print 10,000 copies of the pamphlet using university funds and distributed them during a ceremony marking the beginning of the academic year. This provoked an immediate outcry in the local, national and international media.

===May events (1968)===
The Situationists played a preponderant role in the May 1968 uprisings, and to some extent their political perspective and ideas fueled such crisis, providing a central theoretic foundation. While SI&#x27;s member count had been steadily falling for the preceding several years, the ones that remained were able to fill revolutionary roles for which they had patiently anticipated and prepared. The active ideologists (&quot;enragés&quot; and Situationists) behind the revolutionary events in Strasbourg, Nanterre and Paris, numbered only about one or two dozen persons.

This has now been widely acknowledged as a fact by studies of the period, what is still wide open to interpretation is the &quot;how and why&quot; that happened. Charles de Gaulle, in the aftermath televised speech of 7 June, acknowledged that &quot;This explosion was provoked by groups in revolt against modern consumer and technical society, whether it be the communism of the East or the capitalism of the West.&quot;

They also made up the majority in the Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne. An important event leading up to May 1968 was the scandal in Strasbourg in December 1966. The Union Nationale des Étudiants de France declared itself in favor of the SI&#x27;s theses, and managed to use public funds to publish Mustapha Khayati&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;On the Poverty of Student Life&quot;. Thousands of copies of the pamphlet were printed and circulated and helped to make the Situationists well known throughout the nonstalinist left.

Quotations from two key situationist books, Debord&#x27;s &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; (1967) and Khayati&#x27;s &quot;On the Poverty of Student Life&quot; (1966), were written on the walls of Paris and several provincial cities. This was documented in the collection of photographs published in 1968 by Walter Lewino, &quot;L&#x27;imagination au pouvoir&quot;.

Though the SI were a very small group, they were expert self-propagandists, and their slogans appeared daubed on walls throughout Paris at the time of the revolt. SI member René Viénet&#x27;s 1968 book &quot;Enragés and Situationists in the Occupations Movement, France, May &#x27;68&quot; gives an account of the involvement of the SI with the student group of Enragés and the occupation of the Sorbonne.

The occupations of 1968 started at the University of Nanterre and spread to the Sorbonne. The police tried to take back the Sorbonne and a riot ensued. Following this a general strike was declared with up to 10 million workers participating. The SI originally participated in the Sorbonne occupations and defended barricades in the riots. The SI distributed calls for the occupation of factories and the formation of workers&#x27; councils, but, disillusioned with the students, left the university to set up the Council for Maintaining the Occupations (CMDO) which distributed the SI&#x27;s demands on a much wider scale. After the end of the movement, the CMDO disbanded.

===Aftermath (1968–1972)===
By 1972, Gianfranco Sanguinetti and Guy Debord were the only two remaining members of the SI. Working with Debord, in August 1975, Sanguinetti wrote a pamphlet titled &quot;Rapporto veridico sulle ultime opportunità di salvare il capitalismo in Italia&quot; (&quot;The Real Report on the Last Chance to Save Capitalism in Italy&quot;), which (inspired by Bruno Bauer) purported to be the cynical writing of &quot;Censor&quot;, a powerful industrialist. The pamphlet argued that the ruling class of Italy supported the Piazza Fontana bombing and other covert, false flag mass slaughter for the higher goal of defending the capitalist status quo from communist influence. The pamphlet was mailed to 520 of Italy&#x27;s most powerful individuals. It was received as genuine and powerful politicians, industrialists and journalists praised its content. After reprinting the tract as a small book, Sanguinetti revealed himself to be the true author. In the outcry that ensued and under pressure from Italian authorities Sanguinetti left Italy in February 1976, and was denied entry to France.

After publishing in the last issue of the magazine, an analysis of the May 1968 revolts and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions, the SI was dissolved in 1972.

==Main concepts==

===The spectacle and its society===
The &quot;Spectacle&quot; is a central notion in situationist theory, developed by Guy Debord in his 1967 book, &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot;. In a limited sense, &quot;spectacle&quot; includes the mass media, which are &quot;its most glaring superficial manifestation.&quot; Debord said that the society of the spectacle came to existence in the late 1920s.

The critique of the &quot;spectacle&quot; is a development and application of Karl Marx&#x27;s concept of fetishism of commodities, reification and alienation, and the way it was reprised by György Lukács in 1923. In the society of the spectacle, the commodities rule the workers and the consumers instead of being ruled by them. The consumers are passive subjects that contemplate the reified spectacle.

As early as 1958, in the situationist manifesto, Debord described official culture as a &quot;rigged game&quot;, where conservative powers forbid subversive ideas to have direct access to the public discourse. Such ideas get first trivialized and sterilized, and then they are safely incorporated back within mainstream society, where they can be exploited to add new flavors to old dominant ideas. This technique of the spectacle is sometimes called &quot;recuperation&quot;, and its counter-technique is the &quot;détournement&quot;.

===Détournement===

A &quot;détournement&quot; is a technique developed in the 1950s by the Letterist International, and consist in &quot;turning expressions of the capitalist system against itself,&quot; like turning slogans and logos against the advertisers or the political status quo. &quot;Détournement&quot; was prominently used to set up subversive political pranks, an influential tactic called situationist prank that was reprised by the punk movement in the late 1970s and inspired the culture jamming movement in the late 1980s.

===Anti-capitalism===
The Situationist International, in the 15 years from its formation in 1957 and its dissolution in 1972, is characterized by a Marxist and surrealist perspective on aesthetics and politics, without separation between the two: art and politics are faced together and in revolutionary terms. The SI analyzed the modern world from the point of view of everyday life. The core arguments of the Situationist International were an attack on the capitalist degradation of the life of people and the fake models advertised by the mass media, to which the Situationist responded with alternative life experiences. The alternative life experiences explored by the Situationists were the construction of situations, unitary urbanism, psychogeography, and the union of play, freedom and critical thinking.

A major stance of the SI was to count on the force of a revolutionary proletariat. This stance was reaffirmed very clearly in a discussion on &quot;To what extent is the SI a political movement?&quot;, during the Fourth SI Conference in London. The SI remarked that this is a core Situationist principle, and that those that don&#x27;t understand it and agree with it, are not Situationist.

===Art and politics===

The SI rejected all art that separated itself from politics, the concept of 20th-century art that is separated from topical political events. The SI believed that the notion of artistic expression being separated from politics and current events is one proliferated by reactionary considerations to render artwork that expresses comprehensive critiques of society impotent. They recognized there was a precise mechanism followed by reactionaries to defuse the role of subversive artists and intellectuals, that is, to reframe them as separated from the most topical events, and divert from them the taste for the new that may dangerously appeal the masses; after such separation, such artworks are sterilized, banalized, degraded, and can be safely integrated into the official culture and the public discourse, where they can add new flavors to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of the society of the spectacle.

According to this theory, artists and intellectuals that accept such compromises are rewarded by the art dealers and praised by the dominant culture. The SI received many offers to sponsor &quot;creations&quot; that would just have a &quot;situationist&quot; label but a diluted political content, that would have brought things back to order and the SI back into the old fold of artistic praxis. The majority of SI continued to refuse such offers and any involvement on the conventional avant-garde artistic plane. This principle was affirmed since the founding of the SI in 1957, but the qualitative step of resolving all the contradictions of having situationists that make concessions to the cultural market, was made with the exclusion of Gruppe SPUR in 1962.

The SI noted how reactionary forces forbid subversive ideas from artists and intellectuals to reach the public discourse, and how they attack the artworks that express comprehensive critique of society, by saying that art should not involve itself into politics.

===The construction of situations===
The first edition of &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot; defines the constructed situation as &quot;a moment of life concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a unitary ambiance and a game of events.&quot;

As the SI embraced dialectical Marxism, the situation came to refer less to a specific avant-garde practice than to the dialectical unification of art and life more generally. Beyond this theoretical definition, the situation as a practical manifestation thus slipped between a series of proposals. The SI thus were first led to distinguish the situation from the mere artistic practice of the happening, and later identified it in historical events such as the Paris Commune in which it exhibited itself as the revolutionary moment. The SI&#x27;s interest in the Paris Commune was expressed in 1962 in their fourteen &quot;Theses on the Paris Commune.&quot;

===Psychogeography===

The first edition of &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot; defined psychogeography as &quot;the study of the specific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals.&quot; The term was first recognized in 1955 by Guy Debord while still with the Letterist International:The word psychogeography, suggested by an illiterate Kabyle as a general term for the phenomena a few of us were investigating around the summer of 1953, is not too inappropriate. It does not contradict the materialist perspective of the conditioning of life and thought by objective nature. Geography, for example, deals with the determinant action of general natural forces, such as soil composition or climatic conditions, on the economic structures of a society, and thus on the corresponding conception that such a society can have of the world. Psychogeography could set for itself the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, whether consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals. The charmingly vague adjective psychogeographical can be applied to the findings arrived at by this type of investigation, to their influence on human feelings, and more generally to any situation or conduct that seems to reflect the same spirit of discovery.

====Dérive====

By definition, psychogeography combines subjective and objective knowledge and studies. Debord struggled to stipulate the finer points of this theoretical paradox, ultimately producing &quot;Theory of the Dérive&quot; in 1958, a document which essentially serves as an instruction manual for the psychogeographic procedure, executed through the act of dérive (&quot;drift&quot;).

SI engaged in a play-form that was also
practiced by its predecessor organization, the Lettrist International, the art of wandering through urban space, which they termed dérive, whose unique mood is conveyed in Debord&#x27;s darkly romantic meaning of palindrome. Two excursions organized by Andre Breton serve as the closest cultural precedents to the dérive. The first in 1921, was an excursion to the Church of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre with the Parisian Dadaists; the second excursion was on 1 May 1923, when a small group of Surrealists walked toward the countryside outside of Blois. Debord was cautious however to differentiate between the derive and such precedents. He emphasized its active character as &quot;a mode of experimental behavior&quot; that reached to Romanticism, the Baroque, and the age of chivalry, with its tradition of long adventures voyages. Such urban roaming was characteristic of Left Bank bohemianism in Paris.

In the SI&#x27;s 6th issue, Raoul Vaneigem writes in a manifesto of unitary urbanism, &quot;All space is occupied by the enemy. We are living under a permanent curfew. Not just the cops—the geometry&quot;. Dérive, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was &quot;a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus&quot;, and &quot;a maneuver within the enemy&#x27;s field of vision&quot;. To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the dérive brought appeal in this sense of taking the &quot;fight&quot; to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation. The dérive was a course of preparation, reconnaissance, a means of shaping situationist psychology among urban explorers for the eventuality of the situationist city.

==Political theory==

===Major works===
Twelve issues of the main French edition of journal &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot; were published, each issue edited by a different individual or group, including: Guy Debord, Hadj Mohamed Dahou, Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio, Maurice Wyckaert, Constant Nieuwenhuys, Asger Jorn, Helmut Sturm, Attila Kotanyi, Jørgen Nash, Uwe Lausen, Raoul Vaneigem, Michèle Bernstein, Jeppesen Victor Martin, Jan Strijbosch, Alexander Trocchi, Théo Frey, Mustapha Khayati, Donald Nicholson-Smith, René Riesel, and René Viénet.

Classic Situationist texts include: &quot;On the Poverty of Student Life&quot;, &quot;Society of the Spectacle&quot; by Guy Debord, and &quot;The Revolution of Everyday Life&quot; by Raoul Vaneigem.

The first English-language collection of SI writings, although poorly and freely translated, was &quot;Leaving The 20th century&quot; edited by Christopher Gray. &quot;The Situationist International Anthology&quot; edited and translated by Ken Knabb, collected numerous SI documents which had previously never been seen in English.

===Relationship with Marxism===
Rooted firmly in the Marxist tradition, the Situationist International criticized Trotskyism, Marxism–Leninism, Stalinism and Maoism from a position they believed to be further left and more properly Marxist. The situationists possessed a strong anti-authoritarian current, commonly deriding the centralized bureaucracies of China and the Soviet Union in the same breath as capitalism.

Debord&#x27;s work &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; (1967) established situationist analysis as Marxist critical theory. &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; is widely recognized as the main and most influential Situationist essay.

The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International was anti-capitalist, Marxist, Young Hegelian, and from the very beginning in the 50s, remarkably differently from the established Left, anti-Stalinist and against all repressive regimes.

Debord starts his 1967 work with a revisited version of the first sentence with which Marx began his critique of classical political economy, &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. In a later essay, Debord will argue that his work was the most important social critique since Marx&#x27;s work. Drawing from Marx, which argued that under a capitalist society the &quot;wealth&quot; is degraded to an immense accumulation of commodities, Debord argues that in advanced capitalism, life is reduced to an immense accumulation of spectacles, a triumph of mere appearance where &quot;all that once was directly lived has become mere representation&quot;. The spectacle, which according to Debord is the core feature of the advanced capitalist societies, has its &quot;most glaring superficial manifestation&quot; in the advertising-mass media-marketing complex.

Elaborating on Marx&#x27;s argument that under capitalism our lives and our environment are continually depleted, Debord adds that the Spectacle is the system by which capitalism tries to hide such depletion. Debord added that, further than the impoverishment in the quality of life, our psychic functions are altered, we get a degradation of mind and also a degradation of knowledge. In the spectacular society, knowledge is not used anymore to question, analyze, or resolve contradictions, but to assuage reality.

Situationist theorists advocated methods of operation that included democratic workers&#x27; councils and workers&#x27; self-management, interested in empowering the individual, in contrast to the perceived corrupt bureaucratic states of the Eastern bloc. Their anti-authoritarian interpretation of Marxist theory can be identified with the broader council communist and libertarian Marxist movements, themselves more broadly termed as left communism.

The last issue (1969) of the &quot;Situationist International&quot; journal, featured an editorial analyzing the events of May 1968. The editorial, written by Guy Debord, was titled &quot;The Beginning of an Era&quot;, probably as a détournement reference of &quot;Nachalo&quot; (&quot;The Beginning&quot;), a Russian Marxist monthly magazine.

According to Greil Marcus, some found similarities between the Situationists and the Yippies.

Former situationists T. J. Clark and Donald Nicholson-Smith (British section), argued that the portion of the moderate Left that is the &quot;established Left&quot;, and its &quot;Left opinion-makers&quot;, usually addressed contemptuously the SI as &quot;hopelessly young-Hegelian&quot;.

===Relationship with anarchism===
The Situationist International was differentiated from both anarchists and Marxists. In spite of this, they have frequently been associated with anarchism. Debord did a critical assessment of the anarchists in his 1967 &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot;. In the final, 12th issue of the journal, the situationists rejected spontaneism and the &quot;mystics of nonorganization,&quot; labeling them as a form of &quot;sub-anarchism&quot;:

According to situationist Ken Knabb, Debord pointed out the flaws and merits of both Marxism and anarchism. He argued that &quot;the split between Marxism and anarchism crippled both sides. The anarchists rightly criticized the authoritarian and narrowly economistic tendencies in Marxism, but they generally did so in an undialectical, moralistic, ahistorical manner... and leaving Marx and a few of the more radical Marxists with a virtual monopoly on coherent dialectical analysis—until the situationists finally brought the libertarian and dialectical aspects back together again.&quot;

===Relationship with the established left===
The SI poses a challenge to the model of political action of a portion of the left, the &quot;established Left&quot; and &quot;Left opinion-makers&quot;. The first challenging aspect is the fueling role that the SI had in the upheavals of the political and social movements of the 1960s, upheavals for which much is still at stake and which many foresee as recurring in the 21st century. The second challenging aspect, is the comparison between the Situationist Marxist theory of the Society of the Spectacle, which is still very topical 30 years later, and the current status of the theories supported by leftist establishments in the same period, like Althusserianism, Maoism, Autonomism, Freudo-Marxism and others.

The response to this challenge has been an attempt to silence and misinterpret, to &quot;turn the SI safely into an art movement, and thereby to minimize its role in the political and social movements of the sixties&quot;.

The core aspect of the revolutionary perspectives, and the political theory, of the Situationist International, has been neglected by some commentators, which either limited themselves to an apolitical reading of the situationist avant-garde art works, or dismissed the Situationist political theory. Examples of this are Simon Sadler&#x27;s &quot;The Situationist City&quot;, and the accounts on the SI published by the &quot;New Left Review&quot;.

The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International was anti-capitalist, Marxist, Young Hegelian, and from the very beginning in the 1950s, remarkably differently from the established Left, anti-Stalinist and against all repressive regimes. The SI called in May 1968 for the formation of workers&#x27; councils.

There was no separation between the artistic and the political perspectives. For instance, Asger Jorn never believed in a conception of the Situationist ideas as exclusively artistic and separated from political involvement. He was at the root and at the core of the Situationist International project, fully sharing the revolutionary intentions with Debord.

==Reception==

===Criticism===
Critics of the Situationists frequently assert that their ideas are not in fact complex and difficult to understand, but are at best simple ideas expressed in deliberately difficult language, and at worst actually nonsensical. For example, anarchist Chaz Bufe asserts in Listen Anarchist! that &quot;obscure situationist jargon&quot; is a major problem in the anarchist movement. Andrea Gibbons argues that the Parisian situationists failed to take on board practically or theoretically the experience of their African members, such as is shown by Abdelhafid Khattib&#x27;s experience of police harassment while conducting psychogeographic research on Les Halles in 1958. She remarks how little the suppression of Algerians in Paris had impacted their activity and thinking – Bernstein and Debord co-signed the &quot;Declaration on the Right to Insubordination in the Algerian War&quot; in 1961, which led to them being questioned by the police. She cites a letter written by Jacqueline de Jong, Jorgen Nash, and Ansgar Elde protesting the expulsion of the &quot;Spur&quot; group in 1962 which highlights the political repression in Paris at that time. Gibbons also criticises the lack of mention of the Algerian situationists in either Debord&#x27;s or Vaneigem&#x27;s memoirs.

===Influence===
Debord&#x27;s analysis of the spectacle has been influential among people working on television, particularly in France and Italy; in Italy, TV programs produced by situationist intellectuals, like Antonio Ricci&#x27;s &quot;Striscia la notizia&quot;, or Carlo Freccero&#x27;s programming schedule for &quot;Italia 1&quot; in the early 1990s.

In the 1960s and 1970s, anarchists, communists, and other leftists offered various interpretations of Situationist concepts in combination with a variety of other perspectives. Examples of these groups include: in Amsterdam, the Provos; in the UK, King Mob, the producers of &quot;Heatwave&quot; magazine (including Charles Radcliffe who later briefly joined the English Section of the Situationist International), and the Angry Brigade. In the US, groups like Black Mask (later Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers), The Weathermen, and the Rebel Worker group also explicitly employed their ideas.

Anarchist theorists such as Fredy Perlman, Bob Black, Hakim Bey, and John Zerzan, have developed the SI&#x27;s ideas in various directions away from Marxism. These theorists were predominantly associated with the magazines &quot;Fifth Estate&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Green Anarchy&quot;. During the early 1980s, English anarchist Larry Law produced the &quot;Spectacular Times&quot; pocket-books series, which aimed to make Situationist ideas more easily assimilated into the anarchist movement. Later anarchist theorists such as the CrimethInc. collective also claim Situationist influence.

Situationist urban theory, defined initially by the members of the Lettrist International as &quot;Unitary Urbanism,&quot; was extensively developed through the behavioural and performance structures of The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture during the 1990s. The re-emergence of the London Psychogeographical Association also inspired many new psychogeographical groups including Manchester Area Psychogeographic. The LPA and the Neoist Alliance along with the Luther Blissett Project came together to form a New Lettrist International with a specifically Communist perspective. Around this time, Unpopular Books and the LPA released some key texts including new translations of Asger Jorn&#x27;s work.

Around this time also, groups such as Reclaim the Streets and Adbusters have, respectively, seen themselves as &quot;creating situations&quot; or practicing detournement on advertisements.

==Punk and culture==
In cultural terms, Situationist International&#x27;s influence has arguably been greater, if more diffuse. In the late 1960s, MC5, the Fugs and Hawkwind were radical situationist bands.

Situationist ideas exerted a strong influence on the design language of the punk rock phenomenon of the 1970s and the post-punk scene of the early 1980s. To a significant extent, this was the result of the adoption of the style, aesthetics and slogans employed by the SI. These were often secondhand influences received through British situationist groups such as King Mob whose associates included Malcolm McLaren and Jamie Reid. Factory Records owner Tony Wilson was influenced by situationist urbanism, and Factory band the Durutti Column took their name from André Bertrand&#x27;s collage &quot;Le Retour de la Colonne Durutti&quot;. (Bertrand, in turn, took his title from the eponymous anarchist army during the Spanish Civil War). American punk group the Feederz have been acclaimed as exhibiting a more direct and conscious influence. Formed in the late 1970s, they became known for extensive use of detournement and their intention to provoke their audience through the exposition of situationist themes. Other musical artists whose lyrics and artwork have referenced situationist concepts include the Clash, Pussy Riot, Crass, Tom Robinson Band, Ian Dury, X-Ray Spex, Sham 69, Buzzcocks, the Fall, Patrik Fitzgerald, Conflict, the Royal Family and the Poor, Angelic Upstarts, Chaos UK, Chaotic Dischord, MDC, Dead Kennedys, Reagan Youth, Chumbawamba and Manic Street Preachers. Situationist theory experienced a vogue in the late &#x27;90s hardcore punk scene, when it was referenced by Orchid, His Hero Is Gone and CrimethInc.

Situationist ideas may be found within the development of other avant-garde threads such as unilalianism and neoism, as well as artists such as Mark Divo.

Writers such as Thomas de Zengotita have echoed situationist theories regarding the of contemporary society.

<text>Einkorn wheat (from German &quot;Einkorn&quot;, literally &quot;single grain&quot;) is either a wild species of wheat (&quot;Triticum&quot;) or its domesticated form. The wild form is T. boeoticum (syn. &quot;T. m.&quot; subsp. &quot;boeoticum&quot;), and the domesticated form is T. monococcum (syn. &quot;T. m.&quot; subsp. &quot;monococcum&quot;). Einkorn is a diploid species (2&quot;n&quot; = 14 chromosomes) of hulled wheat, with tough glumes (husks) that tightly enclose the grains. The cultivated form is similar to the wild, except that the ear stays intact when ripe and the seeds are larger. The domestic form is known as in French, in German, &quot;einkorn&quot; or &quot;littlespelt&quot; in English, in Italian and in Spanish. The name refers to the fact that each spikelet contains only one grain.

Einkorn wheat was one of the first plants to be domesticated and cultivated. The earliest clear evidence of the domestication of einkorn dates from 10,600 to 9,900 years before present (8650 BCE to 7950 BCE) from Çayönü and Cafer Höyük, two Early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B archaeological sites in southern Turkey. Remnants of einkorn were found with the iceman mummy Ötzi, dated the late 4th millennium BCE.

== Description ==

Einkorn is a short variety of wild wheat, usually less than tall and is not very productive of edible seeds. The principal difference between wild einkorn and cultivated einkorn is the method of seed dispersal. In the wild variety the seed head usually shatters and drops the kernels (seeds) of wheat onto the ground. This facilitates a new crop of wheat. In the domestic variety, the seed head remains intact. While such a mutation may occasionally occur in the wild, it is not viable there in the long term: the intact seed head will only drop to the ground when the stalk rots, and the kernels will not scatter but form a tight clump which inhibits germination and makes the mutant seedlings susceptible to disease. But harvesting einkorn with intact seed heads was easier for early human harvesters, who could then manually break apart the seed heads and scatter any kernels not eaten. Over time and through selection, conscious or unconscious, the human preference for intact seed heads created the domestic variety, which has slightly larger kernels than wild einkorn. Domesticated einkorn thus requires human planting and harvesting for its continuing existence. This process of domestication may have taken only 20 to 200 years, resulting in a wheat that was easier to harvest.

An important characteristic facilitating the domestication of einkorn and other annual grains is that the plants are largely self-pollinating. Thus, the desirable (for human management) traits of einkorn could be perpetuated at less risk of cross-fertilization with wild plants which might have traits – e.g. smaller seeds, shattering seed heads, as less desirable for human management.

== Ecology and distribution ==

Einkorn wheat commonly grows wild in the hill country in the northern part of the Fertile Crescent and Anatolia, although it has a wider distribution reaching into the Balkans and south to Jordan near the Dead Sea. 

== History ==

=== Early human use ===

Einkorn wheat is one of the earliest cultivated forms of wheat, alongside emmer wheat (&quot;T. dicoccum&quot;). Hunter gatherers in the Fertile Crescent may have started harvesting einkorn as early as 30,000 years ago, according to archaeological evidence from Syria. 

=== Domestication ===

Although gathered from the wild for thousands of years, einkorn wheat was first domesticated approximately 10,000 years BP in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) or B (PPNB) periods. Evidence from DNA fingerprinting suggests einkorn was first domesticated near Karaca Dağ in southeast Turkey, an area in which a number of PPNB farming villages have been found. One theory by Yuval Noah Harari suggests that the domestication of einkorn was linked to intensive agriculture to support the nearby Göbekli Tepe site.

=== Spread of cultivation ===

From the northern part of the Fertile Crescent, the cultivation of einkorn wheat spread to the Caucasus, the Balkans, and central Europe. Einkorn wheat was more commonly grown in cooler climates than emmer wheat, the other domesticated wheat. Cultivation of einkorn in the Middle East began to decline in favor of emmer wheat around 2000 BC. Cultivation of einkorn was never extensive in Italy, southern France, and Spain. Einkorn continued to be cultivated in some areas of northern Europe throughout the Middle Ages and until the early part of the 20th century.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==

Cultivated Einkorn was described as a taxon, &quot;Triticum monococcum&quot;, by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Later descriptions by other taxonomists, now treated as synonyms, include &quot;Triticum pubescens&quot; by von Bieberstein in 1800; &quot;Triticum hornemanii&quot; by Clementi in 1818; &quot;Nivieria monococcum&quot; in 1841; &quot;Triticum vulgare monococcum&quot; by Alefeld in 1866; &quot;Triticum monococcum subsp. cereale&quot; by Albert Thellung in 1918. Wild Einkorn is known either as &quot;Triticum monococcum&quot; subsp. &quot;aegilopoides&quot; or as &quot;Triticum boeoticum&quot;.

Wild and domesticated einkorns are diploid wheats. Unlike emmer and bread wheat, which were formed by hybridisation with &quot;Aegilops&quot; goatgrasses, einkorn is not a hybrid.

== Agronomy ==

Einkorn wheat is low-yielding but can survive on poor, dry, marginal soils where other varieties of wheat will not. It is primarily eaten boiled in whole grains or in porridge. As with other ancient varieties of wheat such as emmer, Einkorn is a &quot;covered wheat&quot; as its kernels do not break free from its seed coat (glume) with threshing. This makes it difficult to separate the husk from the seed.

== Food use and nutrition ==

Einkorn is a common food in northern Provence (France). It is used for bulgur or as animal feed in mountainous areas of countries including France, India, Italy, Morocco, the former Yugoslavia, and Turkey. It contains gluten (so is not suitable for people with gluten-related disorders) and has a higher percentage of protein than modern red wheats. It is considered more nutritious because it has higher levels of fat, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine, and beta-carotene.

== As a resource for plant breeding ==

Einkorn is the source of many potential introgressions for immunity – Nikolai Vavilov called it an &quot;accumulator of complex immunities.&quot; &quot;T. monococcum&quot; is the source of &quot;Sr21&quot;, a stem rust resistance gene which has been introgressed into hexaploid worldwide. It is also the source of &quot;Yr34&quot;, a resistance gene for yellow rust.

The salt-tolerance feature of &quot;T. monococcum&quot; has been bred into durum wheat.

<text>In continuum mechanics, the Péclet number (, after Jean Claude Eugène Péclet) is a class of dimensionless numbers relevant in the study of transport phenomena in a continuum. It is defined to be the ratio of the rate of advection of a physical quantity by the flow to the rate of diffusion of the same quantity driven by an appropriate gradient. In the context of species or mass transfer, the Péclet number is the product of the Reynolds number and the Schmidt number (). In the context of the thermal fluids, the thermal Péclet number is equivalent to the product of the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number ().
The Péclet number is defined as
: formula_1
For mass transfer, it is defined as
: formula_2

Such ratio can also be re-written in terms of times, as a ratio between the characteristic temporal intervals of the system:
: formula_3

For formula_4 the diffusion happens in a much longer time compared to the advection, and therefore the latter of the two phenomena predominates in the mass transport. 
For heat transfer, the Péclet number is defined as
: formula_5
where is the characteristic length, the local flow velocity, the mass diffusion coefficient, the Reynolds number, the Schmidt number, the Prandtl number, and the thermal diffusivity,
: formula_6
where is the thermal conductivity, the density, and the specific heat capacity.

In engineering applications the Péclet number is often very large. In such situations, the dependency of the flow upon &quot;downstream&quot; locations is diminished, and variables in the flow tend to become &quot;one-way&quot; properties. Thus, when modelling certain situations with high Péclet numbers, simpler computational models can be adopted.

A flow will often have different Péclet numbers for heat and mass. This can lead to the phenomenon of double diffusive convection.

In the context of particulate motion the Péclet number has also been called Brenner number, with symbol , in honour of Howard Brenner.

The Péclet number also finds applications beyond transport phenomena, as a general measure for the relative importance of the random fluctuations and of the systematic average behavior in mesoscopic systems.

<text>Jean Claude Eugène Péclet (10 February 1793 – 6 December 1857) was a French physicist.

He was born in Besançon, France.

Péclet became, in 1812, one of the first students of the École Normale in Paris with Gay-Lussac and Dulong being his professors. In 1816, he was elected professor at the Collège de Marseille and taught physical sciences there until 1827. Being nominated &quot;maître de conférences&quot; (tenured position) at the École Normale Supérieure, he returned to Paris. In 1829, he became a professor of physics at the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures that was being founded by the businessman Alphonse Lavallée, by Péclet, and by two other scientists, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Théodore Olivier. 
His salary was then 3000 Francs per year, plus a share of the profits of this private engineering school. 
In 1840, Péclet became inspecteur général de l&#x27;instruction publique.

The Péclet number is named after him. He was Coriolis&#x27;s brother-in-law.

He died in Paris.

<text>The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), founded in 1804 as the Horticultural Society of London, is the UK&#x27;s leading gardening charity.

The RHS promotes horticulture through its five gardens at Wisley (Surrey), Hyde Hall (Essex), Harlow Carr (North Yorkshire), Rosemoor (Devon) and Bridgewater (Greater Manchester); flower shows including the Chelsea Flower Show, Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, Tatton Park Flower Show and Cardiff Flower Show; community gardening schemes; Britain in Bloom and a vast educational programme. It also supports training for professional and amateur gardeners. the president was Keith Weed and the director general was Clare Matterson CBE.

== History ==

=== Founders ===

The creation of a British horticultural society was suggested by John Wedgwood (son of Josiah Wedgwood) in 1800. His aims were fairly modest: he wanted to hold regular meetings, allowing the society&#x27;s members the opportunity to present papers on their horticultural activities and discoveries, to encourage discussion of them, and to publish the results. The society would also award prizes for gardening achievements.

Wedgwood discussed the idea with his friends, but it was four years before the first meeting, of seven men, took place, on 7 March 1804 at Hatchards bookshop in Piccadilly, London. Wedgwood was chairman; also present were William Townsend Aiton (successor to his father, William Aiton, as Superintendent of Kew Gardens), Sir Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society), James Dickson (a nurseryman), William Forsyth (Superintendent of the gardens of St. James&#x27;s Palace and Kensington Palace), Charles Francis Greville (a Lord of the Admiralty) and Richard Anthony Salisbury, who became the Secretary of the new society.

Banks proposed his friend Thomas Andrew Knight for membership. The proposal was accepted, despite Knight&#x27;s ongoing feud with Forsyth over a plaster for healing tree wounds which Forsyth was developing. Knight was president of the society from 1811 to 1838, and developed the society&#x27;s aims and objectives to include a programme of practical research into fruit-breeding.

==Membership==

In 2009 more than 363,000 people were members of the society, and the number increased to more than 414,000 in 2013 and to 525,105 by 2019. Membership and fellowship of the society were previously decided by election, but are now by financial contribution. Fellows are supporters &quot;contributing a suggested £5,000 per annum&quot; (as of 2022).

Members and Fellows of the Royal Horticultural Society are entitled to use the post-nominal letters MRHS and FRHS, respectively.
== Gardens ==
The Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s five major gardens in England are: Wisley Garden, near Wisley in Surrey; Rosemoor Garden in Devon; Hyde Hall in Essex; Harlow Carr in Harrogate, North Yorkshire and RHS Garden, Bridgewater in Worsley, Greater Manchester.

The society&#x27;s first garden was in Kensington, from 1818 to 1822. In 1820 the society leased some of Hugh Ronalds&#x27; nursery ground at Little Ealing to set up an experimental garden, but the next year part of the Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s estate at Chiswick was obtained. In 1823 it employed Joseph Paxton there. From 1827 the society held fêtes at the Chiswick garden, and from 1833, shows with competitive classes for flowers and vegetables. In 1861 the RHS (as it had now become) developed a new garden at South Kensington on land leased from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 (the Science Museum, Imperial College and the Royal College of Music now occupy the site), but it was closed in 1882. The Chiswick garden was maintained until 1903–1904, by which time Sir Thomas Hanbury had bought the garden at Wisley and presented it to the RHS.

RHS Garden Wisley is thus the society&#x27;s oldest garden. Rosemoor came next, presented by Lady Anne Berry in 1988. Hyde Hall was given to the RHS in 1993 by its owners Dick and Helen Robinson. Dick Robinson was also the owner of the Harry Smith Collection which was based at Hyde Hall. Then came Harlow Carr, acquired by the merger of the Northern Horticultural Society with the RHS in 2001. It had been the Northern Horticultural Society&#x27;s trial ground and display garden since they bought it in 1949. In 2013, more than 1.63 million people visited the four gardens.

In 2015 the RHS announced plans for a fifth garden at Worsley New Hall, Greater Manchester, under the name RHS Garden Bridgewater. The garden opened in May 2021.

== Shows ==
The RHS is well known for its annual flower shows which take place across the UK. The most famous of these shows is the RHS Chelsea Flower Show, visited by people from across the world. This was followed by the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show (which the RHS took over in 1993) and RHS Tatton Park Flower Show in Cheshire (since 1999). In 2024 the line up expanded to include the Malvern Spring Festival, Garden Hyde Hall Flower Show, Garden Rosemoor Flower Show and the first RHS Urban Show 

The society is also closely involved with BBC Gardeners&#x27; World Live held annually at the Birmingham National Exhibition Centre.

== Libraries ==
The RHS is custodian of the Lindley Library, housed within its headquarters at 80 Vincent Square, London, and in branches at each of its four gardens. The library is based upon the book collection of John Lindley.

The RHS Herbarium has its own image library (collection) consisting of more than 3,300 original watercolours, approximately 30,000 colour slides and a rapidly increasing number of digital images. Although most of the images have been supplied by photographers commissioned by the RHS, the archive includes a substantial number of slides from the Harry Smith Collection and Plant Heritage National Plant Collection holders.

The libraries in each of the gardens are open to all visitors. RHS members can borrow books from the Lindley London, as well as the libraries at Wisley Garden and Harlow Carr Garden.

== Britain in Bloom ==

In 2002, the RHS took over the administration of the Britain in Bloom competition from the Tidy Britain Group (formerly and subsequently Keep Britain Tidy). In 2010, the society launched &#x27;It&#x27;s your neighbourhood&#x27;, a campaign to encourage people to get involved in horticulture for the benefit of their community. In 2014, &#x27;Britain in Bloom&#x27; celebrated its 50th anniversary.

==Education and training==

The RHS runs formal courses for professional and amateur gardeners and horticulturalists and also validates qualifications gained elsewhere (e.g. at Kew Botanic Gardens).

The RHS Level 1 Award in Practical Horticulture aims to develop essential horticultural skills and to provide a foundation for further RHS practical qualifications at Levels 2 and 3. It is aimed at anyone who has an interest in plants and gardening.

Level 2 qualifications provide a basis for entry into professional horticulture, support career development for existing horticultural workers or can provide a foundation for further learning or training. There are separate theoretical- and practical-based qualifications at this Level and the RHS Level 2 Diploma in the Principles and Practices of Horticulture combines the theoretical- and practical-based qualifications.

Level 3 qualifications allow specialisation in the candidate&#x27;s area of interest. They can offer proficiency for those looking for employment in horticulture, they can support further career and professional development for those already working in the field, or they can provide a basis for continued learning or training. As for Level 2, there are theoretical- and practical-based qualifications at Level 3 and a Diploma that combines both.

The Master of Horticulture (RHS) Award is the society&#x27;s most prestigious professional horticultural qualification. It is of degree level and it is intended for horticultural professionals. The course allows for flexible study over a period of three years or more.

The RHS Campaign for School Gardening provides online inspiration, resources and advice to its members. With the help of teachers, volunteers and other school-gardening champions, they support millions of students in the UK, giving them the opportunity to grow plants, food and develop life skills.

== Medals and awards ==

===People===
The society honours certain British persons who are deemed by its council to be deserving of special recognition in the field of horticulture with the Victoria Medal of Honour, established in 1897. There are only 63 holders of this medal at any time, one for every year of the reign of Queen Victoria. Since 2023, the society has handed out the Elizabeth Medal of Honour, for which there could be only 70 holders at any time, one for every year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Thus, neither of the aforementioned medals are awarded every year

Other awards bestowed by the society include the Associate of Honour (established in 1930) where the number does not exceed 100 at any time (unless they also hold the Victoria Medal of Honour). As of 2022 there were also the Harlow Carr Medal (for significant contribution to horticulture in the north of England), Reginald Cory Memorial Cup (for introducing new hybrid plants developed from existing garden plants), Community Award (for long-term contribution to community gardening) and the Roy Lancaster Award (for exceptional contribution by those under 35 years old). Medals issued by the society earlier in its history have included the Banksian, Knightian and Lindley medals, named after early officers of the society, as well as Honorary Fellowships.

The Veitch Memorial Medal, named after James Veitch, is awarded annually to persons of any nationality who have made an outstanding contribution to the advancement and improvement of the science and practice of horticulture.

The society awards Gold, Silver-gilt, Silver and Bronze medals to exhibitors at its Flower Shows.

===Plants===
The Award of Garden Merit, or AGM, is the principal award made to garden plants by the society after a period of assessment by the appropriate committees of the society. Awards are made annually after plant trials.

Older books may contain references to the following awards, which were based mainly on flower or fruit quality (but which are not referred to in current (2014) RHS websites and reports):
: PC: Preliminary Certificate
: HC: Highly Commended
: AM: Award of Merit (not the same as the AGM)
: FCC: First Class Certificate (once a very prestigious award)

== Publications ==

=== Journals ===
The society published its proceedings as the &quot;Transactions of the Horticultural Society of London&quot; from 1807 to 1848. The society has also published a journal since 1846. Initially known as the &quot;Journal of the Horticultural Society of London&quot; (1846–1855), then &quot;Proceedings of the Horticultural Society of London&quot; (1859–1860) and &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Horticultural Society&quot; (1861–1869). This was continued as &quot;Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society&quot; (1866–1975).

Since 1975 it has been entitled &quot;The Garden&quot; as a monthly publication. The RHS also publishes both &quot;The Plant Review&quot; and &quot;The Orchid Review&quot; four times a year, and &quot;Hanburyana&quot;, an annual publication dedicated to horticultural taxonomy since 2006.

===Registers and encyclopedias===
Since the establishment of International Registration Authorities for plants in 1955 the RHS has acted as Registrar for certain groups of cultivated plants. It is now Registrar for nine categories – conifers, clematis, daffodils, dahlias, delphiniums, dianthus, lilies, orchids and rhododendrons. It publishes The International Orchid Register, an extensive listing of orchid hybrids, and the &quot;Encyclopedia of Conifers&quot;, which was published in 2012.

<text>Tashkent (), also known as Toshkent, is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan. It is the most populous city in Central Asia, with a population of more than 3 million people as of April 1, 2024. It is located in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with Kazakhstan.

Before the influence of Islam in the mid-8th century AD, Sogdian and Turkic culture was predominant. After Genghis Khan destroyed the city in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from its location on the Silk Road. From the 18th to the 19th centuries, the city became an independent city-state, before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian Empire; as a result, it became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, but it was soon rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after Moscow, Leningrad and Kyiv.

Today, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multiethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, it celebrated 2,200 years of its written history. The master plan of Tashkent until 2045 was approved.

==History==
===Etymology===
During its long history, Tashkent has undergone various changes in names and political and religious affiliations. Abu Rayhan Biruni wrote that the city&#x27;s name Tashkent comes from the turkic &quot;tash&quot; and persian &quot;kent&quot;, literally translated as &quot;Stone City&quot; or &quot;City of Stones&quot;.

Ilya Gershevitch (1974:55, 72) (apud Livshits, 2007:179) traces the city&#x27;s old name Chach back to Old Iranian *&quot;čāiča-&quot; &quot;area of water, lake&quot; (cf. &quot;Čaēčista&quot;, the Aral Sea&#x27;s name in the Avesta) (whence Middle Chinese transcription *&quot;źiäk&quot; &gt; standard Chinese &quot;Shí&quot; with Chinese character 石 for &quot;stone&quot;), and *&quot;Čačkand&quot; ~ &quot;Čačkanθ&quot; was the basis for Turkic adaptation Tashkent, popularly etymologized as &quot;stone city&quot;. Livshits proposes that &quot;Čač&quot; originally designated only the Aral Sea before being used for the Tashkent oasis.

Ünal (2022) critiques Gershevitch&#x27;s and Livshits&#x27;s etymology as being &quot;based on too many assumptions&quot;. He instead derives the name &quot;Čač&quot; from Late Proto-Turkic *&quot;t1iāt2(ă)&quot; &quot;stone&quot;, which he proposes to be seemingly another translation, besides the apparent Chinese translation 石 &quot;shí&quot; &quot;stone&quot;, of *&quot;kaŋk-&quot; (whence Chinese transcription 康居 EHC *&quot;kʰɑŋ-kɨɑ&quot; &gt; standard Chinese &quot;Kāngjū&quot;), which possibly meant &quot;stone&quot;. Against Harold Walter Bailey&#x27;s and Edwin G. Pulleyblank&#x27;s suggested Tocharian origin for *&quot;kaŋk-&quot;, Ünal proposes that it was instead an Iranian word and compares it to Pashto &quot;kā́ṇay&quot; &quot;stone&quot;.

===Early history===
Tashkent was first settled between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC as an oasis on the Chirchik River, near the foothills of the West Tian Shan Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer &quot;capital&quot; of the Kangju confederacy. Some scholars believe that a &quot;Stone Tower&quot; mentioned by Ptolemy in his famous treatise &quot;Geography&quot;, and by other early accounts of travel on the old Silk Road, referred to this settlement (due to its etymology). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.

===History as Chach===

In pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as &quot;Chach&quot;. The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.
The principality of Chach had a square citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some south of the Syr Darya River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the Sogdians and Turkic nomads. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang (602/603? – 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as (). The Chinese chronicles &quot;History of Northern Dynasties&quot;, &quot;Book of Sui&quot;, and &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; mention a possession called (&quot;stone&quot;) or with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.

In 558–603, Chach was part of the Turkic Khaganate. At the beginning of the 7th century, the Turkic Kaganate, as a result of internecine wars and wars with its neighbors, disintegrated into the Western and Eastern Khaganates. The Western Turkic ruler Tong Yabghu Qaghan (618-630) set up his headquarters in the Ming-bulak area to the north of Chach. Here he received embassies from the emperors of the Tang Empire and Byzantium. In 626, the Indian Buddhist preacher Prabhakāramitra arrived with ten companions to the Khagan. In 628, Xuanzang arrived in Ming-bulak.

The Turkic rulers of Chach minted their coins with the inscription on the obverse side of the &quot;lord of the Khakan money&quot; (mid-8th century); with an inscription in the ruler Turk (7th century), in Nudjket in the middle of the 8th century, coins were issued with the obverse inscription “Nanchu (Banchu) Ertegin sovereign&quot;.

===Islamic Caliphate===

Chach (Arabic: Shash) was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate at the beginning of the 8th century.

According to the descriptions of the authors of the 10th century, Shash was structurally divided into a citadel, an inner city (madina) and two suburbs - an inner (rabad-dahil) and an outer (rabad-harij). The citadel, surrounded by a special wall with two gates, contained the ruler&#x27;s palace and the prison.
===Post Caliphate rule===

Under the Samanid Empire, whose founder Ismail Samani was a descendant of Persian Zoroastrian convert to Islam, the city came to be known as &quot;Binkath&quot;. However, the Arabs retained the old name of &quot;Chach&quot; for the surrounding region, pronouncing it &quot;ash-Shāsh&quot; () instead. 
Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali ash-Shashi, known as al-Kaffal ash-Shashi (904-975), was born in Tashkent. He was an Islamic theologian, scholar, jurist of the Shafi&#x27;i &quot;madhhab&quot;, hadith scholar and linguist.

After the 11th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of &quot;Tashkent&quot; reflects Russian orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.

At the end of the 10th century, Tashkent became part of the possessions of the Turkic state of the Karakhanids. In 998/99 the Tashkent oasis went to the Karakhanid Ahmad ibn Ali, who ruled the north-eastern regions of Mavarannahr. In 1177/78, a separate khanate was formed in the Tashkent oasis. Its center was Banakat, where dirhams of Mu&#x27;izz ad-dunya wa-d-din Qilich-khan were minted, in 1195–1197; and of Jalal ad-dunya wa-d-din Tafgach-khakan, in 1197–1206.

===Mongol conquest===

The city was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols&#x27; destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire in 1220.

===Timurid period===

Under the Timurid and subsequent Shaybanid dynasties, the city&#x27;s population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the Silk Road.
During the reign of Amir Timur (1336-1405), Tashkent was restored and in the 14th-15th centuries Tashkent was part of Timur&#x27;s empire. For Timur, Tashkent was considered a strategic city. In 1391 Timur set out in the spring from Tashkent to Desht-i-Kipchak to fight the Khan of the Golden Horde Tokhtamysh Khan. Timur returned from this victorious campaign through Tashkent.

The most famous saint Sufi of Tashkent was Sheikh Khovendi at-Takhur (13th to the first half of the 14th century). According to legend, Amir Timur, who was treating his wounded leg in Tashkent with the healing water of the Zem-Zem spring, ordered to build a mausoleum for the saint. By order of Timur, the Zangiata mausoleum was built.

===Uzbek Shaybanid&#x27;s dynasty period===
In the 16th century, Tashkent was ruled by the Shaybanid dynasty.

Shaybanid Suyunchkhoja Khan was an enlightened Uzbek ruler; following the traditions of his ancestors Mirzo Ulugbek and Abul Khair Khan, he gathered famous scientists, writers and poets at his court, among them: Vasifi, Abdullah Nasrullahi, Masud bin Osmani Kuhistani. Since 1518 Vasifi was the educator of the son of Suyunchhoja Khan Keldi Muhammad, with whom, after the death of his father in 1525, he moved to Tashkent. After the death of his former pupil, he became the educator of his son, Abu-l-Muzaffar Hasan-Sultan.

Later the city was subordinated to Shaybanid Abdullah Khan II (the ruler actually from 1557, officially in 1583–1598), who issued his coins here.
From 1598 to 1604 Tashkent was ruled by the Shaybanid Keldi Muhammad, who issued silver and copper coins on his behalf.

===Kazakh ruled period===
In 1598, Kazakh Tauekel Khan was at war with the Khanate of Bukhara. The Bukhara troops sent against him were defeated by Kazakhs in the battle between Tashkent and Samarkand. During the reign of Yesim-Khan, a peace treaty was concluded between Bukhara and Kazakhs, according to which Kazakhs abandoned Samarkand, but left behind Tashkent, Turkestan and a number of Syr Darya cities.

Yesim-Khan ruled the Kazakh Khanate from 1598 to 1628, his main merit was that he managed to unite the Kazakh khanate.

The city was part of Kazakh Khanate between 1598 and 1723.

===Tashkent state===
In 1784, Yunus Khoja, the ruler of the dakha (district) Shayhantahur, united the entire city under his rule and created an independent Tashkent state (1784-1807), which by the beginning of the 19th century seized vast lands.

===Kokand Khanate===
In 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the Khanate of Kokand. At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia.

Under the Kokand domination, Tashkent was surrounded by a moat and an adobe battlement (about 20 kilometers long) with 12 gates.

It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand&#x27;s high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of Bukhara over that of Kokand. However, before the Emir of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.

===Colonial period===
In May 1865, Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the Tsar and outnumbered at least 15–1, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a Russian Orthodox priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including Alimqul, the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev, dubbed the &quot;Lion of Tashkent&quot; by city elders, staged a hearts-and-minds campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself &quot;Military Governor of Tashkent&quot;, recommending to Tsar Alexander II that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.

The Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a loose cannon, and soon replaced him with General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of Russian Turkistan, with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A cantonment and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the Great Game rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The Turkestan Military District was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The Trans-Caspian Railway arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of Bolshevik Revolution.

===Effect of the Russian Revolution===

With the fall of the Russian Empire, the Russian Provisional Government removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the February Revolution. The Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers&#x27; and Workers&#x27; Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (&quot;Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya&quot;) based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General Aleksey Kuropatkin closed the events with words &quot;Long Live a great free Russia&quot;.

The First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16–20 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the Jadid, Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the Ulema. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.

In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR). The new regime was threatened by White forces, &quot;basmachi;&quot; revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow.

===Soviet period===
The city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.

Violating the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.

It also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent. The Russian population increased dramatically; evacuees from the war zones increased the total population of Tashkent to well over a million. Russians and Ukrainians eventually comprised more than half of the total residents of Tashkent. Many of the former refugees stayed in Tashkent to live after the war, rather than return to former homes.

During the postwar period, the Soviet Union established numerous scientific and engineering facilities in Tashkent.

On 10 January 1966, then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan President Ayub Khan signed a pact in Tashkent with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin as the mediator to resolve the terms of peace after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.

Much of Tashkent&#x27;s old city was destroyed by a powerful earthquake on 26 April 1966. More than 300,000 residents were left homeless, and some 78,000 poorly engineered homes were destroyed, mainly in the densely populated areas of the old city where traditional adobe housing predominated. The Soviet republics, and some other countries, such as Finland, sent &quot;battalions of fraternal peoples&quot; and urban planners to help rebuild devastated Tashkent.

Tashkent was rebuilt as a model Soviet city with wide streets planted with shade trees, parks, immense plazas for parades, fountains, monuments, and acres of apartment blocks. The Tashkent Metro was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970, but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent. Further development in the following years increased the size of the city with major new developments in the Chilonzor area, north-east and south-east of the city.

At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth-largest city in the USSR and a center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.

Due to the 1966 earthquake and the Soviet redevelopment, little architectural heritage has survived of Tashkent&#x27;s ancient history. Few structures mark its significance as a trading point on the historic Silk Road.

Such countries of the Soviet Union as Azerbaijan and Armenia, Kazakhstan and Georgia, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, Latvia, Moldova, Estonia helped restore the city after the earthquake and erected many modern buildings.

===Capital of Uzbekistan===
Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan, noted for its tree-lined streets, fountains and parks. In 2009, the local government initiated a controversial tree-cutting campaign.
Since 1991, the city has changed economically, culturally, and architecturally. New development has superseded or replaced icons of the Soviet era. The largest statue ever erected for Lenin was replaced with a globe, featuring a geographic map of Uzbekistan. Buildings from the Soviet era have been replaced with new modern buildings. The &quot;Downtown Tashkent&quot; district includes the 22-story NBU Bank building, international hotels, the International Business Center, and the Plaza Building.
The Tashkent Business district is a special district, established for the development of small, medium and large businesses in Uzbekistan. In 2018, construction began on a new Downtown which would include a business district with skyscrapers of local and foreign companies, world hotels such as Hilton Tashkent Hotel, apartments, malls, shops and other entertainment. The construction of the International Business Center is planned to be completed by the end of 2021. Fitch assigns “BB−” rating to Tashkent city, “Stable” forecast.

In 2007, Tashkent was named a &quot;cultural capital of the Islamic world&quot; by &quot;Moscow News&quot;, as the city has numerous historic mosques and significant Islamic sites, including the Islamic University. Tashkent holds the Samarkand Kufic Quran, one of the earliest written copies of the Quran, which has been located in the city since 1924.

Tashkent is the most visited city in the country, and has greatly benefited from increasing tourism as a result of reforms under president Shavkat Mirziyoyev and opening up by abolishing visas for visitors from the European Union and other developing countries or making visas easier for foreigners.

===Tashkent over the years===
===The invention of television===
In the summer of 1928, the first fully electronic TV set was presented to the public in Tashkent. Boris Grabovsky&#x27;s method, patented in Saratov in 1925, proposed a new model of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (Борис Голендер in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event. This date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth as inventors of the first fully electronic TV set. In 1964, the contribution made to the development of early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree &quot;Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;.

==Geography==
Tashkent is situated in a well-watered plain on the road between Samarkand, Uzbekistan&#x27;s second city, and Shymkent across the border. Tashkent is just 13 km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan.

Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), Kashgar (China), Almaty (Kazakhstan), Kabul (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan).

Tashkent sits at the confluence of the Chirchiq River and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to . The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes.

The local time in Tashkent is UTC/GMT +5 hours.

==Climate==
Tashkent features a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with some humid continental climate influences (Köppen: &quot;Dsa&quot;). As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Most precipitation occurs during the winter, which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.

==Demographics==

In 1983, the population of Tashkent amounted to 1,902,000 people living in a municipal area of . By 1991, the year the Soviet Union dissolved, the city&#x27;s population had grown to approximately 2,136,600. Tashkent was the fourth most populated city in the former USSR, after Moscow, Leningrad (St. Petersburg), and Kyiv. Nowadays, Tashkent remains the fourth most populous city in the CIS.

As of 2020, the city&#x27;s population was 2,716,176.
*78.0% – Uzbeks 
*5% – Russians
*4.5% – Tatars
*2.2% – Koryo-saram (Koreans) 
*2.1% – Tajiks
*1.2% – Uighurs
*7.0% – other ethnic backgrounds

Uzbek is the main spoken language in Tashkent, though Russian is also spoken as a lingua franca. As in much of Uzbekistan, signage in Tashkent often contains a mix of Latin and Cyrillic scripts.

==Districts==






Since 2020, when Yangihayot District was created, Tashkent has been divided into the following 12 districts ():
Before Tashkent was conquered by the Russian Empire, it was divided into four districts, or &quot;daha&quot; in Uzbek:

#Beshyoghoch
#Kukcha
#Shaykhontokhur
#Sebzor

In 1940 it had the following districts (Russian &quot;район&quot;):

#Oktyabr
#Kirov
#Stalin
#Frunze
#Lenin
#Kuybishev

By 1981, these were reorganized into the following:

#Bektemir
#Akmal-Ikramov (Uchtepa)
#Khamza (Yashnobod)
#Lenin (Mirobod)
#Kuybishev (Mirzo Ulugbek)
#Sergeli
#Oktober (Shaykhontokhur)
#Sobir Rakhimov (Olmazar)
#Chilanzar
#Frunze (Yakkasaray)
#Kirov (Yunusabad)

==Landmarks==



Due to the destruction of most of the ancient city during the 1917 revolution and, later, the 1966 earthquake, little remains of Tashkent&#x27;s traditional architectural heritage. Tashkent is, however, rich in museums and Soviet-era monuments. They include:

*Kukeldash Madrasah. Dating back to the reign of Abdullah Khan II (1557–1598) it is being restored by the provincial Religious Board of Mawarannahr Moslems. There is talk of making it into a museum, but it is currently being used as a madrassah.
*Chorsu Bazaar, located near the Kukeldash Madrassa. This huge open air bazaar is the center of the old town of Tashkent. Everything imaginable is for sale. It is one of the major tourist attractions of the city.
*Hazrati Imam Complex. It includes several mosques, shrine, and a library which contains a manuscript Qur&#x27;an in Kufic script, considered to be the oldest extant Qur&#x27;an in the world. Dating from 655 and stained with the blood of murdered caliph, Uthman, it was brought by Timur to Samarkand, seized by the Russians as a war trophy, and taken to Saint Petersburg. It was returned to Uzbekistan in 1924.
*Qaffol Shoshi mausoleum built in honor of Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Ismail al-Kaffal ash-Shashi. The original tomb did not survive in its initial form.

*The Tashkent Metro is known for extravagant design and architecture in the buildings. Taking photos in the system was banned until 2018.

The Russian Orthodox church in Amir Temur Square, built in 1898, was demolished in 2009. The building had not been allowed to be used for religious purposes since the 1920s due to the anti-religious campaign conducted across the former Soviet Union by the Bolshevik (communist) government in Moscow. During the Soviet period, the building was used for different non-religious purposes; after independence, it was a bank.

Tashkent also has a World War II memorial park and a Defender of Motherland monument.

<text>Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams, herringbone diagrams, cause-and-effect diagrams) are causal diagrams created by Kaoru Ishikawa that show the potential causes of a specific event.

Common uses of the Ishikawa diagram are product design and quality defect prevention to identify potential factors causing an overall effect. Each cause or reason for imperfection is a source of variation. Causes are usually grouped into major categories to identify and classify these sources of variation.

==Overview==

The &quot;defect&quot;, or the problem to be solved, is shown as the fish&#x27;s head, facing to the right, with the &quot;causes&quot; extending to the left as fishbones; the ribs branch off the backbone for major causes, with sub-branches for root-causes, to as many levels as required.

Ishikawa diagrams were popularized in the 1960s by Kaoru Ishikawa, who pioneered quality management processes in the Kawasaki shipyards, and in the process became one of the founding fathers of modern management.

The basic concept was first used in the 1920s, and is considered one of the seven basic tools of quality control. It is known as a fishbone diagram because of its shape, similar to the side view of a fish skeleton.

Mazda Motors famously used an Ishikawa diagram in the development of the Miata (MX5) sports car.
==Root causes==
Root-cause analysis is intended to reveal key relationships among various variables, and the possible causes provide additional insight into process behavior. It shows high-level causes that lead to the problem encountered by providing a snapshot of the current situation.

There can be confusion about the relationships between problems, causes, symptoms and effects. Smith highlights this and the common question “Is that a problem or a symptom?” which mistakenly presumes that problems and symptoms are mutually exclusive categories. A problem is a situation that bears improvement; a symptom is the effect of a cause: a situation can be both a problem and a symptom.

At a practical level, a cause is whatever is responsible for, or explains, an effect - a factor &quot;whose presence makes a critical difference to the occurrence of an outcome&quot;.

The causes emerge by analysis, often through brainstorming sessions, and are grouped into categories on the main branches off the fishbone. To help structure the approach, the categories are often selected from one of the common models shown below, but may emerge as something unique to the application in a specific case.

Each potential cause is traced back to find the root cause, often using the 5 Whys technique.

Typical categories include:

===The 5 Ms (used in manufacturing)===
Originating with lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System, the 5 Ms is one of the most common frameworks for root-cause analysis:
*Manpower / Mindpower (physical or knowledge work, includes: kaizens, suggestions)
*Machine (equipment, technology)
*Material (includes raw material, consumables, and information)
*Method (process)
*Measurement / medium (inspection, environment)
These have been expanded by some to include an additional three, and are referred to as the 8 Ms:
*Mission / mother nature (purpose, environment)
*Management / money power (leadership)
*Maintenance

===The 8 Ps (used in product marketing)===
This common model for identifying crucial attributes for planning in product marketing is often also used in root-cause analysis as categories for the Ishikawa diagram:
*Product (or service)
*Price
*Place
*Promotion
*People (personnel)
*Process
*Physical evidence (proof)
*Performance

===The 4 or 5 Ss (used in service industries)===
An alternative used for service industries, uses four categories of possible cause: 
*Surroundings
*Suppliers
*Systems
*Skill
*Safety

<doc id="57538" wikidata="Q36749" url="?curid=57538" title="Beer Hall Putsch">
<text>The Beer Hall Putsch, also known as the Munich Putsch, was a failed coup d&#x27;état by Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler, Erich Ludendorff and other leaders in Munich, Bavaria, on , during the period of the Weimar Republic. Approximately two thousand Nazis marched on the , in the city centre, but were confronted by a police cordon, which resulted in the deaths of 15 Nazis, four police officers, and one bystander.

Hitler escaped immediate arrest and was spirited off to safety in the countryside. After two days, he was arrested and charged with treason.

The putsch brought Hitler to the attention of the German nation for the first time and generated front-page headlines in newspapers around the world. His arrest was followed by a 24-day trial, which was widely publicised and gave him a platform to express his nationalist sentiments. Hitler was found guilty of treason and sentenced to five years in Landsberg Prison, where he dictated to fellow prisoners Emil Maurice and Rudolf Hess. On 20 December 1924, having served only nine months, Hitler was released. Once released, Hitler redirected his focus towards obtaining power through legal means rather than by revolution or force, and accordingly changed his tactics, further developing Nazi propaganda.

== Background ==
In the early 20th century, many of the larger cities of southern Germany had beer halls, where hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of people would socialise in the evenings, drink beer and participate in political and social debates. Such beer halls also became the hosts of occasional political rallies. One of Munich&#x27;s largest beer halls was the , which became the site where the putsch began.

After the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, Germany declined as a major European power. Like many Germans of the period, Hitler, who had fought in the German Army but still held Austrian citizenship at the time, believed the treaty to be a betrayal, with the country having been &quot;stabbed in the back&quot; by its own government, particularly as the German Army was popularly thought to have been undefeated in the field. For the defeat, Hitler scapegoated civilian leaders, Jews and Marxists, later called the &quot;November Criminals&quot;.

Hitler remained in the army in Munich after the war. He participated in various &quot;national thinking&quot; courses, organised by the Education and Propaganda Department of the Bavarian Army under Captain Karl Mayr, of which Hitler became an agent. Captain Mayr ordered Hitler, then an army (not the equivalent of lance corporal, but a special class of private) and holder of the Iron Cross, First Class, to infiltrate the tiny (&quot;German Workers&#x27; Party&quot;, abbreviated DAP). Hitler joined the DAP on 12 September 1919. He soon realised that he was in agreement with many of the underlying tenets of the DAP, and rose to its top post in the ensuing chaotic political atmosphere of postwar Munich. By agreement, Hitler assumed the political leadership of a number of Bavarian revanchist &quot;patriotic associations&quot;, called the . This political base extended to include about 15,000 members of the (SA, literally &quot;Storm Detachment&quot;), the paramilitary wing of the NSDAP.

On 26 September 1923, following a period of terror and political violence, Bavarian Prime Minister declared a state of emergency, and was appointed (&quot;state commissioner&quot;), with dictatorial powers to govern the state. Along with , Bavarian state police chief Colonel and General formed a ruling triumvirate. Hitler announced that he would hold 14 mass meetings beginning on 27 September 1923. Afraid of the potential disruption, one of &#x27;s first actions was to ban the announced meetings, placing Hitler under pressure to act. The Nazis, with other leaders in the , felt they had to march upon Berlin and seize power or their followers would turn to the communists. Hitler enlisted the help of World War I general in an attempt to gain the support of and his triumvirate. However, had his own plan with and to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.

== The putsch ==
The putsch was inspired by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s successful March on Rome. From 22 to 29 October 1922, Hitler and his associates planned to use Munich as a base for a march against Germany&#x27;s Weimar Republic government, but circumstances differed from those in Italy. Hitler came to the realisation that Kahr sought to control him and was not ready to act against the government in Berlin. Hitler wanted to seize a critical moment for successful popular agitation and support. He decided to take matters into his own hands. Hitler, along with a large detachment of SA, marched on the Bürgerbräukeller, where Kahr was making a speech in front of 3,000 people.

On the evening of 8 November 1923, 603 SA surrounded the beer hall and a machine gun was set up in the auditorium. Hitler, surrounded by his associates Hermann Göring, Alfred Rosenberg, Rudolf Hess, Ernst Hanfstaengl, Ulrich Graf, Johann Aigner, Adolf Lenk, Max Amann, Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter, Wilhelm Adam, Robert Wagner and others (some 20 in all), advanced through the crowded auditorium. Unable to be heard above the crowd, Hitler fired a shot into the ceiling and jumped on a chair, yelling: &quot;The national revolution has broken out! The hall is surrounded by six hundred men. Nobody is allowed to leave.&quot; He went on to state that the Bavarian government was deposed and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff.

Hitler, accompanied by Hess, Lenk, and Graf, ordered the triumvirate of Kahr, Seisser and Lossow into an adjoining room at gunpoint and demanded they support the putsch and accept the government positions he assigned them. Hitler had promised Lossow a few days earlier that he would not attempt a coup, but now thought that he would get an immediate response of affirmation from them, imploring Kahr to accept the position of Regent of Bavaria. Kahr replied that he could not be expected to collaborate, especially as he had been taken out of the auditorium under heavy guard.

Heinz Pernet, Johann Aigne and Scheubner-Richter were dispatched to pick up Ludendorff, whose personal prestige was being harnessed to give the Nazis credibility. A telephone call was made from the kitchen by Hermann Kriebel to Ernst Röhm, who was waiting with his &quot;Bund Reichskriegsflagge&quot; in the &quot;Löwenbräukeller&quot;, another beer hall, and he was ordered to seize key buildings throughout the city. At the same time, co-conspirators under Gerhard Rossbach mobilised the students of a nearby infantry officers&#x27; school to seize other objectives.

Hitler became irritated by Kahr and summoned Ernst Pöhner, Friedrich Weber, and Hermann Kriebel to stand in for him while he returned to the auditorium flanked by Rudolf Hess and Adolf Lenk. He followed up on Göring&#x27;s speech and stated that the action was not directed at the police and Reichswehr, but against &quot;the Berlin Jew government and the November criminals of 1918&quot;. Dr. Karl Alexander von Mueller, a professor of modern history and political science at the University of Munich and a supporter of Kahr, was an eyewitness. He reported:

I cannot remember in my entire life such a change in the attitude of a crowd in a few minutes, almost a few seconds ... Hitler had turned them inside out, as one turns a glove inside out, with a few sentences. It had almost something of hocus-pocus, or magic about it.
Hitler ended his speech with: &quot;Outside are Kahr, Lossow and Seisser. They are struggling hard to reach a decision. May I say to them that you will stand behind them?&quot;

The crowd in the hall backed Hitler with a roar of approval. He finished:

You can see that what motivates us is neither self-conceit nor self-interest, but only a burning desire to join the battle in this grave eleventh hour for our German Fatherland ... One last thing I can tell you. Either the German revolution begins tonight or we will all be dead by dawn!

Hitler, Ludendorff, &quot;et al.&quot;, returned to the main hall&#x27;s podium, where they gave speeches and shook hands. The crowd was then allowed to leave the hall. In a tactical mistake, Hitler decided to leave the Bürgerbräukeller shortly thereafter to deal with a crisis elsewhere. Around 22:30, Ludendorff released Kahr and his associates.

The Bund Oberland, under the command of Max Ritter von Müller, was sent to seize weapons from the Army Engineer Barracks under the pretence of performing training manoeuvres. Oskar Cantzler, captain of the 1st company of the 7th Engineer Battalion, did not believe them, but allowed them to perform the manoeuvres inside the building. He locked the building with the 400 men inside and positioned two machine guns at the entrance. Hitler attempted to have the men released, but Cantzler refused. Hitler considered using artillery to destroy the building but chose not to.

The night was marked by confusion and unrest among government officials, armed forces, police units, and individuals deciding where their loyalties lay. Units of the &quot;Kampfbund&quot; were scurrying around to arm themselves from secret caches, and seizing buildings. At around 03:00, the first casualties of the putsch occurred when the local garrison of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; spotted Röhm&#x27;s men coming out of the beer hall. They were ambushed while trying to reach the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; barracks by soldiers and state police; shots were fired, but there were no fatalities on either side. Encountering heavy resistance, Röhm and his men were forced to fall back. In the meantime, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; officers put the whole garrison on alert and called for reinforcements.

In the morning, Hitler ordered the seizure of the as hostages.

By mid-morning on 9 November, Hitler realised that the putsch was going nowhere. The putschists did not know what to do and were about to give up. At this moment, Ludendorff cried out, &quot;Wir marschieren!&quot; (&#x27;We will march!&#x27;). Röhm&#x27;s force together with Hitler&#x27;s (a total of approximately 2000 men) marched out – but with no specific destination. On the spur of the moment, Ludendorff led them to the Bavarian Defence Ministry. However, at the &quot;Odeonsplatz&quot; in front of the &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot;, they met a force of 130 soldiers blocking the way under the command of State Police Senior Lieutenant . The two groups exchanged fire, which resulted in the deaths of 16 Nazis, four police officers, and one bystander.

Although their defeat by the government forces forced Hitler and Ludendorff to flee Munich, it was the origin of the &quot;Blutfahne&quot; (&#x27;blood flag&#x27;), which was stained with the blood of two SA members who were shot: the flag bearer Heinrich Trambauer, who was badly wounded, and Andreas Bauriedl, who fell dead onto the fallen flag. A bullet killed Scheubner-Richter. Göring was shot in the leg, but escaped. The rest of the Nazis scattered or were arrested. Hitler was arrested two days later.

In a description of Ludendorff&#x27;s funeral at the &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot; in 1937 (which Hitler attended but without speaking) William L. Shirer wrote: &quot;The World War [One] hero [Ludendorff] had refused to have anything to do with him [Hitler] ever since he had fled from in front of the Feldherrnhalle after the volley of bullets during the Beer Hall Putsch.&quot; However, when a consignment of papers relating to Landsberg prison (including the visitor book) was later sold at auction, it was noted that Ludendorff had visited Hitler a number of times. The case of the resurfacing papers was reported in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; on 23 June 2006; the new information (which came out more than 30 years after Shirer wrote his book, and which Shirer did not have access to) nullifies Shirer&#x27;s statement.

=== Counterattack === 
Police units were first notified of trouble by three police detectives stationed at the &quot;Löwenbräukeller&quot;. These reports reached Major Sigmund von Imhoff of the state police. He immediately called all his green police units and had them seize the central telegraph office and the telephone exchange, although his most important act was to notify Major-General Jakob von Danner, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; city commandant of Munich. As a proud war hero, Danner loathed the &quot;little corporal&quot; and those &quot;&quot;Freikorps&quot; bands of rowdies&quot;. He also did not much like his commanding officer, Generalleutnant Otto von Lossow, &quot;a sorry figure of a man&quot;. He was determined to put down the putsch with or without Lossow. Danner set up a command post at the 19th Infantry Regiment barracks and alerted all military units.

Meanwhile, Captain Karl Wild, learning of the putsch from marchers, mobilised his command to guard Kahr&#x27;s government building, the &quot;Commissariat&quot;, with orders to shoot.

Around 23:00, Major-General von Danner, along with fellow generals and Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein, compelled Lossow to repudiate the putsch.

There was one member of the cabinet who was not at the Bürgerbräukeller: Franz Matt, the vice-premier and minister of education and culture. A staunchly conservative Roman Catholic, he was having dinner with the Archbishop of Munich, Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, and with the Nuncio to Bavaria, Archbishop Eugenio Pacelli (who would later become Pope Pius XII), when he learned of the putsch. He immediately telephoned Kahr. When he found the man vacillating and unsure, Matt made plans to set up a rump government-in-exile in Regensburg and composed a proclamation calling upon all police officers, members of the armed forces, and civil servants to remain loyal to the government. The action of these few men spelt doom for those attempting the putsch. The next day the archbishop and Rupprecht visited Kahr and persuaded him to repudiate Hitler.

Three thousand students from the University of Munich rioted and marched to the &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot; to lay wreaths. They continued to riot until 9 November, when they learned of Hitler&#x27;s arrest. Kahr and Lossow were called Judases and traitors.

== Trial and prison ==

Two days after the putsch, Hitler was arrested and charged with high treason in the special People&#x27;s Court. Some of his fellow conspirators, including Rudolf Hess, were also arrested, while others, including Hermann Göring and Ernst Hanfstaengl, escaped to Austria. The Nazi Party&#x27;s headquarters was raided, and its newspaper, the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; (&quot;The People&#x27;s Observer&quot;), was banned. In January 1924, the Emminger Reform, an emergency decree, abolished the jury as trier of fact and replaced it with a mixed system of judges and lay judges in Germany&#x27;s judiciary.

This was not the first time Hitler had been in trouble with the law. In an incident in September 1921, he and some men of the SA had disrupted a meeting of the &quot;Bayernbund&quot; (&#x27;Bavaria Union&#x27;) which Otto Ballerstedt, a Bavarian federalist, was to have addressed, and the Nazi troublemakers were arrested as a result. Hitler ended up serving just over a month of a three-month jail sentence. Judge Georg Neithardt was the presiding judge at both of Hitler&#x27;s trials.

Hitler&#x27;s trial began on 26 February 1924 and lasted until 1 April 1924. Lossow acted as chief witness for the prosecution. Hitler moderated his tone for the trial, centring his defence on his selfless devotion to the good of the people and the need for bold action to save them, dropping his usual anti-Semitism. He claimed the putsch had been his sole responsibility, inspiring the title &quot;Führer&quot; or &#x27;leader&#x27;. The lay judges were fanatically pro-Nazi and had to be dissuaded by the presiding Judge, Georg Neithardt, from acquitting Hitler outright. Hitler and Hess were both sentenced to five years in &quot;&quot; (&#x27;fortress confinement&#x27;) for treason. &quot;Festungshaft&quot; was the mildest of the three types of jail sentence available in German law at the time; it excluded forced labour, provided reasonably comfortable cells, and allowed the prisoner to receive visitors almost daily for many hours. This was the customary sentence for those whom the judge believed to have had honourable but misguided motives, and it did not carry the stigma of a sentence of &quot;Gefängnis&quot; (common prison) or &quot;Zuchthaus&quot; (disciplinary prison). In the end, Hitler served just over eight months of this sentence before his early release for good behaviour. Prison officials allegedly wanted to give Hitler deaf guards, to prevent him from persuading them to free him.

Although the trial was the first time that Hitler&#x27;s oratory was insufficient, he used the trial as an opportunity to spread his ideas by giving speeches in the courtroom. The event was extensively covered in the newspapers the next day. The judges were impressed (Presiding Judge Neithardt was inclined to favouritism towards the defendants prior to the trial), and as a result, Hitler served just over eight months in prison and was fined . Due to Ludendorff&#x27;s story that he was present by accident, an explanation he had also used in the Kapp Putsch, along with his war service and connections, Ludendorff was acquitted. Both Röhm and Wilhelm Frick, though found guilty, were released. Göring, meanwhile, had fled after suffering a bullet wound to his leg, which led him to become increasingly dependent on morphine and other painkilling drugs. This addiction continued throughout his life.

One of Hitler&#x27;s greatest worries at the trial was that he was at risk of being deported back to his native Austria by the Bavarian government. The trial judge, Neithardt, was sympathetic toward Hitler and held that the relevant laws of the Weimar Republic could not be applied to a man &quot;who thinks and feels like a German, as Hitler does.&quot; The result was that the Nazi leader remained in Germany.

Though Hitler failed to achieve his immediate goal, the putsch did give the Nazis their first national attention and propaganda victory. While serving their &quot;fortress confinement&quot; sentences at Landsberg am Lech, Hitler, Emil Maurice and Rudolf Hess wrote &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. The putsch had changed Hitler&#x27;s outlook on violent revolution to effect change. From then his &quot;modus operandi&quot; was to do everything &quot;strictly legal&quot;.

The process of &quot;combination&quot;, wherein the conservative-nationalist-monarchist group thought that its members could piggyback on, and control, the National Socialist movement to garner the seats of power, was to repeat itself ten years later in 1933 when Franz von Papen asked Hitler to form a legal coalition government.

== Fatalities ==

* (April 23, 1887 – November 9, 1923)
* (May 15, 1897 – November 9, 1923)
* (1902 or 1903 – November 9, 1923)
* (July 4, 1886 – November 9, 1923)

=== Putschists ===

The 15 deceased are listed in Hitler&#x27;s dedication to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.
* Felix Allfarth, merchant, born 5 July 1901 in Leipzig. Alfarth had studied merchandising at the Siemens-Schuckert Works and moved to Munich in 1923 to begin his career.
* Andreas Bauriedl, hatter and World War I veteran, born 4 May 1879 in Aschaffenburg. Bauriedl was hit in the abdomen, killing him and causing him to fall on the Nazi flag, which had fallen to the ground when its flagbearer, Heinrich Trambauer, was severely wounded. Bauriedl&#x27;s blood-soaked flag later became the Nazi relic known as the &quot;Blutfahne&quot;. Member of the Nazi Party.
* Theodor Casella, bank clerk and World War I veteran, born 8 August 1900. Member of the Freikorps and Nazi Party.
* Wilhelm Ehrlich, bank clerk and World War I veteran, born 8 August 1894. Member of the Freikorps and Nazi Party. Previous participant in the Kapp Putsch.
* Martin Faust, bank clerk and World War I veteran, born 4 January 1901.
* Anton Hechenberger, locksmith, born 28 September 1902. Member of the Nazi Party and Sturmabteilung.
* Oskar Körner, businessman and World War I veteran, born 4 January 1875 in Ober-Peilau. Member of the German Workers&#x27; Party and Nazi Party.
* Karl Laforce, engineering student, born 28 October 1904; the youngest to die in the putsch. Member of the Nazi Party, Sturmabteilung, and Stoßtrupp-Hitler.
* Kurt Neubauer, valet for Erich Ludendorff and World War I veteran, born 27 March 1899 in Hopfengarten, Kreis Bernberg. Member of the Freikorps.
* Klaus von Pape, businessman, born 16 August 1904 in Oschatz.
* Theodor von der Pfordten, judge and World War I veteran, born 14 May 1873 in Bayreuth. Member of the German National People&#x27;s Party. During his time as the commandant of a prisoner of war camp in Traunstein, Pfordten was implicated in the abuse of prisoners of war, particularly Russians.
* Johann Rickmers, retired cavalry captain and World War I veteran; born 7 May 1881 in Bremen. Member of the Freikorps.
* Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter, Nazi leader, born 21 January 1884 in Riga. Member of the Nazi Party. Previous participant in the Kapp Putsch.
* Lorenz Ritter von Stransky-Griffenfeld, engineer and World War I veteran, born 14 March 1889. Member of the Freikorps, Nazi Party, and Sturmabteilung.
* Wilhelm Wolf, businessman and World War I veteran, born 19 October 1898. Member of the Freikorps and Nazi Party.

Scheubner-Richter was walking arm-in-arm with Hitler during the putsch; he was shot in the lungs and died instantly. He brought Hitler down and dislocated Hitler&#x27;s shoulder when he fell. He was the only significant Nazi leader to die during the putsch. Of all the party members who died in the putsch, Hitler claimed Scheubner-Richter to be the only &quot;irreplaceable loss&quot;.

According to Ernst Röhm, Martin Faust and Theodor Casella, both members of the armed militia organisation &quot;Reichskriegsflagge&quot;, were shot down accidentally in a burst of machine gun fire during the occupation of the War Ministry as the result of a misunderstanding with II/Infantry Regiment 19.

Also honoured as a martyr in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; was Karl Kuhn (born 7 July 1875), a head waiter in a restaurant. Allegedly he took part in the putsch as a member of the Freikorps Oberland, and was fatally shot by the police. In reality, Kuhn was an innocent bystander. He was working as a waiter in a nearby restaurant when he stepped outside to watch, after which he was killed in the crossfire.

==Legacy==


The 15 fallen insurgents, as well as the bystander Karl Kuhn, were regarded as the first &quot;blood martyrs&quot; of the Nazi Party and were remembered by Hitler in the foreword of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. The Nazi flag they carried, which in the course of events had been stained with blood, came to be known as the &quot;Blutfahne&quot; (&#x27;blood flag&#x27;) and was brought out for the swearing-in of new recruits in front of the &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot; when Hitler was in power.

Shortly after he came to power, a memorial was placed at the south side of the &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot; crowned with a swastika. The back of the memorial read &quot;Und ihr habt doch gesiegt!&quot; (&#x27;And you triumphed nevertheless!&#x27;). Behind it, flowers were laid, and either policemen or the SS stood guard between a lower plaque. Passers-by were required to give the Nazi salute. The putsch was also commemorated on three sets of stamps. &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; was dedicated to the fallen and, in the book &quot;Ich Kämpfe&quot; (given to those joining the party c. 1943), they are listed first even though the book lists hundreds of other dead. The header text in the book read &quot;Though they are dead for their acts they will live on forever.&quot; The army had a division named the Feldherrnhalle Regiment, and there was also an SA Feldherrnhalle Division.

&quot;Der neunte Elfte&quot; (9 November, literally &#x27;the ninth of the eleventh&#x27;) became one of the most important dates on the Nazi calendar, especially following the seizure of power in 1933. Annually until the fall of Nazi Germany, the putsch would be commemorated nationwide, with the major events taking place in Munich. On the night of 8 November, Hitler would address the &quot;Alte Kämpfer&quot; (&#x27;Old Fighters&#x27;) in the Bürgerbräukeller (after 1939, the Löwenbräu, in 1944 in the Circus Krone Building), followed the next day by a re-enactment of the march through the streets of Munich. The event would climax with a ceremony recalling the 16 killed on the Königsplatz.

The anniversary could be a time of tension in Nazi Germany. The ceremony was cancelled in 1934, coming as it did after the so-called Night of the Long Knives. In 1938, it coincided with the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, and in 1939 with the attempted assassination of Hitler by Johann Georg Elser. With the outbreak of war in 1939, security concerns caused the re-enactment of the march to be suspended, never to be resumed. However, Hitler continued to deliver his 8 November speech through 1943. In 1944, Hitler skipped the event and Heinrich Himmler spoke in his place. As the war went on, residents of Munich came increasingly to dread the approach of the anniversary, concerned that the presence of the top Nazi leaders in their city would act as a magnet for Allied bombers.

Every Gau (administrative region of Germany) was also expected to hold a small remembrance ceremony. As material given to propagandists said, the 16 fallen were the first losses and the ceremony was an occasion to commemorate everyone who had died for the movement.

On 9 November 1935, the dead were taken from their graves and to the &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot;. The SA and SS carried them down to the &quot;Königsplatz&quot;, where two &quot;Ehrentempel&quot; (&#x27;honour temples&#x27;) had been constructed. In each of the structures, eight of the dead Nazis were interred in a sarcophagus bearing their name.

In June 1945 the Allied Commission removed the bodies from the Ehrentempels and contacted their families. They were given the option of having their loved ones buried in Munich cemeteries in unmarked graves or having them cremated, a common practice in Germany for unclaimed bodies. On 9 January 1947, the upper parts of the structures were blown up.

Since 1994, a commemorative plaque embedded in the pavement in front of the &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot; contains the names of the four Bavarian policemen who died in the fight against the Nazis. The plaque reads:

In 2010, Munich Mayor Christian Ude and Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann unveiled a memorial plaque at the Munich Residence, after which the base plate was removed in 2011 and handed over to the city museum.

† Bormann and Höss were awaiting trial after their assassination of Walther Kadow on behalf of the movement, supposedly avenging his alleged betrayal of Leo Schlageter a resistance fighter much admired by members of the paramilitary right during the occupation of the Ruhr who had been executed by French authorities in May of 1923. Evidence connecting Kadow to Schlageter&#x27;s discovery, arrest and execution was later found to be utterly lacking. Thus—while these two were not actually present in the ranks of the stormtroopers on the night of the Putsch—their actions, eventual promotions and the various rewards or preference* shown to them within the hierarchy of the Third Reich on the strength of having served time in prison for actions undertaken on behalf of the party underline their significance as exemplars of Nazism, and particularly of &#x27;the Old Fighters&#x27; who had already pledged allegiance to Hitler by the time of the first strike against the Republic.
†† Though Helene Hanfstaengl was not in the streets during the main action of the Putsch, it was to the Hanfstaengl&#x27;s residence that Hitler fled after the collapse of the rebellion and it was she who prevented him from committing suicide when the police arrived to arrest him.

=== At the front of the march ===
In the vanguard were four flag bearers followed by Adolf Lenk and Kurt Neubauer, Ludendorff&#x27;s servant. Behind those two came more flag bearers, then the leadership in two rows.

Hitler was in the centre, slouch hat in hand, the collar of his trenchcoat turned up against the cold. To his left, in civilian clothes, a green felt hat, and a loose loden coat, was Ludendorff. To Hitler&#x27;s right was Scheubner-Richter. To his right came Alfred Rosenberg. On either side of these men were Ulrich Graf, Hermann Kriebel, Friedrich Weber, Julius Streicher, Hermann Göring, and Wilhelm Brückner.

Behind these came the second string of Heinz Pernet, Johann Aigner (Scheubner-Richter&#x27;s servant), Gottfried Feder, Theodor von der Pfordten, Wilhelm Kolb, Rolf Reiner, Hans Streck, and Heinrich Bennecke, Brückner&#x27;s adjutant.

Behind this row marched the &quot;Stoßtrupp-Hitler&quot;, the SA, the Infantry School, and the &quot;Oberländer&quot;.

<text>Ulysses ( , ) was a robotic space probe whose primary mission was to orbit the Sun and study it at all latitudes. It was launched in 1990 and made three &quot;fast latitude scans&quot; of the Sun in 1994/1995, 2000/2001, and 2007/2008. In addition, the probe studied several comets. &quot;Ulysses&quot; was a joint venture of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the United States&#x27; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), under leadership of ESA with participation from Canada&#x27;s National Research Council. The last day for mission operations on &quot;Ulysses&quot; was 30 June 2009.

To study the Sun at all latitudes, the probe needed to change its orbital inclination and leave the plane of the Solar System. To change the orbital inclination of a spacecraft to about 80° requires a large change in heliocentric velocity, the energy to achieve which far exceeded the capabilities of any launch vehicle. To reach the desired orbit around the Sun, the mission&#x27;s planners chose a gravity assist maneuver around Jupiter, but this Jupiter encounter meant that &quot;Ulysses&quot; could not be powered by solar cells. The probe was powered instead by a General Purpose Heat Source Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (GPHS-RTG).

The spacecraft was originally named Odysseus, because of its lengthy and indirect trajectory to study the solar poles. It was renamed &quot;Ulysses&quot;, the Latin translation of &quot;Odysseus&quot;, at ESA&#x27;s request in honor not only of Homer&#x27;s mythological hero but also of Dante&#x27;s character in the &quot;Inferno&quot;. &quot;Ulysses&quot; was originally scheduled for launch in May 1986 aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; on STS-61-F. Due to the 28 January 1986 loss of &quot;Challenger&quot;, the launch of &quot;Ulysses&quot; was delayed until 6 October 1990 aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; (mission STS-41).

== Spacecraft ==
The spacecraft was designed by ESA and built by Dornier Systems, a German aircraft manufacturer. The body was roughly a box, approximately in size. The box mounted the dish antenna and the GPHS-RTG radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) power source. The box was divided into noisy and quiet sections. The noisy section abutted the RTG; the quiet section housed the instrument electronics. Particularly &quot;loud&quot; components, such as the preamps for the radio dipole, were mounted outside the structure entirely, and the box acted as a Faraday cage.

&quot;Ulysses&quot; was spin-stabilised about its z-axis which roughly coincides with the axis of the dish antenna. The RTG, whip antennas, and instrument boom were placed to stabilize this axis, with the spin rate nominally at 5 rpm. Inside the body was a hydrazine fuel tank. Hydrazine monopropellant was used for course corrections inbound to Jupiter, and later used exclusively to repoint the spin axis (and thus, the antenna) at Earth. The spacecraft was controlled by eight thrusters in two blocks. Thrusters were pulsed in the time domain to perform rotation or translation. Four Sun sensors detected orientation. For fine attitude control, the S-band antenna feed was mounted slightly off-axis. This offset feed combined with the spacecraft spin introduced an apparent oscillation to a radio signal transmitted from Earth when received on board the spacecraft. The amplitude and phase of this oscillation were proportional to the orientation of the spin axis relative to the Earth direction. This method of determining the relative orientation is called conical scanning and was used by early radars for automated tracking of targets and was also very common in early infrared guided missiles.

The spacecraft used S-band for uplinked commands and downlinked telemetry, through dual redundant 5-watt transceivers. The spacecraft used X-band for science return (downlink only), using dual 20 watts TWTAs until the failure of the last remaining TWTA in January 2008. Both bands used the dish antenna with prime-focus feeds, unlike the Cassegrain feeds of most other spacecraft dishes.

Dual tape recorders, each of approximately 45-megabit capacity, stored science data between the nominal eight-hour communications sessions during the prime and extended mission phases.

The spacecraft was designed to withstand both the heat of the inner Solar System and the cold at Jupiter&#x27;s distance. Extensive blanketing and electric heaters protected the probe against the cold temperatures of the outer Solar System.

Multiple computer systems (CPUs/microprocessors/Data Processing Units) are used in several of the scientific instruments, including several radiation-hardened RCA CDP1802 microprocessors. Documented 1802 usage includes dual-redundant 1802s in the COSPIN, and at least one 1802 each in the GRB, HI-SCALE, SWICS, SWOOPS and URAP instruments, with other possible microprocessors incorporated elsewhere.

Total mass at launch was , of which 33.5 kg was hydrazine propellant used for attitude control and orbit correction.

== Instruments ==

The twelve different Instruments came from ESA and NASA. The first design was based on two probes, one by NASA and one by ESA, but the probe of NASA was defunded and in the end the instruments of the cancelled probe were mounted on &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

* Radio/Plasma antennas: Two beryllium copper antennas were unreeled outwards from the body, perpendicular to the RTG and spin axis. Together this dipole spanned 72 meters (236.2 ft). A third antenna, of hollow beryllium copper, was deployed from the body, along the spin axis opposite the dish. It was a monopole antenna, 7.5 meters (24.6 ft) long. These measured radio waves generated by plasma releases, or the plasma itself as it passed over the spacecraft. This receiver ensemble was sensitive from DC to 1 MHz.
* Experiment Boom: A third type of boom, shorter and much more rigid, extended from the last side of the spacecraft, opposite the RTG. This was a hollow carbon-fiber tube, of 50 mm (2 in.) diameter. It can be seen in the photo as the silver rod stowed alongside the body. It carried four types of instruments: a solid-state X-ray instrument, composed of two silicon detectors, to study X-rays from solar flares and Jupiter&#x27;s aurorae; the Gamma-Ray Burst experiment, consisting of two CsI scintillator crystals with photomultipliers; two different magnetometers, a helium vector magnetometer and a fluxgate magnetometer; and a two-axis magnetic search coil antenna measured AC magnetic fields.
* Body-Mounted Instruments: Detectors for electrons, ions, neutral gas, dust, and cosmic rays were mounted on the spacecraft body around the quiet section.
* Lastly, the radio communications link could be used to search for gravitational waves (through Doppler shifts) and to probe the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere through radio occultation. No gravitational waves were detected.
* Total instrument mass was 55 kg.
* Magnetometer (MAG): MAG measured the magnetic field in the heliosphere. Measurements of Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field were also performed. Two magnetometers performed &quot;Ulysses&quot;″ magnetic field measurements, the Vector Helium Magnetometer and the Fluxgate Magnetometer.
* Solar Wind Plasma Experiment (SWOOPS): detected the solar wind at all solar distances and latitudes and in three dimensions. It measured positive ions and electrons.
* Solar Wind Ion Composition Instrument (SWICS): determined composition, temperature and speed of the atoms and ions that comprise the solar wind.
* Unified Radio and Plasma Wave Instrument (URAP): picked up radio waves from the Sun and electromagnetic waves generated in the solar wind close to the spacecraft.
* Energetic Particle Instrument (EPAC) and GAS: EPAC investigated the energy, fluxes and distribution of energetic particles in the heliosphere. GAS studied the uncharged gases (helium) of interstellar origin.
* Low-Energy Ion and Electron Experiment (HI-SCALE): investigated the energy, fluxes and distribution of energetic particles in the heliosphere.
* Cosmic Ray and Solar Particle Instrument (COSPIN): investigated the energy, fluxes and distribution of energetic particles and galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere.
* Solar X-ray and Cosmic Gamma-Ray Burst Instrument (GRB): studied cosmic gamma ray bursts and X-rays from solar flares.
* Dust Experiment (DUST): Direct measurements of interplanetary and interstellar dust grains to investigate their properties as functions of the distance from the Sun and solar latitude.

== Mission ==
=== Planning ===

Until &quot;Ulysses&quot;, the Sun had only been observed from low solar latitudes. The Earth&#x27;s orbit defines the ecliptic plane, which differs from the Sun&#x27;s equatorial plane by only 7.25°. Even spacecraft directly orbiting the Sun do so in planes close to the ecliptic because a direct launch into a high-inclination solar orbit would require a prohibitively large launch vehicle.

Several spacecraft (Mariner 10, Pioneer 11, and &quot;Voyagers 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;) had performed gravity assist maneuvers in the 1970s. Those maneuvers were to reach other planets also orbiting close to the ecliptic, so they were mostly in-plane changes. However, gravity assists are not limited to in-plane maneuvers; a suitable flyby of Jupiter could produce a significant plane change. An Out-Of-The-Ecliptic mission (OOE) was thereby proposed. &quot;See article&quot; Pioneer H.

Originally, two spacecraft were to be built by NASA and ESA, as the International Solar Polar Mission. One would be sent over Jupiter, then under the Sun. The other would fly under Jupiter, then over the Sun. This would provide simultaneous coverage. Due to cutbacks, the U.S. spacecraft was cancelled in 1981. One spacecraft was designed, and the project recast as &quot;Ulysses,&quot; due to the indirect and untried flight path. NASA would provide the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) and launch services, ESA would build the spacecraft assigned to Astrium GmbH, Friedrichshafen, Germany (formerly Dornier Systems). The instruments would be split into teams from universities and research institutes in Europe and the United States. This process provided the 12 instruments on board.

The changes delayed launch from February 1983 to May 1986 when it was to be deployed by the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; (boosted by the proposed Centaur G Prime upper stage). However, the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster forced a two-and-a-half year stand down of the shuttle fleet, mandated the cancellation of the Centaur-G upper stage, and pushed the launch date to October 1990.

=== Launch ===
&quot;Ulysses&quot; was deployed into low Earth orbit from the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. From there, it was propelled on a trajectory to Jupiter by a combination of solid rocket motors. This upper stage consisted of a two-stage Boeing IUS (Inertial Upper Stage), plus a McDonnell Douglas PAM-S (Payload Assist Module-Special). The IUS was inertially stabilised and actively guided during its burn. The PAM-S was unguided and it and &quot;Ulysses&quot; were spun up to 80 rpm for stability at the start of its burn. On burnout of the PAM-S, the motor and spacecraft stack was yo-yo de-spun (weights deployed at the end of cables) to below 8 rpm prior to separation of the spacecraft. On leaving Earth, the spacecraft became the fastest ever artificially-accelerated spacecraft, and held that title until the &quot;New Horizons&quot; probe was launched.

On its way to Jupiter, the spacecraft was in an elliptical non-Hohmann transfer orbit. At this time, &quot;Ulysses&quot; had a low orbital inclination to the ecliptic.

=== Jupiter swing-by ===

It made its closest approach of 6.31 planetary radii from Jupiter on 8 February 1992 during a swing-by maneuver that increased its inclination to the ecliptic by 80.2°. The giant planet&#x27;s gravity bent the spacecraft&#x27;s flight path southward and away from the ecliptic plane. This put it into a final orbit around the Sun that would take it past the Sun&#x27;s north and south poles. The size and shape of the orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree so that aphelion remained at approximately 5 AU, Jupiter&#x27;s distance from the Sun, and perihelion was somewhat greater than 1 AU, the Earth&#x27;s distance from the Sun. The orbital period is approximately six years.

=== Polar regions of the Sun ===

Between 1994 and 1995 it explored both the southern and northern polar regions of the Sun, respectively.

=== Comet C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake) ===
On 1 May 1996, the spacecraft unexpectedly crossed the ion tail of Comet Hyakutake (C/1996 B2), revealing the tail to be at least 3.8 AU in length.

=== Comet C/1999 T1 (McNaught–Hartley) ===
An encounter with a comet tail happened again in 2004 when &quot;Ulysses&quot; flew through the ion tailings of C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley). A coronal mass ejection carried the cometary material to &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

=== Second Jupiter encounter ===
&quot;Ulysses&quot; approached aphelion in 2003/2004 and made further distant observations of Jupiter.

=== Comet C/2006 P1 (McNaught) ===
In 2007, &quot;Ulysses&quot; passed through the tail of comet C/2006 P1 (McNaught). The results were surprisingly different from its pass through Hyakutake&#x27;s tail, with the measured solar wind velocity dropping from approximately 700 kilometers per second (1,566,000 mph) to less than 400 kilometers per second (895,000 mph).

=== Extended mission ===
ESA&#x27;s Science Program Committee approved the fourth extension of the &quot;Ulysses&quot; mission to March 2004 thereby allowing it to operate over the Sun&#x27;s poles for the third time in 2007 and 2008. After it became clear that the power output from the spacecraft&#x27;s RTG would be insufficient to operate science instruments and keep the attitude control fuel, hydrazine, from freezing, instrument power sharing was initiated. Up until then, the most important instruments had been kept online constantly, whilst others were deactivated. When the probe neared the Sun, its power-hungry heaters were turned off and all instruments were turned on.

On 22 February 2008, 17 years and 4 months after the launch of the spacecraft, ESA and NASA announced that the mission operations for &quot;Ulysses&quot; would likely cease within a few months. On 12 April 2008, NASA announced that the end date will be 1 July 2008.

The spacecraft operated successfully for over four times its design life. A component within the last remaining working chain of X-band downlink subsystem failed on 15 January 2008. The other chain in the X-band subsystem had previously failed in 2003.

Downlink to Earth resumed on S-band, but the beamwidth of the high gain antenna in the S-band was not as narrow as in the X–band, so that the received downlink signal was much weaker, hence reducing the achievable data rate. As the spacecraft traveled on its outbound trajectory to the orbit of Jupiter, the downlink signal would have eventually fallen below the receiving capability of even the largest antennas (70 meters - 229.7 feet - in diameter) of the Deep Space Network.

Even before the downlink signal was lost due to distance, the hydrazine attitude control fuel on board the spacecraft was considered likely to freeze, as the radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) failed to generate enough power for the heaters to overcome radiative heat loss into space. Once the hydrazine froze, the spacecraft would no longer be able to maneuver to keep its high gain antenna pointing towards Earth, and the downlink signal would then be lost in a matter of days. The failure of the X-band communications subsystem hastened this, because the coldest part of the fuel pipework was routed over the X-band traveling-wave tube amplifiers, because they generated enough heat during operation to keep the propellant plumbing warm.

The previously announced mission end date of 1 July 2008, came and went but mission operations continued albeit in a reduced capacity. The availability of science data gathering was limited to only when &quot;Ulysses&quot; was in contact with a ground station due to the deteriorating S-band downlink margin no longer being able to support simultaneous real-time data and tape recorder playback. When the spacecraft was out of contact with a ground station, the S-band transmitter was switched off and the power was diverted to the internal heaters to add to the warming of the hydrazine. On 30 June 2009, ground controllers sent commands to switch to the low gain antennas. This stopped communications with the spacecraft, in combination with previous commands to shut down its transmitter entirely.

== Results ==
During cruise phases, &quot;Ulysses&quot; provided unique data. As the only spacecraft out of the ecliptic with a gamma-ray instrument, &quot;Ulysses&quot; was an important part of the InterPlanetary Network (IPN). The IPN detects gamma ray bursts (GRBs); since gamma rays cannot be focused with mirrors, it was very difficult to locate GRBs with enough accuracy to study them further. Instead, several spacecraft can locate the burst through multilateration. Each spacecraft has a gamma-ray detector, with readouts noted in tiny fractions of a second. By comparing the arrival times of gamma showers with the separations of the spacecraft, a location can be determined, for follow-up with other telescopes. Because gamma rays travel at the speed of light, wide separations are needed. Typically, a determination came from comparing: one of several spacecraft orbiting the Earth, an inner-Solar-System probe (to Mars, Venus, or an asteroid), and &quot;Ulysses&quot;. When &quot;Ulysses&quot; crossed the ecliptic twice per orbit, many GRB determinations lost accuracy.

Additional discoveries:
* Data provided by &quot;Ulysses&quot; led to the discovery that the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field interacts with the Solar System in a more complex fashion than previously assumed.
* Data provided by &quot;Ulysses&quot; led to the discovery that dust coming into the Solar System from deep space was 30 times more abundant than previously expected.
* In 2007–2008 data provided by &quot;Ulysses&quot; led to the determination that the magnetic field emanating from the Sun&#x27;s poles is much weaker than previously observed.
* That the solar wind has &quot;grown progressively weaker during the mission and is currently at its weakest since the start of the Space Age&quot;.

==Fate==
&quot;Ulysses&quot; will most likely continue in heliocentric orbit around the Sun indefinitely. However, there is a chance that in one of its re-encounters with Jupiter a close fly-by with one of the Jovian moons would be enough to alter its course and so the probe would enter a hyperbolic trajectory around the Sun and leave the Solar System.

<text>Robert Mearns Yerkes (; May 26, 1876 – February 3, 1956) was an American psychologist, ethologist, eugenicist and primatologist best known for his work in intelligence testing and in the field of comparative psychology.

Yerkes was a pioneer in the study both of human and primate intelligence and of the social behavior of gorillas and chimpanzees. Along with John D. Dodson, Yerkes developed the Yerkes–Dodson law relating arousal to performance.

As time went on, Yerkes began to propagate his support for eugenics in the 1910s and 1920s. His works are largely considered biased toward outmoded racialist theories by modern academics.

He also served on the board of trustees of Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1921 to 1925. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1915, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1923, and the American Philosophical Society in 1936.

==Education and early career==
Robert Yerkes was born in Breadysville, Pennsylvania (near Ivyland, Pennsylvania). Growing up on a farm in rural Pennsylvania, Robert Yerkes wanted to leave the hard life of the rural farmer and become a physician. With the financial help of an uncle, Yerkes attended Ursinus College from 1892 to 1897. Upon graduating he received an offer from Harvard University to do graduate work in Biology. Faced with a choice of Harvard or medical training in Philadelphia, he chose to go to Harvard.

At Harvard, Yerkes became interested in animal behavior, so much so that he put off further medical training to study comparative psychology. He earned his Ph.D. in the Psychology Department in 1902.

His early career was strongly influenced by the debts Yerkes incurred paying for school. Upon his graduation from Harvard, he took up a position with the school as an instructor and assistant professor in comparative psychology. He had to supplement his income during the summer for several years by teaching general psychology at Radcliffe College. Another part-time job he took on was being the director of psychological research at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.

In 1907, Yerkes published his first book, &quot;The Dancing Mouse&quot;. Among his friends during this time was future behaviorist John Watson, with whom he exchanged ideas and collaborated. He was also a member of the Wicht Club (1903–1911).

==Intelligence testing and eugenics==

In 1917, Yerkes served as president of the American Psychological Association (APA). Under his influence, the APA began several programs devoted to the war effort in World War I. As chairman of the Committee on the Psychological Examination of Recruits, he developed the Army Alpha and Army Beta Intelligence Tests, the first nonverbal group tests, which were given to over 1 million United States soldiers during the war.

Although Yerkes claimed that the tests measured native intelligence, and not education or training, this claim is difficult to sustain in the face of the questions themselves. Question 18 of Alpha Test 8 reads: &quot;Velvet Joe appears in advertisements of ... (tooth powder)(dry goods)(tobacco)(soap).&quot;

Yerkes used the results of tests such as these to argue that recent immigrants (especially those from Southern and Eastern Europe) scored considerably lower than older waves of immigration (from Northern Europe.) The results would later be criticized as very clearly only measuring acculturation, as the test scores correlated nearly exactly with the number of years spent living in the US. Nonetheless, the effects of Yerkes work would have a lasting effect on American xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment. His work was used as one of the eugenic motivations for harsh and racist immigration restrictions.

He was appointed as an &quot;Expert Eugenic Agent&quot; to The House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, where his work would contribute to the creation of the discriminatory National Origins Formula. In his introduction to Carl C. Brigham&#x27;s &quot;A Study of American Intelligence&quot; (which helped popularize eugenics in the U.S.), Yerkes stated that &quot;no one of us as a citizen can afford to ignore the menace of race deterioration.&quot;

Along with Edward L. Thorndike, Yerkes was a member and Chairman of the Committee on Inheritance of Mental Traits, part of the Eugenics Record Office, which was founded by Charles Benedict Davenport, a former teacher of Yerkes at Harvard.

==National Research Council==
Immediately after World War I, Yerkes worked as a paid officer for the United States National Research Council (NRC) and took the helm of the NRC Committee for Research in Problems of Sex. The Committee for Research in Problems of Sex helped Yerkes establish close relationships with officers from Rockefeller philanthropic foundations. These relationships later helped him to solicit substantial funds for his chimpanzee projects.

==Primatology==
Yerkes had a long and storied fascination with the study of chimpanzees. He began by purchasing two chimpanzees, Chim (a male bonobo) and Panzee (a female common chimpanzee), from a zoo. He brought them home and kept them in a bedroom where they could eat with a fork at a miniature table. Chim was a particular delight for Yerkes, and the summer that chimp and psychologist spent together is memorialized in &quot;Almost Human&quot; (1924). He had spent time in 1924 hosted by Rosalía Abreu at her large primate colony in Cuba. She was the first person to succeed in breeding chimpanzees in captivity. He was accompanied by Harold C. Bingham, Josephine Ball and Chim, the bonobo. Chim unfortunately died during the visit. Yerkes returned from this visit with advice from Abreu to help in raising and observing chimps on his own.

In 1924, Yerkes was hired as a professor of psychobiology, a field he pioneered, at Yale University. He founded the Yale University Laboratories of Primate Biology in New Haven, followed by his Anthropoid Breeding and Experiment Station in Orange Park, Florida, with funds from the Rockefeller Foundation. The primate language Yerkish was developed at Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology. Yerkes retired from his position as Director in 1942, where he was replaced by Karl Lashley. After his death, the lab was moved to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and was then called the Yerkes National Primate Research Center.

Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; it was YER-keez.

==Legacy==
In April 2022, Emory University removed Yerkes’ name from the National Primate Research Center, after a review by Emory&#x27;s Committee on Naming Honors recommended that the name be changed due to Yerkes&#x27; past support for eugenics. The Yerkes National Primate Research Center will be known as the Emory National Primate Research Center, effective June 1, 2022.

<doc id="57541" wikidata="Q176909" url="?curid=57541" title="Walker Percy">
<text>Walker Percy, OblSB (May 28, 1916 – May 10, 1990) was an American writer whose interests included philosophy and semiotics. Percy is noted for his philosophical novels set in and around New Orleans; his first, &quot;The Moviegoer&quot;, won the National Book Award for Fiction.

Trained as a physician at Columbia University, Percy decided to become a writer after a bout of tuberculosis. He devoted his literary life to the exploration of &quot;the dislocation of man in the modern age.&quot; His work displays a combination of existential questioning, Southern sensibility, and deep Catholic faith. He had a lifelong friendship with author and historian Shelby Foote and spent much of his life in Covington, Louisiana, where he died of prostate cancer in 1990.

== Early life and education ==
Percy was born on May 28, 1916, in Birmingham, Alabama, the first of three boys to LeRoy Pratt Percy and Martha Susan Phinizy. His father&#x27;s Mississippi Protestant family included his great-uncle LeRoy Percy, a US senator, and LeRoy Pope Walker, a pro-slavery secessionist in Antebellum America and the first Confederate States Secretary of War during the American Civil War. In February 1917, Percy&#x27;s grandfather died by suicide.

In 1929, when Percy was 13, his father died by suicide. His mother took the family to live at her own mother&#x27;s home in Athens, Georgia. Two years later, Percy&#x27;s mother died in a suspected suicide when she drove a car off a country bridge and into Deer Creek near Leland, Mississippi, where they were visiting. Percy regarded this death as another suicide. Walker and his two younger brothers, LeRoy (Roy) and Phinizy (Phin), were taken in by their first cousin once removed, William Alexander Percy, a bachelor lawyer and poet living in Greenville, Mississippi.

Percy was raised as an agnostic, but he was nominally affiliated with a theologically liberal Presbyterian church. William Percy introduced him to many writers and poets.

Percy attended Greenville High School and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in chemistry and joined the Xi chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He wrote essays and book reviews for the school&#x27;s &quot;Carolina Magazine&quot;. He graduated with a B.A. in 1937.

=== Friendship with Shelby Foote ===
After moving to Greenville, Mississippi, in 1930, Shelby Foote became Percy&#x27;s lifelong best friend. As young men, Percy and Foote decided to visit William Faulkner in Oxford, Mississippi. However, when they arrived at his home, Percy was so in awe of the literary giant that he could not bring himself to speak. Foote and Faulkner had a lively conversation.
Percy and Foote were classmates at both Greenville High School and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Although Foote was not permitted to join Percy&#x27;s fraternity because of his partly Jewish heritage, he and Percy stayed close friends during their two overlapping years. They went on dates together, made regular trips to nearby Durham, North Carolina, to drink and socialize, and journeyed to New York City during one of their semester breaks. When Percy graduated in 1937, Foote dropped out and returned to Greenville.

In the late 1940s, Percy and Foote began a correspondence that lasted until Percy&#x27;s death in 1990. A collection of their correspondence was published in 1996.

== Medical training and tuberculosis ==

Percy received an M.D. from Columbia University&#x27;s College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City in 1941, intending to become a psychiatrist. There, he spent five days a week in psychoanalysis with Janet Rioch, to whom he had been referred by Harry Stack Sullivan, a friend of Uncle Will. After three years, Walker decided to quit the psychoanalysis and later reflected on his treatment as inconclusive. Percy became an intern at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan in 1942 but contracted tuberculosis the same year while he was performing an autopsy at Bellevue. At the time, there was no known treatment for the disease other than rest. While he had only a &quot;minimal lesion&quot; that caused him little pain, he was forced to abandon his medical career and to leave the city. Percy spent several years recuperating at the Trudeau Sanitorium in Saranac Lake, in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York. He spent his time sleeping, reading, and listening to his radio to hear updates on World War II. He was envious of his brothers, who were both enlisted in the war and fighting overseas. During this period, Percy used Trudeau&#x27;s Mellon Library, which held over 7,000 titles. He read the works of Danish existentialist philosopher Søren Kierkegaard as well as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Gabriel Marcel, Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Kafka, and Thomas Mann. He began to question the ability of science to explain the basic mysteries of human existence. He began to rise daily at dawn to attend Mass.

In August 1944, Percy was pronounced healthy enough to leave Trudeau and was discharged. He traveled to New York City to see Huger Jervey, dean of Columbia Law School and a friend of Percy. He then lived for two months in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with his brother Phin, who was on leave from the Navy. In the spring of 1945, Percy returned to Columbia as an instructor of pathology and took up residence with Huger Jervey. In May, an X-ray revealed a resurgence of the bacillus. Percy consequently traveled to Wallingford, Connecticut, to stay at Gaylord Farm Sanatorium.

Years later, Percy reflected on his illness with more fondness than he had then felt at the time: &quot;I was the happiest man ever to contract tuberculosis, because it enabled me to get out of Bellevue and quit medicine.&quot;

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1935, during the winter term of Percy&#x27;s sophomore year at Chapel Hill, he contributed four pieces to &quot;The Carolina Magazine&quot;. According to scholars such as Jay Tolson, Percy proved his knowledge and interest in the good and the bad that accompany contemporary culture with his first contributions. Percy&#x27;s personal experiences at Chapel Hill are portrayed in his first novel, &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; (1961), through the protagonist Binx Bolling. During the years that Percy spent in his fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, he &quot;became known for his dry wit,&quot; which is how Bolling is described by his fraternity brothers in &quot;The Moviegoer&quot;.

Percy had begun in 1947 or 1948 to write a novel called &quot;The Charterhouse&quot;, which was not published and Percy later destroyed. He worked on a second novel, &quot;The Gramercy Winner&quot;, which 
also was never published.

Percy&#x27;s literary career as a Catholic writer began in 1956 with an essay about race in the Catholic magazine &quot;Commonweal&quot;. The essay &quot;Stoicism in the South&quot; condemned Southern segregation and demanded a larger role for Christian thought in Southern life.

=== Later career ===
After many years of writing and rewriting in collaboration with editor Stanley Kauffmann, Percy published his first novel, &quot;The Moviegoer&quot;, in 1961. Percy later wrote of the novel that it was the story of &quot;a young man who had all the advantages of a cultivated old-line southern family: a feel for science and art, a liking for girls, sports cars, and the ordinary things of the culture, but who nevertheless feels himself quite alienated from both worlds, the old South and the new America.&quot;

Later works included &quot;The Last Gentleman&quot; (1966), &quot;Love in the Ruins&quot; (1971), &quot;Lancelot&quot; (1977), &quot;The Second Coming&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Thanatos Syndrome&quot; in 1987. Percy&#x27;s personal life and family legends provided inspiration and played a part in his writing. &quot;The Thanatos Syndrome&quot; features a story about one of Percy&#x27;s ancestors that was taken from a family chronicle written by Percy&#x27;s uncle, Will Percy. Percy&#x27;s vision for the plot of &quot;The Second Coming&quot; came to him after an old fraternity brother visited him in the 1970s. He told Percy the story of his life where he is burned out and does not know what to do next. The trend of Percy&#x27;s personal life influencing his writing seemingly held true throughout his literary career, beginning with his first novel. Percy also published a number of nonfiction works exploring his interests in semiotics and existentialism, his most popular work being &quot;Lost in the Cosmos&quot;.

In 1975, Percy published a collection of essays, &quot;The Message in the Bottle: How Queer Man Is, How Queer Language Is, and What One Has to Do with the Other&quot;. Percy attempted to forge a connection between the idea of Judeo-Christian ethics and rationalized science and behavioralism. According to scholars such as Anne Berthoff and Linda Whitney Hobson, Percy presented a new way of viewing the struggles of the common man by his specific use of anecdotes and language.

Percy taught and mentored younger writers. While teaching at Loyola University of New Orleans, he was instrumental in getting John Kennedy Toole&#x27;s novel &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; published in 1980. That was more than a decade after Toole committed suicide, despondent about being unable to get recognition for his book. Set in New Orleans, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, which was posthumously awarded to Toole.

In 1987, Percy, along with 21 other noted authors, met in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to create the Fellowship of Southern Writers.

== Personal life ==
Percy married Mary Bernice Townsend, a medical technician, on November 7, 1946. Both studied Catholicism and were received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1947. Fearing that Percy was sterile, the married couple adopted a first daughter, Mary Pratt, but later conceived a second daughter, Ann, who became deaf at an early age. The family settled in Covington, Louisiana, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans. Percy&#x27;s wife and one of their daughters later had a bookstore, where the writer often worked in an office on the second floor.

=== Views ===
Percy was strongly anti-abortion. In 1981, he authored a &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion article, in which he called abortion a &quot;banal atrocity&quot;. On another occasion, Percy once told an interviewer:

If I had anything to say to the liberals, it is that I agree with them on almost everything: their political and social causes, and the ACLU, God knows, the right to freedom of speech, to help the homeless, the poor, the minorities, God knows the blacks, the third world—their hearts are in the right place. It’s actually a mystery, a bafflement to me, how they cannot see the paradox of being in favor of these good things and yet not batting an eyelash when it comes to destroying unborn life.

Percy&#x27;s final novel, &quot;The Thanatos Syndrome&quot;, condemns eugenics, senicide, and abortion.

== Illness and death ==
Percy underwent an operation for prostate cancer on March 10, 1988, but it had already metastasized to surrounding tissue and lymph nodes. In July 1989, he volunteered to allow his doctors at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, to use experimental medicines. Percy enrolled in a pilot study to test the effects of the drugs interferon and fluorouracil in cancer patients. In his correspondence with Foote, Percy expressed frustration over the frequent travel and hospital stays: &quot;Hospitals are no place for anyone, let alone a sick man.&quot; Although the side effects of the experimental treatment were debilitating, Percy had a revelation when he saw children with cancer waiting in the lounges. He decided to continue the treatment at Mayo as long as he could so that the results of his treatment might be of value to others.

He died of prostate cancer at his home in Covington in 1990, eighteen days before his 74th birthday. He is buried on the grounds of St. Joseph Benedictine Abbey, in St. Benedict, Louisiana. He had become a secular oblate of the Abbey&#x27;s monastic community, making his final oblation on February 16, 1990, less than three months before his death.

==Legacy and honors==

=== Influence ===
Percy&#x27;s work, which often features protagonists facing displacement, influenced other Southern authors. According to scholar Farrell O&#x27;Gorman, Percy&#x27;s vision helped bring a fundamental change in southern literature where authors began to use characters concerned with &quot;a sense of estrangement&quot;. His writing serves as an example for contemporary southern writers who attempt to combine elements of history, religion, science, and the modern world. Scholars such as Jay Tolson state that Percy&#x27;s frequent use of characters facing spiritual loneliness in the modern world helped introduce different ways of writing in the south post-war.

=== Awards and honors ===
In 1962, Percy was awarded the National Book Award for Fiction for his first novel, &quot;The Moviegoer&quot;.

In 1985, Percy was awarded the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates.

In 1989, the University of Notre Dame awarded Percy its Laetare Medal, which is bestowed annually to a Catholic &quot;whose genius has ennobled the arts and sciences, illustrated the ideals of the Church, and enriched the heritage of humanity&quot;.

Also in 1989, the National Endowment for the Humanities chose him as the winner for the Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities. He read his essay, &quot;The Fateful Rift: The San Andreas Fault in the Modern Mind&quot;.

Loyola University New Orleans has multiple archival and manuscript collections related to Percy&#x27;s life and work.

In 2019, a Mississippi Writers Trail historical marker was installed in Greenville, Mississippi, to honor Percy&#x27;s literary contributions.

<text>Caenorhabditis elegans () is a free-living transparent nematode about 1 mm in length that lives in temperate soil environments. It is the type species of its genus. The name is a blend of the Greek &quot;caeno-&quot; (recent), &quot;rhabditis&quot; (rod-like) and Latin &quot;elegans&quot; (elegant). In 1900, Maupas initially named it &quot;Rhabditides elegans.&quot; Osche placed it in the subgenus &quot;Caenorhabditis&quot; in 1952, and in 1955, Dougherty raised &quot;Caenorhabditis&quot; to the status of genus.

&quot;C. elegans&quot; is an unsegmented pseudocoelomate and lacks respiratory or circulatory systems. Most of these nematodes are hermaphrodites and a few are males. Males have specialised tails for mating that include spicules.

In 1963, Sydney Brenner proposed research into &quot;C. elegans,&quot; primarily in the area of neuronal development. In 1974, he began research into the molecular and developmental biology of &quot;C. elegans&quot;, which has since been extensively used as a model organism. It was the first multicellular organism to have its whole genome sequenced, and in 2019 it was the first organism to have its connectome (neuronal &quot;wiring diagram&quot;) completed.

 four Nobel prizes have been won for work done on &quot;C. elegans.&quot;

==Anatomy==

&quot;C.elegans&quot; is unsegmented, , and bilaterally symmetrical. It has a cuticle (a strong outer covering, as an exoskeleton), four main epidermal cords, and a fluid-filled pseudocoelom (body cavity). It also has some of the same organ systems as larger animals. About one in a thousand individuals is male and the rest are hermaphrodites. The basic anatomy of &quot;C.elegans&quot; includes a mouth, pharynx, intestine, gonad, and collagenous cuticle. Like all nematodes, they have neither a circulatory nor a respiratory system. The four bands of muscles that run the length of the body are connected to a neural system that allows the muscles to move the animal&#x27;s body only as dorsal bending or ventral bending, but not left or right, except for the head, where the four muscle quadrants are wired independently from one another. When a wave of dorsal/ventral muscle contractions proceeds from the back to the front of the animal, the animal is propelled backwards. When a wave of contractions is initiated at the front and proceeds posteriorly along the body, the animal is propelled forwards. Because of this dorsal/ventral bias in body bends, any normal living, moving individual tends to lie on either its left side or its right side when observed crossing a horizontal surface. A set of ridges on the lateral sides of the body cuticle, the alae, is believed to give the animal added traction during these bending motions.

In relation to lipid metabolism, &quot;C.elegans&quot; does not have any specialized adipose tissues, a pancreas, a liver, or even blood to deliver nutrients compared to mammals. Neutral lipids are instead stored in the intestine, epidermis, and embryos. The epidermis corresponds to the mammalian adipocytes by being the main triglyceride depot.

The pharynx is a muscular food pump in the head of &quot;C.elegans&quot;, which is triangular in cross-section. This grinds food and transports it directly to the intestine. A set of &quot;valve cells&quot; connects the pharynx to the intestine, but how this valve operates is not understood. After digestion, the contents of the intestine are released via the rectum, as is the case with all other nematodes. No direct connection exists between the pharynx and the excretory canal, which functions in the release of liquid urine.

Males have a single-lobed gonad, a vas deferens, and a tail specialized for mating, which incorporates spicules. Hermaphrodites have two ovaries, oviducts, and spermatheca, and a single uterus. 

There are 302 neurons in &quot;C.elegans,&quot; approximately one-third of all the somatic cells in the whole body. Many neurons contain dendrites which extend from the cell to receive neurotransmitters or other signals, and a process that extends to the nerve ring (the &quot;brain&quot;) for a synaptic connection with other neurons. &quot;C.elegans&quot; has excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic motor neurons which connect with body wall muscles to regulate movement. In addition, these neurons and other neurons such as interneurons use a variety of neurotransmitters to control behaviors.

=== Gut granules ===

Numerous gut granules are present in the intestine of &quot;C.elegans&quot;, the functions of which are still not fully known, as are many other aspects of this nematode, despite the many years that it has been studied. These gut granules are found in all of the Rhabditida orders. They are very similar to lysosomes in that they feature an acidic interior and the capacity for endocytosis, but they are considerably larger, reinforcing the view of their being storage organelles.
A particular feature of the granules is that when they are observed under ultraviolet light, they react by emitting an intense blue fluorescence. Another phenomenon seen is termed &#x27;death fluorescence&#x27;. As the worms die, a dramatic burst of blue fluorescence is emitted. This death fluorescence typically takes place in an anterior to posterior wave that moves along the intestine, and is seen in both young and old worms, whether subjected to lethal injury or peacefully dying of old age.

Many theories have been posited on the functions of the gut granules, with earlier ones being eliminated by later findings. They are thought to store zinc as one of their functions. Recent chemical analysis has identified the blue fluorescent material they contain as a glycosylated form of anthranilic acid (AA). The need for the large amounts of AA the many gut granules contain is questioned. One possibility is that the AA is antibacterial and used in defense against invading pathogens. Another possibility is that the granules provide photoprotection; the bursts of AA fluorescence entail the conversion of damaging UV light to relatively harmless visible light. This is seen as a possible link to the melanin–containing melanosomes.

== Reproduction ==

The hermaphroditic worm is considered to be a specialized form of self-fertile female, as its soma is female. The hermaphroditic germline produces male gametes first, and lays eggs through its uterus after internal fertilization. Hermaphrodites produce all their sperm in the L4 stage (150 sperm cells per gonadal arm) and then produce only oocytes. The hermaphroditic gonad acts as an ovotestis with sperm cells being stored in the same area of the gonad as the oocytes until the first oocyte pushes the sperm into the spermatheca (a chamber wherein the oocytes become fertilized by the sperm).

The male can inseminate the hermaphrodite, which will preferentially use male sperm (both types of sperm are stored in the spermatheca). 
 The sperm of &quot;C. elegans&quot; is amoeboid, lacking flagella and acrosomes. When self-inseminated, the wild-type worm lays about 300 eggs. When inseminated by a male, the number of progeny can exceed 1,000. Hermaphrodites do not typically mate with other hermaphrodites. At 20 °C, the laboratory strain of &quot;C. elegans&quot; (N2) has an average lifespan around 2–3 weeks and a generation time of 3 to 4 days.

&quot;C. elegans&quot; has five pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Sex in &quot;C. elegans&quot; is based on an X0 sex-determination system. Hermaphrodites of &quot;C. elegans&quot; have a matched pair of sex chromosomes (XX); the rare males have only one sex chromosome (X0).

=== Sex determination ===
&quot;C. elegans&quot; are mostly hermaphroditic organisms, producing both sperms and oocytes. Males do occur in the population in a rate of approximately 1 in 200 hermaphrodites, but the two sexes are highly differentiated. Males differ from their hermaphroditic counterparts in that they are smaller and can be identified through the shape of their tail. &quot;C.elegans&quot; reproduce through a process called androdioecy. This means that they can reproduce in two ways: either through self-fertilization in hermaphrodites or through hermaphrodites breeding with males. Males are produced through non-disjunction of the X chromosomes during meiosis. The worms that reproduce through self-fertilization are at risk for high linkage disequilibrium, which leads to lower genetic diversity in populations and an increase in accumulation of deleterious alleles. In &quot;C. elegans&quot;, somatic sex determination is attributed to the &quot;tra-1&quot; gene. The &quot;tra-1&quot; is a gene within the TRA-1 transcription factor sex determination pathway that is regulated post-transcriptionally and works by promoting female development. In hermaphrodites (XX), there are high levels of &quot;tra-1&quot; activity, which produces the female reproductive system and inhibits male development. At a certain time in their life cycle, one day before adulthood, hermaphrodites can be identified through the addition of a vulva near their tail. In males (XO), there are low levels of &quot;tra-1&quot; activity, resulting in a male reproductive system. Recent research has shown that there are three other genes, &quot;fem-1, fem-2, and fem-3,&quot; that negatively regulate the TRA-1 pathway and act as the final determiner of sex in &quot;C. elegans&quot;.

==== Evolution ====
The sex determination system in &quot;C. elegans&quot; is a topic that has been of interest to scientists for years. Since they are used as a model organism, any information discovered about the way their sex determination system might have evolved could further the same evolutionary biology research in other organisms. After almost 30 years of research, scientists have begun to put together the pieces in the evolution of such a system. What they have discovered is that there is a complex pathway involved that has several layers of regulation. The closely related organism &quot;Caenorhabditis briggsae&quot; has been studied extensively and its whole genome sequence has helped put together the missing pieces in the evolution of &quot;C. elegans&quot; sex determination. It has been discovered that two genes have assimilated, leading to the proteins XOL-1 and MIX-1 having an effect on sex determination in &quot;C. elegans&quot; as well. Mutations in the XOL-1 pathway leads to feminization in &quot;C. elegans .&quot; The &quot;mix-1&quot; gene is known to hypoactivate the X chromosome and regulates the morphology of the male tail in &quot;C. elegans.&quot; Looking at the nematode as a whole, the male and hermaphrodite sex likely evolved from parallel evolution. Parallel evolution is defined as similar traits evolving from an ancestor in similar conditions; simply put, the two species evolve in similar ways over time. An example of this would be marsupial and placental mammals. Scientists have also hypothesized that hermaphrodite asexual reproduction, or &quot;selfing&quot;, could have evolved convergently by studying species similar to &quot;C. elegans&quot; Other studies on the sex determination evolution suggest that genes involving sperm evolve at the faster rate than female genes. However, sperm genes on the X chromosome have reduced evolution rates. Sperm genes have short coding sequences, high codon bias, and disproportionate representation among orphan genes. These characteristics of sperm genes may be the reason for their high rates of evolution and may also suggest how sperm genes evolved out of hermaphrodite worms. Overall, scientists have a general idea of the sex determination pathway in &quot;C. elegans&quot;, however, the evolution of how this pathway came to be is not yet well defined.

==Development==
=== Embryonic development ===
The fertilized zygote undergoes rotational holoblastic cleavage.

Sperm entry into the oocyte commences formation of an anterior-posterior axis. The sperm microtubule organizing center directs the movement of the sperm pronucleus to the future posterior pole of the embryo, while also inciting the movement of PAR proteins, a group of cytoplasmic determination factors, to their proper respective locations. As a result of the difference in PAR protein distribution, the first cell division is highly asymmetric. &quot;C. elegans&quot; embryogenesis is among the best understood examples of asymmetric cell division.

All cells of the germline arise from a single primordial germ cell, called the &quot;P4&quot; cell, established early in embryogenesis. This primordial cell divides to generate two germline precursors that do not divide further until after hatching.

==== Axis formation ====
The resulting daughter cells of the first cell division are called the AB cell (containing PAR-6 and PAR-3) and the P1 cell (containing PAR-1 and PAR-2). A second cell division produces the ABp and ABa cells from the AB cell, and the EMS and P2 cells from the P1 cell. This division establishes the dorsal-ventral axis, with the ABp cell forming the dorsal side and the EMS cell marking the ventral side. Through Wnt signaling, the P2 cell instructs the EMS cell to divide along the anterior-posterior axis. Through Notch signaling, the P2 cell differentially specifies the ABp and ABa cells, which further defines the dorsal-ventral axis. The left-right axis also becomes apparent early in embryogenesis, although it is unclear exactly when specifically the axis is determined. However, most theories of the L-R axis development involve some kind of differences in cells derived from the AB cell.

==== Gastrulation ====
Gastrulation occurs after the embryo reaches the 24-cell stage. &quot;C. elegans&quot; are a species of protostomes, so the blastopore eventually forms the mouth. Involution into the blastopore begins with movement of the endoderm cells and subsequent formation of the gut, followed by the P4 germline precursor, and finally the mesoderm cells, including the cells that eventually form the pharynx. Gastrulation ends when epiboly of the hypoblasts closes the blastopore.

=== Post-embryonic development ===

Under environmental conditions favourable for reproduction, hatched larvae develop through four larval stages - L1, L2, L3, and L4 - in just 3 days at 20 °C. When conditions are stressed, as in food insufficiency, excessive population density or high temperature, &quot;C. elegans&quot; can enter an alternative third larval stage, L2d, called the dauer stage (&quot;Dauer&quot; is German for permanent). A specific dauer pheromone regulates entry into the dauer state. This pheromone is composed of similar derivatives of the 3,6-dideoxy sugar, ascarylose. Ascarosides, named after the ascarylose base, are involved in many sex-specific and social behaviors. In this way, they constitute a chemical language that &quot;C. elegans&quot; uses to modulate various phenotypes. Dauer larvae are stress-resistant; they are thin and their mouths are sealed with a characteristic dauer cuticle and cannot take in food. They can remain in this stage for a few months. The stage ends when conditions improve favour further growth of the larva, now moulting into the L4 stage, even though the gonad development is arrested at the L2 stage.

Each stage transition is punctuated by a molt of the worm&#x27;s transparent cuticle. Transitions through these stages are controlled by genes of the heterochronic pathway, an evolutionarily conserved set of regulatory factors. Many heterochronic genes code for microRNAs, which repress the expression of heterochronic transcription factors and other heterochronic miRNAs. miRNAs were originally discovered in &quot;C. elegans.&quot; Important developmental events controlled by heterochronic genes include the division and eventual syncitial fusion of the hypodermic seam cells, and their subsequent secretion of the alae in young adults. It is believed that the heterochronic pathway represents an evolutionarily conserved predecessor to circadian clocks.

Some nematodes have a fixed, genetically determined number of cells, a phenomenon known as eutely. The adult &quot;C. elegans&quot; hermaphrodite has 959 somatic cells and the male has 1033 cells, although it has been suggested that the number of their intestinal cells can increase by one to three in response to gut microbes experienced by mothers. Much of the literature describes the cell number in males as 1031, but the discovery of a pair of left and right MCM neurons increased the number by two in 2015. The number of cells does not change after cell division ceases at the end of the larval period, and subsequent growth is due solely to an increase in the size of individual cells.

== Ecology ==

The different &quot;Caenorhabditis&quot; species occupy various nutrient- and bacteria-rich environments. They feed on the bacteria that develop in decaying organic matter (microbivory). They possess chemosensory receptors which enable the detection of bacteria and bacterial-secreted metabolites (such as iron siderophores), so that they can migrate towards their bacterial prey. Soil lacks enough organic matter to support self-sustaining populations. &quot;C. elegans&quot; can survive on a diet of a variety of bacteria, but its wild ecology is largely unknown. Most laboratory strains were taken from artificial environments such as gardens and compost piles. More recently, &quot;C. elegans&quot; has been found to thrive in other kinds of organic matter, particularly rotting fruit.
&quot;C. elegans&quot; can also ingest pollutants, especially tiny nanoplastics, which could enable the association with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, resulting in the dissemination of nanoplastics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria by &quot;C. elegans&quot; across the soil. &quot;C. elegans&quot; can also use different species of yeast, including &quot;Cryptococcus laurentii&quot; and &quot;C. kuetzingii&quot;, as sole sources of food. Although a bacterivore, &quot;C. elegans&quot; can be killed by a number of pathogenic bacteria, including human pathogens such as &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; or &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;. Pathogenic bacteria can also form biofilms, whose sticky exopolymer matrix could impede &quot;C. elegans&quot; motility and cloaks bacterial quorum sensing chemoattractants from predator detection.

Invertebrates such as millipedes, insects, isopods, and gastropods can transport dauer larvae to various suitable locations. The larvae have also been seen to feed on their hosts when they die.
Nematodes can survive desiccation, and in &quot;C. elegans&quot;, the mechanism for this capability has been demonstrated to be late embryogenesis abundant proteins.
&quot;C. elegans&quot;, as other nematodes, can be eaten by predator nematodes and other omnivores, including some insects.

The Orsay virus is a virus that affects &quot;C. elegans&quot;, as well as the Caenorhabditis elegans Cer1 virus and the Caenorhabditis elegans Cer13 virus.

; Interactions with fungi
Wild isolates of &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; are regularly found with infections by Microsporidia fungi. One such species, &quot;Nematocida parisii&quot;, replicates in the intestines of &quot;C. elegans&quot;.

&quot;Arthrobotrys oligospora&quot; is the model organism for interactions between fungi and nematodes. It is the most common and widespread nematode capturing fungus.

== Use as a model organism ==
In 1963, Sydney Brenner proposed using &quot;C. elegans&quot; as a model organism for the investigation primarily of neural development in animals. It is one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system. The neurons do not fire action potentials, and do not express any voltage-gated sodium channels. In the hermaphrodite, this system comprises 302 neurons the pattern of which has been comprehensively mapped, in what is known as a connectome, and shown to be a small-world network.

Research has explored the neural and molecular mechanisms that control several behaviors of &quot;C. elegans&quot;, including chemotaxis, thermotaxis, mechanotransduction, learning, memory, and mating behaviour. In 2019 the connectome of the male was published using a technique distinct from that used for the hermaphrodite. The same paper used the new technique to redo the hermaphrodite connectome, finding 1,500 new synapses.

It has been used as a model organism to study molecular mechanisms in metabolic diseases. 
Brenner also chose it as it is easy to grow in bulk populations, and convenient for genetic analysis. It is a multicellular eukaryotic organism, yet simple enough to be studied in great detail. The transparency of &quot;C. elegans&quot; facilitates the study of cellular differentiation and other developmental processes in the intact organism. The spicules in the male clearly distinguish males from females. Strains are cheap to breed and can be frozen. When subsequently thawed, they remain viable, allowing long-term storage. Maintenance is easy when compared to other multicellular model organisms. A few hundred nematodes can be kept on a single agar plate and suitable growth medium. Brenner described the use of a mutant of &quot;E. coli&quot; – OP50. OP50 is a uracil-requiring organism and its deficiency in the plate prevents the overgrowth of bacteria which would obscure the worms. The use of OP50 does not demand any major laboratory safety measures, since it is non-pathogenic and easily grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) media overnight.

=== Cell lineage mapping ===
The developmental fate of every single somatic cell (959 in the adult hermaphrodite; 1031 in the adult male) has been mapped. These patterns of cell lineage are largely invariant between individuals, whereas in mammals, cell development is more dependent on cellular cues from the embryo.

As mentioned previously, the first cell divisions of early embryogenesis in &quot;C. elegans&quot; are among the best understood examples of asymmetric cell divisions, and the worm is a very popular model system for studying developmental biology.

=== Programmed cell death ===
Programmed cell death (apoptosis) eliminates many additional cells (131 in the hermaphrodite, most of which would otherwise become neurons); this &quot;apoptotic predictability&quot; has contributed to the elucidation of some apoptotic genes. Cell death-promoting genes and a single cell-death inhibitor have been identified.

=== RNA interference and gene silencing ===
RNA interference (RNAi) is a relatively straightforward method of disrupting the function of specific genes. Silencing the function of a gene can sometimes allow a researcher to infer its possible function. The nematode can be soaked in, injected with, or fed with genetically transformed bacteria that express the double-stranded RNA of interest, the sequence of which complements the sequence of the gene that the researcher wishes to disable.
RNAi has emerged as a powerful tool in the study of functional genomics. &quot;C. elegans&quot; has been used to analyse gene functions and claim the promise of future findings in the systematic genetic interactions.

Environmental RNAi uptake is much worse in other species of worms in the genus &quot;Caenorhabditis&quot;. Although injecting RNA into the body cavity of the animal induces gene silencing in most species, only &quot;C. elegans&quot; and a few other distantly related nematodes can take up RNA from the bacteria they eat for RNAi. This ability has been mapped down to a single gene, &quot;sid-2&quot;, which, when inserted as a transgene in other species, allows them to take up RNA for RNAi as &quot;C. elegans&quot; does.

=== Cell division and cell cycle ===
Research into meiosis has been considerably simplified since every germ cell nucleus is at the same given position as it moves down the gonad, so is at the same stage in meiosis. In an early phase of meiosis, the oocytes become extremely resistant to radiation and this resistance depends on expression of genes &quot;rad51&quot; and &quot;atm&quot; that have key roles in recombinational repair. Gene &quot;mre-11&quot; also plays a crucial role in recombinational repair of DNA damage during meiosis. Furthermore, during meiosis in &quot;C. elegans&quot; the tumor suppressor BRCA1/BRC-1 and the structural maintenance of chromosomes SMC5/SMC6 protein complex interact to promote high fidelity repair of DNA double-strand breaks.

A study of the frequency of outcrossing in natural populations showed that selfing is the predominant mode of reproduction in &quot;C. elegans&quot;, but that infrequent outcrossing events occur at a rate around 1%. Meioses that result in selfing are unlikely to contribute significantly to beneficial genetic variability, but these meioses may provide the adaptive benefit of recombinational repair of DNA damages that arise, especially under stressful conditions.

=== Drug abuse and addiction ===
Nicotine dependence can also be studied using &quot;C. elegans&quot; because it exhibits behavioral responses to nicotine that parallel those of mammals. These responses include acute response, tolerance, withdrawal, and sensitization.

=== Biological databases ===
As for most model organisms, scientists that work in the field curate a dedicated online database and WormBase is that for &quot;C. elegans&quot;. The WormBase attempts to collate all published information on &quot;C. elegans&quot; and other related nematodes. Information on &quot;C. elegans&quot; is included with data on other model organisms in the Alliance of Genome Resources.

=== Ageing ===
&quot;C. elegans&quot; has been a model organism for research into ageing; for example, the inhibition of an insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway has been shown to increase adult lifespan threefold; while glucose feeding promotes oxidative stress and reduces adult lifespan by a half. Similarly, induced degradation of an insulin/IGF-1 receptor late in life extended life expectancy of worms dramatically. 
Long-lived mutants of &quot;C. elegans&quot; were demonstrated to be resistant to oxidative stress and UV light. These long-lived mutants had a higher DNA repair capability than wild-type &quot;C. elegans&quot;. Knockdown of the nucleotide excision repair gene Xpa-1 increased sensitivity to UV and reduced the life span of the long-lived mutants. These findings indicate that DNA repair capability underlies longevity. Consistent with the idea that oxidative DNA damage causes aging, it was found that in &quot;C. elegans&quot;, exosome-mediated delivery of superoxide dismutase (SOD) reduces the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and significantly extends lifespan, i.e. delays aging under normal, as well as hostile conditions.

The capacity to repair DNA damage by the process of nucleotide excision repair declines with age.

&quot;C. elegans&quot; exposed to 5mM lithium chloride (LiCl) showed lengthened life spans. When exposed to 10μM LiCl, reduced mortality was observed, but not with 1μM.

&quot;C. elegans&quot; has been instrumental in the identification of the functions of genes implicated in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, such as presenilin. Moreover, extensive research on &quot;C. elegans&quot; has identified RNA-binding proteins as essential factors during germline and early embryonic development.

Telomeres, the length of which have been shown to correlate with increased lifespan and delayed onset of senescence in a multitude of organisms, from &quot;C. elegans&quot; to humans, show an interesting behaviour in &quot;C. elegans.&quot; While &quot;C. elegans&quot; maintains its telomeres in a canonical way similar to other eukaryotes, in contrast &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; is noteworthy in its use of retrotransposons to maintain its telomeres, during knock-out of the catalytic subunit of the telomerase (&quot;trt-1&quot;) &quot;C. elegans&quot; can gain the ability of alternative telomere lengthening (ALT). &quot;C. elegans&quot; was the first eukaryote to gain ALT functionality after knock-out of the canonical telomerase pathway. ALT is also observed in about 10-15% of all clinical cancers. Thus &quot;C. elegans&quot; is a prime candidate for ALT research. Bayat et al. showed the paradoxical shortening of telomeres during &quot;trt-1&quot; over-expression which lead to near sterility while the worms even exhibited a slight increase in lifespan, despite shortened telomeres.

=== Sleep ===
&quot;C. elegans&quot; is notable in animal sleep studies as the most primitive organism to display sleep-like states. In &quot;C. elegans&quot;, a lethargus phase occurs shortly before each moult. &quot;C. elegans&quot; has also been demonstrated to sleep after exposure to physical stress, including heat shock, UV radiation, and bacterial toxins.

=== Sensory biology ===
While the worm has no eyes, it has been found to be sensitive to light due to a third type of light-sensitive animal photoreceptor protein, LITE-1, which is 10 to 100 times more efficient at absorbing light than the other two types of photopigments (opsins and cryptochromes) found in the animal kingdom.

&quot;C. elegans&quot; is remarkably adept at tolerating acceleration. It can withstand 400,000 g&#x27;s, according to geneticists at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. In an experiment, 96% of them were still alive without adverse effects after an hour in an ultracentrifuge.

=== Drug library screening ===
Having a small size and short life cycle, C. elegans is one of the few organisms that can enable in vivo high throughput screening (HTS) platforms for the evaluation of chemical libraries of drugs and toxins in a multicellular organism. Orthologous phenotypes observable in C. elegans for human diseases have the potential to enable profiling of drug library profiling that can inform potential repurposing of existing approved drugs for therapeutic indications in humans.

=== Spaceflight research ===
&quot;C. elegans&quot; made news when specimens were discovered to have survived the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in February 2003. Later, in January 2009, live samples of &quot;C. elegans&quot; from the University of Nottingham were announced to be spending two weeks on the International Space Station that October, in a space research project to explore the effects of zero gravity on muscle development and physiology. The research was primarily about genetic basis of muscle atrophy, which relates to spaceflight or being bed-ridden, geriatric, or diabetic. Descendants of the worms aboard Columbia in 2003 were launched into space on &quot;Endeavour&quot; for the STS-134 mission. Additional experiments on muscle dystrophy during spaceflight were carried on board the ISS starting in 2018. It was shown that the genes affecting muscles attachment were expressed less in space. However, it has yet to be seen if this affects muscle strength.

== Genetics ==
=== Genome ===
&quot;C. elegans&quot; was the first multicellular organism to have its whole genome sequenced. The sequence was published in 1998, although some small gaps were present; the last gap was finished by October 2002. In the run up to the whole genome the &quot;C. elegans&quot; Sequencing Consortium/&quot;C. elegans&quot; Genome Project released several partial scans including Wilson et al. 1994.

====Size and gene content====
The &quot;C. elegans&quot; genome is about 100 million base pairs long and consists of six pairs of chromosomes in hermaphrodites or five pairs of autosomes with XO chromosome in male &quot;C. elegans&quot; and a mitochondrial genome. Its gene density is about one gene per five kilo-base pairs. Introns make up 26% and intergenic regions 47% of the genome. Many genes are arranged in clusters and how many of these are operons is unclear. &quot;C. elegans&quot; and other nematodes are among the few eukaryotes currently known to have operons; these include trypanosomes, flatworms (notably the trematode &quot;Schistosoma mansoni&quot;), and a primitive chordate tunicate &quot;Oikopleura dioica&quot;. Many more organisms are likely to be shown to have these operons.

The genome contains an estimated 20,470 protein-coding genes. About 35% of &quot;C. elegans&quot; genes have human homologs. Remarkably, human genes have been shown repeatedly to replace their &quot;C. elegans&quot; homologs when introduced into &quot;C. elegans&quot;. Conversely, many &quot;C. elegans&quot; genes can function similarly to mammalian genes.

The number of known RNA genes in the genome has increased greatly due to the 2006 discovery of a new class called &quot;21U-RNA&quot; genes, and the genome is now believed to contain more than 16,000 RNA genes, up from as few as 1,300 in 2005.

Scientific curators continue to appraise the set of known genes; new gene models continue to be added and incorrect ones modified or removed.

The reference &quot;C. elegans&quot; genome sequence continues to change as new evidence reveals errors in the original sequencing. Most changes are minor, adding or removing only a few base pairs of DNA. For example, the WS202 release of WormBase (April 2009) added two base pairs to the genome sequence. Sometimes, more extensive changes are made as noted in the WS197 release of December 2008, which added a region of over 4,300 bp to the sequence.

The &quot;C. elegans&quot; Genome Project&#x27;s Wilson et al. 1994 found CelVav and a von Willebrand factor A domain and with Wilson et al. 1998 provides the first credible evidence for an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) homolog outside of vertebrates. 2

====Related genomes====
In 2003, the genome sequence of the related nematode &quot;C. briggsae&quot; was also determined, allowing researchers to study the comparative genomics of these two organisms. The genome sequences of more nematodes from the same genus e.g., &quot;C. remanei&quot;, &quot;C. japonica&quot; and &quot;C. brenneri&quot; (named after Brenner), have also been studied using the shotgun sequencing technique. These sequences have now been completed.

=== Other genetic studies ===

As of 2014, &quot;C. elegans&quot; is the most basal species in the &#x27;Elegans&#x27; group (10 species) of the &#x27;Elegans&#x27; supergroup (17 species) in phylogenetic studies. It forms a branch of its own distinct to any other species of the group.

Tc1 transposon is a DNA transposon active in &quot;C. elegans&quot;.

== Scientific community ==
Several scientists have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for scientific discoveries made working with &quot;C. elegans&quot;. It was awarded in 2002 to Sydney Brenner, H. Robert Horvitz, and John Sulston for their work on the genetics of organ development and programmed cell death, in 2006 to Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello for their discovery of RNA interference, and in 2024 to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation.
In 2008, Martin Chalfie shared a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on green fluorescent protein; some of the research involved the use of &quot;C. elegans&quot;.

Many scientists who research &quot;C. elegans &quot;closely connect to Sydney Brenner, with whom almost all research in this field began in the 1970s; they have worked as either a postdoctoral or a postgraduate researcher in Brenner&#x27;s lab or in the lab of someone who previously worked with Brenner. Most who worked in his lab later established their own worm research labs, thereby creating a fairly well-documented &quot;lineage&quot; of &quot;C. elegans&quot; scientists, which was recorded into the WormBase database in some detail at the 2003 International Worm Meeting.

<text>Xenopus () (Gk., ξενος, &quot;xenos&quot; = strange, πους, &quot;pous&quot; = foot, commonly known as the clawed frog) is a genus of highly aquatic frogs native to sub-Saharan Africa. Twenty species are currently described within it. The two best-known species of this genus are &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; and &quot;Xenopus tropicalis&quot;, which are commonly studied as model organisms for developmental biology, cell biology, toxicology, neuroscience and for modelling human disease and birth defects.

The genus is also known for its polyploidy, with some species having up to 12 sets of chromosomes.

==Characteristics==

&quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; is a rather inactive creature. It is incredibly hardy and can live up to 15 years. At times the ponds that &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; is found in dry up, compelling it, in the dry season, to burrow into the mud, leaving a tunnel for air. It may lie dormant for up to a year. If the pond dries up in the rainy season, &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; may migrate long distances to another pond, maintaining hydration by the rains. It is an adept swimmer, swimming in all directions with ease. It is barely able to hop, but it is able to crawl. It spends most of its time underwater and comes to surface to breathe. Respiration is predominantly through its well-developed lungs; there is little cutaneous respiration.

===Description===

All species of &quot;Xenopus&quot; have flattened, somewhat egg-shaped and streamlined bodies, and very slippery skin (because of a protective mucus covering). The frog&#x27;s skin is smooth, but with a lateral line sensory organ that has a stitch-like appearance. The frogs are all excellent swimmers and have powerful, fully webbed toes, though the fingers lack webbing. Three of the toes on each foot have conspicuous black claws.
The frog&#x27;s eyes are on top of the head, looking upwards. The pupils are circular. They have no moveable eyelids, tongues (rather it is completely attached to the floor of the mouth) or eardrums (similarly to &quot;Pipa pipa&quot;, the common Suriname toad).
Unlike most amphibians, they have no haptoglobin in their blood.

===Behaviour===
&quot;Xenopus&quot; species are entirely aquatic, though they have been observed migrating on land to nearby bodies of water during times of drought or in heavy rain. They are usually found in lakes, rivers, swamps, potholes in streams, and man-made reservoirs.

Adult frogs are usually both predators and scavengers, and since their tongues are unusable, the frogs use their small fore limbs to aid in the feeding process. Since they also lack vocal sacs, they make clicks (brief pulses of sound) underwater (again similar to &quot;Pipa pipa&quot;). Males establish a hierarchy of social dominance in which primarily one male has the right to make the advertisement call. The females of many species produce a release call, and &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; females produce an additional call when sexually receptive and soon to lay eggs. The &quot;Xenopus&quot; species are also active during the twilight (or crepuscular) hours.

During breeding season, the males develop ridge-like nuptial pads (black in color) on their fingers to aid in grasping the female. The frogs&#x27; mating embrace is inguinal, meaning the male grasps the female around her waist.

== Model organism for biological research ==
Like many other frogs, they are often used in laboratory as research subjects. &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos and eggs are a popular model system for a wide variety of biological studies. This animal is used because of its powerful combination of experimental tractability and close evolutionary relationship with humans, at least compared to many model organisms.

&quot;Xenopus&quot; has long been an important tool for &quot;in vivo studies&quot; in molecular, cell, and developmental biology of vertebrate animals. However, the wide breadth of &quot;Xenopus&quot; research stems from the additional fact that cell-free extracts made from &quot;Xenopus&quot; are a premier &quot;in vitro &quot;system for studies of fundamental aspects of cell and molecular biology. Thus, &quot;Xenopus&quot; is a vertebrate model system that allows for high-throughput &quot;in vivo&quot; analyses of gene function and high-throughput biochemistry. Furthermore, &quot;Xenopus&quot; oocytes are a leading system for studies of ion transport and channel physiology. &quot;Xenopus&quot; is also a unique system for analyses of genome evolution and whole genome duplication in vertebrates, as different &quot;Xenopus&quot; species form a ploidy series formed by interspecific hybridization.

In 1931, Lancelot Hogben noted that &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; females ovulated when injected with the urine of pregnant women. This led to a pregnancy test that was later refined by South African researchers Hillel Abbe Shapiro and Harry Zwarenstein. A female Xenopus frog injected with a woman&#x27;s urine was put in a jar with a little water. If eggs were in the water a day later it meant the woman was pregnant. Four years after the first &quot;Xenopus&quot; test, Zwarenstein&#x27;s colleague, Dr Louis Bosman, reported that the test was accurate in more than 99% of cases. From the 1930s to the 1950s, thousands of frogs were exported across the world for use in these pregnancy tests.

The of the Marine Biological Laboratory is an &quot;in vivo&quot; repository for transgenic and mutant strains and a training center.

=== Online Model Organism Database ===
Xenbase is the Model Organism Database (MOD) for both &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; and &quot;Xenopus tropicalis&quot;.

=== Investigation of human disease genes ===

All modes of &quot;Xenopus&quot; research (embryos, cell-free extracts, and oocytes) are commonly used in direct studies of human disease genes and to study the basic science underlying initiation and progression of cancer. &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos for &quot;in vivo&quot; studies of human disease gene function: &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos are large and easily manipulated, and moreover, thousands of embryos can be obtained in a single day. Indeed, &quot;Xenopus&quot; was the first vertebrate animal for which methods were developed to allow rapid analysis of gene function using misexpression (by mRNA injection). Injection of mRNA in &quot;Xenopus&quot; that led to the cloning of interferon. Moreover, the use of morpholino-antisense oligonucleotides for gene knockdowns in vertebrate embryos, which is now widely used, was first developed by Janet Heasman using &quot;Xenopus&quot;.

In recent years, these approaches have played in important role in studies of human disease genes. The mechanism of action for several genes mutated in human cystic kidney disorders (e.g. nephronophthisis) have been extensively studied in &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos, shedding new light on the link between these disorders, ciliogenesis and Wnt signaling. &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos have also provided a rapid test bed for validating newly discovered disease genes. For example, studies in &quot;Xenopus&quot; confirmed and elucidated the role of &quot;PYCR1&quot; in cutis laxa with progeroid features.

Transgenic &quot;Xenopus&quot; for studying transcriptional regulation of human disease genes: &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos develop rapidly, so transgenesis in &quot;Xenopus&quot; is a rapid and effective method for analyzing genomic regulatory sequences. In a recent study, mutations in the &quot;SMAD7&quot; locus were revealed to associate with human colorectal cancer. The mutations lay in conserved, but noncoding sequences, suggesting these mutations impacted the patterns of &quot;SMAD7&quot; transcription. To test this hypothesis, the authors used &quot;Xenopus&quot; transgenesis, and revealed this genomic region drove expression of GFP in the hindgut. Moreover, transgenics made with the mutant version of this region displayed substantially less expression in the hindgut.

&quot;Xenopus&quot; cell-free extracts for biochemical studies of proteins encoded by human disease genes: A unique advantage of the &quot;Xenopus&quot; system is that cytosolic extracts contain both soluble cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (including chromatin proteins). This is in contrast to cellular extracts prepared from somatic cells with already distinct cellular compartments. &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts have provided numerous insights into the basic biology of cells with particular impact on cell division and the DNA transactions associated with it (see below).

Studies in &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts have also yielded critical insights into the mechanism of action of human disease genes associated with genetic instability and elevated cancer risk, such as ataxia telangiectasia, &quot;BRCA1&quot; inherited breast and ovarian cancer, &quot;Nbs1&quot; Nijmegen breakage syndrome, &quot;RecQL4&quot; Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, &quot;c-Myc&quot; oncogene and FANC proteins (Fanconi anemia).

&quot;Xenopus&quot; oocytes for studies of gene expression and channel activity related to human disease: Yet another strength of &quot;Xenopus&quot; is the ability to rapidly and easily assay the activity of channel and transporter proteins using expression in oocytes. This application has also led to important insights into human disease, including studies related to trypanosome transmission, Epilepsy with ataxia and sensorineural deafness Catastrophic cardiac arrhythmia (Long-QT syndrome) and Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy.

Gene editing by the CRISPR/CAS system has recently been demonstrated in &quot;Xenopus&quot; &quot;tropicalis&quot; and &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;. This technique is being used to screen the effects of human disease genes in &quot;Xenopus&quot; and the system is sufficiently efficient to study the effects within the same embryos that have been manipulated.

=== Investigation of fundamental biological processes ===

Signal transduction: &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos and cell-free extracts are widely used for basic research in signal transduction. In just the last few years, &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos have provided crucial insights into the mechanisms of TGF-beta and Wnt signal transduction. For example, &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos were used to identify the enzymes that control ubiquitination of Smad4, and to demonstrate direct links between TGF-beta superfamily signaling pathways and other important networks, such as the MAP kinase pathway and the Wnt pathway. Moreover, new methods using egg extracts revealed novel, important targets of the Wnt/GSK3 destruction complex.

Cell division: &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts have allowed the study of many complicated cellular events &quot;in vitro&quot;. Because egg cytosol can support successive cycling between mitosis and interphase &quot;in vitro&quot;, it has been critical to diverse studies of cell division. For example, the small GTPase Ran was first found to regulate interphase nuclear transport, but &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts revealed the critical role of Ran GTPase in mitosis independent of its role in interphase nuclear transport. Similarly, the cell-free extracts were used to model nuclear envelope assembly from chromatin, revealing the function of RanGTPase in regulating nuclear envelope reassembly after mitosis. More recently, using &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts, it was possible to demonstrate the mitosis-specific function of the nuclear lamin B in regulating spindle morphogenesis and to identify new proteins that mediate kinetochore attachment to microtubules. Cell-free systems have recently become practical investigatory tools, and &quot;Xenopus&quot; oocytes are often the source of the extracts used. This has produced significant results in understanding mitotic oscillation and microtubules.

Embryonic development: &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos are widely used in developmental biology. A summary of recent advances made by &quot;Xenopus&quot; research in recent years would include:

#Epigenetics of cell fate specification and epigenome reference maps
#microRNA in germ layer patterning and eye development
#Link between Wnt signaling and telomerase
#Development of the vasculature
#Gut morphogenesis
#Contact inhibition and neural crest cell migration and the generation of neural crest from pluripotent blastula cells
# - Role of &quot;Notch&quot;: Dorsky et al 1995 elucidated a pattern of expression followed by downregulation

DNA replication: &quot;Xenopus&quot; cell-free extracts also support the synchronous assembly and the activation of origins of DNA replication. They have been instrumental in characterizing the biochemical function of the prereplicative complex, including MCM proteins.

DNA damage response: Cell-free extracts have been instrumental to unravel the signaling pathways activated in response to DNA double-strand breaks (ATM), replication fork stalling (ATR) or DNA interstrand crosslinks (FA proteins and ATR). Notably, several mechanisms and components of these signal transduction pathways were first identified in &quot;Xenopus&quot;.

Apoptosis: &quot;Xenopus&quot; oocytes provide a tractable model for biochemical studies of apoptosis. Recently, oocytes were used recently to study the biochemical mechanisms of caspase-2 activation; importantly, this mechanism turns out to be conserved in mammals.

Regenerative medicine: In recent years, tremendous interest in developmental biology has been stoked by the promise of regenerative medicine. &quot;Xenopus&quot; has played a role here, as well. For example, expression of seven transcription factors in pluripotent &quot;Xenopus&quot; cells rendered those cells able to develop into functional eyes when implanted into &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos, providing potential insights into the repair of retinal degeneration or damage. In a vastly different study, &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos was used to study the effects of tissue tension on morphogenesis, an issue that will be critical for &quot;in vitro&quot; tissue engineering. &quot;Xenopus&quot; species are important model organisms for the study of spinal cord regeneration, because while capable of regeneration in their larval stages, &quot;Xenopus&quot; lose this capacity in early metamorphosis.

Physiology: The directional beating of multiciliated cells is essential to development and homeostasis in the central nervous system, the airway, and the oviduct. The multiciliated cells of the &quot;Xenopus&quot; epidermis have recently been developed as the first &quot;in vivo&quot; test-bed for live-cell studies of such ciliated tissues, and these studies have provided important insights into the biomechanical and molecular control of directional beating.

Actin: Another result from cell-free &quot;Xenopus&quot; oocyte extracts has been improved understanding of actin.

=== Small molecule screens to develop novel therapies ===

Because huge amounts of material are easily obtained, all modalities of &quot;Xenopus&quot; research are now being used for small-molecule based screens.

Chemical genetics of vascular growth in &quot;Xenopus&quot; tadpoles: Given the important role of neovascularization in cancer progression, &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos were recently used to identify new small molecules inhibitors of blood vessel growth. Notably, compounds identified in &quot;Xenopus&quot; were effective in mice. Notably, frog embryos figured prominently in a study that used evolutionary principles to identify a novel vascular disrupting agent that may have chemotherapeutic potential. That work was featured in the New York Times Science Times

&quot;In vivo&quot; testing of potential endocrine disruptors in transgenic &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos; A high-throughput assay for thyroid disruption has recently been developed using transgenic &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos.

Small molecule screens in &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts: Egg extracts provide ready analysis of molecular biological processes and can rapidly screened. This approach was used to identify novel inhibitors of proteasome-mediated protein degradation and DNA repair enzymes.

=== Genetic studies ===

While &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; is the most commonly used species for developmental biology studies, genetic studies, especially forward genetic studies, can be complicated by their pseudotetraploid genome. &quot;Xenopus tropicalis&quot; provides a simpler model for genetic studies, having a diploid genome.

=== Gene expression knockdown techniques ===
The expression of genes can be reduced by a variety of means, for example by using antisense oligonucleotides targeting specific mRNA molecules. DNA oligonucleotides complementary to specific mRNA molecules are often chemically modified to improve their stability &quot;in vivo&quot;. The chemical modifications used for this purpose include phosphorothioate, 2&#x27;-O-methyl, morpholino, MEA phosphoramidate and DEED phosphoramidate.

==== Morpholino oligonucleotides ====
Morpholino oligos are used in both &quot;X. laevis&quot; and &quot;X. tropicalis&quot; to probe the function of a protein by observing the results of eliminating the protein&#x27;s activity. For example, a set of &quot;X. tropicalis&quot; genes has been screened in this fashion.

Morpholino oligos (MOs) are short, antisense oligos made of modified nucleotides. MOs can knock down gene expression by inhibiting mRNA translation, blocking RNA splicing, or inhibiting miRNA activity and maturation. MOs have proven to be effective knockdown tools in developmental biology experiments and RNA-blocking reagents for cells in culture. MOs do not degrade their RNA targets, but instead act via a steric blocking mechanism RNAseH-independent manner. They remain stable in cells and do not induce immune responses. Microinjection of MOs in early &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos can suppress gene expression in a targeted manner.

Like all antisense approaches, different MOs can have different efficacy, and may cause off-target, non-specific effects. Often, several MOs need to be tested to find an effective target sequence. Rigorous controls are used to demonstrate specificity, including:
* Phenocopy of genetic mutation
* Verification of reduced protein by western or immunostaining
* mRNA rescue by adding back a mRNA immune to the MO
* use of 2 different MOs (translation blocking and splice blocking) 
* injection of control MOs
Xenbase provides a searchable catalog of over 2000 MOs that have been specifically used in Xenopus&quot; research.&quot; The data is searchable via sequence, gene symbol and various synonyms (as used in different publications). Xenbase maps the MOs to the latest &quot;Xenopus&quot; genomes in GBrowse, predicts &#x27;off-target&#x27; hits, and lists all &quot;Xenopus&quot; literature in which the morpholino has been published.

<text>Mission San Xavier del Bac () is a historic Spanish Catholic mission located about south of downtown Tucson, Arizona, on the Tohono O&#x27;odham Nation San Xavier Indian Reservation. The mission was founded in 1692 by Padre Eusebio Kino in the center of a centuries-old settlement of the Sobaipuri O&#x27;odham, a branch of the Akimel or River O&#x27;odham located along the banks of the Santa Cruz River. The mission was named for Francis Xavier, a Christian missionary and co-founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuit Order) in Europe. The original church was built to the north of the present Franciscan church. This northern church or churches served the mission until it was razed during an Apache raid in 1770.

The mission that survives today was built between 1783 and 1797, which makes it the oldest European structure in Arizona. Labor was provided by the O&#x27;odham. An outstanding example of Spanish Colonial architecture in the United States, the Mission San Xavier del Bac hosts some 200,000 visitors each year. It is a well-known pilgrimage site, with thousands visiting each year on foot and on horseback, some among ceremonial cavalcades or &quot;cabalgatas&quot;.

The site is also known as &quot;Wa:k&quot; in the O&#x27;odham language (&quot;&quot; (&quot;Water Place&quot;) referring to its surface water and springs, which no longer flow. The water in the Santa Cruz River came up to the surface a few miles south of Martinez Hill and then submerged again near Los Reales Wash. The Santa Cruz River used to run year-round in this section and was once critical to the community&#x27;s survival, but now runs only part of the year.

==History==


Mission San Xavier del Bac was established in 1692 by Eusebio Francisco Kino, who founded a chain of Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert. A Jesuit of Italian descent, Kino often visited and preached in the area, then the Pimería Alta colonial territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Construction of the first mission church, about from the site of today&#x27;s mission, began on April 28, 1700, as noted in his diary:

On the twenty-eighth we began the foundations of a very large and capacious church and house of San Xavier del Bac, all of the many people working with much pleasure and zeal, some in digging for the foundations, others in hauling many and very good stones of tezontle from a little hill which was about a quarter of a league away. ... On the twenty-ninth we continued laying the foundations of the church and of the house.

The &quot;little hill&quot; is believed to be that southeast of San Xavier del Bac. The location was vulnerable to Apache raids, and construction was interrupted until 1756, when it resumed under Alonso Ignacio Benito Espinosa. By 1763 the building was sufficiently complete that the missionaries could hold services inside it, although a poorly prepared foundation led to architectural issues.

In 1767, Charles III of Spain banned Jesuits from Spanish lands in the Americas; he installed Franciscans, whom he considered more pliable and &quot;reliable&quot;, as replacements. Francisco Garcés was assigned to San Xavier del Bac, where he remained until 1778. By 1770, the continuing Apache raids finally destroyed the original church. From 1775 on, the mission community and its Indigenous converts were protected somewhat from Apache raids by the Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón, established roughly downstream on the Santa Cruz River.

The present mission building was constructed under the direction of Franciscan fathers Juan Bautista Velderrain and Juan Bautista Llorenz between 1783 and 1797. With 7,000 pesos borrowed from a Sonoran rancher, they hired architect Ignacio Gaona, who employed a large workforce of O&#x27;odham to create today&#x27;s church.

Following Mexican independence in 1821, what was then known as Alta California was administered from Mexico City. In 1822, the mission was included under the jurisdiction of the Catholic Diocese of Sonora. In 1828, the Mexican government banned all Spanish-born priests, with the last resident Franciscan departing San Xavier for Spain in 1837.

Left vacant, the mission began to decay. Concerned about their church, local O&#x27;odham began to preserve what they could. In 1852, John Russell Bartlett visited the mission, writing:
With the Gadsden Purchase in 1853, the site of San Xavier became a part of the United States and the new Territory of Arizona. The church was re-opened in 1859 when the Santa Fe Diocese added the mission to its jurisdiction. It ordered repairs paid for with diocesan money, and assigned a priest to serve the community. In 1868 the Diocese of Tucson was established. It provided for regular services to be held again at the church.

In 1872, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet opened a school at the mission for the Tohono O&#x27;odham children. In 1895, a grant of $1,000 was given to repair the building. More classrooms were added in 1900. The Franciscans returned to the mission in 1913. In 1947, they built a new school next to the church for the local children.

== Missionaries ==

Like most missions in New Spain, San Xavier was manned by Jesuits until their 1767 expulsion from Mexico; afterwards, they were replaced by Franciscans.

==Renovation==

Extensive restoration that began in 1992 and was continuing as of 2021 has returned the mission interior to its historic splendor. Cement-based stucco added in the 1980s had trapped water inside the church and damaged its interior decorations. It is being removed and replaced with traditional mud plaster incorporating pulp from the prickly pear cactus. This material &quot;breathes&quot; better and allows excess water to escape, but it requires more frequent inspection and has higher maintenance costs. Following extensive and ongoing restoration of decorations, the mission church interior appears much in its original state, with brilliant colors and complex designs.

==Architecture==

San Xavier has an elegant white stucco, Moorish-inspired exterior, with an ornately decorated entrance. Visitors entering the massive, carved mesquite-wood doors are often struck both by the coolness of the interior and the dazzling colors of the paintings, carvings, frescoes, and statues. The architecture is entirely European, with no Piman influence on its Baroque style.

The floor plan of the church resembles the classic Latin cross, with a main aisle separated from the sanctuary by the transept, which has chapels at either end. The dome above the transept is high, supported by arches and squinches. At least three different artists painted the artwork inside the church. It is considered by many to be the finest example of Spanish mission architecture in the United States.

==Mission today==
Unlike the other Spanish missions in Arizona, San Xavier is still actively run by Franciscans, and continues to serve the native community by which it was built. Widely considered to be the finest example of Spanish Colonial architecture in the United States, the Mission hosts some 200,000 visitors each year. It is open to the public daily, except when being used for church services. The Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity, who have taught at the school since 1872, continue with their work and reside in the mission convent. It has a mausoleum which is open for visiting.
The mission makes a cameo appearance in Willa Cather&#x27;s 1927 novel &quot;Death Comes for the Archbishop&quot; when it is described by Vaillant as &quot;the most beautiful church on the continent, though it had been neglected for more than two hundred years.&quot;

Mission San Xavier del Bac was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The San Xavier Festival is held the evening of the Friday after Easter and features a torch-light parade of Tohono O&#x27;odham and Yaqui tribal members.

==Nearby communities==

===Martinez Hill===

To the east of the San Xavier Mission, abutting the I-19 Freeway, is Martinez Hill. This hill, according to historian David Leighton, is named in honor of Jose Maria Martinez. Mr. Martinez was born in the Pimería Alta (present-day northern Sonora and southern Arizona), in the early 1800s. Around 1833, Jose wed Felipa Yrigoyen, likely in Tubac, Sonora. The couple had many children, including Maria and Nicolas Martinez. From 1836 to 1838, Lt. Col. Jose Maria Martinez was in charge of the presidio in Tucson. In 1838, he retired from the military and was given land in Tubac. Ten years later, an attack by the Apache forced the residents to abandon the town, with most moving to Tucson, but the Martinez family relocated to San Xavier, where he was granted land by the chief. The hill that bears his name was either included in the land grant or was very close to it. Martinez went into the cattle business for many years and died from wounds suffered in an Apache attack in 1868.

===Los Reales===

To the north of San Xavier Mission existed the Los Reales community. The community (sometimes referred to as a town or village) is believed to have existed from about the early 1860s to about 1912, but had long been forgotten until an article in the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot; by historian David Leighton brought it to light. The community was started when a miner named S.R. Domingo built a home and foundry just north of the San Xavier Mission, on the west bank of the Santa Cruz River. He prospered in his mining endeavor and is believed to have kept his wealth buried in the tall grasses along the river, since no banks existed at the time. In time, other individuals came to the area and began farms in the fertile valley supported by the ever-flowing river, and the community grew. They built adobe homes, planted crops, and established the first Los Reales community. Domingo is believed to have been murdered in the late 1860s by miners he had hired to work his mine, but it is unknown what happened to his riches.

In 1874, President Ulysses S. Grant established the San Xavier Indian Reservation and all non-Native Americans were required to leave Indigenous lands. These individuals set up the new or second Los Reales on the east bank of the river. This new community across from the old Los Reales included two stores and a blacksmith shop nearby. The Los Reales Cemetery also existed on that side of the river. It is believed that in 1912, as a result of the Midvale Farms (now the Midvale Park neighborhood) taking much of the water from the river, the farming village ceased to exist. The only known remnants of the old town are parts of the cemetery and a street known as Los Reales Road.

===In popular media===
The exterior of the Mission was used in the 1979 TV mini-series &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, as an establishing shot taken for a fictitious church in Guatemala.

<doc id="57550" wikidata="Q312581" url="?curid=57550" title="Charles Edward Stuart">
<text>Charles Edward Louis John Sylvester Maria Casimir Stuart (31 December 1720 – 30 January 1788) was the elder son of James Francis Edward Stuart, making him the grandson of James VII and II, and the Stuart claimant to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1766 as Charles III. During his lifetime, he was also known as &quot;the Young Pretender&quot; and &quot;the Young Chevalier&quot;; in popular memory, he is known as Bonnie Prince Charlie.

Born in Rome to the exiled Stuart court, he spent much of his early and later life in Italy. In 1744, he travelled to France to take part in a planned invasion to restore the Stuart monarchy under his father. When storms partly wrecked the French fleet, Charles resolved to proceed to Scotland following discussion with leading Jacobites. This resulted in Charles landing by ship on the west coast of Scotland, leading to the Jacobite rising of 1745. The Jacobite forces under Charles initially achieved several victories in the field, including the Battle of Prestonpans in September 1745 and the Battle of Falkirk Muir in January 1746. However, by April 1746, Charles was defeated at Culloden, effectively ending the Stuart cause. Although there were subsequent attempts such as a planned French invasion in 1759, Charles was unable to restore the Stuart monarchy.

With the Jacobite cause lost, Charles spent the remainder of his life on the continent, except for one secret visit to London. On his return, Charles lived briefly in France before he was exiled in 1748 under the terms of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Charles eventually returned to Italy, where he spent much of his later life living in Florence and Rome. He had a number of mistresses before marrying Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern in 1772. In his later life, Charles&#x27;s health declined greatly, and he was said to be an alcoholic. However, his escapades during the 1745 and 1746 uprisings and his escape from Scotland led to his portrayal as a romantic figure of heroic failure. His life and the once possible prospects of a restored Stuart monarchy have left an enduring historical legend that continues to have a legacy today.

==Early life==
===Childhood and education: 1720–1734===

Charles was born in the Palazzo Muti in Rome, Italy, on 31 December 1720, where his father had been given a residence by Pope Clement XI. Historians differ as to who carried out his baptism ceremony. Kybett reports that it was presided over by Pope Clement, whereas Douglas and Pininski state it was carried out by the Bishop of Montefiascone. Regardless, he was given the names Charles for his great-grandfather, Edward after Edward the Confessor, Louis for the King of France, Casimir after the kings of Poland, and Sylvester as he was born on Saint Sylvester&#x27;s Day.

Charles was the son of the Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart (himself son of the exiled Stuart King James II and VII), and Maria Clementina Sobieska, a Polish noblewoman (the granddaughter of John III Sobieski). Charles Edward&#x27;s grandfather, James II of England and Ireland and VII of Scotland, ruled the kingdoms from 1685 to 1688. He was deposed when the English Parliament invited the Dutch Protestant William III and his wife, Princess Mary, King James&#x27;s eldest daughter, to replace him in the Revolution of 1688. Many Protestants, including a number of prominent parliamentarians, had been worried that King James aimed to return England fully to the Catholic faith. Since the exile of James and the Act of Settlement, the &quot;Jacobite Cause&quot; had striven to return the Stuarts to the thrones of England and Scotland, which had been united in 1603 under James VI and I, with the parliaments joined by the Acts of Union in 1707 as the Kingdom of Great Britain.

Charles was said to have suffered from weak legs at an early age, possibly as a result of rickets. However, Charles was instructed in a regime of exercise and dancing to help improve his constitution, which strengthened his legs by later years. Charles spent much of his early childhood in Rome and Bologna in the company of a small retinue and a close but often argumentative family. His brother Henry Benedict Stuart was born 5 years later on 6 March 1725. His mother and father were regularly at disagreement with each other, leading to one notable incident in which Clementina left the palace shortly after Henry&#x27;s birth in 1725 and moved to a convent, not returning until 1727. As the legitimate heirs to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland—according to the Jacobite succession, James and his household lived with a sense of pride, and staunchly believed in the divine right of kings. Charles spent much of his early years in the company of older men, several of whom acted as his tutors. Charles Edward&#x27;s governor was the Protestant James Murray, Jacobite Earl of Dunbar. While the Pope had raised initial concerns over Charles&#x27;s religious education under a Protestant governor, James agreed that Charles would be raised as a Catholic. Among his tutors were the Chevalier Ramsay, Sir Thomas Sheridan and Father Vinceguerra, a Catholic priest. He quickly became conversant in English, French and Italian, although it was said that he never fully mastered any language and was partially illiterate. During his childhood, he was reported to enjoy hunting, horsemanship, a form of golf, music and dancing.

===Travels in Europe: 1734–1745===

In 1734, his cousin, the Duke of Liria, who was proceeding to join Don Carlos in his struggle for the crown of Naples, passed through Rome. He offered to take Charles on his expedition, and the boy of thirteen was appointed general of artillery by Don Carlos. On 30 July 1734, he departed Rome with an escort and proceeded with his cousin to the French and Spanish siege of Gaeta, his first exposure to war. While at Gaeta, he observed the final stages of the siege and was said to have come under fire in the trenches of the siegeworks. He returned to Rome in late 1734. In January 1735, shortly after his fourteenth birthday, Charles&#x27;s mother Clementina died of scurvy. She had been in a poor state of declining health for many months; however, Charles was said to have been deeply distressed after his mother passed.

As Charles grew older, he was introduced by his father and the Pope to Italian society. In 1737, James sent his son on a tour through major Italian cities to complete his education as a prince and man of the world. Charles proceeded to visit Genoa, Florence, Parma, Bologna and Venice. The Italian tour was a shock for Charles, who had believed he would be welcomed as a royal prince. Instead, most European courts would only receive him as the &quot;Duke of Albany&quot; (an historic title adopted by Scottish royals in the 14th century). Despite being Catholic, many European states wished to avoid antagonising Britain, the only exception being Venice.

By the time he had reached 20, he had become a notable member of upper-class society in Rome and had developed a fondness for alcohol and fine clothes, often in excess of his allowance. He had become increasingly distant from his brother due to Henry&#x27;s devotion to prayer and religious study. His father continued to rely on foreign aid in his attempts to restore himself to the British and Irish thrones. However, Charles became increasingly supportive of the idea of rebellion unassisted by invasion or by support of any kind from abroad. On 23 December 1743, owing to his limited ability to travel to Britain, James named his son Charles prince regent, giving him the authority to act in his name.

In January 1744, his father believed he had managed to obtain the de facto renewed support of the French government. Following this mistaken belief, Charles Edward travelled covertly to France from Rome, initially under the guise of a hunting party. However, neither the French Government nor King Louis XV had officially invited Charles. Nevertheless, by February, the French government had agreed to support a planned invasion of England, hoping to remove British forces from the War of the Austrian Succession. Charles then travelled to Dunkirk with the purpose of accompanying a French Army across to England. The invasion never materialised, as the French fleet was scattered by a storm in the spring equinox, losing 11 ships. By the time it regrouped, the British fleet realised the diversion that had deceived them and resumed their position in the Channel.

After the failure of the planned invasion, Charles remained in France, staying at several places, including Gravelines, Chantilly and Paris, leasing a hilltop house in Montmartre in May 1744. Owing to his expenditure on his wardrobe, attendants and drinking, Charles became in debt to the amount of 30,000 livres. With news of this and following the failed invasion, the French attempted to encourage Charles to return to Italy by refusing to pay him a monthly subsidy. However, when he could no longer afford the rent on the house in Montmartre, the Archbishop of Cambrai agreed to lend him his country estate near Paris where he stayed until January 1745. Charles then moved to the country house of Anne, Duchess of Berwick in Soissons, following repeated attempts by the French to encourage him to leave the Paris region. However, Charles continued to travel regularly to Paris during this period, often incognito and frequenting the hotels of the city to meet with supporters.

==1745 uprising==
===Preparations and journey to Scotland: 1745===

In both Rome and Paris, Charles met numerous supporters of the Stuart cause; he knew that Jacobite representatives were in every key European court. He had now taken a considerable share in correspondence and other work promoting his and his father&#x27;s interests. While in Paris and Soissons, Charles sought funding and support to restore the monarchy. Following conversations with Irish and Scottish exiles such as Sir Thomas Sheridan who assured him of the strength of the Jacobite movement in Scotland, as well as following receipt of a petition to Charles from Sir Hector Maclean on behalf of intervention, Charles resolved to launch an expedition to Scotland. The ultimate aim was to instigate a rebellion that would place his father on the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. To assist with funding the expedition, Charles borrowed some 180,000 livres from the Paris bankers John Waters and George Waters. Part of these funds had been raised through support from loyalists in Britain such as Sir Henry Bedingfield of Oxburgh Hall. As security for the loans, Charles was able to use the Sobieski crown jewels of his great-grandfather John III Sobieski, which had passed down to him through his mother. He used these extensive funds to purchase weapons and fit out the &quot;Elisabeth&quot;, an old man-of-war of 66 guns, and the &quot;Du Teillay&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Doutelle&quot;), a 16-gun privateer.

Encouraged by the French victory in May 1745 at the Battle of Fontenoy, Charles and his party set sail on 5 July for Scotland. During the voyage north, Charles&#x27;s squadron was fired upon by HMS &quot;Lion&quot; in the Celtic Sea. The &quot;Du Teillay&quot;, with Charles on board, made sail to escape, while the &quot;Elisabeth&quot;, with her greater firepower, engaged &quot;Lion&quot;. When &quot;Lion&quot; withdrew, the &quot;Elisabeth&quot; was forced to return to Brest for repairs, taking the majority of Charles&#x27;s supplies, including some 1,800 broadswords, 8 artillery pieces and most of the 1,500 muskets he had purchased. The &quot;Du Teillay&quot; successfully landed him and seven companions at Eriskay on 23 July 1745. The group would later be known as the Seven Men of Moidart and included John O&#x27;Sullivan, an Irish exile and former French officer, and Charles&#x27;s secretary George Kelly. Many Catholic and Protestant Highland clans still supported the Jacobite cause, and Charles hoped for a warm welcome from these clans to start an insurgency by Jacobites throughout Britain. However, receiving a cool reception from the clan leaders there, many of those contacted advised him to return to France, including MacDonald of Sleat and Norman MacLeod. Aware of the potential impact of defeat, they felt that by arriving without French military support, Charles had failed to keep his commitments and was unconvinced by his personal qualities. Undeterred, Charles set sail again and arrived at the bay of Loch nan Uamh. He had hoped for support from a French fleet, but it was not forthcoming, and he decided to raise an army in Scotland.

===Early stages and victory at Prestonpans: 1745===
Although several clan chiefs initially discouraged him, he gained the crucial support of Donald Cameron of Lochiel, Chief of Clan Cameron, after Charles provided &quot;security for the full value of his estate should the rising prove abortive.&quot; Thereafter, support continued to grow. It is recorded that during this time, Charles began to take lessons in conversational Gaelic under the tutorship of Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair. On 19 August, he raised his father&#x27;s standard at Glenfinnan and gathered a force large enough to enable him to march towards Edinburgh. The force proceeded eastwards, reaching Invergarry Castle by the last week of August. Charles&#x27;s forces continued on via the Corrieyairack Pass, where their control of the pass persuaded advancing government forces to withdraw from the area. Stopping briefly first at Blair Castle, Charles and his forces reached Perth on 4 September. At Perth, his ranks were joined by more sympathisers, including Lord George Murray. Previously pardoned for his participation in the 1715 and 1719 risings, Murray took over from O&#x27;Sullivan due to his better understanding of Highland military customs, and the Jacobites spent the next week re-organising their forces. On 14 September, Charles and his forces took Falkirk, and Charles stayed at Callendar House, where he persuaded the Earl of Kilmarnock to join him.

Charles&#x27;s progress onto Edinburgh was helped by the action of the British leader, General Sir John Cope, who had marched to Inverness, leaving the south country undefended. On 16 September, Charles and his army encamped outside the city at Gray&#x27;s Mill in Longstone. Lord Provost Archibald Stewart controlled the city, which quickly surrendered. However, the castle under the command of George Preston did not surrender and was blockaded until Charles later called off the siege owing to a lack of artillery. On 17 September, Charles entered Edinburgh, accompanied by around 2,400 men. During this time, Charles also gave trophies to his supporters, a prominent example being Prince Charlie&#x27;s Targe. Allan Ramsay painted a portrait of Charles while he was in Edinburgh, which survived in the collection of the Earl of Wemyss at Gosford House and, , was on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. 

Meanwhile, Sir John Cope had brought his forces by sea to Dunbar, a decision he would soon regret. On 20 September, Charles mustered and joined his forces at Duddingston. On 21 September, Charles and his forces defeated Cope&#x27;s army, the only government army in Scotland, at the Battle of Prestonpans. Charles was said to have been only 50 paces from the front-line of the battle, and he later expressed remorse that the victory involved killing his own subjects. It was reported during the battle that Charles and Lord Murray had argued over the disposition of forces. The historian Hugh Douglas argues this was to result in an ever-worsening relationship between the two that would culminate with ultimate defeat later at Culloden.

===Invasion of England: 1745–1746===
Morale was high following the battle at Prestonpans, and Charles returned to Edinburgh, holding court at Holyrood Palace. Jacobite morale was further boosted in mid-October when the French landed with supplies of money and weapons and an envoy, which seemed to validate claims of French backing. However, Lord Elcho later claimed that his fellow Scots were already concerned by Charles&#x27;s autocratic style and fear his Irish advisors overly influenced him. A &quot;Prince&#x27;s Council&quot; of senior leaders was established; Charles resented it as an imposition by the Scots on their divinely appointed monarch, while the daily meetings accentuated divisions between the factions. The council was said to include Perth, Lord George Murray, Thomas Sheridan, John O&#x27;Sullivan, Murray of Broughton, Lochiel, Keppoch, Clanranald, Glencoe, Ardsheal and Lochgarry. After much discussion, Charles persuaded his council to agree to invade England. By November, Charles was marching south at the head of an army numbering approximately 6,000 men. On 10 November, Carlisle surrendered to Charles. Continuing south, Charles and his army reached Penrith on 21 November, then Preston on the 26 November and Manchester on the 29 November. His army progressed as far south as the River Trent at Swarkestone Bridge in Derbyshire, arriving there on the 4 December.

At Derby, despite Charles&#x27;s objections, his council at Exeter House decided to return to Scotland given the lack of English Jacobite and French support, as well as rumours that large government forces were being amassed. Charles admitted that he had not heard from the English Jacobites since leaving France despite claiming the contrary; this caused his relationship with some of the Scots to become irretrievably damaged. On 6 December, the Jacobites and Charles left Derby and began their march north back to Scotland. Charles&#x27;s route north was the same as the one he had taken on the journey south. He returned to Manchester on 9 December, and after some light resistance from the local population, Charles demanded £5,000 from the town, eventually receiving £2,500 in payment. Charles then proceeded on through Preston, Lancaster, and Kendal until the Jacobite forces eventually met the government forces at Clifton in Cumbria on 18 December. The Jacobite forces won the Clifton Moor Skirmish, allowing them to continue north through Carlisle and back into Scotland.

Charles and his forces reached Glasgow on 26 December, resting until 3 January 1746. The decision was then made to lay siege to Stirling and Stirling Castle. However, while the town surrendered immediately, the castle&#x27;s artillery proved too strong for the Jacobite forces to approach and seize the castle. Government forces also attempted a relief of the siege, which resulted in a victory for Charles in the ensuing Battle of Falkirk Muir in January 1746. A failure to take the castle, however, resulted in the abandonment of the siege and the Jacobite forces moving northward to Crieff, then Inverness. With a halt in operations until the weather improved, Charles forces then rested at Inverness, including a stay of some four days at Kilravock Castle. Charles and his troops were then required to move after word reached them of the pursuit against them by the forces of George II&#x27;s son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland.

===Culloden and return to France: 1746===

Government forces caught up with Charles and his army at the ensuing Battle of Culloden on 16 April. Charles ignored the advice of his subordinate Lord George Murray and chose to fight on flat, open, marshy ground, where his forces were exposed to superior firepower from government troops. To ensure his safety, his officers requested that Charles command his army from behind the front lines, preventing him from gaining a clear view of the battlefield. He hoped that Cumberland&#x27;s army would attack first, and he had his men stand exposed to the accurate fire from government artillery batteries. Seeing the error in this, he quickly ordered an attack, but his messenger was killed before the order could be delivered. The Jacobite attack was uncoordinated, charging into withering musket fire and grapeshot fired from the cannons, and it met with little success. In the centre, the Jacobites reached the first line of government troops, but a second line of soldiers eventually repulsed this attack. The remaining Jacobite survivors in the front line fled. However, the Jacobite Army units fighting on the north-eastern side of the battlefield, as well as Irish and Scots regulars in the second line, retired in good order, allowing Charles and his personal retinue to escape northwards. 

After the defeat, Murray led a group of Jacobites to Ruthven, intending to continue the fight. Charles thought he was betrayed but abandoned the Jacobite cause. Some 20 miles from the battlefield, Charles rested briefly at Gorthleck, the home of his dubious supporter Lord Lovat, before retreating to Invergarry Castle, by way of Fort Augustus, on 16 April. Charles then hid in the moors of the Highlands of Scotland, before making a flight to the Hebrides, always barely ahead of the government forces. Many Highlanders aided him during his escape, and none betrayed him for the £30,000 reward. While Charles was in the Hebrides, funds had arrived from Spain and France on two ships that called at Lochaber. Too late to assist Charles following Culloden, only the Spanish gold was landed, but much of it was lost.

Charles was assisted by supporters such as the pilot Donald Macleod of Galtrigill and Captain Con O&#x27;Neill, who took him to Benbecula. From 16 April until 28 June, Charles travelled through Benbecula, South Uist, North Uist, Harris, and the Isle of Lewis. On 28 June, Charles was aided by Flora MacDonald, who helped him sail to the Isle of Skye by taking him in a boat disguised as her maid &quot;Betty Burke&quot;. Charles remained on Skye until July when he then crossed back to the mainland. With the aid of a few loyal servants and local supporters, Charles hid from government forces in the western Grampian Mountains for several weeks. He ultimately evaded capture, and on 19 September, he left the country aboard the French frigate &quot;L&#x27;Heureux&quot;, commanded by Richard Warren. The Prince&#x27;s Cairn marks the traditional spot on the shores of Loch nan Uamh in Lochaber from which he made his final departure from Scotland.

==Later life==
===Life in Europe: 1746–1766===
Charles landed back in France on . On his return, he was initially received warmly by King Louis XV, but as far as obtaining additional military or political assistance was concerned, his efforts proved fruitless. However, he became at once the popular hero and idol of many Parisians on account of his exploits in Scotland. In March 1747, he travelled briefly to Madrid via Lyon for an audience with Ferdinand VI of Spain, but the King rejected the idea of Spain providing help to restore the Stuarts. His relationship with his brother Henry deteriorated during this time, when Henry accepted a cardinal&#x27;s hat in July 1747. He also deliberately broke off communication with his father in Rome (who had approved of his brother&#x27;s action). 
While back in France, Charles had numerous mistresses. He had a relationship with his first cousin Marie Louise de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, wife of Jules, Prince of Guéméné, that resulted in a short-lived son named Charles (born 28 July 1748, died 18 January 1749). In December 1748, he was arrested by the French authorities while attending the opera at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal. Briefly imprisoned at the Château de Vincennes, he was then expelled from France under the terms of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle that ended the War of the Austrian Succession. He moved first to the Papal territory at Avignon, and then in 1749 to Lunéville in the Duchy of Lorraine. In the following years, he was reported to have made several visits in secret to Paris, but was not discovered by the French authorities.

After his defeat, Charles indicated to the remaining supporters of the Jacobite cause in England that, accepting the impossibility of his recovering the English and Scottish crowns while he remained a Catholic, he was willing to commit himself to reigning as a Protestant. Accordingly, he visited London incognito in 1750, staying for several weeks primarily at the Essex Street London residence of Lady Primrose, the widow of the 3rd Viscount of Primrose. While in London, Charles abjured the Catholic faith and conformed to the Protestant faith by receiving Anglican communion, likely at one of the remaining non-juring chapels. Bishop Robert Gordon, a staunch Jacobite whose house in Theobald&#x27;s Row was one of Charles&#x27;s safe-houses for the visit, is the most likely to have celebrated the communion. A chapel in Gray&#x27;s Inn, used by the nonjurors, was suggested as the venue as early as 1788. This rebuts David Hume&#x27;s suggestion that it took place at a church in the Strand. and biographers such as Kybett who have suggested St Martin-in-the-Fields.

Charles lived for several years in exile with his Scottish mistress, Clementina Walkinshaw (later known as Countess von Alberstrof), whom he met, and may have begun a relationship with, during the 1745 rebellion. She was suspected by many of Charles&#x27;s supporters of being a spy planted by the Hanoverian government of Great Britain. On 29 October 1753, the couple had a daughter, Charlotte. Charles&#x27;s inability to cope with the collapse of the Jacobite cause led to his problem with alcohol, and mother and daughter separated from Charles with his father James&#x27;s assistance.

In 1759, at the height of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Charles was summoned to a meeting in Paris with the French foreign minister, the Duc De Choiseul. Charles failed to make a good impression, being argumentative and idealistic in his expectations. Choiseul was planning a full-scale invasion of England involving upwards of 100,000 men, to which he hoped to add a number of Jacobites led by Charles. However, he was so little impressed with Charles that he dismissed the prospect of Jacobite assistance. The French invasion, which was Charles&#x27;s last realistic chance to recover the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland for the Stuart dynasty, was ultimately thwarted by naval defeats at Quiberon Bay and Lagos.

===Pretender: 1766–1788===
Charles&#x27;s father died on 1 January 1766. Pope Clement XI had recognised James as King of England, Scotland, and Ireland as &quot;James III and VIII&quot;, but over 40 years later Pope Clement XIII did not give Charles the same recognition as &quot;Charles III&quot;. However, on 23 January, with the Pope&#x27;s permission, Charles moved into the Palazzo Muti, which his father had lived in for over 40 years. Charles wrote to both the Kings of France and Spain on his accession, but recognition as King Charles III was not granted by either monarch. Charles returned to his social life in Rome, making visits to the Pope and indulging in pastimes such as hunting, shooting, balls, concerts, operas and plays. One notable occasion, was when he met and heard Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart perform at the Chigi Palace on 6 April. However, he would periodically shut himself away in his rooms, and was said to have formed no new friendships in his later life. He made visits to Florence and Pisa in 1770, where he took to the waters at the city&#x27;s thermal baths. Charles returned to Paris in early 1771 with the permission of the French authorities under the Duc de Choiseul, who once again wished to discuss the possibility of a Jacobite invasion. However, on the day of the meeting, Charles was reported to be so intoxicated that he was unable to speak coherently, so the discussions were abandoned.

By the time Charles entered his 51st year, concern was raised by his Jacobite supporters and the French that he had not yet married, and that only his brother, a priest sworn to celibacy, remained as the only male heir. The French also wished to continue the Stuart line as a potential weapon against the government in Britain. In 1771, while he was in Paris, Charles dispatched Sir Edmund Ryan, an Irish officer in Berwick&#x27;s regiment, to seek out a bride for him. Despite some potential negotiations with prospective brides, he was unable to find a wife. A few months later, Charles&#x27;s companion, the Duc d&#x27;Aiguillion, and his cousin Charles Fitz-James Stuart suggested the latter&#x27;s sister-in-law Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern as a prospective bride. Accordingly, on 28 March 1772, Charles married Princess Louise by proxy. The couple met shortly after for the first time at Macerata on 17 April 1772, where the marriage was reported to have been consummated.

They lived first in Rome and then moved to Florence in 1774, where he was provided with a residence by Prince Corsini, the Palazzo di San Clemente, now known as the &quot;Palazzo del Pretendente&quot;. In Florence, he used the title &quot;Count of Albany&quot; as an alias, and his wife Louise was normally referred to as the &quot;Countess of Albany&quot;. Charles&#x27;s health deteriorated in later life, and he was reported to have suffered from asthma, high blood pressure, swollen legs and ulcers. In 1774, while in Florence, he suffered constantly from his illnesses, which required him to be carried by his servants to and from his carriage. Charles was also known to be an alcoholic, a condition that worsened with age.

Charles and Louise left Florence in 1777 and returned to Rome. Their relationship had become increasingly quarrelsome. One cause was said to be the speculation regarding Louise&#x27;s adulterous relationships with the courtiers Carl Bonstetten and the Italian poet Count Vittorio Alfieri. Another cause was stated to be Charles himself, who was reported as becoming increasingly irrational and drunk. In November 1780, Louise formally left Charles. After separating, she claimed that Charles had physically abused her. This claim was generally believed by contemporaries. The historian Douglas states that Charles had been drinking following Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day celebrations, and after accusing Louise of infidelities, may have attempted to rape her, resulting in her screaming to the extent that the household servants intervened. In the years that followed, the Pope awarded Louise half of Charles&#x27;s papal pension, and Charles&#x27;s international reputation was greatly damaged. He was said to live an increasingly isolated and unhappy life, especially after his brother Henry agreed to house Louise at his estate.

By 1783, Charles&#x27;s health continued to decline, and for a time, he fell seriously ill such to the extent that he was given the Sacraments. Although Charles recovered, he agreed to create a new will, and signed an act of legitimation for his illegitimate daughter Charlotte. Charles also gave her the title &quot;Duchess of Albany&quot; in the peerage of Scotland and the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;, but these honours did not give Charlotte any right of succession to the throne. Charlotte lived with her father in Florence and Rome for the next five years. Eventually, she survived her father by less than two years, dying unmarried at Bologna in November 1789. In April 1784, Charles was persuaded by the visiting King Gustav III of Sweden to grant Louise a decree of separation. While not a formal divorce, as no such legal procedure existed in the Papal States, Louise was thereby legally permitted to live separately from her husband, even though she had been doing so for some time. Charles spent the majority of his last years living between Florence and Rome. However, he left Florence for the last time in 1785 and returned to Rome. It was reported that he was limited to light travelling by his doctors owing to his fragility.

==Death and burial==

Charles died in Rome of a stroke on 30 January 1788, aged 67. His brother the Cardinal Duke of York, who was present at the death, had the record read that he died on the morning of 31 January, as it was deemed unlucky to have him declared dead on the same date as the execution of his great-grandfather, King Charles I. Charles&#x27;s will left most of his estate to his heir, his daughter Charlotte. There were a few exceptions, including some plates for his brother Henry, as well as some annuities for his servants.

On his death, a cast of his face was made, and his body was embalmed and placed in a coffin of cypress wood. Adorned with the Order of the Thistle, the Cross of St Andrew, the Order of the Garter and the Cross of St George, Charles was first buried in Frascati Cathedral near Rome, where his brother Henry was bishop. At Henry&#x27;s death in 1807, Charles&#x27;s remains (except his heart) were moved to the crypt of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican, where they were laid to rest next to those of his brother and father. This was below the spot where the monument to the Royal Stuarts by Antonio Canova would later be erected. His mother Maria is also buried nearby at St Peter&#x27;s. Charles&#x27;s heart remained in Frascati Cathedral, where it is contained in a small urn beneath the floor, under a monument.

==Cultural depictions==
Charles has been depicted in painting since the 18th century, much of it belonging to Romanticism and later Victorian representations of the Jacobites. Charles&#x27;s departure from Scotland in 1746 is depicted in an engraving of a painting by Francis William Topham, In 1892, John Pettie painted Charles entering the Ballroom at Holyroodhouse. Charles and the Jacobites would also be depicted in numerous drawings, prints and on objects, his likeness and coat of arms even depicted on objects such as engraved drinking glasses.

Charles has been depicted on stage as well as in film and television. He was portrayed by David Niven in the 1948 semi-biographical film &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;. Charles was also portrayed by Andrew Gower in the historical dramatic series &quot;Outlander&quot;, based upon Diana Gabaldon&#x27;s book series. His life has formed a component of numerous historical plays, including &quot;For Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; (1897), the &quot;Young Pretender&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Glory&quot; (2000).

The legacy of Charles Stuart and his role in Jacobitism has also influenced songs and music. Examples include the folk songs &quot;&quot;, &quot;Bonnie Charlie&quot;, &quot;Wha&#x27;ll be King but Charlie?&quot; and &quot;Charlie is my darling&quot;. Charles&#x27;s subsequent flight from Scotland is commemorated in &quot;The Skye Boat Song&quot; by the English author Sir Harold Edwin Boulton and in the Irish song &quot;Mo Ghile Mear&quot; by Seán Clárach Mac Domhnaill. The popular song &quot;My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean&quot; could be in reference to him as a way to refer to him but also to any woman. It was covered by Tony Sheridan and the Beatles in 1961.

==Arms==
During his pretence as Prince of Wales, Charles claimed a coat of arms consisting of those of the kingdom, differenced by a &quot;label argent of three points&quot;.

<doc id="57551" wikidata="Q6334" url="?curid=57551" title="Third Punic War">
<text>The Third Punic War (149–146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars fought between Carthage and Rome. The war was fought entirely within Carthaginian territory, in what is now northern Tunisia. When the Second Punic War ended in 201 BC one of the terms of the peace treaty prohibited Carthage from waging war without Rome&#x27;s permission. Rome&#x27;s ally, King Masinissa of Numidia, exploited this to repeatedly raid and seize Carthaginian territory with impunity. In 149 BC Carthage sent an army, under Hasdrubal, against Masinissa, the treaty notwithstanding. The campaign ended in disaster as the Battle of Oroscopa ended with a Carthaginian defeat and the surrender of the Carthaginian army. Anti-Carthaginian factions in Rome used the illicit military action as a pretext to prepare a punitive expedition.

Later in 149 BC a large Roman army landed at Utica in North Africa. The Carthaginians hoped to appease the Romans, but despite the Carthaginians surrendering all of their weapons, the Romans pressed on to besiege the city of Carthage. The Roman campaign suffered repeated setbacks through 149 BC, only alleviated by Scipio Aemilianus, a middle-ranking officer, distinguishing himself several times. A new Roman commander took over in 148 BC and fared equally badly. At the annual election of Roman magistrates in the spring of 147 BC the public support for Scipio was so great that the usual age restrictions were lifted to allow him to be appointed consul and commander in Africa.

Scipio&#x27;s term commenced with two Carthaginian successes, but he tightened the siege and started to build a large mole to prevent supplies from getting into Carthage via blockade runners. The Carthaginians had partially rebuilt their fleet, and it sortied, to the Romans&#x27; surprise. After an indecisive engagement, the Carthaginians mismanaged their withdrawal and lost many ships. The Romans then built a large brick structure in the harbour area that dominated the city wall. Once this was complete, Scipio led a strong force that stormed the camp of Carthage&#x27;s field army and forced most of the towns and cities still supporting Carthage to surrender. In early 146 BC the Romans launched their final assault and, over six days, systematically destroyed the city and killed its inhabitants; only on the last day did they take prisoners, 50,000 of them, who were sold into slavery. The conquered Carthaginian territories became the Roman province of Africa, with Utica as its capital. It was a century before the site of Carthage was rebuilt as a Roman city.

==Primary sources==
The main source for most aspects of the Punic Wars is the historian Polybius ( – ), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics, but he is best known for &quot;The Histories&quot;, written sometime after 146 BC. He accompanied his patron and friend, the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus, in North Africa during the Third Punic War; this causes the normally reliable Polybius to recount Scipio&#x27;s actions in a favourable light. In addition, significant portions of &quot;The Histories&quot;″ account of the Third Punic War have been lost.

The account of the Roman annalist Livy, who relied heavily on Polybius, is much used by modern historians of the Punic Wars, but all that survives of his account of events after 167 BC is a list of contents. Other ancient accounts of the Third Punic War or its participants which have also been largely lost include those of Plutarch, Dio Cassius and the Greek Diodorus Siculus. Modern historians also use the account of the 2nd-century AD Greek Appian. The modern historian Bernard Mineo states that it &quot;is the only complete and continuous account of this war&quot;. It is thought to have been largely based on Polybius&#x27;s account, but several problems with it have been identified. These issues mean that of the three Punic Wars, the third is the one about which the least is reliably known. Other sources include coins, inscriptions, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions.

==Background==
In the mid-2nd century BC Rome was the dominant power in the Mediterranean region, while Carthage was a large city-state in the north east of what is now Tunisia. The Carthaginians were referred to by the Romans by the Latin word (or ) and is a reference to Carthage&#x27;s Phoenician origin. &quot;Punic&quot; derives from this usage. Carthage and Rome had fought the 23-year-long First Punic War from 264 to 241 BC and the 17-year-long Second Punic War between 218 and 201 BC. Both wars ended with Roman victories; the Second when the Roman general Scipio Africanus defeated Hannibal, the premier Carthaginian general of the war, at the Battle of Zama, south-west of Carthage. Africanus imposed a peace treaty on the Carthaginians which stripped them of their overseas territories and some of their African ones. An indemnity of 10,000 silver talents was to be paid over 50 years. Hostages were taken and Carthage was prohibited from waging war outside Africa—and could wage war in Africa only with Rome&#x27;s express permission. Many senior Carthaginians wanted to reject the treaty, but Hannibal spoke strongly in its favour and it was accepted in spring 201 BC. Henceforth, it was clear that Carthage was politically subordinate to Rome.

At the end of the war Masinissa, an ally of Rome, emerged as by far the most powerful ruler among the Numidians, the indigenous population which controlled much of what is now Algeria and Tunisia. Over the following 50 years, he repeatedly took advantage of Carthage&#x27;s inability to protect its possessions. Whenever Carthage petitioned Rome for redress or permission to take military action, Rome backed Masinissa and refused. Masinissa&#x27;s seizures of and raids into Carthaginian territory became increasingly flagrant. In 151 BC Carthage raised a large army commanded by the previously unrecorded general Hasdrubal and, the treaty notwithstanding, counter-attacked the Numidians. The campaign ended in disaster at the Battle of Oroscopa and the army surrendered. Many Carthaginians were subsequently massacred by the Numidians. Hasdrubal escaped to Carthage, where, in an attempt to placate Rome, he was condemned to death.

Carthage paid off its indemnity in 151 BC and was prospering economically but was no military threat to Rome. Nevertheless, there had long been a faction within the Roman Senate that had wished to take further military action against Carthage. For example, the dislike of Carthage by the senior senator Cato was so well known that since the 18th century (AD), he has been credited with ending all of his speeches with (&quot;Carthage must be destroyed&quot;). The opposing faction included Scipio Nasica, who argued that fear of a strong enemy such as Carthage would keep the common people in check and avoid social division. Cato was a member of an embassy to Carthage, probably in 153 BC, and noted her growing economy and strength; Nasica was likely a member of the same embassy. Using the illicit Carthaginian military action as a pretext, Rome began preparing a punitive expedition.

Modern scholars have advanced several theories as to why Rome was eager for war. These include: a Roman fear of Carthaginian commercial competition; a desire to forestall a wider war which might have broken out with the death of Masinissa, who was aged 89 at the time; the factional use of Carthage as a political &quot;bogeyman&quot;, irrespective of its true power; a greed for glory and loot; and a desire to quash a political system which Rome considered anathema. No consensus has been reached regarding these and other hypotheses. Carthaginian embassies attempted to negotiate with Rome, which responded evasively. The large North African port city of Utica, some north of Carthage, went over to Rome in 149 BC. Aware that Utica&#x27;s harbour would greatly facilitate any assault on Carthage, the Senate and the People&#x27;s Assembly of Rome declared war on Carthage.

The Romans elected two men each year, known as consuls, as senior magistrates, who at time of war would each lead an army; on occasion their term of office was extended. A large Roman army landed at Utica in 149 BC under both consuls for the year, Manius Manilius commanding the army and Lucius Marcius Censorinus the fleet. The Carthaginians continued to attempt to appease Rome and sent an embassy to Utica. The consuls demanded that they hand over all weaponry; reluctantly the Carthaginians did so. Large convoys took enormous stocks of equipment from Carthage to Utica. Surviving records state that these included 200,000 sets of armour and 2,000 catapults. Carthage&#x27;s warships all sailed to Utica and were burnt in the harbour. Once Carthage was disarmed, Censorinus made the further demand that the Carthaginians abandon their city and relocate away from the sea; Carthage would then be destroyed. The Carthaginians abandoned negotiations and prepared to defend their city.

== Opposing forces ==
The city of Carthage was unusually large for the time: modern scholars give population estimates ranging from 90,000 to 800,000. Any of these would make Carthage one of the most populous cities in the Mediterranean area at the time. It was strongly fortified with walls of more than circumference. Defending the main approach from the land were three lines of defences, of which the strongest was a brick-built wall wide and high with a ditch in front of it. Built into this wall was a barracks capable of holding over 24,000 soldiers. The city had few reliable sources of ground water but possessed a complex system to catch and channel rainwater and many cisterns to store it.

The Carthaginians raised a strong and enthusiastic force to garrison the city from their citizenry and by freeing all slaves willing to fight. They also formed a field army at least 20,000 strong, which was placed under Hasdrubal, freshly released from his condemned cell. This army was based at Nepheris, south of Carthage. Appian gives the strength of the Roman army which landed in Africa as 84,000 soldiers; modern historians estimate it at 40,000–50,000 men, of whom 4,000 were cavalry.

==Course of the war==
=== 149 BC ===
The Roman army moved to Carthage, unsuccessfully attempted to scale the city walls, and settled down for a siege. They set up two camps under command of legates: Censorinus&#x27;s had the primary role of protecting the beached Roman ships and Manilius&#x27;s housed the Roman legions. Hasdrubal moved up his army to harass the Roman supply lines and foraging parties. The Romans launched another assault on the city but were repulsed again. Scipio Aemilianus, the adopted grandson of Scipio Africanus, who was serving as a tribunea middle-ranking military positionheld back his men and was able to deploy them to beat off the pursuing Carthaginians, preventing heavy losses.

The camp established by Censorinus was badly situated and by early summer was so pestiferous that it was moved to a healthier location. This was not as defensible, and the Carthaginians inflicted losses on the Roman fleet with fireships. The Romans then made these attacks more difficult by building additional fortifications. Nevertheless, the Carthaginians repeatedly attacked the camps. In often confused fighting Scipio distinguished himself further by his role in thwarting these; the discipline which he imposed on his troops was in contrast with the behaviour of most of the rest of the Roman army.

Manilius decided to strike against the Carthaginians&#x27; main camp near Nepheris, despite its strong position and fortifications. Arriving there, Manilius ordered an immediate assault, against Scipio&#x27;s advice. This initially went well, but the Romans advanced into an untenable position. When they attempted to withdraw, the Carthaginians counterattacked, inflicting heavy casualties. Scipio led 300 cavalrymen in a series of limited and well-disciplined charges and threats which caused the Carthaginians to pause long enough for most of the infantry to complete their retreat. That night Scipio led his cavalry back to rescue a trapped group of Romans. The Roman column retreated to its camp near Carthage, where a committee from the Senate had arrived to evaluate Scipio and Manilius&#x27; progress. Scipio&#x27;s performance was prominent in their subsequent report.
Scipio made contact with several of the leaders of Carthage&#x27;s Numidian cavalry, then joined a second, better-planned expedition led by Manilius against Hasdrubal at Nepheris. Despite the greater forethought, the Romans made no progress, although one of the Numidians contacted by Scipio did defect to the Romans with 2,200 men. Manilius withdrew after the Romans ran out of food and Scipio led the Romans&#x27; new allies on a successful foraging expedition.

=== 148 BC ===
The Romans elected two new consuls in 148 BC, but only one of them was sent to Africa: Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus; Lucius Hostilius Mancinus commanded the navy as his subordinate. He pulled back the close siege of Carthage to a looser blockade and attempted to mop up the other Carthaginian-supporting cities in the area. He failed: Neapolis surrendered and was subsequently sacked, but Aspis withstood assaults from both the Roman army and navy, while Hippo was fruitlessly besieged. A Carthaginian sortie from Hippo destroyed the Roman siege engines, causing the Romans to break off the campaign and go into winter quarters. Hasdrubal, already in charge of the Carthaginian field army, overthrew the civilian leadership of Carthage and took command himself. Carthage allied with Andriscus, a pretender to the Macedonian throne. Andriscus had invaded Roman Macedonia, defeated a Roman army, had himself crowned King Philip VI and sparked the Fourth Macedonian War.

=== 147 BC ===

Scipio intended to stand in the 147 BC elections for the post of , which was a natural progression for him. Aged 36 or 37, he was too young to stand as consul, for which by the the minimum age was 41. There was considerable political manoeuvring behind the scenes. Scipio and his partisans played on his successes over the previous two years and the fact that it was his adoptive grandfather, Scipio Africanus, who had sealed Roman victory in Africa in the Second Punic War. Public demand to appoint him as consul and so allow him to take charge of the African war, was so strong that the Senate put aside the age requirements for all posts for the year. Scipio was elected consul and appointed to sole command in Africa; usually theatres were allocated to the two consuls by lot. He was granted the usual right to conscript enough men to make up the numbers of the forces there and the unusual entitlement to enroll volunteers.

Scipio moved the Romans&#x27; main camp back to near Carthage, closely observed by a Carthaginian detachment of 8,000. He made a speech demanding tighter discipline and dismissed those soldiers he considered ill-disciplined or poorly motivated. He then led a successful night attack and broke into the city with 4,000 men. Panicked in the dark, the Carthaginian defenders, after an initial fierce resistance, fled. Scipio decided that his position would be indefensible once the Carthaginians reorganised themselves in daylight and so withdrew. Hasdrubal, horrified at the way the Carthaginian defences had collapsed, had Roman prisoners tortured to death on the walls, in sight of the Roman army. He was reinforcing the will to resist in the Carthaginian citizens; from this point, there could be no possibility of negotiation or even surrender. Some members of the city council denounced his actions and Hasdrubal had them too put to death and took full control of the city.

The renewed close siege cut off landward entry to the city, but a tight seaward interdiction was all but impossible with the naval technology of the time. Frustrated at the amount of food being shipped into the city, Scipio built an immense mole to cut off access to the harbour via blockade runners. The Carthaginians responded by cutting a new channel from their harbour to the sea. They had built a new fleet and once the channel was complete, the Carthaginians sailed out, taking the Romans by surprise. In the ensuing Battle of the Port of Carthage the Carthaginians held their own, but when withdrawing at the end of the day many of their ships were trapped against the city&#x27;s sea wall and sunk or captured. The Romans now attempted to advance against the Carthaginian defences in the harbour area, eventually gaining control of the quay. Here, over several months, they constructed a brick structure as high as the city wall, which enabled up to 4,000 Romans to fire onto the Carthaginian ramparts from short range.

Once this feature was complete, Scipio detached a large force and led it against the Carthaginian field army at Nepheris. The Carthaginians, commanded by a Greek named Diogenes, had established a fortified camp for their winter quarters. Late in 147 BC Scipio directed an assault on the camp from several directions and overran it. Fleeing Carthaginians were pursued by Rome&#x27;s mounted Numidian allies and few escaped. The town of Nepheris was then besieged and surrendered after three weeks. Most of the fortified positions still holding out in Carthage&#x27;s hinterland now opened their gates.

=== 146 BC ===
Scipio&#x27;s position as the Roman commander in Africa was extended for a year in 146 BC. In the spring he launched a full-scale assault from the harbour area, which successfully breached the walls. Over six days, the Romans systematically worked their way through the residential part of the city, killing everyone they encountered and setting the buildings behind them on fire. On the last day Scipio agreed to accept prisoners, except for 900 Roman deserters in Carthaginian service, who fought on from the Temple of Eshmoun and burnt it down around themselves when all hope was gone. At this point, Hasdrubal surrendered to Scipio on the promise of his life and freedom. Hasdrubal&#x27;s wife, watching from a rampart, then blessed Scipio, cursed her husband and walked into the temple with her children to burn to death.

50,000 Carthaginian prisoners were sold into slavery. The notion that Roman forces then sowed the city with salt is likely a 19th-century invention. Many of the religious items and cult-statues which Carthage had pillaged from Sicilian cities and temples over the centuries were returned with great ceremony.

==Aftermath==
Rome was determined that the city of Carthage remain in ruins. The Senate despatched a ten-man commission and Scipio was ordered to carry out further demolitions. A curse was placed on anyone who might attempt to resettle the site in the future. The former site of the city was confiscated as , public land. Scipio celebrated a triumph and took the &quot;agnomen&quot; &quot;Africanus&quot;, as had his adoptive grandfather. Hasdrubal&#x27;s fate is not known, although he had surrendered on the promise of a retirement to an Italian estate. The formerly Carthaginian territories were annexed by Rome and reconstituted to become the Roman province of Africa, with Utica as its capital. The province became a major source of grain and other food.

The Punic cities which had stood by Carthage to the end were forfeit to Rome as , or, as in the case of Bizerte, were destroyed. Surviving cities were permitted to retain at least elements of their traditional system of government and culture. The Romans did not interfere in the locals&#x27; private lives and Punic culture, language and religion survived, and is known to modern scholars as &quot;Neo-Punic civilization&quot;. The Punic language continued to be spoken in north Africa until the 7th century AD.

In 123 BC a reformist faction in Rome led by Gaius Gracchus was eager to redistribute land, including publicly held land. This included the site of Carthage and a controversial law was passed ordering the establishment of a new settlement there, called Junonia. Conservatives argued against the law and after its passage spread rumours that markers delimitating the new settlement had been dug up by wolvesa very poor omen. These rumours, and other political machinations, caused the plan to be scrapped. In 111 BC legislation repeated the injunction against any resettlement. A century after the war, Julius Caesar planned to rebuild Carthage as a Roman city, but little work was done. Augustus revived the concept in 29 BC and brought the plan to completion. Roman Carthage had become one of the main cities of Roman Africa by the time of the Empire.

Rome still exists as the capital of Italy; the ruins of Carthage lie east of modern Tunis on the North African coast. A symbolic peace treaty was signed by Ugo Vetere and Chedli Klibi, the mayors of Rome and modern Carthage, respectively, on 5 February 1985; 2,131 years after the war ended. As of 2020 the modern settlement of Carthage was a district of the city of Tunis.

<doc id="57553" wikidata="Q5044924" url="?curid=57553" title="Carolina shag">
<text>The Carolina shag is a partner dance done primarily to beach music (100–130+ beats per minute in 4/4 time signature). The shag is a recognized dance in modern national and international dance competitions. It became the official state dance of South Carolina in 1984 and the official popular dance of North Carolina in 2005.

==Technique==
The basic step in Carolina shag is a six-count, eight-step pattern danced in a slot. The rhythm is similar to six-count Swing in that it is triple step, triple step, rock step or counted as &quot;one-and-two, three-and-four, five-six&quot;. Eight shag dance steps are in the basic pattern. The &quot;one-and-two&quot; and &quot;three-and-four&quot; steps should take about as much time to complete as the &quot;five-six.&quot;

Carolina shag often bears only the faintest resemblance to other dances that share the &quot;shag&quot; designation.

==History==

The term &quot;Carolina shag&quot; is thought to have originated along the Atlantic Ocean in Cherry Grove Beach, South Carolina during the 1940s. According to Bo Bryan, a Carolina shag historian and resident of Beaufort County, the term was coined at Carolina Beach, North Carolina. The Carolina shag is a descendant of Carolina Jitterbug, and its predecessor, Little Apple, which was the white version of the Big Apple (whose origins can be traced to Columbia, South Carolina in 1937) after whites sat (after &quot;jumping the Jim Crow rope&quot;) in the balconies in the black clubs to watch the dancing.

==Cultural references==
The 1989 film &quot;Shag&quot; starring Bridget Fonda, Phoebe Cates, Annabeth Gish, and Page Hannah as four high-school friends on their last road trip together before graduation, was filmed in Myrtle Beach and features the Carolina shag.

In 1997, the country music band Alabama recorded the single called &quot;Dancin&#x27;, Shaggin&#x27; on the Boulevard&quot; referencing this style of dance and the band&#x27;s own history of playing at the Carolina shore where the dance originated.

In mid- to late August 2018, SiriusXM satellite radio added a channel called Carolina Shag. It replaced a summertime channel dedicated to The Beach Boys. SiriusXM describes the channel as being &quot;dedicated to the vintage R&amp;B sounds that have meant Summer in the Carolinas for decades&quot;.

<doc id="57554" wikidata="Q79842" url="?curid=57554" title="Flagstaff, Arizona">
<text>Flagstaff ( ) is the county seat of Coconino County, Arizona, in the southwestern United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 76,831.

Flagstaff is the principal city of the Flagstaff metropolitan area, which includes all of Coconino County, and has a population of 145,101. Flagstaff lies near the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau and within the San Francisco volcanic field, along the western side of the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the continental United States. The city sits at around and is next to Mount Elden, just south of the San Francisco Peaks, the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona. Humphreys Peak, the highest point in Arizona at , is about north of Flagstaff in Kachina Peaks Wilderness. The geology of the area includes exposed rock from the Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras, with Moenkopi Formation red sandstone having once been quarried in the city; many of the historic downtown buildings were constructed with it. The Rio de Flag river runs through the city, but only flows in response to rain or snowmelt.

Originally settled by the pre-Columbian native Sinagua people, the area of Flagstaff has fertile land from volcanic ash after eruptions in the 11th century. It was first settled as the present-day city in 1876. Local businessmen lobbied for Route 66 to pass through the city, which it did, turning the local industry from lumber to tourism and developing downtown Flagstaff. In 1930, Pluto was discovered from Flagstaff. The city developed further through to the end of the 1960s, with various observatories also used to choose Moon landing sites for the Apollo missions. Through the 1970s and 1980s, downtown fell into disrepair, but was revitalized with a major cultural heritage project in the 1990s.

The city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as Nestlé Purina PetCare, and is home to the U.S. Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station, the U.S. Geological Survey, and Northern Arizona University. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to Grand Canyon National Park, Oak Creek Canyon, the Arizona Snowbowl, Meteor Crater, and Historic Route 66.

== Etymology ==
At the time of Beale&#x27;s wagon road, the area was known as Antelope Spring, after the spring at the foot of Mars Hill (now called Antelope/Old Town Spring). The name Flagstaff comes from an actual flagstaff made from a stripped pine tree that was erected at the spring, which McMillan was using as his sheep camp, on July 4, 1876.

The common story tells that the flag-raising for which the town was named occurred when a ponderosa pine flagpole made by a scouting party from Boston (known as the &quot;Second Boston Party&quot;) was raised to celebrate the United States Centennial. Various other stories have been told of the circumstances. One says that on July 4, 1855, a surveyor for the railroad by the name of Samuel Clark Hudson, accompanied by his team, climbed a tall pine tree and tied a flag, with another saying it was Beale&#x27;s men who raised the flag in 1859. The town was still known as Antelope Spring in 1871.

After the town took the name Flagstaff, it began to be known as &#x27;Old Town&#x27; for a period, and was known by different names when the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad was being built through the area in 1882. It may have been known as Flagstaff Spring for a while, and &#x27;Old Town Spring&#x27; after this before simply &#x27;Old Town&#x27;, a name given after a fire destroyed much of the town, with a new community then raised a few hundred yards away called &#x27;New Town&#x27;. Another version of the Old and New Town names says that the railroad depot was moved by half a mile to prevent hill starts, and business owners soon followed it, displacing the commerce of the town to Front Street of &#x27;New Town&#x27; while the houses were still in &#x27;Old Town&#x27; with the spring; when the fire burned down &#x27;Old Town&#x27;, &#x27;New Town&#x27; remained. The name Flagstaff was reinstated in 1884 when a post office was introduced alongside the railroad depot.

The city has different names in local Native languages. In Navajo, it is known as &quot;&quot;. This name is formed from , meaning &quot;many houses&quot; or city, , the name for the San Francisco Peaks but literally &quot;the summit which never melts&quot;, and Biyaagi, indicating &#x27;below&#x27; (see translations of ): the city below the San Francisco Peaks. The word Kinłání alone may refer to Flagstaff, but also can refer to Durango, Colorado. In Havasupai, Flagstaff is known as &quot;Wii Hagnbaj&quot;. This is also a name for the San Francisco Peaks, and literally means &quot;snowy mountain&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
The Sinagua people were a pre-Columbian culture that occupied a large area in Arizona between &quot;circa&quot; 500 and 1425 CE. The Northern Sinagua were living in the pine forests of northern Arizona before moving into the area that is now Flagstaff about 700 CE. The 1064 and 1066 eruptions of Sunset Crater covered the area in ash, which greatly enriched the soil for farming; this also caused a population growth in the area, with Ancestral Puebloans and Cohonina people also moving to the Wupatki site near the city.

The Northern Sinagua had various cultural phases, including Sunset Crater, the Rio de Flag (leaving the Picture Canyon site), Angell and Winona, Padre Canyon, Elden Pueblo, Turkey Hill Pueblo, Clear Creek, and Walnut Canyon. The Sinagua peoples left the area by the early 15th century, likely moving north and later becoming the Hopi. The San Francisco Peaks, which overlook Flagstaff, are a sacred site in Hopi culture.

Until western expansion in the 1860s, the Yavapai, specifically the (Northeastern Yavapai), occupied the land up to the San Francisco Peaks. The Yavapai land in the area saw overlap with the land of the Northern Tonto Apache that stretched across the San Francisco Peaks to the Little Colorado River. Of the Northern Tonto Apache, two tribes lived within the area of present-day Flagstaff: the Oak Creek band and the Mormon Lake band. The Mormon Lake band were centered around Flagstaff and were exclusively hunter-gatherers, traveling around places like the foot of the San Francisco Peaks, at Mount Elden, Lake Mary, Stoneman Lake, and Padre Canyon.

===19th century===
The area of Flagstaff had a wagon road to California in the 1800s, constructed by Edward Fitzgerald Beale&#x27;s men. The first White (non-Native) settlement in the area was established by Edward Whipple, who opened a saloon on the wagon road in 1871. The first permanent settlement came in 1876, when Thomas F. McMillan built a cabin just north of the present-day main town. McMillan was a key developer of Northern Arizona.

During the 1880s, Flagstaff began to grow, and by 1886, Flagstaff was the largest city on the railroad line between Albuquerque and the West Coast of the United States. In 1888, McMillan purchased an unfinished building that sits at the present-day intersection of Leroux Street and Route 66/Santa Fe Avenue, turning it into a bank and hotel known as the Bank Hotel. Coconino County was created in 1891, and Flagstaff was chosen as its county seat over nearby Williams.

In 1894, A. E. Douglass recommended Flagstaff to Percival Lowell as the site for the Lowell Observatory, where it was built on Mars Hill. Flagstaff also became incorporated as a town in 1894. The city grew rapidly, primarily due to its location along the east–west transcontinental railroad line in the United States. In the 1890s, the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company was founded by the Riordan brothers to process timber. Michael and Tim Riordan worked in Flagstaff, and introduced electricity to the town for this purpose. The Riordan brothers established the first library in Flagstaff. The CO Bar Ranch was opened in about 1886 by the Babbitt brothers for cattle. The Babbitt family would be very influential in northern Arizona for decades. In 1899, the Northern Arizona Normal School was established; it was renamed to Northern Arizona University (NAU) in 1966.

On January 1, 1900, John Weatherford opened the Weatherford Hotel in Flagstaff. Weatherford opened the town&#x27;s first movie theater in 1911; it collapsed under heavy snowfall a few years later, but he soon replaced it with the Orpheum Theater. The Weatherford Hotel and Orpheum Theater are still in use today.

===1912–1969===

The state of Arizona was admitted to the Union in 1912. Flagstaff saw its first tourism boom in the early years of the 1900s, becoming known as the City of Seven Wonders, as the &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; of the wider Flagstaff area – listed as the Coconino National Forest, Grand Canyon, Oak Creek Canyon, San Francisco Peaks, Sunset Crater, Walnut Canyon, and Wupatki National Monument – were more widely known.

==== U.S. Route 66 ====

In 1926, Route 66 was completed and ran through Flagstaff; the Babbitts and Riordans had staunchly supported it for the town. The railroad, which became the Santa Fe Railroad, had largely controlled Flagstaff until this point. The Santa Fe Railroad opened a new depot in Flagstaff in 1926, to combat Route 66. As part of the celebrations, Front Street was renamed Santa Fe Avenue. The people of Flagstaff collectively funded the Hotel Monte Vista, which opened on January 1, 1927, preparing for the next tourism boom. Flagstaff was then incorporated as a city in 1928, with over 3,000 residents, and in 1929, the city&#x27;s first motel, the Motel Du Beau, was built at the intersection of Beaver Street and Phoenix Avenue. Flagstaff became a popular tourist stop along Route 66, particularly due to its proximity to the natural wonders. In the last years of the 1920s, tourism took over from traditional industries.

During the Great Depression, Route 66 brought unemployed workers heading to California, known as &quot;auto nomads&quot; in Flagstaff, who became unpopular as they could not afford to buy gas or food, financially damaging the city by taxing its resources and not contributing to the economy. Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by Clyde Tombaugh&#x27;s 1930 discovery of Pluto from the Lowell Observatory. However, the importance of Route 66 to cross-country travel, and thus to Arizona&#x27;s interests on a national level, did mean that it received a large share of state funding through the Depression, with highway maintenance and unemployment acts providing over $1 million of funding in May 1933. In 1935, many residents had enough disposable income to remodel their homes or build new ones.

In 1955, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was established. Through the 1950s the city conducted the Urban Renewal Project, improving housing quality in the Southside neighborhood that was largely populated by people of Spanish, Basque, and Mexican heritage. Flagstaff grew and prospered through the 1960s. During the Apollo program in the 1960s, the Lowell Observatory Clark Telescope was used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to map the Moon for the lunar expeditions, enabling the mission planners to choose a safe landing site for the lunar modules.

===1970s–present===
As the baby boomer generation began to start their own families in the 1970s and 1980s, many moved to Flagstaff based on its small-town feel, and the population began to grow again; there were not enough jobs to support the many educated individuals moving to the city. The city did not expand its infrastructure downtown despite the growing population, causing problems. Several historic buildings from the 1800s were also destroyed for construction of new ones, or leveled completely. Downtown Flagstaff became an uninviting place, and many businesses started to move out of the area, causing an economic and social decline.

During the 1990s, the city redeveloped. Store owners in downtown supported the Main Street programs of preservation-based revitalization, and in 1992, the city hired a new manager to improve the area: a different mix of shops and restaurants opened up to take advantage of the area&#x27;s historical appeal. Heritage Square was built as the center of the revitalized downtown, the local Flagstaff Pulliam Airport began running more flights to Phoenix, and the school district was expanded with a third high school, Sinagua High School.

On October 24, 2001, Flagstaff was recognized by the International Dark-Sky Association as the world&#x27;s first &quot;International Dark-Sky City&quot;.

==Geography==
Flagstaff is the county seat of Coconino County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which only (0.08%) is water. Flagstaff lies at approximately elevation, and is surrounded by the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in North America. It is in a mountainous area, and lies along the Rio de Flag watercourse. It is about north of the State capital, Phoenix.

The geology of the area is in line with that of the Colorado Plateau on which it lies, with the Moenkopi red sandstone abundant in the city also used to build many of the distinctive buildings forming its cityscape. The cityscape of Flagstaff is its historic downtown area centered on Heritage Square, with the historic nature of its restored buildings and local theme iconic to the city and representative of its culture. Flagstaff is one of the United States&#x27; sunniest and snowiest cities, with a variable &quot;semi-arid&quot; climate and a monsoon season in summer.

The San Francisco Peaks are a main aspect of Flagstaff&#x27;s local geography and can be seen from everywhere in the city. Humphreys Peak is the highest point in Arizona at . Several trails around the peaks provide views of the Grand Canyon. While the most popular access point is Arizona Snowbowl (southwest face), the peaks can also be approached from the north and east. The peaks are about northwest of downtown Flagstaff, with the Snowbowl resort just southwest of Humphreys Peak. The wildlife of the peaks include mule deer, elk, turkey vultures, and black bears, all visible from public trails.

===Geology and topography===

Flagstaff lies on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, and is largely limestone under San Francisco volcanic field. The oldest rock types of the area are part of North America&#x27;s original crust, Precambrian granite and schist from 1.7 to 1.8 billion years ago. On top of this is Paleozoic sandstone, limestone, shale and siltstone deposited on what was then (544 to 248 million years ago) different surfaces, including a shallow seabed, muddy land, and sandy desert. The rock layers from this period are (bottom to top): Tapeats Sandstone, Bright Angel Shale and Muav Limestone, Martin Formation, Redwall Limestone, Supai Group, Coconino Sandstone, Toroweap Formation, and Kaibab Limestone. The last three of these are still exposed. On top of the Paleozoic rock is Mesozoic Moenkopi Formation, from 248 to 65 million years ago. Other Mesozoic layers formed on top of this, but were eroded away. In the Flagstaff area, layers of rock from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras accumulated up to deep, but most of this was eroded. A soft basalt layer covers some of the rock at the surface.

Moenkopi Formation red sandstone is a distinctive feature of Flagstaff, as it was used as a building material from the 1880s because of its fire retardant properties. The source used for quarrying most of this rock was a deposit 1 mile east of the town, which fell under the control of Charles Begg in 1887, who then began selling the stone across the southwest – after he made a successful sale in California that expanded the business, he was replaced in 1888 by a master quarryman. While it was used as building material across the West, some of Flagstaff&#x27;s most prominent buildings are famous for the stone, including the Bank Hotel, Weatherford Hotel, Babbitt Brothers Building, Coconino County Courthouse, and various NAU buildings, including Old Main.

In the Laramide orogeny, which began about 65–75 million years ago, the Western United States underwent stress in rock formation; in the Four Corners region this pushed up the preexisting layers and ultimately formed the Colorado Plateau (and the Rocky Mountains). Around Flagstaff more specifically, this process deformed flat rock layers into folds, and allowed surface rivers to cut deep canyons in the younger rock layers. From about 25 million years ago, more faults were broken again in Flagstaff, and volcanic activity began about 6 million years ago with magma flowing up these faults to create lava flows. Eruptions occurred between 3 million and 1,000 years ago, affecting the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks. The city&#x27;s Mount Elden is a lava dome made of dacite, Sunset Crater is the youngest feature of the San Francisco volcanic field and formed in the last 1,000 years by an explosive eruption, while S P Crater was formed between 75,000 and 70,000 years ago by piles of lapilli and volcanic bombs spouting from a lava lake.

In the 1960s, the geology and topography of the Flagstaff area, including formations like Meteor Crater, was seen as similar to environments that would be encountered on the Moon in terms of planetary geology. The Astrogeology Research Program was therefore moved to Flagstaff in 1962, with the program completing in 1963, to train astronauts.

===Climate===
Flagstaff&#x27;s climate type on the Köppen climate classification system is variously reported as a warm dry-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;), a Hemiboreal climate (&quot;Dsb&quot; and &quot;Dfb&quot;), and a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;). It is consistently described as &quot;semi-arid&quot;. Flagstaff&#x27;s Köppen type is recorded as &quot;Dsb&quot; in the city center, with areas of &quot;BSk&quot;, &quot;Csb&quot;, &quot;Csa&quot; (hot-summer Mediterranean), &quot;Cwa&quot; (monsoon-influenced humid subtropical), &quot;Cwb&quot; (subtropical highland), &quot;Dwa&quot; (monsoon-influenced hot summer humid continental), &quot;Dwb&quot; (monsoon-influenced warm summer humid continental), and &quot;Dsa&quot; (Mediterranean-influenced hot summer humid continental) on the outskirts and bordering the city; it is mostly &quot;Dsb&quot;, &quot;BSk&quot;, and &quot;Csb&quot;.

The hottest temperature on record is in July 1973. This is far below a normal summer day in lowland areas of the state. The coldest temperature on record is in January 1937. Warm summer nights are very uncommon with the all-time record being in July 2002 and a regular summer averages a very mild for the warmest low. Cold daily maximums are occasional, but rarely severe. The record low high is from January 1963, but the mean for the coldest maximum is relatively close to freezing at .

Like most of the state, Northern Arizona experiences a summer monsoon season from July to September, with Flagstaff&#x27;s wettest months being July and August, and its driest being June, all in the summer; Mediterranean climates have wet season only in the winter. Mediterranean climate categorization does not consider snowfall. Semi-arid climates will receive of annual rainfall, while Flagstaff experiences more.

Flagstaff&#x27;s hardiness zone is mostly 6a, with some areas 5b, meaning plants withstand temperatures down to . It is in the Transition life zone; the concept of life zones was first observed in the Flagstaff area. Wind in Flagstaff typically blows southwesterly throughout the year, based on topographical features. The city&#x27;s climate data is observed from Flagstaff Pulliam Airport.

The city receives precipitation every year, with two distinct wet periods in the summer and winter; the summer monsoon season accounts for 34% of annual rainfall, with the winter producing 28%. The summer monsoon season, originating from the Mexican monsoon period, is also wetter than winter, with an average compared to the winter&#x27;s . Before the summer monsoon each year there is a dry period in May and June. Long-term average precipitation is annually, with much heavier rainfall attributed to El Niño events. Comparatively, La Niña events have caused below-average rainfall.

Since 1996 the city has been experiencing its driest period, known as the Early-21st Century Drought. As of 2007, Richard Hereford of USGS speculated that the effects of the drought, predicted to last until the late 2020s, may be severe because of Flagstaff&#x27;s growing population and global warming. The summer wet season is more reliable and consistent than other times of year, but due to the high temperatures of the area this rainfall is quickly lost to evaporation. During the Early-21st Century Drought, rainfall has been consistently below average in all but the summer season, with temperature averages for all but the summer (which has remained consistent) also increasing.

Equally, snowfall has been lower during the extended dry period, though the city set a new record for its highest daily snowfall on February 21, 2019, with and was still ranked as the United States&#x27; third-snowiest city in 2020 (based on 2018–19 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data). Flagstaff has consistently been among the snowiest cities in the United States, and snow and winter culture is argued by Michael Weeks to be a large part of Flagstaff&#x27;s identity. The Arizona Snowbowl is a major attraction, though it has had to make artificial snow during warmer seasons, and the city tried to launch a bid to be the host city of the 1960 Winter Olympics. The maximum daily snow cover was on December 20, 1967, although the mean maximum for a full winter is only . However, due to the infrequent and scattered nature of the snowstorms, persistent snowpack into spring is rare. One notable exception occurred during the severe winter of 1915–16, when successive Pacific storms buried the city under over of snow, and some residents were snowbound in their homes for several days. The earliest seasonal trace of snowfall occurred on September 19, 1965, and the latest on May 29 in both 1971 and 1990.

Though one of the least-sunny cities in Arizona, Flagstaff still ranks among the United States&#x27; sunniest cities, having sunshine for an average 78% of the year. The city receives much more sunshine than other snowy cities, which are primarily in the north of the country.

====Seasonal weather====
There are four seasons in Flagstaff, with cool to cold winter temperatures averaging and warm summer temperatures averaging , much cooler than much of Arizona; the average annual snowfall is . Spring begins in April with cool or comfortable weather. Sometimes, snow reappears in May, but the spring period is typically mild and dry, lasting until early June. The summer is warm, measured between days when freezing temperatures occur, beginning in June – the last freezing temperature generally in early June – and ending in September. Flagstaff&#x27;s summer will receive a few days of daytime temperatures above , with much cooler nighttime temperatures typically in the region of . Flagstaff&#x27;s summers are also notable for the monsoon season in July and August, when thunderstorms occur almost daily. Thunderstorm activity happens mostly during the daytime.

Freezing temperatures (below ) return towards the end of September, with the mild fall season having daytime temperatures around . With its many trees, leaves do change color in Flagstaff&#x27;s fall, with the change starting at the end of September and happening throughout October. Fall lasts only until the snow comes in November, with winter marked between periods of snowfall, typically from November until mid-April at the latest. Temperatures in winter are usually below freezing, going no higher than around in the day, even in sunshine. Nights can regularly plummet below . A combination of snow cover and high pressure occurring during winter months will cause the temperature to drop further, once reaching a record low of . Flagstaff&#x27;s winter wet season is caused by Pacific storms and lasts from November through April.


===Flora and fauna===
Flagstaff is an area &quot;of great ecological variation&quot; due to its diverse habitat life zones. Tree species abound the area, which covers three arboreal life zones: Douglas fir and aspen forest, Ponderosa pine forest, and Pinyon-juniper woodland. It is at the heart of the Coconino National Forest. Within the Transition zone of the forest, including in the city, there are huge stands of ponderosa pine. Other species scattered among this region include Gambel oak, quaking aspen, and Rocky Mountain juniper trees.

The Coconino National Forest and Flagstaff are within the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in North America. Here, this tree type is formed as a climax forest, with groups of trees containing different ages spread among the forest. Some of the groups are only a few trees, some are acres large; other groups are even-aged. The irregularity of the tree groups leaves natural openings in the forest, allowing for other plants to thrive. A grass cover of Arizona fescue grows around the area and shrub exists, but there are few other tree species. As well as the Gambel oak, quaking aspen, and juniper trees, pinyons can be found among the pines. Some of the open forest space contains bunchgrass, and local animal species that roam on this include elk, mule deer, Merriam&#x27;s Turkey, and Abert&#x27;s squirrel.

The arboretum in Flagstaff has an extensive regional collection of the Penstemon genus and hosts an annual Penstemon Festival.

Coconino is also home to a variety of bird species, which is further diversified by species from desert climates south of the Mogollon Rim still mixing in the area. The nearby lakes also attract wildlife. Birds that live around or visit Flagstaff include the thick-billed kingbird, only documented in the area since 2016, the red-faced warbler, a Madrean species, and waterfowl including the Eurasian wigeon and American wigeon.

===Cityscape===
Flagstaff has a diverse cityscape and exists in distinct areas. Downtown Flagstaff is a &quot;narrow and slender&quot; area between the NAU campus at its south and the Museum of Northern Arizona at the north. Flagstaff is a smaller city, so its downtown is largely local and independent. The city&#x27;s mall is found in East Flagstaff, as is a Harkins movie theater and a country club and golf course. Residential properties in East Flagstaff are larger and more rural than other parts of the city. North West Flagstaff is directly north of downtown, and is where the Snowbowl and Museum of Northern Arizona are found. West Flagstaff encompasses the area south and west of downtown, including NAU and the Lake Mary neighborhood. It also covers the airport and Fort Tuthill (county park and the Pepsi Amphitheater), being bordered to the south by the urban areas of Kachina Village and Mountainaire. Outside of the city proper, these urban areas have a &quot;mountain-town feel&quot;. Flagstaff has an &quot;urban forest park&quot;, Buffalo Park, which sits on top of McMillan Mesa and used to be home to a zoo in the 1960s. Buffalo Park/McMillan Mesa bisects the city, separating East Flagstaff from West Flagstaff and downtown.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 census, the population of the city was 65,870. This accounted for a population density of , with 26,254 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 73.4% White, 1.9% Black or African American, 11.7% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 7.3% from other races, and 3.6% from two or more races; 18.4% of the population were Hispanics or Latinos of any race. The city&#x27;s African American population is considerably lower than the U.S. average (1.9% versus 12.6%), while the Native American population is markedly higher (11.7% vs. 0.9%). This is primarily attributable to the city&#x27;s proximity to several Native American reservations. Flagstaff&#x27;s Native American community is chiefly Navajo, and there are about 5,500 people of Navajo ancestry living in the city.

A 1970 study found that while the Native American population of Flagstaff was generally under-counted in censuses, the Native residents found that Flagstaff as a border city with reservations was much more welcoming than similar towns, particularly noting Gallup, New Mexico, as one that was worse. The study also documented that while there was a distinctly Native neighborhood in the poorer Southside area of Flagstaff, the housing quality varied greatly, with middle class Native residencies elsewhere in the city.

Though Flagstaff has a low African American population, it had seen large immigration of black people from the Southern United States in the middle of the 20th century during the Great Migration. Though most moved to California, there was a significant number that settled in Flagstaff after hearing that the lumber industry of northern Arizona was some of the best paid work going, and a familiar vocation for those from southern states.

===Crime===
Flagstaff has two police departments: Flagstaff PD and NAU PD. NAU PD employs 30 officers and 25 students, and is responsible for law enforcement on the campus. Flagstaff PD will share information of concern about the neighborhoods surrounding the NAU campus to the NAU PD, and NAU PD may also respond to situations off-campus that involve students; NAU PD also investigates the missing person reports of students who are registered as resident on campus. From campus phones, all 911 calls will go to NAU PD.

The rate of crime in Flagstaff is above average, while its violent crime rate is below average, for the United States. For 2017, the FBI&#x27;s Uniform Crime Report indicated for Flagstaff a rate of 290 cases of violent crime per 100,000 people and 2,710 cases of property crime per 100,000 population; the violent crime rate across the US was 382.9 per 100,000. In 2018, Flagstaff had a rate of 469.4 cases of all crimes per 100,000 people, up 10.7% on the total in 2017; this was below the average for Arizona, but above the average for the US. Until 2017, Flagstaff&#x27;s crime rate was typically in line with the US average.

The safest neighborhood in Flagstaff is Elden Pueblo, with several downtown areas, NAU and the surrounding neighborhoods, Fort Valley, and Cosnino all in the top ten. In 2017, Flagstaff PD responded to four hostage situations, including in Tuba City, and fifteen explosive device removal calls. There were 3,262 criminal investigations. The Flagstaff narcotics task force headed up &#x27;Operation Nightfall&#x27; between 2015 and 2017, aiming to prevent the use of I-40 through the city being used by Mexican drug cartels for trafficking, successfully seizing over of cocaine. Within Flagstaff, there were over 100 arrests relating to other narcotics crimes.

NAU operates as a weapon-free and drug-free campus (even medical marijuana), with restrictions on alcohol possession for resident students over 21 within certain private areas of certain residence halls. In 2016, it became a tobacco-free campus. Additionally, alcohol may not be consumed in public on the campus. The overwhelming majority of NAU PD recorded crimes are related to drugs and alcohol, with hundreds of arrests each year and over 1500 disciplinary referrals in 2018. The second-most recorded area of crime on the campus is gender based violence (rape, domestic abuse), with a few dozen cases. There are over 160 blue light phones on the campus; each has a large button that connects directly to NAU PD and provides the location of the call to them.

The police in Flagstaff also deal with skunk-related problems, including suspected burglaries that turn out to be skunks. The skunks can be an issue in the city, as they start rabies epidemics among animals every few years.

==Economy==
In its early days, the city&#x27;s economic base comprised the lumber, railroad, and ranching industries. Today, that has largely been replaced by tourism, education, government, and transportation. Some of the larger employers in Flagstaff are Northern Arizona University, the Flagstaff Medical Center, and the Flagstaff Unified School District. Tourism is a large contributor to the economy, as the city receives over 5 million visitors per year.

Scientific and high tech research and development operations are in the city, including Lowell Observatory, Northern Arizona University, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) and the United States Geological Survey&#x27;s (USGS) Flagstaff campus. Research is involved in observations of near-Earth phenomena such as asteroids and comets. In 2012 the observatory commissioned its Lowell Discovery Telescope, a 4.3-meter telescope with an instrument cube that can hold five instruments at once. Lowell Observatory and NOFS also are collaborators on the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. NOFS is heavily involved with the science of star catalogs and astrometry, or the positions and distances of stars and celestial objects.

There are five industrial parks in the city, situated near I-40 and I-17. Major manufacturers in Flagstaff include W. L. Gore &amp; Associates, widely known as the maker of Gore-Tex; Nestlé Purina PetCare, manufacturer of pet food; SenesTech, a biotechnology research lab and manufacturer; SCA Tissue, a major tissue paper producer; and Joy Cone, manufacturer of ice cream cones. Walgreens operated a distribution center in the city until 2014.

===Tourism===

Flagstaff has a thriving tourism industry, and has since the early 1900s, primarily stemming from its proximity to the Grand Canyon National Park and other natural wonders, giving it the nickname &#x27;City of Seven Wonders&#x27;. Other natural wonders and native ruins, Route 66, and its astronomical history also bring tourism from out of state, while people from further south in Arizona visit Flagstaff because of its cooler climate in the summer and its ski resort in the winter. The city has several hotels and restaurants, including its historic hotels. The first hotel of the Ramada Inn chain opened in 1954 at the intersection of Routes 66, 89, and 89A, adjacent to what was then Arizona State College (now NAU). The original building is still intact, operating as a Super 8 motel. Flagstaff is said to attract a lot of the tourism for the entire county as it is the only large population center that can cater to tourists, as well as being the location of information points for the National Park Service (NPS). In 1996, 39% of Coconino County residents were employed in tourism. There are large service sectors, particularly hotels and restaurants, in Flagstaff, with many of these companies having a close connection to NAU&#x27;s School of Hotel and Restaurant Management, to employ these students.

Tourism to Flagstaff is a well-established industry, but still relies on environmental forces. Nature and weather conditions can damage tourism; having a mild but warm summer temperature attracts tourists from many locales, but storms and forest fires in its climate can be a detraction. Flagstaff also experiences very cold winters, and despite a successful ski resort still sees less tourism in this period; decreasing snow levels also threaten the winter industry. The pristine condition of the natural sites can also experience degradation due to overuse through tourism, losing its main selling point. The development of Tusayan into the Grand Canyon gateway town also affected Flagstaff&#x27;s capture of some overnight tourists.

The Grand Canyon, a Wonder of the World, is about northwest of Flagstaff. The first stagecoach tours to the Grand Canyon from the city began running from the Bank Hotel in 1892. In 2000, about 5 million people visiting the Grand Canyon also visited Flagstaff. As Rick Heffernon wrote, &quot;the world recognizes only one Grand Canyon, and northern Arizona has it&quot;. However, he also suggested this can act to the area&#x27;s detriment, as the Grand Canyon is a world-class marvel and competes with other attractions of the same prestige for visitors, which are all equally impressive; Flagstaff itself also competes with its nearby towns for access to the Grand Canyon, several of which have growing themes based on it (like Tusayan and the Grand Canyon Village).

Lowell Observatory celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2019 and continues to be a leading astronomical research center, as well as a popular destination for visitors. More than 100,000 people visited in both 2018 and 2019; in 2019 the observatory opened its new Giovale Open Deck Observatory, an observation plaza with a suite of six advanced telescopes.

Arizona Snowbowl does not publish their revenue or make it public knowledge, which makes it hard to calculate its impact on the Flagstaff economy. The Snowbowl supports approximately 200 full-time jobs and $12.08 million in economic output for the city of Flagstaff.

Heffernon suggested that the perception of tourism from the residents of Flagstaff could affect the industry, something researched in 1990 by NAU&#x27;s Tim Schroeder. Schroeder saw six main areas of concern from Flagstaff residents: &quot;Standard of Living for Residents; Future Use of Parks; Quality of Fire Protection; Occurrences of Crime; Changes in Community Values, Norms and Customs; and Population Density&quot;. He acknowledged that the focus on fire protection was anomalous, and likely caused by a particularly high concern surrounding recent wildfires at the time the survey had been conducted. The respondents to Schroeder&#x27;s survey generally found that their &quot;Opportunity for Jobs, Opportunity for Shopping, Quality of Fire Protection, Understanding Different People, Quality of Health Care, Availability of Cultural Arts, and Overall Quality of Life&quot; had improved because of tourism to the area, but that standards in terms of &quot;Traffic and Road Conditions, General Prices for Goods and Services, Future Use of Forests, Noise, Litter, Air Quality, and Occurrences of Crime&quot; had worsened.

==Arts and culture==
===Local culture===

Flagstaff has its own New Year&#x27;s Eve tradition; in the city, people gather around the Weatherford Hotel as a , tall, metallic pine cone is dropped from the roof at midnight. The tradition originated in 1999, when Henry Taylor and Sam Green (owners of the hotel), decorated a garbage can with paint, lights, and pine cones, and dropped it from the roof of their building to mark the new millennium. By 2003 the event had become tradition, and the current metallic pine cone was designed and built by Frank Mayorga of Mayorga Welding in the city.

Local museums include the Museum of Northern Arizona, which features displays of the biology, archeology, photography, anthropology, and native art of the Colorado Plateau, and the Arboretum at Flagstaff, a arboretum containing 2,500 species of drought-tolerant native plants representative of the high desert region.

A lot of the local culture is also focused on Route 66, which originally ran between Chicago and Los Angeles, greatly increased the accessibility to the area, and enhanced the culture and tourism in Flagstaff. Route 66 remains a historic route, passing through the city between Barstow, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico. In early September, the city hosts an annual event, Route 66 Days, to highlight its connection to the famous highway.

===Dark Sky City===
Flagstaff takes one of its nicknames from its designation as the world&#x27;s first International Dark Sky City, with deliberate measures to reduce light pollution beginning in 1958 supported by the environmentally-aware population and community advocates, government and elected officials, and the assistance of observatories in the area – including the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station and Lowell Observatory.

The city&#x27;s designation as an International Dark Sky City was on October 24, 2001, by the International Dark-Sky Association, after a proposal by the Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition to start the recognition program. It is seen as a world precedent in dark sky preservation. Before this, it had been nicknamed the &quot;Skylight City&quot; in the 1890s, the same decade that the Lowell Observatory was founded. In 1958, it passed Ordinance 400, which outlawed using large or powerful searchlights within city limits. In the 1980s a series of measures were introduced for the city and Coconino County, and the Dark Sky Coalition was founded in 1999 by Chris Luginbuhl and Lance Diskan. Luginbuhl is a former U.S. Naval astronomer, and Diskan had originally moved to Flagstaff from Los Angeles so that his children could grow up able to see stars, saying that &quot;part of being human is looking up at the stars and being awestruck.&quot; It was reported that even though greater restrictions on types of public lighting were introduced in 1989, requiring them all to be low-emission, some public buildings like gas stations hadn&#x27;t updated by 2002, after the Dark Sky designation.

Flagstaff and the surrounding area is split into four zones, each permitted different levels of light emissions. The highest restrictions are in south and west Flagstaff (near NAU and its observatory), and at the Naval, Braeside, and Lowell Observatories. Photographs detecting emissions taken in 2017 show that Flagstaff&#x27;s light is 14 times less than another Western city of comparable size, Cheyenne, Wyoming, which Luginbuhl described as &quot;even better than [they] might have expected&quot;.

===Arts===
Flagstaff has an active cultural scene. The city is home to the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra, which plays concerts from September through April at Ardrey Auditorium on the NAU campus. The city also attracts folk and contemporary acoustic musicians, and offers several annual music festivals during the summer months, such as the Flagstaff Friends of Traditional Music Festival, the Flagstaff Music Festival, and Pickin&#x27; in the Pines, a three-day bluegrass and acoustic music festival held at the Pine Mountain Amphitheater at Fort Tuthill Fairgrounds. Popular bands play throughout the year at the Orpheum Theater, and free concerts are held during the summer months at Heritage Square. 

Beyond music, Flagstaff has a popular theater scene, featuring several groups. Northern Arizona University&#x27;s Department of Theatre produces productions for the community as well as the campus. The department has won awards, including multiple invitations to the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival. NAU Theatre performs in two facilities: the Clifford E. White Theatre (named for long-time professor Clifford E. White) and the Studio Theatre. Both facilities are housed in the Fine and Performing Arts Building on campus. A local community theater company called Theatrikos was founded in 1972 in the basement of the Weatherford Hotel, and today puts on six major productions per year. In 2002, the company moved into a new venue now known as the Doris-Harper White Community Playhouse, a downtown building which was built in 1923 as an Elks Lodge and later became the Flagstaff library. Since 1995, the Flagstaff Light Opera Company has performed a variety of musical theater and light opera productions throughout the year at the Sinagua Middle School auditorium. There are several dance companies in Flagstaff, including Coconino Community College Dance Program, Northern Arizona Preparatory Company and Canyon Movement, which present periodic concerts and collaborate with the Flagstaff Symphony for free concerts during the summer and holiday seasons.

A variety of weekend festivals occur throughout the year. The annual Northern Arizona Book Festival, held in the spring, brings together authors to read and display their works. The Flagstaff Mountain Film Festival is held every October, and features a variety of independent films and documentaries focusing on extreme sports, environmental issues, and global topics. The festival is four days long and consists of several sessions of films. The screenings are held at the Orpheum Theater in the historic downtown area. The summer months feature several festivals, including Hopi and Navajo Festivals of Arts and Crafts, the Arizona Highland Celtic Festival, Pride in the Pines, and the Made in the Shade Beer Tasting Festival. For more than 20 years Flagstaff has hosted the 10-day Flagstaff Festival of Science in September. It is a family event which features open houses, lectures, informal talks, and hands-on activities at area museums, observatories, other scientific facilities, and the university. In-school programs also are an important part of the festival. The festival begins with the annual Eugene Shoemaker keynote address. Guest speakers have included famous astronauts, arctic explorers, storm chasers, and scientists from many disciplines. The Coconino County Fair is held every September at the Fort Tuthill County Fairgrounds, featuring a demolition derby, livestock auction, carnival rides, and other activities.

===Historic districts and properties===
Flagstaff is home to seven National Register of Historic Places historic districts: Southside, Townsite, Fort Tuthill, North End, Northern Arizona Normal School, the Railroad Addition, and USFS Fort Valley Experimental Forest Station, as well as a variety of many other structures and areas. The Lowell Observatory is a National Historic Landmark.

==Sports==
Flagstaff has no professional sports of its own, but is home to the college sports teams of Northern Arizona University. It is a popular training destination for a variety of sports, largely due to its altitude and climate.

===Northern Arizona Lumberjacks===
Northern Arizona University sponsors 15 sports at the NCAA Division I level, including a football team that competes at the Division I Football Championship Subdivision level. The NAU football team has a rivalry with the Southern Utah Thunderbirds, known as the Grand Canyon Rivalry, based on the universities residing on opposite sides of the Grand Canyon. All sports are members of the Big Sky Conference with the exception of the Women&#x27;s Swimming &amp; Diving team, which competes in the Western Athletic Conference. The Men&#x27;s Cross Country team has featured four straight top ten finishes at the NCAA Division I Cross Country championships. The track and field team has been home to several All-Americans, including NCAA Champion and Olympian Lopez Lomong (and brother Peter Lomong), two-time NCAA Champion David McNeill, and 2012 Olympian Diego Estrada.

===Arizona Cardinals===
From 1988 to 2012 (with the exception of the 2005 season), the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League held their summer training camp at Northern Arizona University. The 2005 training camp relocated to Prescott because of a norovirus outbreak at the university that emerged from a summer wrestling training camp and infected over 100 people. The NAU training camp was named as one of the top five training camps in the NFL by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, citing the cooler temperature, scenic area, and the possibility for fans to get close to athletes as key points. Players have said that the altitude of Flagstaff was the key benefit, as well as seeing the dedication of fans traveling to the city, but that they did not enjoy living in the NAU dorm rooms.

The Cardinals left Flagstaff in summer 2013, placing NAU at fault after the team was put in the visitors&#x27; facilities, though NAU had offered the home facilities when the concern was raised, and moved their training camp to State Farm Stadium in Glendale. At Glendale, they train in a domed stadium rather than outside, which player Bertrand Berry said took away some of the feeling of training camp, saying &quot;there really isn&#x27;t that need to practice outside when most of the games are inside, but when you talk about building a team and going through adverse situations and bonding together, I think they miss out on a little bit of that&quot;. The Cardinals had trained at NAU since the franchise moved to Arizona, with Fox Sports reporting that &quot;some argued they pulled the plug on the team&#x27;s only Arizona tradition&quot;. Bill Bidwill, owner of the Cardinals, was inducted into the Flagstaff Sports Foundation&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2009, after bringing the team and resultant tourism boost to the city for over 20 years.

===Altitude training destination===
Flagstaff is also a popular destination for altitude training. The first elite athletes to start altitude training in the city were those going to the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. A 2009 analysis showed that groups of 35 athletes spent three to eight weeks training in Flagstaff, to positive effect. This was one of the highest number of athletes and longest periods among seventeen sites used in the research. Australian rules football team Collingwood Magpies regularly train at NAU facilities, as does the Olympic-medal-winning Team GB British Swimming team. Another British Olympian, Mo Farah, trains in Flagstaff.

Long-distance runner Andrea Seccafien used to altitude train in Flagstaff but moved to Australia in 2018, saying &quot;We don&#x27;t go to Flagstaff or St. Moritz anymore which are more populated by runners and the general public. [...] Flagstaff feels quite metropolitan compared to where we are now&quot;; the Canadian &quot;Running Magazine&quot; noted that the city becomes host to many professional runners in the spring. The popularity among runners is because of the altitude and pleasant climate, making it &quot;for distance runners [...] a practically unparalleled paradise&quot;, known as the &quot;running mecca&quot;. Runner Nick Hilton said that &quot;Flagstaff and Boulder, Colorado, are probably the two biggest centers for elite distance runners in the country&quot;.

The HYPO2 altitude training center in the city is used by swimmers and runners alike, and is an elite facility that attracts many teams from around the world. HYPO2 was created in 2012, largely with staff from NAU&#x27;s Center for High Altitude Training, which closed in 2009. As of 2019, over 85 Olympic medalists from 44 countries trained at the facility. In 2016, the city advertised NAU and the HYPO2 with promotions saying &quot;The Road to Rio Runs Through Flagstaff&quot;, prominently noting that if Flagstaff (with its training athletes) was a country, it would be in the top 10 of Olympic-medal winning nations since 1996.

==Parks and recreation==
Flagstaff has acquired a reputation as a magnet for outdoor enthusiasts, and the region&#x27;s varied terrain, high elevation, and amenable weather attract campers, backpackers, climbers, recreation and elite runners, and mountain bikers from throughout the southwestern United States. There are of city parks in Flagstaff, the largest of which are Thorpe Park and Buffalo Park. Wheeler Park, next to city hall, is the location of summer concerts and other events. The city maintains an extensive network of trails, the Flagstaff Urban Trails System, or &quot;FUTS&quot; includes more than 50 miles of paved and unpaved trails for hiking, running, and cycling. The trail network extends throughout the city and is widely used for both recreation and transportation. There are over of urban trails in Flagstaff.

The area is a recreational hub for road cycling and mountain biking clubs, organized triathlon events, and annual cross country ski races. Several major river running operators are headquartered in Flagstaff, and the city serves as a base for Grand Canyon and Colorado River expeditions.

Flagstaff&#x27;s proximity to Grand Canyon National Park, about north of the city, has made it a popular tourist destination since the mid-19th century. Other nearby outdoor attractions include Walnut Canyon National Monument, Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, Wupatki National Monument, and Barringer Crater. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Lake Powell are both about north along U.S. Route 89.

==Government==

The city government is organized under a council–manager form of government. The mayor of Flagstaff is Becky Daggett, who was elected in November 2022. The town council consists of the mayor and six councilmembers: Austin Aslan (vice mayor), Jim McCarthy, Miranda Sweet, Lori Matthews, Deborah Harris, and Khara House (appointed as an interim councilmember in May 2022). On July 2, 2019, the city council named Greg Clifton as city manager among 50 candidates. Regular meetings of the city council are held on the first and third Tuesday of every month. The last mayoral election occurred in November 2022.

At the state level, Flagstaff is in the 6th legislative district. In the Arizona State Senate, the 6th is represented by Wendy Rogers (R) of Flagstaff. In the House of Representatives, the 6th is represented by Brenda Barton (R) of Payson and Walter Blackman (R) of Snowflake.

At the federal level, Flagstaff was redistricted in 2023 within Arizona&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, covering 20,219 sq. miles. The current 2nd is essentially the successor of what was Arizona&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 2003 to 2023. The district is represented by Eli Crane (R) of Oro Valley.

The City of Flagstaff raised its minimum wage above the State minimum wage in 2017. This wage increase was the result of a ballot measure – Proposition 414 – on the November 8, 2016, ballot. The City Council of Flagstaff then passed Title 15 of the City Ordinance, which provided for implementation of the new law. The new minimum wage in Flagstaff on July 1, 2017, was $10.50, fifty cents more than the Arizona state minimum wage. On January 1, 2021, the minimum wage rose to $15.00.

In 2023, the city prohibited gun range companies from airing ads at airport, but upon accusations of First Amendment violations, subsequently banned all ads besides city ads. Although some say this poses other Constitutional issues since commercial speech has protection under the Central Hudson Doctrine.

==Education==

There are 19 public schools, with 11,500 students and 800 faculty and staff, in the Flagstaff Unified School District. In 1997, Mount Elden Middle School was named an A+ School, citing an outstanding school climate, progressive use of technology and zero-tolerance approach to discipline. The 1999 National Science Teacher of the Year, David Thompson, teaches physics at Coconino High School. Three Arizona Teachers of the Year from 2001 through 2003 teach at Flagstaff High School. In 2012, Flagstaff was named America&#x27;s first STEM Community.

In addition to the numerous public schools, there are several charter schools operating in the Flagstaff area including Flagstaff Junior Academy, Northland Preparatory Academy (ranked No. 52 in &quot;US News&quot;″s America&#x27;s Top 100 Best High Schools), the Flagstaff Arts and Leadership Academy, Pine Forest Charter School, BASIS Flagstaff (ranked No. 2 in The Washington Post&#x27;s America&#x27;s Most Challenging High schools) and the Montessori Schools of Flagstaff.

Flagstaff is home to three institutions of higher education, Northern Arizona University (one of the three public state universities in Arizona); Coconino Community College; and Flagstaff College (a very small upper-division college with only one major – sustainability and social justice).

==Media==
The major daily newspaper in Flagstaff is the &quot;Arizona Daily Sun&quot;. Northern Arizona University&#x27;s weekly newspaper &quot;The Lumberjack&quot; also covers Flagstaff news, while the other publications that serve the city include weeklies &quot;Flagstaff Live&quot; and the &quot;Navajo Hopi Observer&quot;, and monthlies &quot;Mountain Living Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Noise&quot;. NAU runs several radio stations including KNAU and KPUB and their translator stations, which provide NPR and PRI news coverage, as well as classical music.

Flagstaff is included in the Phoenix Designated market area (DMA), the 13th largest in the U.S. Over-the-air television service is provided mostly by low-powered repeaters of the Phoenix stations. There are two local broadcast television stations serving the city, KNAZ-2 (NBC), and KFPH-13 (UniMás). In reality television, &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; built a home just outside Flagstaff for slain soldier Lori Piestewa&#x27;s two children and parents in 2005. In December 2007, talk show hostess Ellen DeGeneres selected Flagstaff as the winner of her show&#x27;s &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; contest.

===Film production===
In the early 20th century, the city was considered as a site for the film &quot;The Squaw Man&quot; by Jesse Lasky and Cecil B. DeMille, but was abandoned in favor of Hollywood. During the 1940s and 1950s, over 100 Westerns were filmed in Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon. The Hotel Monte Vista in Flagstaff hosted many film stars during this era, including Jane Russell, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne, and Bing Crosby. A scene from the movie &quot;Casablanca&quot; was filmed in one of the rooms of the hotel.

Several films then used Flagstaff&#x27;s Route 66 in scenes: the 1969 film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; were filmed on Milton Road and Route 66 as well as near Sunset Crater; a moment in the film&quot; National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; was filmed at a truck stop gas station near Little America Hotel in 1983; a small scene in &quot;Midnight Run&quot; was filmed in Flagstaff at the train depot, and the city was referenced in the film; several of the running scenes in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; were filmed in and around the area, including a memorable scene in which Forrest is seen jogging in downtown Flagstaff and gives inspiration to a bumper sticker designer; parts of 2007 Academy Award winner &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; were filmed at the junction of I-40 and I-17 in Flagstaff; and &quot;Terminal Velocity&quot; was partially filmed in the city. Grizzly Peak Films also filmed &quot;Sasquatch Mountain&quot;, a feature-length film for the Science Fiction Channel about a Yeti, in Flagstaff and Williams.

<text>In chemistry, an acid dissociation constant (also known as acidity constant, or acid-ionization constant; denoted ) is a quantitative measure of the strength of an acid in solution. It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction
:&lt;chem&gt;HA &lt;=&gt; A^- + H^+&lt;/chem&gt;
known as dissociation in the context of acid–base reactions. The chemical species HA is an acid that dissociates into , called the conjugate base of the acid, and a hydrogen ion, . The system is said to be in equilibrium when the concentrations of its components do not change over time, because both forward and backward reactions are occurring at the same rate.

The dissociation constant is defined by
:formula_1 or by its logarithmic form
:formula_2

where quantities in square brackets represent the molar concentrations of the species at equilibrium.{\gamma_{A^-} \gamma_{H^+}},&lt;/math&gt; is a constant with a value of 1 under a given set of experimental conditions.}} For example, a hypothetical weak acid having &quot;K&quot;a = 10−5, the value of log &quot;K&quot;a is the exponent (−5), giving p&quot;K&quot;a = 5. For acetic acid, &quot;K&quot;a = 1.8 x 10−5, so p&quot;K&quot;a is 4.7. A higher &quot;K&quot;a corresponds to a stronger acid (an acid that is more dissociated at equilibrium). The form p&quot;K&quot;a is often used because it provides a convenient logarithmic scale, where a lower p&quot;K&quot;a corresponds to a stronger acid.

== Theoretical background ==

The acid dissociation constant for an acid is a direct consequence of the underlying thermodynamics of the dissociation reaction; the p&quot;K&quot;a value is directly proportional to the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. The value of the p&quot;K&quot;a changes with temperature and can be understood qualitatively based on Le Châtelier&#x27;s principle: when the reaction is endothermic, &quot;K&quot;a increases and p&quot;K&quot;a decreases with increasing temperature; the opposite is true for exothermic reactions.

The value of p&quot;K&quot;a also depends on molecular structure of the acid in many ways. For example, Pauling proposed two rules: one for successive p&quot;K&quot;a of polyprotic acids (see Polyprotic acids below), and one to estimate the p&quot;K&quot;a of oxyacids based on the number of =O and −OH groups (see Factors that affect p&quot;K&quot;a values below). Other structural factors that influence the magnitude of the acid dissociation constant include inductive effects, mesomeric effects, and hydrogen bonding. Hammett type equations have frequently been applied to the estimation of p&quot;K&quot;a.

The quantitative behaviour of acids and bases in solution can be understood only if their p&quot;K&quot;a values are known. In particular, the pH of a solution can be predicted when the analytical concentration and p&quot;K&quot;a values of all acids and bases are known; conversely, it is possible to calculate the equilibrium concentration of the acids and bases in solution when the pH is known. These calculations find application in many different areas of chemistry, biology, medicine, and geology. For example, many compounds used for medication are weak acids or bases, and a knowledge of the p&quot;K&quot;a values, together with the octanol-water partition coefficient, can be used for estimating the extent to which the compound enters the blood stream. Acid dissociation constants are also essential in aquatic chemistry and chemical oceanography, where the acidity of water plays a fundamental role. In living organisms, acid–base homeostasis and enzyme kinetics are dependent on the p&quot;K&quot;a values of the many acids and bases present in the cell and in the body. In chemistry, a knowledge of p&quot;K&quot;a values is necessary for the preparation of buffer solutions and is also a prerequisite for a quantitative understanding of the interaction between acids or bases and metal ions to form complexes. Experimentally, p&quot;K&quot;a values can be determined by potentiometric (pH) titration, but for values of p&quot;K&quot;a less than about 2 or more than about 11, spectrophotometric or NMR measurements may be required due to practical difficulties with pH measurements.

== Definitions ==
According to Arrhenius&#x27;s original molecular definition, an acid is a substance that dissociates in aqueous solution, releasing the hydrogen ion (a proton):
: &lt;chem&gt;HA &lt;=&gt; A- + H+&lt;/chem&gt;

The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction is known as a dissociation constant. The liberated proton combines with a water molecule to give a hydronium (or oxonium) ion (naked protons do not exist in solution), and so Arrhenius later proposed that the dissociation should be written as an acid–base reaction:
:&lt;chem&gt;HA + H2O &lt;=&gt; A- + H3O+&lt;/chem&gt;

Brønsted and Lowry generalised this further to a proton exchange reaction:
: formula_3

The acid loses a proton, leaving a conjugate base; the proton is transferred to the base, creating a conjugate acid. For aqueous solutions of an acid HA, the base is water; the conjugate base is and the conjugate acid is the hydronium ion. The Brønsted–Lowry definition applies to other solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide: the solvent S acts as a base, accepting a proton and forming the conjugate acid .
:&lt;chem&gt;HA + S &lt;=&gt; A- + SH+&lt;/chem&gt;

In solution chemistry, it is common to use as an abbreviation for the solvated hydrogen ion, regardless of the solvent. In aqueous solution denotes a solvated hydronium ion rather than a proton.

The designation of an acid or base as &quot;conjugate&quot; depends on the context. The conjugate acid of a base B dissociates according to
:&lt;chem&gt;BH+ + OH- &lt;=&gt; B + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

which is the reverse of the equilibrium
:formula_4

The hydroxide ion , a well known base, is here acting as the conjugate base of the acid water. Acids and bases are thus regarded simply as donors and acceptors of protons respectively.

A broader definition of acid dissociation includes hydrolysis, in which protons are produced by the splitting of water molecules. For example, boric acid () produces as if it were a proton donor, but it has been confirmed by Raman spectroscopy that this is due to the hydrolysis equilibrium:
:&lt;chem&gt;B(OH)3 + 2 H2O &lt;=&gt; B(OH)4- + H3O+&lt;/chem&gt;

Similarly, metal ion hydrolysis causes ions such as to behave as weak acids:
: &lt;chem&gt;[Al(H2O)6]^3+ + H2O &lt;=&gt; [Al(H2O)5(OH)]^2+ + H3O+&lt;/chem&gt;

According to Lewis&#x27;s original definition, an acid is a substance that accepts an electron pair to form a coordinate covalent bond.

== Equilibrium constant ==
An acid dissociation constant is a particular example of an equilibrium constant. The dissociation of a monoprotic acid, HA, in dilute solution can be written as
: &lt;chem&gt;HA &lt;=&gt; A- + H+&lt;/chem&gt;

The thermodynamic equilibrium constant can be defined by
:formula_5

where formula_6 represents the activity, at equilibrium, of the chemical species X. formula_7 is dimensionless since activity is dimensionless. Activities of the products of dissociation are placed in the numerator, activities of the reactants are placed in the denominator. See activity coefficient for a derivation of this expression.

Since activity is the product of concentration and activity coefficient (&quot;γ&quot;) the definition could also be written as
:formula_8
where formula_9 represents the concentration of HA and is a quotient of activity coefficients.

To avoid the complications involved in using activities, dissociation constants are determined, where possible, in a medium of high ionic strength, that is, under conditions in which can be assumed to be always constant. For example, the medium might be a solution of 0.1 molar (M) sodium nitrate or 3 M potassium perchlorate. With this assumption,
:formula_10
:formula_11
is obtained. Note, however, that all published dissociation constant values refer to the specific ionic medium used in their determination and that different values are obtained with different conditions, as shown for acetic acid in the illustration above. When published constants refer to an ionic strength other than the one required for a particular application, they may be adjusted by means of specific ion theory (SIT) and other theories.

===Cumulative and stepwise constants===
A cumulative equilibrium constant, denoted by is related to the product of stepwise constants, denoted by For a dibasic acid the relationship between stepwise and overall constants is as follows
:&lt;chem&gt;H2A &lt;=&gt; A^2- + 2H+&lt;/chem&gt;
:formula_12
:formula_13

Note that in the context of metal-ligand complex formation, the equilibrium constants for the formation of metal complexes are usually defined as &quot;association&quot; constants. In that case, the equilibrium constants for ligand protonation are also defined as association constants. The numbering of association constants is the reverse of the numbering of dissociation constants; in this example formula_14

=== Association and dissociation constants ===
When discussing the properties of acids it is usual to specify equilibrium constants as acid dissociation constants, denoted by &quot;K&quot;a, with numerical values given the symbol p&quot;K&quot;a.
:formula_15

On the other hand, association constants are used for bases. 
:formula_16

However, general purpose computer programs that are used to derive equilibrium constant values from experimental data use association constants for both acids and bases. Because stability constants for a metal-ligand complex are always specified as association constants, ligand protonation must also be specified as an association reaction. The definitions show that the value of an acid dissociation constant is the reciprocal of the value of the corresponding association constant:
: formula_17
: formula_18
: formula_19

Notes
# For a given acid or base in water, , the self-ionization constant of water.
# The association constant for the formation of a supramolecular complex may be denoted as Ka; in such cases &quot;a&quot; stands for &quot;association&quot;, not &quot;acid&quot;.
# For polyprotic acids, the numbering of stepwise association constants is the reverse of the numbering of the dissociation constants. For example, for phosphoric acid (details in the polyprotic acids section below):
::formula_20

=== Temperature dependence ===
All equilibrium constants vary with temperature according to the van &#x27;t Hoff equation
:formula_21

 is the gas constant and is the absolute temperature. Thus, for exothermic reactions, the standard enthalpy change, , is negative and &quot;K&quot; decreases with temperature. For endothermic reactions, is positive and &quot;K&quot; increases with temperature.

The standard enthalpy change for a reaction is itself a function of temperature, according to Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermochemistry:
:formula_22
where is the heat capacity change at constant pressure. In practice may be taken to be constant over a small temperature range.

===Dimensionality===
In the equation
:formula_23

&quot;K&quot;a appears to have dimensions of concentration. However, since formula_24, the equilibrium constant, , &quot;cannot&quot; have a physical dimension. This apparent paradox can be resolved in various ways. 
# Assume that the quotient of activity coefficients has a numerical value of 1, so that has the same numerical value as the thermodynamic equilibrium constant formula_7.
# Express each concentration value as the ratio c/c0, where c0 is the concentration in a [hypothetical] standard state, with a numerical value of 1, by definition. 
# Express the concentrations on the mole fraction scale. Since mole fraction has no dimension, the quotient of concentrations will, by definition, be a pure number.

The procedures, (1) and (2), give identical numerical values for an equilibrium constant. Furthermore, since a concentration is simply proportional to mole fraction and density :
:formula_26
and since the molar mass is a constant in dilute solutions, an equilibrium constant value determined using (3) will be simply proportional to the values obtained with (1) and (2).

It is common practice in biochemistry to quote a value with a dimension as, for example, &quot;&quot;K&quot;a = 30 mM&quot; in order to indicate the scale, millimolar (mM) or micromolar (μM) of the concentration values used for its calculation.

== Strong acids and bases ==
An acid is classified as &quot;strong&quot; when the concentration of its undissociated species is too low to be measured. Any aqueous acid with a p&quot;K&quot;a value of less than 0 is almost completely deprotonated and is considered a &quot;strong acid&quot;. All such acids transfer their protons to water and form the solvent cation species (H3O+ in aqueous solution) so that they all have essentially the same acidity, a phenomenon known as solvent leveling. They are said to be &quot;fully dissociated&quot; in aqueous solution because the amount of undissociated acid, in equilibrium with the dissociation products, is below the detection limit. Likewise, any aqueous base with an association constant p&quot;K&quot;b less than about 0, corresponding to p&quot;K&quot;a greater than about 14, is leveled to OH− and is considered a &quot;strong base&quot;.

Nitric acid, with a p&quot;K&quot; value of around −1.7, behaves as a strong acid in aqueous solutions with a pH greater than 1. At lower pH values it behaves as a weak acid.

p&quot;K&quot;a values for strong acids have been estimated by theoretical means. For example, the p&quot;K&quot;a value of aqueous HCl has been estimated as −9.3.

== Monoprotic acids ==

After rearranging the expression defining &quot;K&quot;a, and putting , one obtains

:formula_27

This is the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, from which the following conclusions can be drawn.
* At half-neutralization the ratio ; since , the pH at half-neutralization is numerically equal to p&quot;K&quot;a. Conversely, when , the concentration of HA is equal to the concentration of A−.
* The buffer region extends over the approximate range p&quot;K&quot;a ± 2. Buffering is weak outside the range p&quot;K&quot;a ± 1. At pH ≤ p&quot;K&quot;a − 2 the substance is said to be fully protonated and at pH ≥ p&quot;K&quot;a + 2 it is fully dissociated (deprotonated).
* If the pH is known, the ratio may be calculated. This ratio is independent of the analytical concentration of the acid.

In water, measurable p&quot;K&quot;a values range from about −2 for a strong acid to about 12 for a very weak acid (or strong base).

A buffer solution of a desired pH can be prepared as a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base. In practice, the mixture can be created by dissolving the acid in water, and adding the requisite amount of strong acid or base. When the p&quot;K&quot;a and analytical concentration of the acid are known, the extent of dissociation and pH of a solution of a monoprotic acid can be easily calculated using an ICE table.

== Polyprotic acids ==
A polyprotic acid is a compound which may lose more than 1 proton. Stepwise dissociation constants are each defined for the loss of a single proton. The constant for dissociation of the first proton may be denoted as &quot;K&quot;a1 and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as &quot;K&quot;a2, etc. Phosphoric acid, , is an example of a polyprotic acid as it can lose three protons.

When the difference between successive p&quot;K&quot; values is about four or more, as in this example, each species may be considered as an acid in its own right; In fact salts of may be crystallised from solution by adjustment of pH to about 5.5 and salts of may be crystallised from solution by adjustment of pH to about 10. The species distribution diagram shows that the concentrations of the two ions are maximum at pH 5.5 and 10.

When the difference between successive p&quot;K&quot; values is less than about four there is overlap between the pH range of existence of the species in equilibrium. The smaller the difference, the more the overlap. The case of citric acid is shown at the right; solutions of citric acid are buffered over the whole range of pH 2.5 to 7.5.

According to Pauling&#x27;s first rule, successive p&quot;K&quot; values of a given acid increase . For oxyacids with more than one ionizable hydrogen on the same atom, the p&quot;K&quot;a values often increase by about 5 units for each proton removed, as in the example of phosphoric acid above.

It can be seen in the table above that the second proton is removed from a negatively charged species. Since the proton carries a positive charge extra work is needed to remove it, which is why p&quot;K&quot;a2 is greater than p&quot;K&quot;a1. p&quot;K&quot;a3 is greater than p&quot;K&quot;a2 because there is further charge separation. When an exception to Pauling&#x27;s rule is found, it indicates that a major change in structure is also occurring. In the case of (aq), the vanadium is octahedral, 6-coordinate, whereas vanadic acid is tetrahedral, 4-coordinate. This means that four &quot;particles&quot; are released with the first dissociation, but only two &quot;particles&quot; are released with the other dissociations, resulting in a much greater entropy contribution to the standard Gibbs free energy change for the first reaction than for the others.

=== Isoelectric point ===

For substances in solution, the isoelectric point (p&quot;I&quot;) is defined as the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of negatively charged species. In the case that there is one species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the p&quot;K&quot; values. Take the example of glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.
: &lt;chem&gt;AH2+ &lt;=&gt; AH~+ H+ \qquad [AH][H+] = \mathit{K}_1 [AH2+]&lt;/chem&gt;
: &lt;chem&gt;AH &lt;=&gt; A^-~+H+ \qquad [A^- ][H+] = \mathit{K}_2 [AH]&lt;/chem&gt;

Substitute the expression for [AH] from the second equation into the first equation
: &lt;chem&gt;[A^- ][H+]^2 = \mathit{K}_1 \mathit{K}_2 [AH2+]&lt;/chem&gt;

At the isoelectric point the concentration of the positively charged species, , is equal to the concentration of the negatively charged species, , so
: formula_28

Therefore, taking cologarithms, the pH is given by
: formula_29

p&quot;I&quot; values for amino acids are listed at proteinogenic amino acid. When more than two charged species are in equilibrium with each other a full speciation calculation may be needed.

== Bases and basicity ==
The equilibrium constant &quot;K&quot;b for a base is usually defined as the &quot;association&quot; constant for protonation of the base, B, to form the conjugate acid, .
: &lt;chem&gt;B + H2O &lt;=&gt; HB+ + OH-&lt;/chem&gt;

Using similar reasoning to that used before
: formula_30

&quot;K&quot;b is related to &quot;K&quot;a for the conjugate acid. In water, the concentration of the hydroxide ion, , is related to the concentration of the hydrogen ion by , therefore
: formula_31

Substitution of the expression for into the expression for &quot;K&quot;b gives
: formula_32

When &quot;K&quot;a, &quot;K&quot;b and &quot;K&quot;w are determined under the same conditions of temperature and ionic strength, it follows, taking cologarithms, that p&quot;K&quot;b = p&quot;K&quot;w − p&quot;K&quot;a. In aqueous solutions at 25 °C, p&quot;K&quot;w is 13.9965, so
:formula_33

with sufficient accuracy for most practical purposes. In effect there is no need to define p&quot;K&quot;b separately from p&quot;K&quot;a, but it is done here as often only p&quot;K&quot;b values can be found in the older literature.

For an hydrolyzed metal ion, &quot;K&quot;b can also be defined as a stepwise &quot;dissociation&quot; constant
: formula_34
: formula_35

This is the reciprocal of an association constant for formation of the complex.

=== Basicity expressed as dissociation constant of conjugate acid ===
Because the relationship p&quot;K&quot;b = p&quot;K&quot;w − p&quot;K&quot;a holds only in aqueous solutions (though analogous relationships apply for other amphoteric solvents), subdisciplines of chemistry like organic chemistry that usually deal with nonaqueous solutions generally do not use p&quot;K&quot;b as a measure of basicity. Instead, the p&quot;K&quot;a of the conjugate acid, denoted by p&quot;K&quot;aH, is quoted when basicity needs to be quantified. For base B and its conjugate acid BH+ in equilibrium, this is defined as
: formula_36

A higher value for p&quot;K&quot;aH corresponds to a stronger base. For example, the values and indicate that (triethylamine) is a stronger base than (pyridine).

== Amphoteric substances ==
An amphoteric substance is one that can act as an acid or as a base, depending on pH. Water (below) is amphoteric. Another example of an amphoteric molecule is the bicarbonate ion that is the conjugate base of the carbonic acid molecule H2CO3 in the equilibrium
:&lt;chem&gt;H2CO3 + H2O &lt;=&gt; HCO3- + H3O+&lt;/chem&gt;

but also the conjugate acid of the carbonate ion in (the reverse of) the equilibrium
:&lt;chem&gt;HCO3- + OH- &lt;=&gt; CO3^2- + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
Carbonic acid equilibria are important for acid–base homeostasis in the human body.

An amino acid is also amphoteric with the added complication that the neutral molecule is subject to an internal acid–base equilibrium in which the basic amino group attracts and binds the proton from the acidic carboxyl group, forming a zwitterion.
: &lt;chem&gt;NH2CHRCO2H &lt;=&gt; NH3+CHRCO2-&lt;/chem&gt;

At pH less than about 5 both the carboxylate group and the amino group are protonated. As pH increases the acid dissociates according to
: &lt;chem&gt;NH3+CHRCO2H &lt;=&gt; NH3+CHRCO2- + H+&lt;/chem&gt;

At high pH a second dissociation may take place.
: &lt;chem&gt;NH3+CHRCO2- &lt;=&gt; NH2CHRCO2- + H+&lt;/chem&gt;

Thus the amino acid molecule is amphoteric because it may either be protonated or deprotonated.

=== Water self-ionization ===

The water molecule may either gain or lose a proton. It is said to be amphiprotic. The ionization equilibrium can be written
: &lt;chem&gt;H2O &lt;=&gt; OH- + H+&lt;/chem&gt;

where in aqueous solution denotes a solvated proton. Often this is written as the hydronium ion , but this formula is not exact because in fact there is solvation by more than one water molecule and species such as , , and are also present.

The equilibrium constant is given by
:formula_37

With solutions in which the solute concentrations are not very high, the concentration can be assumed to be constant, regardless of solute(s); this expression may then be replaced by
:formula_38

The self-ionization constant of water, &quot;K&quot;w, is thus just a special case of an acid dissociation constant. A logarithmic form analogous to p&quot;K&quot;a may also be defined
:formula_39

These data can be modelled by a parabola with
: formula_40

From this equation, p&quot;K&quot;w = 14 at 24.87 °C. At that temperature both hydrogen and hydroxide ions have a concentration of 10−7 M.

== Acidity in nonaqueous solutions ==
A solvent will be more likely to promote ionization of a dissolved acidic molecule in the following circumstances:
# It is a protic solvent, capable of forming hydrogen bonds.
# It has a high donor number, making it a strong Lewis base.
# It has a high dielectric constant (relative permittivity), making it a good solvent for ionic species.
p&quot;K&quot;a values of organic compounds are often obtained using the aprotic solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and acetonitrile (ACN).

DMSO is widely used as an alternative to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable p&quot;K&quot;a range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some p&quot;K&quot;a values at 25 °C for acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.

Ionization of acids is less in an acidic solvent than in water. For example, hydrogen chloride is a weak acid when dissolved in acetic acid. This is because acetic acid is a much weaker base than water.
: &lt;chem&gt;HCl + CH3CO2H &lt;=&gt; Cl- + CH3C(OH)2+&lt;/chem&gt;
: formula_3

Compare this reaction with what happens when acetic acid is dissolved in the more acidic solvent pure sulfuric acid:
:&lt;chem&gt;H2SO4 + CH3CO2H &lt;=&gt; HSO4- + CH3C(OH)2+&lt;/chem&gt;
The unlikely geminal diol species is stable in these environments. For aqueous solutions the pH scale is the most convenient acidity function. Other acidity functions have been proposed for non-aqueous media, the most notable being the Hammett acidity function, &quot;H&quot;0, for superacid media and its modified version &quot;H&quot;− for superbasic media.

In aprotic solvents, oligomers, such as the well-known acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, has the effect of enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective p&quot;K&quot;a values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800.

In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.

=== Mixed solvents ===
When a compound has limited solubility in water it is common practice (in the pharmaceutical industry, for example) to determine p&quot;K&quot;a values in a solvent mixture such as water/dioxane or water/methanol, in which the compound is more soluble. In the example shown at the right, the p&quot;K&quot;a value rises steeply with increasing percentage of dioxane as the dielectric constant of the mixture is decreasing.

A p&quot;K&quot;a value obtained in a mixed solvent cannot be used directly for aqueous solutions. The reason for this is that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is &quot;defined&quot; as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane mixture with 9:1 mixing ratio is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the p&quot;K&quot;a value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.

These facts are obscured by the omission of the solvent from the expression that is normally used to define p&quot;K&quot;a, but p&quot;K&quot;a values obtained in a &quot;given&quot; mixed solvent can be compared to each other, giving relative acid strengths. The same is true of p&quot;K&quot;a values obtained in a particular non-aqueous solvent such a DMSO.

A universal, solvent-independent, scale for acid dissociation constants has not been developed, since there is no known way to compare the standard states of two different solvents.

== Factors that affect p&quot;K&quot;a values ==
Pauling&#x27;s second rule is that the value of the first p&quot;K&quot;a for acids of the formula XO&quot;m&quot;(OH)&quot;n&quot; depends primarily on the number of oxo groups &quot;m&quot;, and is approximately independent of the number of hydroxy groups &quot;n&quot;, and also of the central atom X. Approximate values of p&quot;K&quot;a are 8 for &quot;m&quot; = 0, 2 for &quot;m&quot; = 1, −3 for &quot;m&quot; = 2 and &lt; −10 for &quot;m&quot; = 3. Alternatively, various numerical formulas have been proposed including p&quot;K&quot;a = 8 − 5&quot;m&quot; (known as Bell&#x27;s rule), p&quot;K&quot;a = 7 − 5&quot;m&quot;, or p&quot;K&quot;a = 9 − 7&quot;m&quot;. The dependence on &quot;m&quot; correlates with the oxidation state of the central atom, X: the higher the oxidation state the stronger the oxyacid.

For example, p&quot;K&quot;a for HClO is 7.2, for HClO2 is 2.0, for HClO3 is −1 and HClO4 is a strong acid (). The increased acidity on adding an oxo group is due to stabilization of the conjugate base by delocalization of its negative charge over an additional oxygen atom. This rule can help assign molecular structure: for example, phosphorous acid, having molecular formula H3PO3, has a p&quot;K&quot;a near 2, which suggested that the structure is HPO(OH)2, as later confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and not P(OH)3, which would be expected to have a p&quot;K&quot;a near 8.

Inductive effects and mesomeric effects affect the p&quot;K&quot;a values. A simple example is provided by the effect of replacing the hydrogen atoms in acetic acid by the more electronegative chlorine atom. The electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent makes ionisation easier, so successive p&quot;K&quot;a values decrease in the series 4.7, 2.8, 1.4, and 0.7 when 0, 1, 2, or 3 chlorine atoms are present. The Hammett equation, provides a general expression for the effect of substituents.
: log(&quot;K&quot;a) = log(&quot;K&quot;) + ρσ.

&quot;K&quot;a is the dissociation constant of a substituted compound, &quot;K&quot; is the dissociation constant when the substituent is hydrogen, ρ is a property of the unsubstituted compound and σ has a particular value for each substituent. A plot of log(&quot;K&quot;a) against σ is a straight line with intercept log(&quot;K&quot;) and slope ρ. This is an example of a linear free energy relationship as log(&quot;K&quot;a) is proportional to the standard free energy change. Hammett originally formulated the relationship with data from benzoic acid with different substituents in the &quot;ortho-&quot; and &quot;para-&quot; positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation. This and other studies allowed substituents to be ordered according to their electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing power, and to distinguish between inductive and mesomeric effects.

Alcohols do not normally behave as acids in water, but the presence of a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the p&quot;K&quot;a by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.

Structural effects can also be important. The difference between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a &quot;trans&quot; isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding &quot;cis&quot; isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism). Fumaric acid has p&quot;K&quot;a values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has p&quot;K&quot;a values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference is that when one proton is removed from the &quot;cis&quot; isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the maleate H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the &quot;trans&quot; isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.

Proton sponge, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene, has a p&quot;K&quot;a value of 12.1. It is one of the strongest amine bases known. The high basicity is attributed to the relief of strain upon protonation and strong internal hydrogen bonding.

Effects of the solvent and solvation should be mentioned also in this section. It turns out, these influences are more subtle than that of a dielectric medium mentioned above. For example, the expected (by electronic effects of methyl substituents) and observed in gas phase order of basicity of methylamines, Me3N &gt; Me2NH &gt; MeNH2 &gt; NH3, is changed by water to Me2NH &gt; MeNH2 &gt; Me3N &gt; NH3. Neutral methylamine molecules are hydrogen-bonded to water molecules mainly through one acceptor, N–HOH, interaction and only occasionally just one more donor bond, NH–OH2. Hence, methylamines are stabilized to about the same extent by hydration, regardless of the number of methyl groups. In stark contrast, corresponding methylammonium cations always utilize all the available protons for donor NH–OH2 bonding. Relative stabilization of methylammonium ions thus decreases with the number of methyl groups explaining the order of water basicity of methylamines.

=== Thermodynamics ===
An equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction, so for an acid dissociation constant
: formula_42.

&quot;R&quot; is the gas constant and &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature. Note that and . At 25 °C, Δ&quot;G&quot; in kJ·mol−1 ≈ 5.708 p&quot;K&quot;a (1 kJ·mol−1 = 1000 joules per mole). Free energy is made up of an enthalpy term and an entropy term.
:formula_43

The standard enthalpy change can be determined by calorimetry or by using the van &#x27;t Hoff equation, though the calorimetric method is preferable. When both the standard enthalpy change and acid dissociation constant have been determined, the standard entropy change is easily calculated from the equation above. In the following table, the entropy terms are calculated from the experimental values of p&quot;K&quot;a and Δ&quot;H&quot;. The data were critically selected and refer to 25 °C and zero ionic strength, in water.


The first point to note is that, when p&quot;K&quot;a is positive, the standard free energy change for the dissociation reaction is also positive. Second, some reactions are exothermic and some are endothermic, but, when Δ&quot;H&quot; is negative &quot;T&quot;ΔS is the dominant factor, which determines that Δ&quot;G&quot; is positive. Last, the entropy contribution is always unfavourable () in these reactions. Ions in aqueous solution tend to orient the surrounding water molecules, which orders the solution and decreases the entropy. The contribution of an ion to the entropy is the partial molar entropy which is often negative, especially for small or highly charged ions. The ionization of a neutral acid involves formation of two ions so that the entropy decreases (). On the second ionization of the same acid, there are now three ions and the anion has a charge, so the entropy again decreases.

Note that the &quot;standard&quot; free energy change for the reaction is for the changes &quot;from&quot; the reactants in their standard states &quot;to&quot; the products in their standard states. The free energy change &quot;at&quot; equilibrium is zero since the chemical potentials of reactants and products are equal at equilibrium.

== Experimental determination ==

The experimental determination of p&quot;K&quot;a values is commonly performed by means of titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid to the point where the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.

The total volume of added strong base should be small compared to the initial volume of titrand solution in order to keep the ionic strength nearly constant. This will ensure that p&quot;K&quot;a remains invariant during the titration.

A calculated titration curve for oxalic acid is shown at the right. Oxalic acid has p&quot;K&quot;a values of 1.27 and 4.27. Therefore, the buffer regions will be centered at about pH 1.3 and pH 4.3. The buffer regions carry the information necessary to get the p&quot;K&quot;a values as the concentrations of acid and conjugate base change along a buffer region.

Between the two buffer regions there is an end-point, or equivalence point, at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is typical of a diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap by a small amount: p&quot;K&quot;a2 − p&quot;K&quot;a1 is about three in this example. (If the difference in p&quot;K&quot; values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point begins at about pH 6.3 and is sharp. This indicates that all the protons have been removed. When this is so, the solution is not buffered and the pH rises steeply on addition of a small amount of strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new buffer region begins at about pH 11 (p&quot;K&quot;w − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.

It is very difficult to measure pH values of less than two in aqueous solution with a glass electrode, because the Nernst equation breaks down at such low pH values. To determine p&quot;K&quot; values of less than about 2 or more than about 11 spectrophotometric or NMR measurements may be used instead of, or combined with, pH measurements.

When the glass electrode cannot be employed, as with non-aqueous solutions, spectrophotometric methods are frequently used. These may involve absorbance or fluorescence measurements. In both cases the measured quantity is assumed to be proportional to the sum of contributions from each photo-active species; with absorbance measurements the Beer–Lambert law is assumed to apply.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) may be used to determine both a p&quot;K&quot; value and the corresponding standard enthalpy for acid dissociation. Software to perform the calculations is supplied by the instrument manufacturers for simple systems.

Aqueous solutions with normal water cannot be used for 1H NMR measurements but heavy water, , must be used instead. 13C NMR data, however, can be used with normal water and 1H NMR spectra can be used with non-aqueous media. The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts, as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, such as those of 31P can be measured.

=== Micro-constants ===

For some polyprotic acids, dissociation (or association) occurs at more than one nonequivalent site, and the observed macroscopic equilibrium constant, or macro-constant, is a combination of micro-constants involving distinct species. When one reactant forms two products in parallel, the macro-constant is a sum of two micro-constants, formula_44 This is true for example for the deprotonation of the amino acid cysteine, which exists in solution as a neutral zwitterion . The two micro-constants represent deprotonation either at sulphur or at nitrogen, and the macro-constant sum here is the acid dissociation constant formula_45

Similarly, a base such as spermine has more than one site where protonation can occur. For example, mono-protonation can occur at a terminal group or at internal groups. The &quot;K&quot;b values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements; a measured &quot;K&quot;b value is the sum of the K values for the micro-reactions.
: formula_46

Nevertheless, the site of protonation is very important for biological function, so mathematical methods have been developed for the determination of micro-constants.

When two reactants form a single product in parallel, the macro-constant formula_47 For example, the abovementioned equilibrium for spermine may be considered in terms of &quot;K&quot;a values of two tautomeric conjugate acids, with macro-constant In this case formula_48 This is equivalent to the preceding expression since formula_49 is proportional to formula_50

When a reactant undergoes two reactions in series, the macro-constant for the combined reaction is the product of the micro-constant for the two steps. For example, the abovementioned cysteine zwitterion can lose two protons, one from sulphur and one from nitrogen, and the overall macro-constant for losing two protons is the product of two dissociation constants formula_51 This can also be written in terms of logarithmic constants as formula_52

== Applications and significance ==
A knowledge of p&quot;K&quot;a values is important for the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the p&quot;K&quot;a values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein p&quot;K&quot;a values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a knowledge of the p&quot;K&quot;a values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering is an essential part of acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base disorder. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its p&quot;K&quot; values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Buffer solutions also play a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH = p&quot;K&quot;a. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.

A pH indicator is a weak acid or weak base that changes colour in the transition pH range, which is approximately p&quot;K&quot;a ± 1. The design of a universal indicator requires a mixture of indicators whose adjacent p&quot;K&quot;a values differ by about two, so that their transition pH ranges just overlap.

In pharmacology, ionization of a compound alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and lipophilicity, log &quot;p&quot;). For example, ionization of any compound will increase the solubility in water, but decrease the lipophilicity. This is exploited in drug development to increase the concentration of a compound in the blood by adjusting the p&quot;K&quot;a of an ionizable group.

Knowledge of p&quot;K&quot;a values is important for the understanding of coordination complexes, which are formed by the interaction of a metal ion, Mm+, acting as a Lewis acid, with a ligand, L, acting as a Lewis base. However, the ligand may also undergo protonation reactions, so the formation of a complex in aqueous solution could be represented symbolically by the reaction
:formula_53

To determine the equilibrium constant for this reaction, in which the ligand loses a proton, the p&quot;K&quot;a of the protonated ligand must be known. In practice, the ligand may be polyprotic; for example EDTA4− can accept four protons; in that case, all p&quot;K&quot;a values must be known. In addition, the metal ion is subject to hydrolysis, that is, it behaves as a weak acid, so the p&quot;K&quot; values for the hydrolysis reactions must also be known.

Assessing the hazard associated with an acid or base may require a knowledge of p&quot;K&quot;a values. For example, hydrogen cyanide is a very toxic gas, because the cyanide ion inhibits the iron-containing enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Hydrogen cyanide is a weak acid in aqueous solution with a p&quot;K&quot;a of about 9. In strongly alkaline solutions, above pH 11, say, it follows that sodium cyanide is &quot;fully dissociated&quot; so the hazard due to the hydrogen cyanide gas is much reduced. An acidic solution, on the other hand, is very hazardous because all the cyanide is in its acid form. Ingestion of cyanide by mouth is potentially fatal, independently of pH, because of the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase.

In environmental science acid–base equilibria are important for lakes and rivers; for example, humic acids are important components of natural waters. Another example occurs in chemical oceanography: in order to quantify the solubility of iron(III) in seawater at various salinities, the p&quot;K&quot;a values for the formation of the iron(III) hydrolysis products , and were determined, along with the solubility product of iron hydroxide.

== Values for common substances ==
There are multiple techniques to determine the p&quot;K&quot;a of a chemical, leading to some discrepancies between different sources. Well measured values are typically within 0.1 units of each other. Data presented here were taken at 25 °C in water. More values can be found in the Thermodynamics section, above. A table of p&quot;K&quot;a of carbon acids, measured in DMSO, can be found on the page on carbanions.

<text>The Cocopah (Cocopah: Xawiƚƚ Kwñchawaay) are Native Americans who live in Baja California, Mexico, and Arizona, United States.

In the United States, Cocopah people belong to the federally recognized Cocopah Tribe of Arizona.

== Name ==
The Cocopah are also called the Cucapá (in Cocopa: Kwapa or Kwii Capáy).

== Language ==
The Cocopah language belongs to the Delta–California branch of the Yuman family. Their self-designation is Xawiƚƚ kwñchawaay, translating to “Those Who Live on the Cloudy River” (from &quot;Xawíƚƚy&quot; - &quot;river&quot;, &quot;kwii&quot; - &quot;cloud&quot;, &quot;(ny)way&quot; - &quot;to live&quot;, &quot;llyay/nyaam&quot; - &quot;many&quot;). According to the U.S. Census, there were 1,009 Cocopah in 2010.

Alternate spellings of Cocopah in Spanish documents include: Cócopa, Cócapa, Cócope, Cósopa, Cúcapa.

==History==
===Precontact===
Ancestors of the Cocopah inhabited parts of present-day Arizona, California, and Baja California and are known by western academics as belonging to the Patayan culture. Patayan is a term used by archaeologists to describe prehistoric Native American cultures who inhabited parts of modern-day Arizona, west to Lake Cahuilla in California, and in Baja California, between 700 and 1550 A.D. This included areas along the Gila River, Colorado River and in the Lower Colorado River Valley, the nearby uplands, and north to the vicinity of the Grand Canyon. They are mostly likely ancestors of the Cocopah and other Yuman-speaking tribes in the region. The Patayan peoples practiced floodplain agriculture where possible and relied heavily on hunting and gathering.

===Post-contact===
The first significant contact of the Cocopah with Europeans and Africans probably occurred in 1540, when the Spanish explorer Hernando de Alarcón sailed into the Colorado River delta. The Cocopah were specifically mentioned by name by the expedition of Juan de Oñate in 1605.

====Post-Mexican cession====
After the Mexican-American War, Cocopah lands were split between the U.S. and Mexico through the Mexican Cession resulting from the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

Westward expansion in the 1840s and the discovery of gold in California in 1849 brought many migrants through the area near the mouth of the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon region. The strategic importance of the river crossing was recognized by the U.S. government, and the United States Army established Camp Independence in 1850 to protect the entry route through the tribe&#x27;s territories. Many tribes along the Colorado River entered the ferry business given its profitability, creating many jobs for the Cocopah.

The Cocopah agreed to join Garra&#x27;s Tax Revolt of 1851, led by the Cupeño, to fight against the U.S. government alongside the Quechan and nearby Kumeyaay bands. Together, the Cocopah sieged Camp Independence but the siege fell apart after disputes with the Quechan over the distribution of sheep confiscated from white sheepherders earlier.

The Cocopah also entered the Yuma War following the tax revolt initially on the side of the Quechan against the U.S. After making peace with the U.S., the Cocopah allied with the Paipai and Halyikwamai and turned against the Quechan, after accumulating tension between the two tribes. War broke out in May 1853, when the Cocopah besieged three Quechan villages holding them hostage. In retaliation, the Quechan-allied Mohave backed the Quechan and raided the Cocopah. The Yuma War came to an end when the U.S. threatened the Mojave that they would intervene on the side of the Cocopah.

====Cocopah in the Mexican Revolution====
During the Mexican Revolution, the Magonistas gained the support of the Cocopah, under the influence of Camilo Jiménez, who was the tribal leader of the Cocopah in the Mexicali Valley. The Cocopah were sympathetic of the Magonist struggle against imperialism from both Mexico and the U.S., and the privatized ownership of their land. The Cocopah were joined by the Paipai, Kiliwa, and Kumeyaay, and prepared to fight alongside the Magonistas, as Jiménez smuggled US arms to Mexico with the support of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).

On January 29, the Magonistas and the Cocopah captured Mexicali and provided further logistical support throughout their lands. Jiménez carried out a campaign with the Cocopah, Paipai, and Kiliwa armies from El Rosario to Ensenada, raiding small towns and looting Chinese-Mexican businesses.

The Cocopah were eventually defeated by the Mexican forces in the following months and were forced off of their land by the Colorado River Land Company.

====Modern era====
In 1964, the Cocopah Tribe of Arizona, on the U.S. side of the border, ratified its first constitution and formed a five-person Tribal Council in the Cocopah Indian Reservation. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the tribe acquired additional land, constructed homes, installed utilities, developed infrastructure, and initiated economic development.

==Cocopah Tribe of Arizona==

Cocopah peoples in the United States are enrolled in the Cocopah Tribe of Arizona. As of the 2000 United States Census, the Cocopah Tribe of Arizona numbered 891 people. There is a casino, speedway, resort, family entertainment center and bingo hall on the reservation as well as a Museum and Cultural Center. Another Yuman group, the Quechan, lives in the adjacent Fort Yuma Indian Reservation. On important occasions, Cocopah people wear their customary ribbon shirts and ribbon dresses.
== Settlements ==
Cocopah people live in Mexicali Municipality, Baja California (settlements of Campo Camerina (Colonia Terrenos Indios), Campo del Prado (Colonia el Mayor), Campo Flores, Campo Sonora (Colonia Terrenos Indios), Colonia la Puerta, Comunidad Indígena Cucapá el Mayor [Ejido el Mayor], Ejido Cucapá Mestizo, Ejido Doctor Alberto Mota (El Indiviso), Ejido Durango, Ejido México, Familia Regalado (Ejido Sonora 2 Campos Nuevos), La Casa de las Curvas (Colonia el Mayor), Mexicali, Sainz Domínguez (Colonia el Mayor), and San Felipe) and San Luis Río Colorado Municipality, Sonora (settlements of Pozas de Arvizu (La Reserva), and San Luis Río Colorado), Mexico, and in Somerton, Arizona in the United States.

<text>Predation is a biological interaction in which one organism, the predator, kills and eats another organism, its prey. It is one of a family of common feeding behaviours that includes parasitism and micropredation (which usually do not kill the host) and parasitoidism (which always does, eventually). It is distinct from scavenging on dead prey, though many predators also scavenge; it overlaps with herbivory, as seed predators and destructive frugivores are predators.

Predation behavior varies significantly depending on the organism. Many predators, especially carnivores, have evolved distinct hunting strategies. Pursuit predation involves the active search for and pursuit of prey, whilst ambush predators instead wait for prey to present an opportunity for capture, and often use stealth or aggressive mimicry. Other predators are opportunistic or omnivorous and only practice predation occasionally.

Most obligate carnivores are specialized for hunting. They may have acute senses such as vision, hearing, or smell for prey detection. Many predatory animals have sharp claws or jaws to grip, kill, and cut up their prey. Physical strength is usually necessary for large carnivores such as big cats to kill larger prey. Other adaptations include stealth, endurance, intelligence, social behaviour, and aggressive mimicry that improve hunting efficiency.

Predation has a powerful selective effect on prey, and the prey develops anti-predator adaptations such as warning colouration, alarm calls and other signals, camouflage, mimicry of well-defended species, and defensive spines and chemicals. Sometimes predator and prey find themselves in an evolutionary arms race, a cycle of adaptations and counter-adaptations. Predation has been a major driver of evolution since at least the Cambrian period.

==Definition==
At the most basic level, predators kill and eat other organisms. However, the concept of predation is broad, defined differently in different contexts, and includes a wide variety of feeding methods; moreover, some relationships that result in the prey&#x27;s death are not necessarily called predation. A parasitoid, such as an ichneumon wasp, lays its eggs in or on its host; the eggs hatch into larvae, which eat the host, and it inevitably dies. Zoologists generally call this a form of parasitism, though conventionally parasites are thought not to kill their hosts. A predator can be defined to differ from a parasitoid in that it has many prey, captured over its lifetime, where a parasitoid&#x27;s larva has just one, or at least has its food supply provisioned for it on just one occasion.

There are other difficult and borderline cases. Micropredators are small animals that, like predators, feed entirely on other organisms; they include fleas and mosquitoes that consume blood from living animals, and aphids that consume sap from living plants. However, since they typically do not kill their hosts, they are now often thought of as parasites. Animals that graze on phytoplankton or mats of microbes are predators, as they consume and kill their food organisms, while herbivores that browse leaves are not, as their food plants usually survive the assault. When animals eat seeds (&quot;seed predation&quot; or &quot;granivory&quot;) or eggs (&quot;egg predation&quot;), they are consuming entire living organisms, which by definition makes them predators.

Scavengers, organisms that only eat organisms found already dead, are not predators, but many predators such as the jackal and the hyena scavenge when the opportunity arises. Among invertebrates, social wasps such as yellowjackets are both hunters and scavengers of other insects.

==Taxonomic range==


While examples of predators among mammals and birds are well known, predators can be found in a broad range of taxa including arthropods. They are common among insects, including mantids, dragonflies, lacewings and scorpionflies. In some species such as the alderfly, only the larvae are predatory (the adults do not eat). Spiders are predatory, as well as other terrestrial invertebrates such as scorpions; centipedes; some mites, snails and slugs; nematodes; and planarian worms. In marine environments, most cnidarians (e.g., jellyfish, hydroids), ctenophora (comb jellies), echinoderms (e.g., sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers) and flatworms are predatory. Among crustaceans, lobsters, crabs, shrimps and barnacles are predators, and in turn crustaceans are preyed on by nearly all cephalopods (including octopuses, squid and cuttlefish).

Seed predation is restricted to mammals, birds, and insects but is found in almost all terrestrial ecosystems. Egg predation includes both specialist egg predators such as some colubrid snakes and generalists such as foxes and badgers that opportunistically take eggs when they find them.

Some plants, like the pitcher plant, the Venus fly trap and the sundew, are carnivorous and consume insects. Methods of predation by plants varies greatly but often involves a food trap, mechanical stimulation, and electrical impulses to eventually catch and consume its prey. Some carnivorous fungi catch nematodes using either active traps in the form of constricting rings, or passive traps with adhesive structures.

Many species of protozoa (eukaryotes) and bacteria (prokaryotes) prey on other microorganisms; the feeding mode is evidently ancient, and evolved many times in both groups. Among freshwater and marine zooplankton, whether single-celled or multi-cellular, predatory grazing on phytoplankton and smaller zooplankton is common, and found in many species of nanoflagellates, dinoflagellates, ciliates, rotifers, a diverse range of meroplankton animal larvae, and two groups of crustaceans, namely copepods and cladocerans.

==Foraging==


To feed, a predator must search for, pursue and kill its prey. These actions form a foraging cycle. The predator must decide where to look for prey based on its geographical distribution; and once it has located prey, it must assess whether to pursue it or to wait for a better choice. If it chooses pursuit, its physical capabilities determine the mode of pursuit (e.g., ambush or chase). Having captured the prey, it may also need to expend energy &quot;handling&quot; it (e.g., killing it, removing any shell or spines, and ingesting it).

===Search===

Predators have a choice of search modes ranging from &quot;sit-and-wait&quot; to &quot;active&quot; or &quot;widely foraging&quot;. The sit-and-wait method is most suitable if the prey are dense and mobile, and the predator has low energy requirements. Wide foraging expends more energy, and is used when prey is sedentary or sparsely distributed. There is a continuum of search modes with intervals between periods of movement ranging from seconds to months. Sharks, sunfish, Insectivorous birds and shrews are almost always moving while web-building spiders, aquatic invertebrates, praying mantises and kestrels rarely move. In between, plovers and other shorebirds, freshwater fish including crappies, and the larvae of coccinellid beetles (ladybirds), alternate between actively searching and scanning the environment.

Prey distributions are often clumped, and predators respond by looking for &quot;patches&quot; where prey is dense and then searching within patches. Where food is found in patches, such as rare shoals of fish in a nearly empty ocean, the search stage requires the predator to travel for a substantial time, and to expend a significant amount of energy, to locate each food patch. For example, the black-browed albatross regularly makes foraging flights to a range of around , up to a maximum foraging range of for breeding birds gathering food for their young. With static prey, some predators can learn suitable patch locations and return to them at intervals to feed. The optimal foraging strategy for search has been modelled using the marginal value theorem.

Search patterns often appear random. One such is the Lévy walk, that tends to involve clusters of short steps with occasional long steps. It is a good fit to the behaviour of a wide variety of organisms including bacteria, honeybees, sharks and human hunter-gatherers.

===Assessment===

Having found prey, a predator must decide whether to pursue it or keep searching. The decision depends on the costs and benefits involved. A bird foraging for insects spends a lot of time searching but capturing and eating them is quick and easy, so the efficient strategy for the bird is to eat every palatable insect it finds. By contrast, a predator such as a lion or falcon finds its prey easily but capturing it requires a lot of effort. In that case, the predator is more selective.

One of the factors to consider is size. Prey that is too small may not be worth the trouble for the amount of energy it provides. Too large, and it may be too difficult to capture. For example, a mantid captures prey with its forelegs and they are optimized for grabbing prey of a certain size. Mantids are reluctant to attack prey that is far from that size. There is a positive correlation between the size of a predator and its prey.

A predator may assess a patch and decide whether to spend time searching for prey in it. This may involve some knowledge of the preferences of the prey; for example, ladybirds can choose a patch of vegetation suitable for their aphid prey.

===Capture===

To capture prey, predators have a spectrum of pursuit modes that range from overt chase (&quot;pursuit predation&quot;) to a sudden strike on nearby prey (&quot;ambush predation&quot;). Another strategy in between ambush and pursuit is &quot;ballistic interception&quot;, where a predator observes and predicts a prey&#x27;s motion and then launches its attack accordingly.

====Ambush====


Ambush or sit-and-wait predators are carnivorous animals that capture prey by stealth or surprise. In animals, ambush predation is characterized by the predator&#x27;s scanning the environment from a concealed position until a prey is spotted, and then rapidly executing a fixed surprise attack. Vertebrate ambush predators include frogs, fish such as the angel shark, the northern pike and the eastern frogfish. Among the many invertebrate ambush predators are trapdoor spiders and Australian Crab spiders on land and mantis shrimps in the sea. Ambush predators often construct a burrow in which to hide, improving concealment at the cost of reducing their field of vision. Some ambush predators also use lures to attract prey within striking range. The capturing movement has to be rapid to trap the prey, given that the attack is not modifiable once launched.

====Ballistic interception====

Ballistic interception is the strategy where a predator observes the movement of a prey, predicts its motion, works out an interception path, and then attacks the prey on that path. This differs from ambush predation in that the predator adjusts its attack according to how the prey is moving. Ballistic interception involves a brief period for planning, giving the prey an opportunity to escape. Some frogs wait until snakes have begun their strike before jumping, reducing the time available to the snake to recalibrate its attack, and maximising the angular adjustment that the snake would need to make to intercept the frog in real time. Ballistic predators include insects such as dragonflies, and vertebrates such as archerfish (attacking with a jet of water), chameleons (attacking with their tongues), and some colubrid snakes.

====Pursuit====


In pursuit predation, predators chase fleeing prey. If the prey flees in a straight line, capture depends only on the predator&#x27;s being faster than the prey. If the prey manoeuvres by turning as it flees, the predator must react in real time to calculate and follow a new intercept path, such as by parallel navigation, as it closes on the prey. Many pursuit predators use camouflage to approach the prey as close as possible unobserved (&quot;stalking&quot;) before starting the pursuit. Pursuit predators include terrestrial mammals such as humans, African wild dogs, spotted hyenas and wolves; marine predators such as dolphins, orcas and many predatory fishes, such as tuna; predatory birds (raptors) such as falcons; and insects such as dragonflies.

An extreme form of pursuit is endurance or persistence hunting, in which the predator tires out the prey by following it over a long distance, sometimes for hours at a time. The method is used by human hunter-gatherers and by canids such as African wild dogs and domestic hounds. The African wild dog is an extreme persistence predator, tiring out individual prey by following them for many miles at relatively low speed.

A specialised form of pursuit predation is the lunge feeding of baleen whales. These very large marine predators feed on plankton, especially krill, diving and actively swimming into concentrations of plankton, and then taking a huge gulp of water and filtering it through their feathery baleen plates.

Pursuit predators may be social, like the lion and wolf that hunt in groups, or solitary.

===Handling===

Once the predator has captured the prey, it has to handle it: very carefully if the prey is dangerous to eat, such as if it possesses sharp or poisonous spines, as in many prey fish. Some catfish such as the Ictaluridae have spines on the back (dorsal) and belly (pectoral) which lock in the erect position; as the catfish thrashes about when captured, these could pierce the predator&#x27;s mouth, possibly fatally. Some fish-eating birds like the osprey avoid the danger of spines by tearing up their prey before eating it.

===Solitary versus social predation===
In social predation, a group of predators cooperates to kill prey. This makes it possible to kill creatures larger than those they could overpower singly; for example, hyenas, and wolves collaborate to catch and kill herbivores as large as buffalo, and lions even hunt elephants. It can also make prey more readily available through strategies like flushing of prey and herding it into a smaller area. For example, when mixed flocks of birds forage, the birds in front flush out insects that are caught by the birds behind. Spinner dolphins form a circle around a school of fish and move inwards, concentrating the fish by a factor of 200. By hunting socially chimpanzees can catch colobus monkeys that would readily escape an individual hunter, while cooperating Harris hawks can trap rabbits.

Predators of different species sometimes cooperate to catch prey. In coral reefs, when fish such as the grouper and coral trout spot prey that is inaccessible to them, they signal to giant moray eels, Napoleon wrasses or octopuses. These predators are able to access small crevices and flush out the prey. Killer whales have been known to help whalers hunt baleen whales.

Social hunting allows predators to tackle a wider range of prey, but at the risk of competition for the captured food. Solitary predators have more chance of eating what they catch, at the price of increased expenditure of energy to catch it, and increased risk that the prey will escape. Ambush predators are often solitary to reduce the risk of becoming prey themselves. Of 245 terrestrial members of the Carnivora (the group that includes the cats, dogs, and bears), 177 are solitary; and 35 of the 37 wild cats are solitary, including the cougar and cheetah. However, the solitary cougar does allow other cougars to share in a kill, and the coyote can be either solitary or social. Other solitary predators include the northern pike, wolf spiders and all the thousands of species of solitary wasps among arthropods, and many microorganisms and zooplankton.

==Specialization==

===Physical adaptations===

Under the pressure of natural selection, predators have evolved a variety of physical adaptations for detecting, catching, killing, and digesting prey. These include speed, agility, stealth, sharp senses, claws, teeth, filters, and suitable digestive systems.

For detecting prey, predators have well-developed vision, smell, or hearing. Predators as diverse as owls and jumping spiders have forward-facing eyes, providing accurate binocular vision over a relatively narrow field of view, whereas prey animals often have less acute all-round vision. Animals such as foxes can smell their prey even when it is concealed under of snow or earth. Many predators have acute hearing, and some such as echolocating bats hunt exclusively by active or passive use of sound.

Predators including big cats, birds of prey, and ants share powerful jaws, sharp teeth, or claws which they use to seize and kill their prey. Some predators such as snakes and fish-eating birds like herons and cormorants swallow their prey whole; some snakes can unhinge their jaws to allow them to swallow large prey, while fish-eating birds have long spear-like beaks that they use to stab and grip fast-moving and slippery prey. Fish and other predators have developed the ability to crush or open the armoured shells of molluscs.

Many predators are powerfully built and can catch and kill animals larger than themselves; this applies as much to small predators such as ants and shrews as to big and visibly muscular carnivores like the cougar and lion.

===Diet and behaviour===


Predators are often highly specialized in their diet and hunting behaviour; for example, the Eurasian lynx only hunts small ungulates. Others such as leopards are more opportunistic generalists, preying on at least 100 species. The specialists may be highly adapted to capturing their preferred prey, whereas generalists may be better able to switch to other prey when a preferred target is scarce. When prey have a clumped (uneven) distribution, the optimal strategy for the predator is predicted to be more specialized as the prey are more conspicuous and can be found more quickly; this appears to be correct for predators of immobile prey, but is doubtful with mobile prey.
In size-selective predation, predators select prey of a certain size. Large prey may prove troublesome for a predator, while small prey might prove hard to find and in any case provide less of a reward. This has led to a correlation between the size of predators and their prey. Size may also act as a refuge for large prey. For example, adult elephants are relatively safe from predation by lions, but juveniles are vulnerable.

=== Camouflage and mimicry ===


Members of the cat family such as the snow leopard (treeless highlands), tiger (grassy plains, reed swamps), ocelot (forest), fishing cat (waterside thickets), and lion (open plains) are camouflaged with coloration and disruptive patterns suiting their habitats.

In aggressive mimicry, certain predators, including insects and fishes, make use of coloration and behaviour to attract prey. Female &quot;Photuris&quot; fireflies, for example, copy the light signals of other species, thereby attracting male fireflies, which they capture and eat. Flower mantises are ambush predators; camouflaged as flowers, such as orchids, they attract prey and seize it when it is close enough. Frogfishes are extremely well camouflaged, and actively lure their prey to approach using an esca, a bait on the end of a rod-like appendage on the head, which they wave gently to mimic a small animal, gulping the prey in an extremely rapid movement when it is within range.

===Venom===
Many smaller predators such as the box jellyfish use venom to subdue their prey, and venom can also aid in digestion (as is the case for rattlesnakes and some spiders). The marbled sea snake that has adapted to egg predation has atrophied venom glands, and the gene for its three finger toxin contains a mutation (the deletion of two nucleotides) that inactives it. These changes are explained by the fact that its prey does not need to be subdued.

===Electric fields===

Several groups of predatory fish have the ability to detect, track, and sometimes, as in the electric ray, to incapacitate their prey by sensing and generating electric fields. The electric organ is derived from modified nerve or muscle tissue.

===Physiology===

Physiological adaptations to predation include the ability of predatory bacteria to digest the complex peptidoglycan polymer from the cell walls of the bacteria that they prey upon. Carnivorous vertebrates of all five major classes (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) have lower relative rates of sugar to amino acid transport than either herbivores or omnivores, presumably because they acquire plenty of amino acids from the animal proteins in their diet.

== Antipredator adaptations ==


To counter predation, prey have evolved defences for use at each stage of an attack. They can try to avoid detection, such as by using camouflage and mimicry. They can detect predators and warn others of their presence.
If detected, they can try to avoid being the target of an attack, for example, by signalling that they are toxic or unpalatable, by signalling that a chase would be unprofitable, or by forming groups. If they become a target, they can try to fend off the attack with defences such as armour, quills, unpalatability, or mobbing; and they can often escape an attack in progress by startling the predator, playing dead, shedding body parts such as tails, or simply fleeing.

== Coevolution ==

Predators and prey are natural enemies, and many of their adaptations seem designed to counter each other. For example, bats have sophisticated echolocation systems to detect insects and other prey, and insects have developed a variety of defences including the ability to hear the echolocation calls. Many pursuit predators that run on land, such as wolves, have evolved long limbs in response to the increased speed of their prey. Their adaptations have been characterized as an evolutionary arms race, an example of the coevolution of two species. In a gene centered view of evolution, the genes of predator and prey can be thought of as competing for the prey&#x27;s body. However, the &quot;life-dinner&quot; principle of Dawkins and Krebs predicts that this arms race is asymmetric: if a predator fails to catch its prey, it loses its dinner, while if it succeeds, the prey loses its life.

The metaphor of an arms race implies ever-escalating advances in attack and defence. However, these adaptations come with a cost; for instance, longer legs have an increased risk of breaking, while the specialized tongue of the chameleon, with its ability to act like a projectile, is useless for lapping water, so the chameleon must drink dew off vegetation.

The &quot;life-dinner&quot; principle has been criticized on multiple grounds. The extent of the asymmetry in natural selection depends in part on the heritability of the adaptive traits. Also, if a predator loses enough dinners, it too will lose its life. On the other hand, the fitness cost of a given lost dinner is unpredictable, as the predator may quickly find better prey. In addition, most predators are generalists, which reduces the impact of a given prey adaption on a predator. Since specialization is caused by predator-prey coevolution, the rarity of specialists may imply that predator-prey arms races are rare.

It is difficult to determine whether given adaptations are truly the result of coevolution, where a prey adaptation gives rise to a predator adaptation that is countered by further adaptation in the prey. An alternative explanation is &quot;escalation&quot;, where predators are adapting to competitors, their own predators or dangerous prey. Apparent adaptations to predation may also have arisen for other reasons and then been co-opted for attack or defence. In some of the insects preyed on by bats, hearing evolved before bats appeared and was used to hear signals used for territorial defence and mating. Their hearing evolved in response to bat predation, but the only clear example of reciprocal adaptation in bats is stealth echolocation.

A more symmetric arms race may occur when the prey are dangerous, having spines, quills, toxins or venom that can harm the predator. The predator can respond with avoidance, which in turn drives the evolution of mimicry. Avoidance is not necessarily an evolutionary response as it is generally learned from bad experiences with prey. However, when the prey is capable of killing the predator (as can a coral snake with its venom), there is no opportunity for learning and avoidance must be inherited. Predators can also respond to dangerous prey with counter-adaptations. In western North America, the common garter snake has developed a resistance to the toxin in the skin of the rough-skinned newt.

==Role in ecosystems==

Predators affect their ecosystems not only directly by eating their own prey, but by indirect means such as reducing predation by other species, or altering the foraging behaviour of a herbivore, as with the biodiversity effect of wolves on riverside vegetation or sea otters on kelp forests. This may explain population dynamics effects such as the cycles observed in lynx and snowshoe hares.

=== Trophic level ===
One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Carnivores that feed on herbivores are secondary consumers; their predators are tertiary consumers, and so forth. At the top of this food chain are apex predators such as lions. Many predators however eat from multiple levels of the food chain; a carnivore may eat both secondary and tertiary consumers. This means that many predators must contend with intraguild predation, where other predators kill and eat them. For example, coyotes compete with and sometimes kill gray foxes and bobcats.

=== Trophic transfer ===
Trophic transfer within an ecosystem refers to the transport of energy and nutrients as a result of predation. Energy passes from one trophic level to the next as predators consume organic matter from another organism&#x27;s body. Within each transfer, while there are uses of energy, there are also losses of energy.

Marine trophic levels vary depending on locality and the size of the primary producers. There are generally up to six trophic levels in the open ocean, four over continental shelves, and around  three in upwelling zones. For example, a marine habitat with five trophic levels could be represented as follows: Herbivores (feed primarily on phytoplankton); Carnivores (feed primarily on other zooplankton/animals); Detritivores (feed primarily on dead organic matter/detritus; Omnivores (feed on a mixed diet of phyto- and zooplankton and detritus); and Mixotrophs which combine autotrophy (using light energy to grow without intake of any additional organic compounds or nutrients) with heterotrophy (feeding on other plants and animals for energy and nutrients—herbivores, omnivores and carnivores, and detritivores).

Trophic transfer efficiency measures how effectively energy is transferred or passed up through higher trophic levels of the marine food web. As energy moves up the trophic levels, it decreases due to heat, waste, and the natural metabolic processes that occur as predators consume their prey. The result is that only about 10% of the energy at any trophic level is transferred to the next level. This is often referred to as &quot;the 10% rule&quot; which limits the number of trophic levels that an individual ecosystem is capable of supporting.

=== Biodiversity maintained by apex predation ===
Predators may increase the biodiversity of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant. Such predators are known as keystone species and may have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular ecosystem. Introduction or removal of this predator, or changes in its population density, can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem. For example, grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over.

The elimination of wolves from Yellowstone National Park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid. In that area, wolves are both keystone species and apex predators. Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area&#x27;s plant populations. In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing near streams, protecting the beavers&#x27; food sources. The removal of wolves had a direct effect on the beaver population, as their habitat became territory for grazing. Increased browsing on willows and conifers along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because the reduced beaver population was no longer able to slow the water down and keep the soil in place. The predators were thus demonstrated to be of vital importance in the ecosystem.

=== Population dynamics ===


In the absence of predators, the population of a species can grow exponentially until it approaches the carrying capacity of the environment. Predators limit the growth of prey both by consuming them and by changing their behavior. Increases or decreases in the prey population can also lead to increases or decreases in the number of predators, for example, through an increase in the number of young they bear.

Cyclical fluctuations have been seen in populations of predator and prey, often with offsets between the predator and prey cycles. A well-known example is that of the snowshoe hare and lynx. Over a broad span of boreal forests in Alaska and Canada, the hare populations fluctuate in near synchrony with a 10-year period, and the lynx populations fluctuate in response. This was first seen in historical records of animals caught by fur hunters for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company over more than a century.

A simple model of a system with one species each of predator and prey, the Lotka–Volterra equations, predicts population cycles. However, attempts to reproduce the predictions of this model in the laboratory have often failed; for example, when the protozoan &quot;Didinium nasutum&quot; is added to a culture containing its prey, &quot;Paramecium caudatum&quot;, the latter is often driven to extinction.

The Lotka–Volterra equations rely on several simplifying assumptions, and they are structurally unstable, meaning that any change in the equations can stabilize or destabilize the dynamics. For example, one assumption is that predators have a linear functional response to prey: the rate of kills increases in proportion to the rate of encounters. If this rate is limited by time spent handling each catch, then prey populations can reach densities above which predators cannot control them. Another assumption is that all prey individuals are identical. In reality, predators tend to select young, weak, and ill individuals, leaving prey populations able to regrow.

Many factors can stabilize predator and prey populations. One example is the presence of multiple predators, particularly generalists that are attracted to a given prey species if it is abundant and look elsewhere if it is not. As a result, population cycles tend to be found in northern temperate and subarctic ecosystems because the food webs are simpler. The snowshoe hare-lynx system is subarctic, but even this involves other predators, including coyotes, goshawks and great horned owls, and the cycle is reinforced by variations in the food available to the hares.

A range of mathematical models have been developed by relaxing the assumptions made in the Lotka–Volterra model; these variously allow animals to have geographic distributions, or to migrate; to have differences between individuals, such as sexes and an age structure, so that only some individuals reproduce; to live in a varying environment, such as with changing seasons; and analysing the interactions of more than just two species at once. Such models predict widely differing and often chaotic predator-prey population dynamics. The presence of refuge areas, where prey are safe from predators, may enable prey to maintain larger populations but may also destabilize the dynamics.

== Evolutionary history ==

Predation dates from before the rise of commonly recognized carnivores by hundreds of millions (perhaps billions) of years. Predation has evolved repeatedly in different groups of organisms. The rise of eukaryotic cells at around 2.7 Gya, the rise of multicellular organisms at about 2 Gya, and the rise of mobile predators (around 600 Mya - 2 Gya, probably around 1 Gya) have all been attributed to early predatory behavior, and many very early remains show evidence of boreholes or other markings attributed to small predator species. It likely triggered major evolutionary transitions including the arrival of cells, eukaryotes, sexual reproduction, multicellularity, increased size, mobility (including insect flight) and armoured shells and exoskeletons.

The earliest predators were microbial organisms, which engulfed or grazed on others. Because the fossil record is poor, these first predators could date back anywhere between 1 and over 2.7 Gya (billion years ago). Predation visibly became important shortly before the Cambrian period—around —as evidenced by the almost simultaneous development of calcification in animals and algae, and predation-avoiding burrowing. However, predators had been grazing on micro-organisms since at least , with evidence of selective (rather than random) predation from a similar time.

&quot;Auroralumina attenboroughii&quot; is an Ediacaran crown-group cnidarian (557–562 mya, some 20 million years before the Cambrian explosion) from Charnwood Forest, England. It is thought to be one of the earliest predatory animals, catching small prey with its nematocysts as modern cnidarians do.

The fossil record demonstrates a long history of interactions between predators and their prey from the Cambrian period onwards, showing for example that some predators drilled through the shells of bivalve and gastropod molluscs, while others ate these organisms by breaking their shells.
Among the Cambrian predators were invertebrates like the anomalocaridids with appendages suitable for grabbing prey, large compound eyes and jaws made of a hard material like that in the exoskeleton of an insect.
Some of the first fish to have jaws were the armoured and mainly predatory placoderms of the Silurian to Devonian periods, one of which, the &quot;Dunkleosteus&quot;, is considered the world&#x27;s first vertebrate &quot;superpredator&quot;, preying upon other predators.
Insects developed the ability to fly in the Early Carboniferous or Late Devonian, enabling them among other things to escape from predators.
Among the largest predators that have ever lived were the theropod dinosaurs such as &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; from the Cretaceous period. They preyed upon herbivorous dinosaurs such as hadrosaurs, ceratopsians and ankylosaurs.

==In human society==

===Practical uses===

Humans, as omnivores, are to some extent predatory, using weapons and tools to fish, hunt and trap animals. They also use other predatory species such as dogs, cormorants, and falcons to catch prey for food or for sport. 
Two mid-sized predators, dogs and cats, are the animals most often kept as pets in western societies.
Human hunters, including the San of southern Africa, use persistence hunting, a form of pursuit predation where the pursuer may be slower than prey such as a kudu antelope over short distances, but follows it in the midday heat until it is exhausted, a pursuit that can take up to five hours. 
In biological pest control, predators (and parasitoids) from a pest&#x27;s natural range are introduced to control populations, at the risk of causing unforeseen problems. Natural predators, provided they do no harm to non-pest species, are an environmentally friendly and sustainable way of reducing damage to crops and an alternative to the use of chemical agents such as pesticides.

===Symbolic uses===

In film, the idea of the predator as a dangerous if humanoid enemy is used in the 1987 science fiction horror action film &quot;Predator&quot; and its three sequels. A terrifying predator, a gigantic man-eating great white shark, is central, too, to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1974 thriller &quot;Jaws&quot;.

Among poetry on the theme of predation, a predator&#x27;s consciousness might be explored, such as in Ted Hughes&#x27;s &quot;Pike&quot;. The phrase &quot;Nature, red in tooth and claw&quot; from Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s 1849 poem &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot; has been interpreted as referring to the struggle between predators and prey.

In mythology and folk fable, predators such as the fox and wolf have mixed reputations. The fox was a symbol of fertility in ancient Greece, but a weather demon in northern Europe, and a creature of the devil in early Christianity; the fox is presented as sly, greedy, and cunning in fables from Aesop onwards. The big bad wolf is known to children in tales such as &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, but is a demonic figure in the Icelandic Edda sagas, where the wolf Fenrir appears in the apocalyptic ending of the world. In the Middle Ages, belief spread in werewolves, men transformed into wolves. In ancient Rome, and in ancient Egypt, the wolf was worshipped, the she-wolf appearing in the founding myth of Rome, suckling Romulus and Remus. More recently, in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1894 &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Mowgli is raised by the wolf pack. Attitudes to large predators in North America, such as wolf, grizzly bear and cougar, have shifted from hostility or ambivalence, accompanied by active persecution, towards positive and protective in the second half of the 20th century.

<text>A diastase (; from Greek διάστασις, &quot;separation&quot;) is any one of a group of enzymes that catalyses the breakdown of starch into maltose. For example, the diastase α-amylase degrades starch to a mixture of the disaccharide maltose; the trisaccharide maltotriose, which contains three α (1-4)-linked glucose residues; and oligosaccharides, known as dextrins, that contain the α (1-6)-linked glucose branches.

Diastase was the first enzyme discovered. It was extracted from malt solution in 1833 by Anselme Payen and Jean-François Persoz, chemists at a French sugar factory. The 
name &quot;diastase&quot; comes from the Greek word διάστασις (&quot;diastasis&quot;) (a parting, a separation), because when beer mash is heated, the enzyme causes the starch in the barley seed to transform quickly into soluble sugars and hence the husk to separate from the rest of the seed. Today, &quot;diastase&quot; refers to any α-, β-, or γ-amylase (all of which are hydrolases) that can break down carbohydrates.

The commonly used -ase suffix for naming enzymes was derived from the name diastase.

When used as a pharmaceutical drug, diastase has the ATC code .

Amylases can also be extracted from other sources including plants, saliva and milk.

==Clinical significance==
Urine diastase is useful in diagnosing uncertain abdominal cases (especially when pancreatitis is suspected), stones in the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis), jaundice and in ruling out post-operative injury to the pancreas; provided that the diastase level is correlated with clinical features of the patient.

Diastase is also used in conjunction with periodic acid–Schiff stain in histology. For example, glycogen is darkly stained by PAS but can be dissolved by diastase. Fungi, on the other hand, stain darkly with PAS even after treatment by diastase.

<doc id="57561" wikidata="Q231458" url="?curid=57561" title="Palm oil">
<text>Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp (reddish pulp) of the fruit of oil palms. The oil is used in food manufacturing, in beauty products, and as biofuel. Palm oil accounted for about 36% of global oils produced from oil crops in 2014. Palm oils are easier to stabilize and maintain quality of flavor and consistency in ultra-processed foods, so they are frequently favored by food manufacturers. Globally, humans consumed an average of of palm oil per person in 2015. Demand has also increased for other uses, such as cosmetics and biofuels, encouraging the growth of palm oil plantations in tropical countries.

The use of palm oil has attracted the concern of environmental and human rights groups. The palm oil industry is a significant contributor to deforestation in the tropics where palms are grown and has been cited as a factor in social problems due to allegations of human rights violations among growers. 

In 2018, a report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature acknowledged that palm oil is much more efficient than other oils in terms of land and water usage; however, deforestation causes more biodiversity loss than switching to other oils. The biggest global producers of palm oil are Indonesia, who produced 60% of it in 2022, followed by Malaysia, Thailand, and Nigeria. Indonesia produces biodiesel primarily from palm oil.

==History==

Humans used oil palms as far back as 5,000 years. In the late 1800s, archaeologists discovered a substance that they concluded was originally palm oil in a tomb at Abydos dating back to 3,000 BCE.

Palm oil from &quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot; has long been recognized in West and Central African countries used widely as a cooking oil. European merchants trading with West Africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use as a cooking oil in Europe.

Palm oil became a highly sought-after commodity by British traders for use as an industrial lubricant for machinery during Britain&#x27;s Industrial Revolution. Palm oil formed the basis of soap products, such as Lever Brothers&#x27; (now Unilever) &quot;Sunlight&quot; soap, and the American Palmolive brand.

By around 1870, palm oil constituted the primary export of some West African countries, which often led to oppressive labor practices, as highlighted in the account of Abina Mansah&#x27;s life. However, this was overtaken by cocoa in the 1880s with the introduction of colonial European cocoa plantations.

==Processing==
Palm oil is naturally reddish in color because of a high beta-carotene content. It is not to be confused with palm kernel oil derived from the kernel of the same fruit or coconut oil derived from the kernel of the coconut palm (&quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;). The differences are in color (raw palm kernel oil lacks carotenoids and is not red), and in saturated fat content: palm mesocarp oil is 49% saturated, while palm kernel oil and coconut oil are 81% and 86% saturated fats, respectively. However, crude red palm oil that has been refined, neutralized, bleached and deodorized, a common commodity called RBD (refined, bleached, and deodorized) palm oil, does not contain carotenoids. Many industrial food applications of palm oil use fractionated components of palm oil (often listed as &quot;modified palm oil&quot;) whose saturation levels can reach 90%; these &quot;modified&quot; palm oils can become highly saturated, but are not necessarily hydrogenated.

The oil palm produces bunches containing many fruits with the fleshy mesocarp enclosing a kernel that is covered by a very hard shell. The FAO considers palm oil (coming from the pulp) and palm kernels to be primary products. The oil extraction rate from a bunch varies from 17 to 27% for palm oil, and from 4 to 10% for palm kernels.

Along with coconut oil, palm oil is one of the few highly saturated vegetable fats and is semisolid at room temperature. Palm oil is a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt of Africa, Southeast Asia and parts of Brazil. Its use in the commercial food industry in other parts of the world is widespread because of its lower cost and the high oxidative stability (saturation) of the refined product when used for frying. One source reported that humans consumed an average of palm oil per person in 2015.

=== Extraction ===

Palm oil is traditionally, and still industrially, produced by milling the fruits of oil palm.

Besides milling, palm oil is produced by cold-pressing the fruit of the oil palm since the 1990s. This type of artisanal palm oil is usually not further refined, so it keeps the natural red color. It is bottled for use as a cooking oil, in addition to other uses such as being blended into mayonnaise and vegetable oil.

The result of milling or cold-pressing is a mixture of water, crude palm oil, and fibers from the palm fruit. A minimum degree of processing is required to obtain the oil. The mixture is first passed through a filter to remove the solids, then separated by density to remove the water. Density treatment can also act as a basic form of degumming, provided that the fruit is steamed before milling to hydrolyze the gum, at a cost of also losing some triglycerides to hydrolysis.

The result of basic processing is called a &quot;crude palm oil&quot; or a &quot;&quot;, referring to its intense color due to the high carotenoid content. Red palm oil is a traditional cooking oil in West Africa. The free fatty acids within provide a &quot;bite&quot; to the flavor. The triglyceride part is around 50% saturated fat—considerably less than palm kernel oil—and 40% monounsaturated fat and 10% polyunsaturated fat. It is a source of Vitamin A and Vitamin E.

===Refining===

Crude PO can be refined to remove its non-triglyceride components.

# Bleaching removes color from the oil. This is achieved by adding a clay absorbent called bleaching earth in a vacuum mixer.
# Filters remove the clay from the oil.
# The oil enters the deodorizer, which is responsible for removing free fatty acids (FFA) generated by hydrolysis. One type of deodorizer works by distillating out the FFAs using a set of different temperatures. The FFA is collected as &quot;palm fatty acid distillate&quot; (PFAD). PFAD is itself a valuable product used in the manufacture of soaps, washing powder and other products.
# The final, refined oil is called &quot;refined, bleached and deodorized palm oil&quot; (RBD PO). RBD PO is the basic palm oil sold on the world&#x27;s commodity markets.

RBD PO is also known as . It can be further fractionated using the different melting points of its components. The part with a higher melting point, which crystalizes out as a solid earlier, is called palm stearin. It consists of mostly saturated fats. The remaining liquid part is called palm olein. It is also possible to fractionate at a different point of processing, even with crude palm oil.

RBD PO, or &quot;palm shortening&quot;, is extensively used in food manufacture. It is valued for its low polyunsaturated fat content, which offers high stability against rancidity and allows it to replace hydrogenated fats in a variety of baked and fried products.

== Uses ==
===In food===
The highly saturated nature of palm oil renders it solid at room temperature in temperate regions, making it a cheap substitute for butter or hydrogenated vegetable oils in uses where solid fat is desirable, such as the making of pastry dough and baked goods. Palm oil is used in West African cuisine such as egusi soup and okra soup. Palm oil is sometimes used as a minor ingredient in calf milk replacer.

=== Non-food consumer products ===
Palm oil is pervasively used in personal care and cleaning products, and it provides the foaming agent in nearly every soap, shampoo, or detergent. Around 70% of personal care products including soap, shampoo, makeup, and lotion, contain ingredients derived from palm oil. However, there are more than 200 different names for these palm oil ingredients and only 10% of them include the word &quot;palm&quot;.

===Biomass and biofuels===
Palm oil is used to produce both methyl ester and hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel. Palm oil methyl ester is created through a process called transesterification. Palm oil biodiesel is often blended with other fuels to create palm oil biodiesel blends. Palm oil biodiesel meets the European EN 14214 standard for biodiesels. Hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel is produced by direct hydrogenolysis of the fat into alkanes and propane. The world&#x27;s largest palm oil biodiesel plant is the €550 million Finnish-operated Neste Oil biodiesel plant in Singapore, which opened in 2011 with a capacity of 800,000 tons per year and produces hydrodeoxygenated NEXBTL biodiesel from palm oil imported from Malaysia and Indonesia.

Significant amounts of palm oil exports to Europe are converted to biodiesel (as of early 2018: Indonesia: 40%, Malaysia 30%). In 2014, almost half of all the palm oil in Europe was burned as car and truck fuel. As of 2018, one-half of Europe&#x27;s palm oil imports were used for biodiesel. Use of palm oil as biodiesel generates three times the carbon emissions as using fossil fuel, and, for example, &quot;biodiesel made from Indonesian palm oil makes the global carbon problem worse, not better.&quot;

There are pressures for increased oil palm production from Indonesian palm-based biodiesel programs. The biodiesel currently contains a 30:70 palm oil to conventional diesel ratio (known as B30) at the gas pumps. The Indonesian government is aiming to produce 100% palm oil biodiesel (or B100) to transition out of using conventional diesel. The Indonesian government has estimated it would need to establish approximately 15 million hectares of oil palm plantations to meet these future demands.

The organic waste matter that is produced when processing oil palm, including oil palm shells and oil palm fruit bunches, can also be used to produce energy. This waste material can be converted into pellets that can be used as a biofuel. Additionally, palm oil that has been used to fry foods can be converted into methyl esters for biodiesel. The used cooking oil is chemically treated to create a biodiesel similar to petroleum diesel.

===In wound care===
Although palm oil is applied to wounds for its supposed antimicrobial effects, research does not confirm its effectiveness.

==Production==

In 2023–2024, world production of palm oil was 77.3 million tonnes, led by Indonesia with 57% of the total. The annual production of palm oil is projected to reach 240 million tonnes by 2050. During the 2022 food crises instigated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and crop failures in other parts of the world due to extreme weather caused by climate change, the Indonesian government banned exports of palm oil. This combined with a reduced harvest in Malaysia greatly increased global prices, while reducing availability causing ripple effects in the global supply chain. On 23 May 2022, the Indonesian government reopened trading hoping to balance supplies.

===Indonesia===
Indonesia is the world&#x27;s largest producer of palm oil, producing 44 million tonnes in 2023-24.

===Malaysia===

Malaysia is the world&#x27;s second-largest producer of palm oil, producing 19.7 million tonnes in 2023-24. 

In 1992, in response to concerns about deforestation, the Government of Malaysia pledged to limit the expansion of palm oil plantations by retaining a minimum of half the nation&#x27;s land as forest cover.

===Nigeria===
As of 2023-24, Nigeria was the fifth-largest producer, with 1.5 million tonnes. Both small- and large-scale producers participate in the industry. In much of the Niger Delta, palm oil is commonoly referred to as &quot;red oil&quot; (or red gold) to distinguish it from the &quot;black oil&quot; (crude oil) which dominates production.

===Thailand===
Thailand is the world&#x27;s third-largest producer of crude palm oil, producing 3.6 million tonnes in 2023-24. Nearly all of Thai production is consumed locally. Almost 85% of palm plantations and extraction mills are in south Thailand. At year-end 2016, 4.7 to 5.8 million rai () were planted in oil palms, employing 300,000 farmers, mostly on small landholdings of 20 rai (). ASEAN as a region accounts for of palm oil production, about 85% of the world total and more than 90% of global exports. Indonesia accounts for 52% of world exports. Malaysian exports total 38%. The biggest consumers of palm oil are India, the European Union, and China, with the three consuming nearly 50% of world exports. Thailand&#x27;s Department of Internal Trade (DIT) usually sets the price of crude palm oil and refined palm oil Thai farmers have a relatively low yield compared to those in Malaysia and Indonesia. Thai palm oil crops yield 4–17% oil compared to around 20% in competing countries. In addition, Indonesian and Malaysian oil palm plantations are 10 times the size of Thai plantations.

===Benin===
Palm is native to the wetlands of western Africa, and south Benin already hosts many palm plantations. Its &#x27;Agricultural Revival Programme&#x27; has identified many thousands of hectares of land as suitable for new oil palm export plantations. In spite of the economic benefits, Non-governmental organisations (NGOs), such as Nature Tropicale, claim biofuels will compete with domestic food production in some existing prime agricultural sites. Other areas comprise peat land, whose drainage would have a deleterious environmental impact. They are also concerned genetically modified plants will be introduced into the region, jeopardizing the current premium paid for their non-GM crops.

According to recent article by National Geographic, most palm oil in Benin is still produced by women for domestic use. The FAO additionally states that peasants in Benin practice agroecology. They harvest palm fruit from small farms and the palm oil is mostly used for local consumption.

===Cameroon===
Cameroon had a production project underway initiated by Herakles Farms in the United States. However, the project was halted under the pressure of civil society organizations in Cameroon. Before the project was halted, Herakles left the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil early in negotiations. The project has been controversial due to opposition from villagers and the location of the project in a sensitive region for biodiversity.

===Colombia===
In 2018, total palm oil production in Colombia reached , representing some 8% of national agricultural GDP and benefiting mainly smallholders (65% of Colombia&#x27;s palm oil sector). According to a study from the Environmental, Science and Policy, Colombia has the potential to produce sustainable palm oil without causing deforestation. In addition, palm oil and other crops provide a productive alternative for illegal crops, like coca.

===Ecuador===

Ecuador aims to help palm oil producers switch to sustainable methods and achieve RSPO certification under initiatives to develop greener industries.

===Ghana===
Ghana has a lot of palm nut species, which may become an important contributor to the agriculture of the region. Although Ghana has multiple palm species, ranging from local palm nuts to other species locally called agric, it was only marketed locally and to neighboring countries. Production is now expanding as major investment funds are purchasing plantations because Ghana is considered a major growth area for palm oil.

===Kenya===
Kenya&#x27;s domestic production of edible oils covers about a third of its annual demand, estimated at . The rest is imported at a cost of around US$140 million a year, making edible oil the country&#x27;s second most important import after petroleum. Since 1993 a new hybrid variety of cold-tolerant, high-yielding oil palm has been promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in western Kenya. As well as alleviating the country&#x27;s deficit of edible oils while providing an important cash crop, it is claimed to have environmental benefits in the region, because it does not compete against food crops or native vegetation and it provides stabilisation for the soil.

=== Myanmar ===
Palm oil was introduced to British Burma (now Myanmar) in the 1920s. Beginning in the 1970s, smaller-scale palm oil plantations were developed in Tanintharyi Region, and Mon, Kayin, and Rakhine States. In 1999, the ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, initiated the large-scale development of such plantations, especially in Tanintharyi, the southernmost region of Myanmar. As of 2019, over 401,814 ha of palm oil concessions have been awarded to 44 companies. 60% of the awarded concessions consist of forests and native vegetation, and some concessions overlap with national parks, including Tanintharyi and Lenya National Parks, which have seen deforestation and threaten conservation efforts for endemic species like the Indochinese tiger.

==Social and environmental impact==

Forests have been cleared in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia to make space for oil-palm monoculture. This has significant impacts on the local ecosystems leading to deforestation and biodiversity loss. For example, these processes have resulted in significant acreage losses of the natural habitat of the three surviving species of orangutan. One species in particular, the Sumatran orangutan, has been listed as critically endangered because of habitat loss due to palm oil cultivation.

===Social===
In addition to environmental concerns, palm oil development in regions that produce it has also led to significant social conflict. Regions with fast growing palm oil production have experienced significant violations of Indigenous land rights, influxes of illegal immigrant labor and labor practices, and other alleged related human rights violations.

The palm oil industry has had both positive and negative impacts on workers, indigenous peoples, and residents of palm oil producing communities. Palm oil production provides employment opportunities, and has been shown to improve infrastructure, and social services and reduce poverty. However, in some cases, oil palm plantations have developed lands without consultation or compensation of the indigenous people inhabiting the land, resulting in social conflict. The use of illegal immigrants in Malaysia has also raised concerns about working conditions within the palm oil industry.
Some social initiatives use palm oil cultivation as part of poverty alleviation strategies. Examples include the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation&#x27;s hybrid oil palm project in Western Kenya, which improves incomes and diets of local populations, and Malaysia&#x27;s Federal Land Development Authority and Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority, which both support rural development.

====Food vs. fuel====

The use of palm oil in the production of biodiesel has led to concerns that the need for fuel is being placed ahead of the need for food, leading to malnutrition in developing nations. This is known as the food versus fuel debate. According to a 2008 report published in the &quot;Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews&quot;, palm oil was determined to be a sustainable source of both food and biofuel, and the production of palm oil biodiesel does not pose a threat to edible palm oil supplies. According to a 2009 study published in the &quot;Environmental Science and Policy&quot; journal, palm oil biodiesel might increase the demand for palm oil in the future, resulting in the expansion of palm oil production, and therefore an increased supply of food.

==== Human rights ====

One report indicated numerous allegations of human rights violations in the production of palm oil in Indonesia and Malaysia, including exposure to hazardous pesticides, child labor, rape and sexual abuse, and unsafe carrying loads. These incidents may receive no response by the company or police, or are left unreported because victims fear retaliation from their abuser. Pesticides used by palm oil plantations include paraquat, which has been banned in Europe over links to Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and glyphosate, which has been involved in a US class-action lawsuit regarding cancer (the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) classified glyphosate as causing serious eye damage but did not find evidence implicating it as a carcinogen).

Reports of indigenous peoples and communities in Indonesia, indicate losing farmland and traditionally significant land due to palm oil industry expansion. In 2017, there were over 650 different land disputes between palm oil plantations and indigenous landowners. Indigenous communities also expressed concern over the loss of natural resources, such as wild rubber, reed, and &quot;adat&quot; forests (communal forests). Indigenous communities have made some ground when it comes to land disputes, either through protest or legal means.

Other concerns when it comes to indigenous communities being impacted include lack of government oversight on palm oil plantations, political corruption, or the lack of enforcement of laws meant to protect indigenous lands. In countries such as Guatemala, palm oil plantations have significant leverage within the local justice system, leading local police to disregard land claims, going as far as using force to break up protests, and even murdering local leaders.

While only 5% of the world&#x27;s vegetable oil farmland is used for palm plantations, palm cultivation produces 38% of the world&#x27;s total vegetable oil supply. In terms of oil yield, a palm plantation is 10 times more productive than soybean, sunflower or rapeseed cultivation because the palm fruit and kernel both provide usable oil. Palm oil has garnered criticism from environmentalists due to the environmental importance of where it is grown. However, it is indisputably more efficient in comparison to other oil-producing plants. In 2016, it was found that palm oil farms produce around 4.17 metric tons of oil per hectare. By contrast other oils, such as sunflower, soybean, or peanut only produce 0.56, 0.39, and 0.16 metric tons respectively per hectare. Palm oil is the most sustainable vegetable oil in terms of yield, requiring one-ninth of land used by other vegetable oil crops. In the future, laboratory-grown microbes might achieve higher yields per unit of land at comparable prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.003&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, palm oil cultivation has been criticized for its impact on the natural environment, including deforestation, loss of natural habitats, and greenhouse gas emissions which have threatened critically endangered species, such as the orangutan and Sumatran tiger. Slash-and-burn techniques are still used to create new plantations across palm oil producing countries. From January to September 2019, 857,000 hectares of land was burned in Indonesia; peatlands accounted for more than a quarter of the burned area. The widespread deforestation and other environmental destruction in Indonesia, much of which is caused by palm oil production has often been described by academics as an ecocide.

Environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth oppose the use of palm oil biofuels, claiming that the deforestation caused by oil palm plantations is more damaging for the climate than the benefits gained by switching to biofuel and using the palms as carbon sinks.

A 2018 study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) concluded that palm oil is &quot;here to stay&quot; due to its higher productivity compared with many other vegetable oils. The IUCN maintains that replacing palm oil with other vegetable oils would necessitate greater amounts of agricultural land, negatively affecting biodiversity. The IUCN advocates better practices in the palm oil industry, including the prevention of plantations from expanding into forested regions and creating a demand for certified and sustainable palm oil products.

In 2019, the Rainforest Action Network surveyed eight global brands involved in palm oil extraction in the Leuser Ecosystem, and said that none was performing adequately in avoiding &quot;conflict palm oil&quot;. Many of the companies told The Guardian they were working to improve their performance. A WWF scorecard rated only 15 out of 173 companies as performing well.

In 2020 a study by Chain Reaction Research concluded that NDPE (No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation) policies cover 83% of palm oil refineries. NDPE policies are according to the Chain Reaction Research the most effective private mechanism to cut the direct link with deforestation, due to the economic leverage refineries have over palm oil growers.

Palm oil is one of seven commodities included in the 2023 EU Regulation on Deforestation-free products (EUDR), which aims to guarantee that the products European Union (EU) citizens consume do not contribute to deforestation or forest degradation worldwide.

==Markets==

According to the Hamburg-based &quot;Oil World&quot; trade journal, in 2008 global production of oils and fats stood at 160 million tonnes. Palm oil and palm kernel oil were jointly the largest contributor, accounting for 48 million tonnes, or 30% of the total output. Soybean oil came in second with 37 million tonnes (23%). About 38% of the oils and fats produced in the world were shipped across oceans. Of the 60 million tonnes of oils and fats exported around the world, palm oil and palm kernel oil made up close to 60%; Malaysia, with 45% of the market share, dominated the palm oil trade. Production of palm oil that complies with voluntary sustainability standards is growing at a faster rate than conventional production. Standard-compliant production increased by 110% from 2008 to 2016, while conventional production increased by 2%. The production of vegetable oils as a whole went up 125% between 2000 and 2020, driven by a sharp increase in palm oil.

===Food label regulations===
Previously, palm oil could be listed as &quot;vegetable fat&quot; or &quot;vegetable oil&quot; on food labels in the European Union (EU). From December 2014, food packaging in the EU is no longer allowed to use the generic terms &quot;vegetable fat&quot; or &quot;vegetable oil&quot; in the ingredients list. Food producers are required to list the specific type of vegetable fat used, including palm oil. Vegetable oils and fats can be grouped together in the ingredients list under the term &quot;vegetable oils&quot; or &quot;vegetable fats&quot; but this must be followed by the type of vegetable origin (e.g., palm, sunflower, or rapeseed) and the phrase &quot;in varying proportions&quot;.
In Malaysia, it is illegal to label products in ways that &quot;discriminate against&quot; palm oil. Offenders can be fined up to RM250,000 or imprisoned for up to five years. One convenience store was raided for selling &quot;no palm oil&quot; ice cream, with all products seized.

===Supply chain institutions===

==== Consumer Goods Forum ====
In 2010, the Consumer Goods Forum passed a resolution that its members would reduce deforestation to net zero by 2020. They planned to do this through sustainable production of several commodities, including palm oil. As of 2023 that goal has not been met.

==== Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) ====
==Nutrition, composition and health==
Palm oil is a food staple in many cuisines, contributing significant calories as well as fat. Globally, humans consumed an average of of palm oil per person in 2015. Although the relationship of palm oil consumption to disease risk has been previously assessed, the quality of the clinical research specifically assessing palm oil effects has been generally poor. Consequently, research has focused on the deleterious effects of palm oil and palmitic acid consumption as sources of saturated fat content in edible oils, leading to conclusions that palm oil and saturated fats should be replaced with polyunsaturated fats in the diet.

A 2015 meta-analysis and 2017 advisory from the American Heart Association indicated that palm oil is among foods supplying dietary saturated fat which increases blood levels of LDL cholesterol and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, leading to recommendations for reduced use or elimination of dietary palm oil in favor of consuming unhydrogenated vegetable oils. A 2019 meta-analysis found no association between total fat, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acid, and polyunsaturated fatty acid intake with risk of cardiovascular disease.

Glycidyl fatty acid esters (GE), 3-MCPD and 2-MCPD, are found especially in palm oils and palm fats because of their refining at high temperatures (approx. ). Since glycidol, the parent compound of GE, is considered genotoxic and carcinogenic, the EFSA did not set a safe level for GE. According to the chair of the CONTAM (EFSA&#x27;s expert Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain), &quot;The exposure to GE of babies consuming solely infant formula is a particular concern as this is up to ten times what would be considered of low concern for public health&quot;. The EFSA&#x27;s tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 3-MCPD and its fatty acid esters was set to 0.8 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day (μg/kg bw/day) in 2016 and increased to 2 μg/kg bw/day in 2017, based on evidence linking this substance to organ damage in animal tests and on possible adverse effects on the kidney and on male fertility. According to the EFSA, there is not enough data to set a safe level for 2-MCPD. As of December 2022, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board issued an amendment to its palm oil licensing conditions to include maximum limits of 1.25 ppm and 1 ppm, respectively, to the amount of 3-MCPDE and GE that can be found in processed palm oil.

=== Key components ===

==== Fatty acids ====

Palm oil, like all fats, is composed of fatty acids, esterified with glycerol. Palm oil has an especially high concentration of saturated fat, specifically the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid, to which it gives its name. Monounsaturated oleic acid is also a major constituent of palm oil. Unrefined palm oil is a significant source of tocotrienol, part of the vitamin E family.

The linoleic acid content of palm oil is about 6.4 - 15%.

The approximate concentration of esterified fatty acids in palm oil is:
==== Carotenes ====
Red palm oil is rich in carotenes, such as alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene, which give it a characteristic dark red color. However, palm oil that has been refined, bleached and deodorized from crude palm oil (called &quot;RBD palm oil&quot;) does not contain carotenes.

==== Palmitic acid ====
Excessive intake of palmitic acid, which makes up 44% of palm oil, increases blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol, and so increases risk of cardiovascular diseases. Other reviews, the World Health Organization, and the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute have encouraged consumers to limit the consumption of palm oil, palmitic acid and foods high in saturated fat.

<text>Go Fly (styled and trading as Go) was the name of a British low-cost airline, founded by British Airways in 1998. It operated flights between London Stansted Airport and destinations in Europe. The airline was purchased from BA in a management buyout backed by the private equity firm 3i in 2001. In 2002, it was bought by its rival EasyJet and was merged into that airline&#x27;s operations by 2003.

Its head office was in Enterprise House at London Stansted Airport in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex.

==History==

Bob Ayling, CEO of British Airways, approached EasyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou to ask whether they could meet, claiming that he was fascinated by how the Greek entrepreneur had made the budget airline formula work. Haji-Ioannou not only agreed, but allegedly showed Ayling his business plan.

In 1997, BA announced that, under the project name Operation Blue Sky, it would launch its own low-cost airline to meet the changing demand for air travel in Europe. According to Ayling, the new airline would &quot;quickly become a favourite with the budget traveller&quot; via its pricing scheme and available flights. Barbara Cassani, who had been British Airways&#x27; General Manager in New York and had been credited with turning around the airline&#x27;s flagging fortunes in the transatlantic market in the early 1990s, was chosen by Ayling to set up the new venture. The new airline would be run separately from British Airways as a wholly owned subsidiary, and would compete in the European low-cost carrier market, dominated by Ryanair and EasyJet. In 1998, the name of the new airline was announced as Go Fly Limited, following a lengthy debate over how to choose a name that would best suit the positioning of this new airline, which was already facing challenges from EasyJet, and Virgin Atlantic, among others.

The airline&#x27;s fleet consisted of Boeing 737s. The first two, 737-300s G-IGOC and G-IGOE, were acquired via lease from Philippine Airlines.

An additional plane, a 737-3Q8 G-IGOF, was leased in 1998. On Friday 22 May 1998, Go flew for the first time from its base at London Stansted Airport to Rome Ciampino. The following afternoon saw the airline&#x27;s inaugural flight to Milan Malpensa Airport. The Italian launch of Go&#x27;s operation was managed by former American Airlines executive Luca Berti.

As part of EasyJet&#x27;s campaign against Go, Haji-Ioannou and nine other EasyJet staff booked tickets for the flight, arriving in orange boiler suits. Other early routes were to Copenhagen, Bologna and Lisbon. In July flights to Glasgow were started, then to Munich in November and Venice in December 1998, followed by Málaga, Faro, Bilbao in April 1999 and Madrid.

After leasing three further planes, including a former Air Liberté plane and another ex-British Midland jet in 1998 and 1999, six additional planes were delivered direct from Boeing, leased from GE Commercial Aviation Services, bringing the total to 13. Although this was four more than originally envisaged, additional routes helped to spread the overheads.

To stem mounting losses, a significant change in strategy was announced in June 1999, cutting back on the existing schedules in favour of new routes tapping into the summer holiday market to Alicante, Ibiza and Palma de Mallorca. This was followed by winter schedules targeting skiers travelling to Lyon and Zürich, together with a new route to Prague.

In 2001, Go expanded its UK operations, opening a second base at Bristol Airport, bringing low-cost travel to South West England for the first time.

Go was very much the brainchild of Bob Ayling, and when he left British Airways, Go&#x27;s future was rendered shaky. In 2000, BA announced it planned to sell Go as part of efforts to improve profits, coupled with concerns that Go was attracting customers from BA&#x27;s own services.

Estimated gains from the sale fluctuated and in January 2001, BA admitted that its initial estimates may have been incorrect, and that they now valued Go at £200 million. Go was sold later that year for £100 million in a management buyout led by Cassani with the support of private equity firm 3i. The airline&#x27;s management team remained in place. In 2001, Go reported that it had carried 57.3% more passengers that year than in 2000.

In 2002, EasyJet announced that it would buy Go for £374 million to expand its own operations. By December of that year, Go was operating under the easyJet Air Operators Certificate (AOC) and was absorbed into the EasyJet brand the following year. Although it was reported that Cassani might seek to block the deal with EasyJet, this did not happen. She did not accept a position with the new entity, and in November 2003, Barbara Cassani published &quot;Go, An Airline Adventure&quot;, which chronicled the airline&#x27;s existence.

<text>Anselme Payen (; 6 January 1795 – 12 May 1871) was a French chemist known for discovering the enzyme diastase, and the carbohydrate cellulose.

==Biography==
Payen was born in Paris. He began studying science with his father when he was a 13-year-old, and later studied Chemistry at the École Polytechnique under the chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin and Michel Eugène Chevreul.

At the age of 23, Payen became manager of a borax-refining factory, where he developed a process for synthesizing borax from soda and boric acid. Previously, all borax had been imported from the East Indies exclusively by the Dutch. Payen&#x27;s new method of synthesizing borax allowed him to sell the mineral at one third the going price, and break the Dutch monopoly.

Payen also developed processes for refining sugar, along with a way to refine starch and alcohol from potatoes, and a method for determination of nitrogen. Payen invented a decolorimeter, which dealt with the analysis, decolorization, bleaching, and crystallization of sugar.

Payen discovered the first enzyme, diastase, in 1833. He is also known for isolating and naming the carbohydrate cellulose.

In 1835, Payen became a professor at École Centrale Paris. He was later elected professor at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers. He died in Paris on May 13, 1871.

==Legacy==
The American Chemical Society&#x27;s Cellulose and Renewable Materials Division has established an annual award in his honor, the Anselme Payen Award.

<doc id="57567" wikidata="Q244753" url="?curid=57567" title="Golden goal">
<text>The golden goal is a sports rule used in association football, Australian rules football, bandy, field hockey, ice hockey, lacrosse, and rugby league to decide the winner of a match (typically a knock-out match) in which scores are equal at the end of regular time. It is a type of sudden death. Under this rule, the game ends when a goal is scored; the team that scores that goal during extra time is the winner. Introduced formally in 1993, though with some history before that, the rule ceased to apply to most FIFA-authorized football games in 2004. The similar silver goal supplemented the golden goal between 2002 and 2004.

The golden goal was played in NCAA soccer matches up to 2021, was eliminated in 2022, and then reinstated for post-season play in 2024. It is still used in FIH sanctioned field hockey games. A related concept, the golden point, is used in National Rugby League games. A similar golden goal rule is also used in all National Hockey League (NHL) overtime games (followed by a shootout if needed, in the regular season and preseason); however, the term &quot;golden goal&quot; is not used. A rule similar to the golden goal also applies in National Football League regular season games (only if a touchdown or safety is scored, or any score on any possession after the first possession unless both teams score a field goal in the first two possessions then the game becomes true sudden death), although again the term itself is not used.

==Association football==
===Historical context===
The rules of the first known organized inter-club tournament in any code of football, the English Youdan Cup of 1867, featured a sudden-death rule. If scores were tied after 90 minutes, up to an hour of extra time was played, with the first team to score a goal or rouge being declared the winner. This rule came into effect in the second round tie between Norfolk FC and Broomhall FC played on 23 February 1867, when Norfolk scored a goal after two minutes of extra time to win the match, 1–0.

A similar rule was used the following year in the Cromwell Cup, which like the Youdan Cup was played under Sheffield Rules. In the final of this competition, played at Bramall Lane, Sheffield in 1868, the deciding goal was scored by the then newly formed team called The Wednesday, now known as Sheffield Wednesday.

The golden goal was introduced due to perceived failings of other means of resolving a draw (tie) in round-robin or knock-out tournaments where a winner is required. In particular, extra time periods can be tense and unentertaining as sides are too tired and nervous to attack, preferring to defend and play for penalties; whilst penalty shootouts are often described as based upon luck, and unrepresentative of football. FIFA introduced the golden goal rule in 1993. It was hoped that the golden goal would produce more attacking play during extra time, and would reduce the number of penalty shootouts.

===FIFA competitions===

The term &quot;golden goal&quot; was introduced by FIFA in 1993 along with the rule change because the alternative term, &quot;sudden death&quot;, was perceived to have negative connotations. In a knockout competition, following a draw, two fifteen-minute periods of extra time are played. If either team scores a goal during extra time, the game ends immediately and the scoring team becomes the winner. The winning goal is known as the &quot;golden goal&quot;. If there have been no goals scored after both periods of extra time, a penalty shoot-out decides the game. The golden goal was not compulsory, and individual competitions using extra time could choose whether to apply it during extra time. The first European Championship played with the rule was in 1996, as was the first MLS Cup that year; the first World Cup played with the rule was in 1998.

The first golden goal recorded was on 13 March 1993 by Australia against Uruguay in a quarter-final match of the World Youth Championship. The first major tournament final to be decided by such a goal was the 1995 Football League Trophy, where Birmingham City beat Carlisle United 1–0, with a goal from Paul Tait, followed by the 1996 European Championship final, won by Germany over the Czech Republic. The golden goal in this final was scored by Oliver Bierhoff. In MLS Cup 1996, Eddie Pope scored 3:25 into extra time as D.C. United beat the LA Galaxy 3–2. The first golden goal in World Cup history took place in 1998, as Laurent Blanc scored to enable France to defeat Paraguay in the round of 16.

In a qualification game for the 1994 Caribbean Cup, Barbados deliberately scored a late own goal in a successful attempt to qualify for the finals by forcing golden-goal extra time against Grenada, as an unusual tournament rule stated that golden goals counted double in calculating goal difference. Needing a two-goal victory to qualify, Barbados found themselves 2–1 up with three minutes left of normal time. After the Barbadians scored an own goal to bring the scoreline level at 2–2, Grenada tried to score in either net while Barbados defended both goals for the final three minutes of normal time. Barbados won the game in extra time and advanced to the next round.

In 2000, France defeated Italy in extra time in the 2000 European Championship final when David Trezeguet scored a golden goal. France thus became the first holder of both the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship since West Germany in 1974.

Also in 2000, Galatasaray had a 2–1 victory over Real Madrid in the 2000 UEFA Super Cup in Stade Louis II. The 90 minutes had produced a 1-1 draw and in extra time the Brazilian player Mário Jardel scored the golden goal and won the first ever UEFA Super Cup in club history.

The following year, Liverpool overcame Deportivo Alavés in the UEFA Cup final with a golden own goal by Delfí Geli to make the score 5–4 to Liverpool.

The UEFA Champions League is one of few tournaments not to have been settled by a &#x27;golden goal&#x27;.

The golden goal was used in the FIFA World Cup for the last time in 2002, when Turkey defeated Senegal in the quarter-finals when İlhan Mansız scored what would be the final golden goal in male tournaments. However, the 2003 Women&#x27;s World Cup final was decided by a golden goal as Germany defeated Sweden 2–1 with a header by Nia Künzer in the 98th minute. It was the last golden goal in FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup history.

====Silver goal====
For the 2002–03 season, UEFA introduced a new rule, the silver goal, to decide a competitive match. If a team leads after the first fifteen-minute half of extra time, it is the winner, but the game no longer ends the instant a team scores like it did under golden goal. Competitions that operated extra time would be able to decide whether to use the golden goal, the silver goal, or neither procedure. The silver goal was seen as a means to &quot;reduce the odds of a penalty shoot-out without the immediate jeopardy (and perceived unfairness) of Golden Goal&quot; as it gave the losing team the remainder of the first fifteen-minute period of extra time to make a comeback.

On 27 August 2003, Dutch club Ajax qualified for the group stage of the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League by virtue of the silver goal against Austrian club GAK after the two legs finished 1–1 each after 90 minutes. In extra time, Ajax was able to take advantage of GAK having two players sent off when Tomáš Galásek scored from a penalty in the 103rd minute.

Less than a year later on 1 July 2004, Galásek was on the field when the silver goal was featured in the only major competitive match to be decided by a silver goal: that of the semi-final match at Euro 2004 between Greece and the Czech Republic. However, the silver goal would eliminate the Czech Republic as Traianos Dellas scored for Greece after a corner kick in the last two seconds of the first period of extra time. The Czech team has been known for their come-from-behind wins earlier in the tournament against Latvia, Netherlands, and Germany, but the extremely late Greek score left the Czechs no chance to equalize. On the other hand if the Greeks had scored at the start of either period of extra time, the Czechs would have a decent opportunity to come back in the match. As well as being the only silver goal ever seen in an international match, it was also the only goal Dellas ever scored in his international career.

===Abolition===
Although both the golden goal and silver goal had their fans, both were also widely perceived as failed experiments. The golden goal in particular had not brought about more active and attacking play as originally intended and instead led to more cautious play along with furious angry reactions from a lot of players on the losing side. The silver goal, while in theory giving the remainder of the first fifteen-minute period of extra time to make a comeback, nonetheless could still effectively end the game if scored near the end of that period. Furthermore, there was also confusion about when events could choose among several different extra time rules.

In February 2004, the IFAB announced that, after Euro 2004, both the golden goal and silver goal methods would be removed from the Laws of the Game. Since the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, the golden goal has never been used in the event of a drawn match during the knockout stage, as FIFA restored the previous rules: in the event of a drawn game after the regular 90 minutes, two straight 15-minute periods of extra time are played. If scores remain level, the winner is decided by a penalty shoot-out.

The golden goal rule was abolished in NCAA soccer in 2022, used the FIFA overtime procedure as above, but was reinstated for post-season play in 2024. The championship games of the 1995, 1996, 2002, and 2013 women&#x27;s tournaments were decided by a golden goal; this situation also happened in the men&#x27;s tournament in 2017 and 2020.

==Other sports==
===Australian rules football===
Prior to a rule change in 2016, the Australian Football League (AFL) replayed the entire AFL Grand Final if the game was tied at the end of regular time. This was known as a grand final replay and occurred three times in the AFL (1948, 1977, 2010). Because of the inconvenience of this, from the 2016 AFL season onwards drawn grand finals were then to be resolved with two five-minute periods of extra time; if the scores are still tied at the end of the extra time period, play would continues until the next score. This was removed after the 2019 season, with level scores after an initial two three-minute extra time periods to be determined instead by further periods of extra time. Golden goal was never used in the four years it was part of the rules.

===Bandy===
At the 2022 Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship, the final of Pool B (second division) was decided by a golden goal.

===Field hockey===
International field hockey tournaments such as the Hockey World Cup and Champions Trophy had used golden goals to decide the winners of elimination matches. During these matches, two extra periods of minutes each were played, and if no golden goals were scored after both periods of extra time, a penalty stroke competition decided the game. FIH, the sport&#x27;s governing body, did away with the overtime procedure in 2013, and now teams go directly to the shootout.

===Ice hockey===
The golden goal rule comes into use at the end of regulation of every National Hockey League game where the score is tied. In the regular season, five minutes of three-on-three sudden-death overtime are played, with the first goal winning the game. If, however, neither team scores after this period, a shootout determines the winner. In playoff games, shootouts are not used; 20-minute periods of five-on-five hockey are played until a goal is scored to end the game. This has resulted in extremely long contests, such as the &quot;Easter Epic&quot;, a playoff series-deciding match which ended in the midst of its fourth overtime. The term &quot;golden goal&quot; is not a commonly used term in hockey, rather the winning goal is known as an &quot;overtime winner&quot; or &quot;overtime goal,&quot; while the format is known as &quot;sudden death&quot; in the NHL and &quot;sudden victory&quot; in college.

The Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament used the golden goal rule only in the gold medal game, with a 20-minute period of 5-on-5. The game ended if a goal is scored; otherwise, a penalty shootout determined the winner. This method was used to determine the 2010 men&#x27;s final, where Sidney Crosby scored the game-winning goal 7:40 into overtime. As that goal won Canada the Gold Medal, it has become known as &quot;The Golden Goal.&quot; Another happened at the 2014 women&#x27;s final, as Marie-Philip Poulin scored at 8:10 of overtime for Canada. In both instances, the team they beat was the United States. The two teams met in the rematch four years later, and lasted the whole 20-minute overtime without a goal before the United States prevailed in a shootout for their first gold in 20 years. Jocelyne Lamoureux scored in the sixth round of the shootout while Meghan Agosta failed. Kirill Kaprizov scored at 9:40 of overtime as the Russian Olympic Committee beat Germany in the 2018 men&#x27;s final. Since 2022, the overtime procedure changed to multiple 20-minute periods of 3-on-3, until one team scores, and applies to both genders.

===Rugby league===
A &quot;Golden point&quot; system, whereby a rugby league game whose 80 minutes have ended in a draw is decided by whichever team scores the first point (by whatever means) during a period of extra time is the winner. It was first used in 1997&#x27;s Super League Tri-series.

<text>The Cure are an English rock band formed in Crawley in 1976 by Robert Smith (vocals, guitar) and Lol Tolhurst (drums). The band&#x27;s current line-up comprises Smith, Perry Bamonte (guitar), Reeves Gabrels (guitar), Simon Gallup (bass), Roger O&#x27;Donnell (keyboards), and Jason Cooper (drums). Smith has remained the only constant member throughout numerous line-up changes since the band&#x27;s formation, including stints with guitarist Porl Thompson and drummer Boris Williams, though Gallup was absent for just six years of the band&#x27;s history.

The Cure&#x27;s debut album &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot; (1979), along with several early singles, placed the band at the forefront of the emerging post-punk and new wave movements that were gaining prominence in the United Kingdom. The band adopted a new and increasingly dark and tormented style beginning with their second album &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; (1980), which, together with Smith&#x27;s fashion sense, had a strong influence on the emerging genre of gothic rock and the goth subculture that eventually formed around it. Smith drove the band&#x27;s music toward a more pop-oriented sound with the release of their fourth album &quot;Pornography&quot; (1982), leading them to worldwide mainstream success. The band reached their commercial peak with the albums &quot;Disintegration&quot; (1989) and &quot;Wish&quot; (1992).

The Cure have released 14 studio albums, two EPs, and over 40 singles, selling more than 30 million records worldwide. Their singles compilation &quot;Standing on a Beach&quot; (1986) sold 4 million copies worldwide by 1989. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. Their 14th album &quot;Songs of a Lost World&quot; (2024) was their first release of all-new material in 16 years and received widespread acclaim, topping the charts in multiple countries (including the UK, their first number one album in the country since 1992) and becoming one of the year&#x27;s fastest-selling albums.

==History==
===1973–1979: Formation and early years===
The founding members of the Cure were school friends at Notre Dame Middle School in Crawley. They first performed in public at an end-of-year show in April 1973 as members of a one-off school band called Obelisk. That band consisted of Robert Smith on piano, Michael Dempsey on guitar, Lol Tolhurst on percussion, Marc Ceccagno on lead guitar, and Alan Hill on bass. In January 1976, while at St Wilfrid&#x27;s Comprehensive School, Ceccagno formed a five-piece rock band with Smith on guitar and Dempsey on bass, along with two other school friends. They called themselves Malice and rehearsed David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix and Alex Harvey songs in a local church hall. By late April 1976, Ceccagno and the other two members had left, and Tolhurst (drums), Martin Creasy (vocals), and Porl Thompson (guitar) had joined the band. This lineup played all three of Malice&#x27;s only documented live shows during December 1976. In January 1977, following Creasy&#x27;s departure, and increasingly influenced by the emergence of punk rock, Malice&#x27;s remaining members became known as Easy Cure – after a song written by Tolhurst.

After winning a talent competition, Easy Cure signed a recording contract with German record label Ariola-Hansa on 18 May 1977. In September 1977, Peter O&#x27;Toole (no relation to the actor), who had been the group&#x27;s vocalist for several months, left the group to live on a kibbutz in Israel. The band auditioned several vocalists that month before Smith assumed the role. The new four-piece of Dempsey, Smith, Thompson, and Tolhurst recorded their first studio demo sessions as Easy Cure for Hansa at SAV Studios in London in October and November 1977. None were ever released.

The band continued to perform regularly around Crawley (including the Rocket, St Edward&#x27;s, and Queen&#x27;s Square in particular) throughout 1977 and 1978. On 19 February 1978 they were joined at the Rocket for the first time by a support band from Horley called Lockjaw, featuring bassist Simon Gallup. Hansa, dissatisfied with the group&#x27;s demos, did not wish to release their original song &quot;Killing an Arab&quot;. The label suggested that the band attempt cover versions instead. They refused, and by March 1978 Easy Cure&#x27;s contract with the label had been dissolved. Smith later recalled, &quot;We were very young. They just thought they could turn us into a teen group. They actually wanted us to do cover versions and we always refused.&quot;

On 22 April 1978, Easy Cure played their last gig at the Montefiore Institute Hall (in the Three Bridges neighbourhood of Crawley) before guitarist Porl Thompson was dropped from the lineup because his lead-guitar style was at odds with Smith&#x27;s growing preference for minimalist songwriting. Smith soon renamed the remaining trio the Cure. Later that month the band recorded their first sessions as a trio at Chestnut Studios in Sussex, producing a demo tape for distribution to a dozen major record labels. The demo found its way to Polydor Records scout Chris Parry, who signed the Cure to his newly formed Fiction label – distributed by Polydor – in September 1978. The Cure released their debut single &quot;Killing an Arab&quot; in December 1978 on the Small Wonder label as a stopgap until Fiction finalised distribution arrangements with Polydor. &quot;Killing an Arab&quot; garnered both acclaim and controversy. While the single&#x27;s provocative title led to accusations of racism, the song is based on French author Albert Camus&#x27;s novel &quot;The Stranger&quot;. The band placed stickers that denied the racist connotations on the single&#x27;s 1979 reissue on Fiction. An early &quot;NME&quot; article on the band wrote that the Cure &quot;are like a breath of fresh suburban air on the capital&#x27;s smog-ridden pub-and-club circuit,&quot; and noted: &quot;With a John Peel session and more extensive London gigging on their immediate agenda, it remains to be seen whether the Cure can retain their refreshing joie de vivre.&quot;

The Cure released their debut album &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot; in May 1979. Because of the band&#x27;s inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges took control of the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted: &quot;a lot of it was very superficial – I didn&#x27;t even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we&#x27;d made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it.&quot; The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; &quot;Join Hands&quot; promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double-duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: &quot;On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I&#x27;d wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing.&quot;

The Cure&#x27;s third single, &quot;Jumping Someone Else&#x27;s Train&quot;, was released in October 1979. Soon afterwards, Dempsey was dropped from the band because of his cold reception to material Smith had written for the upcoming album. Dempsey joined the Associates, while Simon Gallup (bass) and Matthieu Hartley (keyboards) from the Magspies joined the Cure. The Associates toured as support band for the Cure and the Passions on the &quot;Future Pastimes Tour&quot; of England between November and December – all three bands were on the Fiction Records roster – with the new Cure line-up already performing a number of new songs for the projected second album. Meanwhile, a spin-off band comprising Smith, Tolhurst, Dempsey, Gallup, Hartley, and Thompson, with backing vocals from assorted family and friends and lead vocals provided by their local postman Frankie Bell, released a 7-inch single in December under the name Cult Hero.

===1980–1982: Early gothic phase===
Due to the band&#x27;s lack of creative control on their first album, Smith exerted a greater influence on the recording of their second album &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot;, which he co-produced with Mike Hedges. The album was released in 1980 and reached number 20 on the UK charts. A single from the album, &quot;A Forest&quot;, became the band&#x27;s first UK hit single, reaching number 31 on the singles chart. The album was a departure from the Cure&#x27;s sound up to that point, with Hedges describing it as &quot;morose, atmospheric, very different to &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot;.&quot; In its review of &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; the &quot;NME&quot; said, &quot;For a group as young as the Cure, it seems amazing that they have covered so much territory in such a brief time.&quot; At the same time, Smith became concerned about the concept of an alleged &quot;anti-image&quot;. Smith told the press he was fed up with the anti-image association that some considered to be &quot;elaborately disguising their plainness&quot;, stating, &quot;We had to get away from that anti-image thing, which we didn&#x27;t even create in the first place. And it seemed like we were trying to be more obscure. We just didn&#x27;t like the standard rock thing. The whole thing really got out of hand.&quot; That same year &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot; was repackaged for the American market as &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, with new artwork and a modified track list. The Cure set out on their first world tour to promote both releases. At the end of the tour, Matthieu Hartley left the band. Hartley said, &quot;I realised that the group was heading towards suicidal, sombre music – the sort of thing that didn&#x27;t interest me at all.&quot;

The band reconvened with Hedges to produce their third album, &quot;Faith&quot; (1981), which furthered the dour mood present on &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot;. The album peaked at number 14 on the UK charts. Included with cassette copies of &quot;Faith&quot; was an instrumental soundtrack for &quot;Carnage Visors&quot;, an animated film shown in place of an opening act for the band&#x27;s 1981 Picture Tour. In late 1981 the Cure released the non-album single &quot;Charlotte Sometimes&quot;. By this point, the sombre mood of the music had a profound effect on the attitude of the band and they were &quot;stuck in a ghoulish rut&quot;. Sometimes Smith would be so absorbed by the persona he projected onstage that he would leave at the end in tears.

In 1982 the Cure recorded and released &quot;Pornography&quot;, the third and final album of an &quot;oppressively dispirited&quot; trio that cemented the Cure&#x27;s stature as one of the purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of &quot;Pornography&quot; he was &quot;undergoing a lot of mental stress. But it had nothing to do with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about &quot;Pornography&quot;. Looking back and getting other people&#x27;s opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time&quot;. Gallup described the album by saying, &quot;Nihilism took over ... We sang &#x27;It doesn&#x27;t matter if we all die&#x27; and that is exactly what we thought at the time.&quot; Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track &quot;The Hanging Garden&quot; for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album&#x27;s uncommercial sound, &quot;Pornography&quot; became the band&#x27;s first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight.

The release of &quot;Pornography&quot; was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, in which the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair, and smeared lipstick on their faces. Simon Gallup left the Cure at the tour&#x27;s conclusion after a bar fight with Smith; the two did not talk to each other for the following eighteen months. Smith then placed the Cure on hold and rejoined Siouxsie and the Banshees as their lead guitarist in November 1982. He subsequently became a full-time member of that band, and was featured on the live video and album &quot;Nocturne&quot;. He then recorded the album &quot;Hyæna&quot; with them, but left the group two weeks before its June 1984 release to concentrate on the Cure.

===1983–1988: Commercial success===
With Gallup&#x27;s departure from the Cure and Smith&#x27;s work with Siouxsie and the Banshees, rumours spread that the Cure had broken up. In December 1982, Smith remarked to &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Do the Cure really exist any more? I&#x27;ve been pondering that question myself ... it has got to a point where I don&#x27;t fancy working in that format again.&quot; He added, &quot;Whatever happens, it won&#x27;t be me, Laurence and Simon together any more. I know that.&quot;

Parry was concerned about the state of his label&#x27;s top band, and became convinced that the solution was for the Cure to reinvent its musical style. Parry managed to convince Smith and Tolhurst of the idea; Parry said, &quot;It appealed to Robert because he wanted to destroy the Cure anyway.&quot; With Tolhurst now playing keyboards instead of drums, the duo released the single &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot; in late 1982. While Smith wrote the single as a throwaway, &quot;stupid&quot; pop song to the press, it became a minor hit in the UK, reaching number 44 on the singles chart, and entered the Top 20 in Australia and New Zealand. It was followed in 1983 by two more successful songs: the synthesiser-based &quot;The Walk&quot; which reached number 12, and &quot;The Love Cats&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s first British Top 10 hit, reaching number seven. These singles and their B-sides were compiled on the &quot;Japanese Whispers&quot; compilation, which was released in December 1983.
In 1984, the Cure released &quot;The Top&quot;, a generally psychedelic album on which Smith played most of the instruments except drums (played by Andy Anderson) and saxophone (played by early Malice member Porl Thompson, who then officially joined the Cure). The album was a Top 10 hit in the UK, and was their first studio album to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US, reaching number 180. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised the album as &quot;psychedelia that can&#x27;t be dated&quot;, while pondering, &quot;I&#x27;ve yet to meet anyone who can tell me why the Cure are having hits now of all times.&quot; The Cure then embarked on their worldwide Top Tour with Thompson and Anderson, along with Phil Thornalley who had produced &quot;The Top&quot; and assumed bass duties for live performances. Released in late 1984, the Cure&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Concert&quot;, consisted of performances from this tour. Near the tour&#x27;s end, Anderson was fired for destructive behaviour, and was temporarily replaced for a few shows by Vince Ely of the Psychedelic Furs. The drummer position was then officially filled by Boris Williams, who had previously been the touring drummer for Thompson Twins. Ely and Williams had both been recommended by Phil Thornalley, from his previous experiences as a producer and engineer. Soon thereafter, Thornalley also left because of the stress of touring. Former Cure bassist Simon Gallup, who had formed the band Fools Dance in the interim, rejoined the Cure after roadie Gary Biddles brokered a reconciliation between Gallup and Smith. Smith was ecstatic about Gallup&#x27;s return and declared to &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a group again.&quot;

In 1985, the new line-up of Smith, Tolhurst, Gallup, Williams, and Thompson (now on guitar and keyboards) released &quot;The Head on the Door&quot;, an album that managed to bind together the optimistic and pessimistic aspects of the band&#x27;s music between which they had previously shifted. &quot;The Head on the Door&quot; reached number seven in the UK and number 59 in the US, a success partly due to the international impact of the album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;In Between Days&quot; and &quot;Close to Me&quot;. Following the album and world tour, the band released the singles compilation &quot;Standing on a Beach&quot; in three formats (each with a different track listing and a specific title) in 1986. This compilation made the US top 50, and saw the re-issue of three previous singles: &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (in a new form), &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot; and, later, &quot;Charlotte Sometimes&quot;. This release was accompanied by a VHS and LaserDisc &quot;Staring at the Sea&quot;, which featured videos for each track on the compilation. The Cure toured to support the compilation and released a live concert VHS and LaserDisc of the show, filmed in the south of France and called &quot;The Cure in Orange&quot;. During this time, the band became very popular in Europe (particularly in France, Germany, and the Benelux countries) and increasingly popular in both the US and Canada.

The band kicked off 1987 by performing in Buenos Aires, Argentina, becoming one of the first British alternative rock bands to perform a large-scale concert there. The concert ended in a riot after fans who had purchased counterfeit tickets were denied entry to the venue. The Cure did not play in Argentina again until 2013.

In May, the Cure released the eclectic double album &quot;Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me&quot;, which reached number six in the UK, the top 10 in several countries, and was the band&#x27;s first entry into the US top 40 at number 35; the album was also certified platinum in the US. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;, was the band&#x27;s most successful single to date in the US, being their first to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40. The album produced three other hit singles. After the album&#x27;s release, the band recruited Roger O&#x27;Donnell, previously the touring keyboardist for the Psychedelic Furs and a longtime friend of Williams, to supplement the work of Tolhurst while allowing Thompson to focus on guitar. During the subsequent tour, Tolhurst&#x27;s alcohol consumption began to interfere with his ability to perform.

===1989–1993: &quot;Disintegration&quot; and worldwide stardom===
In 1989, the Cure released the album &quot;Disintegration&quot;, which was critically praised and became their highest-charting album to date, entering at number three in the UK and featuring three Top 30 singles in the UK and Germany: &quot;Lullaby&quot;, &quot;Lovesong&quot; and &quot;Pictures of You&quot;. &quot;Disintegration&quot; also reached number 12 on the US charts. The first single in the US, &quot;Fascination Street&quot;, reached number one on the American Modern Rock chart, but was quickly overshadowed by its third US single, &quot;Lovesong&quot;, which reached number two on the American pop charts (the only Cure single to reach the US Top 10). By 1992, &quot;Disintegration&quot; had sold over three million copies worldwide.

During the &quot;Disintegration&quot; sessions, the band gave Smith an ultimatum that either Tolhurst would have to leave the band or they would. In February 1989, Tolhurst&#x27;s exit was made official and announced to the press; this resulted in O&#x27;Donnell becoming a full-fledged member of the band and left Smith as the Cure&#x27;s only remaining founding member. Smith attributed Tolhurst&#x27;s dismissal to an inability to exert himself and issues with alcohol, concluding, &quot;He was out of step with everything. It had just become detrimental to everything we&#x27;d do.&quot; Because Tolhurst was still on the payroll during the recording of &quot;Disintegration&quot;, he is credited in the album&#x27;s liner notes as playing &quot;other instruments&quot; and is listed as a co-writer of every song; however, it has since been revealed that while Tolhurst had contributed to the song &quot;Homesick&quot;, his contributions to the rest of the album were minimal due to his alcoholism.

The Cure then embarked on a successful tour which saw the band playing stadiums in the US. On 6 September 1989, the Cure performed &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. In May 1990, O&#x27;Donnell quit and was replaced by Perry Bamonte, who played both keyboards and guitar and had been a member of the band&#x27;s road crew since 1984. That November, the Cure released a collection of remixes called &quot;Mixed Up&quot;. The one new song on the collection, &quot;Never Enough&quot;, was released as a single. In 1991, the Cure were awarded the Brit Award for Best British Group. That same year, Tolhurst filed a lawsuit against Smith and Fiction Records over royalties payments and claimed that he and Smith jointly owned the name &quot;The Cure&quot;; the lawsuit finally ended in 1994 in favour of Smith. In the meantime, the band returned to the studio to record their next album. &quot;Wish&quot; (1992) reached number one in the UK and number two in the US and yielded the international hits &quot;High&quot; and &quot;Friday I&#x27;m in Love&quot;. The album was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1993. In the autumn of 1993, the band released two live albums, &quot;Show&quot; and &quot;Paris&quot;, featuring recordings from concerts on their world &quot;Wish&quot; tour.

===1994–1998: Transition===
In 1994 the band composed the original song &quot;Burn&quot; for the soundtrack to the movie &quot;The Crow&quot;, which went to number one on the Billboard 200 album charts. Between the release of &quot;Wish&quot; and the start of sessions for the Cure&#x27;s next studio album, the band&#x27;s line-up shifted again. Porl Thompson left the band to tour with Page and Plant and was not replaced, while Boris Williams quit and was replaced by new drummer Jason Cooper (formerly of My Life Story). After a four-year absence, Roger O&#x27;Donnell returned to play keyboards. The sessions for their next album began in 1994 with only Robert Smith and Perry Bamonte present; Simon Gallup then returned from a health-related leave of absence, after which Cooper and O&#x27;Donnell joined the sessions.

&quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot;, finally released in 1996, was poorly received compared with previous albums and marked the end of the band&#x27;s commercial peak. Early in 1996, the Cure played festivals in South America, followed by a world tour in support of the album. In 1997 the band released &quot;Galore&quot;, a compilation album containing all of their singles released between 1987 and 1997, as well as the new single &quot;Wrong Number&quot;, which featured longtime David Bowie guitarist Reeves Gabrels. In 1998 the Cure contributed the song &quot;More Than This&quot; to the soundtrack for &quot;The X-Files&quot; film, as well as a cover of &quot;World in My Eyes&quot; for the Depeche Mode tribute album &quot;For the Masses&quot;.

===1999–2005: The Trilogy and more personnel changes===
With only one album left in their record contract and with commercial response to &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; and the &quot;Galore&quot; compilation lacklustre, Smith once again considered that the end of the Cure might be near and thus wanted to make an album that reflected the more serious side of the band. The Grammy-nominated album &quot;Bloodflowers&quot; was released in 2000 after being delayed since 1998. According to Smith, the album was the third of a trilogy along with &quot;Pornography&quot; and &quot;Disintegration&quot;. The band embarked on the nine-month Dream Tour, which included 20 dates in the United States. In 2001, the Cure left Fiction and released their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album and DVD, which featured the music videos for a number of their songs. The band released &quot;The Cure: Trilogy&quot; as a double live album video, on two double layer DVD-9 discs, and later on a single Blu-ray disc. It documents the Trilogy Concerts, in which the three albums &quot;– Pornography&quot;, &quot;Disintegration,&quot; and &quot;Bloodflowers&quot; &quot;–&quot; were played live in their entirety one after the other each night, the songs being played in the order in which they appeared on the albums. &quot;Trilogy&quot; was recorded on two consecutive nights, 11–12 November 2002, at the Tempodrom Arena in Berlin.
In 2003, the Cure signed with Geffen Records. In 2004, they released a new four-disc boxed set on Fiction Records titled &quot;Join the Dots: B-Sides &amp; Rarities, 1978–2001 (The Fiction Years)&quot;. The album peaked at number 106 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. The band released their twelfth album, &quot;The Cure&quot;, on Geffen in 2004. It made a top ten debut on both sides of the Atlantic in July 2004. To promote the album, the band headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival that May. From 24 July to 29 August, the Cure headlined the &quot;Curiosa&quot; concert tour of North America, which was formatted as a traveling festival and also featured Interpol, the Rapture, Mogwai, Muse, and Thursday, among other groups. While attendances were lower than expected, &quot;Curiosa&quot; was still one of the more successful American summer festivals of 2004. The same year the band was honoured with an MTV Icon award in a television special presented by Marilyn Manson.

In May 2005, O&#x27;Donnell and Bamonte were fired from the band. O&#x27;Donnell claims Smith informed him he was reducing the band to a three-piece. Previously O&#x27;Donnell said he had only found out about the band&#x27;s upcoming tour dates via a fan site and added, &quot;It was sad to find out after nearly twenty years the way I did, but then I should have expected no less or more.&quot; The remaining members of the band &quot;–&quot; Smith, Gallup and Cooper &quot;–&quot; made several appearances as a trio before Porl Thompson returned to the Cure&#x27;s lineup for their summer 2005 tour. In July 2005, the band performed a set at the Paris concert of the Live 8 series of benefit concerts.

===2006–2015: &quot;4:13 Dream&quot; and Reflections===
The Cure began writing and recording material for their thirteenth album in 2006. The Cure postponed their autumn 2007 North American 4Tour in August to continue working on the album, rescheduling the dates for spring 2008. The group released four singles and an EP &quot;–&quot; &quot;The Only One&quot;, &quot;Freakshow&quot;, &quot;Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead&quot;, &quot;The Perfect Boy&quot; and &quot;Hypnagogic States&quot; respectively &quot;–&quot; on or near to the 13th of each month, in the months leading up to the album&#x27;s release. Released in October 2008, &quot;4:13 Dream&quot; was a commercial failure in the UK compared to their previous album releases, only staying in the charts two weeks and not peaking higher than number 33. In February 2009, the Cure received the 2009 Shockwaves NME Award for Godlike Genius.
O&#x27;Donnell officially rejoined the Cure in 2011 before the band performed at the Vivid Sydney festival in Australia. This concert was the first in their Reflections concert series, in which they performed their first three albums in their entireties. The band performed seven additional Reflections concerts in 2011, one in London, three in New York City and three in Los Angeles. On 27 September, the Cure was announced as a nominee for 2012 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s cover article for March 2012, the Cure announced that they would be headlining a series of summer music festivals across Europe, including the Leeds/Reading Festival. On 1 May, Porl Thompson announced that he had left the Cure for the second time. On 26 May, the Cure embarked on a 19-date summer festival tour of Europe, commencing at the Pinkpop Festival, joined by Reeves Gabrels on guitar. On the same day, it was announced that Gabrels would be standing in for the tour, but at that point was not a full-fledged member of the band. Several weeks into the tour, the band invited Gabrels to become a member and he accepted. In 2013, the Cure toured South America, where they had not performed since 1987 apart from two 1996 concerts in Brazil.

In early 2014, Smith announced that the band would release a follow-up to &quot;4:13 Dream&quot; later that year titled &quot;4:14 Scream&quot;. The releases would be compiled together as a double album named &quot;4:26 Dream.&quot; However, this project was eventually abandoned. The Cure paid tribute to Paul McCartney on the album titled &quot;The Art of McCartney&quot;, which was released on 18 November 2014. The Cure covered the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; which featured guest vocals and keyboards from Paul&#x27;s son James McCartney. A video of the band and James performing the song was released on 9 September 2014; it was filmed at Brighton Electric Studio in Brighton. Robert Smith also covered McCartney&#x27;s &quot;C Moon&quot; on the album&#x27;s bonus disc. In the summer of 2015, the &quot;Disintegration&quot; track &quot;Plainsong&quot; was featured in a humorous moment in the movie &quot;Ant-Man&quot;, but did not appear on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack.

=== 2017–present: &quot;Songs of a Lost World&quot; ===
In June 2018, the Cure headlined the 25th annual Meltdown Festival in London. Smith also selected the festival&#x27;s lineup, which included several of his personal favourite artists, including Nine Inch Nails, My Bloody Valentine, Deftones, Placebo, Manic Street Preachers, and Kristin Hersh, among others. On 7 July 2018, Cure performed a 40th anniversary concert at Hyde Park as part of the British Summer Time concert series. For Record Store Day 2018, the Cure released a remastered, deluxe edition of &quot;Mixed Up&quot;, along with a sequel titled &quot;Torn Down&quot; featuring 16 new remixes all created by Robert Smith.

In a 30 March 2019 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Smith commented on the band&#x27;s next album, saying, &quot;For the first time in 20 years, we went into a studio – we actually went into the studio where they Queen] did &#x27;Bohemian Rhapsody&#x27;. The songs are like 10 minutes, 12 minutes long. We recorded 19 songs. So I have no idea what to do now... We&#x27;ll finish it before we start in the summer, and it&#x27;ll be mixed through the summer. And then so release date, I don&#x27;t know, October? Halloween! Come on!&quot; In an interview published on 5 July in &quot;NME&quot;, he noted that the band would be re-recording three or four songs in August 2019 but that, &quot;I feel intent on it being a 2019 release and would be extremely bitter if it isn&#x27;t.&quot; The year passed with no new studio release, as did the following four years.

In 2019, the Cure embarked on a 23-date summer tour, consisting mostly of festival performances along with four dates in Sydney, Australia. The final Sydney show on 30 May was live-streamed. The band performed at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in October 2019. Later that same month, the band issued &quot;40 Live: CURÆTION-25 + Anniversary&quot;, a Blu-ray, DVD and CD box set featuring their Meltdown and Hyde Park performances from 2018 in their entireties.

In interviews in June 2021, Smith referenced the recording of two new Cure albums, saying &quot;One of them&#x27;s very, very doom and gloom and the other one isn&#x27;t,&quot; and that the recordings have been completed, &quot;I just have to decide who&#x27;s going to mix them.&quot; On 15 August 2021, bassist Simon Gallup posted on his social media that he had left the Cure. No official statement concerning his departure was made by Smith or the band and Gallup subsequently deleted the post. On 14 October 2021, Gallup confirmed that he was still in the band.

In March 2022, Smith confirmed that the first of the band&#x27;s two projected new albums would be titled &quot;Songs of a Lost World&quot;. An update was provided in May 2022, when Smith claimed that the album would be released prior to the band&#x27;s European tour in October 2022. This, however, did not happen, as the tour got underway with no new album being released, although new material was performed. Perry Bamonte returned to the band for their Lost World tour beginning with their 6 October 2022 concert in Riga, Latvia. In March 2023, the Cure announced a 30-date North American tour called Shows of a Lost World, set to take place in May through July, the band&#x27;s first full United States tour since 2016. Smith was outspoken against Ticketmaster&#x27;s dynamic pricing model and ticket scalpers, setting base prices as low as $20 before fees; he also negotiated with the company to issue partial refunds to fans who were subjected to excessive fees above the list price.

The Cure released a 12-inch single on 1 October 2024 featuring live recordings of two new songs, &quot;And Nothing Is Forever&quot; and &quot;I Can Never Say Goodbye&quot;, that were recorded at a concert in France in 2022.

In September 2024, the band began sending out cryptic postcard messages to fans who signed up for their mailing list along with a poster unveiled in a pub in Robert Smith&#x27;s hometown where the band played some of their earliest shows. On 26 September, the first single from the album, &quot;Alone&quot;, was released. The album was produced by Smith and Paul Corkett, who Smith previously worked with to produce &quot;Bloodflowers&quot;. &quot;Songs of a Lost World&quot;, their first studio album in sixteen years, was released on 1 November 2024. &quot;Songs of a Lost World&quot; reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, and was the Cure&#x27;s first chart-topping album since &quot;Wish&quot; in 1992. In the United States, &quot;Songs of a Lost World&quot; debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was the band&#x27;s first top ten album there since &quot;The Cure&quot; in 2004.

In October 2024, Smith said the Cure would release a follow-up album to &quot;Songs of a Lost World&quot; and tour in 2025, and would release a documentary in 2028. He also suggested that the Cure would retire in 2029, which would be the year he turns 70 and the 50th anniversary of their debut album &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot;.

The band have been nominated for the 2025 BRIT Awards for Mastercard Album of the Year, Alternative / Rock Act and Group of the Year.

==Musical style==

The Cure are often identified with the gothic rock genre, and are viewed as one of the form&#x27;s definitive bands. However, the band has routinely rejected classification, particularly as a gothic rock band. Robert Smith said in 2006, &quot;It&#x27;s so pitiful when &#x27;goth&#x27; is still tagged onto the name The Cure&quot;, and added, &quot;We&#x27;re not categorisable. I suppose we were post-punk when we came out, but in total it&#x27;s impossible ... I just play Cure music, whatever that is.&quot; While typically viewed as producers of dark and gloomy music, the Cure have also yielded a number of upbeat songs and been part of the new wave movement. &quot;Spin&quot; has said &quot;the Cure have always been an either/or sort of band: either ... Robert Smith is wallowing in gothic sadness or he&#x27;s licking sticky-sweet cotton-candy pop off his lipstick-stained fingers.&quot; In 2004, Smith observed, &quot;It&#x27;s always been paradoxical that it&#x27;s pushed down people&#x27;s throats that we&#x27;re a goth band. Because, to the general public, we&#x27;re not. To taxi drivers, I&#x27;m the bloke that sings &#x27;Friday I&#x27;m in Love&#x27;. I&#x27;m not the bloke who sings &#x27;Shake Dog Shake&#x27; or &#x27;One Hundred Years&#x27;.&quot;

The Cure&#x27;s primary musical traits have been listed as &quot;dominant, melodic bass lines; whiny, strangulated vocals; and a lyric obsession with existential, almost literary despair.&quot; Most Cure songs start with Smith and Gallup writing the drum patterns and bass lines. Both record demos at home and then bring them into the studio for fine-tuning. Smith said in 1992, &quot;I think when people talk about the &#x27;Cure sound&#x27;, they mean songs based on six-string bass, acoustic guitar and my voice, plus the string sound from the Solina.&quot; On top of this foundation is laid &quot;towering layers of guitars and synthesisers&quot;. Keyboards have been a component of the band&#x27;s sound since &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot;, and their importance increased with their extensive use on &quot;Disintegration&quot;.

==Music videos==
The band&#x27;s early music videos have been described as &quot;dreadful affairs&quot; and have been maligned for their poor quality, particularly by the band itself. Tolhurst said, &quot;Those videos were unmitigated disasters; we weren&#x27;t actors and our personalities weren&#x27;t coming across.&quot; The video for &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot; was their first collaboration with Tim Pope. The director added a playful element to the band&#x27;s videos; the director insisted in a 1987 &quot;Spin&quot; interview, &quot;I think that side of them was always there, but was never brought out.&quot;

Pope would go on to direct the majority of the Cure&#x27;s videos, which became synonymous with the band, and expanded their audience during the 1980s. Pope explained the appeal of working with the Cure by saying, &quot;the Cure is the ultimate band for a filmmaker to work with because Robert Smith really understands the camera. His songs are so cinematic. I mean on one level there&#x27;s this stupidity and humour, right, but beneath that there are all [Smith&#x27;s] psychological obsessions and claustrophobia.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Cure are often regarded as one of the most significant alternative artists of the 1980s. They were one of the first alternative bands to have chart and commercial success in an era before alternative rock had broken into the mainstream; in 1992, &quot;NME&quot; declared that the Cure had during the 1980s become &quot;a goth hit machine (19 to date), an international phenomenon and, yet, the most successful alternative band that ever shuffled disconsolately about the earth&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; dubbed the Cure the &quot;unlikeliest alt-rock heroes&quot; of the 1980s.

The Cure have influenced a number of musical artists spanning multiple genres. Artists who have cited their influence by or appreciation for the Cure include Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, Slowdive, Ride, My Bloody Valentine, Miki Berenyi of Lush, Britt Daniel of Spoon, Beach House, Chvrches, Blink-182, Interpol, Manic Street Preachers, AFI, Deftones, Placebo, Mogwai, Korn, Foals, Drab Majesty, Converge, Tim Kasher of Cursive, Geoff Rickly of Thursday, and Alvvays.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame chose the Cure for induction in its Class of 2019. Although the Cure had been eligible for the Hall of Fame since 2004, they were only nominated once previously, in 2012. The formal induction ceremony was held 29 March 2019 at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn, New York. The members named by the Rock Hall for induction as part of the band were Perry Bamonte, Jason Cooper, Michael Dempsey, Reeves Gabrels, Simon Gallup, Roger O&#x27;Donnell, Robert Smith, Porl Thompson, Lol Tolhurst, and Boris Williams. Gabrels was initially not included in the induction, but was added in February 2019. At the ceremony, the Cure were inducted by Trent Reznor before performing five songs.
