<text>Gettysburg (; ) is a borough in Pennsylvania and the county seat of Adams County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, the borough had a population of 7,106 people.

Gettysburg was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, which was fought in Gettysburg over three days from July 1 to July 3, 1863, during the American Civil War. With over 50,000 combined casualties, the Battle of Gettysburg is both the deadliest battle of the Civil War and in all of American history. The battle, which was won by the Union army, also proved the turning point of the war, leading to the Union&#x27;s victory two years later and the nation&#x27;s preservation. Later that year, on November 19, President Abraham Lincoln traveled to present-day Gettysburg National Cemetery, where he participated in a ceremonial consecration of the cemetery and delivered the Gettysburg Address, a carefully crafted 271-word address, which is considered one of the most famous speeches in history.

Gettysburg is home to the Gettysburg National Military Park, which includes Gettysburg Battlefield, where the Battle of Gettysburg was largely fought.

==History==

===18th century===

In 1760, Irishman Samuel Gettys settled at the Shippensburg-Baltimore and Philadelphia-Pittsburgh crossroads, in what was then western York County, and established a tavern frequented by soldiers and traders. In 1786, his son James purchased 116 acres of his land, divided it up into 220 lots and sold them, and is thus considered the founder of Gettysburgh. The borough boundary was established, with the Dobbin House tavern (established in 1776) sitting in the southwest.

Beginning in 1790, a movement seeking to split off the western portion of York County into a separate county had begun. A commission was drawn up to fix the site of the new county&#x27;s seat; they ultimately chose a location in Strabane Township (now Straban Township), just northeast of Gettysburg. In 1791, additional trustees were appointed to plan to construct public buildings in Gettysburg instead of in Straban. 

===19th century===
On January 22, 1800, the Pennsylvania Legislature created Adams County, and named Gettysburg as its county seat.

In 1858, the Gettysburg Railroad completed the construction of a railroad line from Gettysburg to Hanover, and the Gettysburg Railroad Station opened a year later. Passenger train service to the town ended in 1942. The station was restored in 2006. In 2011, Senator Robert Casey introduced S. 1897, including the railroad station within the boundary of Gettysburg National Military Park. By 1860, the borough had grown in size to consist of &quot;450 buildings [which] housed carriage manufacturing, shoemakers, and tanneries&quot;.

====Civil War====

Between July 1 and 3, 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg, one of the bloodiest battles during the American Civil War, was fought across the fields and heights surrounding the town.

The Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, under the command of Robert E Lee, experienced success in the early stages of the battle but was ultimately defeated by the Army of the Potomac, commanded by George G. Meade. Lee executed an orderly withdrawal and escaped across the Potomac River without being drawn into another battle. Meade was heavily criticized by President Abraham Lincoln for his cautious pursuit and failure to destroy Lee&#x27;s retreating army.

Casualties were high, with total losses on both sides – over 27,000 Confederate and 23,000 Union. The residents of Gettysburg were left to care for the wounded, and bury the dead following the Confederate retreat. Approximately 8,000 men and 3,000 horses lay under the summer sun. The Union soldiers&#x27; bodies were gradually reinterred in what is today known as Gettysburg National Cemetery, where, on November 19, 1863, Abraham Lincoln attended a ceremony to officially consecrate the grounds and delivered his Gettysburg Address.

A 20-year-old woman, Jennie Wade, was the only civilian killed during the battle. She was hit by a stray bullet that passed through her kitchen door while she was making bread on July 3.

Physical damage can still be seen in some of the houses throughout the town, notably the Schmucker House located on Seminary Ridge.

==Industry and economy==

The furniture manufacturing industry employed people in Gettysburg for the first half of the 20th century. The &quot;Gettysburg Manufacturing Company&quot;, formed in 1902, was the first company established in the borough for the purpose of manufacturing residential furniture. Other companies soon followed. The borough&#x27;s industry reached peak production and success about the 1920s. This important industry declined from 1951, when the three main companies either moved, closed or were sold. The Gettysburg Furniture Company factory closed in 1960, becoming a warehouse and distribution point for other furniture factories outside of Pennsylvania.

=== Tourism ===
Gettysburg manufacturing associated with tourism included a late 19th century foundry that manufactured gun carriages, bridgeworks and cannons for the Gettysburg Battlefield, as well as a construction industry for hotels, stables, and other buildings for tourist services. Early tourist buildings in the borough included museums (like the 1881 Danner Museum), souvenir shops, buildings of the electric trolley (preceded by a horse trolley from the Gettysburg Railroad Station to the Springs Hotel), and stands for hackmen who drove visitors in jitneys (horse-drawn group taxis) on tours. Modern tourist services in the borough include ghost tours, bed and breakfast lodging, and historical interpretation (reenactors, etc.).

Gettysburg National Military Park extends partially into the Gettysburg borough limits, though it is mostly in nearby Cumberland Township. The Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery, of the Military Park, is in the borough limits. Cumberland Township is also the site of the Eisenhower National Historic Site, which preserves the home and farm of Dwight D. Eisenhower.

<text>Harpers Ferry is a historic town in Jefferson County, West Virginia, in the lower Shenandoah Valley. The town&#x27;s population was 269 at the 2020 United States census. Situated at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers, where Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia meet, it is the easternmost town in West Virginia as well as its lowest point above sea level.

Originally named Harper&#x27;s Ferry after an 18th-century ferry owner, the town lost its apostrophe in 1891 in an update by the United States Board on Geographic Names. It gained fame in 1859 when abolitionist John Brown led a raid on the Harpers Ferry Armory in a doomed effort to start a slave rebellion in Virginia and across the South. During the American Civil War, the town became the northernmost point of Confederate-controlled territory, and changed hands several times due to its strategic importance.

An antebellum manufacturing and transportation hub, Harpers Ferry has long since reoriented its economy around tourism after being largely destroyed during the Civil War. Harpers Ferry is home to John Brown&#x27;s Fort, West Virginia&#x27;s most visited tourist site; the headquarters of the Appalachian Trail, whose midpoint is nearby; the former campus of Storer College, a historically black college established during Reconstruction; and one of four national training centers of the National Park Service.

Much of the lower town, which was in ruins by the end of the Civil War and ravaged by subsequent floods, has been rebuilt and preserved by the National Park Service.

==History ==

=== 1700s ===
In 1733, squatter Peter Stephens settled on land near the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers and established a ferry across the Potomac from Virginia (now West Virginia) to Maryland.
Robert Harper, from whom the town takes its name, was born in 1718 in Oxford Township, Pennsylvania, now part of Philadelphia. Since he was a builder, Harper was asked by a group of Quakers in 1747 to build a meeting house in the Shenandoah Valley near the present site of Winchester, Virginia. Traveling through Maryland on his way to the Shenandoah Valley, Harper—who was also a millwright—realized the potential of the latent waterpower from the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers at their confluence. He paid Stephens 30 guineas for his squatting rights to the ferry, since the land actually belonged to Lord Fairfax.

Harper then purchased of land from Lord Fairfax in 1751. In 1761, the Virginia General Assembly granted him the right to establish and maintain a ferry across the Potomac. In 1763, the Virginia General Assembly established the town of &quot;Shenandoah Falls at Mr. Harpers Ferry.&quot; Harper died in October 1782, and is buried in the Harper Cemetery.
On October 25, 1783, Thomas Jefferson visited Harpers Ferry as he was traveling to Philadelphia. Viewing &quot;the passage of the Potomac through the Blue Ridge&quot; from a rock that is now named for him as Jefferson&#x27;s Rock, he called the site &quot;perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in nature&quot; and stated, &quot;This scene is worth a voyage across the Atlantic.&quot; The town was one of his favorite retreats, and tradition holds that much of his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; was written there. Jefferson County, in which Harpers Ferry is located, was named for him on its creation in 1801.

George Washington, as president of the Potomac Company (which was formed to complete river improvements on the Potomac River and its tributaries), traveled to Harpers Ferry during summer 1785 to determine the need for bypass canals. Washington&#x27;s familiarity with the area led him to propose the site in 1794 for a new armory. His brother, Charles Washington, who founded nearby Charles Town, and his great-great-nephew, Colonel Lewis Washington, both moved to the area.

=== 1800s ===

==== The federal armory ====

In 1796, the federal government purchased a parcel of land from the heirs of Robert Harper. Construction began on what would become the United States Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1799. It is referred to locally as both &quot;the armory&quot; and &quot;the arsenal,&quot; but it is the same facility. This was the second of only two such facilities in the United States, the first being in Springfield, Massachusetts. Together they produced most of the small arms for the U.S. Army. The town was transformed into a water-powered industrial center. Between 1801 and 1861, when the armory was destroyed to prevent capture during the American Civil War, it produced more than 600,000 muskets, rifles, and pistols. Inventor Captain John H. Hall pioneered the use of interchangeable parts in firearms manufactured at his rifle works at the armory between 1820 and 1840. His M1819 Hall rifle was the first breech-loading weapon adopted by the U.S. Army.

==== Canals ====

Harpers Ferry&#x27;s first man-made transportation facility was the Potomac Canal. The canal ceased transportation in 1828, but a portion of it in front of the town channeled river water to run machinery for the armory.

The Potomac Canal ran on the Virginia side of the river. On the Maryland side, the later Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad competed for right-of-way on a very narrow patch of land downstream from Harpers Ferry.

==== Arrival of railroads ====
In 1833, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal reached Harpers Ferry from Washington, D.C.; a planned western expansion to Ohio was never completed. A year later, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad began service from Harpers Ferry via Wager Bridge, named for a family that later built the town&#x27;s Wager Hotel. The bridge connected the town across the Potomac with Sandy Hook, Maryland, which for a few years in the 1830s was the railroad&#x27;s western terminus. In 1837, the railroad crossed the Potomac into Harpers Ferry with the opening of the B &amp; O Railroad Potomac River Crossing.

The first railroad junction in the country began service in 1836 when the Winchester and Potomac Railroad opened its line from Harpers Ferry southwest to Charles Town and then to Winchester, Virginia.

==== Virginius Island ====

Virginius Island, which connected the Shenandoah River to the lower part of Harpers Ferry, was created by happenstance in the early 1800s after debris floated down from upstream mills during the construction of the Shenandoah Canal. Cotton, flour mills, and other water-powered companies were developed on Virginius Island, taking advantage of the Shenandoah River&#x27;s water power and good routes to markets. The island came to house all of Harpers Ferry&#x27;s manufacturing, except for the armory, which used the Potomac River for power, and its rifle plant, some distance upstream using the Shenandoah&#x27;s power.

At its antebellum peak, some 180 people lived on Virginius Island, including workers who lived in a boarding house and in row houses. Floods in the 20th century destroyed all structures on the island. Today, visitors can view Virginius Island&#x27;s historic ruins and walk National Park Service trails.

==== John Brown&#x27;s raid ====

On October 16, 1859, the abolitionist John Brown led a group of 22 men (counting himself) in a raid on the armory. Five of the men were black: three free black men, one freed slave, and one fugitive slave. Brown attacked and captured several buildings, hoping to secure the weapons depot and arm the slaves, starting a revolt across the South. Brown also brought 1,000 steel pikes, which were forged in Connecticut by a blacksmith and abolitionist sympathizer, Charles Blair; however, the pikes, a weapon that does not require training, were never used as Brown failed to rally the slaves to revolt. The first shot of the raid mortally wounded Heyward Shepherd, a free black man who was a baggage porter for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

The noise from that shot alerted Dr. John Starry shortly after 1 am. He walked from his nearby home to investigate the shooting and was confronted by Brown&#x27;s men. Starry stated that he was a doctor but could do nothing more for Shepherd, and the men allowed him to leave. Starry then went to the livery and rode to neighboring towns and villages, alerting residents to the raid. John Brown&#x27;s men were quickly pinned down by local citizens and militia, and forced to take refuge in the fire engine house (later called John Brown&#x27;s Fort), at the entrance to the armory.

The Secretary of War asked the Navy Department for a unit of United States Marines from the Washington Navy Yard, the nearest troops. Lieutenant Israel Greene was ordered to take a force of 86 Marines to the town. U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee was found on leave at his home not far away in Arlington, Virginia, and was assigned as commander, along with Lt. J. E. B. Stuart as his aide-de-camp. Lee led the unit in civilian clothes, as none of his uniforms were available. The contingent arrived by train on October 18, and after negotiations failed, they stormed the fire house and captured most of the raiders, killing a few and suffering a single casualty (a Marine, twenty-four-year-old Private Luke Quinn). Lee submitted a report on October 19.

Brown was quickly tried in Charles Town, the county seat of Jefferson County, for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection. Convicted of all charges, with Starry&#x27;s testimony integral to the conviction, he was hanged on December 2. (See &quot;Virginia v. John Brown&quot;.) John Brown&#x27;s words, both from his interview by Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise and his famous last speech, &quot;captured the attention of the nation like no other abolitionist or slave owner before or since.&quot;

==== American Civil War ====

The American Civil War was disastrous for Harpers Ferry, where five battles took place; it changed hands eight times between 1861 and 1865. (Another article says it changed hands twelve times.&lt;ref /name=Atlantic&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) One of the first military actions by secessionists in Virginia was taken on April 18, 1861, when they wrested control of the Federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry from the Union Army, even before the convention which would consider whether or not the state should secede had been called together.

Because of the town&#x27;s strategic location on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and at the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley, both Union and Confederate troops moved through Harpers Ferry frequently. It was said that &quot;Jefferson County is where the North and South met.&quot; It was a natural conduit for Confederate invasions of the North, as in General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Maryland campaign of 1862 and Gettysburg campaign of 1863, and for Union troops heading south in their attempts to thwart Rebel forces in the Valley.

The town was &quot;easy to seize, and hard to hold&quot;, because of its topography: surrounded on three sides by high ground (Bolivar Heights to the west, Loudoun Heights to the south, and Maryland Heights to the east) and the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, anyone who controlled the heights controlled the city.

The war&#x27;s effect on the town was devastating. It was described in March 1862:

In the account of Joseph George Rosengarten, Harpers Ferry and nearby Bolivar, in 1859 &quot;a blooming garden-spot, full of thrift and industry and comfort,&quot; had been reduced to &quot;waste and desolation&quot; by 1862.

The town&#x27;s garrison of federal troops attracted 1,500 contrabands by the summer of 1862. They were returned to slavery, however, when Confederate General Stonewall Jackson took Harpers Ferry in September 1862. Lee needed to control Harpers Ferry because it was on his supply line and could cut off his possible routes of retreat if captured. Therefore. Lee divided his army of approximately 40,000 into four sections, sending three columns under Jackson to surround and capture the town.
 The Battle of Harpers Ferry started with light fighting September 13 as the Confederates tried to capture the Maryland Heights to the northeast, while John Walker moved back over the Potomac to capture Loudoun Heights south of town. After a Confederate artillery bombardment on September 14 and 15, the federal garrison surrendered. With Jackson&#x27;s capture of 12,419 federal troops, the surrender at Harpers Ferry was the largest surrender of U.S. military personnel until the Battle of Bataan in 1942.

Because of the delay in capturing the town and the movement of federal forces to the west, Lee was forced to regroup at the town of Sharpsburg, Maryland. Two days later he commanded troops in the Battle of Antietam, which had the highest number of deaths among troops of any single day in United States military history.

By July 1864, the Union again had control of Harpers Ferry. On July 4, 1864, Union general Franz Sigel withdrew his troops to Maryland Heights, from which he resisted Jubal Early&#x27;s attempt to enter the town and drive out the federal garrison.

==== Post-Civil War ====
Inspired by John Brown&#x27;s raid, both runaway and freed slaves came to Harpers Ferry during and after the American Civil War. This created social tensions between white and black residents of the community and generated a growing need for services for the increasing African-American population. Accordingly, a freedman&#x27;s school was opened on Camp Hill by Freewill Baptist missionaries following the American Civil War.

The town and the armory, with the exception of John Brown&#x27;s Fort, were destroyed during the war. &quot;The larger portion of the houses all lie in ruins and the whole place is not actually worth $10,&quot; wrote a Massachusetts soldier to his mother in 1863. A visitor in 1878 found the town &quot;antiquated, dingy, and rather squalid&quot;; another, in 1879, described it as &quot;shabby and ruined.&quot; Since the Arsenal, Harpers Ferry&#x27;s largest employer before the war, was never rebuilt, the town&#x27;s population never recovered to antebellum levels.
==== Storer College ====
Storer College, devoted to training teachers for freedmen, opened in 1868, much to the displeasure of many residents of Harpers Ferry who petitioned the Legislature to revoke its charter. The War Department gave the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau its remaining assets in Harpers Ferry, principally four sturdy residences for the managers of the Armory, structurally sound but in need of repairs from damage during the war, and the Bureau gave them to Storer College. A one-room school for Blacks was already operating in one of them.

==== African-American tourism ====

As early as 1878, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ran excursion trains to Harpers Ferry from Baltimore and Washington. As described in a newspaper in 1873: &quot;One need only to alight from the train and look a little envious toward the old Engine House or the ruined walls of the old Arsenal in order to have a score of persons offering to become a kind of guide or to point out to your whatever you may desire to know about the great struggle which ended in the &#x27;opening of the prison doors, the breaking of every yoke, the undoing of heavy burdens, and letting the oppressed go free.&quot;

Storer, the only Black college at a location historically important to African-Americans, became a center of the civil rights movement and built the town&#x27;s importance as a destination for Black tourists and excursionists. Douglass spoke there in 1881, as part of an unsuccessful campaign to fund a &quot;John Brown professorship&quot; to be held by an African-American. In 1906, Storer hosted the first U.S. meeting of the Niagara Movement, the predecessor of the NAACP, after its organizational meeting in Fort Erie, Ontario.

In the late 1890s, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad wanted the land where the fort was located to make its line less vulnerable to flooding. Some white townspeople were eager to get rid of the fort. It was dismantled and moved to Chicago for display at the 1893 Columbian Exposition. Abandoned there, it was rescued and moved back to Harpers Ferry by the Baltimore and Ohio without charge, motivated by their expectation that having the fort back in Harpers Ferry would be a tourist attraction and a way to build ridership on the railroad. But most whites were opposed to any commemoration of John Brown, and it was placed on a nearby farm.

Visits by tourists, many of them Black, now began to slowly turn the town into a real tourist center and return it to growth. &quot;Harpers Ferry proved to be one of the most visited places of leisure for nineteenth-century African Americans.&quot; There was a Black-owned hotel, the Hill Top House, built and run by a Storer graduate, Thomas Lovett, but it catered only to white clientele. In the summer Storer rented rooms to Black vacationers until 1896. The fort was the great monument where the end of slavery began. There were so many tourists that they were a nuisance to the farmer on whose lands the fort sat, and so it was moved to Storer in 1909. There it would remain until several years after the college closed in 1955, functioning as the College Museum. Male students practiced their public-speaking skills by giving tours of it.

====Island Park Resort and Amusement Park====

To increase ridership, the B&amp;O in 1879 built Island Park Resort and Amusement Park on Byrne Island in the Potomac, which the railroad bought and built a footbridge to reach it. One had to pay 5¢ ($5 in 2021 value) to cross and enter, after which rides and other activities were free. Access to the park was also a benefit for B&amp;O employees, as it had done in Relay, Maryland. Among the many events held there were a reunion of 4,000 Odd Fellows in 1880 and a &quot;Grand Tri-State Democratic Mass Meeting&quot; 1892.

Thomas Wentworth Higginson, one of the Secret Six who assisted John Brown, chose Harpers Ferry for his honeymoon.

The park was large enough that parades could be held. There were a steam-powered ferris wheel and carousel, a midway, a pavilion for dancing or roller skating, swings, a merry-go-round, and a bandstand. Visitors could also play croquet, tennis, rent boats, fish, or wade in the river. Later there were baseball games. Blacks and whites attended on different days. In 1883, there were an estimated 100,000 visitors. There were six special trains to Harpers Ferry from various points.

The amusement park was kept open despite periodic flooding and repairs until 1909. The B&amp;O kept the site open after that for picnicking.

The bandstand, the only surviving structure, has been moved twice. At the park&#x27;s closing, it was moved to Arsenal Square (the current location of John Brown&#x27;s Fort), then later to the park at Washington and Gilmore Streets. It is referred to as The Bandstand or the Town Gazebo, and many civic, cultural, and recreational activities take place there.

The bridge was destroyed by flooding in 1896, as was a replacement bridge in 1924. The remaining structures on the island were destroyed in a 1942 flood.

=== 20th century ===

==== 2nd Niagara Movement Conference ====
On August 15, 1906, Black author and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois led the first meeting on American soil of the new Niagara Movement. Named after the site of its initial meeting in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada on the Niagara River, the movement met on the campus of Storer College, a primarily Black college that operated until 1955. (After it closed, the campus became part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.) The three-day gathering, which was held to work for civil rights for African Americans, was later described by DuBois as &quot;one of the greatest meetings that American Negroes ever held&quot;. Attendees walked from Storer College to the farm of the Murphy family, the location at the time of John Brown&#x27;s historic &quot;fort,&quot; the armory&#x27;s firehouse. As a result, the fort was soon moved to the Storer campus, where it became the college&#x27;s central icon. After the college closed in 1955, the National Park Service moved it back to as close as possible to its original location.

==== Harpers Ferry National Monument and National Historical Park ====
A 1936 flood left the lower town &quot;shabby and almost uninhabited&quot;, with no bridge across the Shenandoah to Virginia and no highway bridge to Maryland. All remaining structures on Virginius Island were destroyed.

The backbone of the effort to preserve and commemorate Harpers Ferry was Henry T. MacDonald, President of Storer, an amateur historian appointed by West Virginia Governor Okey Patteson as head of the Harpers Ferry National Monument Commission. He was assisted by the Representative from West Virginia&#x27;s Second District, Jennings Randolph, who in 1935 introduced a bill to establish Harpers Ferry National Military Park in &quot;the area where the most important events of [John Brown&#x27;s raid] took place. Although this bill did not pass, the flood of 1936 made the project more feasible by destroying buildings not historically important and thus freeing land. After several other attempts, a bill creating Harpers Ferry National Monument was passed and signed by President Roosevelt in 1944, subject to the proviso that nothing would be done with it until the war ended.

An urgent priority was the new highway, which is today U.S. Route 340. A new bridge connecting Sandy Hook, Maryland with Loudoun County, Virginia opened in October 1947, on which work had begun in 1941 but was interrupted by the war. Another new bridge over the Shenandoah connecting Virginia to Bolivar Heights, West Virginia, opened two years later. Federal highway traffic now bypassed Harpers Ferry entirely.
Land acquisition started in lower Harpers Ferry; the project was supported both by Harpers Ferry mayor Gilbert Perry and Governor Patteson. Twenty-two eviction notices were served in the lower town, and two taverns closed.Property acquisition, not all of which was unproblematic, was completed in 1952 and presented to the United States in January 1953. The National Monument&#x27;s first on-site employee, John T. Willett, began work in 1954.

In 1957, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that the lower town was &quot;a sagging and rotted ghost town.&quot; The idea of making Harpers Ferry into a National Monument was to prevent the further deterioration and to rebuild the tourist industry. The first task of the Park Service was to stabilize the buildings on Shenandoah Street, the main commercial street of lower Harpers Ferry. Roofs were covered, missing windows replaced, walls on the verge of collapse reinforced, and debris removed. Post-1859 buildings were not restored, and most were removed. The NPS built a Visitor Center and a John Brown Museum. Harpers Ferry National Monument became Harpers Ferry National Historical Park on May 29, 1963.

&quot;Recreationists&quot; who wanted a park and did not care about the history were a problem. Local residents did not want to lose recreational opportunities, but swimming and fishing on the Shenandoah shore, formerly common, were prohibited. In order to keep recreationists out of the historic area, and especially Virginius Island, John Brown&#x27;s Fort was moved to Arsenal Square from a now-inconvenient location on the former Storer College campus, parking in the lower town was prohibited, and a shuttle bus service begun. Tensions between the NPS and town residents were ongoing. However, the NPS helped the town achieve Main Street Status from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2001.

The population of Harpers Ferry continued to decline in the 20th century. The majority of the surviving homes in Harpers Ferry are historic, some of which are registered on the National Register of Historic Places.

===21st century===
On July 23, 2015, a fire broke out in downtown Harpers Ferry, destroying eight or nine businesses and two apartments in two historic buildings. The buildings are being rebuilt.

In the early morning of December 21, 2019, multiple cars of a train owned by CSX derailed from the railroad bridge crossing the Potomac River. The derailment damaged a portion of the Goodloe E. Byron Memorial Pedestrian Walkway, which is attached to the railroad bridge and connects the Appalachian Trail between West Virginia and Maryland. Although the accident did not result in any injuries or fatalities, it effectively inhibited all pedestrian access across the Potomac. The bridge reopened in early July 2020.

====Hill Top House project====

The Hill Top House Hotel, which had opened in 1888 to accommodate African Americans as the sole hotel in Harpers Ferry that would accept them as guests, burned in 1911. It was then rebuilt on a larger scale, but that building also burned in 1919. It was rebuilt a second time on a slightly smaller scale but closed in 2008. As of 2021, developers plan to demolish it and build a new 120-room hotel on the site. Controversies about the impact such a proposed venue would have on the town have delayed its development.

==Archaeology==

Under the auspices of the National Park Service, the archaeology of the town of Harpers Ferry as well as that of Virginius Island have been studied in depth. The journal &quot;Historical Archaeology&quot; published its entire volume 28, no. 4, issue of 1994 on Harpers Ferry.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Some properties are currently threatened by development. From most of Harpers Ferry, a fading advertisement for Mennen&#x27;s Borated Talcum Toilet Powder painted on the cliff face of Maryland Heights decades ago is still visible.

The geographical and physical features of Harpers Ferry were the principal reasons for its settlement and eventual industrial development. It is a natural transportation hub and a major river, the Shenandoah, joins the Potomac River at Harpers Ferry. It guarded the entrance to Virginia&#x27;s large Shenandoah Valley, and the Potomac provided easy access to Washington. The valleys of the rivers made it possible to build the never-completed Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, then the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and shortly after that the Winchester and Potomac Railroad. The first railroad junction in the United States was at Harpers Ferry, and telegraph lines passed through the town. The armory, and later other industries, were located in Harpers Ferry because of the abundant water power available from the rivers.

The ferry ended in 1824, when a covered wooden road bridge by the name of Wager&#x27;s Bridge was built. Harpers Ferry was the site of the first and for many years the only railroad bridge across the Potomac River, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s bridge, built in 1836–37. None of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s bridges connecting it with Virginia carried more than horse traffic until after the American Civil War. In 1851, a second bridge was built, across the Shenandoah, one of the earliest Bollman trusses. A newer Bollman truss bridge, which carried both rail and highway traffic, opened in 1870 but was washed away in a flood in 1936.

The town&#x27;s original lower section is on a flood plain created by the two rivers. It is surrounded by higher ground, and since the 20th century has been part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. Most of the remainder, which includes the more elevated populated area, is included in the separate Harpers Ferry Historic District. Two other National Register of Historic Places properties adjoin the town: the B &amp; O Railroad Potomac River Crossing and St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church.
The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) headquarters is in Harpers Ferry. The Appalachian Trail passes directly through town, which some consider the psychological midpoint of the trail despite the exact physical midpoint is being farther north in Pennsylvania. Uniquely, the towns of Harpers Ferry and adjoining Bolivar have partnered with the ATC to be declared a united Appalachian Trail Community.

<text>Duke University is a private research university in Durham, North Carolina, United States. Founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day city of Trinity in 1838, the school moved to Durham in 1892. In 1924, tobacco and electric power industrialist James Buchanan Duke established the Duke Endowment and the institution changed its name to honor his deceased father, Washington Duke.

The campus spans over on three contiguous sub-campuses in Durham, and a marine lab in Beaufort. The West Campus—designed largely by architect Julian Abele—incorporates Gothic architecture with the Duke Chapel at the campus&#x27; center and highest point of elevation, is adjacent to the Medical Center. East Campus, away, home to all first-years, contains Georgian-style architecture.

The university administers two concurrent schools in Asia, Duke–NUS Medical School in Singapore (established in 2005) and Duke Kunshan University in Kunshan, China (established in 2013).

Duke spends more than $1 billion per year on research. , 16 Nobel laureates and 3 Turing Award winners have been affiliated with the university. Duke alumni also include 50 Rhodes Scholars. Duke is the alma mater of one president of the United States (Richard Nixon) and fourteen living billionaires, as of early 2020.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===

Duke first opened in 1838 as Brown&#x27;s Schoolhouse, a private subscription school founded in Randolph County, North Carolina, in the present-day town of Trinity. Organized by the Union Institute Society, a group of Methodists and Quakers, Brown&#x27;s Schoolhouse became the Union Institute Academy in 1841 when North Carolina issued a charter. The academy was renamed Normal College in 1851, and then Trinity College in 1859 because of support from the Methodist Church. In 1892, Trinity College moved to Durham, largely due to the generosity of Julian S. Carr and Washington Duke, powerful and respected Methodists who had grown wealthy through the tobacco and electrical industries. Carr donated land in 1892 for the original Durham campus, which is now known as East Campus. At the same time, Washington Duke gave the school $85,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) for an initial endowment and construction costs—later augmenting his generosity with three separate $100,000 contributions in 1896, 1899, and 1900—with the stipulation that the college &quot;open its doors to women, placing them on an equal footing with men.&quot; Duke would accelerate its mission to become a global university in 1910 with the promotion of William Preston Few as the new president of Trinity College, who sought to establish the university as a southern counterpart to Yale and Harvard.

In 1924, Washington Duke&#x27;s son, James B. Duke, established The Duke Endowment with a $40 million trust fund. Income from the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the Methodist Church, and four colleges (including Trinity College). Few, who remained president of Trinity, insisted that the institution be renamed Duke University to honor the family&#x27;s generosity and to distinguish it from the myriad other colleges and universities carrying the &quot;Trinity&quot; name. At first, James B. Duke thought the name change would come off as self-serving, but eventually, he accepted Few&#x27;s proposal as a memorial to his father. Money from the endowment allowed the university to grow quickly. Duke&#x27;s original campus, East Campus, was rebuilt from 1925 to 1927 with Georgian-style buildings. By 1930, the majority of the Collegiate Gothic-style buildings on the campus one mile (1.6 km) west were completed, and construction on West Campus culminated with the completion of Duke Chapel in 1935. 

In 1878, Trinity (in Randolph County) awarded A.B. degrees to three sisters—Mary, Persis, and Theresa Giles—who had studied both with private tutors and in classes with men. With the relocation of the college in 1892, the board of trustees voted to again allow women to be formally admitted to classes as day students. At the time of Washington Duke&#x27;s donation in 1896, which carried the requirement that women be placed &quot;on an equal footing with men&quot; at the college, four women were enrolled; three of the four were faculty members&#x27; children. In 1903 Washington Duke wrote to the board of trustees withdrawing the provision, noting that it had been the only limitation he had ever put on a donation to the college. A woman&#x27;s residential dormitory was built in 1897 and named the Mary Duke Building, after Washington Duke&#x27;s daughter. By 1904, 54 women were enrolled in the college. In 1930, the Woman&#x27;s College was established as a coordinate to the men&#x27;s undergraduate college, which had been established and named Trinity College in 1924.

According to Duke University Human Rights Center, the school&#x27;s &quot;policy in the 1920s excluded blacks from admissions and also restricted blacks from using certain campus facilities such as the dining halls and dorm housing ... In 1948, a group of divinity school students petitioned the divinity school to desegregate – the first concerted effort to push for the desegregation of Duke&#x27;s admission policy.&quot;

=== Expansion and growth ===
Engineering, which had been taught at Duke since 1903, became a separate school in 1939. The university president&#x27;s official residence, the J. Deryl Hart House, was completed in 1934. In athletics, Duke hosted and competed in the first Rose Bowl ever played outside California in Wallace Wade Stadium in 1942; the second such game was played in Arlington, Texas, in 2021, moved as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During World War II, Duke was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission. In 1963 the Board of Trustees officially desegregated the undergraduate college.

Duke enrolled its first black graduate students in 1961. The school did not admit Black undergraduates until September 1963. The teaching staff remained all-White until 1966.

Increased activism on campus during the 1960s prompted Martin Luther King Jr. to speak at the university in November 1964 on the progress of the Civil Rights Movement. Following Douglas Knight&#x27;s resignation from the office of university president, Terry Sanford, the former governor of North Carolina, was elected president of the university in 1969, propelling The Fuqua School of Business&#x27; opening, the William R. Perkins library completion, and the founding of the Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs (now the Sanford School of Public Policy). The separate Woman&#x27;s College merged back with Trinity as the liberal arts college for both men and women in 1972.

Beginning in the 1970s, Duke administrators began a long-term effort to strengthen Duke&#x27;s reputation both nationally and internationally. Interdisciplinary work was emphasized, as was recruiting minority faculty and students. During this time it also became the birthplace of the first Physician Assistant degree program in the United States. Duke University Hospital was finished in 1980 and the student union building was fully constructed two years later. In 1986 the men&#x27;s soccer team captured Duke&#x27;s first National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship, and the men&#x27;s basketball team followed shortly thereafter with championships in 1991 and 1992, then again in 2001, 2010, and 2015.

Duke Forward, a seven-year fundraising campaign, raised $3.85 billion by August 2017.

=== Recent history ===

In 2014, Duke removed the name of Charles B. Aycock, a white-supremacist governor of North Carolina, from an undergraduate dormitory. It is now known as the East Residence Hall.

On August 19, 2017, following the violent clashes at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was removed from the entrance to Duke University Chapel, after having been vandalized by protesters.

In August 2020, the first undergraduates from Duke Kunshan University arrived for their study abroad on Duke&#x27;s campus. Due to COVID-19, Chinese Duke undergraduate and graduate students unable to travel to the United States were reciprocally hosted at Duke Kunshan campus.

====Controversies====
In 2006, three men&#x27;s lacrosse team members were falsely accused of rape, which garnered significant media attention. On April 11, 2007, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper dropped all charges and declared the three players innocent. Cooper stated that the charged players were victims of a &quot;tragic rush to accuse.&quot; The District Attorney, Mike Nifong, was subsequently disbarred.

In December 2024, Crystal Mangum admitted, during a December 11, 2024 podcast interview, that she &quot;made up a story that wasn&#x27;t true&quot; about the white lacrosse players who attended a party where she was hired to be a stripper. 

In 2019, Duke paid $112.5 million to settle False Claims Act allegations related to scientific research misconduct. A researcher at the school was falsifying or fabricating research data in order to win grants for financial gain. The researcher was arrested in 2013 on charges of embezzling funds from the university. The scheme was exposed by the allegations made through a lawsuit, filed by a whistleblower, who had worked as a Duke employee, and discovered the false data.

In response to the misconduct settlement, Duke established an advisory panel of academics from Caltech, Stanford and Rockefeller University. Based on the recommendations of this panel, Duke Office of Scientific Integrity (DOSI) was established under the leadership of Lawrence Carin, an engineering professor who is one of the world&#x27;s leading experts on machine learning and artificial intelligence The establishment of this office brings Duke&#x27;s research practices in line with those at peer institutions like Johns Hopkins University.

== Campus ==
Duke University currently owns 256 buildings on of land, which includes the Duke Forest. The campus is divided into four main areas: West, East, and Central campuses and the Medical Center, which are all connected via a free bus service. On the Atlantic coast in Beaufort, Duke owns as part of its marine lab. One of the major public attractions on the main campus is the Sarah P. Duke Gardens, established in the 1930s.

Duke students often refer to the West Campus as &quot;the Gothic Wonderland&quot;, a nickname referring to the Collegiate Gothic architecture of West Campus, a style chosen by the Campus&#x27;s founders after campus visits to the University of Chicago, Yale, and Princeton. Much of the campus was designed by Julian Abele, one of the first prominent African-American architects and the chief designer in the offices of architect Horace Trumbauer. The residential quadrangles are of an early and somewhat unadorned design, while the buildings in the academic quadrangles show influences of the more elaborate late French and Italian styles. The freshmen campus, known as East Campus, is composed of buildings in the Georgian architecture style. In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed Duke among the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.

Duke Chapel stands at the center of West Campus on the highest ridge. Constructed from 1930 to 1935 from Duke stone, the chapel seats 1,600 people and, at is one of the tallest buildings in Durham County.

=== West, East, and Central Campuses ===

West Campus, considered the main campus of the university, houses the sophomores and juniors, along with most seniors. Most of the academic and administrative centers are located there. Main West Campus, with Duke Chapel at its center, contains the majority of residential quads to the south, while the main academic quad, library, and Medical Center are to the north. The campus, spanning , includes Science Drive, which is the location of science and engineering buildings. The residential quads on West Campus are Craven Quad, Crowell Quad, Edens Quad, Few Quad, Keohane Quad, Kilgo Quad, and Wannamaker Quad. Most of the campus eateries and sports facilities – including the historic basketball stadium, Cameron Indoor Stadium – are on West Campus.

East Campus, the original location of Duke after it moved to Durham, functions as a first-year campus, housing the university&#x27;s freshmen dormitories as well as the home of several academic departments. Since the 1995–96 academic year, all freshmen—and only freshmen, except for upperclassmen serving as Resident Assistants—have lived on East Campus, an effort to build class unity. The campus encompasses and is from West Campus. Studies, Art History, History, Cultural Anthropology, Literature, Music, Philosophy, and Women&#x27;s Studies are housed on East. Programs such as dance, drama, education, film, and the University Writing Program reside on East. The self-sufficient East Campus contains the freshmen residence halls, a dining hall, coffee shop, post office, Lilly Library, Baldwin Auditorium, a theater, Brodie Gym, tennis courts, several disc golf baskets, and a walking track as well as several academic buildings. The East Campus dorms are Alspaugh, Basset, Bell Tower, Blackwell, Brown, East House (formerly known as Aycock), Epworth, Gilbert-Addoms, Giles, West House (formerly known as Jarvis), Pegram, Randolph, Southgate, Trinity, and Wilson. Separated from downtown by a short walk, the area was the site of the Women&#x27;s College from 1930 to 1972.

Central Campus, consisting of between East and West campuses, housed around 1,000 sophomores, juniors, and seniors, as well as around 200 professional students in double or quadruple apartments. However, the housing of undergraduates on Central Campus ended after the 2018–2019 school year and the respective buildings were demolished. Central Campus is home to the Nasher Museum of Art, the Freeman Center for Jewish Life, the Center for Muslim Life, the Campus Police Department, Office of Disability Management, a Ronald McDonald House, and administrative departments such as Duke Residence Life and Housing Services. Central Campus has several recreation and social facilities such as basketball courts, a sand volleyball court, a turf field, barbecue grills and picnic shelters, a general gathering building called &quot;Devil&#x27;s Den&quot;, a restaurant known as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Bistro&quot;, a convenience store called Uncle Harry&#x27;s, and the Mill Village. The Mill Village consists of a gym and group study rooms.

In December 2016, Duke University purchased an apartment complex, now known as 300 Swift. Swift houses upperclassmen, in addition to the West Campus area, and is located between East and West Campus.

=== Duke University Hospital and Health System ===
Duke University Hospital is a 957-acute care bed academic tertiary care facility located in Durham, North Carolina. Established in 1930, it is the flagship teaching hospital for Duke University Health System, a network of physicians and hospitals serving Durham County and Wake County, North Carolina, and surrounding areas, as well as one of three Level I referral centers for the Research Triangle of North Carolina (the other two are UNC Hospitals in nearby Chapel Hill and WakeMed Raleigh in Raleigh). Duke University Health System combines Duke University School of Medicine, Duke University School of Nursing, Duke Clinic, and the member hospitals into a system of research, clinical care, and education.

In early 2012, Duke Cancer Center opened next to Duke Hospital in Durham. The patient care facility consolidates nearly all of Duke&#x27;s outpatient clinical care services.

=== Other key places ===
Duke Forest, established in 1931, consists of in six divisions, just west of West Campus. The largest private research forest in North Carolina and one of the largest in the nation, Duke Forest demonstrates a variety of forest stand types and silvicultural treatments. Duke Forest is used extensively for research and includes the Aquatic Research Facility, Forest Carbon Transfer and Storage (FACTS-I) research facility, two permanent towers suitable for micrometeorological studies, and other areas designated for animal behavior and ecosystem study. More than of trails are open to the public for hiking, cycling, and horseback riding. Duke Lemur Center, located inside Duke Forest, is the world&#x27;s largest sanctuary for rare and endangered strepsirrhine primates. Founded in 1966, Duke Lemur Center spans and contains nearly 300 animals of 25 different species of lemurs, galagos and lorises.
The Sarah P. Duke Gardens, established in the early 1930s, is situated between West Campus and Central Campus. The gardens occupy , divided into four major sections: the original Terraces and their surroundings; the H.L. Blomquist Garden of Native Plants, devoted to flora of the Southeastern United States; the W.L. Culberson Asiatic Arboretum, housing plants of Eastern Asia, as well as disjunct species found in Eastern Asia and Eastern North America; and the Doris Duke Center Gardens. There are of allées and paths throughout the gardens.

Duke University Allen Building was the site of student protest in the late 1960s. In 1969, six years after the university began to allow African-American students to enroll, dozens of Black students overtook the Allen Building and barricaded themselves inside of it. Their justification included a &quot;white top and a black bottom&quot; power structure, according to the former director of employee relations; the university&#x27;s gradualist and arguably complacent approach to civil rights; high attrition rates for Black students; lack of unionization rights for nonacademic employees; lack of institutional power and self-determination for a Black studies department; &quot;police harassment for Black students&quot;; &quot;racist living conditions&quot;; and &quot;tokenism of Black representation in university power structures&quot; among others. Their underlying demand was &quot;to be taken seriously as human beings and to be treated as any respected human being would be treated.&quot; Provost Marcus E. Hobbes complained that the African-American students &quot;wanted to run the University.&quot; At around 8 a.m., these students entered the Allen Building, asked everyone inside to leave and promptly barricaded themselves inside. The university called the police and, almost before law enforcement entered the building (it was widely understood by students and administration that the police would have likely brutally beat and possibly killed the unarmed Black students), the students exited with their trenchcoats over their faces. Meanwhile, white students and faculty had formed a human shield around the building and a brawl between the police and students ensued, sending a handful of students to the hospital. University president Vincent Price labelled the Takeover as &quot;one of the most pivotal moments in our university&#x27;s history,&quot; claiming that the protestors &quot;changed this place for the better and improved the lives of many who followed.&quot;

Duke University Marine Laboratory, located in the town of Beaufort, North Carolina, is also technically part of Duke&#x27;s campus. The marine lab is situated on Pivers Island on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, across the channel from Beaufort. Duke&#x27;s interest in the area began in the early 1930s and the first buildings were erected in 1938. The resident faculty represent the disciplines of oceanography, marine biology, marine biomedicine, marine biotechnology, and coastal marine policy and management. The Marine Laboratory is a member of the National Association of Marine Laboratories. In May 2014, the newly built Orrin H. Pilkey Marine Research Laboratory was dedicated.

=== Duke stone ===

The distinctive stone used for West Campus and other Duke buildings is said to have seven primary colors and seventeen shades of color. The use of Duke stone has been given partial credit for the university&#x27;s success: &quot;Duke in fact became a great university in part because it looked like one from the start&quot;.

During the planning of the Collegiate Gothic buildings, James B. Duke initially suggested the use of stone from the Princeton quarry, but the plans were later amended to purchase a local quarry in Hillsborough to reduce costs. After a search for a locally sourced stone suitable for construction in a style &quot;that made it look like the university was growing out of the ground, like it had been here forever,&quot; Duke stone and its source quarry in Hillsborough were identified by Duke University Comptroller Frank Clyde Brown and purchased by the university in 1925. Comptroller Brown, who oversaw the planning and construction of the Gothic buildings, wrote that Duke stone &quot;is much warmer and softer in coloring than the Princeton, and it will look very much older and have a much more attractive antique effect.&quot;

Duke stone is a type of Carolina &#x27;slate&#x27; or &#x27;bluestone&#x27;, a metamorphic phyllite rock, with both andesite and dacite mineral composition. Dacitic phyllite is a predominant type of rock found through the Carolina Slate Belt. Duke stone and the Carolina Slate Belt, like the greater Carolina Terrane, are thought to have formed in the Iapetus Ocean off the coast of Gondwana by a chain of volcanic islands known as &#x27;Carolinia&#x27;, starting around 650 million years ago.

The Carolina Slate Belt contains stone of both meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary origin. The geological literature finds the pre-metamorphosis origin of Duke stone to be variously volcanic and sedimentary: it was likely originally formed by sedimentation of volcanic material. A USGS geologist concludes: &quot;The Duke quarry phyllite was derived from argillite, tuff or tuffaceous sandstone, and volcanic breccia. Occurrence of laminated argillites suggests marine deposition. … There is insufficient evidence to determine if the volcanic material was deposited directly by igneous action or if it was re-worked by sedimentary processes. Presence of lava flows and very coarse breccias in Orange County suggest that the volcanic centers were relatively near.&quot; A UNC geologist concurred that &quot;original features of the phyllite have been obscured by deformation and recrystallization, but the rock apparently was derived from argillites and tuffs,&quot; and that &quot;sedimentary reworking of volcanic materials is to be expected.&quot;

After its initial formation, Duke stone underwent several metamorphic events, including the collision of Carolinia with Laurentia. The Carolinia-Laurentia collision started around 375 Mya, which coincides with timing of the Acadian orogeny that formed the Appalachian Mountains. Though Duke stone contains no fossils, other areas of the Carolina Terrane contain fossilized corals and trilobites that were used to establish that this formation is exotic to the main North American (Laurentia) landmass.

The Duke stone quarry now occupies a section of the Hillsboro Division of the Duke Forest. In new construction and repairs on Duke campus, the use of Duke stone is strictly regulated: &quot;All stones shall be laid on their natural beds, with 20 percent of stone being split face and 80 percent seam face, mixed proportionately to show variations of stone coloring&quot;. In recent years, high cost of quarrying the stone, and the irregular knapped ashlar shapes with its associated high stonemasonry costs has led to the university establishing a mix of bricks to imitate the Duke stone colors.

=== Recent construction ===
A number of construction projects in recent years include renovations to Duke Chapel, Wallace Wade Stadium (football) and Cameron Indoor Stadium (basketball).

In early 2014, the Nicholas School of the Environment opened a new home, Environmental Hall, a five-story, glass-and-concrete building that incorporates the highest sustainable features and technologies, and meets or exceeds the criteria for LEED platinum certification. The School of Nursing in April 2014 opened a new addition to the Christine Siegler Pearson Building. In summer 2014, a number of construction projects were completed. The project is part of the final phase of renovations to Duke&#x27;s West Campus libraries that have transformed one of the university&#x27;s oldest and most recognizable buildings into a state-of-the-art research facility. The David M. Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library reopened in August 2015 after about $60 million in renovations to the sections of the building built in 1928 and 1948. The renovations include more space, technology upgrades and new exhibits. In 2013, construction projects included transforming buildings like Gross Hall and Baldwin Auditorium, plus new construction such as the Events Pavilion. About was updated at Gross Hall, including new lighting and windows and a skylight. Baldwin&#x27;s upgrades include a larger stage, more efficient air conditioning for performers and audience and enhanced acoustics that will allow for the space to be &quot;tuned&quot; to each individual performance. The Events Pavilion opened to students in 2013 and serves as temporary dining space while the West Campus Union undergoes major renovations, expected to be completed in the spring of 2016.

From February 2001 to November 2005, Duke spent $835 million on 34 major construction projects as part of a five-year strategic plan, &quot;Building on Excellence&quot;. Completed projects since 2002 include major additions to the business, law, nursing, and divinity schools, a new library, the Nasher Museum of Art, a football training facility, two residential buildings, an engineering complex, a public policy building, an eye institute, two genetic research buildings, a student plaza, the French Family Science Center, and two new medical-research buildings.

=== Singapore and China ===
In April 2005, Duke and the National University of Singapore signed a formal agreement under which the two institutions would partner to establish Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. Duke-NUS is intended to complement the National University of Singapore&#x27;s existing undergraduate medical school, and had its first entering class in 2007. The curriculum is based on that of Duke University School of Medicine. Sixty percent of matriculates are from Singapore and 40% are from over 20 countries. The school is part of the National University of Singapore system, but distinct in that it is overseen by a governing board, including a Duke representative who has veto power over any academic decision made by the board.

In 2013, Duke Kunshan University (abbreviated &quot;DKU&quot;), a partnership between Duke University, Wuhan University, and the city of Kunshan, was established in Kunshan, China. The university runs Duke degree graduate programs and an undergraduate liberal arts college. Undergraduates are awarded degrees from both Duke Kunshan University and Duke University upon graduation and become members of Duke and DKU&#x27;s alumni organizations. DKU conducted research projects on climate change, health-care policy and tuberculosis prevention and control.

== Administration and organization ==

Duke University has 12 schools and institutes, three of which host undergraduate programs: Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, Pratt School of Engineering, and Duke Kunshan University.

The university has &quot;historical, formal, ongoing, and symbolic ties&quot; with the United Methodist Church, but is a nonsectarian and independent institution.

Duke&#x27;s endowment had a market value of $12.1 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2022. The university&#x27;s special academic facilities include an art museum, several language labs, Duke Forest, Duke Herbarium, a lemur center, a phytotron, a free-electron laser, a nuclear magnetic resonance machine, a nuclear lab, and a marine lab. Duke is a leading participant in the National Lambda Rail Network and runs a program for gifted children known as the Talent Identification Program.

== Academics ==
=== Undergraduate admissions ===

Admission to Duke is defined by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as &quot;most selective.&quot; Duke received nearly 50,000 applications for the Class of 2025, with an overall acceptance rate of 6.2%. The yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend) for the Class of 2023 was 54%. The Class of 2024 had a median ACT range of 34–35 and an SAT range of 1500–1570. (Test score ranges account for the 25th–75th percentile of accepted students.)

From 2001 to 2011, Duke has had the sixth highest number of Fulbright, Rhodes, Truman, and Goldwater scholarships in the nation among private universities. The university practices need-blind admissions and meets 100% of admitted students&#x27; demonstrated needs. About 50 percent of all Duke students receive some form of financial aid, which includes need-based aid, athletic aid, and merit aid. The average need-based grant for the 2019–20 academic year was $54,255. In 2020, a study by the Chronicle of Higher Education ranked Duke first on its list of &quot;Colleges That Are the Most Generous to the Financially Neediest Students.&quot;

Roughly 60 merit-based full-tuition scholarships are offered, including the Angier B. Duke Memorial Scholarship awarded for academic excellence, the Benjamin N. Duke Scholarship awarded for community service, and the Robertson Scholars Leadership Program, a joint scholarship and leadership development program granting full student privileges at both Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill. Other scholarships are geared toward students in North Carolina, African-American students, children of alumni, and high-achieving students requiring financial aid.

Duke&#x27;s president, Vincent Price, has described efforts to ban legacy admissions as &quot;troublesome&quot;. A 2022 survey by The Chronicle found about 22% of first-year students were the child or sibling of a Duke alumnus.

=== Graduate profile ===
In 2023, the School of Medicine received more than 7,000 applications and accepted approximately 2.9% of them, while the average GPA and MCAT scores for accepted students in 2023 were 3.92 and 520, respectively. The School of Law accepted approximately 10.5% of its applicants for the Class of 2026, while enrolling students had a median GPA of 3.87 and median LSAT of 170.

=== Undergraduate curriculum ===
Duke offers 46 arts and sciences majors, four engineering majors, 52 minors (including two in engineering) and Program II, which allows students to design their own interdisciplinary major in arts &amp; sciences, and IDEAS, which allows students to design their own engineering major. Twenty-four certificate programs also are available. Students pursue a major and can pursue a combination of a total of up to three, including minors, certificates, and/or a second major. Eighty-five percent of undergraduates enroll in the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences. The balance enroll in Duke&#x27;s Pratt School of Engineering. Undergraduates at Duke Kunshan can choose from 15 interdisciplinary majors approved by Duke and the Chinese Ministry of Education, and more majors are in the process of approval, including a major in behavioral science.

====Trinity College of Arts and Sciences====

At Duke, the undergraduate experience centers around Trinity College, with Engineering students taking approximately half of their Duke common curriculum within Trinity. Engineering students are able to enroll in any classes within the liberal arts college, and Trinity students are able to enroll in any classes within the engineering college. The undergraduate curriculum includes a focus on the humanities. All freshman students take a writing class and a current-issues seminar class. The Graduate School trains roughly 1200 doctoral and masters students in the arts and sciences as well as in divinity, engineering, business, and environmental and earth sciences.

Trinity&#x27;s curriculum operates under the revised version of &quot;Curriculum 2000&quot;. The curriculum aims to help students develop critical faculties and judgment by learning how to access, synthesize, and communicate knowledge effectively. The intent is to assist students in acquiring perspective on current and historical events, conducting research and solving problems, and developing tenacity and a capacity for hard and sustained work. Freshmen can elect to participate in the FOCUS Program, which allows students to engage in an interdisciplinary exploration of a specific topic in a small group setting in their first semesters.

====Pratt School of Engineering====

The curriculum of Duke&#x27;s Pratt School of Engineering, significantly transformed in recent years, immerses students in design, computing, research, and entrepreneurship — but still accommodates educational opportunities, including double majors, in a variety of disciplines from across Duke. The school emphasizes undergraduate research opportunities with faculty. Research and design opportunities arise through a real-world design course for first-year students, internships, independent study and research fellowships, and through design-focused capstone courses. More than 60 percent of Duke Engineering undergraduates have an intensive research experience during their four years, and nearly a fifth publish or present a research paper off-campus. Nearly 54 percent of Duke Engineering undergraduates intern or study abroad. Eighty-five percent have jobs or job offers at the time of graduation. Since July 2018, Duke engineering students have held the Guinness World Record for inventing the world&#x27;s most fuel-efficient vehicle – powered by a fuel cell, it achieved 14,573 miles per gallon equivalent. In 2019, Duke Engineering students earned a second Guinness World Record for the world&#x27;s most efficient all-electric vehicle – 797 miles per kilowatt-hour.

Research expenditures at Duke Engineering exceed $88 million per year. Its faculty is highly ranked in overall research productivity among U.S. engineering schools by Academic Analytics. More than 30 Duke alumni and faculty have been elected to the prestigious National Academy of Engineering since its founding in 1964. The school was created by Duke&#x27;s board of trustees in 1939. It was named in 1999 following a $35 million gift by Edmund T. Pratt Jr., a 1947 graduate and former chief executive of Pfizer. Duke University Pratt School of Engineering celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2014–2015.

Hudson Hall is the oldest engineering building at Duke, constructed in 1948. It was renamed to honor Fitzgerald S. &quot;Jerry&quot; Hudson (E&#x27;46) in 1992.

The Fitzpatrick Center for Interdisciplinary Engineering, Medicine and Applied Sciences (FCIEMAS) opened in August 2004. Research facilities focus on the fields of photonics, bioengineering, communications, and materials science and materials engineering. The aim of the building was to emphasize interdisciplinary activities and encourage cross-departmental interactions. The building houses numerous wet bench laboratories (highlighted by a world-class nanotechnology research wing), offices, teaching spaces, and a café. FCIEMAS is also home to the Master of Engineering Management Program offices. The construction of FCIEMAS took more than three years and cost more than $97 million.

The newest building is the Wilkinson Building which is a 150,000-square-foot building opened for classes in early 2021 with new spaces for education and research related to interdisciplinary themes of improving human health, advancing computing and intelligent systems, and sustainability. It is located at Research Drive and Telcom Drive next to Bostock Library, also houses Duke Engineering&#x27;s entrepreneurship initiatives. The building&#x27;s name recognizes lifetime philanthropic and service contributions of Duke Engineering alumnus Jerry C. Wilkinson and family. 

====Duke Kunshan University====

Duke Kunshan hosts the newest of Duke&#x27;s undergraduate programs, with its curriculum focused heavily on interdisciplinary coursework and majors—described as a &quot;research-inflected liberal arts experience&quot;. The curriculum is rooted in seven &quot;animating principles&quot;, among them Rooted Globalism, Collaborative Problem-Solving, Research and Practice, Lucid Communication, Independence and Creativity, Wise Leadership, and A Purposeful Life. Noah M. Pickus, former Associate Provost and Senior Advisor at Duke and Dean of Undergraduate Curricula Affairs and Faculty Development at Duke Kunshan University, oversaw the development of the university&#x27;s future-focused, internationalized curriculum. The campus also hosts five Master&#x27;s programs administered by Duke&#x27;s graduate schools, including Medical Physics, Global Health, Environmental Policy, Management Studies and Electrical and Computer Engineering.

=== Libraries and museums ===
Duke Libraries includes the Perkins, Bostock, and Rubenstein Libraries on West Campus, the Lilly and Music Libraries on East Campus, the Pearse Memorial Library at Duke Marine Lab, and the separately administered libraries serving the schools of business, divinity, law, medicine, and Duke Kunshan University.

Duke&#x27;s art collections are housed at the Nasher Museum of Art on Central Campus. The museum was designed by Rafael Viñoly and is named for Duke alumnus and art collector Raymond Nasher. The museum opened in 2005 at a cost of over $23 million and contains over 13,000 works of art, including works by William Cordova, Marlene Dumas, Olafur Eliasson, David Hammons, Barkley L. Hendricks, Christian Marclay, Kerry James Marshall, Alma Thomas, Hank Willis Thomas, Bob Thompson, Kara Walker, Andy Warhol, Carrie Mae Weems, Ai Weiwei, Fred Wilson, and Lynette Yiadom Boakye.

In fiscal year 2021, Duke received $608 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health, ranked third in the nation. Duke is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.&quot;

Throughout the school&#x27;s history, Duke researchers have made breakthroughs, including the biomedical engineering department&#x27;s development of the world&#x27;s first real-time, three-dimensional ultrasound diagnostic system and the first engineered blood vessels and stents. In 2015, Paul Modrich shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of mechanism of DNA repairs. In 2012, Robert Lefkowitz along with Brian Kobilka, who is also a former affiliate, shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on cell surface receptors. Duke has pioneered studies involving nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and complex systems in physics.

In May 2006 Duke researchers mapped the final human chromosome, which made world news as it marked the completion of the Human Genome Project. Reports of Duke researchers&#x27; involvement in new AIDS vaccine research surfaced in June 2006. The biology department combines two historically strong programs in botany and zoology, while one of the divinity school&#x27;s leading theologians is Stanley Hauerwas, whom &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;America&#x27;s Best Theologian&quot; in 2001. The graduate program in literature boasts several internationally renowned figures, including Fredric Jameson, Michael Hardt, and Rey Chow, while philosophers Robert Brandon and Lakatos Award-winner Alexander Rosenberg contribute to Duke&#x27;s ranking as the nation&#x27;s best program in philosophy of biology, according to the &quot;Philosophical Gourmet Report&quot;.

== Student life ==
=== Student body ===
Duke&#x27;s student body consists of 6,789 undergraduates and 9,991 graduate and professional students (as of fall 2021). The median family income of Duke students is $186,700, with 56% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 17% from the bottom 60% . &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Duke in 2023 as the least economically diverse top-ranked college in the U.S.

=== Residential life ===
Duke requires its students to live on campus for the first three years of undergraduate life, except for a small percentage of second-semester juniors who are exempted by a lottery system. This requirement is justified by the administration as an effort to help students connect more closely with one another and sustain a sense of belonging within Duke. Thus, 85% of undergraduates live on campus. All freshmen are housed in one of 14 residences on East Campus. These buildings range in occupancy size from 50 (Epworth—the oldest residence hall, built in 1892 as &quot;the Inn&quot;), which has not been used as a student dorm since the 2017–2018 school year, to 250 residents (Trinity). Most of these are in the Georgian style typical of the East Campus architecture. Although the newer residence halls differ in style, they still relate to East&#x27;s Georgian heritage. Learning communities connect the residential component of East Campus with students of similar academic and social interests. Similarly, students in FOCUS, a first-year program that features courses clustered around a specific theme, live together in the same residence hall as other students in their cluster.
Sophomores and juniors reside on West Campus, while the majority of undergraduate seniors choose to live off campus. West Campus contains seven quadrangles—the four along &quot;Main&quot; West were built in the 1930s, while three newer ones have since been added. Central Campus provided housing for over 1,000 students in apartment buildings, until 2019. All housing on West Campus is organized into &quot;houses&quot;—sections of residence halls—to which students can return each year. House residents create their house identities. There are houses of unaffiliated students, as well as wellness houses and living-learning communities that adopt a theme such as the arts or foreign languages. There are also numerous &quot;selective living groups&quot; on campus for students wanting self-selected living arrangements. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any national organization. Many of them also revolve around a particular interest such as entrepreneurship, civic engagement or African-American or Asian culture. Fifteen fraternities and nine sororities also are housed on campus. Most of the non-fraternity selective living groups are coeducational.

=== Greek and social life ===
About 30% of undergraduate men and about 40% of undergraduate women at Duke are members of fraternities and sororities. Most of the 17 Interfraternity Council recognized fraternity chapters live in sections within the residence halls. Eight National Pan-Hellenic Council (historically African-American) fraternities and sororities also hold chapters at Duke. The first historically African-American Greek letter organization at Duke University was the Omega Psi Phi, Omega Zeta chapter, founded on April 12, 1974. In addition, there are seven other fraternities and sororities that are a part of the Inter-Greek Council, the multicultural Greek umbrella organization, in addition to the local group Trident Society. Duke also has Selective Living Groups, or SLGs, on campus for students seeking informal residential communities often built around themes. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any national organizations. Current SLGs include Brownstone, Maxwell, The Cube, LangDorm, Round Table, Mundi, JAM!, and Wayne Manor. Fraternity chapters and SLGs frequently host social events in their residential sections, which are often open to non-members. Social events often feature established traditions, such as Wayne Manor&#x27;s Malt Liquor Thursdays (M.L.T.), which have persisted since 1994.

In the late 1990s, a new keg policy was put into effect that requires all student groups to purchase kegs through Duke Dining Services. According to administrators, the rule change was intended as a way to ensure compliance with alcohol consumption laws as well as to increase on-campus safety. Some students saw the administration&#x27;s increasingly strict policies as an attempt to alter social life at Duke. As a result, off-campus parties at rented houses became more frequent in subsequent years as a way to avoid Duke policies. Many of these houses were situated in the midst of family neighborhoods, prompting residents to complain about excessive noise and other violations. Police have responded by breaking up parties at several houses, handing out citations, and occasionally arresting party-goers. In the mid-to-late 2000s, the administration made a concerted effort to help students re-establish a robust, on-campus social life and has worked with numerous student groups, especially Duke University Union, to feature a wide array of events and activities. In March 2006, the university purchased 15 houses in the Trinity Park area that Duke students had typically rented and subsequently sold them to individual families in an effort to encourage renovations to the properties and to reduce off-campus partying in the midst of residential neighborhoods.

Duke athletics, particularly men&#x27;s basketball, traditionally serves as a significant component of student life. Duke&#x27;s students have been recognized as some of the most creative and original fans in all of collegiate athletics. Students, often referred to as Cameron Crazies, show their support of the men&#x27;s basketball team by &quot;tenting&quot; for home games against key Atlantic Coast Conference opponents, especially rival University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Because tickets to all varsity sports are free to students, they line up for hours before each game, often spending the night on the sidewalk. For a mid-February game against UNC, some of the most eager students might even begin tenting before spring classes begin. The total number of participating tents is capped at 100 (each tent can have up to 12 occupants), though interest is such that it could exceed that number if space permitted. Tenting involves setting up and inhabiting a tent on the grass near Cameron Indoor Stadium, an area known as Krzyzewskiville, or K-Ville for short. There are different categories of tenting based on the length of time and number of people who must be in the tent. At night, K-Ville often turns into the scene of a party or occasional concert. Duke also has a &quot;bench-burning&quot; tradition that began in 1986 which involves bonfires after certain basketball victories.

=== Activities ===
==== Student organizations ====
More than 400 student clubs and organizations operate on Duke&#x27;s campus. These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations. Duke Student Government (DSG) charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups and represents students&#x27; interests when dealing with the administration. Duke University Union (DUU) is the school&#x27;s primary programming organization, serving a center of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life. There are a number of student-run businesses operating on campus, including Campus Enterprises, which offer students real-world business experience. Cultural groups are provided funding directly from the university via the Multicultural Center as well as other institutional funding sources. One of the most popular activities on campus is competing in sports. Duke has 37 sports clubs, and several intramural teams that are officially recognized. Performance groups such as Duke Players; Hoof &#x27;n&#x27; Horn, the country&#x27;s second-oldest student-run musical theater organization; a cappella groups; student bands; and other theater organizations are also prominent on campus. As of the 2016–17 school year, there are seven a cappella groups recognized by Duke University A Cappella Council: Deja Blue, Lady Blue, Out of the Blue, the Pitchforks, Rhythm &amp; Blue, Something Borrowed Something Blue, and Speak of the Devil. Duke University mock trial team won the national championship in 2012. Duke University Student Dining Advisory Committee provides guidance to the administration on issues regarding student dining, life, and restaurant choices.

Cultural groups on campus include the Asian Students Association, ASEAN (Alliance of Southeast Asian Nations), Blue Devils United (the student lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group), Black Student Alliance, Diya (South Asian Association), International Association/International Council, Jewish Life at Duke, KUSA (Korean Undergraduate Student Association), Mi Gente (Latino Student Association), LangDorm, LASO (Latin American Student Organization), Muslim Student Association, Native American Student Coalition, Newman Catholic Student Center, and Students of the Caribbean.

Duke&#x27;s chapter of Students Supporting Israel (SSI), an international pro-Israel movement, was denied recognition by the Duke Student Government (DSG) in November 2021. The incident attracted national media attention, with organizations such as The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and the Zionist Organization of America advocating on behalf of Duke SSI after Duke&#x27;s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine challenged its existence. The Brandeis Center sent a letter to President Price alleging that the derecognition of Duke SSI constituted discrimination against a Jewish student organization. Duke SSI was officially recognized as a student organization in February 2022 after the student government reconsidered the group&#x27;s application.

==== Civic engagement ====
More than 75 percent of Duke students pursue service-learning opportunities in Durham and around the world through DukeEngage and other programs that advance the university&#x27;s mission of &quot;knowledge in service to society.&quot; Launched in 2007, DukeEngage provides full funding for select Duke undergraduates who wish to pursue an immersive summer of service in partnership with a U.S. or international community. As of summer 2013, more than 2,400 Duke students had volunteered through DukeEngage in 75 nations on six continents. Duke students have created more than 30 service organizations in Durham and the surrounding area. Examples include a weeklong camp for children of cancer patients (Camp Kesem) and a group that promotes awareness about sexual health, rape prevention, alcohol and drug use, and eating disorders (Healthy Devils). Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership, started by the Office of Community Affairs in 1996, attempts to address major concerns of local residents and schools by leveraging university resources. Another community project, &quot;Scholarship with a Civic Mission&quot;, is a joint program between the Hart Leadership Program and the Kenan Institute for Ethics. Another program includes Project CHILD, a tutoring program involving 80 first-year volunteers; and an after-school program for at-risk students in Durham that was started with a $2.25 million grant from the Kellogg Foundation in 2002. Two prominent civic engagement pre-orientation programs also exist for incoming freshmen: Project CHANGE and Project BUILD. Project CHANGE is a free weeklong program co-sponsored by the Kenan Institute for Ethics and Duke Women&#x27;s Center with the focus on ethical leadership and social change in the Durham community; students are challenged in a variety of ways and work closely with local non-profits. Project BUILD is a freshman volunteering group that dedicates 3,300 hours of service to a variety of projects such as schools, Habitat for Humanity, food banks, substance rehabilitation centers, homeless shelters. Some courses at Duke incorporate service as part of the curriculum to augment material learned in class such as in psychology or education courses (known as service learning courses).

==== Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) ====
Duke&#x27;s Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps has three wings: Army, Air Force &amp; Space Force, and Navy &amp; Marines. Duke University Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (AROTC) students who receive a scholarship or enter the Army ROTC Advanced Course (Junior and Senior Year) must agree to complete an eight-year period of service with the US Army.

Duke&#x27;s Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) Detachment 585 includes members from Duke University and North Carolina Central University. Established in 1951, Detachment 585 is located at Trent Hall on Duke University campus. This program is designed to provide men and women the opportunity to become military officers while earning a degree. Upon graduation, students who have successfully completed this program will receive a commission in either the US Air Force or US Space Force.

==== Student media ====
&quot;The Chronicle&quot;, Duke&#x27;s independent undergraduate daily newspaper, has been continually published since 1905. Its editors are responsible for selecting the term &quot;Blue Devil&quot;. The newspaper won Best in Show in the tabloid division at the 2005 Associated Collegiate Press National College Media Convention. Cable 13, established in 1976, is Duke&#x27;s student-run television station. It is a popular activity for students interested in film production and media. WXDU, licensed in 1983, is the university&#x27;s nationally recognized, noncommercial FM radio station, operated by student and community volunteers.

&quot;The Chanticleer&quot; is Duke University&#x27;s undergraduate yearbook. It was founded while the institution was still Trinity College in 1911, and was first published in 1912. The yearbook been published continually ever since, apart from 1918 when many students left for military service in World War I. In 1919 the yearbook was titled &quot;The Victory&quot; to mark the war&#x27;s end.

== Alumni ==
Duke&#x27;s active alumni base of more than 145,000 devote themselves to the university through organizations and events such as the annual Reunion Weekend and Homecoming. There are 75 Duke clubs in the U.S. and 38 such international clubs. For the 2008–09 fiscal year, Duke tied for third in alumni giving rate among U.S. colleges and universities according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Based on statistics compiled by PayScale in 2011, Duke alumni rank seventh in mid-career median salary among all U.S. colleges and universities.

=== Duke Alumni Association ===
Duke Alumni Association (DAA) is an alumni association automatically available to all Duke graduates. Benefits include alumni events, a global network of regional DAA alumni chapters, educational and travel opportunities and communications such as The Blue Note, social media and &quot;Duke Magazine&quot;. It provides access to Duke Lemur Center, Nasher Museum of Art, Duke Rec Centers and other campus facilities.

== Athletics ==


Teams for then Trinity College were known originally as the Trinity Eleven, the Blue and White or the Methodists. William H. Lander, as editor-in-chief, and Mike Bradshaw, as managing editor, of the Trinity Chronicle began the academic year 1922–23 referring to the athletic teams as the Blue Devils. The Chronicle staff continued its use and through repetition, Blue Devils eventually caught on.

Duke University Athletic Association chairs 27 sports and more than 650 student-athletes. The Blue Devils are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level, the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Atlantic Coast Conference. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and wrestling; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball.

Duke&#x27;s teams have won 17 NCAA team national championships—the women&#x27;s golf team has won seven (1999, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2014 and 2019), the men&#x27;s basketball team has won five (1991, 1992, 2001, 2010, and 2015), the men&#x27;s lacrosse team has won three (2010, 2013, and 2014), and the men&#x27;s soccer (1986) and women&#x27;s tennis (2009) teams have won one each. Duke consistently ranks among the top in the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) Directors&#x27; Cup, an overall measure of an institution&#x27;s athletic success. For Division I in 2015, Duke finished 20th overall and fifth in the ACC. The Blue Devils have finished within the top 10 six times since the inception of the Cup in 1993–94. Also, Athletic Director Kevin White earned multiple awards in 2014, including the National Football Foundation&#x27;s John L. Toner Award.

On the academic front, nine Duke varsity athletics programs registered a perfect 1,000 score in the NCAA&#x27;s multi-year Academic Progress Report (APR) released in April 2016.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===


Duke&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team is one of the nation&#x27;s most successful basketball programs. The team&#x27;s success was particularly outstanding during its 42 years (1980-2022) under coach Mike Krzyzewski (often simply called &quot;Coach K&quot;). Coach K has also coached the USA men&#x27;s national basketball team since 2006 and led the team to Olympic golds in 2008, 2012, and 2016. His teams also won World Championship gold in 2010 and 2014. Overall, 32 Duke players have been selected in the first round of the NBA draft in the Coach K era. More than 50 Duke players have been selected in the NBA draft.

In 2021, Jon Scheyer was named the team&#x27;s next head coach following Coach K&#x27;s retirement at the end of the 2021-22 season.

=== Football ===
The Blue Devils have won seven ACC Football Championships, have had ten players honored as ACC Player of the Year (the most in the ACC), and have had three Pro Football Hall of Famers come through the program (second in the ACC to only Miami&#x27;s four). The Blue Devils have produced 11 College Football Hall of Famers, which is tied for the second most in the ACC. Duke has also won 18 total conference championships (7 ACC, 9 Southern Conference, and 1 Big Five Conference). That total is tied with Clemson for the highest in the ACC.

The most famous Duke football season came in 1938, when Wallace Wade coached the &quot;Iron Dukes&quot; that shut out all regular season opponents; only three teams in history can claim such a feat. That same year, Duke made their first Rose Bowl appearance, where they lost, 7–3, when USC scored a touchdown in the final minute of the game. Wade&#x27;s Blue Devils lost another Rose Bowl to Oregon State in 1942, this one held at Duke&#x27;s home stadium due to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which resulted in the fear that a large gathering on the West Coast might be in range of Japanese aircraft carriers. The football program proved successful in the 1950s and 1960s, winning six of the first ten ACC football championships from 1953 to 1962 under coach Bill Murray; the Blue Devils would not win the ACC championship again until 1989 under coach Steve Spurrier.

David Cutcliffe was brought in prior to the 2008 season, and amassed more wins in his first season than the previous three years combined. The 2009 team won 5 of 12 games, and was eliminated from bowl contention in the next-to-last game of the season. Mike MacIntyre, the defensive coordinator, was named 2009 Assistant Coach of the Year by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA).

While the football team has struggled at times on the field, the graduation rate of its players is consistently among the highest among Division I FBS schools. Duke&#x27;s high graduation rates have earned it more AFCA Academic Achievement Awards than any other institution.

In 2012, Duke football team made its first bowl game appearance since 1994 with a win over arch-rival North Carolina, a bowl which they would lose to the Cincinnati Bearcats in the by a score of 48–34.

2013 marked the beginning of the Blue Devils&#x27; recent but relative success, having a breakout 10–2, 6–2 (ACC) season while claiming the title of Coastal Division Champions. Duke would go on to play the Florida State Seminoles in the ACC Championship game where they would lose to the national champions 45–7. Duke received an invite to the Chick-fil-a Peach Bowl that same year in which they took on the Texas A&amp;M Aggies led by college football legend Johnny Manziel, losing by a score of 52–48.

For the 2014 season, Duke finished 9–3, 5–3 (ACC) and earned a trip to the Sun Bowl, where the Blue Devils lost to the Pac-12&#x27;s Arizona State 36–31. In 2015, the Detroit Lions drafted Duke offensive guard Laken Tomlinson and the Washington Redskins drafted wide receiver Jamison Crowder. In 2019, Duke quarterback Daniel Jones was drafted sixth overall by the New York Giants.

=== Track and field ===

In 2003, Norm Ogilvie was promoted to Director of Track and Field, and has led athletes to over 60 individual ACC championships, and 81 All-America selections, along with most of the track and field records being broken during his tenure. A new facility, the Morris Williams Track and Field Stadium, opened in 2015.

<text>Richmond ( ) is the capital city of the U.S. commonwealth of Virginia. Incorporated in 1742, Richmond has been an independent city since 1871. The city&#x27;s population in the 2020 United States census was 226,610, up from 204,214 in 2010, making it Virginia&#x27;s fourth-most populous city. The Richmond metropolitan area, with over 1.3 million residents, is the Commonwealth&#x27;s third-most populous.

Richmond is located at the James River&#x27;s fall line, west of Williamsburg, east of Charlottesville, east of Lynchburg and south of Washington, D.C. Surrounded by Henrico and Chesterfield counties, Richmond is at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Interstate 64 and encircled by Interstate 295, Virginia State Route 150 and Virginia State Route 288. Major suburbs include Midlothian to the southwest, Chesterfield to the south, Varina to the southeast, Sandston to the east, Glen Allen to the north and west, Short Pump to the west, and Mechanicsville to the northeast.

Richmond was an important village in the Powhatan Confederacy and was briefly settled by English colonists from Jamestown from 1609 to 1611. Founded in 1737, it replaced Williamsburg as the capital of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia in 1780. During the Revolutionary War period, several notable events occurred in the city, including Patrick Henry&#x27;s &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; speech in 1775 at St. John&#x27;s Church and the passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom written by Thomas Jefferson. During the American Civil War, Richmond was the capital of the Confederate States of America.

The Jackson Ward neighborhood is the city&#x27;s traditional hub of African American commerce and culture, once known as the &quot;Black Wall Street of America&quot; and the &quot;Harlem of the South.&quot; At the beginning of the 20th century, Richmond had one of the world&#x27;s first successful electric streetcar systems.

Law, finance, and government primarily drive Richmond&#x27;s economy. The downtown area is home to federal, state, and local governmental agencies as well as notable legal and banking firms. The greater metropolitan area includes several &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies: Performance Food Group, Altria, CarMax, Dominion Energy, Markel, Owens and Minor, Genworth Financial, and ARKO Corp. The city is one of about a dozen to have both a U.S. Court of Appeals and a Federal Reserve Bank.

==History==

===Colonial era===

After the first permanent English-speaking settlement was established at Jamestown, Virginia, in April 1607, Captain Christopher Newport led explorers northwest up the James River to an inhabited area in the Powhatan Nation.
Richmond was Arrohattoc territory where Arrohateck village was located. However, as time progressed relations between the Arrohattocs and English colonists declined, and by 1609 the tribe was unwilling to trade with the settlers. As the population began to dwindle, the tribe declined and was last mentioned in a 1610 report by the visiting William Strachey. By 1611 the tribe&#x27;s Henrico town was found to be deserted when Sir Thomas Dale went to use the land to found Henricus.

In 1611, the first European settlement in Central Virginia was established at Henricus, where the Falling Creek empties into the James River. In 1619, early Virginia Company settlers established the Falling Creek Ironworks there. Decades of conflicts between the Powhatan and the settlers followed, including the Battle of Bloody Run, fought near Richmond in 1656, after tensions arose from an influx of Manahoacs and Nahyssans from the North. Nonetheless, the James Falls area saw more White settlement in the late 1600s and early 1700s.

In early 1737, planter William Byrd II commissioned Major William Mayo to lay out the original town grid, completed in April. Byrd named the city after the English town of Richmond near (and now part of) London, because the view of the James River&#x27;s bend at the fall line reminded him of his home at Richmond Hill on the River Thames. In 1742, the settlement was incorporated as a town.

===American Revolution===
In 1775, Patrick Henry delivered his famous &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; speech in Richmond&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s Church, greatly influencing Virginia&#x27;s participation in the First Continental Congress and the course of the American Revolution. On April 18, 1780, the state capital was moved from Williamsburg to Richmond, providing a more centralized location for Virginia&#x27;s increasing western population and theoretically isolating the capital from a British attack from the coast. In 1781, Loyalist troops led by Benedict Arnold led a raid on Richmond and burnt it, leading Governor Thomas Jefferson to flee while the Virginia militia, led by Sampson Mathews, unsuccessfully defended the city.

===Early United States===
Richmond recovered quickly from the war, thriving within a year of its burning. In 1786, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, was enacted, separating church and state and advancing the legal principle for freedom of religion in the United States. In 1788, the Virginia State Capitol, designed by Jefferson and Charles-Louis Clérisseau in the Greek Revival style, was completed.

To bypass Richmond&#x27;s rapids on the upper James River and provide a water route across the Appalachian Mountains to the Kanawha River, which flows westward into the Ohio River and converges with the Mississippi River, George Washington helped design the James River and Kanawha Canal. The canal started in Westham and cut east to Richmond, facilitating the transfer of cargo from flat-bottomed James River bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below. The canal boatmen legacy is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag.

Because of the canal and the hydropower the falls generated, Richmond emerged as an important industrial center after the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). It became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities, including iron works and flour mills, in the South and the country.

By 1850, Richmond was connected by the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad to Port Walthall, where ships carrying over 200 tons of cargo could connect to Baltimore or Philadelphia. Passenger liners could reach Norfolk, Virginia, through the Hampton Roads harbor. In the 19th century, Richmond was connected to the North by the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad, later replaced by CSXT.The railroad also was used by some to escape slavery in the mid-19th century. In 1849, Henry &quot;Box&quot; Brown had himself nailed into a small box and shipped from Richmond to abolitionists in Philadelphia through Baltimore&#x27;s President Street Station on the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, often used by the Underground Railroad to assist escaping disguised slaves reach the free state of Pennsylvania.

===American Civil War===

Five days after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, the Virginia legislature voted to secede from the United States and join the newly created Confederate States of America on April 17, 1861. The action became official in May, after the Confederacy promised to move its national capital to Richmond from Montgomery, Alabama.Richmond held local, state and national Confederate government offices, hospitals, a railroad hub, and one of the largest slave markets. It also had the largest Confederate arms factory, the Tredegar Iron Works. The factory produced artillery and other munitions, including heavy ordnance machinery and the 723 tons of armor plating that covered the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, the world&#x27;s first ironclad ship used in war. The Confederate States Congress shared quarters in the Jefferson-designed Virginia State Capitol with the Virginia General Assembly. The Confederacy&#x27;s executive mansion, known as the &quot;White House of the Confederacy,&quot; was two blocks away on Clay Street.

Located about from the national capital in Washington, D.C., Richmond was at the end of a long supply line and difficult to defend. For four years, its defense required the bulk of the Army of Northern Virginia and the Confederacy&#x27;s best troops and commanders. The Union army made Richmond a main target in the campaigns of 1862 and 1864–65. In late June and early July 1862, Union General-in-Chief George B. McClellan threatened but failed to take Richmond in the Seven Days Battles of the Peninsula campaign. Three years later, Richmond became indefensible in March 1865 after nearby Petersburg fell and several remaining rail supply lines to the south and southwest were broken.

On March 25, Confederate General John B. Gordon&#x27;s desperate attack on Fort Stedman, east of Petersburg, failed. On April 1, Union Cavalry General Philip Sheridan, assigned to interdict the Southside Railroad, met brigades commanded by Southern General George Pickett at the Five Forks Junction, defeated them, took thousands of prisoners, and advised Union General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant to order a general advance. When the Union Sixth Corps broke through Confederate lines on the Boydton Plank Road south of Petersburg, Confederate casualties exceeded 5,000, about a tenth of Lee&#x27;s defending army. Lee then informed President Jefferson Davis that he intended to evacuate Richmond.

On April 2, 1865, the Confederate Army began Richmond&#x27;s evacuation. Confederate President Davis and his cabinet, Confederate government archives, and its treasury&#x27;s gold, left the city that night by train. Confederate officials burned documents and troops burned tobacco and other warehouses to deny the Union any spoils. In the early morning of April 3, Confederate troops exploded the city&#x27;s gunpowder magazine, killing several paupers in a temporary Almshouse and a man on 2nd St. The concussion shattered windows all over the city. Later that day, General Godfrey Weitzel, commander of the 25th Corps of the United States Colored Troops, accepted Richmond&#x27;s surrender from the mayor and a group of leading citizens who did not evacuate. Union troops eventually contained the fires, but about 25% of the city&#x27;s buildings were destroyed.

On April 3, President Abraham Lincoln visited Grant at Petersburg and took a launch up the James River to Richmond on April 4. While Davis attempted to organize the Confederate government in Danville, Lincoln met Confederate Assistant Secretary of War John A. Campbell, handing him a note inviting Virginia&#x27;s state legislature to end their rebellion. After Campbell spun the note to Confederate legislators as a possible end to the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered General Weitzel to prevent the state legislature from meeting.

On April 6, Union forces killed, wounded, or captured 8,000 Confederate troops at Sayler&#x27;s Creek, southwest of Petersburg. The Confederate Army continued a general retreat southwestward, and General Lee continued to reject General Grant&#x27;s surrender entreaties until Sheridan&#x27;s infantry and cavalry encircled the shrinking Army of Northern Virginia and cut off its ability to retreat further on April 8. Lee surrendered his remaining approximately 10,000 troops the following morning at Appomattox Court House, meeting Grant at the McLean Home.

Davis was captured on May 10 near Irwinville, Georgia and taken back to Virginia, where he was imprisoned two years at Fort Monroe until freed on bail.

===Postbellum===
A decade after the Civil War, Richmond resumed its position as a major urban center of economic productivity with iron front buildings and massive brick factories. Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s, with railroads becoming the dominant shipping method. Richmond became a major railroad crossroads, showcasing the world&#x27;s first triple railroad crossing. Tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a central economic role, advanced by the world&#x27;s first cigarette-rolling machine that James Albert Bonsack of Roanoke invented between 1880 and 1881.

Lewis Ginter was the founder of Allen &amp; Ginter which was at the time one of the world&#x27;s largest tobacco companies. He would devote his philanthropy to Richmond and was quoted saying &quot;I am for Richmond, first and last.&quot; He built the Jefferson Hotel and suburbs north of Richmond which would go on to be the model for much of the country.

Another important contributor to Richmond&#x27;s resurgence was the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, a trolley system developed by electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague. The system opened its first Richmond line in 1888, using an overhead wire and a trolley pole to connect to the current and electric motors on the car&#x27;s trucks. The success led to electric streetcar lines rapidly spreading to other cities. A post-World War II transition to buses from streetcars began in May 1947 and was completed on November 25, 1949.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the city&#x27;s population had reached 85,050 in , making it the most densely populated city in the Southern United States. In the 1900 Census, Richmond&#x27;s population was 62.1% white and 37.9% black. Freed slaves and their descendants created a thriving African-American business community, and the city&#x27;s historic Jackson Ward became known as the &quot;Wall Street of Black America.&quot; In 1903, African-American businesswoman and financier Maggie L. Walker chartered St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, served as its president, and was the first black female bank president in the United States. Charles Thaddeus Russell was Richmond&#x27;s first black architect, and he designed the bank&#x27;s office. Today, the bank is called the Consolidated Bank and Trust Company and is the country&#x27;s oldest surviving African-American bank. Another prominent African-American from this time was John Mitchell Jr., a newspaper editor, civil rights activist, and politician.

In 1910, the former city of Manchester consolidated with Richmond, and in 1914 the city annexed Barton Heights, Ginter Park, and Highland Park in Henrico County. In May 1914, Richmond became the headquarters of the Fifth District of the Federal Reserve Bank.

Several major performing arts venues were constructed during the 1920s, including what are now the Landmark Theatre, Byrd Theatre, and Carpenter Theatre. The city&#x27;s first radio station, WRVA, began broadcasting in 1925. WTVR-TV (CBS 6), Richmond&#x27;s first television station, was also the first TV station south of Washington, D.C.
Between 1963 and 1965, there was a &quot;downtown boom&quot; that led to the construction of more than 700 buildings. In 1968, Virginia Commonwealth University was created by the merger of the Medical College of Virginia and the Richmond Professional Institute.

On January 1, 1970, Richmond&#x27;s borders expanded south by and its population increased by 47,000 after several years of court cases in which Chesterfield County unsuccessfully fought annexation.

In 1995, a multimillion-dollar flood wall was completed, protecting the city&#x27;s low-lying areas from the oft-rising James River. Consequently, the River District businesses grew rapidly, bolstered by the creation of a Canal Walk along the city&#x27;s former industrial canals. Today the area is home to much of Richmond&#x27;s entertainment, dining, and nightlife activity.

In 1996, racial tensions grew amid controversy about adding the statue of African American Richmond native and tennis star Arthur Ashe to the series of statues of Confederate figures on Monument Avenue. After several months of controversy, Ashe&#x27;s bronze statue was finally completed on July 10, 1996.

=== 21st century ===
By the beginning of the 21st century, the population of the greater Richmond metropolitan area had reached approximately 1,100,000, although the population of the city itself had declined to less than 200,000. On November 2, 2004, former Virginia governor L. Douglas Wilder was elected as the city&#x27;s first directly elected mayor in over 60 years.

Most of the statues honoring Confederate leaders such as the Robert E. Lee monument on Monument Avenue were removed during or after the George Floyd protests in June 2020 following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek M. Chauvin. The city removed the last Confederate statue, honoring Confederate General General A. P. Hill, on December 12, 2022. The only statue remaining on Monument Avenue is of Arthur Ashe, the pioneering Black tennis player. The Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson monument in Jackson Ward was untouched during the protests and remained in place.

==Geography==
Richmond is located at (37.538, −77.462). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (4.3%) is water. The city is in the Piedmont region of Virginia, at the James River&#x27;s highest navigable point. The Piedmont region is characterized by relatively low, rolling hills, and lies between the low, flat Tidewater region and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Significant bodies of water in the region include the James River, the Appomattox River, and the Chickahominy River.The Richmond-Petersburg Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), the 44th largest in the United States, includes the independent cities of Richmond, Colonial Heights, Hopewell, and Petersburg, and the counties of Charles City, Chesterfield, Dinwiddie, Goochland, Hanover, Henrico, New Kent, Powhatan, and Prince George. On July 1, 2009, the Richmond—Petersburg MSA&#x27;s population was 1,258,251.

Richmond is located north of Petersburg, Virginia, southeast of Charlottesville, Virginia, northwest of Norfolk, Virginia, south of Washington, D.C., and northeast of Raleigh, North Carolina.

===Cityscape===

Richmond&#x27;s original street grid, laid out in 1737, included the area between what are now Broad, 17th, and 25th Streets and the James River. Modern Downtown Richmond is slightly farther west, on the slopes of Shockoe Hill. Nearby neighborhoods include Shockoe Bottom, the historically significant and low-lying area between Shockoe Hill and Church Hill, and Monroe Ward, which contains the Jefferson Hotel. Richmond&#x27;s East End includes neighborhoods like the rapidly gentrifying Church Hill, home to St. John&#x27;s Church, poorer areas like Fulton, Union Hill, and Fairmont, and public housing projects like Mosby Court, Whitcomb Court, Fairfield Court, and Creighton Court closer to Interstate 64.

The area between Belvidere Street, Interstate 195, Interstate 95, and the river, which includes Virginia Commonwealth University, is socioeconomically and architecturally diverse. North of Broad Street, the Carver and Newtowne West neighborhoods are demographically similar to neighboring Jackson Ward.Carver has seen some gentrification due to its proximity to VCU. The affluent area between the Boulevard, Main Street, Broad Street, and VCU, known as the Fan, is home to Monument Avenue, an outstanding collection of Victorian architecture, and many students. West of the Boulevard is the Museum District, which contains the Virginia Historical Society and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. South of the Downtown Expressway are Byrd Park, Maymont, Hollywood Cemetery, the predominantly black working-class Randolph neighborhood, and white working-class Oregon Hill. Cary Street between Interstate 195 and the Boulevard is a popular commercial area called Carytown.

Richmond&#x27;s Northside is home to numerous listed historic districts. Neighborhoods such as Chestnut Hill-Plateau and Barton Heights began to be developed at the end of the 19th century when the new streetcar system made it possible for people to live on the city&#x27;s outskirts and commute downtown. Other prominent Northside neighborhoods include Azalea, Barton Heights, Bellevue, Chamberlayne, Ginter Park, Highland Park, and Rosedale.

Farther west is the affluent, suburban West End. Windsor Farms is among its best-known sections. The West End also includes middle- to low-income neighborhoods, such as Laurel, Farmington, and the areas around the Regency Mall. More affluent areas include Glen Allen, Short Pump, and the areas of Tuckahoe away from Regency Mall, all north and northwest of the city. The University of Richmond and the Country Club of Virginia are located on this side of town near the Richmond-Henrico border.

The portion of the city south of the James River is known as the Southside. Southside neighborhoods range from the affluent and middle-class suburban Westover Hills, Forest Hill, Southampton, Stratford Hills, Oxford, Huguenot Hills, Hobby Hill, and Woodland Heights to the impoverished Manchester and Blackwell areas, the Hillside Court housing projects, and the ailing Jefferson Davis Highway commercial corridor. Other Southside neighborhoods include Fawnbrook, Broad Rock, Cherry Gardens, Cullenwood, and Beaufont Hills. Much of Southside developed a suburban character as part of Chesterfield County before being annexed by Richmond, most notably in 1970.

===Climate===

Richmond has a humid subtropical (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) or oceanic (Trewartha: &quot;Doak&quot;) climate, with hot, humid summers and moderately cold winters. The mountains to the west act as a partial barrier to outbreaks of cold, continental air in winter. Arctic air is delayed long enough to be modified and further warmed as it subsides in its approach to Richmond. The open waters of the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean contribute to the humid summers and cool winters. The coldest weather normally occurs from late December to early February, and the January daily mean temperature is , with an average of 6.0 days with highs at or below the freezing mark. Richmond&#x27;s Downtown and areas south and east of downtown are in USDA Hardiness zones 7b. Surrounding suburbs and areas to the north and west of Downtown are in Hardiness Zone 7a. Temperatures seldom fall below , with the most recent subzero reading on January 7, 2018, when the temperature reached . The July daily mean temperature is , and high temperatures reach or exceed approximately 43 days a year; temperatures are not uncommon but do not occur every year. Extremes in temperature have ranged from on January 19, 1940, to on August 6, 1918. The record cold maximum is , set on February 11 and 12, 1899. The record warm minimum is , set on July 12, 2011. The warmest months recorded were July 2020 and August 1900, both averaging 82.9 °F (28.3 °C). The coldest, January 1940, averaged 24.2 °F (-4.3 °C).

Precipitation is rather uniformly distributed throughout the year. Dry periods lasting several weeks sometimes occur, especially in autumn, when long periods of pleasant, mild weather are most common. There is considerable variability in total monthly precipitation amounts from year to year, so no one month can be depended to be normal. Snow has been recorded during seven of the 12 months. Falls of or more within 24 hours occur once a year on average. Annual snowfall is usually moderate, averaging per season. Snow typically remains on the ground for only one or two days, but it remained for 16 days in 2010 (January 30 to February 14). Ice storms (freezing rain or glaze) are not uncommon, but they are seldom severe enough to cause considerable damage.

The James River reaches tidewater at Richmond, where flooding may occur in any month of the year, most frequently in March and least in July. Hurricanes and tropical storms have been responsible for most flooding during the summer and early fall months. Hurricanes passing near Richmond have produced record rainfalls. In 1955, three hurricanes, including Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane, which brought heavy rains five days apart, produced record rainfall in a six-week period. In 2004, the downtown area suffered extensive flood damage after the remnants of Hurricane Gaston dumped up to of rain.

Damaging storms occur mainly from snow and freezing rain in winter, and from hurricanes, tornadoes, and severe thunderstorms in other seasons. Damage can come from wind, flooding, rain, or a combination of the three. Tornadoes are infrequent, but some notable ones have been observed in the Richmond area.

Downtown Richmond averages 84 days of nighttime frost annually. Nighttime frost is more common in areas north and west of Downtown and less common south and east of downtown. From 1981 to 2010, the average first temperature at or below freezing was on October 30 and the average last one on April 10.

===Crime===
Richmond experienced a spike in overall crime, particularly in the murder rate, during the 1980s, 1990s, and the early 2000s, when it was consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous cities in the United States.

Since the late 2000s, various forms of crime have significantly decreased in the city. Its major crime rate, including violent and property crimes, decreased 47 percent between 2004 and 2009 to its lowest level in more than a quarter of a century. In 2008, Richmond had fallen to 49th on a Morgan Quitno Press ranking of the most dangerous cities in the United States, and the city recorded its lowest homicide rate since 1971. By 2012, Richmond was no longer in the top 200.

In recent years, Richmond, like other cities, has had a slight increase in homicides, although violent and other forms of crime remain below the national average.

===Religion===
In 1786, the Virginia General Assembly adopted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which Thomas Jefferson, wrote in 1779. The First Freedom Center now commemorates the site.
Richmond has several historic churches, including several prominent Anglican/Episcopal ones from before the Revolutionary War, Monumental Church, St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church, and St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church. Methodists and Baptists built subsequent early Richmond churches. The first, First Baptist Church of Richmond, was established in 1780. The First Presbyterian Church, organized on June 18, 1812, was the city&#x27;s first Reformed church.

It is one of two Eastern Orthodox churches in Richmond and home to the annual Richmond Greek Festival.

There are seven masjids in the Greater Richmond area, with three more in construction to accommodate the growing Muslim population. The first was Masjid Bilal. In the 1950s, Muslims from the East End organized under Nation of Islam (NOI), meeting in Temple No. 24 on North Avenue. After the 1975 NOI split, Muslims who joined mainstream Islam started meeting at Shabaaz Restaurant on Nine Mile Road. By 1976, the Muslims met in a rented church they unsuccessfully tried to buy. Ultimately, the congregation bought an old grocery store on Chimbarazoo Boulevard, where Masjid Bilal is now located. Initially called &quot;Masjid Muhammad No. 24,&quot; it was given its current name in 1990. The next masjid was the Islamic Center of Virginia, ICVA, established in 1973 as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization. After successful fundraising, ICVA bought land on Buford Road and began constructing the new masjid in the early 1980s. The other five masjids in the Richmond area are Islamic Center of Richmond (ICR) in the West End; Masjid Umm Barakah on 2nd Street, Downtown; Islamic Society of Greater Richmond (ISGR) in the West End end; Masjidullah in the north side; and Masjid Ar-Rahman in the East End.

==Economy==

Richmond&#x27;s strategic location on the James River at the rocky fall line separating Virginia&#x27;s Piedmont and Tidewater regions made it a natural development point for commerce. For centuries and three modes of transportation — boats, with the Great Turning Basin; railroad, with the world&#x27;s only triple crossing of rail lines; and cars, with two intersecting major interstates— the downtown has always been a natural hub.

Law and finance have long been driving forces in the economy. Richmond is home to the Virginia Supreme Court; one of the four courts in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; one of the four divisions of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, one of thirteen such appeals courts.

====Murals====
With the Richmond Mural Project (RMP), sponsored by RVA Mag and Art Whino, and 2013&#x27;s RVA Street Art Festival, the city quickly gained more than 100 murals created by international mural artists, such as Aryz, Roa, Ron English, and Natalia Rak. While the RMP focused on international talent, the RVA Street Art Festival, led by long-time local mural artist Ed Trask, focused mainly on regional artists, although it was responsible for PoseMSK, Jeff Soto, and Mark Jenkins. After some criticism, the RMP included its first local artist, Nils Westergard, who already was on the international circuit, and then another, Jacob Eveland.

===Literary arts===
Richmond has long been a hub for literature and writers. Edgar Allan Poe grew up in the city, and the city&#x27;s oldest stone house is a museum to his life and works. &quot;The Southern Literary Messenger&quot;, which included his writing, is one of many notable publications started in Richmond. Other noteworthy authors who have called Richmond home include Pulitzer-winning Ellen Glasgow, controversial figure James Branch Cabell, Meg Medina, Dean King, David L. Robbins, and MacArthur Fellow Paule Marshall. Tom Wolfe was born in Richmond, as was &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; creator Vince Gilligan. David Baldacci graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University, where the creative writing faculty has included Marshall, Claudia Emerson, Kathleen Graber, T. R. Hummer, Dave Smith, David Wojahn, and Susann Cokal. Notable graduates include Sheri Reynolds, Jon Pineda, Anna Journey and Joshua Poteat.

===Architecture===


Richmond is home to many significant structures, including some designed by notable architects. The city contains diverse styles and has excellent examples of Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Neoclassical, Egyptian Revival, Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Tudor Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Art Deco, Modernist, International, and Postmodern architecture.

Many of Richmond&#x27;s historic properties are documented in books and 1970s-era black and white photographs by John G. Zehmer, an architectural historian and preservationist.

The 1865 Evacuation Fire destroyed about 25% of Richmond&#x27;s early buildings. Fewer remain due to redevelopment and construction occurring since Reconstruction. Nonetheless, Richmond has many historically significant buildings and districts. From the colonial period, there are the Patteson-Schutte House and the Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond, Virginia), both built before 1750.

Architectural classicism is represented in all city districts, particularly Downtown and in the Fan and the Museum District. Several notable classical architects have designed buildings in Richmond. Thomas Jefferson and Charles-Louis Clérisseau designed the Virginia State Capitol in 1785. It is the second-oldest U.S. statehouse in continuous use (Maryland&#x27;s is the oldest), and the first U.S. government building built in the neo-classical style, setting the trend for other state houses and federal buildings, including the White House and The Capitol in Washington, D.C. Robert Mills designed Monumental Church on Broad Street, abutted by the 1845 Egyptian Building, one of the few Egyptian Revival buildings in the U.S.

The firm of John Russell Pope designed Broad Street Station, or Union Station, in the Beaux-Arts style, and it now is home to the Science Museum of Virginia. The firm also designed Branch House on Monument Avenue as a Tudor private residence, which now is the Branch Museum of Architecture and Design. Wilson, Harris, and Richards designed Main Street Station, now used for its intended purpose. The classically trained Beaux-Arts architects, Carrère and Hastings, designed both the Jefferson Hotel and the Commonwealth Club. Ralph Adams Cram, renowned for the Princeton University Chapel and the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, designed many buildings at the University of Richmond, including Jeter and Ryland Halls.

Richmond&#x27;s position as a center of iron production helped to fuel the popularity of its cast-iron architecture. The city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches, balconies, fences, and finials, second only to New Orleans in cast-iron concentration. At the height of production in the 1890s, 25 foundries operated in Richmond, employing nearly 3,500 metal workers. This number is seven times the number of general construction workers employed at the time, illustrating the importance of iron exports to the city. Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods, such as Jackson Ward, Church Hill, and Monroe Ward, are particularly elaborate, often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond. In some cases, casts were made for a single residential or commercial application.

Richmond is home to several notable buildings designed by modernist masters. Minoru Yamasaki designed the Federal Reserve Building, which dominates the downtown skyline. The architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, home to Gordon Bunshaft, designed the Library of Virginia and the General Assembly Offices at the Eighth and Main Building. Philip Johnson designed the WRVA Building. Richard Neutra designed Rice House, a residence on a private James River Island, is Richmond&#x27;s only true International Style home. Famed early modern architect and member of the Harvard Five, Landis Gores, designed the W.G. Harris residence in Richmond. Steven Holl designed the VCU Institute for Contemporary Art, opened in 2018. Other notable architects that have worked in the Richmond area include Rick Mather and I.M. Pei.

Richmond&#x27;s urban residential neighborhoods, largely single use town homes with mixed full retail/dining establishments, are keys to the city&#x27;s character. The Fan, the Museum District, Jackson Ward, Carver, Carytown, Oregon Hill, and Church Hill are districts anchored by large streets, such as Franklin Street, Cary Street, the Boulevard, and Monument Avenue. The city&#x27;s recent population growth mainly has been concentrated in these areas.

===Historic districts===

Richmond&#x27;s City Code provides for the creation of old and historic districts to &quot;recognize and protect the historic, architectural, cultural, and artistic heritage of the City&quot;. Pursuant to that authority, the city has designated 45 districts. Most districts also are listed in the Virginia Landmarks Register (&quot;VLR&quot;) and the National Register of Historic Places (&quot;NRHP&quot;).

Fifteen districts represent broad sections of the city:

The remaining thirty districts are limited to an individual building or group of buildings throughout the city:

===Food===
Richmond has been recognized in recent years as a &quot;foodie city&quot;, particularly for its modern renditions of traditional Southern cuisine. The city also claims the invention of the sailor sandwich, which includes pastrami, knockwurst, Swiss cheese and mustard on rye bread. Richmond is where canned beer was first made commercially available in 1935.

==Sports==
Richmond does not have a major league professional sports team. Since 2013, however, the Washington Commanders of the National Football League have held their summer training camp in the city. The city has several minor league sports franchises, including the Richmond Kickers of USL League One and the Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Class AA Double-A Northeast of Minor League Baseball, a San Francisco Giants affiliate. The Kickers began playing in Richmond in 1993, making them the oldest continually operated professional club in the United States. The club now plays home matches at City Stadium. In 2018, the Richmond Kickers left the USL to be founders in Division 3 Soccer. The Squirrels opened their first season at The Diamond on April 15, 2010. From 1966 through 2008, the city was home to the Richmond Braves, a AAA affiliate of the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball, until the franchise relocated to Georgia.

Richmond is home to the Richmond Black Widows, the city&#x27;s first women&#x27;s football team, founded in 2015 by Sarah Schkeeper. The team is in the Women&#x27;s Football Alliance, which preseason begins in January and regular season in April.

A significant city sports venue is the 6,000-seat Arthur Ashe Athletic Center, a multi-purpose arena named for tennis great and Richmond resident Arthur Ashe. This facility hosts local sporting events, concerts, and other activities. Tennis is popular in Richmond. In 2010, the United States Tennis Association named Richmond the third &quot;Best Tennis Town&quot;, after Charleston, South Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia.

Richmond hosted the 2015 UCI Road World Championships, which had cyclists from 76 countries and an estimated beneficial $158.1 million economic impact on the Greater Richmond Region from event staging and visitor spending. The championship course was the first real-world location to be recreated within the indoor cycle training application, Zwift. The application has subsequently added two other UCI world championships courses, Innsbruck from 2018 and Harrogate from 2019.

The city is home to the University of Richmond football team, who most notably won the 2008 NCAA Division I FCS National Championship. The team plays its home games at Robins Stadium.

Richmond also has seen recent men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s college basketball success in the Atlantic 10 Conference. The Richmond Spiders play at the Robins Center and the VCU Rams play at the Stuart C. Siegel Center.

==Parks and recreation==
The city operates one of the country&#x27;s oldest municipal park systems. In 1851, the City Council voted to acquire , now known as Monroe Park. Monroe Park is adjacent to the Virginia Commonwealth University campus, and is one of over 40 parks totaling more than .

Other city parks include Joseph Bryan Park Azalea Garden, Forest Hill Park (former site of the Forest Hill Amusement Park), and Chimborazo Park (site of the National Battlefield Headquarters).

=== James River ===

Several of the city&#x27;s parks are along the James River, many of which are a part of the James River Parks System, which offers bike trails, hiking and nature trails, and many scenic overlooks. The trails are used for the Xterra East Championship running and mountain biking courses of the off-road triathlon.

Parks exist on two major islands in the James River, Belle Isle and Brown&#x27;s Island. Belle Isle, a former Powhatan fishing village, colonial-era horse race track, and Civil War prison camp, is the larger of the two. It contains many bike trails and a small cliff used for rock climbing instruction. The island still has many remnants of the Civil War prison camp, including an arms storage room and a gun emplacement used to quell prisoner riots. Brown&#x27;s Island is smaller and a popular venue for many spring and summer free outdoor concerts and festivals, such as the weekly Friday Cheers concert series and the James River Beer and Seafood Festival.

Richmond is the only city in the United States with Class IV rapids running through it.

Two other major city parks along the river are Byrd Park and Maymont, located near the Fan District. Byrd Park features a running track, with exercise stops, a public dog park, and a number of small lakes for small boats, as well as two monuments, Buddha house and an amphitheater. The World War I Memorial Carillon, built in 1926, features prominently in the park. Maymont, adjacent to Byrd Park, is a Victorian estate with a museum, formal gardens, native wildlife exhibits, nature center, carriage collection, and children&#x27;s farm.

==Government==















Richmond city government consists of a city council with representatives from nine districts serving in a legislative and oversight capacity, as well as a popularly elected, at-large mayor serving as head of the executive branch. Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term. Beginning with the November 2008 election Council terms was lengthened to four years. The city council elects from among its members one member to serve as Council President and one to serve as Council Vice President. The city council meets at City Hall, located at 900 E. Broad St., 2nd Floor, on the second and fourth Mondays of every month, except August.

In 1977, a federal district court ruled in favor of Curtis Holt Jr. who had claimed the council&#x27;s existing election process — an at large voting system — was racially biased. The verdict required the city to rebuild its council into nine distinct wards. Within the year the city council switched from majority white to majority black, reflecting the city&#x27;s populace. This new city council elected Richmond&#x27;s first black mayor, Henry L. Marsh.

Richmond&#x27;s government changed in 2004 from a council-manager form of government with a mayor elected by and from the council to an at-large, popularly elected mayor. Unlike most major cities, in order to be elected, a mayoral candidate must win a plurality of the vote in five of the city&#x27;s nine council districts. If no one crosses that threshold, a runoff is held between the two top finishers in the first round. This was implemented as a compromise in order to address concerns that better-organized and wealthier white voters could have undue influence. In a landslide election, incumbent mayor Rudy McCollum was defeated by L. Douglas Wilder, who previously served Virginia as the first elected African American governor in the United States since Reconstruction. Levar Stoney served as Mayor from 2016 to 2024. Dr. Danny Avula was sworn is as mayor on December 31, 2024.

The mayor is not a part of the Richmond City Council.

, the Richmond City Council consisted of:
* Andrew S. Benton, 1st District (West End)
* Katherine L. Jordan, 2nd District (North Central), Council Vice President
* Kenya J. Gibson, 3rd District (Northside)
* Sarah M.A. Abubaker, 4th District (Southwest)
* Stephanie A. Lynch, 5th District (Central)
* Ellen F. Robertson, 6th District (Gateway),

==Education==
===Public schools===

The City of Richmond operates 28 elementary schools, nine middle schools, and eight high schools, serving a total student population of 24,000. The city has one Governor&#x27;s School, the Maggie L. Walker Governor&#x27;s School for Government and International Studies. In 2008, it was named one of Newsweek magazine&#x27;s 18 &quot;public elite&quot; high schools, and rated 16 of America&#x27;s best high schools in 2012. Richmond&#x27;s public school district also runs one of Virginia&#x27;s four public charter schools, the Patrick Henry School of Science and Arts, founded in 2010. The 2020 class had an on-time graduation rate of 71.6%, at least 20 percentage points behind most other school divisions, making it the worst in the state.

===Private schools===
As of 2008, there were 36 private schools serving grades one or higher in the City of Richmond. Some of these schools include: Banner Christian School; St. Bridget School; Brook Road Academy; Collegiate School; Grace Christian School; Grove Christian School; Guardian Christian Academy; St. Christopher&#x27;s School; St. Catherine&#x27;s School; Southside Baptist Christian School; Northstar Academy; The Steward School; Trinity Episcopal School; The New Community School; and Veritas School.

The city&#x27;s only Catholic high school is Cristo Rey Richmond High School, after Benedictine College Preparatory and St. Gertrude High School relocated to a combined campus in Goochland.

===Colleges and universities===
The Richmond area has many major institutions of higher education, including Virginia Commonwealth University (public), University of Richmond (private), Virginia Union University (private), South University–Richmond (private, for-profit), Union Theological Seminary &amp; Presbyterian School of Christian Education (private), and the Baptist Theological Seminary in Richmond (BTSR—private). Several community colleges are in the metro area, including J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College and Brightpoint Community College (Chesterfield County). Several technical colleges are in Richmond, including ITT Technical Institute, ECPI College of Technology, and Centura College. The same is true of vocational colleges, including Fortis College and Bryant Stratton College.

Virginia State University is located about south of Richmond, in Ettrick, just outside Petersburg. Randolph-Macon College is located about north of Richmond, in Ashland.

==Media==
The &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch,&quot; owned by Lee Enterprises, Inc., is the local daily newspaper, with a Sunday circulation of 120,000. &quot;Style Weekly,&quot; an online alternative local publication owned by VPM Media Corporation, covers popular culture, arts, and entertainment. RVA Magazine is the city&#x27;s only independent art music and culture publication. Originally a quarterly, it now is a monthly. The &quot;Richmond Free Press&quot; and the &quot;Voice&quot; cover the news from an African-American perspective.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
The Greater Richmond area is served by the Richmond International Airport , located in Sandston, southeast of Richmond and within an hour drive of historic Williamsburg, Virginia. Richmond International is served by ten passenger and four cargo airlines, with over 200 daily flights providing non-stop service to major domestic destinations and connecting flights to worldwide destinations. A record 4.8 million passengers used Richmond International Airport in 2023, breaking the previous record of 4.4 million in 2019.

Richmond is a major hub for intercity bus company Greyhound Lines, which has its terminal at 2910 N Boulevard. Multiple daily runs connect directly with Washington, D.C., New York, Raleigh, and elsewhere. Direct trips to New York take approximately 7.5 hours. Discount carrier Megabus provides curbside service from Main Street Station. Direct service is available to Washington, D.C., Hampton Roads, Charlotte, Raleigh, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. Connections to Megabus-served cities, such as New York, are made from Washington, D.C.

The Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC) provides transit and paratransit bus service in Richmond and Henrico and Chesterfield counties. The GRTC, however, serves only small parts of the suburban counties. The far West End, Innsbrook and Short Pump, and almost all of Chesterfield County have no public transportation, despite dense housing, retail, and office development. According to a 2008 GRTC operations analysis report, a majority of GRTC riders use their services because they do not have available alternatives, such as a private vehicle. In 2014, U.S. Department of Transportation granted Richmond and the surrounding metropolitan area a roughly $25 million grant for the GRTC Pulse bus rapid transit system, which opened in June 2018, running along Broad Street from Willow Lawn to Landing.

The Richmond area has two railroad stations served by Amtrak. Each station receives regular service from north of Richmond, including Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York. The region&#x27;s main station, Staples Mill Road Station, is located just outside the city on a major north–south freight line that receives service to and from all points south, including Raleigh, Durham, Charlotte, Savannah, Newport News, Norfolk and Florida. The historic Main Street Station, renovated in 2004, is the only railway station in the City of Richmond. As of 2010, it only receives trains headed to and from Newport News due to track layout.

Richmond also benefits from an excellent interstate highway position, lying at the junction of east–west Interstate 64 and north–south Interstate 95, two of the most heavily traveled highways in the state. As the state capital, Richmond has great state highway access.

===Utilities===
Dominion Energy supplies the Richmond Metro area&#x27;s electricity. Headquartered in Richmond, it is one of the nation&#x27;s largest producers of energy, serving retail energy customers in nine states. Electricity for the Richmond area is primarily produced at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station, Surry Nuclear Generating Station, and a coal-fired station in Chester, Virginia. These three plants provide a total of 4,453 megawatts of power. Several other natural gas plants provide extra power during peak demands, including facilities in Chester, and Surry, and two in Richmond, Gravel Neck and Darbytown.

Richmond&#x27;s Department of Public Utilities provides the Richmond Metro area&#x27;s natural gas, including portions of Henrico and Chesterfield counties. It also supplies water to the city and surrounding area through wholesale contracts with Henrico, Chesterfield, and Hanover counties. The DPU is one of Virginia&#x27;s largest water producers, providing water to approximately 500,000 people, including 62,000 city customers, through a distribution system of water mains, pumping stations, storage facilities, and a modern plant that can treat up to 132 million gallons daily from the James River.

The wastewater treatment plant is on the James River&#x27;s south bank. It can treat up to 70 million gallons of water per day of sanitary sewage and stormwater before returning it to the river. The wastewater utility also operates and maintains of sanitary sewer and pumping stations, of intercepting sewer lines, and the Shockoe Retention Basin, a 44-million-gallon stormwater reservoir used during heavy rains.

<text>Drogheda ( , ; , meaning &quot;bridge at the ford&quot;) is an industrial and port town in County Louth on the east coast of Ireland, north of Dublin. It is located on the Dublin–Belfast corridor on the east coast of Ireland, mostly in County Louth but with the south fringes of the town in County Meath, north of Dublin city centre. Drogheda had a population of 44,135 inhabitants in 2022, making it the eleventh largest settlement by population in all of Ireland, and the largest town in Ireland, by both population and area. It is the second largest in County Louth with 35,990 and sixth largest in County Meath with 8,145. It is the last bridging point on the River Boyne before it enters the Irish Sea. The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Newgrange is located west of the town.

Drogheda was founded as two separately administered towns in two different territories: Drogheda-in-Meath (i.e. the Lordship and Liberty of Meath, from which a charter was granted in 1194) and Drogheda-in-Oriel (or &#x27;Uriel&#x27;, as County Louth was then known). The division came from the twelfth-century boundary between two Irish kingdoms, colonised by different Norman interests, just as the River Boyne continues to divide the town between the dioceses of Armagh and Meath. In 1412, these two towns were united, and Drogheda became a county corporate, styled as &quot;the County of the Town of Drogheda&quot;. Drogheda continued as a county borough until the establishment of county councils under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, which saw all of Drogheda, including a large area south of the Boyne, become part of an extended County Louth. With the passing of the County of Louth and Borough of Drogheda (Boundaries) Provisional Order 1976, County Louth again grew larger at the expense of County Meath. The boundary was further altered in 1994 by the Local Government (Boundaries) (Town Elections) Regulations 1994. The 2007–2013 Meath County Development Plan recognises the Meath environs of Drogheda as a primary growth centre on a par with Navan.

The town was selected to host Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann for two years in 2018 and 2019.

==History==

===Hinterland===
The town is situated in an area which contains a number of archaeological monuments dating from the Neolithic period onwards, of which the large passage tombs of Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth are probably the best known. The density of archaeological sites of the prehistoric and early Christian periods uncovered in the course of ongoing developments, (including during construction of the Northern Motorway or &#x27;Drogheda Bypass&#x27;), have shown that the hinterland of Drogheda has been a settled landscape for millennia.

===Town beginnings===

Despite local tradition linking Millmount to Amergin Glúingel, in his 1978 study of the history and archaeology of the town, John Bradley stated that &quot;neither the documentary nor the archaeological evidence indicates that there was any settlement at the town prior to the coming of the Normans&quot;. The results of a number of often large-scale excavations carried out within the area of the medieval town appear to confirm this statement.

One of the earliest structures in the town is the motte-and-bailey castle, now known as Millmount Fort, which overlooks the town from a bluff on the south bank of the Boyne and which was probably erected by the Norman Lord of Meath, Hugh de Lacy, sometime before 1186. The wall on the east side of Rosemary Lane, a back-lane which runs from St. Laurence Street towards the Augustinian Church, is the oldest stone structure in Drogheda. It was completed in 1234 as the west wall of the first castle guarding access to the northern crossing point of the Boyne. A later castle, circa 1600, called &quot;Laundy&#x27;s Castle&quot; stood at the junction of West Street and Peter&#x27;s Street. On Meathside, the &quot;Castle of Drogheda&quot; or &quot;The Castle of Comfort&quot; was a tower house castle on the south side of the Bull Ring. It served as a prison, and as a sitting of the Irish parliament in 1494. The earliest known town charter is that granted to Drogheda-in-Meath by Walter de Lacy in 1194. In the 1600s, the name of the town was also spelled &quot;Tredagh&quot; in keeping with the common pronunciation, as documented by Gerard Boate in his work &quot;Irelands&#x27; Natural History&quot;. In &quot;c.&quot; 1655 it was spelled &quot;Droghedagh&quot; on a map by William Farriland.

Drogheda was an important walled town in the English Pale in the medieval period. It frequently hosted meetings of the Irish Parliament at that time. According to R.J. Mitchell in &quot;John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester&quot;, in a spill-over from the War of the Roses the Earl of Desmond and his two youngest sons (still children) were executed there on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1468 on orders of the Earl of Worcester, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. It later came to light (for example in Robert Fabyan&#x27;s &quot;The New Chronicles of England and France&quot;), that Elizabeth Woodville, the queen consort, was implicated in the orders given. The parliament was moved to the town in 1494 and passed Poynings&#x27; Law, the most significant legislation in Irish history, a year later. This effectively subordinated the Irish Parliament&#x27;s legislative powers to the King and his English Council.

===Later events===
The town was besieged twice during the Irish Confederate Wars.

In the second siege of Drogheda, an assault was made on the town from the south, the tall walls breached, and the town was taken by Oliver Cromwell on 11 September 1649, as part of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and it was the site of a massacre of the Royalist defenders. In his own words after the siege of Drogheda, &quot;When they submitted, their officers were knocked on the head, and every tenth man of the soldiers killed and the rest shipped to Barbados.&quot;

The Earldom of Drogheda was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1661.

The Battle of the Boyne, 1690, occurred some west of the town, on the banks of the River Boyne, at Oldbridge. The Tholsel in West Street was completed in 1770.

In 1790, Drogheda Harbour Commissioners were established by the Port of Drogheda Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3. c. 39 (I)). They remained in place until 1997 when a commercial enterprise, the Drogheda Port Company, replaced them.

In 1825, the Drogheda Steam Packet Company was formed in the town, providing shipping services to Liverpool.

In 1837, the population of Drogheda area was 17,365 people, of whom 15,138 lived in the town.

Drogheda&#x27;s coat of arms features St. Laurence&#x27;s Gate with three lions, and a ship emerging from either side of the barbican. The town&#x27;s motto &quot;Deus praesidium, mercatura decus&quot; translates as &quot;God our strength, merchandise our glory&quot;.

The star and crescent emblem in the crest of the coat of arms is mentioned as part of the mayor&#x27;s seal 
by D&#x27;Alton (1844).
In 2010, Irish president Mary McAleese, in a speech delivered during an official visit to Turkey, stated that the star and crescent had been added in the aftermath of the Great Famine as gratitude for food supplies donated by the Ottoman Sultan, which had arrived at Drogheda by ship. Irish press quickly pointed out the story was a myth, with a local historian calling it &#x27;nothing short of sheer nonsense&#x27;. However, later evidence, including a letter displayed at the office of the European Commission, confirms that Turkey came to the aid of the Irish during the Famine.

===20th century===

In 1921, the preserved severed head of Saint Oliver Plunkett, who was executed in London in 1681, was put on display in St. Peter&#x27;s (Catholic) Church, where it remains today. The church is located on West Street, which is the main street in the town.

In 1979, Pope John Paul II visited Drogheda as part of his five-stop tour of Ireland. He arrived less than a month after the IRA assassination of Lord Mountbatten, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s cousin, in Mullaghmore. On 29 September 1979, he arrived in Dublin, where he gave his first mass. He then addressed 300,000 people in Drogheda, where he appealed &quot;on his knees&quot; to paramilitaries to end the violence in Ireland:
&quot;Now I wish to speak to all men and women engaged in violence. I appeal to you, in language of passionate pleading. On my knees I beg you to turn away from the paths of violence and to return to the ways of peace. You may claim to seek justice. I too believe in justice and seek justice. But violence only delays the day of justice. Violence destroys the work of justice. Further violence in Ireland will only drag down to ruin the land you claim to love and the values you claim to cherish.&quot;

===21st century===
Two decades into the 21st century some of the historic core of Drogheda town has suffered urban decline. Some of the buildings have been derelict for some years and are in danger of collapse. There was a 2006 traffic plan for pedestrianisation of West Street. It was rejected at a vote of the elected councillors. They had come under pressure from traders in the area concerned about a potential further decline in customer footfall. But the issue has come up for debate again. When asked, Drogheda residents point out that a combination of expensive car-parking and high commercial rates had a push-pull effect on the town&#x27;s centre. Shops were forced to close and at the same time shoppers brought their business to retail parks such as the Boyne Shopping Centre on Bolton Street. A substantial root-and-branch approach to renewal of the locality was proposed in &quot;Westgate Vision: A Townscape Recovery Guide&quot;. The Westgate area of Drogheda is to be subject to a 10-year regeneration by Louth County Council.

<text>The fat acceptance movement (also known by various other names, such as fat pride, fat empowerment, fat liberation, and fat activism) is a social movement which seeks to eliminate the social stigma of obesity. Areas of contention include the aesthetic, legal, and medical approaches to fat people.

The modern fat acceptance movement began in the late 1960s. Besides its political role, the fat acceptance movement also constitutes a subculture which acts as a social group for its members. The fat acceptance movement has been criticized for not adding value to the debate over human health, with some critics accusing the movement of &quot;promoting a lifestyle that can have dire health consequences&quot;.

==History==
The history of the fat acceptance movement can be dated back to 1967 when 500 people met in New York&#x27;s Central Park to protest against anti-fat bias. Sociologist Charlotte Cooper has argued that the history of the fat activist movement is best understood in waves, similar to the feminist movement, with which she believes it is closely tied. Cooper believes that fat activists have suffered similar waves of activism followed by burnout, with activists in the following wave often unaware of the history of the movement, resulting in a lack of continuity.

Other scholars, such as Amy Erdman Farrell, have argued that the history of fat activism that traditionally gets told is a dominantly white history. The intersectional work of fat activists of color frequently gets overlooked within this traditional history.

===First wave===
First wave activities consisted of isolated activists drawing attention to the dominant model of obesity and challenging it as only one of several possible models. This kind of political climate was the background of the fat acceptance movement, which originated in the late 1960s. Like other social movements from this period, the fat acceptance movement, initially known as &quot;Fat Pride&quot;, &quot;Fat Power&quot;, or &quot;Fat Liberation&quot;, often consisted of people acting in an impromptu fashion. A &quot;fat-in&quot; was staged in New York&#x27;s Central Park in 1967. Called by radio personality Steve Post, the &quot;Fat-in&quot; consisted of a group of 500 people eating, carrying signs and photographs of Twiggy (a model famous for her thin figure), and burning diet books.

In 1967, Lew Louderback wrote an article in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; called &quot;More People Should be FAT&quot; in response to discrimination against his wife. The article led to a meeting between Louderback and William Fabrey, who went on to found the first organization for fat people and their supporters, originally named the &#x27;National Association to Aid Fat Americans&#x27; and currently called the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA). NAAFA was founded in America, in 1969, by Bill Fabrey in response to discrimination against his wife. He primarily intended it to campaign for fat rights, however, a reporter attending the 2001 NAAFA conference notes that few attendees were active in fat rights politics and that most women came to shop for fashion, wear it on the conference catwalk or to meet a potential partner. Since 1991, Fabrey has worked as a director with the Council on Size and Weight Discrimination, specializing in the history of the size acceptance movement.

In 1972, the feminist group The Fat Underground was formed. It began as a radical chapter of NAAFA and spun off to become independent when NAAFA expressed concerns about its promotion of a stronger activist philosophy. The FU were inspired by and, in some cases, members of the Radical Therapy Collective, a feminist group that believed that many psychological problems were caused by oppressive social institutions and practices. Founded by Sara Fishman (then Sara Aldebaran) and Judy Freespirit, the Fat Underground took issue with what they saw as a growing bias against obesity in the scientific community. They coined the saying, &quot;a diet is a cure that doesn&#x27;t work, for a disease that doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;. Shortly afterward, Fishman moved to Connecticut, where, along with Karen Scott-Jones, she founded the New Haven Fat Liberation Front, an organization similar to the Fat Underground in its scope and focus. In 1983, the two groups collaborated to publish a seminal book in the field of fat activism, &quot;Shadow on a Tightrope&quot;, which collected several fat activist position papers initially distributed by the Fat Underground, as well as poems and essays from other writers.

In 1979, Carole Shaw coined the term Big Beautiful Woman (BBW) and launched a fashion and lifestyle magazine of the same name aimed at plus-sized women. The original print magazine ceased publication in May 2003, but continued in various online formats. The term &quot;BBW&quot; has become widely used to refer to any fat woman (sometimes in a derogatory way). Several other periodicals focusing on fashion and lifestyle for &quot;fuller-figured&quot; women were published in print from the early 1980s to the mid 2010s. From 1984 to 2000, &quot;Radiance: The Magazine for Large Women&quot; was published in print to &quot;support women &#x27;all sizes of large in living proud, full, active lives, at whatever weight, with self-love and self-respect.&quot;

In the UK, the London Fat Women&#x27;s Group was formed, the first British fat activist group, and was active between approximately 1985 and 1989. Other first wave activities included the productions of zines such as &quot;Figure 8&quot; and &quot;Fat!So?&quot; by Marilyn Wann. The latter went on to become a book of the same name.

===Second wave===
In the second wave, the fat acceptance movement became more widespread in the US and started to spread to other countries. Ideas from the movement began to appear in the mainstream. Publishers became more willing to publish fat acceptance themed literature. The 1980s witnessed an increase in activist organizations, publications, and conferences.

In 1989, a group of people including actress Anne Zamberlan formed the first French organization for fat acceptance, &quot;Allegro fortissimo&quot;. Organizations began holding conferences and conventions, including NAAFA. By the 1990s, input from the fat acceptance movement began to be incorporated into research papers by some members of the medical professions such as new anti-dieting programs and models of obesity management.

===Third wave===
The fat acceptance movement has seen a diversification of projects during the third wave. Activities have addressed issues of both fat and race, class, sexuality, and other issues. Size discrimination has been increasingly addressed in the arts, as well.

==Campaigning themes==
The fat acceptance movement argues that fat people are targets of hatred and discrimination. In particular, advocates suggest obese women are subjected to more social pressure than obese men. The movement argues that these attitudes comprise a fat phobic entrenched societal norm, evident in many social institutions, including the mass media, where fat people are often ridiculed, or held up as objects of pity. Discrimination includes a lack of equal access to transportation and employment. Members of the fat acceptance movement perceive negative societal attitudes as persistent, and as being based on the presumption that fatness reflects negatively on a person&#x27;s character. Fat activists push for change in societal, personal, and medical attitudes toward fat people. Fat acceptance organizations engage in public education about what they describe as myths concerning fat people.

=== Discrimination ===
Fat people experience many different kinds of discrimination because of their weight. This discrimination appears in healthcare, employment, education, personal relationships, and the media. Fat individuals also argue clothing stores discriminate against them. For example, some women have complained that &quot;one size fits all&quot; stores, which offer a single size for each item, do not cater to those above a certain weight. Public transport has also been subject to criticism due to lack of inclusivity to fat people as seats and walkways are often too small to accommodate them.

On the subject of horseback riding, there has been disagreement between fat acceptance activists and animal rights activists.

===Health===
Fat activists argue that anti-fat stigma and aggressive diet promotion have led to an increase in psychological and physiological problems among fat people. For instance, individuals who experience weight discrimination have reported facing more psychological distress, more loneliness, and lower well-being. Along with this, weight discrimination can heighten risk for obesity, chronic inflammation, and disease burden. People can indulge in health-risk behaviors, such as avoiding physical activity. Experiencing and internalizing weight stigma are identified as critical risk factors leading to eating pathology. Concerns are also raised that modern culture&#x27;s focus on weight loss does not have a foundation in scientific research, but instead is an example of using science as a means to control deviance, as a part of society&#x27;s attempt to deal with something that it finds disturbing. Diet critics cite the high failure rate of permanent weight-loss attempts, and the dangers of &quot;yo-yo&quot; weight fluctuations and weight-loss surgeries. Fat activists argue that the health issues of obesity and being overweight have been exaggerated or misrepresented, and that health issues are used as a cover for cultural and aesthetic prejudices against fat.

Proponents of fat acceptance maintain that people of all shapes and sizes can strive for fitness and physical health. They believe that healthy behaviors can be independent of body weight. Informed by this approach, psychologists who were unhappy with the treatment of fat people in the medical world initiated the Health at Every Size movement. It has five basic tenets: (1) enhancing health, (2) size and self-acceptance (3) the pleasure of eating well, (4) the joy of movement, and (5) an end to weight bias.

Some proponents also claim that people with obesity can be metabolically healthy. Some medical studies have challenged that &quot;healthy obesity&quot; concept, although the definitions of metabolically healthy obesity are not standardized across studies.

===Gender===

====Fat women====

The issues faced by fat women in society have been a central theme of the fat acceptance movement since its inception. Although the first organization, National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, and the first book, &quot;Fat Power&quot; (1970), were both created by men, in each case they were responses to weight discrimination experienced by their wives. Women soon started campaigning on their behalf with the first feminist group, &#x27;The Fat Underground&#x27;, being formed in 1973. Issues addressed regarding women have included body image, and in particular the thin ideal and its effect on women. Critics say NAAFA, which opposes dieting and weight-loss surgery, is an apologist for an unhealthy lifestyle. But NAAFA says it does no such thing, that some people are just bigger and no less deserving of the same rights as everyone else.

====Fat men====
The fat acceptance movement has primarily focused on a feminist model of patriarchal oppression of fat women, most clearly represented by the encouragement of women to diet. However, Sander L. Gilman argues that, until the 20th century, dieting has historically been a man&#x27;s activity. He continues, &quot;Obesity eats away at the idealized image of the masculine just as surely as it does the idealized image of the feminine.&quot; William Banting was the author of an 1863 booklet called &quot;Letter On Corpulence&quot;, which modern diets have used as a model. Men respond to being overweight differently, (i.e., having a Body Mass Index of 25 or more), being half as likely as women to diet, a quarter as likely to undergo weightloss surgery and only a fifth as likely to report feeling shame about their weight. Irmgard Tischner identifies this behavior as rooted in notions of masculinity that require disregard for healthcare: &quot;Men do not have to care about their size or health, as they have women to care about those things for them&quot;.

Some gay men have moved beyond disregard for size to fat acceptance and fat activism with movements like chub culture, which started as Girth &amp; Mirth clubs in San Francisco in 1976 and the bear culture which fetishizes big, hairy men. Ganapati Durgadas argues that fat bisexual and gay men &quot;are reminders of the feminine stigma with which heterosexism still tars queer men&quot;. In a comparison of queer fat positive zines, the lesbian-produced &quot;Fat Girl&quot; was found to have political debate content absent from gay male orientated zines such as &quot;Bulk Male&quot; and &quot;Big Ad&quot;. Joel Barraquiel Tan comments: &quot;If fat is a feminist issue, then fat or heft is a fetishized one for gay men. Gay men tend to sexualize difference, where lesbians have historically politicized it.&quot;

A fat heterosexual man is known as a &quot;Big Handsome Man&quot; (BHM), in counterpart to a Big Beautiful Woman. Like some fat and gay men, BHMs have sexualized their difference and receive validation of this identity from BBWs or straight women known as &quot;Female Fat Admirers&quot;.

===Legislation===
In the 1970s, fat people in the United States began seeking legal redress for discrimination based on weight, primarily in the workplace but also for being denied access to, or treated differently in regards to, services or entertainment. The results of these cases have varied considerably, although in some instances the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has been successfully used to argue cases of discrimination against fat people. Roth and Solovay argue that, as with transgender people, a major cause for the variation in success is the extent to which litigants are apologetic for their size (with more apologetic plaintiffs finding more success):

What is the difference between a million-dollar weight case award and a losing case? Like the difference between many winning and losing transgender cases, it&#x27;s all about the attitude. Does the claimant&#x27;s attitude and experience about weight/gender reinforce or challenge dominant stereotypes? Winning cases generally adopt a legal posture that reinforces social prejudices. Cases that challenge societal prejudices generally lose.
The Americans with Disabilities Act continues to be used as there is no USA federal law against weight discrimination; however, the state of Michigan passed a law against weight discrimination in 1976. The cities of Washington, D.C., San Francisco (2000), Santa Cruz, Binghamton, Urbana (1990s), New York (2023), and Madison (1970s) have also passed laws prohibiting weight discrimination. In the cities that have a weight discrimination law, it is rare for more than one case a year to be brought, except for San Francisco which may have as many as six. Opinions amongst city enforcement workers vary as to why the prosecution numbers are so low, although they all suggested that both overweight people and employers were unaware of the protective legislation and it was also noted that the cities with anti-weight discrimination laws tended to be liberal college towns.

Not all legal changes have protected the rights of fat people. Despite recommendations from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to the contrary, in 2009 the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decided that fat people will only qualify as disabled if it can be proved that their weight is caused by an underlying condition, supporting the concept that being obese is not inherently a disability. The Supreme Court of Texas came to a similar conclusion in 2023. But in 2018, the Washington Supreme Court provided weight-related disability bias protection without evidence of a related medical condition. Other countries besides the United States have considered legislation to protect the rights of fat people. In the UK an All-Party Parliamentary Group published a report in 2012 called &quot;Reflections on Body Image&quot; that found that one in five British people had been victimized because of their weight. The report recommended that Members of Parliament investigated putting &quot;appearance-based discrimination&quot; under the same legal basis as sexual or racial discrimination via the Equality Act 2010 which makes it illegal to harass, victimize or discriminate against anyone in the workplace based on several named categories, including size or weight. The Equality Act came into force on 1 October 2010, it brings together over 116 separate pieces of legislation into one single Act. The Act provides a legal framework to protect the rights of individuals and advance equality of opportunity for all.

===Fat studies===
There has also been an emerging body of academic studies called Fat Studies. Marilyn Wann argues that fat studies moved beyond being an individual endeavor to being a field of study with the 2004 conference &quot;Fat Attitudes: An Examination of an American Subculture and the Representation of the Female Body&quot;. The American Popular Culture Association regularly includes panels on the subject. In many colleges, student groups with a fat activist agenda have emerged, including Hampshire, Smith, and Antioch. Fat studies are now available as an interdisciplinary course of study at some colleges, taking a similar approach to other identity studies such as women&#x27;s studies, queer studies, and African American studies. As of 2011, there were two Australian courses and ten American courses that were primarily focused on fat studies or Health at Every Size, and numerous other courses that had some fat acceptance content. Taylor &amp; Francis publish an online &quot;Fat Studies&quot; journal. The first national Fat Studies seminar was held at York in May 2008, leading to the 2009 publication &quot;Fat Studies in the UK&quot;, edited by Corinna Tomrley and Ann Kalosky Naylor.

==Division within the movement==
The fat acceptance movement has been divided in its response to proposed legislation defining morbidly obese people as disabled. NAAFA board member Peggy Howell says: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of conflict in the size acceptance community over this. I don&#x27;t consider myself disabled, and some people don&#x27;t like &#x27;fat&#x27; being considered a disability.&quot; An example of the positive perspective of obesity being classified as a disability in wider society is noted by a person interviewed by Amy Erdman in her book Fat Shame: &quot;[Deborah Harper] makes a point to tell me how impressed she is with the way many do make quiet and polite accommodations for her.&quot; Women are particularly active within the fat acceptance movement and membership of fat acceptance organizations is dominated by middle-class women in the heaviest 1–2% of the population. Members have criticized the lack of representation in the movement from men, people of color, and people of lower socioeconomic status.

==Criticism==
The fat acceptance movement has been criticized from several perspectives. The primary criticism is that fat acceptance ignores studies that have shown health issues to be linked to obesity and hence encourages an unhealthy lifestyle. In 2008, Lily-Rygh Glen, a writer, musician, and former fat acceptance activist, interviewed multiple women who claimed to be rejected by their peers within the movement and labeled &quot;traitors&quot; when they changed their diets.

===Medical criticism===
Human health is a multi-faceted issue; more and more rigorous scientific research reveals the relationship between weight and health is complex. The fat acceptance movement has been criticized for not adding value to the debate over human health, with some critics accusing the movement of &quot;promoting a lifestyle that can have dire health consequences&quot;. There is a considerable amount of evidence that being obese is connected to increased all-cause mortality and diseases, and significant weight loss (&gt;10%), using a variety of diets, improves or reverses metabolic syndromes and other health outcomes associated with obesity. Barry Franklin, director of a cardio rehab facility, stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to take on any specific organization but... A social movement that would suggest health at any size in many respects can be misleading.&quot; Franklin also agrees that fit people who are obese have cardiovascular mortality rates that are lower than thin, unfit people, and proponents of the fat acceptance movement argue that people of all shapes and sizes can choose behaviors that support their fitness and physical health.

<doc id="53285" wikidata="Q192839" url="?curid=53285" title="Sébastien Le Prestre, Marquis of Vauban">
<text>Sébastien Le Prestre, Marquis of Vauban (May 163330 March 1707), commonly referred to as Vauban (), was a French Royal Army officer and engineer who served under Louis XIV. He is generally considered the greatest military engineer of his time, and one of the most important in European military history.

His principles for fortifications were commonly used for nearly 100 years after his death, while aspects of his offensive tactics were employed into the twentieth century. Viewing civilian infrastructure as closely connected to military effectiveness, Vauban upgraded many of France&#x27;s major ports, as well as new projects like the &quot;Canal de la Bruche&quot;, which is still in use today. He founded the , whose curriculum was based on his publications concerning engineering design, strategy and training.

His economic tract, , used statistics in support of his arguments, making it a precursor of modern economics. Later destroyed by royal decree, it contained radical proposals for a more even distribution of the tax burden. His application of rational and scientific methods to problem-solving, whether engineering or social, anticipated an approach common in the Age of Enlightenment.

Perhaps the most enduring aspect of Vauban&#x27;s legacy was his view of France as a geographical entity. His advocacy of giving up territory for a more coherent and defensible border was unusual for the period; the boundaries of the French state he proposed in the north and east have changed very little since.

==Early life and education==
Sébastien le Prestre de Vauban was born in May 1633, in Saint-Léger-de-Foucheret, renamed Saint-Léger-Vauban by Napoleon III in 1867, in the Yonne, part of what is now the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region. His parents, Urbain Le Prestre ( 1602–1652) and Edmée de Cormignolle (died c. 1651), were members of the minor nobility from Vauban in Bazoches. 

In 1570, his grandfather, Jacques Le Prestre, acquired Château de Bazoches when he married Françoise de la Perrière, an illegitimate daughter of the Comte de Bazoches, who died intestate. The 30-year legal battle by the Le Prestre family to retain the property proved financially ruinous, forcing Urbain to become a forestry worker. He also designed gardens for the local gentry, including the owners of the Château de Ruère, where Vauban spent his early years.

Sébastien&#x27;s only sister, Charlotte (1638–1645?), died young, but he had many relatives; his cousin, Paul le Prestre (c. 1630 – 1703), was an army officer who supervised construction of Les Invalides. Three of Paul&#x27;s sons served in the army, two of them were killed in action in 1676 and 1677. The third, Antoine (1654–1731), became Vauban&#x27;s assistant and later a lieutenant-general; in 1710, he was appointed Governor of Béthune for life, while he inherited Vauban&#x27;s titles and the bulk of his lands.

Vauban&#x27;s earliest years are poorly documented but it is known he learned to ride from a very young age and his family was affected by the domestic conflict and foreign wars, including the Huguenot rebellions of the 1620s, the 1635–1659 Franco-Spanish War, and 1648 to 1653 Fronde; his Catholic grandfather married a Protestant from La Rochelle, and served Huguenot leader Admiral Coligny, while two of his uncles died in the war with Spain.

==Career==
In 1643, at the age of ten, Vauban was sent to the Carmelite college in Semur-en-Auxois, where he was taught the basics of mathematics, science and geometry. His father&#x27;s work was also relevant; the design of neo-classical gardens and fortifications were closely linked, since they both concerned managing space. It was common to combine these skills; John Armstrong (1674–1742), Marlborough&#x27;s chief military engineer, laid out the lake and gardens at Blenheim Palace.

In 1650, Vauban joined the household of his local magnate, the Prince de Condé, where he met de Montal; a close neighbour from Nièvre, the two were colleagues for many years, and often worked together. During the 1650–1653 Fronde des nobles, Condé was arrested by the Regency Council, led by Louis XIV&#x27;s mother Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin. After being released in 1652, he and his supporters, among them Vauban and de Montal, went into exile in the Spanish Netherlands and allied with the Spanish. At the time, it was common for young men to follow the lead of local powerful magnates which would explain the future eagerness of the crown to offer him service in the royal army. Vauban first saw action at Clermont-en-Argonne and was noticed by Condé as a diligent and energetic soldier that took a keen interest in the practices of siege warfare even at such a young age and he was sometimes entrusted with directing the improvement of local fortifications.

In early 1653, when Vauban worked on the defences of Sainte-Menehould, one of Condé&#x27;s principal possessions, he was captured by a Royalist patrol and switched sides, serving in the force led by Louis Nicolas de Clerville that took Sainte-Menehould in November 1653. Clerville, later appointed &quot;Commissaire général des fortifications&quot;, employed him on siege operations and building fortifications. In 1655, Vauban was appointed &quot;Ingénieur du Roi&quot; or Royal Engineer, and by the time the war with Spain ended in 1659, he was widely known as a talented engineer of energy and courage.

Under the terms of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, Spain ceded much of French Flanders, and Vauban was put in charge of fortifying newly acquired towns such as Dunkirk. This pattern of French territorial gains, followed by fortification of new strongpoints, was followed in the 1667–1668 War of Devolution, 1672–1678 Franco-Dutch War and 1683–1684 War of the Reunions.

The first fortification Vauban designed was the 1673 siege of Maastricht, although he was subordinate to Louis, who ranked as the senior officer present, and thus took credit for its capture. Vauban was rewarded with a large sum of money, which he used to purchase the Château de Bazouches from his cousin in 1675.

After 1673, French strategy in Flanders was based on a memorandum from Vauban to Louvois, Minister of War, setting out a proposed line of fortresses known as the &quot;Ceinture de fer&quot;, or &quot;iron belt&quot; (see Map). He was made &quot;Maréchal de camp&quot; in 1676, and succeeded Clerville as &quot;Commissaire general des fortifications&quot; in 1677.

During the Nine Years&#x27; War, Vauban inflicted a stinging defeat on an Anglo-Dutch invasion force at Camaret, supervised the capture of Namur in 1692, the major French achievement of the war, while the 1697 siege of Ath is often considered his offensive masterpiece. He was rewarded with money and rank: he was made Comte de Vauban, a member of the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Louis, and an Honorary Member of the French Academy of Sciences.

The numbers needed to conduct a siege, and prevent interference from opponents meant armies of the Nine Years&#x27; War often exceeded 100,000 men, sizes unsustainable for pre-industrial societies. This limitation prompted a change in tactics; Marlborough argued that winning one battle was more beneficial than taking 12 fortresses. The armies of the War of the Spanish Succession averaged around 35,000, and siege warfare was superseded by a greater emphasis on mobility. 
In 1702 Vauban was ordered by Louis to attack Hulst. He had however insufficent means available to him and so the Siege of Hulst remains the only siege in which Vauban was not successful as he was forced to retreat. The next year, Vauban directed his final siege, capturing Alt-Brisach and was promoted to Maréchal de France, marking the end of his military career, although the &quot;Ceinture de fer&quot; proved its worth after the French defeat at Ramillies in 1706. Under pressure from superior forces on multiple fronts, France&#x27;s northern border remained largely intact despite repeated efforts to break it. Capturing Lille cost the Allies 12,000 casualties and most of the 1708 campaigning season; the lack of progress between 1706 and 1712 enabled Louis to negotiate an acceptable peace at Utrecht in 1713, as opposed to the humiliating terms presented in 1707.

With more leisure time, Vauban developed a broader view of his role. His fortifications were designed for mutual support, so they required connecting roads, bridges and canals; garrisons needed to be fed, so he prepared maps showing the location of forges, forests and farms. Since these had to be paid for, he developed an interest in tax policy, and in 1707 published &quot;La Dîme royale&quot;, documenting the economic misery of the lower classes. His solution was a flat 10% tax on all agricultural and industrial output, and eliminating the exemptions which meant most of the nobility and clergy paid nothing. Although his work was confiscated and destroyed by royal decree, the use of statistics to support his arguments &quot;... establishes him as a founder of modern economics, and precursor of the Enlightenment&#x27;s socially concerned intellectuals.&quot;

In the course of his career, Vauban supervised or designed the building of more than 300 separate fortifications. By his own estimate, he supervised more than 40 sieges from 1653 to 1697.

==Personal life and death==

In 1660, Vauban married Jeanne d&#x27;Aunay d&#x27;Epiry (ca 1640–1705); they had two daughters, Charlotte (1661–1709) and Jeanne Françoise (1678–1713), as well as a short-lived infant son. He also had a long-term relationship with Marie-Antoinette de Puy-Montbrun, daughter of an exiled Huguenot officer, usually referred to as &#x27;Mademoiselle de Villefranche.&#x27;

Vauban died in Paris on 30 March 1707; he was buried near his home in Bazoches. His grave was destroyed during the French Revolution. In 1808, Napoleon I ordered his heart reburied in Les Invalides, the resting place of many of France&#x27;s most famous soldiers.

==Doctrines and legacy==
===Offensive doctrines; siege warfare===

While his modern fame rests on the fortifications he built, Vauban&#x27;s greatest innovations were in offensive operations, an approach he summarised as &#x27;More powder, less blood.&#x27; Initially reliant on existing concepts, he later adapted these on lines set out in his memorandum of March 1672, &quot;Mémoire pour servir à l&#x27;instruction dans la conduite des sièges&quot;.

In this period, sieges became the dominant form of warfare; during the 1672–1678 Franco-Dutch War, three battles were fought in the Spanish Netherlands, of which only Seneffe was unrelated to a siege. Their importance was heightened by Louis XIV, who viewed them as low-risk opportunities for demonstrating his military skill and increasing his prestige; he was present at 20 of those conducted by Vauban.

The &#x27;siege parallel&#x27; had been in development since the mid-16th century but Vauban brought the idea to practical fulfilment at Maastricht in 1673. Three parallel trenches were dug in front of the walls, the earth thus excavated being used to create embankments screening the attackers from defensive fire, while bringing them as close to the assault point as possible (see diagram). Artillery was moved into the trenches, allowing them to target the base of the walls at close range, with the defenders unable to depress their own guns enough to counter this; once a breach had been made, it was then stormed. This approach was used in offensive operations well into the 20th century.

However, Vauban adapted his approach to the situation, and did not use the siege parallel again until Valenciennes in 1677. Always willing to challenge accepted norms, at Valenciennes, he proposed assaulting the breach during the day, rather than at night as was normal practice. He argued this would reduce casualties by surprising the defenders, and allow better co-ordination among the assault force; he was supported by Louis, and the attack proved successful.

Vauban made several innovations in the use of siege artillery, including ricochet firing, and concentrating on specific parts of the fortifications, rather than targeting multiple targets. His Dutch rival Menno van Coehoorn employed a similar approach. While the &#x27;Van Coehoorn method&#x27; sought to overwhelm defences with massive firepower, such as the Grand Battery of 200 guns at Namur in 1695, Vauban preferred a more gradual approach. Both had their supporters; Vauban argued his was less costly in terms of casualties, but it took more time, an important consideration in an age when far more soldiers died from disease than in combat.

===Defensive doctrines; fortifications===
It was accepted even the strongest fortifications would fall, given time; the process was so well understood by the 1690s, betting on the length of a siege became a popular craze. As few states could afford large standing armies, defenders needed time to mobilise; to provide this, fortresses were designed to absorb the attackers&#x27; energies, similar to the use of crumple zones in modern cars. The French defence of Namur in 1695 showed &quot;how one could effectively win a campaign, by losing a fortress, but exhausting the besiegers.&quot;

As with the siege parallel, the strength of Vauban&#x27;s defensive designs was his ability to synthesise and adapt the work of others to create a more powerful whole. His first works used the &#x27;star-shape&#x27; or bastion fort design, also known as the &quot;trace Italienne&quot;, based on the designs of Antoine de Ville (1596–1656) and Blaise Pagan (1603–1665). His subsequent &#x27;systems&#x27; strengthened their internal works with the addition of casemated shoulders and flanks.

The principles of Vauban&#x27;s &#x27;second system&#x27; were set out in the 1683 work &quot;Le Directeur-Général des fortifications,&quot; and used at Landau and Mont-Royal, near Traben-Trarbach; both were advanced positions, intended as stepping-off points for French offensives into the Rhineland. Located above the Moselle, Mont-Royal had main walls high, long and space for 12,000 troops; this enormously expensive work was demolished when the French withdrew after the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, and only the foundations remain today. Fort-Louis was another new construction, built on an island in the middle of the Rhine; this allowed Vauban to combine his defensive principles with town planning, although like Mont-Royal, little of it remains.
The French retreat from the Rhine after 1697 required new fortresses; Neuf-Brisach was the most significant, designed on Vauban&#x27;s &#x27;third system&#x27;, and completed after his death by Louis de Cormontaigne. Using ideas from Fort-Louis, this incorporated a regular square grid street pattern inside an octagonal fortification; tenement blocks were built inside each curtain wall, strengthening the defensive walls and shielding more expensive houses from cannon fire.

To create a more coherent border, Vauban advocated destroying poor fortifications, and relinquishing territory that was hard to defend. In December 1672, he wrote to Louvois: &quot;I am not for the greater number of places, we already have too many, and please God we had half of that, but all in good condition!&quot;

Many of the fortifications designed by Vauban are still standing; in 2008, twelve groups of Vauban fortifications were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their exceptional engineering and influence on military fortifications from the 17th through the 20th centuries. 

===Infrastructure and engineering===
While often overlooked, Vauban worked on many civilian infrastructure projects, including rebuilding the ports of Brest, Dunkerque and Toulon. Since his fortifications were designed for mutual support, roads and waterways were an essential part of their design, such as the Canal de la Bruche, a canal built in 1682 to transport materials for the fortification of Strasbourg. As early as 1684, Vauban published design tables for retaining walls with heights between 3 and 25 metres. Three years later, Vauban, in his role as newly appointed Commissary General of all French fortifications, sent his engineers in the Corps du Génie Militaire his Profil général pour les murs de soutènement in which he presented his retaining wall profiles that were later adopted by engineering offers such as Bélidor (1729), Poncelet (1840) and Wheeler (1870). He also provided advice on the repair and enlargement of the Canal du Midi in 1686.

His holistic approach to urban planning, which integrated city defences with layout and infrastructure, is most obvious at Neuf-Brisach. His legacy is recognised in the Vauban district in Freiburg, named after a French army base on the same location, which developed as a model for sustainable neighbourhoods post-1998.

Vauban&#x27;s &#x27;scientific approach&#x27; and focus on large infrastructure projects strongly influenced American military and civil engineering and inspired the creation of the US Corps of Engineers in 1824. Until 1866, West Point&#x27;s curriculum was modelled on that of the French Ecole Polytechnique and designed to produce officers with skills in engineering and mathematics.

To ensure a steady supply of skilled engineers, in 1690 Vauban established the &quot;Corps royal des ingénieurs militaires&quot;; until his death, candidates had to pass an examination administered by Vauban himself. Young French Huguenots made up a disproportionately high number of successful engineers due to the social and educational characteristics of French Protestantism. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, a significant number of these engineers joined the English and Dutch armies to fight in Ireland, Flanders and Spain. Many of his publications, including &quot;Traité de l&#x27;attaque des places&quot; and &quot;Traité des mines&quot;, were written at the end of his career to provide a training curriculum for his successors.

==Assessment==

Vauban&#x27;s offensive tactics remained relevant for centuries; his principles were clearly identifiable in those used by the Việt Minh at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. His defensive fortifications dated far more quickly, partly due to the enormous investment required; Vauban himself estimated that in 1678, 1694 and 1705, between 40 and 45% of the French army was assigned to garrison duty.

Vauban&#x27;s reputation meant his designs remained in use long after developments in artillery made them obsolete, for example the Dutch fort of Bourtange, built in 1742. The &quot;Corps des ingénieurs militaires&quot; was based on his teachings; between 1699 and 1743, only 631 new candidates were accepted, the vast majority relatives of existing or former members. As a result, French military engineering became ultra-conservative, while many &#x27;new&#x27; works used his designs, or professed to do so, such as those built by Louis de Cortmontaigne at Metz in 1728–1733. This persisted into the late 19th century; Fort de Queuleu, built in 1867 near Metz, is recognisably a Vauban-style design.

Some French engineers continued to be innovators, notably the Marquis de Montalembert, who published &quot;La Fortification perpendiculaire&quot; in 1776. A rejection of the principles advocated by Vauban and his successors; his ideas became the prevailing orthodoxy in much of Europe but were dismissed in France.

<text>The Santalales are an order of flowering plants in the dicotyledons. Well-known members of the Santalales include sandalwoods and the many species of mistletoes. The order has a cosmopolitan distribution, but is heavily concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions. It derives its name from its type genus, &quot;Santalum&quot; (sandalwood).

== Overview ==
Many of the members of the order are parasitic plants, mostly hemiparasites, able to produce sugars through photosynthesis, but tapping the stems or roots of other plants to obtain water and minerals; some (e.g. &quot;Arceuthobium&quot;) are obligate parasites, have low concentrations of chlorophyll within their shoots (1/5 to 1/10 of that found in their host&#x27;s foliage), and derive the majority of their sustenance from their hosts&#x27; vascular tissues (water, micro- and macronutrients, and sucrose).

Most have seeds without testae (seed coats), which is unusual for flowering plants.

== Classification ==
The APG IV system of 2016 includes seven families. As in the earlier APG III system, it was accepted that Olacaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot; was paraphyletic but new family limits were not proposed as relationships were considered uncertain. , this seven-family division of the Santalales was explicitly accepted by the World Flora Online, and implicitly by Plants of the World Online, in that it accepted none of the extra families recognized by other sources. The seven families are:
* Balanophoraceae
* Loranthaceae
* Misodendraceae
* Olacaceae
* Opiliaceae
* Santalaceae
* Schoepfiaceae

When only these families are recognized, one possible phylogenetic relationship among them is shown below. Support for some of the nodes is weak, and at least two families, Olacaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; and Balanophoraceae &quot;s.l.&quot;, are not monophyletic: 
A summary of the circumscription and phylogeny of the Santalales published in 2020 used 20 rather than seven families. Olacaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; was divided into seven families, Balanophoraceae &quot;s.l.&quot; was divided into two, and Santalaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; into seven. , the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website accepted the families resulting from the division of Olacaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; and Balanophoraceae &quot;s.l.&quot; but not those from the division of Santalaceae &quot;s.l.&quot;
===Earlier systems===
In the classification system of Dahlgren, the Santalales were in the superorder Santaliflorae (also called Santalanae). The Cronquist system (1981) used this circumscription:
* order Santalales
:* family Medusandraceae – sole genus &quot;Medusandra&quot; now in family Peridiscaceae, order Saxifragales
:* family Dipentodontaceae – now in order Huerteales in APG IV
:* family Olacaceae
:* family Opiliaceae
:* family Santalaceae
:* family Misodendraceae
:* family Loranthaceae
:* family Viscaceae - sunk into Santalaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; in the seven-family system
:* family Eremolepidaceae - sunk into Santalaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; in the seven-family system
:* family Balanophoraceae

<text>Arales is an order of flowering plants. The name was used in the Cronquist system for an order placed in subclass &quot;Arecidae&quot;, circumscribed as (1981):

* order Arales
*: family Acoraceae
*: family Araceae
*: family Lemnaceae

In the classification system of Dahlgren the Arales were in the superorder Ariflorae (also called Aranae), but did not include Acoraceae as a separate family. Instead, &quot;Acorus&quot;, its only genus, was included in the Araceae. Arales was the only order included in the Ariflorae.

The APG II system elevates the first of these three families to become an order &quot;Acorales&quot; of its own (consisting of the single genus, &quot;Acorus&quot;) and unites the last two of these families into the one family &quot;Araceae&quot; assigning this to the order &quot;Alismatales&quot;.

<text>The Araceae are a family of monocotyledonous flowering plants in which flowers are borne on a type of inflorescence called a spadix. The spadix is usually accompanied by, and sometimes partially enclosed in, a spathe (or leaf-like bract). Also known as the arum family, members are often colloquially known as aroids. This family of 114 genera and about 3,750 known species is most diverse in the New World tropics, although also distributed in the Old World tropics and northern temperate regions.

==Description==

Within the Araceae, species are often rhizomatous or tuberous; many are epiphytic, creeping lianas or vining plants, and the leaves and tissues of the entire plant nearly always contains irritating calcium oxalate crystals or raphides, in varying degrees. The foliage can vary considerably from species to species. The majority of species produce an inflorescence consisting of a spadix (which some compare to a corn cob, in appearance), which is nearly always surrounded by a modified leaf bract called a spathe. In monoecious aroids, possessing separate male and female flowers (but with both flowers present on one plant), the spadix is usually organized with female flowers towards the bottom and male flowers at the top. In aroids with perfect flowers, the stigma is no longer receptive when the pollen is released, thus preventing self-fertilization. Some species are dioecious.

Many plants in this family are thermogenic (heat-producing). Their flowers can reach up to 45 °C, even if the surrounding air temperature is much lower. One reason for this unusually high temperature is to attract insects (usually beetles) to pollinate the plant, rewarding the beetles with heat energy, in addition to preventing tissue damage in colder regions. Some examples of thermogenic aroids are &quot;Symplocarpus foetidus&quot; (eastern skunk-cabbage),&quot; Amorphophallus titanum&quot; (titan arum),&quot; Amorphophallus paeoniifolius&quot; (elephant-foot yam), &quot;Helicodiceros muscivorus&quot; (dead-horse arum lily), and &quot;Sauromatum venosum&quot; (voodoo lily). Some species, such as &quot;A&quot;. &quot;titanum&quot; and &quot;H&quot;. &quot;muscivorus&quot;, give off a very pungent smell akin to rotten meat, which serves to attract flies for pollination. The heat produced by the plant helps to convey the scent further.

===Toxicity===

Within the Araceae family, the majority of species produce calcium oxalate crystals in the form of raphides. While it is possible to consume the cooked foliage of certain genera, such as &quot;Alocasia&quot;, &quot;Colocasia&quot;, and &quot;Xanthosoma&quot;, as well as the ripened fruits of &quot;Monstera deliciosa&quot;, these raphide compounds are irritating (and even dangerous) for many animals, including humans. Consumption of raw aroid vegetation may cause edema, vesicle formation or dysphagia, accompanied by a painful stinging and burning in the mouth and throat, with symptoms occurring for up to two weeks, depending on amount consumed. In smaller amounts, patients report feeling a mild to extreme sensation of sand or glass in the esophagus and mouth, lasting up to 48 hours. Additionally, in heavier instances of ingestion, anaphylactic shock could cause swelling of the throat, restricting breathing. The genus &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot; is famously known as &quot;dumb-cane&quot; for this reason; however, given the presence of irritating compounds across the family, this nickname may be applied to virtually any genera within the Araceae.

==Taxonomy==

===Phylogeny===
Phylogeny based on the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website.

===Classification===
One of the earliest observations of species in the Araceae was conducted by Theophrastus in his work &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot;. The Araceae were not recognized as a distinct group of plants until the 16th century. In 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu classified all climbing aroids as &quot;Pothos&quot; and all terrestrial aroids as either &quot;Arum&quot; or &quot;Dracontium&quot; in his book &quot;Familles des Plantes&quot;.

The first major system of classification for the family was produced by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott, who published &quot;Genera Aroidearum&quot; in 1858 and &quot;Prodromus Systematis Aroidearum&quot; in 1860. Schott&#x27;s system was based on floral characteristics, and used a narrow conception of a genus. Adolf Engler produced a classification in 1876, which was steadily refined up to 1920. His system is significantly different from Schott&#x27;s, being based more on vegetative characters and anatomy. The two systems were to some extent rivals, with Engler&#x27;s having more adherents before the advent of molecular phylogenetics brought new approaches.

A comprehensive taxonomy of Araceae was published by Mayo et al. in 1997.

Modern studies based on gene sequences show the Araceae (including the Lemnoideae, duckweeds) to be monophyletic, and the first diverging group within the Alismatales. The APG III system of 2009 recognizes the family, including the genera formerly segregated in the Lemnaceae. The sinking of the Lemnaceae into the Araceae was not immediately universally accepted. For example, the 2010 &quot;New Flora of the British Isles&quot; used a paraphyletic Araceae and a separate Lemnaceae. However &quot;Lemna&quot; and its allies were incorporated in Araceae in the 2019 edition. A comprehensive genomic study of &quot;Spirodela polyrhiza&quot; was published in February 2014.

===Genera===


143 genera are accepted within the Araceae. &quot;Anthurium&quot;, &quot;Epipremnum&quot;, &quot;Monstera&quot;, &quot;Philodendron&quot; and &quot;Zantedeschia&quot; are some of the most well-known genera of the family, as are the &quot;Colocasia&quot; (taro, &quot;arbi&quot;) and &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; (&#x27;elephant-ear&#x27;, ‘ape), which are both cultivated for human consumption. The largest unbranched inflorescence in the world is that of the arum &quot;Amorphophallus titanum&quot; (titan arum). 

The Araceae includes many ornamental genera of global economic importance: &quot;Aglaonema&quot;, &quot;Alocasia&quot;, &quot;Anthurium&quot;, &quot;Caladium&quot;, &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot;, &quot;Epipremnum&quot;, &quot;Homalomena, Monstera&quot;, &quot;Nephthytis&quot;, &quot;Rhaphidophora&quot;, &quot;Scindapsus&quot;, &quot;Spathiphyllum&quot;, &quot;Syngonium&quot;, and &quot;Zamioculcas&quot;, to name but a few. The aquatic genera &quot;Anubias&quot;, &quot;Bucephalandra&quot; and &quot;Cryptocoryne&quot; are highly prized and cultivated aquarium plants; other, recently-described genera, such as the &quot;Lagenandra&quot; of India, are gradually becoming more known in the aquascaping world. &quot;Philodendron&quot; is an important genus in the ecosystems of neotropical rainforests, and is widely used in home and interior decorating. &quot;Symplocarpus foetidus&quot; (skunk cabbage) is a common eastern North American species. An interesting peculiarity is that this family includes the largest unbranched inflorescence, that of the titan arum, often erroneously called the &quot;largest flower&quot;, and the smallest flowering plant and smallest fruit, in the duckweed, &quot;Wolffia&quot;. 

==Fossil record==

The family Araceae has one of the oldest fossil record among angiosperms, with fossil forms first appearing during the Early Cretaceous epoch. Notable fossils from the Early Cretaceous include: &quot;Spixiarum kipea&quot;, an aroid from the late Aptian of Brazil; &quot;Orontiophyllum ferreri&quot;, an aroid leaf from the late Albian of Spain; and &quot;Turolospadix bogneri&quot;, an aroid spadix from the late Albian of Spain.

==Food plants==

Food plants in the family Araceae include &quot;Amorphophallus paeoniifolius&quot; (elephant foot yam), &quot;Colocasia esculenta&quot; (kochu, taro, dasheen), &quot;Xanthosoma&quot; (cocoyam, tannia), &quot;Typhonium trilobatum&quot; and &quot;Monstera deliciosa&quot; (Mexican breadfruit). While the aroids are little traded, and overlooked by plant breeders to the extent that the Crop Trust calls them &quot;orphan crops&quot;, they are widely grown and are important in subsistence agriculture and in local markets. The main food product is the corm, which is high in starch; leaves and flowers also find culinary use.

<text>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client–server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a plain-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).

The first FTP client applications were command-line programs developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are still shipped with most Windows, Unix, and Linux operating systems. Many dedicated FTP clients and automation utilities have since been developed for desktops, servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been incorporated into productivity applications such as HTML editors and file managers.

An FTP client used to be commonly integrated in web browsers, where file servers are browsed with the URI prefix &quot;codice_1&quot;. In 2021, FTP support was dropped by Google Chrome and Firefox, two major web browser vendors, due to it being superseded by the more secure SFTP and FTPS; although neither of them have implemented the newer protocols.

==History of FTP servers==
The original specification for the File Transfer Protocol was written by Abhay Bhushan and published as on 16 April 1971. Until 1980, FTP ran on NCP, the predecessor of TCP/IP. The protocol was later replaced by a TCP/IP version, (June 1980) and (October 1985), the current specification. Several proposed standards amend , for example (February 1994) enables Firewall-Friendly FTP (passive mode), (June 1997) proposes security extensions, (September 1998) adds support for IPv6 and defines a new type of passive mode.

==Protocol overview== 

===Communication and data transfer===

FTP may run in &quot;active&quot; or &quot;passive&quot; mode, which determines how the data connection is established. (This sense of &quot;mode&quot; is different from that of the MODE command in the FTP protocol.)
* In active mode, the client starts listening for incoming data connections from the server on port M. It sends the FTP command PORT M to inform the server on which port it is listening. The server then initiates a data channel to the client from its port 20, the FTP server data port.
* In situations where the client is behind a firewall and unable to accept incoming TCP connections, &quot;passive mode&quot; may be used. In this mode, the client uses the control connection to send a PASV command to the server and then receives a server IP address and server port number from the server, which the client then uses to open a data connection from an arbitrary client port to the server IP address and server port number received.
Both modes were updated in September 1998 to support IPv6. Further changes were introduced to the passive mode at that time, updating it to &quot;extended passive mode&quot;.

The server responds over the control connection with three-digit status codes in ASCII with an optional text message. For example, &quot;200&quot; (or &quot;200 OK&quot;) means that the last command was successful. The numbers represent the code for the response and the optional text represents a human-readable explanation or request (e.g. &lt;Need account for storing file&gt;). An ongoing transfer of file data over the data connection can be aborted using an interrupt message sent over the control connection.

FTP needs two ports (one for sending and one for receiving) because it was originally designed to operate on top of Network Control Protocol (NCP), which was a simplex protocol that utilized two port addresses, establishing two connections, for two-way communications. An odd and an even port were reserved for each application layer application or protocol. The standardization of TCP and UDP reduced the need for the use of two simplex ports for each application down to one duplex port, but the FTP protocol was never altered to only use one port, and continued using two for backwards compatibility.

===NAT and firewall traversal===
FTP normally transfers data by having the server connect back to the client, after the PORT command is sent by the client. This is problematic for both NATs and firewalls, which do not allow connections from the Internet towards internal hosts. For NATs, an additional complication is that the representation of the IP addresses and port number in the PORT command refer to the internal host&#x27;s IP address and port, rather than the public IP address and port of the NAT.

There are two approaches to solve this problem. One is that the FTP client and FTP server use the PASV command, which causes the data connection to be established from the FTP client to the server. This is widely used by modern FTP clients. Another approach is for the NAT to alter the values of the PORT command, using an application-level gateway for this purpose.
===Data types===
While transferring data over the network, five data types are defined:
* ASCII (TYPE A): Used for text. Data is converted, if needed, from the sending host&#x27;s character representation to &quot;8-bit ASCII&quot; before transmission, and (again, if necessary) to the receiving host&#x27;s character representation, including newlines. As a consequence, this mode is inappropriate for files that contain data other than ASCII.
* Image (TYPE I, commonly called Binary mode): The sending machine sends each file byte by byte, and the recipient stores the bytestream as it receives it. (Image mode support has been recommended for all implementations of FTP).
* EBCDIC (TYPE E): Used for plain text between hosts using the EBCDIC character set.
* Local (TYPE L &quot;n&quot;): Designed to support file transfer between machines which do not use 8-bit bytes, e.g. 36-bit systems such as DEC PDP-10s. For example, &quot;TYPE L 9&quot; would be used to transfer data in 9-bit bytes, or &quot;TYPE L 36&quot; to transfer 36-bit words. Most contemporary FTP clients/servers only support L 8, which is equivalent to I.
* Unicode text files using UTF-8 (TYPE U): defined in an expired Internet Draft which never became an RFC, though it has been implemented by several FTP clients/servers.

Note these data types are commonly called &quot;modes&quot;, although ambiguously that word is also used to refer to active-vs-passive communication mode (see above), and the modes set by the FTP protocol MODE command (see below).

For text files (TYPE A and TYPE E), three different format control options are provided, to control how the file would be printed:
* Non-print (TYPE A N and TYPE E N) – the file does not contain any carriage control characters intended for a printer
* Telnet (TYPE A T and TYPE E T) – the file contains Telnet (or in other words, ASCII C0) carriage control characters (CR, LF, etc)
* ASA (TYPE A A and TYPE E A) – the file contains ASA carriage control characters
These formats were mainly relevant to line printers; most contemporary FTP clients/servers only support the default format control of N.

===File structures===
File organization is specified using the STRU command. The following file structures are defined in section 3.1.1 of RFC959:
* F or FILE structure (stream-oriented). Files are viewed as an arbitrary sequence of bytes, characters or words. This is the usual file structure on Unix systems and other systems such as CP/M, MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. (Section 3.1.1.1)
* R or RECORD structure (record-oriented). Files are viewed as divided into records, which may be fixed or variable length. This file organization is common on mainframe and midrange systems, such as MVS, VM/CMS, OS/400 and VMS, which support record-oriented filesystems.
* P or PAGE structure (page-oriented). Files are divided into pages, which may either contain data or metadata; each page may also have a header giving various attributes. This file structure was specifically designed for TENEX systems, and is generally not supported on other platforms. RFC1123 section 4.1.2.3 recommends that this structure not be implemented.

Most contemporary FTP clients and servers only support STRU F. STRU R is still in use in mainframe and minicomputer file transfer applications.

===Data transfer modes===
Data transfer can be done in any of three modes:
* Stream mode (MODE S): Data is sent as a continuous stream, relieving FTP from doing any processing. Rather, all processing is left up to TCP. No End-of-file indicator is needed, unless the data is divided into records.
* Block mode (MODE B): Designed primarily for transferring record-oriented files (STRU R), although can also be used to transfer stream-oriented (STRU F) text files. FTP puts each record (or line) of data into several blocks (block header, byte count, and data field) and then passes it on to TCP.
* Compressed mode (MODE C): Extends MODE B with data compression using run-length encoding.

Most contemporary FTP clients and servers do not implement MODE B or MODE C; FTP clients and servers for mainframe and minicomputer operating systems are the exception to that.

Some FTP software also implements a DEFLATE-based compressed mode, sometimes called &quot;Mode Z&quot; after the command that enables it. This mode was described in an Internet Draft, but not standardized.

GridFTP defines additional modes, MODE E and MODE X, as extensions of MODE B.

===Additional commands===
More recent implementations of FTP support the &quot;Modify Fact: Modification Time&quot; (MFMT) command, which allows a client to adjust that file attribute remotely, enabling the preservation of that attribute when uploading files.

To retrieve a remote file timestamp, there&#x27;s &quot;MDTM&quot; command. Some servers (and clients) support nonstandard syntax of the &quot;MDTM&quot; command with two arguments, that works the same way as &quot;MFMT&quot;

==Login==

FTP login uses normal username and password scheme for granting access. The username is sent to the server using the USER command, and the password is sent using the PASS command. This sequence is unencrypted &quot;on the wire&quot;, so may be vulnerable to a network sniffing attack. If the information provided by the client is accepted by the server, the server will send a greeting to the client and the session will commence. If the server supports it, users may log in without providing login credentials, but the same server may authorize only limited access for such sessions.

===Anonymous FTP===
A host that provides an FTP service may provide anonymous FTP access. Users typically log into the service with an &#x27;anonymous&#x27; (lower-case and case-sensitive in some FTP servers) account when prompted for user name. Although users are commonly asked to send their email address instead of a password, no verification is actually performed on the supplied data. Many FTP hosts whose purpose is to provide software updates will allow anonymous logins.

==Software support==
=== File managers ===
Many file managers tend to have FTP access implemented, such as File Explorer (formerly Windows Explorer) on Microsoft Windows. This client is only recommended for small file transfers from a server, due to limitations compared to dedicated client software. It does not support SFTP.

Both the native file managers for KDE on Linux (Dolphin and Konqueror) support FTP as well as SFTP.

On Android, the My Files file manager on Samsung Galaxy has a built-in FTP and SFTP client.

===Web browser===
For a long time, most common web browsers were able to retrieve files hosted on FTP servers, although not all of them had support for protocol extensions such as FTPS. When an FTP—rather than an HTTP—URL is supplied, the accessible contents on the remote server are presented in a manner that is similar to that used for other web content. 

Google Chrome removed FTP support entirely in Chrome 88, also affecting other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge. Firefox 88 disabled FTP support by default, with Firefox 90 dropping support entirely.

FireFTP is a discontinued browser extension that was designed as a full-featured FTP client to be run within Firefox, but when Firefox dropped support for FTP the extension developer recommended using Waterfox. Some browsers, such as the text-based Lynx, still support FTP.

====Syntax====
FTP URL syntax is described in , taking the form: codice_2 (the bracketed parts are optional).

For example, the URL ftp://public.ftp-servers.example.com/mydirectory/myfile.txt represents the file &quot;myfile.txt&quot; from the directory &quot;mydirectory&quot; on the server &quot;public.ftp-servers.example.com&quot; as an FTP resource. The URL ftp://user001:secretpassword@private.ftp-servers.example.com/mydirectory/myfile.txt adds a specification of the username and password that must be used to access this resource.

More details on specifying a username and password may be found in the browsers&#x27; documentation (e.g., Firefox and Internet Explorer). By default, most web browsers use passive (PASV) mode, which more easily traverses end-user firewalls.

Some variation has existed in how different browsers treat path resolution in cases where there is a non-root home directory for a user.

===Download manager===
Most common download managers can receive files hosted on FTP servers, while some of them also give the interface to retrieve the files hosted on FTP servers. DownloadStudio allows not only download a file from FTP server but also view the list of files on a FTP server.

===Other===
LibreOffice declared its FTP support deprecated from 7.4 release, this was later removed in 24.2 release.

==Security==
FTP was not designed to be a secure protocol, and has many security weaknesses. In May 1999, the authors of listed a vulnerability to the following problems:
* Brute-force attack
* FTP bounce attack
* Packet capture
* Port stealing (guessing the next open port and usurping a legitimate connection)
* Spoofing attack
* Username enumeration
* DoS or DDoS

FTP does not encrypt its traffic; all transmissions are in clear text, and usernames, passwords, commands and data can be read by anyone able to perform packet capture (sniffing) on the network. This problem is common to many of the Internet Protocol specifications (such as SMTP, Telnet, POP and IMAP) that were designed prior to the creation of encryption mechanisms such as TLS or SSL.

Common solutions to this problem include:
# Using the secure versions of the insecure protocols, e.g., FTPS instead of FTP and TelnetS instead of Telnet.
# Using a different, more secure protocol that can handle the job, e.g. SSH File Transfer Protocol or Secure Copy Protocol.
# Using a secure tunnel such as Secure Shell (SSH) or virtual private network (VPN).

===FTP over SSH=== 
FTP over SSH is the practice of tunneling a normal FTP session over a Secure Shell connection. Because FTP uses multiple TCP connections (unusual for a TCP/IP protocol that is still in use), it is particularly difficult to tunnel over SSH. With many SSH clients, attempting to set up a tunnel for the control channel (the initial client-to-server connection on port 21) will protect only that channel; when data is transferred, the FTP software at either end sets up new TCP connections (data channels) and thus have no confidentiality or integrity protection.

Otherwise, it is necessary for the SSH client software to have specific knowledge of the FTP protocol, to monitor and rewrite FTP control channel messages and autonomously open new packet forwardings for FTP data channels. Software packages that support this mode include:
* Tectia ConnectSecure (Win/Linux/Unix) of SSH Communications Security&#x27;s software suite

FTP over SSH should not be confused with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).

==Derivatives==

===FTPS===

Explicit FTPS is an extension to the FTP standard that allows clients to request FTP sessions to be encrypted. This is done by sending the &quot;AUTH TLS&quot; command. The server has the option of allowing or denying connections that do not request TLS. This protocol extension is defined in . Implicit FTPS is an outdated standard for FTP that required the use of a SSL or TLS connection. It was specified to use different ports than plain FTP.

===SSH File Transfer Protocol===

The SSH file transfer protocol (chronologically the second of the two protocols abbreviated SFTP) transfers files and has a similar command set for users, but uses the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) to transfer files. Unlike FTP, it encrypts both commands and data, preventing passwords and sensitive information from being transmitted openly over the network. It cannot interoperate with FTP software, though some FTP client software offers support for the SSH file transfer protocol as well.

===Trivial File Transfer Protocol ===

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple, lock-step FTP that allows a client to get a file from or put a file onto a remote host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of booting from a local area network, because TFTP is very simple to implement. TFTP lacks security and most of the advanced features offered by more robust file transfer protocols such as File Transfer Protocol. TFTP was first standardized in 1981 and the current specification for the protocol can be found in .

===Simple File Transfer Protocol===

Simple File Transfer Protocol (the first protocol abbreviated SFTP), as defined by , was proposed as an (unsecured) file transfer protocol with a level of complexity intermediate between TFTP and FTP. It was never widely accepted on the Internet, and is now assigned Historic status by the IETF. It runs through port 115, and often receives the initialism of &quot;SFTP&quot;. It has a command set of 11 commands and support three types of data transmission: ASCII, binary and continuous. For systems with a word size that is a multiple of 8 bits, the implementation of binary and continuous is the same. The protocol also supports login with user ID and password, hierarchical folders and file management (including &quot;rename&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;upload&quot;, &quot;download&quot;, &quot;download with overwrite&quot;, and &quot;download with append&quot;).

==FTP commands==
==FTP reply codes==

Below is a summary of FTP reply codes that may be returned by an FTP server. These codes have been standardized in by the IETF. The reply code is a three-digit value. The first digit is used to indicate one of three possible outcomes — success, failure, or to indicate an error or incomplete reply:
* 2yz – Success reply
* 4yz or 5yz – Failure reply
* 1yz or 3yz – Error or Incomplete reply

The second digit defines the kind of error:
* x0z – Syntax. These replies refer to syntax errors.
* x1z – Information. Replies to requests for information.
* x2z – Connections. Replies referring to the control and data connections.
* x3z – Authentication and accounting. Replies for the login process and accounting procedures.
* x4z – Not defined.
* x5z – File system. These replies relay status codes from the server file system.

The third digit of the reply code is used to provide additional detail for each of the categories defined by the second digit.

<text>Coca is any of the four cultivated plants in the family Erythroxylaceae, native to western South America. Coca is known worldwide for its psychoactive alkaloid, cocaine.

Different early-Holocene peoples in different areas of South America independently transformed &quot;Erythroxylum gracilipes&quot; plants into quotidian stimulant and medicinal crops now collectively called Coca. Archaeobotanical evidence show that Coca crops have been grown for well over 8,000 years in South America. They have had and still have a significant role in spiritual, economic, social and political dimensions for numerous indigenous cultures in the Andes and the Western Amazon arising from the use of the leaves as drugs and mild, daily stimulant.

The plant is grown as a cash crop in the Argentine Northwest, Bolivia, Alto Rio Negro Territory in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru, even in areas where its cultivation is unlawful. There are some reports that the plant is being cultivated in the south of Mexico, by using seeds imported from South America, as an alternative to smuggling its recreational product cocaine.
It also plays a fundamental role in many traditional Amazonian and Andean cultures as well as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.

The cocaine alkaloid content of dry &quot;Erythroxylum coca&quot; var. &quot;coca&quot; leaves was measured ranging from 0.23% to 0.96%. Coca-Cola used coca leaf extract in its products from 1885 until about 1903, when it began using decocainized leaf extract. Extraction of cocaine from coca requires several solvents and a chemical process known as an acid–base extraction, which can fairly easily extract the alkaloids from the plant.

== Description ==
The coca plant resembles a blackthorn bush, and grows to a height of . The branches are curved, and the leaves are thin, opaque, oval, and taper at the extremities. A marked characteristic of the leaf is an areolated portion bounded by two longitudinal curved lines, one line on each side of the midrib, and more conspicuous on the under face of the leaf.

The flowers are small, and disposed in clusters on short stalks; the corolla is composed of five yellowish-white petals, the anthers are heart-shaped, and the pistil consists of three carpels united to form a three-chambered ovary. The flowers mature into red berries.

The leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of the moth &quot;Eloria noyesi&quot;.

== Species and evolution ==
There are two species of coca crops, each with two varieties:
*&quot;Erythroxylum coca&quot;
**&quot;Erythroxylum coca&quot; var. &quot;coca&quot; (Bolivian or Huánuco Coca) – well adapted to the eastern Andes of Peru and Bolivia, an area of humid, tropical, montane forest.
**&quot;Erythroxylum coca&quot; var. &quot;ipadu&quot; (Amazonian Coca) – cultivated in the lowland Amazon Basin in Peru and Colombia.
*&quot;Erythroxylum novogranatense&quot;
**&quot;Erythroxylum novogranatense&quot; var. &quot;novogranatense&quot; (Colombian Coca) – a highland variety that is utilized in lowland areas. It is cultivated in drier regions found in Colombia. However, &quot;E. novogranatense&quot; is very adaptable to varying ecological conditions. The leaves have parallel lines on either side of the central vein. These plants are called &quot;Hayo&quot; or &quot;Ayu&quot; among certain groups in Venezuela and Colombia.
**&quot;Erythroxylum novogranatense&quot; var. &quot;truxillense&quot; (Trujillo Coca) – grown primarily in the Cajamarca and Amazonas states in Peru, including for the Empresa Nacional de la Coca S.A. and export by Coca-Cola for beverage flavoring.

All four of the cultivated cocas were domesticated from &quot;Erythroxylum gracilipes&quot; in pre-Columbian times, with significant archaeological sites reaching from Colombia to northern Chile, including the Las Vegas Culture in Ecuador, the Huaca Prieta site in Peru, and the Nanchoc valley in Peru – where leaf fragments and lime &quot;cal&quot; additives have been dated to over 8,000 years before present.

An initial theory of the origin and evolution of the cocas by Plowman and Bohm suggested that &quot;Erythroxylum coca&quot; var. &quot;coca&quot; is ancestral, while &quot;Erythroxylum novogranatense&quot; var. &quot;truxillense&quot; is derived from it to be drought tolerant, and &quot;Erythroxylum novogranatense&quot; var. &quot;novogranatense&quot; was further derived from &quot;Erythroxylum novogranatense&quot; var. &quot;truxillense&quot; in a linear series. In addition, E. coca var. ipadu was separately derived from &quot;E. coca&quot; var. &quot;coca&quot; when plants were taken into the Amazon basin.

Genetic evidence (Johnson et al. in 2005, Emche et al. in 2011, and Islam 2011) does not support this linear evolution. None of the four coca varieties are found in the wild, despite prior speculation by Plowman that wild populations of E. coca var. coca occur in the Huánuco and San Martín provinces of Peru. Recent phylogenetic evidence shows the closest wild relatives of the coca crops are &quot;Erythroxylum gracilipes&quot; Peyr. and &quot;Erythroxylum cataractarum&quot; Spruce ex. Peyr, and dense sampling of these species along with the coca crops from throughout their geographic ranges supports independent origins of domestication of &quot;Erythroxylum novogranatense&quot; and &quot;Erythroxylum coca&quot; from ancestor &quot;Erythroxylum gracilipes&quot;. It is possible that Amazonian coca was produced by yet a third independent domestication event from &quot;Erythroxylum gracilipes&quot;.

Thus, different early-Holocene peoples in different areas of South America independently transformed &quot;Erythroxylum gracilipes&quot; plants into quotidian stimulant and medicinal crops now collectively called coca.

=== Herbicide resistant varieties ===
Also known as &quot;supercoca&quot; or &quot;la millionaria&quot;, Boliviana negra is a relatively new form of coca that is resistant to a herbicide called glyphosate. Glyphosate is a key ingredient in the multibillion-dollar aerial coca eradication campaign undertaken by the government of Colombia with U.S. financial and military backing known as Plan Colombia.

The herbicide resistance of this strain has at least two possible explanations: that a &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; network of coca farmers used selective breeding to enhance this trait through tireless effort, or the plant was genetically modified in a laboratory. In 1996, a patented glyphosate-resistant soybean was marketed by Monsanto Company, suggesting that it would be possible to genetically modify coca in an analogous manner. Spraying &quot;Boliviana negra&quot; with glyphosate would serve to strengthen its growth by eliminating the non-resistant weeds surrounding it. Joshua Davis, in the &quot;Wired&quot; article cited below, found no evidence of CP4 EPSPS, a protein produced by the glyphosate-resistant soybean, suggesting &quot;Bolivana negra&quot; was either created in a lab by a different technique or bred in the field.

== Cultivation ==


Coca is traditionally cultivated in the lower altitudes of the eastern slopes of the Andes (the Yungas), or the highlands depending on the species grown. Coca production begins in the valleys and upper jungle regions of the Andean region, where the countries of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are host to more than 98 percent of the global land area planted with coca. In the early 19th century, coca was cultivated in what is today the Dominican Republic (see Mayorasgo de Koka). In 2014, coca plantations were discovered in Mexico, and in 2020 in Honduras, which could have major implications for the illegal cultivation of the plant.

The seeds are sown from December to January in small plots () sheltered from the sun, and the young plants when at in height are placed in final planting holes (), or if the ground is level, in furrows () in carefully weeded soil. The plants thrive best in hot, damp and humid locations, such as the clearings of forests; but the leaves most preferred are obtained in drier areas, on the hillsides. The leaves are gathered from plants varying in age from one and a half to upwards of forty years, but only the new fresh growth is harvested. They are considered ready for plucking when they break on being bent. The first and most abundant harvest is in March after the rainy season, the second is at the end of June, and the third in October or November. The green leaves (&quot;matu&quot;) are spread in thin layers on coarse woollen cloths and dried in the sun; they are then packed in sacks, which must be kept dry in order to preserve the quality of the leaves.
== Pharmacological aspects ==

The pharmacologically active ingredient of coca is the cocaine alkaloid, which has a concentration of about 0.3 to 1.5%, averaging 0.8%, in fresh leaves. Besides cocaine, the coca leaf contains a number of other alkaloids, including methylecgonine cinnamate, benzoylecgonine, truxilline, hydroxytropacocaine, tropacocaine, ecgonine, cuscohygrine, dihydrocuscohygrine, and hygrine. When chewed, coca acts as a mild stimulant and suppresses hunger, thirst, pain, and fatigue. Absorption of coca from the leaf is less rapid than nasal application of purified forms of the alkaloid (almost all of the coca alkaloid is absorbed within 20 minutes of nasal application, while it takes 2–12 hours after ingestion of the raw leaf for alkaline concentrations to peak.). When the raw leaf is consumed in tea, between 59 and 90% of the coca alkaloid is absorbed.

Coca users ingest between 60 and 80 milligrams of cocaine each time they chew the leaves according to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The coca leaf, when consumed in its natural form, does not induce a physiological or psychological dependence, nor does abstinence after long-term use produce symptoms typical to substance addiction. Due to its alkaloid content and non-addictive properties, coca has been suggested as a method to help recovering cocaine addicts to wean off the drug.

== History ==
Traces of coca leaves found in northern Peru dates the communal chewing of coca with lime (the alkaline mineral, not the citrus fruit) 8,000 years back. Other evidence of coca traces have been found in mummies dating 3,000 years back in northern Chile. Beginning with the Valdivian culture, , there is an unbroken record of coca leaf consumption by succeeding cultural groups on the coast of Ecuador until European arrival as shown in their ceramic sculpture and abundant caleros or lime pots. Lime containers found in the north coast of Peru date around 2000 BC as evidenced by the findings at Huaca Prieta and the Jetetepeque river valley. Extensive archaeological evidence for the chewing of coca leaves dates back at least to the 6th century AD Moche period, and the subsequent Inca period, based on mummies found with a supply of coca leaves, pottery depicting the characteristic cheek bulge of a coca chewer, spatulas for extracting alkali and figured bags for coca leaves and lime made from precious metals, and gold representations of coca in special gardens of the Inca in Cuzco.

Coca chewing may originally have been limited to the eastern Andes before its introduction to the Inca. As the plant was viewed as having a divine origin, its cultivation became subject to a state monopoly and its use restricted to nobles and a few favored classes (court orators, couriers, favored public workers, and the army) by the rule of the Topa Inca (1471–1493). As the Incan empire declined, the leaf became more widely available. After some deliberation, Philip II of Spain issued a decree recognizing the drug as essential to the well-being of the Andean Indians but urging missionaries to end its religious use. The Spanish are believed to have effectively encouraged use of coca by an increasing majority of the population to increase their labor output and tolerance for starvation, but it is not clear that this was planned deliberately.

Andean people first started chewing coca leaf (Ertyhroxylum) and its popularity has been spread throughout the Northern and Central Andes, making its way down to Southern Central America, including areas like Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. The coca leaf itself includes the active cocaine alkaloid which may be released through chewing or consumed in a powder-like form. This powder is usually extracted and made from burnt plant ashes, limestone or granite, and seashells. Andean people living in Central America have used a method to withdraw the lime from the coca plant using containers with sticks and have been able to indicate whether the coca leaves were either chewed historically even though many coca leaves haven&#x27;t been discovered by archaeologists. There have been numerous effects that have been noted from the coca leaf as they are milder and more concentrated compared to pure cocaine. When Andean people began to first use the coca leaf, they noticed that it could produce a &quot;high&quot; and can be very addictive compared to tobacco if consumed in large quantities. Many Andean and Inca civilizations used to chew the coca leaf instead of consuming it as it provided a better &quot;high&quot; experience. Because of its strong addiction and high, the Incas only allowed this substance within honorary celebrations and rituals. Workers dealing with rigorous tasks such as long-distance travels, and more were allowed to take the substance as it eased their hardships along the way. There is little history before Andean people and the Incas to indicate if coca was restricted before these times and what instances it was initially used in. Sometimes coca leaves from the plant were used as offerings in rituals. Due to the nature of politics and religion in the Inca Empire, wealthy inhabitants handed out coca leaves during ritual ceremonies.

Coca was first introduced to Europe in the 16th century, but did not become popular until the mid-19th century, with the publication of an influential paper by Dr. Paolo Mantegazza praising its stimulating effects on cognition. This led to the invention of coca wine and the first production of pure cocaine. Coca wine (of which Vin Mariani was the best-known brand) and other coca-containing preparations were widely sold as patent medicines and tonics, with claims of a wide variety of health benefits. The original version of Coca-Cola was among these. These products became illegal in most countries outside of South America in the early 20th century, after the addictive nature of cocaine was widely recognized. In 1859, Albert Niemann of the University of Göttingen became the first person to isolate the chief alkaloid of coca, which he named &quot;cocaine&quot;.

In the early 20th century, the Dutch colony of Java became a leading exporter of coca leaf. By 1912 shipments to Amsterdam, where the leaves were processed into cocaine, reached 1000 tons, overtaking the Peruvian export market. Apart from the years of the First World War, Java remained a greater exporter of coca than Peru until the end of the 1920s. Other colonial powers also tried to grow coca (including the British in India), but with the exception of the Japanese in Formosa, these were relatively unsuccessful.

In recent times (2006), the governments of several South American countries, such as Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela, have defended and championed the traditional use of coca, as well as the modern uses of the leaf and its extracts in household products such as teas and toothpaste. The coca plant was also the inspiration for Bolivia&#x27;s Coca Museum.

==Coca use by the Incas==

===Ethnohistorical sources===
While many historians are in agreement that coca was a contributing factor to the daily life of the Inca, there are many different theories as to how this civilization came to adopt it as one of its staple crops and as a valued commodity. The Incas were able to accomplish significant things while stimulated by the effects of coca. The Incas did not have a graphical written language, but used the &quot;quipu&quot;, a fiber recording device. Spanish documents make it clear that coca was one of the most important elements of Inca culture. Coca was used in Inca feasts and religious rituals, among many other things. It was a driving factor in the labor efforts that Inca kings asked of their citizens, and also used to barter for other goods. Coca was vital to the Inca civilization and its culture. The Incas valued coca so much that they colonized tropical rain forests to the north and east of their capital in Cuzco so that they could increase and control their supply. The Incas colonized more humid regions because coca cannot grow above 2600 meters in elevation (coca is not frost-resistant).

===Coca use in labor and military service===
One of the most common uses of coca during the reign of the Inca was in the context of &quot;mit&#x27;a&quot; labor, a labor tax required of all able-bodied men in the Inca empire, and also in military service. Pedro Cieza de León wrote that the indigenous people of the Andes always seemed to have coca in their mouths. &quot;Mit&#x27;a&quot; laborers, soldiers, and others chewed coca to alleviate hunger and thirst while they were working and fighting. The results of this are evident in monumental construction and the successful expansion of the Inca empire through conquest. By chewing coca, laborers and soldiers were able to work harder and for longer periods. Some historians believe that coca and &quot;chicha&quot; (fermented corn beer) made it possible for the Incas to move large stones in order to create architectural masterpieces, especially ones of monolithic construction such as Sacsayhuamán.

===Coca use in religious rituals===
Due to the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the Spaniards had direct access to the Inca. They had insight to their everyday lives, and it is through their lens that we learn about religion in the Inca Empire. While the indigenous author Pedro Cieza de León wrote about the effects coca had on the Inca, multiple Spanish men wrote about the importance of coca in their spirituality. For example Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, Father Bernabé Cobo, and Juan de Ulloa Mogollón noted how the Incas would leave coca leaves at important locations throughout the empire. They considered coca to be the highest form of plant offering that the Incas made.

The Incas would put coca leaves in the mouths of mummies, which were a sacred part of Inca culture. Mummies of Inca emperors were regarded for their wisdom and often consulted for important matters long after the body had deteriorated. Not only did many Inca mummies have coca leaves in their mouths, but they also carried coca leaves in bags. These are believed to be Inca sacrifices, and like the Aztecs, the Inca participated in sacrifices as well. It is clear that the Incas had a strong belief in the divinity of the coca leaf as there is now evidence that both the living and the dead were subjected to coca use. They even sent their sacrifices off to their death with a sacrificial bag of coca leaves. The coca leaf affected all stages of life for the Inca. Coca was also used in divination as ritual priests would burn a mixture of coca and llama fat and predict the future based on the appearance of the flame.

===Coca use after the Spanish invasion and colonization===
After the Spanish invasion and colonization of the Inca Empire, the use of coca was restricted and appropriated by the Spaniards. By many historical accounts, the Spaniards tried to eradicate the coca leaf from Inca life. The Spaniards enslaved Inca people and tried to prevent them from having &quot;the luxury&quot; of the coca leaf. Although the Spaniards noticed the state-controlled storage facilities that the Inca had built to distribute to its workers, they were still ignorant to plant spirit, divinity of coca, and the Incan admittance of the former. &quot;This is my blood, this is my body&quot; remembrance now was overshadowed by gates of behavior meeting efforts of worker control and service within work to spread concepts within outreach to support divinity and rights of the divine to exist in the divine&#x27;s works. Not only that, enslaved Inca people were not capable of enduring the arduous labour the Spaniards made them do without using coca. Even though Spaniards were trying to push Catholicism onto the Inca, which did not allow them to eat before the Eucharist (the Spaniards thought coca to be food), they allowed them to continue to use coca to endure the labor associated with slavery. After seeing the effects and powers of the coca plant, many Spaniards saw another opportunity and started growing and selling coca themselves.

== Traditional uses ==

=== Medicine ===
Traditional medical uses of coca are foremost as a stimulant to overcome fatigue, hunger, and thirst. It is considered particularly effective against altitude sickness. It also is used as an anesthetic and analgesic to alleviate the pain of headache, rheumatism, wounds and sores, etc. Before stronger anaesthetics were available, it also was used for broken bones, childbirth, and during trepanning operations on the skull. The high calcium content in coca explains why people used it for bone fractures. Because coca constricts blood vessels, it also serves to oppose bleeding, and coca seeds were used for nosebleeds. Indigenous use of coca has also been reported as a treatment for malaria, ulcers, asthma, to improve digestion, to guard against bowel laxity, as an aphrodisiac, and credited with improving longevity. Modern studies have supported a number of these medical applications.

=== Nutrition ===
Raw coca leaves, chewed or consumed as tea or mate de coca, are rich in nutritional properties. Specifically, the coca plant contains essential minerals (calcium, potassium, phosphorus), vitamins (B1, B2, C, and E) and nutrients such as protein and fiber.

=== Religion ===
Coca has also been a vital part of the religious cosmology of the Andean peoples of Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and northwest Argentina from the pre-Inca period through to the present. Coca leaves play a crucial part in offerings to the apus (mountains), Inti (the sun), or Pachamama (the earth). Coca leaves are also often read in a form of divination analogous to reading tea leaves in other cultures. As one example of the many traditional beliefs about coca, it is believed by the miners of Cerro de Pasco to soften the veins of ore, if masticated (chewed) and thrown upon them (see Cocamama in Inca mythology). In addition, coca use in shamanic rituals is well documented wherever local native populations have cultivated the plant. For example, the Tayronas of Colombia&#x27;s Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta would chew the plant before engaging in extended meditation and prayer.

==== Chewing ====

In Bolivia bags of coca leaves are sold in local markets and by street vendors. The activity of chewing coca is called &quot;mambear&quot;, &quot;chacchar&quot; or &quot;acullicar&quot;, borrowed from Quechua, &quot;coquear&quot; (Northwest Argentina), or in Bolivia, &quot;picchar&quot;, derived from the Aymara language. The Spanish &quot;masticar&quot; is also frequently used, along with the slang term &quot;bolear,&quot; derived from the word &quot;bola&quot; or ball of coca pouched in the cheek while chewing. Typical coca consumption varies between 20 and 60 grams per day, and contemporary methods are believed to be unchanged from ancient times. Coca is kept in a woven pouch (&quot;chuspa&quot; or &quot;huallqui&quot;). A few leaves are chosen to form a quid &quot;(acullico)&quot; held between the mouth and gums. Doing so may cause a tingling and numbing sensation in the mouth, in similar fashion to the formerly ubiquitous dental anaesthetic novocaine (as both cocaine and novocaine belong to the amino ester class of local anesthetics).

Chewing coca leaves is most common in indigenous communities across the central Andean region, particularly in places like the highlands of Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, where the cultivation and consumption of coca is a part of the national culture, similar to chicha. It also serves as a powerful symbol of indigenous cultural and religious identity, amongst a diversity of indigenous nations throughout South America. Chewing plants for medicinal mostly stimulating effects has a long history throughout the world: Khat in East Africa &amp; the Arabian Peninsula, Tobacco in North America and Australia, and Areca nut in South/Southeast Asia &amp; the Pacific Basin. Tobacco leaves were also traditionally chewed in the same way in North America (modern chewing tobacco is typically heavily processed). Khat chewing also has a history as a social custom dating back thousands of years analogous to the use of coca leaves.
One option for chewing coca is with a tiny quantity of &quot;ilucta&quot; (a preparation of the ashes of the quinoa plant) added to the coca leaves; it softens their astringent flavor and activates the alkaloids. Other names for this basifying substance are &quot;llipta&quot; in Peru and the Spanish word &quot;lejía&quot;, &quot;bleach&quot; in English. The consumer carefully uses a wooden stick (formerly often a spatula of precious metal) to transfer an alkaline component into the quid without touching his flesh with the corrosive substance. The alkali component, usually kept in a gourd (&quot;ishcupuro&quot; or &quot;poporo&quot;), can be made by burning limestone to form unslaked quicklime, burning quinoa stalks, or the bark from certain trees, and may be called &quot;llipta&quot;, &quot;tocra&quot; or &quot;mambe&quot; depending on its composition. Many of these materials are salty in flavor, but there are variations. The most common base in the La Paz area of Bolivia is a product known as &quot;lejía dulce&quot; (&quot;sweet lye&quot;), which is made from quinoa ashes mixed with aniseed and cane sugar, forming a soft black putty with a sweet and pleasing flavor. In some places, baking soda is used under the name &quot;bico&quot;.

In the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, on the Caribbean Coast of Colombia, coca is consumed by the Kogi, Arhuaco, and Wiwa by using a special device called poporo. The poporo is the mark of manhood; it is regarded by men as a good companion that means &quot;food&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;, and &quot;meditation&quot;. When a boy is ready to be married, his mother initiates him in the use of the coca. This act of initiation is carefully supervised by the Mamo, a traditional priest-teacher-leader.

Fresh samples of the dried leaves, uncurled, are a deep green colour on the upper surface, and a grey-green on the lower surface, and have a strong tea-like aroma. When chewed, they produce a pleasurable numbness in the mouth, and have a pleasant, pungent taste. They are traditionally chewed with lime or some other reagent such as bicarbonate of soda to increase the release of the active ingredients from the leaf. Older species have a camphoraceous smell and a brownish color, and lack the pungent taste. See also &quot;Erythroxylum coca, and Erythroxylum novogranatense&quot; spp.

Ypadú is an unrefined, unconcentrated powder made from coca leaves and the ash of various other plants.

==== Tea ====
Although coca leaf chewing is common only among the indigenous populations, the consumption of coca tea (&quot;Mate de coca&quot;) is common among all sectors of society in the Andean countries, especially due to their high elevations from sea level, and is widely held to be beneficial to health, mood, and energy. Coca leaf is sold packaged into teabags in most grocery stores in the region, and establishments that cater to tourists generally feature coca tea. Coca tea is legal in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Ecuador.

== Commercial and industrial uses ==

In the Andes, commercially manufactured coca teas, granola bars, cookies, hard candies, etc. are available in most stores and supermarkets, including upscale suburban supermarkets.

Coca is used industrially in the cosmetics and food industries. A decocainized extract of coca leaf is one of the flavoring ingredients in Coca-Cola. Before the criminalization of cocaine, however, the extract was not decocainized, and hence Coca-Cola&#x27;s original formula did indeed include cocaine.

Coca tea is produced industrially from coca leaves in South America by a number of companies, including Enaco S.A. (National Company of the Coca), a government enterprise in Peru. Coca leaves are also found in a brand of herbal liqueur called &quot;Agwa de Bolivia&quot; (grown in Bolivia and de-cocainized in Amsterdam), and a natural flavouring ingredient in Red Bull Cola, that was launched in March 2008.

=== New markets ===
Coca has figured more prominently in the politics of Bolivia and Peru in the early 21st century. President Morales asserted that &quot;la coca no es cocaína&quot;—the coca leaf is not cocaine. During his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 19, 2006, he held a coca leaf in his hand to demonstrate its innocuity.

Alan García, former president of Peru, has recommended its use in salads and other edible preparations. A Peruvian-based company has announced plans to market a modern version of Vin Mariani, which will be available in both natural and de-cocainized varieties.

In Venezuela, former president Hugo Chávez said in a speech in January 2008 that he chews coca every day, and that his &quot;hook up&quot; is Bolivian president Evo Morales. Chávez reportedly said &quot;I chew coca every day in the morning... and look how I am&quot; before showing his biceps to his audience, the Venezuelan National Assembly.

On the other hand, the Colombian government has recently moved in the opposite direction. For years, Bogotá has allowed indigenous coca farmers to sell coca products, promoting the enterprise as one of the few successful commercial opportunities available to recognized tribes like the Nasa, who have grown it for years and regard it as sacred. In December 2005, the Paeces – a Tierradentro (Cauca) indigenous community – started to produce a carbonated soft drink called &quot;Coca Sek&quot;. The production method belongs to the resguardos of Calderas (Inzá) and takes about of coca per 3,000 produced bottles. The drink was never sold widely in Colombia and efforts to do so ended in May 2007 when it was abruptly banned by the Colombian government.

Coca Colla is an energy drink which is produced in Bolivia with the use of coca extract as its base. It was launched on the Bolivian markets in La Paz, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba in mid-April 2010.

== Literary references ==

Probably the earliest reference to coca in English literature is in &quot;Pomona&quot;, the fifth book of Abraham Cowley&#x27;s posthumously published Latin work, &quot;Plantarum libri sex&quot; (1668; translated as &quot;Six Books of Plants&quot; in 1689). In the series of Aubrey–Maturin novels by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, set during the Napoleonic wars, Dr. Stephen Maturin, a naval physician, naturalist, and British intelligence agent discovers the use of coca leaves on a mission to Peru, and makes regular use of them in several of the later novels in the series.

== International prohibition of coca leaf ==
Coca leaf is the raw material for the manufacture of the drug cocaine, a powerful stimulant and anaesthetic extracted chemically from large quantities of coca leaves. Today, since it has mostly been replaced as a medical anaesthetic by synthetic analogues such as procaine, cocaine is best known as an illegal recreational drug. The cultivation, sale, and possession of unprocessed coca leaf (but not of any processed form of cocaine) is generally legal in the countries – such as Bolivia, Peru, Chile, and Argentine Northwest – where traditional use is established, although cultivation is often restricted in an attempt to control the production of cocaine. 
In the case of Argentina, it is legal only in some northwest provinces where the practice is so common that the state has accepted it.

The prohibition of the use of the coca leaf except for medical or scientific purposes was established by the United Nations in the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The coca leaf is listed on Schedule I of the 1961 Single Convention together with cocaine and heroin. The Convention determined that &quot;The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated&quot; (Article 26), and that, &quot;Coca leaf chewing must be abolished within twenty-five years from the coming into force of this Convention&quot; (Article 49, 2.e).

The historic rationale for international prohibition of coca leaf in the 1961 Single Convention comes from &quot;The Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf study&quot; published in 1950. It was requested of the United Nations by the permanent representative of Peru, and was prepared by a commission that visited Bolivia and Peru briefly in 1949 to &quot;investigate the effects of chewing the coca leaf and the possibilities of limiting its production and controlling its distribution.&quot; It concluded that the effects of chewing coca leaves were negative, even though chewing coca was defined as a habit, not an addiction.

The report was sharply criticised for its arbitrariness, lack of precision, and racist connotations. The team members&#x27; professional qualifications and parallel interests were also criticised, as were the methodology used and the incomplete selection and use of existing scientific literature on the coca leaf. Questions have been raised as to whether a similar study today would pass the scrutiny and critical review to which scientific studies are routinely subjected.

Despite the legal restriction among countries party to the international treaty, coca chewing and drinking of coca tea is carried out daily by millions of people in the Andes as well as considered sacred within indigenous cultures. Coca consumers claim that most of the information provided about the traditional use of the coca leaf and its modern adaptations is erroneous. This has made it impossible to shed light on the plant&#x27;s positive aspects and its potential benefits for the physical, mental, and social health of the people who consume and cultivate it.

In an attempt to obtain international acceptance for the legal recognition of traditional use of coca in their respective countries, Peru and Bolivia successfully led an amendment, paragraph 2 of Article 14 into the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, stipulating that measures to eradicate illicit cultivation and to eliminate illicit demand &quot;should take due account of traditional licit use, where there is historic evidence of such use.&quot; Bolivia also made a formal reservation to the 1988 Convention, which required countries to adopt measures to establish the use, consumption, possession, purchase or cultivation of the coca leaf for personal consumption as a criminal offence. Bolivia stated that &quot;the coca leaf is not, in and of itself, a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance&quot; and stressed that its &quot;legal system recognizes the ancestral nature of the licit use of the coca leaf, which, for much of Bolivia&#x27;s population, dates back over centuries.&quot;

However, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) – the independent and quasi-judicial control organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug conventions – denied the validity of article 14 in the 1988 Convention over the requirements of the 1961 Convention, or any reservation made by parties, since it does not &quot;absolve a party of its rights and obligations under the other international drug control treaties.&quot;

The INCB stated in its 1994 Annual Report that &quot;mate de coca, which is considered harmless and legal in several countries in South America, is an illegal activity under the provisions of both the 1961 Convention and the 1988 Convention, though that was not the intention of the plenipotentiary conferences that adopted those conventions.&quot; It implicitly also dismissed the original report of the Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf by recognizing that &quot;there is a need to undertake a scientific review to assess the coca-chewing habit and the drinking of coca tea.&quot;

Nevertheless, the INCB on other occasions did not show signs of an increased sensitivity towards the Bolivian claim on the rights of their indigenous population, and the general public, to consume the coca leaf in a traditional manner by chewing the leaf, and drinking coca tea, as &quot;not in line with the provisions of the 1961 Convention.&quot; The Board considered Bolivia, Peru and a few other countries that allow such practises to be in breach with their treaty obligations, and insisted that &quot;each party to the Convention should establish as a criminal offence, when committed intentionally, the possession and purchase of coca leaf for personal consumption.&quot;

In reaction to the 2007 Annual Report of the INCB, the Bolivian government announced that it would formally issue a request to the United Nations to unschedule the coca leaf of List 1 of the 1961 UN Single Convention. Bolivia led a diplomatic effort to do so beginning in March 2009, but eighteen countries out of a total of 184, those 18 being, listed chronologically: the United States, Sweden, United Kingdom, Latvia, Japan, Canada, France, Germany, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Mexico, Russian Federation, Malaysia, Singapore, and Ukraine, objected to the change before the January 2011 deadline. A single objection would have been sufficient to block the modification. The legally unnecessary step of supporting the change was taken formally by Spain, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Costa Rica. In June 2011, Bolivia moved to denounce the 1961 Convention over the prohibition of the coca leaf.

At Bolivia’s initiative, organized by Colombia and Bolivia with the support of Canada, Czechia, Malta, Mexico, Switzerland and OHCHR, the World Health Organization (WHO), is conducting a ‘critical review’ of the coca leaf. In 2025, based on its findings, the WHO may recommend changes in coca’s classification under the UN drug control treaties. 

Since the 1980s, the countries in which coca is grown have come under political and economic pressure from the United States to restrict the cultivation of the crop in order to reduce the supply of cocaine on the international market.

 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs requires nations that allow the cultivation of coca to designate an agency to regulate said cultivation and take physical possession of the crops as soon as possible after harvest, and to destroy all coca which grows wild or is illegally cultivated. The effort to enforce these provisions, referred to as coca eradication, has involved many strategies, ranging from aerial spraying of herbicides on coca crops to assistance and incentives to encourage farmers to grow alternative crops.

This effort has been politically controversial, with proponents claiming that the production of cocaine is several times the amount needed to satisfy legal demand and inferring that the vast majority of the coca crop is destined for the illegal market. As per the proclaimed view, this not only contributes to the major social problem of drug abuse but also financially supports insurgent groups that collaborate with drug traffickers in some cocaine-producing territories. Critics of the effort claim that it creates hardship primarily for the coca growers, many of whom are poor and have no viable alternative way to make a living, causes environmental problems, that it is not effective in reducing the supply of cocaine, in part because cultivation can move to other areas, and that any social harm created by drug abuse is only made worse by the War on Drugs. The environmental problems include &quot;ecocide&quot;, where vast tracts of land and forest are sprayed with glyphosate or Roundup, with the intention of eradicating the coca plant. However, the incidental environmental damage is severe, because many plant species are wiped out in the process.

Coca has been reintroduced to the United States as a flavoring agent in the herbal liqueur Agwa de Bolivia.

Boliviana negra, a genetically engineered type of coca, resists glyphosate herbicides and increases yields.

== Legal status ==

The primary organization authorized to purchase coca leaves is ENACO S.A., headquartered in Peru. Outside of South America, most countries&#x27; laws make no distinction between the coca leaf and any other substance containing cocaine, so the possession of coca leaf is prohibited. In South America coca leaf is illegal in both Paraguay and Brazil.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, coca leaf is legally in the same category as cocaine, as both are List I drugs of the Opium Law. The Opium Law specifically mentions the leaves of the plants of the genus &quot;Erythroxylon&quot;. However, the possession of living plants of the genus &quot;Erythroxylon&quot; is not actively prosecuted, even though they are legally forbidden.

===United States===
Like cocaine, coca is controlled under the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) as a Schedule II drug meaning it is a restricted drug and is illegal to process without a prescription or a DEA registration.

In the United States, a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey is a registered importer of coca leaf. The company manufactures pure cocaine for medical use and also produces a cocaine-free extract of the coca leaf, which is used as a flavoring ingredient in Coca-Cola. Other companies that have registrations with the DEA to import coca leaf according to 2011 Federal Register Notices for Importers, include Johnson Matthey, Inc, Pharmaceutical Materials; Mallinckrodt Inc; Penick Corporation; and the Research Triangle Institute. Analysts have noted the substantial importation of coca leaf into the United States, but the actual quantity is unknown because much of it is illegally imported, and there are many reports of coca leaves and coca teas being sold in the United States and being seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration throughout the States and Territories of the United States.

===Canada===
Coca leaf is listed as a Schedule I drug (most dangerous) according to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act of Canada (S.C. 1996, c. 19) alongside Opium (Heroin) and synthetic opioid analgesics. Specifically, it lists Coca (Erythroxylon), its preparations, derivatives, alkaloids, and salts, including:(1) Coca leaves (2) Cocaine and (3) Ecgonine. Possession of a Schedule I substance is illegal and trafficking can result in punishment of up to life imprisonment.

===Australia===
Coca leaf is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

===India===
Coca leaf is a controlled narcotic drug in India by the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 which is the principal legislation governing the subject. While its scientific and medical purposes are permissible in accordance with law, any other indulgence including cultivation, possession, sale, consumption, transportation, import, export, are prohibited.

<text>Tangloids is a mathematical game for two players created by Piet Hein to model the calculus of spinors.
A description of the game appeared in the book &quot;Martin Gardner&#x27;s New Mathematical Diversions from Scientific American&quot; by Martin Gardner from 1996 in a section on the mathematics of braiding.

Two flat blocks of wood each pierced with three small holes are joined with three parallel strings. Each player holds one of the blocks of wood. The first player holds one block of wood still, while the other player rotates the other block of wood for two full revolutions. The plane of rotation is perpendicular to the strings when not tangled. The strings now overlap each other. Then the first player tries to untangle the strings without rotating either piece of wood. Only translations (moving the pieces without rotating) are allowed. Afterwards, the players reverse roles; whoever can untangle the strings fastest is the winner. Try it with only one revolution. The strings are of course overlapping again but they can not be untangled without rotating one of the two wooden blocks.

The Balinese cup trick, appearing in the Balinese candle dance, is a different illustration of the same mathematical idea. The anti-twister mechanism is a device intended to avoid such orientation entanglements. A mathematical interpretation of these ideas can be found in the article on quaternions and spatial rotation.

==Mathematical articulation==
This game serves to clarify the notion that rotations in space have properties that cannot be intuitively explained by considering only the rotation of a single rigid object in space. The rotation of vectors does not encompass all of the properties of the abstract model of rotations given by the rotation group. The property being illustrated in this game is formally referred to in mathematics as the &quot;&quot;double covering of SO(3) by SU(2)&quot;.&quot; This abstract concept can be roughly sketched as follows. 

Rotations in three dimensions can be expressed as 3x3 matrices, a block of numbers, one each for x,y,z. If one considers arbitrarily tiny rotations, one is led to the conclusion that rotations form a space, in that if each rotation is thought of as a point, then there are always other nearby points, other nearby rotations that differ by only a small amount. In small neighborhoods, this collection of nearby points resembles Euclidean space. In fact, it resembles three-dimensional Euclidean space, as there are three different possible directions for infinitesimal rotations: x, y and z. This properly describes the structure of the rotation group in small neighborhoods. For sequences of large rotations, however, this model breaks down; for example, turning right and then lying down is not the same as lying down first and then turning right. Although the rotation group has the structure of 3D space on the small scale, that is not its structure on the large scale. Systems that behave like Euclidean space on the small scale, but possibly have a more complicated global structure are called manifolds. Famous examples of manifolds include the spheres: globally, they are round, but locally, they feel and look flat, ergo &quot;flat Earth&quot;. 

Careful examination of the rotation group reveals that it has the structure of a 3-sphere formula_1 with opposite points identified. That means that for every rotation, there are in fact two different, distinct, polar opposite points on the 3-sphere that describe that rotation. This is what the tangloids illustrate. The illustration is actually quite clever. Imagine performing the 360 degree rotation one degree at a time, as a set of tiny steps. These steps take you on a path, on a journey on this abstract manifold, this abstract space of rotations. At the completion of this 360 degree journey, one has not arrived back home, but rather instead at the polar opposite point. And one is stuck there -- one can&#x27;t actually get back to where one started until one makes another, a second journey of 360 degrees. 

The structure of this abstract space, of a 3-sphere with polar opposites identified, is quite weird. Technically, it is a projective space. One can try to imagine taking a balloon, letting all the air out, then gluing together polar opposite points. If attempted in real life, one soon discovers it can&#x27;t be done globally. Locally, for any small patch, one can accomplish the flip-and-glue steps; one just can&#x27;t do this globally. (Keep in mind that the balloon is formula_2, the 2-sphere; it&#x27;s not the 3-sphere of rotations.) To further simplify, one can start with formula_3, the circle, and attempt to glue together polar opposites; one still gets a failed mess. The best one can do is to draw straight lines through the origin, and then declare, by fiat, that the polar opposites are the same point. This is the basic construction of any projective space.

The so-called &quot;double covering&quot; refers to the idea that this gluing-together of polar opposites can be undone. This can be explained relatively simply, although it does require the introduction of some mathematical notation. The first step is to blurt out &quot;Lie algebra&quot;. This is a vector space endowed with the property that two vectors can be multiplied. This arises because a tiny rotation about the &quot;x&quot;-axis followed by a tiny rotation about the &quot;y&quot;-axis is not the same as reversing the order of these two; they are different, and the difference is a tiny rotation in along the &quot;z&quot;-axis. Formally, this inequivalence can be written as formula_4, keeping in mind that &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; are not numbers but infinitesimal rotations. They don&#x27;t commute. 

One may then ask, &quot;what else behaves like this?&quot; Well, obviously the 3D rotation matrices do; after all, the whole point is that they do correctly, perfectly mathematically describe rotations in 3D space. As it happens, though, there are also 2x2, 4x4, 5x5, ... matrices that also have this property. One may reasonably ask &quot;OK, so what is the shape of &quot;their&quot; manifolds?&quot;. For the 2x2 case, the Lie algebra is called su(2) and the manifold is called SU(2), and quite curiously, the manifold of SU(2) is the 3-sphere (but without the projective identification of polar opposites). 

This now allows one to play a bit of a trick. Take a vector formula_5 in ordinary 3D space (our physical space) and apply a rotation matrix formula_6 to it. One obtains a rotated vector formula_7. This is the result of applying an ordinary, &quot;common sense&quot; rotation to formula_8. But one also has the Pauli matrices formula_9; these are 2x2 complex matrices that have the Lie algebra property that formula_10 and so these model the formula_4 behavior of infinitesimal rotations. Consider then the product formula_12. The &quot;double covering&quot; is the property that there exists not one, but two 2x2 matrices formula_13 such that

:formula_14

Here, formula_15 denotes the inverse of formula_13; that is, formula_17 The matrix formula_13 is an element of SU(2), and so for every matrix formula_6 in SO(3), there are two corresponding formula_13: both formula_21 and formula_22 will do the trick. These two are the polar-opposites, and the projection is just boils down to the trivial observation that formula_23 The tangeloid game is meant to illustrate that a 360 degree rotation takes one on a path from formula_21 to formula_22. This is quite precise: one can consider a sequence of small rotations formula_6 and the corresponding movement of formula_13; the result does change sign. In terms of rotation angles formula_28 the formula_6 matrix will have a formula_30 in it, but the matching formula_13 will have a formula_32 in it. Further elucidation requires actually writing out these formulas.

The sketch can be completed with some general remarks. First, Lie algebras are generic, and for each one, there are one or more corresponding Lie groups. In physics, 3D rotations of normal 3D objects are obviously described by the rotation group, which is a Lie group of 3x3 matrices formula_6. However, the spinors, the spin-1/2 particles, rotate according to the matrices formula_13 in SU(2). The 4x4 matrices describe the rotation of spin-3/2 particles, and the 5x5 matrices describe the rotations of spin-2 particles, and so on. The representation of Lie groups and Lie algebras are described by representation theory. The spin-1/2 representation belongs to the fundamental representation, and the spin-1 is the adjoint representation. The notion of double-covering used here is a generic phenomenon, described by covering maps. Covering maps are in turn a special case of fiber bundles. The classification of covering maps is done via homotopy theory; in this case, the formal expression of double-covering is to say that the fundamental group is formula_35 where the covering group formula_36 is just encoding the two equivalent rotations formula_21 and formula_22 above. In this sense, the rotation group provides the doorway, the key to the kingdom of vast tracts of higher mathematics.

<text>John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster (6 March 1340 – 3 February 1399), was an English royal prince, military leader and statesman. He was the fourth son (third surviving) of King Edward III of England, and the father of King Henry IV. Because of Gaunt&#x27;s royal origin, advantageous marriages and some generous land grants, he was one of the richest men of his era and an influential figure during the reigns of both his father and his nephew, Richard II. As Duke of Lancaster, he is the founder of the royal House of Lancaster, whose members would ascend the throne after his death. His birthplace, Ghent in Flanders, then known in English as &quot;Gaunt&quot;, was the origin of his name. 

John&#x27;s early career was spent in France and Spain fighting in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. He made an abortive attempt to enforce a claim to the Crown of Castile that came through his second wife, Constance of Castile, and for a time styled himself as King of Castile. When Edward the Black Prince, Gaunt&#x27;s elder brother and heir-apparent to the ageing Edward III, became incapacitated owing to poor health, Gaunt assumed control of many government functions and rose to become one of the most powerful political figures in England. He was faced with military difficulties abroad and political divisions at home, and disagreements as to how to deal with these crises led to tensions between Gaunt, the English Parliament and the ruling class, making him an unpopular figure for a time.

John exercised great influence over the English throne during the minority of King Richard II (Edward the Black Prince&#x27;s son) and the ensuing periods of political strife. He mediated between the king and a group of rebellious nobles, which included Gaunt&#x27;s own son and heir-apparent, Henry Bolingbroke. Following Gaunt&#x27;s death in 1399, his estates and titles were declared forfeit to the Crown, and his son Bolingbroke, now disinherited, was branded a traitor and exiled. Henry returned from exile shortly after to reclaim his inheritance and depose Richard. He reigned as King Henry IV of England (1399–1413), the first of the descendants of John of Gaunt to hold the English throne.

All English monarchs from Henry IV onwards are descended from John of Gaunt. His direct male line, the House of Lancaster, would rule England from 1399 until the time of the Wars of the Roses. Gaunt is also generally believed to have fathered five children outside marriage: one early in life by a lady-in-waiting to his mother; the others, surnamed Beaufort, by Katherine Swynford, his long-term mistress and third wife. They were later legitimised by royal and papal decrees, but this did not affect Henry IV&#x27;s bar to their having a place in the line of succession. Through his daughter Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, he was an ancestor of the Yorkist kings Edward IV, Edward V and Richard III. Through his great-granddaughter Lady Margaret Beaufort he was also an ancestor of Henry VII, who married Edward IV&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth of York, and all subsequent monarchs are descendants of their marriage. Two of John&#x27;s daughters married into continental royal houses (those of Portugal and Castile). Through them, many royal families of Europe can trace lineage to him.

==Early life==

John was the son of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault, and was born in Ghent in Flanders, most likely at Saint Bavo&#x27;s Abbey, in March 1340. The name by which he has become best known, &quot;of Gaunt&quot;, was derived from an anglicised form of his birthplace, Ghent. Its use was popularised by Shakespeare in his play &quot;Richard II&quot;. However, during John&#x27;s lifetime, he was not referred to as this after the age of three. When he became unpopular later in life, a scurrilous rumour circulated, along with lampoons, claiming that he was actually the son of a Ghent butcher. This rumour, which infuriated him, might have been inspired by the fact that Edward III had not been present at his birth.

John&#x27;s first wife, Blanche of Lancaster, was also his third cousin; both were great-great-grandchildren of King Henry III. They married in 1359 at Reading Abbey as a part of the efforts of Edward III to arrange matches for his sons with wealthy heiresses. Upon the death of his father-in-law, the Duke of Lancaster, in 1361, John received half his lands, the title &quot;Earl of Lancaster&quot;, and distinction as the greatest landowner in Northern England as heir of the Palatinate of Lancaster. He also became the 14th Baron of Halton and 11th Lord of Bowland. John inherited the rest of the Lancaster property when Blanche&#x27;s sister Maud, Countess of Leicester (married to William V, Count of Hainaut), died without issue on 10 April 1362.
John received the title &quot;Duke of Lancaster&quot; from his father on 13 November 1362. By then well established, he owned at least thirty castles and estates across England and France and maintained a household comparable in scale and organisation to that of a monarch. He owned land in almost every county in England, a patrimony that produced a net income of between £8,000 and £10,000 a year, equivalent in 2023 to c.£170 – 213 million in income value, or £3.5 – 4.4 billion in relation to gdp.

==Military commander==
Because of his rank, John of Gaunt was one of England&#x27;s principal military commanders in the 1370s and 1380s, though his enterprises were never rewarded with the kind of dazzling success that had made his elder brother Edward the Black Prince such a charismatic war leader.

=== War in France ===
On the resumption of war with France in 1369, John was sent to Calais with Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and a small English army with which he raided into northern France. On 23 August, he was confronted by a much larger French army under Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Exercising his first command, John dared not attack such a superior force and the two armies faced each other across a marsh for several weeks until the English were reinforced by the Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, at which the French withdrew without offering battle. John and Warwick then decided to strike Harfleur, the base of the French fleet on the Seine. Further reinforced by German mercenaries, they marched on Harfleur, but were delayed by French guerilla operations while the town prepared for a siege. John invested the town for four days in October, but he was losing so many men to dysentery and bubonic plague that he decided to abandon the siege and return to Calais. During this retreat, the army had to fight its way across the Somme at the ford of Blanchetaque against a French army led by Hugh de Châtillon, who was captured and sold to Edward III. By the middle of November, the survivors of the sickly army returned to Calais, where the Earl of Warwick died of the plague. Though it seemed an inglorious conclusion to the campaign, John had forced the French king, Charles V, to abandon his plans to invade England that autumn.

In the summer of 1370, John was sent with a small army to Aquitaine to reinforce his ailing elder brother, the Black Prince, and his younger brother Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, Earl of Cambridge. With them, he participated in the Siege of Limoges (September 1370). He took charge of the siege operations and at one point engaged in hand-to-hand fighting in the undermining tunnels. After this event, the Black Prince gave John the lieutenancy of Aquitaine and sailed for England, leaving John in charge. Though he attempted to defend the duchy against French encroachment for nearly a year, lack of resources and money meant he could do little but husband what small territory the English still controlled, and he resigned the command in September 1371 and returned to England. Just before leaving Aquitaine, he married the Infanta Constance of Castile in September 1371 at Roquefort, near Bordeaux, Guyenne. The following year he took part with his father, Edward III, in an abortive attempt to invade France with a large army, which was frustrated by three months of unfavourable winds.

Probably John&#x27;s most notable feat of arms occurred in August–December 1373, when he attempted to relieve Aquitaine by the landward route, leading an army of some 9,000 mounted men from Calais on a great chevauchée from north-eastern to south-western France on a 900-kilometre raid. This four-month ride through enemy territory, evading French armies on the way, was a bold stroke that impressed contemporaries but achieved virtually nothing. Beset on all sides by French ambushes and plagued by disease and starvation, John of Gaunt and his raiders battled their way through Champagne, east of Paris, into Burgundy, across the Massif Central, and finally down into Dordogne. Unable to attack any strongly fortified forts and cities, the raiders plundered the countryside, which weakened the French infrastructure, but the military value of the damage was only temporary. Marching in winter across the Limousin plateau, with stragglers being picked off by the French, huge numbers of the army, and even larger numbers of horses, died of cold, disease or starvation. The army reached English-occupied Bordeaux on 24 December 1373, severely weakened in numbers with the loss of at least one-third of their force in action and another third to disease. Upon arrival in Bordeaux, many more succumbed to the bubonic plague that was raging in the city. Sick, demoralised and mutinous, the army was in no shape to defend Aquitaine, and soldiers began to desert. John had no funds with which to pay them, and despite his entreaties, none were sent from England, so in April 1374, he abandoned the enterprise and sailed for home.

John&#x27;s final campaign in France took place in 1378. He planned a &#x27;great expedition&#x27; of mounted men in a large armada of ships to land at Brest and take control of Brittany. Not enough ships could be found to transport the horses, and the expedition was tasked with the more limited objective of capturing St. Malo. The English destroyed the shipping in St. Malo harbour and began to assault the town by land on 14 August, but John was soon hampered by the size of his army, which was unable to forage because French armies under Olivier de Clisson and Bertrand du Guesclin occupied the surrounding countryside, harrying the edges of his force. In September, the siege was simply abandoned and the army returned ingloriously to England. John of Gaunt received most of the blame for the debâcle.

Partly as a result of these failures, and those of other English commanders at this period, John was one of the first important figures in England to conclude that the war with France was unwinnable because of France&#x27;s greater resources of wealth and manpower. He began to advocate peace negotiations; indeed, as early as 1373, during his great raid through France, he made contact with Guillaume Roger, brother and political adviser of Pope Gregory XI, to let the pope know he would be interested in a diplomatic conference under papal auspices. This approach led indirectly to the Anglo-French Congress of Bruges in 1374–77, which resulted in the short-lived Truce of Bruges between the two sides. John was himself a delegate to the various conferences that eventually resulted in the Truce of Leulinghem in 1389. The fact that he became identified with the attempts to make peace added to his unpopularity at a period when the majority of Englishmen believed victory would be in their grasp if only the French could be defeated decisively as they had been in the 1350s. Another motive was John&#x27;s conviction that it was only by making peace with France would it be possible to release sufficient manpower to enforce his claim to the throne of Castile.

== Succession to the throne ==

After the death in 1376 of his older brother Edward of Woodstock (also known as the &quot;Black Prince&quot;), John of Gaunt contrived to protect the religious reformer John Wycliffe, possibly to counteract the growing secular power of the church. However, John&#x27;s ascendancy to political power coincided with widespread resentment of his influence. At a time when English forces encountered setbacks in the Hundred Years&#x27; War against France, and Edward III&#x27;s rule was becoming unpopular owing to high taxation and his affair with Alice Perrers, political opinion closely associated the Duke of Lancaster with the failing government of the 1370s. Furthermore, while King Edward and the Prince of Wales were popular heroes because of their successes on the battlefield, John of Gaunt had not won equivalent military renown that could have bolstered his reputation. Although he fought in the Battle of Nájera (1367), for example, his later military projects proved unsuccessful.

When Edward III died in 1377 and John&#x27;s ten-year-old nephew succeeded as Richard II of England, John&#x27;s influence strengthened. However, mistrust remained, and some suspected him of wanting to seize the throne himself. John took pains to ensure that he never became associated with the opposition to Richard&#x27;s kingship. As &quot;de facto&quot; ruler during Richard&#x27;s minority, he made unwise decisions on taxation that led to the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381, when the rebels destroyed his home in London, the Savoy Palace. Unlike some of Richard&#x27;s unpopular advisors, John was away from London at the time of the uprising and thus avoided the direct wrath of the rebels.

In 1386 John left England to seek the throne of Castile, claimed in &quot;jure uxoris&quot; by right of his second wife, Constance of Castile, whom he had married in 1371. However, crisis ensued almost immediately in his absence, and in 1387 King Richard&#x27;s misrule brought England to the brink of civil war. John had to give up on his ambitions in Spain and hurry back to England in 1389. Only John&#x27;s intervention in the political crisis succeeded in persuading the Lords Appellant and King Richard to compromise to usher in a period of relative stability. During the 1390s, John&#x27;s reputation of devotion to the well-being of the kingdom was largely restored.

== Marriages and family ==
John was married three times. His first wife, Blanche of Lancaster, was also his third cousin; both were great-great-grandchildren of King Henry III. They married in 1359 at Reading Abbey. They had seven children; only three survived to adulthood.

After Blanche&#x27;s death in 1368, shortly after the birth of her last child, John married, in 1371, Infanta Constance of Castile, daughter of King Peter of Castile, giving him a claim to the Crown of Castile. They had one daughter. Constance died in 1394.

During his second marriage, some time around 1373 (the approximate birth year of their eldest son, John Beaufort) John of Gaunt entered into an extra-marital love affair with Katherine Swynford (born de Roet), the daughter of an ordinary knight (Sir Paon de Roet), which would produce four children for the couple. All of them were born out of wedlock, but were legitimised upon their parents&#x27; eventual marriage. The adulterous relationship endured until 1381, when it was ended out of political necessity.

On 13 January 1396, two years after the death of Constance of Castile, Katherine and John of Gaunt married in Lincoln Cathedral. Their children were given the surname &quot;Beaufort&quot; after a former French possession of the duke. The Beaufort children, three sons and a daughter, were legitimised by royal and papal decrees after John and Katherine married. A later proviso that they were specifically barred from inheriting the throne—the phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;except royal status&quot;)—was inserted with dubious authority by their half-brother Henry IV. However as historian and author Nathen Amin points out there was no parliamentary ratification of this scribbled in amendment. Further testing and analysis on these three words is required to determine when exactly they were added. There is every possibility they were added as a later proviso during the height of the Wars of the Roses as a means to discredit any heirs of Margaret Beaufort.

== Regent ==
=== Head of government ===
On his return from France in 1374, John took a more decisive and persistent role in the direction of English foreign policy. From then until 1377, he was effectively the head of the English government owing to the illness of his father and elder brother, who were unable to exercise authority. His vast estates made him the richest man in England, and his great wealth, ostentatious display of it, autocratic manner and attitudes, enormous London mansion (the Savoy Palace on the Strand) and association with the failed peace process at Bruges combined to make him the most visible target of social resentments. His time at the head of government was marked by the so-called Good Parliament of 1376 and the Bad Parliament of 1377. The first, called to grant massive war taxation to the Crown, turned into a parliamentary revolution, with the Commons (supported to some extent by the Lords) venting their grievances at decades of crippling taxation, misgovernment, and suspected endemic corruption among the ruling classes. John was left isolated (even the Black Prince supported the need for reform) and the Commons refused to grant money for the war unless most of the great officers of state were dismissed and the king&#x27;s mistress Alice Perrers, another focus of popular resentment, was barred from any further association with him. But even after the government acceded to virtually all their demands, the Commons then refused to authorise any funds for the war, losing the sympathy of the Lords as a result.

The death of the Black Prince on 8 June 1376 and the onset of Edward III&#x27;s last illness at the closing of Parliament on 10 July left John with all the reins of power. He immediately had the ailing king grant pardons to all the officials impeached by the Parliament; Alice Perrers too was reinstated at the heart of the king&#x27;s household. John impeached William of Wykeham and other leaders of the reform movement, and secured their conviction on old or trumped-up charges. The parliament of 1377 was John&#x27;s counter-coup: crucially, the Lords no longer supported the Commons and John was able to have most of the acts of 1376 annulled. He also succeeded in forcing the Commons to agree to the imposition of the first poll tax in English history—a viciously regressive measure that bore hardest on the poorest members of society. There was organised opposition to his measures and rioting in London; John of Gaunt&#x27;s arms were reversed or defaced wherever they were displayed, and protestors pasted up lampoons on his supposedly dubious birth. At one point he was forced to take refuge across the Thames, while his Savoy Palace only just escaped looting. It was rumoured (and believed by many people in England and France) that he intended to seize the throne for himself and supplant the rightful heir, his nephew Richard, the son of the Black Prince, but there seems to have been no truth in this and on the death of Edward III and the accession of the child Richard II, John sought no position of regency for himself and withdrew to his estates.

John&#x27;s personal unpopularity persisted, however, and the failure of his expedition to Saint-Malo in 1378 did nothing for his reputation. By this time, too, some of his possessions were taken from him by the Crown. For example, his ship, the &quot;Dieulagarde&quot;, was seized and bundled with other royal ships to be sold to pay off the debts of Sir Robert de Crull, who during the latter part of King Edward III&#x27;s reign had been the &quot;Clerk of the King&#x27;s Ships&quot;, and had advanced monies to pay for the king&#x27;s ships. During the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, John of Gaunt was far from the centre of events, on the March of Scotland, but he was among those named by the rebels as a traitor to be beheaded as soon as he could be found. The Savoy Palace was systematically destroyed by the mob and burned to the ground. Nominally friendly lords and even his own fortresses closed their gates to him, and John was forced to flee into Scotland with a handful of retainers and throw himself on the charity of King Robert II of Scotland until the crisis was over.

==King of Castile==

Upon his marriage to Constance of Castile in 1371, John assumed (officially from 29 January 1372) the title of King of Castile and León in right of his wife, and insisted his fellow English nobles henceforth address him as &quot;my lord of Spain&quot;. He impaled his arms with those of the Spanish kingdom. From 1372, John gathered around himself a small court of refugee Castilian knights and ladies and set up a Castilian chancery that prepared documents in his name according to the style of Peter of Castile, dated by the Castilian era and signed by himself with the Spanish formula &quot;Yo El Rey&quot; (&quot;I, the King&quot;). He hatched several schemes to make good his claim with an army, but for many years these were still-born owing to lack of finance or the conflicting claims of war in France or with Scotland. 

It was only in 1386, after Portugal under its new King John I had entered into a full alliance with England, that he was actually able to land with an army in Spain and mount a campaign for the throne of Castile (that ultimately failed). John sailed from England on 9 July 1386 with a huge Anglo-Portuguese fleet carrying an army of about 5,000 men plus an extensive &quot;royal&quot; household and his wife and daughters. Pausing on the journey to use his army to drive off the French forces who were then besieging Brest, he landed at Corunna in northern Spain on 29 July.
The Castilian king, John of Trastámara, had expected John would land in Portugal and had concentrated his forces on the Portuguese border. He was wrong-footed by John&#x27;s decision to invade Galicia, the most distant and disaffected of Castile&#x27;s kingdoms. From August to October, John of Gaunt set up a rudimentary court and chancery at Ourense and received the submission of the Galician nobility and most of the towns of Galicia, though they made their homage to him conditional on his being recognised as king by the rest of Castile. While John of Gaunt had gambled on an early decisive battle, the Castilians were in no hurry to join battle, and he began to experience difficulties keeping his army together and paying it. In November, he met King John I of Portugal at Ponte do Mouro on the south side of the Minho river and concluded an agreement with him to make a joint Anglo-Portuguese invasion of central Castile early in 1387. The treaty was sealed by the marriage of John&#x27;s eldest daughter Philippa to the Portuguese king. A large part of John&#x27;s army had succumbed to sickness, however, and when the invasion was mounted, they were far outnumbered by their Portuguese allies. The campaign of April–June 1387 was an ignominious failure. The Castilians refused to offer battle and the Galician-Anglo-Portuguese troops, apart from time-wasting sieges of fortified towns, were reduced to foraging for food in the arid Spanish landscape. They were harried mainly by French mercenaries of the Castilian king. Many hundreds of English, including close friends and retainers of John of Gaunt, died of disease or exhaustion. Many deserted or abandoned the army to ride north under French safe conducts. Shortly after the army returned to Portugal, John of Gaunt concluded a secret treaty with John of Trastámara under which he and his wife renounced all claim to the Castilian throne in return for a large annual payment and the marriage of their daughter Catherine to John of Trastámara&#x27;s son, Henry.

==Duke of Aquitaine==
John left Portugal for Aquitaine, and he remained in that province until he returned to England in November 1389. This effectively kept him off the scene while England endured the major political crisis of the conflict between Richard II and the Lords Appellant, who were led by John of Gaunt&#x27;s younger brother Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester. Only four months after his return to England, in March 1390, Richard II formally invested Gaunt with the Duchy of Aquitaine, thus providing him with the overseas territory he had long desired. However, he did not immediately return to the province, but remained in England and mainly ruled through seneschals as an absentee duke. His administration of the province was a disappointment, and his appointment as duke was much resented by the Gascons, since Aquitaine had previously always been held directly by the king of England or his heir; it was not felt to be a fief that a king could bestow on a subordinate. 

From 1394 through 1395, he was forced to spend nearly a year in Gascony to shore up his position in the face of threats of secession by the Gascon nobles. He was one of England&#x27;s principal negotiators in the diplomatic exchanges with France in 1396, and he initially agreed to join the French-led Crusade that ended in the disastrous Battle of Nicopolis, but withdrew because of ill-health and the political problems in Gascony and England. 

For the remainder of his life, John of Gaunt occupied the role of valued counsellor of the king and loyal supporter of the Crown. He did not even protest, it seems, when his younger brother Thomas was murdered at Richard&#x27;s behest. It may be that he felt he had to maintain this posture of loyalty to protect his son Henry Bolingbroke (the future Henry IV), who had also been one of the Lords Appellant, from Richard&#x27;s wrath; but, in 1398, Richard had Bolingbroke exiled, and on John of Gaunt&#x27;s death the next year he disinherited Bolingbroke completely, seizing John&#x27;s vast estates for the Crown.

==Relationship with Geoffrey Chaucer==
John of Gaunt was a patron and close friend of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, best known for his work &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Near the end of their lives, Lancaster and Chaucer became brothers-in-law. Chaucer married Philippa (Pan) de Roet in 1366, and Lancaster took his mistress of nearly 30 years, Katherine Swynford (de Roet), who was Philippa Chaucer&#x27;s sister, as his third wife in 1396. Although Philippa died , the men were bound as brothers and Lancaster&#x27;s children by Katherine—John, Henry, Thomas and Joan Beaufort—were Chaucer&#x27;s nephews and niece.

Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Duchess&quot;, also known as the &quot;Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse&quot;, was written in commemoration of Blanche of Lancaster, John of Gaunt&#x27;s first wife. The poem refers to John and Blanche in allegory as the narrator relates the tale of &quot;A long castel with walles white/Be Seynt Johan, on a ryche hil&quot; (1318–1319) who is mourning grievously after the death of his love, &quot;And goode faire White she het/That was my lady name ryght&quot; (948–949). The phrase &quot;long castel&quot; is a reference to Lancaster (also called &quot;Loncastel&quot; and &quot;Longcastell&quot;), &quot;walles white&quot; is thought to likely be an oblique reference to Blanche, &quot;Seynt Johan&quot; was John of Gaunt&#x27;s name-saint, and &quot;ryche hil&quot; is a reference to Richmond; these thinly veiled references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. &quot;White&quot; is the English translation of the French word &quot;blanche&quot;, implying that the white lady was Blanche of Lancaster.

Believed to have been written in the 1390s, Chaucer&#x27;s short poem &quot;Fortune&quot;, is also inferred to directly reference Lancaster. &quot;Chaucer as narrator&quot; openly defies &quot;Fortune&quot;, proclaiming he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares &quot;my suffisaunce&quot; (15) and that &quot;over himself hath the maystrye&quot; (14). &quot;Fortune&quot;, in turn, does not understand Chaucer&#x27;s harsh words to her for she believes she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, &quot;And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve&quot; (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts that &quot;My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse&quot; (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. &quot;Fortune&quot; turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and &quot;Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne&quot; (78–79). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and a portion of line 76, &quot;as three of you or tweyne,&quot; to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes. Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;beste frend&quot;. &quot;Fortune&quot; states three times in her response to the plaintiff, &quot;And also, you still have your best friend alive&quot; (32, 40, 48); she also references his &quot;beste frend&quot; in the envoy when appealing to his &quot;noblesse&quot; to help Chaucer to a higher estate. A fifth reference is made by &quot;Chaucer as narrator&quot; who rails at &quot;Fortune&quot; that she shall not take his friend from him. While the envoy playfully hints to Lancaster that Chaucer would certainly appreciate a boost to his status or income, the poem &quot;Fortune&quot; distinctively shows his deep appreciation and affection for John of Gaunt.

== Death ==
John of Gaunt died of natural causes on 3 February 1399 at Leicester Castle, with his third wife Katherine by his side.

He was buried beside his first wife, Blanche of Lancaster, in the choir of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, adjacent to the high altar. Their magnificent tomb had been designed and executed between 1374 and 1380 by Henry Yevele with the assistance of Thomas Wrek, at a total cost of £592. The two alabaster effigies were notable for having their right hands joined. An adjacent chantry chapel was added between 1399 and 1403. During the reformation when other stonework in the cathedral was taken down in 1552, the tomb was spared by a command of the council, but was stripped plain. During the period of the Interregnum (1649–1660) it was severely damaged, and perhaps destroyed; anything that survived was lost (with the rest of the cathedral) in the Great Fire of London of 1666. A wall memorial in the crypt of the present cathedral lists Gaunt&#x27;s as among the important lost monuments.

== Family ==
=== Marriages ===
* On 19 May 1359 at Reading Abbey, John married his third cousin, Blanche of Lancaster, younger of the two daughters of Henry of Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster. Both shared a common descent from King Henry III. The wealth she brought to the marriage was the foundation of John&#x27;s fortune. Blanche died on 12 September 1368 at Tutbury Castle, while her husband was overseas. Their son Henry Bolingbroke became Henry IV of England, having deposed King Richard II, who had seized the duchy of Lancaster upon John&#x27;s death while Henry was in exile. Their daughter Philippa of Lancaster became Queen of Portugal by marrying King John I of Portugal in 1387. All subsequent kings of Portugal beginning from the House of Aviz were thus descended from John of Gaunt. Philippa&#x27;s daughter Isabella, married Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. Their lone heiress, Mary, the only child of Philip&#x27;s only legitimate son Charles the Bold, married her 2nd cousin, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, whose mother Eleanor, was the daughter of Philippa&#x27;s son Edward. Their grandson Charles married Isabella, daughter of Manuel I of Portugal, a male line grandson of Edward. 
* In 1371, John married Infanta Constance of Castile, daughter of King Peter of Castile, thus giving him a claim to the Crown of Castile, which he would pursue. Constance died in 1394. Though John was never able to make good his claim, his daughter by Constance, Catherine of Lancaster, became Queen of Castile by marrying Henry III of Castile. Catherine of Aragon &amp; Joanna of Castille are descended from Catherine through their mother Isabella I, daughter of Catherine&#x27;s son John II. Isabella I was also a descendant of Catherine&#x27;s half-sister Philippa, through her mother Isabella, who was the daughter of Philippa&#x27;s other son John. Hence the House of Hapsburg is also related to John of Gaunt. 
* During his marriage to Constance, John of Gaunt fathered four children by a mistress, the widow Katherine Swynford (whose sister Philippa Roet was married to Geoffrey Chaucer). Prior to her widowhood, Katherine had had at least two children with her husband, Sir Hugh Swynford from Kettlethorpe in Lincolnshire. These were Blanche, for whom John of Gaunt stood as godfather, and Thomas, later Sir Thomas. John married Katherine in 1396, and their four children, the Beauforts, were legitimised by King Richard II and the Church, but barred from inheriting the throne. From the eldest son, John, descended a granddaughter, Lady Margaret Beaufort, whose son, later King Henry VII of England, would nevertheless claim the throne.

=== Children ===

==Titles and arms==

===Titles and styles===
*Earl of Richmond: granted as an infant in September 1342, surrendered to the crown in June 1372.
*Earl of Leicester, Earl of Lancaster, Earl of Derby: inherited &quot;jure uxoris&quot; in November 1362 following the death of his wife&#x27;s father Henry of Grosmont.
*Duke of Lancaster: granted as a new creation on 13 November 1362 following the death of the prior Duke, Henry of Grosmont.
*King of Galicia, King of Castile, King of León: claimed in January 1372 by his second marriage to the heiress to these thrones, unrecognised except for a brief period when he was able to capture Galicia from 1386 to 1387; claim surrendered 1388.
*Duke of Aquitaine (2 March 1390 – 3 February 1399): granted for life in March 1390 by his nephew, King Richard II of England

===Arms===

As a son of the sovereign, John bore the royal arms of the kingdom (&quot;Quarterly, France Ancient and England&quot;), differenced by a label of three points ermine.

As claimant to the throne of Castile and León from 1372, he impaled the arms of that kingdom (&quot;Gules, a castle or, quartering Argent, a lion rampant purpure&quot;) with his own. The arms of Castile and León appeared on the dexter side of the shield (the left-hand side as viewed), and the differenced English royal arms on the sinister; but in 1388, when he surrendered his claim, he reversed this marshalling, placing his own arms on the dexter, and those of Castile and León on the sinister. He thus continued to signal his alliance with the Castilian royal house, while abandoning any claim to the throne. There is, however, evidence that he may occasionally have used this second marshalling at earlier dates.

In addition to his royal arms, Gaunt bore an alternative coat of &quot;Sable, three ostrich feathers ermine&quot;. This was the counterpart to his brother, the Black Prince&#x27;s, &quot;shield for peace&quot; (on which the ostrich feathers were white), and may have been used in jousting. The ostrich feather arms appeared in stained glass above Gaunt&#x27;s chantry chapel in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

== Legacy ==
John of Gaunt is a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard II&quot;. Shortly before he dies, he makes a speech that includes the lines (in Act 2, scene i, around line 40) &quot;This royal throne of kings, this scepter&#x27;d isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars ... This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England&quot;. He is also referred to by Falstaff in &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; (in Act 2, scene ii).

Hungerford in Berkshire has ancient links to the Duchy, the manor becoming part of John of Gaunt&#x27;s estate in 1362 before James I passed ownership to two local men in 1612 (which subsequently became Town &amp; Manor of Hungerford Charity). The links are visible today in the Town &amp; Manor-owned John O&#x27;Gaunt Inn on Bridge Street, and John O&#x27;Gaunt School on Priory Road.

<text>Lincolnshire (), abbreviated &quot;Lincs&quot;, is a ceremonial county in the East Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber regions of England. It is bordered by the East Riding of Yorkshire across the Humber estuary to the north, the North Sea to the east, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Rutland to the south, and Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire to the west. 

The county is predominantly rural, with an area of and a population of 1,095,010. After Lincoln (104,565), the largest towns are Grimsby (85,911) and Scunthorpe (81,286). For local government purposes Lincolnshire comprises a non-metropolitan county with seven districts, and the unitary authority areas of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. The last two areas are part of the Yorkshire and the Humber region, and the rest of the county is in the East Midlands. From May 2025 the non-metropolitan county council and two unitary councils will collaborate through the Greater Lincolnshire Combined County Authority.

The county is the second largest in England and has a varied geography. The south-west contains part of the Fens, a naturally marshy region which has been drained for agriculture, and the south-east is an upland region. A wide vale runs north–south from the centre to the north of the county. To its east, the chalk hills of the Lincolnshire Wolds, which have been designated a national landscape, occupy the north-east, with a coastal plain and the Lincolnshire Marsh beyond. The west of the vale is demarcated by the Lincolnshire Edge, a long escarpment; at its northern end are the Coversands, an area of heath. Beyond the edge, the western border of the county contains the eastern part of the Trent Valley and, in the north, part of the Humberhead Levels, with the River Trent itself forming part of the border.

Lincolnshire has had a comparatively quiet history, being a rural county which was not heavily industrialised and faced little threat of invasion. In the Roman era Lincoln was a major settlement, called Lindum Colonia. In the fifth century what would become the county was settled by the invading Angles, who established the Kingdom of Lindsey in the north of the region. Lincoln became the centre of a diocese in 1072, and Lincoln Cathedral was built over the following centuries. The late Middle Ages were a particularly prosperous period, when wealth from wool trade facilitated the building of grand churches such as St Botolph&#x27;s Church, Boston. During the Second World War the relatively flat topography of the county made it an important base for the Royal Air Force, which built several airfields and based two bomber squadrons in the area.

==History==
During pre-Roman times, most of Lincolnshire was inhabited by the Corieltauvi people. The language of the area at that time would have been Common Brittonic, the precursor to modern Welsh. The name &quot;Lincoln&quot; was derived from Lindum Colonia.

Large numbers of Germanic speakers from continental Europe settled in the region following the withdrawal of the Romans. Though these were later identified as Angles, it is unlikely that they migrated as part of an organized tribal group. Thus, the main language of the region quickly became Old English. However, it is possible that Brittonic continued to be spoken in some communities as late as the eighth century.

Modern-day Lincolnshire is derived from the merging of the territory of the Kingdom of Lindsey with that controlled by the Danelaw borough of Stamford. For some time the entire county was called &quot;Lindsey&quot;, and it is recorded as such in the 11th-century &quot;Domesday Book.&quot; Later, the name Lindsey was applied to the northern core, around Lincoln. This emerged as one of the three Parts of Lincolnshire, along with the Parts of Holland in the south-east, and the Parts of Kesteven in the south-west, which each had separate Quarter Sessions as their county administrations. Lindsay was traditionally split between the North, South and West Ridings of Lindsey.

The area was shaken by 27 February 2008 Lincolnshire earthquake, reaching between 4.7 and 5.3 on the Richter magnitude scale; it was one of the largest earthquakes to affect Britain in recent years.

Lincolnshire is home to Woolsthorpe Manor, birthplace and home of Sir Isaac Newton. He attended The King&#x27;s School, Grantham. Its library has preserved his signature, carved into a window sill when he was a youth.
== Geography ==

The geographical layout of Lincolnshire is quite extensive and mostly separated by many rivers and rolling countryside. The north of the county begins from where the Isle of Axholme is located near the meeting points of the rivers Ouse and Trent near to the Humber. From there, the southside of the Humber estuary forms the border between Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire. From there, the south bank of the Humber Estuary where the Humber Bridge crosses the estuary at Barton upon Humber, is used primarily for the shipping ports at Immingham, New Holland and Grimsby. From there, the rest of the southern bank forms the Lincolnshire Coast from Cleethorpes to Mablethorpe and then onto Skegness. From Skegness, the rest of the Lincolnshire Coastline forms the sea boundary and border with Norfolk at the Wash. The coast then at Boston becomes the meeting point of the rivers Welland and Haven in an area known as the &quot;Fosdyke Wash&quot;.

The rest of the sea boundary runs from Fosdyke to the east of Sutton Bridge, where the current land boundary with Norfolk is located in a narrow area of reclaimed farmland just to the east of the River Nene but until as recently as the early 19th century there was no land border between Lincolnshire and Norfolk as it was separated from each other by the &quot;Cross Keys Wash&quot; a former area of estuary and marshland where the River Nene used to flow out into the Wash and could only be crossed at low tide by a causeway or ferry and was the natural boundary between the two counties. The causeway known at the time as the &quot;Wash Way&quot; was renowned as being particularly treacherous and the safer route was to go into Norfolk from Lincolnshire via the Cambridgeshire town of Wisbech and this element remains to the present day as the Cross Keys Bridge at Sutton Bridge provides the only direct access point to Norfolk from Lincolnshire over the River Nene some nine miles north of Wisbech. The border with Lincolnshire to Cambridgeshire begins at Crowland, Market Deeping and Stamford which form the southern boundary of the county with both Peterborough, Rutland and briefly Northamptonshire; the county&#x27;s border with Northamptonshire is just long, England&#x27;s shortest county boundary. From there, the border with Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire begins at Sleaford, Grantham, Lincoln and Gainsborough. From Gainsborough, the border with South Yorkshire begins at Haxey and Epworth before looping back to the original north of the county near Scunthorpe with East Riding of Yorkshire at the Isle of Axholme and Goole.

Bedrock in Lincolnshire features Jurassic limestone (near Lincoln) and Cretaceous chalk (north-east). The area around Woodhall Spa and Kirkby on Bain is dominated by gravel and sand. For much of prehistory, Lincolnshire was under tropical seas, and most fossils found in the county are marine invertebrates. Marine vertebrates have also been found including ichthyosaurus and plesiosaur.

The highest point in Lincolnshire is Wolds Top (), at Normanby le Wold. Some parts of the Fens may be below sea level. The nearest mountains are in Derbyshire.

The biggest rivers in Lincolnshire are the Trent, running northwards from Staffordshire up the western edge of the county to the Humber estuary, and the Witham, which begins in Lincolnshire at South Witham and runs for through the middle of the county, eventually emptying into the North Sea at The Wash. The Humber estuary, on Lincolnshire&#x27;s northern border, is also fed by the River Ouse. The Wash is also the mouth of the Welland, the Nene and the Great Ouse.

Lincolnshire&#x27;s geography is fairly varied, but consists of several distinct areas:
*Lincolnshire Wolds: area of rolling hills in the north-east of the county designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty
*The Fens: dominating the south-east quarter of the county
*The Marshes: running along the coast of the county 
*Lincoln Edge or Cliff: limestone escarpment running north–south along the western half of the county

Lincolnshire&#x27;s most well-known nature reserves include Gibraltar Point National Nature Reserve, Whisby Nature Park Local Nature Reserve, Donna Nook National Nature Reserve, RSPB Frampton Marsh and the Humberhead Peatlands National Nature Reserve. Although the Lincolnshire countryside is intensively farmed, there are many biodiverse wetland areas, as well as rare limewood forests. Much of the county was once wet fenland (see The Fens).

From bones, we can tell that animal species formerly found in Lincolnshire include woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, wild horse, wolf, wild boar and beaver. Species which have recently returned to Lincolnshire after extirpation include little egret, Eurasian spoonbill, European otter and red kite.

==Governance==

===Local government history===
The Local Government Act 1888 established county councils for each of the parts of Lincolnshire – Lindsey, Holland and Kesteven – and came into effect on 1 April 1889. Lincoln was made an independent county borough on the same date, with Grimsby following in 1891.

The Local Government Act 1972 abolished the three county councils and the two county boroughs, effective 1 April 1974. On this date, Grimsby and the northern part of Lindsey (including Scunthorpe) were amalgamated with most of the East Riding of Yorkshire and a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire to form the new non-metropolitan county of Humberside. The rest of Lindsey, along with Holland, Kesteven and Lincoln, came under the governance of the new Lincolnshire County Council.

A local government reform in 1996 abolished Humberside. The land south of the Humber Estuary was allocated to the unitary authorities of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire which became part of Lincolnshire for ceremonial purposes, such as the Lord-Lieutenancy, but are not covered by the Lincolnshire police; they are in the Yorkshire and the Humber region.
The remaining districts of Lincolnshire are Boston, East Lindsey, Lincoln, North Kesteven, South Holland, South Kesteven, and West Lindsey. They are part of the East Midlands region.

North East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire are unitary authorities. They were districts of Humberside county from 1974. In 1996, Humberside was abolished along with its county council. Some services in those districts are shared with the East Riding of Yorkshire ceremonial county, rather than the rest of Lincolnshire including Humberside Police, Humberside Airport, Humberside Fire Service, and BBC Radio Humberside.

===Current governance===

Since the 2024 general election and the constituency reorganisation by the 2023 Periodic Review, Lincolnshire is represented by ten Members of Parliament (MPs) whose constituencies fall entirely within the county. Small areas of Lincolnshire form constituencies with parts of neighbouring counties, namely the Isle of Axholme (part of Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme) and the town of Stamford and its surroundings (part of Rutland and Stamford). Of the ten constituencies entirely within Lincolnshire, six are represented by the Conservative Party, three by the Labour Party and one by Reform UK.

Lincolnshire County Council is majority controlled by the Conservative Party, and consists of 54 Conservative councillors, four Labour, four South Holland Independents, four independents, three Liberal Democrats and one Lincolnshire Independent. The county is made up of seven local borough and district councils and two unitary authority areas independent of the county council. The City of Lincoln Council is Labour-controlled. North Kesteven, South Holland and East Lindsey are administered by the Conservatives. South Kesteven is controlled by a coalition of independent, Labour Party, Green Party and Liberal Democrat councillors. West Lindsey is controlled by a coalition of Liberal Democrats and independents. The Borough of Boston is controlled by the local Boston Independent party. The unitary authority North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire councils are administered by the Conservative Party.

A mayoral devolution deal has received approval from the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government. This lead to the establishment of a Greater Lincolnshire Combined County Authority, formed of the county council, the two unitary authorities and the district councils, with powers over housing, job creation and public transport, including bus franchising. The first election for the Mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, who will chair GLCCA, is expected to take place in May 2025.

====Central Lincolnshire====
The Central Lincolnshire area is a joint partnership arrangement between North Kesteven, Lincoln and West Lindsey, covering economic planning and development across the three districts.

==Demography==
The following tables show the ethnic and religious composition of Lincolnshire in 2021:


==Economy==

: includes hunting and forestry
: includes energy and construction
: includes financial intermediation services indirectly measured

Notable businesses based in Lincolnshire include the Lincs FM Group, Young&#x27;s Seafood, Openfield and the Lincolnshire Co-operative (whose membership includes about one quarter of the population of the county).

===Agriculture===

Lincolnshire has long been a primarily agricultural area, and it continues to grow large amounts of wheat, barley, sugar beet, and oilseed rape. In south Lincolnshire, where the soil is particularly rich in nutrients, some of the most common crops include potatoes, cabbages, cauliflowers, and onions. Lincolnshire farmers often break world records for crop yields. South Lincolnshire is also home to one of the UK&#x27;s leading agricultural experiment stations, located in Sutton Bridge and operated by the Potato Council; Sutton Bridge Crop Storage Research engages in research for the British potato industry.

The Lincoln Longwool is a rare breed of sheep, named after the region, which was developed both for wool and mutton, at least 500 years ago, and has the longest fleece of any sheep breed. The Lincoln Red is an old breed of beef cattle, originating from the county. In the mid 20th century most farms in Lincolnshire moved away from mixed farming to specialise in arable cropping, partly due to cheap wool imports, partly to take advantage of efficiencies of scale and partly because the drier land on the eastern side of England is particularly suitable for arable cropping.

Mechanisation around 1900 greatly diminished the number of workers required to operate the county&#x27;s relatively large farms, and the proportion of workers in the agricultural sector dropped substantially during this period. Several major engineering companies developed in Lincoln, Gainsborough and Grantham to support those changes. Among these was Fosters of Lincoln, which built the first tank, and Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons of Grantham. Most such industrial companies left during late 20th-century restructuring.

Today, immigrant workers, mainly from new member states of the European Union in Central and Eastern Europe, form a large component of the seasonal agricultural workforce, particularly in the south of the county. Here more labour-intensive crops are produced, such as small vegetables and cut flowers. This seasonal influx of migrant labour occasionally causes tension between the migrant workforce and local people, in a county which had been relatively unaccustomed to large-scale immigration. Agricultural training is provided at Riseholme College and in 2016 the University of Lincoln opened the Lincoln Institute for Agri-Food Technology.

===Services and retail===
According to an Intra-governmental Group on Geographic Information (IGGI) study in 2000, the town centres were ranked by area thus (including North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire areas):
*Lincoln
*Grantham
*Grimsby
*Boston and Scunthorpe (equal)
*Spalding
*Stamford
*Skegness
*Louth
*Sleaford
*Gainsborough
*Brigg
*Cleethorpes
*Bourne
*Horncastle and Mablethorpe (equal)

==Public services==

===Education===

Lincolnshire is one of the few counties in the UK that still uses the eleven-plus to decide who may attend grammar school. As a result, many towns in Lincolnshire have both a grammar school and a secondary modern school. Lincolnshire&#x27;s rural character means that some larger villages also have primary schools and are served by buses to nearby high schools.

Lincoln itself, however, is primarily non-selective, as is the area within a radius of about seven miles. In this area, almost all children attend comprehensive schools, though it is still possible to opt into the eleven-plus system. This gives rise to the unusual result that those who pass the eleven-plus can attend a grammar school outside the Lincoln comprehensive area, but those who do not pass still attend a (partly non-selective) comprehensive school.

Lincolnshire is also home of University of Lincoln.

===Health care===
The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust is one of the largest trusts in the country, employing almost 4,000 staff and with an annual budget of over £200 million. The north of the county is served by the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Some of the larger hospitals in the county include:

*Diana Princess of Wales Hospital, Grimsby
*Scunthorpe General Hospital
*Boston Pilgrim Hospital
*Lincoln County Hospital

Since April 1994, Lincolnshire has had an air ambulance service. The air ambulance is stationed at RAF Waddington near Lincoln and can reach emergencies in Lincolnshire within 25 minutes. An A&amp;E hospital is only 10 minutes away by helicopter from any accident in Lincolnshire.

===Drainage===
Separately to the commercial water companies the low-lying parts of the county are drained by various internal drainage boards, such as the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board,Witham 4th District IDB, Lindsey Marsh Drainage Board , or the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Being on the economic periphery of England, Lincolnshire&#x27;s transport links are poorly developed compared with many other parts of the United Kingdom. The road network in the county is dominated by single carriageway A roads and local roads (B roads) as opposed to motorways and dual carriageways. The administrative county of Lincolnshire is one of the few UK counties without a motorway, and until several years ago, it was said that there was only about of dual carriageway in the whole of Lincolnshire. However the M180 motorway passes through North Lincolnshire, splitting into two dual carriageway trunk roads to the Humber Bridge and Grimsby, and the A46 is now dual carriageway between Newark-on-Trent and Lincoln.

===Railways: history and present day===
The low population density of the county means there are few railway stations and train services, considering the county&#x27;s large area. Many of the county&#x27;s railway stations were permanently closed following the Beeching Report of 1963. The most notable reopening has been the line and two stations between Lincoln and Sleaford, which reopened within months of the Beeching closure. Most other closed lines in the county were lifted long ago and much of the trackbed has returned to agricultural use.

Prior to 1970, a through train service operated between Cleethorpes and London King&#x27;s Cross via Louth, Boston and Peterborough. The part of this line in Grimsby is now the A16 road, preventing reinstatement as a railway line, and a small section of the line is now the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway, with an extension towards Louth in progress.

A daily through train service operated between Cleethorpes and London King&#x27;s Cross via Grimsby, Market Rasen and Lincoln Central until the late 1980s. The &quot;Humberlincs Executive&quot;, as the service was known, was operated by an InterCity 125, but was discontinued following the electrification of the East Coast Main Line. Passengers to/from London now have to change trains at Newark North Gate. However, the East Coast Main Line passes through the western edge of the county and one can catch direct trains to London from Grantham.
Most rail services are currently operated by East Midlands Railway and Northern Trains. London North Eastern Railway (LNER), Hull Trains and CrossCountry have services which pass through the county, with LNER trains frequently passing and stopping at Grantham, on the East Coast Main Line and a service every other hour to Lincoln, while CrossCountry trains stop at Stamford on their way between Birmingham and Stansted Airport. Stations along the Humber are served by TransPennine Express services between Manchester Airport and Cleethorpes. One of the most infrequent services in the UK is in Lincolnshire: the Sheffield-Gainsborough Central-Cleethorpes line has passenger trains only on a Saturday, with three trains in both directions. This line is, however, used for freight. Hull Trains also stops at Grantham before continuing its journey to either Kings Cross or Hull.

On 22 May 2011, East Coast started a Lincoln-London service, initially one train a day each way, and there is a northbound service on a Sunday. This was increased in 2019 to a service every two hours. East Midlands Railway also run a daily (Mon-Sat) service each way between Lincoln and London St Pancras, though this is a stopping service which takes around three hours via Nottingham, compared to LNER&#x27;s service to London King&#x27;s Cross which takes around 1 hour 50 minutes.

===Airport===
The only airport in Lincolnshire is Humberside Airport, near Brigg. East Midlands Airport, the main airport servicing the East Midlands, is within travelling distance of the county. Until its closure in 2022, Doncaster Sheffield Airport near Doncaster was within travelling distance of much of Lincolnshire.

===Buses===
The county&#x27;s biggest bus companies are Stagecoach Grimsby-Cleethorpes (formerly Grimsby-Cleethorpes Transport) and Stagecoach in Lincolnshire (formerly Lincolnshire Road Car). There are several smaller bus companies, including Brylaine of Boston, Delaine Buses and Hornsby&#x27;s of Scunthorpe.

===Cycle routes===

* A Sustrans cycle route runs from Lincoln to Boston in the south of the county.
* Historic Lincoln &amp; Surrounding Area. 
* All Lincolnshire cycle routes

== Towns and villages ==

In terms of population, the 12 biggest settlements in the county by population are:

*Lincoln (population: 104,565)
*Grimsby (population: 85,911)
*Scunthorpe (population: 81,286)
*Boston (population: 45,339)
*Grantham (population: 44,898)
*Spalding (population: 30,556)
*Cleethorpes (population: 29,678)
*Gainsborough (population: 21,908)
*Stamford (population: 20,742)
*Skegness (population: 20,704)
*Sleaford (population: 18,033)
*Bourne (population: 17,490)

A small part of the Thorne Waste area of the town of Thorne in South Yorkshire, known as the Yorkshire Triangle, currently falls under North Lincolnshire.

==Tourism==
The majority of tourism in Lincolnshire relies on the coastal resorts and towns to the east of the Lincolnshire Wolds. The county has some of the best-known seaside resorts in the United Kingdom, which are a major attraction to visitors from across England, especially the East Midlands and parts of Yorkshire. There are three main coastal resorts in Lincolnshire and several smaller village resorts:

*The main county seaside resort of Skegness with its famous Jolly Fisherman mascot and famous slogan &quot;Skegness is so bracing&quot;, together with its neighbouring large village coastal resorts of Ingoldmells and Chapel St Leonards, provides the biggest concentration of resorts along the Lincolnshire Coast, with many large caravan and holiday sites. The resort offers many amusements, beaches, leisure activities and shops, as well as Butlins Skegness, Fantasy Island, Church Farm Museum, Natureland Seal Sanctuary, Skegness Stadium, Skegness Pier and several well-known local golf courses. There are good road, bus and rail links to the rest of the county.
*The second largest group of resorts along the coast is composed of the seaside towns of Mablethorpe and Sutton-on-Sea, famous for its golden sands, and the neighbouring village resort of Trusthorpe. This area also offers leisure activities and has large caravan and holiday sites. The area is less developed, with fewer amusement arcades and nightclubs, and poorer road links to the rest of the county; but the area offers a more traditional seaside setting.
*The third group of resorts includes the seaside town of Cleethorpes and the large village resort of Humberston within North East Lincolnshire. It has the Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway and Cleethorpes Pier, along with golf courses and caravan and holiday sites, whilst it is also the former site of Pleasure Island Family Theme Park. Cleethorpes is well served by road and rail; it is easily accessible from the M180 and the TransPennine Express route to Manchester.

Nature is an attraction for many tourists: the south-east of the county is mainly fenland that attracts many species of birds, as do the national nature reserves at Gibraltar Point, Saltfleetby-Theddlethorpe and Donna Nook, which also contains a large grey seal colony which is popular with visitors.

The market towns of the Lincolnshire Wolds, Louth, Alford, Horncastle, Caistor and Spilsby are also attractive, with several having historically important buildings, such as Alford Manor House, St James&#x27; Church, Louth and Bolingbroke Castle. The Wolds are popular for cycling and walking, with regular events such as the Lincolnshire Wolds Walking Festival.

The city of Lincoln is home to many tourist attractions including Lincoln Castle, Lincoln Cathedral, The Engine Shed, Steep Hill, International Bomber Command Centre and Guildhall and Stonebow among other historical landmarks and listed buildings. The city is one of the many tourist centres in the East Midlands Region.

==Culture==
Lincolnshire has a rustic culture. Due to the large distances between the towns, many villages have remained very self-contained, with many still having shops, pubs, local halls and local chapels and churches, offering a variety of social activities for residents. Fishing (in the extensive river and drainage system in the fens) and shooting are popular activities. A lot of the culture in Lincoln itself is based upon its history. The Collection is an archaeological museum and art gallery in Lincoln. Lincoln Cathedral also plays a large part in Lincoln&#x27;s culture, hosting many events throughout the year, from concert recitals to indoor food markets.

A Lincolnshire tradition was that front doors were used for only three things: a new baby, a bride, and a coffin.

===Urban areas===

While Lincolnshire maintains a rural setting, certain parts of the county form urban areas around its larger settlements or growing centres. Such as, Grimsby-Cleethorpes form the largest urban area in the county with a population of 137,021. The second largest urban area is Lincoln which incorporates the town of North Hykeham and villages of Bracebridge Heath and Waddington. The population of the urban area was recorded at 129,305. Other urban areas include Scunthorpe which includes the town of Bottesford and had a population of 81,286. Other urban areas include: Grantham (46,778) Boston (45,339), Spalding (35,064), Skegness (26,065) and Gainsborough (22,913).

===People===

Those born in Lincolnshire are sometimes given the nickname of Yellowbellies (often spelt &quot;Yeller Bellies&quot;, to reflect the pronunciation of the phrase by the typical Lincolnshire farmer). The origin of this term is debated but is most commonly believed to derive from the uniform of the 10th Regiment of Foot (later the Lincolnshire Regiment) which featured yellow facings. For this reason, the coat of arms of Lincolnshire County Council is supported by two officers of the regiment.

===Local dialect===
In common with most other Northern and Midlands dialects in England, &quot;flat&quot; &quot;a&quot; is preferred, i.e. over , and also traditionally in words like &#x27;water&#x27;, pronounced &quot;watter&quot; (though such a pronunciation is rarely heard nowadays). Similarly, is usually replaced by . Features rather more confined to Lincolnshire include:
*Elaboration of Received Pronunciation English or into a complex triphthong approximating, and often transcribed &quot;-air-&quot; or &quot;-yair-&quot;. For example: &#x27;mate&#x27; ; &#x27;beast&#x27; ; &quot;tates&quot; (potatoes) .
*An equivalent elaboration of standard English – commonly in Northern England – into &quot;-ooa-&quot;. For example, &#x27;boat&#x27; .
*Insertion of an extra schwa into the standard English diphthong .
*Vocabulary: &#x27;duck&#x27; as a term of endearment or informal address, &#x27;mardy&#x27; meaning upset or angry, &quot;mowt&quot; (pronounced like &#x27;mout&#x27;) for &#x27;might&#x27;, &quot;while&quot; as a substitute for standard English &#x27;until&#x27;, &quot;frit&quot; meaning frightened, &quot;grufty&quot; meaning dirty or disgusting, and the inimitable salutation &quot;now then!?&quot; (hello), sometimes written &quot;nairn&quot; to reflect pronunciation.
*In the north-east of the county, around Grimsby and Immingham, the nurse-square merger can be heard, as is also the case along the east coast of Yorkshire and also in Liverpool. Words that take in RP take in these areas.

Lincolnshire has its own dialect &quot;champion&quot;, a farmer from the village of Minting called Farmer Wink (real name Robert Carlton), who has produced videos about rural life, narrated in his broad Lincolnshire accent. A resident of Woodhall Spa has published a dictionary of words once prevalent in parts of the county.

===Music===
&quot;The Lincolnshire Poacher&quot;, a folksong, is the country&#x27;s best-known melody and almost its unofficial anthem. It describes the delights of nocturnal poaching. It was the regimental quick march of the 10th Regiment of Foot and its successors the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment, who are known as &quot;the Poachers&quot;.

Lincolnshire was historically associated with the Lincolnshire bagpipes, instruments derided as coarse and unpleasant in contemporary literature, but noted as very popular in the county. The last player, John Hunsley of Middle Manton, died in 1851, and since then the instrument has been extinct.

The Australian composer Percy Grainger made what are thought to be the first recordings of British Folksongs between 1906 and 1908 in Lincolnshire using a wax Phonograph Cylinder. These are now housed in the British Library. They included songs sung by Joseph Taylor of Saxby-All-Saints who became the first folk singer to be commercially recorded and whose rendition of Brigg Fair inspired classical works by Grainger and Frederick Delius. In 1937, Grainger wrote his &quot;Lincolnshire Posy&quot; for wind band. The piece is a compilation of folk songs (&quot;bunch of wildflowers&quot;) collected by the composer in and around the county of Lincolnshire. Ralph Vaughan Williams was a frequent guest at Gunby Hall. The manuscript of his collected folksong &quot;Daffodils&quot; is in their collection.

Several composers have lived and worked in the county. William Byrd was organist and master of the choristers at Lincoln Cathedral from 1563 to 1572. John Taverner was listed as a lay clerk at Tattershall Collegiate Church in 1525 and also sang at St Botolph&#x27;s Church, Boston under whose famous &quot;stump&quot; he is presumed to be buried. Thomas Linley, composer, a friend of Mozart, drowned in the lake at Grimsthorpe Castle near Bourne in 1778. Nicholas Maw was born in Grantham and Peter Seabourne lives in East Kirkby.

===Food===

Lincolnshire has a number of local dishes:
*Stuffed chine – this is salted neck-chine of a pig taken from between the shoulder blades, salted for up to ten months and stuffed with parsley (other ingredients are normally kept secret), and served cold.
*Haslet – a type of pork loaf, also flavoured with sage (pronounced HAYSS-let or AYSS-let in Lincolnshire but HAZ-let in many other parts of the country).
*Lincolnshire sausages – most butchers in Lincolnshire have their own secret recipe for these and a competition is held each year to judge the best sausages in the county. Traditional Lincolnshire sausages are made entirely from minced pork, stale bread crumb (rusk is used nowadays) pepper, sage and salt. The skins should be natural casings which are made from the intestines of either sheep or pig.
*Pork pies – the same pork butchers will take a pride in their unique recipe for pork pies.
*Giblet pie.
*Mutton stuffed with oysters.
*Plum bread – as with plum pudding, plum refers to dried fruit, namely currants, raisins and sultanas, sometimes soaked in tea.
*Grantham Gingerbread – a hard white ginger biscuit.
*Lincolnshire Poacher cheese – a cheddar-style cheese produced in Alford. Lincolnshire Poacher has won numerous awards over the years including Supreme Champion at the 1996/7 British Cheese Awards and Best British Cheese at the World Cheese awards in 2001/2. 
*Batemans ales – a beer brewed in Wainfleet and served in many pubs in the county and further afield.
*There are several small breweries.
*Grimsby is renowned for its fishing industry, and historically &quot;Grimsby Fish&quot; has carried a premium price. Since the decline of the fishing industry following entry to the European Economic Community in the 1970s this is no longer the case, with the majority of fish sold at the town&#x27;s fish market being brought overland from other ports. However, &quot;Grimsby Fish&quot; is still a recognised &quot;product&quot;, one associated with a particular area that specialises in and has expertise in a particular trade (cf &quot;Sheffield steel&quot;). In 2009 smoked fish from the town was granted Protected Geographical Indication by the European Union, reflecting the unique smoking methods used by certain local fish companies.
Craft Chocolatiers can be found throughout the county, such as Hansens in Folkingham. In 2013 Redstar Chocolate&#x27;s &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Venezuela Ocumare Milk&quot; won a gold medal as best bean-to-bar. The factory is in Cleethorpes.

===Annual events===
Every year the Lincolnshire Agricultural Society, founded in 1869, stages the Lincolnshire Agricultural Show. It is held on the Wednesday and Thursday of the last whole week of June at its showground at Grange de Lings, a few miles north of Lincoln on the A15. The show was first held here in 1958. First held around the year 1884, it is one of the largest agricultural shows in the country, and is attended by around 100,000 people over its two days. The showground is in regular use throughout the year for a wide range of other events and functions.

Smaller local agricultural shows, such as the Heckington Show can still be found. Corby Glen sheep fair has been held since 1238.
Each year RAF Waddington is the home to the RAF International Waddington Air Show. The two-day event attracts around 150,000 people and usually takes place during the first weekend of July. Since its inception over 35 countries have participated, with aircraft from around the globe attending the Lincolnshire Base. Beginning 2017, the event will be held at nearby RAF Scampton.

On the Monday before Easter, an unusual auction takes place in Bourne to let the grazing rights of the Whitebread Meadow. Bidding takes place while two boys race toward the Queen&#x27;s Bridge in Eastgate, the end of which dash is equivalent to the falling of the gavel. The whole affair dates back to the 1742 will of William Clay.

The Haxey Hood village competition takes place every January, as it has for over 700 years.

Stamford&#x27;s Mid-Lent fair sees showmen converge on the town the week after Mothering Sunday, with rides and sideshows filling Broad Street, the Sheepmarket and the Meadows for a week. Stalls selling Grantham gingerbread and nougat are a traditional feature. The following week sees them in Grantham, on the way north for the Summer. Roger Tuby brings a small funfair to Bourne and then to Spalding in Spring and returns in Autumn at the end of the season.

The villages of Tetford and Salmonby hold an annual Scarecrow Festival in May every year.

The Belchford Downhill Challenge which is held every two years: soapbox racers race down the hill at up to 30 km/h. The turnout has been up to 1,000.

Lincoln Christmas Market, was a street market held throughout the historic area of the city at the start of December, it was one of the largest Christmas markets in Europe, attracting over 250,000 people over the four-day event. Around the same time, Christmas lights are turned on in Bourne, Sleaford, Skegness, and other towns.

Throughout the summer the Stamford Shakespeare Company presents the Bard&#x27;s plays in the open-air theatre at Tolethorpe Hall, which is actually in Rutland.

The Spalding Flower Parade was held in late spring every year between 1959 and 2013. Colourful floats decorated with tulip heads competed for a cup.

Lost Village Festival is an annual music and arts event held in a secluded woodland near Norton Disney. Founded in 2015, the festival features a diverse program of live music, DJ sets, immersive theatre, comedy, and interactive experiences. 

The Asylum Steampunk Festival, frequently referred to simply as the Steampunk Festival in Lincoln, is an annual convention and celebration of steampunk culture held in the historic Cathedral Quarter of Lincoln, England. Established in 2009, it is recognized as one of the largest steampunk gatherings in Europe. The festival usually takes place over the August Bank Holiday weekend, drawing enthusiasts from across the globe.

===Sport===

The main sports played in the county are football, cricket and rugby union. Lincolnshire does not have a high sporting profile, mainly due to the lack of facilities and high-profile football teams. Probably the most well-known sporting venues in Lincolnshire are Cadwell Park near Louth, where a round of the British Motorbike Championship is held on the last Monday of August every year and the racecourse at Market Rasen

*Two teams from Lincolnshire play in the Football League: Lincoln City play in League One and Grimsby Town play in League Two. In non-league football, Boston United play in the National League, Scunthorpe United play in the National League North, and Gainsborough Trinity play in the Northern Premier League. A meeting between any of these clubs is a Lincolnshire derby; the most prominent meeting, having happened across four of the top five tiers of English football, is Lincoln City vs Grimsby Town.
*In cricket Lincolnshire are a minor county and play in the Minor Counties Championship.
*In hockey Lindum Hockey Club play in the north of Lincoln.
*Scunthorpe Rugby Club are the most notable rugby union team from Lincolnshire, and will play in the fifth level of the English league system in the 2017–18 season. Other notable teams include Market Rasen and Louth RUFC, Lincoln RFC, and Boston RFC.
*Lincolnshire is home to one racecourse, at Market Rasen.
*Cadwell Park is the only motor-racing course in Lincolnshire. There is a speedway track in Scunthorpe, home of the Scunthorpe Scorpions, and stock-car racing at a stadium at Orby, near Skegness.
*Lincolnshire has an American Football club, the Lincolnshire Bombers, which has existed in its current guise since 2005.
*Lincolnshire is home to the UK roller derby team, the Lincolnshire Bombers Roller Girls, which is sponsored by Motörhead.
*Lincolnshire is home to Lincolnshire Lions Rugby League who run an Open Age Men&#x27;s team, playing in the Midlands Merit League since 2022.

===Symbols===
The unofficial anthem of the county is the traditional folk song, &quot;The Lincolnshire Poacher&quot;, which dates from around 1776. A version of the song was the theme for BBC Radio Lincolnshire for many years.

According to a 2002 marketing campaign by the charity Plantlife, the county flower of Lincolnshire is the common dog-violet.

In August 2005, BBC Radio Lincolnshire and &quot;Lincolnshire Life&quot; magazine launched a vote for a flag of Lincolnshire to represent the county. Six competing designs were voted upon by locals and the winning submission was unveiled in October 2005. Lincoln has its own flag – St George&#x27;s flag with a Fleur-de-Lys.

The Lincoln Imp has symbolised cathedral, city and county for many years. In 2006 it was replaced as the brand of Lincolnshire County Council by the stylised version seen on the header here which has lost even the unique pose of the carving.

==Media==
===Press===
The county is home to one daily newspaper, the &quot;Grimsby Telegraph&quot; which as the name suggests, is published in the town and whose circulation area ostensibly covers North East Lincolnshire, although it reaches as far south as Louth and Alford and as west as Brigg.

There are two further weekly papers which used to be published daily until 2011; the &quot;Lincolnshire Echo&quot; is published weekly from Lincoln and covers the majority of the county reaching as far north as Louth, and the &quot;Scunthorpe Telegraph&quot; which covers northern Lincolnshire. All three are ultimately owned by Reach plc.

There are also a number of weekly papers serving individual towns published in the county by Iliffe Media. One of these, the &quot;Stamford Mercury&quot;, claims to be Britain&#x27;s oldest newspaper, although it is now a typical local weekly and no longer covers stories from the whole East Midlands as the archived copies did.

===Television===
With the exception of a small area to the south-west of the county, Lincolnshire is served from the Belmont transmitting station, receiving ITV Yorkshire and BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire regions. The BBC covers the county in &quot;Look North&quot; news from Hull, with input from studios in Lincoln and Grimsby. ITV provides coverage through &quot;Calendar&quot; news.

From 1959 to July 1974 ITV programmes were provided by Anglia Television, based in Norwich with news offices in Grimsby. Following a transmitter change, ITV services were provided by Yorkshire Television. This company kept open the offices in Grimsby and opened further facilities in Lincoln, although both of these closed in the mid-1990s.

South-west Lincolnshire receives BBC East Midlands and ITV Central which are broadcast from the Waltham transmitting station. Many villages just west of the Lincoln Cliff cannot get a signal from Belmont due to shadowing and instead get their TV from Emley Moor transmitting station near Huddersfield.

===Radio===
BBC local radio is provided by BBC Radio Lincolnshire and, in the north of the county, BBC Radio Humberside. Commercial local radio serving the county includes Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, Heart East, Hits Radio East Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire, Hits Radio Lincolnshire, Capital Yorkshire (in the north of the county) and Smooth East Midlands. The community radio stations in the county are Endeavour FM in Boston; TMCR 95.3 covering Epworth and Isle of Axholme; and LCR 103.6 in Lincoln.

==Military==
===Air===

Because of its flat geography and low population density, Lincolnshire is an ideal place for airfields, and the Air Ministry built prolifically with the county hosting nearly seventy separate air bases. It became known as &quot;bomber county&quot;. Since the end of the Second World War most of these airfields or stations were decommissioned, but the RAF retains a significant footprint in Lincolnshire for the air defence of the United Kingdom and aircrew training. For more information on former bases, see List of former RAF stations.

Two major front-line bases located in Lincolnshire are RAF Coningsby, which is one of only two RAF Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) Stations in the United Kingdom and home to the Eurofighter Typhoon jet fighters, and RAF Waddington, where most of the RAF&#x27;s Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance aircraft are based. The Red Arrows Aerobatic Team has also been based at Waddington since October 2022 after their previous base, RAF Scampton, was closed down. Other stations in Lincolnshire include RAF Cranwell, home to all Air Force Basic Officer Training for the Royal Air Force; RAF Barkston Heath, a training airfield; and minor bases such as RAF Donna Nook and RAF Digby.

Lincolnshire is also home to two active RAF and NATO-allied air weapons training bombing ranges, located along The Wash and north Lincolnshire coastline—RAF Holbeach active since 1926 (originally part of the former RAF Sutton Bridge station) and Donna Nook. The RAF Wainfleet range was decommissioned in 2010.

===Army===
The Army runs Sobraon Barracks, home of 160 (Lincoln) Squadron, Royal Logistic Corps (RLC), as well as Prince William of Gloucester Barracks, Grantham, home to the national specialist logistics units. In November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the Grantham site would close in 2020 but the timescale has twice been extended, latterly to 2028.

<doc id="53296" wikidata="Q263761" url="?curid=53296" title="Niels Bohr Institute">
<text>The Niels Bohr Institute () is a research institute of the University of Copenhagen. The research of the institute spans astronomy, geophysics, nanotechnology, particle physics, quantum mechanics, and biophysics.

==Overview==
The institute was founded in 1921, as the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the University of Copenhagen, by the Danish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr, who had been on the staff of the University of Copenhagen since 1914, and who had been lobbying for its creation since his appointment as professor in 1916. On the 80th anniversary of Niels Bohr&#x27;s birth – October 7, 1965 – the Institute officially became the Niels Bohr Institute. Much of its original funding came from the charitable foundation of the Carlsberg brewery, and later from the Rockefeller Foundation.

During the 1920s, and 1930s, the institute was the center of the developing disciplines of atomic physics and quantum physics. Physicists from across Europe (and sometimes further abroad) often visited the institute to confer with Bohr on new theories and discoveries. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is named after work done at the institute during this time.

Following his father&#x27;s death in 1962, Aage Bohr succeeded him as director of the Niels Bohr Institute, a position he held until 1970. He remained active there until he retired in 1992.

On January 1, 1993, the institute was merged with the Astronomic Observatory, the Ørsted Laboratory and the Geophysical Institute. The new resulting institute retained the name Niels Bohr Institute.

== Research sections ==
The research at the Niels Bohr Institute spans Astronomy, Geophysics, Nanophysics, Particles Physics, Quantum Physics and Biophysics. 

Research at the institute is based on observations, fieldwork, laboratory experiments and theoretical models for the purpose of understanding basic laws and complex truths on this world. The Institute has a broad network of scientific cooperation, and a lively exchange of collaborators and guests with leading international research groups.

=== Astrophysics ===
A broad spectrum of astronomy and astrophysics is researched at the Niels Bohr Institute – everything from the visible Universe such as planets, stars and galaxies – to the invisible universe and the presence of dark energy and dark matter. 

The NBI astrophysicists participate in many international projects and have access to modern telescopes and satellites via, e.g. Denmark’s membership of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the European Space Agency (ESA), and to state-of-the-art supercomputers. 

=== Biocomplexity and Biophysics ===
Biocomplexity is a cutting-edge area of research between physics and biology. By using the principles and methods of physics one can explore the living nature and biological phenomena.

Researchers at BioComplexity continuously explore the diversity of complex phenomena in biological, physical and social systems, including pattern formation, complex and chaotic dynamics, fluid dynamics, game theory, networks and econophysics. 

Physics approaches are used to suggest and perform experiments and models of living systems. The systems range from proteins and gene regulation to larger-scale collective spatiotemporal structure formation. The research at the institute is often performed as a collaboration between physicists, biologists, medical doctors, and nanoscientists.

=== Condensed Matter Physics ===
Condensed matter physics is concerned with the understanding of the physical properties of solids and liquids, both naturally occurring and artificially produced.

Condensed matter physics is the foundation for many every-day technologies, ranging from hardening of steel to integrated microchips. Modern research in condensed matter physics takes place in both large scale x-ray and neutron scattering facilities, as well as in locally based laboratories, where quantum phenomena are being explored at temperatures near absolute zero. There is a vivid exchange between condensed matter and neighboring research areas, including biophysics, nanoscience, chemistry, optics, and quantum information.

=== Experimental Particle Physics ===
How was the universe created, which inflation scenario played out in the first split second, what happened during the quark-gluon plasma era? What is the source of the mass spectrum of fundamental particles of matter and forces? These are some of the questions particle physicists are looking for answers to.

The Particle Physicists work with the build up of matter in the early universe. They are searching for an explanation as to what the universe&#x27;s smallest components were composed of in the first milliseconds after the Big Bang 14 billion years ago and what forces held them together.

=== Physics of Ice, Climate and Earth ===
The section for the Physics of Ice, Climate and Earth at the Niels Bohr Institute studies the elements of the Earth and climate system – the atmosphere, oceans, ice sheets and glaciers, sea ice, and the solid Earth itself – and the interactions between them.

=== Quantum Optics and Photonics ===
The Quantum Optics section conducts experimental and theoretical research in Quantum Optics, in particular, in Quantum Information Processing, Quantum Sensors , and Quantum Technologies. 

We use photons, from optics to microwaves interacting with a wide variety of quantum matter, such as quantum dots, single atoms, atomic ensembles and mechanical oscillators.

The overarching theme is generation and manipulation of non-classical entangled states for quantum simulation, sensing and communication. The research directions span from fundamental research to device engineering.

=== Theoretical high energy, astroparticle and gravitational physics ===
The Theoretical high energy, astroparticle and gravitational physics at the Niels Bohr Institute is involved in a wide scope of research activities centered around quantum theories of gauge fields, gravity and astrophysics.

Research areas include scattering amplitudes, effective field theory, black holes, holography, lattice simulations, quantum gravity, integrability, astroparticle physics, and cosmology.

== Research Centres ==

===Cosmic Dawn===

The Cosmic Dawn Center is an Astronomy/Cosmology research center, founded as a collaboration between the University of Copenhagen and DTU Space of the Danish Technical University (DTU). The center is led by center director and NBI Professor Sune Toft and center co-director Thomas Greve, Professor at DTU and UCL. The main objective of the center is to investigate the period known as the Cosmic Dawn (the transition period following the Cosmic Dark Ages), i.e. the reionization of the Universe and the formation of the first galaxies, through observations as well as through theory and simulations.

====Goals====
Research conducted at the center is focused on the specific period in the history of the Universe known as the &quot;Cosmic Dawn&quot;. This largely unexplored period, 300-600 million years after the Big Bang is when the first stars, black holes, and galaxies are believed to have formed. Many of the observations used by the center originate from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), one of the more powerful telescopes in the world. In the future, the center aims to mainly use the James Webb Space Telescope and the Euclid Telescope of the European Space Agency (ESA). DAWN scientists were instrumental in the construction of three instruments (NIRSpec, MIRI and NIRISS) for the project, and will be involved in the analysis of the first data from the telescope.

====Published research====
As of April 18, 2020, DAWN authors have published at least 187 refereed papers garnering 1602 citations, which, among others, can be found at the NASA/ADS library.
* Observation of inverse Compton emission from a long γ-ray burst:
* Identification of strontium in the merger of two neutron stars:
* Signatures of a jet cocoon in early spectra of a supernova associated with a γ-ray burst:
* Stellar Velocity Dispersion of a Massive Quenching Galaxy at z = 4.01:
==Medal of Honour==
in 2010, the year of the 125th anniversary of the birth of Niels Bohr, the institute established the Niels Bohr Institute Medal of Honour. It is an annual award for &quot;a particularly outstanding researcher who is working in the spirit of Niels Bohr: International cooperation and the exchange of knowledge&quot;.

The medal is made by Danish sculptor Rikke Raben for the Niels Bohr Institute. On the front is a portrait of Niels Bohr, the atom sign and stars. The illustration on the back is inspired by a quote from Bohr: &quot;What is it that we human beings ultimately depend on? We depend on our words. We are suspended in language. Our task is to communicate experience and ideas to others&quot;.
On the back of the medal: &quot;Unity of Knowledge&quot; – the title of a lecture given by Bohr at Columbia University in 1954. &quot;Nosce te ipsum&quot; is Latin and means &quot;know thyself&quot;. This quote originates from the Oracle of Delphi, in the Temple of Apollo in Greece.

<text>DESY, short for Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (English: &quot;German Electron Synchrotron&quot;), is a national research centre for fundamental science located in Hamburg and Zeuthen near Berlin in Germany. It operates particle accelerators used to investigate the structure, dynamics and function of matter, and conducts a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary scientific research in four main areas: particle and high energy physics; photon science; astroparticle physics; and the development, construction and operation of particle accelerators. Its name refers to its first project, an electron synchrotron. DESY is publicly financed by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal States of Hamburg and Brandenburg and is a member of the Helmholtz Association.

== Functions and mission ==
DESY&#x27;s function is to conduct fundamental research for solely civil and peaceful purposes. It specialises in particle accelerator development, construction and operation, particle physics, astroparticle physics and photon science research to explore the fundamental relationships between the structure, dynamics and function of matter. In cooperation with its partner organisations, its photon science research spans surface physics, material science, chemistry, molecular biology, geophysics and medicine through the use of synchrotron radiation and free-electron lasers.

In addition to operating its own large accelerator facilities, DESY participates in many major international research projects, for example the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser in Germany, the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, the Belle II experiment in Japan, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole and the worldwide Cherenkov Telescope Array.

== Sites ==
DESY operates in two locations. The primary location is in the Bahrenfeld quarter of Hamburg. In 1992, DESY expanded to a second site in Zeuthen near Berlin.

=== Hamburg ===
The DESY Hamburg site is located in the quarter Bahrenfeld, in the west of the city in the district of Altona. Its main accelerators are located here.

=== Zeuthen ===
Following German reunification, DESY expanded to a second site in Zeuthen near Berlin. In 1939, the German Postal Ministry founded a nuclear physics laboratory there. After World War II, the laboratory was first named &quot;Institute X&quot;, to become the Institute for High Energy Physics (), the high-energy physics laboratory of the German Democratic Republic belonging to the Academy of Sciences of the GDR. The institute was merged with DESY on 1 January 1992. It focuses on parallel computing for theoretical particle physics, the development and construction of electron sources for X-ray lasers as well as astroparticle physics with a focus on gamma-ray and neutrino astronomy.

== Employees and training ==
DESY employs about 3,000 staff members from more than 60 nations. Most staff work at the Hamburg site, with about 270 at the Zeuthen site. These numbers include more than 130 trainees in various industrial-technical professions and about 500 PhD students and postdocs supervised by DESY. In addition, there are numerous master students from various universities.

== Budget and financing ==
The research centre is a foundation under civil law financed by public funds. In 2020, DESY had an annual budget of about 232 million euros (according to the German federal budget plan, excluding expenditure for investments and special financing expenses). In addition, it had a third-party funding income of about 18 million euros. 90% of the annual budget is provided by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research () and 10% respectively by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg and the German federal state of Brandenburg.

== Particle accelerators and other facilities ==


DESY&#x27;s accelerators were not all built at once, but were rather added one by one to meet the growing demand of the scientists for higher and higher energies to gain more insight into particle structures. In the course of the construction of new accelerators, the older ones were converted to pre-accelerators or to sources for synchrotron radiation for laboratories with new research tasks.

=== DESY ===
The DESY synchrotron (short for &quot;Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron&quot;) has been in operation since 1964. Its circumference is 300 m. It was used until 1978 for particle physics experiments and first measurements with synchrotron radiation. Since then, rebuilt and upgraded several times, it has served as a pre-accelerator and as a test beam facility delivering high-energy particle beams for testing detector systems.

=== DORIS ===
The DORIS storage ring (short for Double Ring Storage Facility) operated from 1974 to 2013. It had a circumference of 289 m. Until 1992, it collided electrons with positrons for particle physics experiments (including the ARGUS experiment). From 1980 on, the synchrotron radiation generated by DORIS was used for photon science experiments; from 1993 to 2012, the storage ring served exclusively as a synchrotron radiation source. The particle physics experiment OLYMPUS then ran in 2012 before DORIS was shut down at the beginning of 2013.

=== PETRA ===
The PETRA storage ring (short for Positron–Electron Tandem Ring Accelerator) has been in operation since 1978. It has a circumference of 2,304 m. Until 1986, electrons and positrons collided in PETRA for research in particle physics (experiments JADE, MARK-J, TASSO and PLUTO). From 1990 on, PETRA served as a pre-accelerator for the HERA storage ring, and from 1995 on also as a synchrotron radiation source with two test experimental stations. Since 2009, the facility has been delivering hard X-ray beams of very high brilliance to over 40 experimental stations under the name PETRA III.

=== HERA ===
The HERA storage ring (short for Hadron–Electron Ring Accelerator) operated from 1992 to 2007. It has a circumference of 6,336 m. It was DESY&#x27;s largest ring accelerator and Germany&#x27;s largest research instrument to date. Until 2007, HERA was the only storage ring facility in the world to enable collisions of electrons or positrons with protons for particle physics (experiments H1, ZEUS, HERMES and HERA-B) for studies of the inner structure of the proton.

=== FLASH ===
The free-electron laser (FEL) FLASH (short for Free-Electron Laser in Hamburg) has been in operation since 2000. It has a length of 315 m. It is based on a test facility for superconducting accelerator technology built in 1997 for the TESLA project and has served as a user facility for experiments with the generated FEL radiation since 2005. FLASH provides ultrashort light pulses in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray range for seven experimental stations and is also used as a test facility for the development of accelerator and FEL technologies.

=== European XFEL accelerator ===
DESY operates the 1.7 km superconducting linear accelerator of the European XFEL X-ray free-electron laser, an international research facility that delivers ultrashort light pulses in the high-energy X-ray range.

=== PITZ ===
Since 2001, the DESY site in Zeuthen has been home to the photoinjector test facility PITZ, a linear accelerator used to study, optimise and prepare the electron sources for FLASH and (since 2015) for the European XFEL.

=== Other facilities ===
The building of the former DORIS storage ring now houses the SINBAD (&quot;Short Innovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY&quot;) accelerator complex with various infrastructures for accelerator R&amp;D: the linear accelerator ARES for accelerator research with ultrashort electron pulses for medical purposes, the AXSIS facility for terahertz-driven acceleration to generate ultrashort X-ray pulses for materials science or medical imaging, and the high-power laser KALDERA for research into laser-driven plasma acceleration.

The LUX facility is also used for research into laser-driven plasma acceleration, the FLASHForward experiment at FLASH for electron-beam-driven plasma acceleration. The relativistic electron beam source REGAE generates ultrashort electron pulses for time-resolved diffraction experiments.

The tunnel of the former HERA storage ring now houses the ALPS II experiment, which uses converted superconducting dipole magnets of the HERA proton ring to study extremely light particles.

=== Computing ===
DESY provides extensive storage and computing capacity for research in all its divisions. As part of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), DESY also operates a Tier-2 computer centre that offers computing and storage systems for the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition, the DESY grid infrastructure is used by other experiments such as Belle II or IceCube. DESY (Hamburg) also provides the Maxwell Cluster, a high-performance computing platform.
== Research areas ==
Research at DESY is organised into four divisions: Accelerators, Photon Science, Particle Physics and Astroparticle Physics.

The Accelerator division develops fundamental technologies for the accelerator facilities that DESY and its partners use in their scientific mission. In addition to the operation and further development of existing facilities (PETRA IV and FLASH2020+ projects, expansion of the European XFEL), essential activities include research into new accelerator concepts, in particular plasma wakefield acceleration, and the improvement of superconducting radio frequency accelerator technology.

In the Photon Science division, photons are being used to study the structure, dynamics and function of matter. To this end, the division develops, builds and operates beamlines and experiments at the DESY light sources PETRA III and FLASH. Every year, more than 3,000 researchers – most of them from universities, but also from non-university research institutions and industry – from over 40 countries conduct experiments at the light sources and in the laboratories at DESY. The research spectrum ranges from basic research to applied research and industrial collaborations in physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, life sciences, earth sciences, materials research as well as the study of cultural heritage.

The Particle Physics division is involved in the large-scale experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva. As part of the international collaborations that run the ATLAS and CMS experiments, DESY contributes to many developments at the LHC, from hardware design and data analysis to preparations for the planned upgrades. DESY also participates in the Belle II experiment at the electron–positron collider SuperKEKB at the research centre KEK in Tsukuba, Japan, as well as in developments for possible future electron–positron linear colliders. It is also active in theoretical particle physics.

The Astroparticle Physics division investigates high-energy processes in the universe. Detectors and telescopes are used to analyse neutrinos and gamma rays from space, which can provide information about cosmic phenomena: black holes, exploding stars and radiation bursts of extreme intensity. To this end, DESY is involved in the gamma telescopes MAGIC, H.E.S.S. and VERITAS as well as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and it contributes to the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). It is the second largest partner in the IceCube observatory at the South Pole.

== History ==
DESY was founded on 18 December 1959 in Hamburg. According to its statutes, DESY&#x27;s mission is &quot;the promotion of basic scientific research [...] in particular through the development, construction and operation of accelerators and their scientific use, in photon science and in the fields of particle and astroparticle physics, as well as through research and development work related thereto&quot;.

From 1959 to 2007, the DESY accelerators were primarily used for particle physics, initially with the eponymous DESY electron synchrotron (1964–present), followed by DORIS (Double Ring Storage Facility, 1974–1992), PETRA (Positron–Electron Tandem Ring Facility, 1978–present) and HERA (Hadron–Electron Ring Accelerator, 1992–2007). In 1987, the ARGUS experiment at DORIS was the first to observe a large mixing of B mesons and thus a process in which matter and antimatter behave differently. The most important discovery of the experiments TASSO, JADE, MARK-J and PLUTO at PETRA was the detection of the gluon, the messenger particle of the strong force, in 1979. From 1990, PETRA served as a pre-accelerator for the even larger storage ring HERA with its four experiments H1, ZEUS, HERMES and HERA-B. HERA was the only storage ring facility in the world in which protons collided with electrons or positrons. In these collisions, the point-like electron acted like a probe, scanning the inner structure of the proton and making it visible with high resolution. HERA&#x27;s precise insights into the interior of the proton formed the basis for numerous other particle physics experiments, especially at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the research centre CERN and for numerous developments in theoretical particle physics.

In parallel, as early as the 1960s, research groups from DESY, various universities and the Max Planck Society developed the technology for using the synchrotron radiation produced by the accelerators. To meet the rapidly growing national and European demand, DESY founded its own large laboratory: the Hamburg Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory HASYLAB, which opened in 1980. It provided measuring stations at DORIS, and it was here that the Israeli biochemist Ada Yonath (Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009) conducted experiments from 1986 to 2004 that led to her deciphering the ribosome. From 1995, both synchrotron radiation and particle physics experiments were conducted at PETRA. In 2009, the PETRA facility was upgraded for exclusive use as a synchrotron radiation source for hard X-rays (PETRA III). Today, PETRA III serves over 40 experimental stations, and there are plans to expand it into the PETRA IV 3D X-ray microscope. With the shutdown of DORIS in early 2013, the name HASYLAB was abandoned, and the use of DESY&#x27;s light sources has since been carried out in its Photon Science division.

In the early 1990s, DESY began to develop a new technology: radio frequency accelerator technology based on superconducting cavities made of niobium, which are cooled to approximately 2 K (−271 °C) with liquid helium. The first accelerator on this basis was a test facility for superconducting linear accelerators at DESY to test the principle of self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) of X-ray laser light. The SASE theory was developed and refined at DESY and at institutes in Russia, Italy and the USA from 1980 onwards. In 2000 to 2001, the test facility at DESY was the first free-electron laser in the world to produce light flashes in the vacuum ultraviolet and soft X-ray range. Today, the FLASH facility produces ultrashort light pulses in the soft X-ray range for seven experimental stations. Since 2020, it has been expanded to further optimise the properties of the radiation (FLASH2020+ project).

From 2009 to 2016, an international consortium led by DESY developed the European X-ray free-electron laser European XFEL. The international research facility, which involves 12 European shareholder countries, is operated by the non-profit company European XFEL GmbH. The core of the facility is a 1.7 km superconducting linear accelerator. With an electron energy of 17.5 GeV, it is the most powerful superconducting linear accelerator in the world to date. DESY operates the accelerator on behalf of European XFEL GmbH.

Since 2010, DESY has been developing plasma-based accelerator technology (both laser- and electron-beam-driven) as a possible alternative to conventional accelerator technologies, with the aim of enabling compact accelerators for photon science, particle physics as well as medical and industrial applications.

== Chairpersons of the DESY Directorate ==

<text>Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is a United States Department of Energy national laboratory located in Upton, New York, a hamlet of the Town of Brookhaven. It was formally established in 1947 at the site of Camp Upton, a former U.S. Army base on Long Island. Located approximately 60 miles east of New York City, it is managed by Stony Brook University and Battelle Memorial Institute.

Research at BNL includes nuclear and high energy physics, energy science and technology, environmental and bioscience, nanoscience, and national security. The 5,300 acre campus contains several large research facilities, including the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and National Synchrotron Light Source II. Seven Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work conducted at Brookhaven Lab.

==Overview==
BNL operations are overseen by a Department of Energy Site office, is staffed by approximately 2,750 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support personnel, and hosts 4,000 guest investigators every year. The laboratory is guarded by a Department of Energy Protective Force, has a full service fire department, and has its own ZIP code (11973). In total, the lab spans a area that is mostly coterminous with the hamlet of Upton, New York. BNL is served by a rail spur operated as-needed by the New York and Atlantic Railway. Co-located with the laboratory is the New York, NY, weather forecast office of the National Weather Service.

===Major programs===

Although originally conceived as a nuclear research facility, Brookhaven Lab&#x27;s mission has greatly expanded. Its foci are now:
* Nuclear and high-energy physics
* Physics and chemistry of materials
* Environmental and climate research
* Nanomaterials
* Energy research
* Nonproliferation
* Structural biology
* Accelerator physics

===Operation===
Brookhaven National Lab was originally owned by the Atomic Energy Commission and is now owned by that agency&#x27;s successor, the United States Department of Energy (DOE). DOE subcontracts the research and operation to universities and research organizations. It is currently operated by Brookhaven Science Associates LLC, which is an equal partnership of Stony Brook University and Battelle Memorial Institute. From 1947 to 1998, it was operated by Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), but AUI lost its contract in the wake of two incidents: a 1994 fire at the facility&#x27;s high-flux beam reactor that exposed several workers to radiation and reports in 1997 of a tritium leak into the groundwater of the Long Island Central Pine Barrens on which the facility sits.

==History==

===Foundations===
Following World War II, the US Atomic Energy Commission was created to support government-sponsored peacetime research on atomic energy. The effort to build a nuclear reactor in the American northeast was fostered largely by physicists Isidor Isaac Rabi and Norman Foster Ramsey Jr., who during the war witnessed many of their colleagues at Columbia University leave for new remote research sites following the departure of the Manhattan Project from its campus. Their effort to house this reactor near New York City was rivalled by a similar effort at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to have a facility near Boston. Involvement was quickly solicited from representatives of northeastern universities to the south and west of New York City such that this city would be at their geographic center. In March 1946 a nonprofit corporation was established that consisted of representatives from nine major research universities — Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, University of Rochester, and Yale University.
Out of 17 considered sites in the Boston-Washington corridor, Camp Upton on Long Island was eventually chosen as the most suitable in consideration of space, transportation, and availability. The camp had been a training center for the US Army during both World War I and World War II, and a Japanese internment camp during the latter. Following the war, Camp Upton was no longer needed, and a plan was conceived to convert the military camp into a research facility.

On March 21, 1947, the Camp Upton site was officially transferred from the U.S. War Department to the new U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), predecessor to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

===Research and facilities===
====Reactor history====
In 1947 construction began on the first nuclear reactor at Brookhaven, the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor. This reactor, which opened in 1950, was the first reactor to be constructed in the United States after World War II. The High Flux Beam Reactor operated from 1965 to 1999. In 1959 Brookhaven built the first US reactor specifically tailored to medical research, the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor, which operated until 2000.

====Accelerator history====
In 1952 Brookhaven began using its first particle accelerator, the Cosmotron. At the time the Cosmotron was the world&#x27;s highest energy accelerator, being the first to impart more than 1 GeV of energy to a particle. The Cosmotron was retired in 1966, after it was superseded in 1960 by the new Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). The AGS was used in research that resulted in three Nobel Prizes, including the discovery of the muon neutrino, the charm quark, and CP violation.

In 1970 in BNL started the ISABELLE project to develop and build two proton intersecting storage rings. The groundbreaking for the project was in October 1978. In 1981, with the tunnel for the accelerator already excavated, problems with the superconducting magnets needed for the ISABELLE accelerator brought the project to a halt, and the project was eventually cancelled in 1983.

The National Synchrotron Light Source operated from 1982 to 2014 and was involved with two Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. It has since been replaced by the National Synchrotron Light Source II.

After ISABELLE&#x27;S cancellation, physicist at BNL proposed that the excavated tunnel and parts of the magnet assembly be used in another accelerator. In 1984 the first proposal for the accelerator now known as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) was put forward. The construction got funded in 1991 and RHIC has been operational since 2000. One of the world&#x27;s only two operating heavy-ion colliders, RHIC is as of 2010 the second-highest-energy collider after the Large Hadron Collider. RHIC is housed in a tunnel 2.4 miles (3.9 km) long and is visible from space.

On January 9, 2020, It was announced by Paul Dabbar, undersecretary of the US Department of Energy Office of Science, that the BNL eRHIC design has been selected over the conceptual design put forward by Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility as the future Electron–ion collider (EIC) in the United States. In addition to the site selection, it was announced that the BNL EIC had acquired CD-0 (mission need) from the Department of Energy. BNL&#x27;s eRHIC design proposes upgrading the existing Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which collides beams light to heavy ions including polarized protons, with a polarized electron facility, to be housed in the same tunnel.

====Other discoveries====

In 1958, Brookhaven scientists created one of the world&#x27;s first video games, &quot;Tennis for Two&quot;.

In 1967, Brookhaven scientists patented Maglev, a transportation technology that utilizes magnetic levitation.

In 2024, Brookhaven National Laboratories scientists discovered a new kind of antimatter nucleus.

==Major facilities==
* Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which was designed to research quark–gluon plasma and the sources of proton spin. Until 2009 it was the world&#x27;s most powerful heavy ion collider. It is the only collider of spin-polarized protons.
* Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), used for the study of nanoscale materials.
* National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), Brookhaven&#x27;s newest user facility, opened in 2015 to replace the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), which had operated for 30 years. NSLS was involved in the work that won the 2003 and 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
* Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, a particle accelerator that was used in three of the lab&#x27;s Nobel prizes.
* Accelerator Test Facility, generates, accelerates and monitors particle beams.
* Tandem Van de Graaff, once the world&#x27;s largest electrostatic accelerator.
* Computational Science resources, including access to a massively parallel Blue Gene series supercomputer that is among the fastest in the world for scientific research, run jointly by Brookhaven National Laboratory and Stony Brook University.
* Interdisciplinary Science Building, with unique laboratories for studying high-temperature superconductors and other materials important for addressing energy challenges.
* NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, where scientists use beams of ions to simulate cosmic rays and assess the risks of space radiation to human space travelers and equipment.

==Off-site contributions==
It is a contributing partner to ATLAS experiment, one of the four detectors located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is currently operating at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.

Brookhaven was also responsible for the design of the SNS accumulator ring in partnership with Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Brookhaven plays a role in a range of neutrino research projects around the world, including the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment in China and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.

==Public access==

For other than approved Public Events, the Laboratory is closed to the general public. The lab is open to the public on several Sundays during the summer for tours and special programs. The public access program is referred to as &#x27;Summer Sundays&#x27; and takes place in July, and features a science show and a tour of the lab&#x27;s major facilities. The laboratory also hosts science fairs, science bowls, and robotics competitions for local schools, and lectures, concerts, and scientific talks for the local community. The Lab estimates that each year it enhances the science education of roughly 35,000 K-12 students on Long Island, more than 200 undergraduates, and 550 teachers from across the United States.

== Environmental cleanup ==
In January 1997, ground water samples taken by BNL staff revealed concentrations of tritium that were twice the allowable federal drinking water standards—some samples taken later were 32 times the standard. The tritium was found to be leaking from the laboratory&#x27;s High Flux Beam Reactor&#x27;s spent-fuel pool into the aquifer that provides drinking water for nearby Suffolk County residents.

DOE&#x27;s and BNL&#x27;s investigation of this incident concluded that the tritium had been leaking for as long as 12 years without DOE&#x27;s or BNL&#x27;s knowledge. Installing wells that could have detected the leak was first discussed by BNL engineers in 1993, but the wells were not completed until 1996. The resulting controversy about both BNL&#x27;s handling of the tritium leak and perceived lapses in DOE&#x27;s oversight led to the termination of AUI as the BNL contractor in May 1997.

The responsibility for failing to discover Brookhaven&#x27;s tritium leak has been acknowledged by laboratory managers, and DOE admits it failed to properly oversee the laboratory&#x27;s operations. Brookhaven officials repeatedly treated the need for installing monitoring wells that would have detected the tritium leak as a low priority despite public concern and the laboratory&#x27;s agreement to follow local environmental regulations. DOE&#x27;s on-site oversight office, the Brookhaven Group, was directly responsible for Brookhaven&#x27;s performance, but it failed to hold the laboratory accountable for meeting all of its regulatory commitments, especially its agreement to install monitoring wells. Senior DOE leadership also shared responsibility because they failed to put in place an effective system that encourages all parts of DOE to work together to ensure that contractors meet their responsibilities on environmental, safety and health issues. Unclear responsibilities for environment, safety and health matters has been a recurring problem for DOE management.

Since 1993, DOE has spent more than US$580 million on remediating soil and groundwater contamination at the lab site and completed several high-profile projects. These include the decommissioning and decontamination of the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor, removal of mercury-contaminated sediment from the Peconic River, and installation and operation of 16 on- and off-site groundwater treatment systems that have cleaned more than 25 billion gallons of groundwater since 1996.

Shortly after winning the contract to operate the lab in 1997, BSA formed a Community Advisory Council (CAC) to advise the laboratory director on cleanup projects and other items of interest to the community. The CAC represents a diverse range of interests and values of individuals and groups who are interested in or affected by the actions of the Laboratory. It consists of representatives from 26 local business, civic, education, environment, employee, government, and health organizations. The CAC sets its own agenda, brings forth issues important to the community, and works to provide consensus recommendations to Laboratory management.

<text>SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, originally named the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, is a federally funded research and development center in Menlo Park, California, United States. Founded in 1962, the laboratory is now sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and administrated by Stanford University. It is the site of the Stanford Linear Accelerator, a 3.2 kilometer (2-mile) linear accelerator constructed in 1966 that could accelerate electrons to energies of 50 GeV.

Today SLAC research centers on a broad program in atomic and solid-state physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine using X-rays from synchrotron radiation and a free-electron laser as well as experimental and theoretical research in elementary particle physics, accelerator physics, astroparticle physics, and cosmology. The laboratory is under the programmatic direction of the United States Department of Energy Office of Science.

==History==
Founded in 1962 as the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, the facility is located on of Stanford University-owned land on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California, just west of the university&#x27;s main campus. The main accelerator is long, making it the longest linear accelerator in the world, and has been operational since 1966.
Research at SLAC has produced three Nobel Prizes in Physics:
*1976: The charm quark; see J/ψ meson
*1990: Quark structure inside protons and neutrons
*1995: The tau lepton

SLAC&#x27;s meeting facilities also provided a venue for the Homebrew Computer Club and other pioneers of the home computer revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In 1984, the laboratory was named an ASME National Historic Engineering Landmark and an IEEE Milestone.

SLAC developed and, in December 1991, began hosting the first World Wide Web server outside of Europe.

In the early-to-mid 1990s, the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) investigated the properties of the Z boson using the Stanford Large Detector.

As of 2005, SLAC employed over 1,000 people, some 150 of whom were physicists with doctorate degrees, and served over 3,000 visiting researchers yearly, operating particle accelerators for high-energy physics and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) for synchrotron light radiation research, which was &quot;indispensable&quot; in the research leading to the 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to Stanford Professor Roger D. Kornberg.

In October 2008, the Department of Energy announced that the center&#x27;s name would be changed to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The reasons given include a better representation of the new direction of the lab and the ability to trademark the laboratory&#x27;s name. Stanford University had legally opposed the Department of Energy&#x27;s attempt to trademark &quot;Stanford Linear Accelerator Center&quot;.

In March 2009, it was announced that the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory was to receive $68.3 million in Recovery Act Funding to be disbursed by Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science.

In October 2016, Bits and Watts launched as a collaboration between SLAC and Stanford University to design &quot;better, greener electric grids&quot;. SLAC later pulled out over concerns about an industry partner, the state-owned Chinese electric utility.

In April of 2024, SLAC completed two decades of work constructing the world&#x27;s largest digital camera for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) project at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. The camera is expected to become operational in 2025.

== Components ==
=== Accelerator ===

The main accelerator was an RF linear accelerator that accelerated electrons and positrons up to 50 GeV. At long, the accelerator was the longest linear accelerator in the world, and was claimed to be &quot;the world&#x27;s most straight object.&quot; until 2017 when the European x-ray free electron laser opened. The main accelerator is buried below ground and passes underneath Interstate Highway 280. The above-ground klystron gallery atop the beamline, was the longest building in the United States until the LIGO project&#x27;s twin interferometers were completed in 1999. It is easily distinguishable from the air and is marked as a visual waypoint on aeronautical charts.

A portion of the original linear accelerator is now part of the Linac Coherent Light Source.

=== Stanford Linear Collider ===
The Stanford Linear Collider was a linear accelerator that collided electrons and positrons at SLAC. The center of mass energy was about 90 GeV, equal to the mass of the Z boson, which the accelerator was designed to study.
Grad student Barrett D. Milliken discovered the first Z event on 12 April 1989 while poring over the previous day&#x27;s computer data from the Mark II detector. The bulk of the data was collected by the SLAC Large Detector, which came online in 1991. Although largely overshadowed by the Large Electron–Positron Collider at CERN, which began running in 1989, the highly polarized electron beam at SLC (close to 80%) made certain unique measurements possible, such as parity violation in Z Boson-b quark coupling.

Presently no beam enters the south and north arcs in the machine, which leads to the Final Focus, therefore this section is mothballed to run beam into the PEP2 section from the beam switchyard.
=== SLAC Large Detector ===
The SLAC Large Detector (SLD) was the main detector for the Stanford Linear Collider. It was designed primarily to detect Z bosons produced by the accelerator&#x27;s electron-positron collisions. Built in 1991, the SLD operated from 1992 to 1998.

=== PEP ===
PEP (Positron-Electron Project) began operation in 1980, with center-of-mass energies up to 29 GeV. At its apex, PEP had five large particle detectors in operation, as well as a sixth smaller detector. About 300 researchers made used of PEP. PEP stopped operating in 1990, and PEP-II began construction in 1994.

=== PEP-II ===
From 1999 to 2008, the main purpose of the linear accelerator was to inject electrons and positrons into the PEP-II accelerator, an electron-positron collider with a pair of storage rings in circumference. PEP-II was host to the BaBar experiment, one of the so-called B-Factory experiments studying charge-parity symmetry.

=== Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource ===
The Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) is a synchrotron light user facility located on the SLAC campus. Originally built for particle physics, it was used in experiments where the J/ψ meson was discovered. It is now used exclusively for materials science and biology experiments which take advantage of the high-intensity synchrotron radiation emitted by the stored electron beam to study the structure of molecules. In the early 1990s, an independent electron injector was built for this storage ring, allowing it to operate independently of the main linear accelerator.
=== Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope ===
SLAC plays a primary role in the mission and operation of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, launched in August 2008. The principal scientific objectives of this mission are:
*To understand the mechanisms of particle acceleration in AGNs, pulsars, and SNRs.
*To resolve the gamma-ray sky: unidentified sources and diffuse emission.
*To determine the high-energy behavior of gamma-ray bursts and transients.
*To probe dark matter and fundamental physics.

=== KIPAC ===
The Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) is partially housed on the grounds of SLAC, in addition to its presence on the main Stanford campus.

===PULSE===
The Stanford PULSE Institute (PULSE) is a Stanford Independent Laboratory located in the Central Laboratory at SLAC. PULSE was created by Stanford in 2005 to help Stanford faculty and SLAC scientists develop ultrafast x-ray research at LCLS. PULSE research publications can be viewed here.

=== LCLS ===
The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is a free electron laser facility located at SLAC. The LCLS is partially a reconstruction of the last 1/3 of the original linear accelerator at SLAC, and can deliver extremely intense x-ray radiation for research in a number of areas. It achieved first lasing in April 2009.

The laser produces hard X-rays, 109 times the relative brightness of traditional synchrotron sources and is the most powerful x-ray source in the world. LCLS enables a variety of new experiments and provides enhancements for existing experimental methods. Often, x-rays are used to take &quot;snapshots&quot; of objects at the atomic level before obliterating samples. The laser&#x27;s wavelength, ranging from 6.2 to 0.13 nm (200 to 9500 electron volts (eV)) is similar to the width of an atom, providing extremely detailed information that was previously unattainable. Additionally, the laser is capable of capturing images with a &quot;shutter speed&quot; measured in femtoseconds, or million-billionths of a second, necessary because the intensity of the beam is often high enough so that the sample explodes on the femtosecond timescale.

===LCLS-II===
The LCLS-II project is to provide a major upgrade to LCLS by adding two new X-ray laser beams. The new system will utilize the of existing tunnel to add a new superconducting accelerator at 4 GeV and two new sets of undulators that will increase the available energy range of LCLS. The advancement from the discoveries using this new capabilities may include new drugs, next-generation computers, and new materials.

===FACET===
In 2012, the first two-thirds (~2 km) of the original SLAC LINAC were recommissioned for a new user facility, the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET). This facility was capable of delivering 20 GeV, 3 nC electron (and positron) beams with short bunch lengths and small spot sizes, ideal for beam-driven plasma acceleration studies. The facility ended operations in 2016 for the constructions of LCLS-II which will occupy the first third of the SLAC LINAC. The FACET-II project will re-establish electron and positron beams in the middle third of the LINAC for the continuation of beam-driven plasma acceleration studies in 2019.

===NLCTA===
The Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA) is a 60-120 MeV high-brightness electron beam linear accelerator used for experiments on advanced beam manipulation and acceleration techniques. It is located at SLAC&#x27;s end station B. A list of relevant research publications can be viewed here .

===Theoretical Physics===
SLAC also performs theoretical research in elementary particle physics, including in areas of quantum field theory, collider physics, astroparticle physics, and particle phenomenology.

== Other discoveries ==
*SLAC has also been instrumental in the development of the klystron, a high-power microwave amplification tube.
*There is active research on plasma acceleration with recent successes such as the doubling of the energy of 42 GeV electrons in a meter-scale accelerator.
*There was a &quot;Paleoparadoxia&quot; found at the SLAC site, and its skeleton can be seen at a small museum there in the Breezeway.
*The SSRL facility was used to reveal hidden text in the Archimedes Palimpsest. X-rays from the synchrotron radiation lightsource caused the iron in the original ink to glow, allowing the researchers to photograph the original document that a Christian monk had scrubbed off.

<text>Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), located in Batavia, Illinois, near Chicago, is a United States Department of Energy national laboratory specializing in high-energy particle physics.

Fermilab&#x27;s Main Injector, two miles (3.3 km) in circumference, is the laboratory&#x27;s most powerful particle accelerator. The accelerator complex that feeds the Main Injector is under upgrade, and construction of the first building for the new PIP-II linear accelerator began in 2020. Until 2011, Fermilab was the home of the 6.28 km (3.90 mi) circumference Tevatron accelerator. The ring-shaped tunnels of the Tevatron and the Main Injector are visible from the air and by satellite.

Fermilab aims to become a world center in neutrino physics. It is the host of the multi-billion dollar Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) now under construction. The project has suffered delays and, in 2022, the journals &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Scientific American&quot; each published articles describing the project as &quot;troubled&quot;.
Ongoing neutrino experiments are ICARUS (Imaging Cosmic and Rare Underground Signals) and NOνA (NuMI Off-Axis νe Appearance). Completed neutrino experiments include MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search), MINOS+, MiniBooNE and SciBooNE (SciBar Booster Neutrino Experiment) and MicroBooNE (Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment).

On-site experiments outside of the neutrino program include the SeaQuest fixed-target experiment and Muon g-2. Fermilab continues to participate in the work at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC); it serves as a Tier 1 site in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. Fermilab also pursues research in quantum information science. It founded the Fermilab Quantum Institute in 2019. Since 2020, it also is home to the SQMS (Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems) Center.

Due to serious performance issues over the period of a decade, the Department of Energy established new management for Fermilab on January 1, 2025. Fermilab is currently managed by the Fermi Forward Discovery Group, LLC (FFDG). This consortium is led by the 2007-2024 management group, the Fermi Research Alliance (FRA), with Amentum Environment &amp; Energy, Inc., and Longenecker &amp; Associates as new additions. Due to the management crisis, the Director of the Laboratory, Lea Merminga, resigned on January 13, 2025 and is temporarily replaced by Acting Director Young-Kee Kim, from the University of Chicago.

Fermilab is a part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor. Argonne National Laboratory, which is another US DOE national laboratory located approximately 20 miles away.

Asteroid 11998 Fermilab is named in honor of the laboratory.

==History==
Weston, Illinois, was a community next to Batavia voted out of existence by its village board in 1966 to provide a site for Fermilab.

The laboratory was founded in 1969 as the National Accelerator Laboratory; it was renamed in honor of Enrico Fermi in 1974. The laboratory&#x27;s first director was Robert Rathbun Wilson, under whom the laboratory opened ahead of time and under budget. Many of the sculptures on the site are of his creation. He is the namesake of the site&#x27;s high-rise laboratory building, whose unique shape has become the symbol for Fermilab and which is the center of activity on the campus.

After Wilson stepped down in 1978 to protest the lack of funding for the lab, Leon M. Lederman took on the job. It was under his guidance that the original accelerator was replaced with the Tevatron, an accelerator capable of colliding protons and antiprotons at a combined energy of 1.96 TeV. Lederman stepped down in 1989 and remained director emeritus until his death. The science education center at the site was named in his honor.

The later directors are:
* John Peoples, 1989 to 1999
* Michael S. Witherell, July 1999 to June 2005
* Piermaria Oddone, July 2005 to July 2013
* Nigel Lockyer, September 2013 to April 2022
* Lia Merminga, April 2022 to January 2025
* Young-Kee Kim (interim), January 2025 to present 

==Accelerators==
===Tevatron===
Prior to the startup in 2008 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland, the Tevatron was the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, accelerating protons and antiprotons to energies of 980 GeV, and producing proton-antiproton collisions with energies of up to 1.96 TeV, the first accelerator to reach one &quot;tera-electron-volt&quot; energy. At , it was the world&#x27;s fourth-largest particle accelerator in circumference. One of its most important achievements was the 1995 discovery of the top quark, announced by research teams using the Tevatron&#x27;s CDF and DØ detectors. It was shut down in 2011.

===Fermilab Accelerator Complex===
Since 2013, the first stage in the acceleration process (pre-accelerator injector) in the Fermilab chain of accelerators takes place in two ion sources which ionize hydrogen gas. The gas is introduced into a container lined with molybdenum electrodes, each a matchbox-sized, oval-shaped cathode and a surrounding anode, separated by 1 mm and held in place by glass ceramic insulators. A cavity magnetron generates a plasma to form the ions near the metal surface. The ions are accelerated by the source to 35 keV and matched by low energy beam transport (LEBT) into the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) which applies a 750 keV electrostatic field giving the ions their second acceleration. At the exit of RFQ, the beam is matched by medium energy beam transport (MEBT) into the entrance of the linear accelerator (linac).

The next stage of acceleration is a linear particle accelerator (linac). This stage consists of two segments. The first segment has five drift tube cavities, operating at 201 MHz. The second stage has seven side-coupled cavities, operating at 805 MHz. At the end of linac, the particles are accelerated to 400 MeV, or about 70% of the speed of light. Immediately before entering the next accelerator, the H− ions pass through a carbon foil, becoming H+ ions (protons).

The resulting protons then enter the booster ring, a circumference circular accelerator whose magnets bend beams of protons around a circular path. The protons travel around the Booster about 20,000 times in 33 milliseconds, adding energy with each revolution until they leave the Booster accelerated to 8 GeV. In 2021, the lab announced that its latest superconducting YBCO magnet could increase field strength at a rate of 290 tesla per second, reaching a peak magnetic field strength of around 0.5 tesla.

The final acceleration is applied by the Main Injector [circumference ], which is the smaller of the two rings in the last picture below (foreground). Completed in 1999, it has become Fermilab&#x27;s &quot;particle switchyard&quot; in that it can route protons to any of the experiments installed along the beam lines after accelerating them to 120 GeV. Until 2011, the Main Injector provided protons to the antiproton ring [circumference ] and the Tevatron for further acceleration but now provides the last push before the particles reach the beam line experiments.

===Proton improvement plan===
Recognizing higher demands of proton beams to support new experiments, Fermilab began to improve their accelerators in 2011. Expected to continue for many years, the project has two phases: Proton Improvement Plan (PIP) and Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II).

;PIP (2011–2018)
The overall goals of PIP are to increase the repetition rate of the Booster beam from 7 Hz to 15 Hz and replace old hardware to increase reliability of the operation. Before the start of the PIP project, a replacement of the pre-accelerator injector was underway. The replacement of almost 40 year-old Cockcroft–Walton generators to RFQ started in 2009 and completed in 2012. At the Linac stage, the analog beam position monitor (BPM) modules were replaced with digital boards in 2013. A replacement of Linac vacuum pumps and related hardware is expected to be completed in 2015. A study on the replacement of 201 MHz drift tubes is still ongoing. At the boosting stage, a major component of the PIP is to upgrade the Booster ring to 15 Hz operation. The Booster has 19 radio frequency stations. Originally, the Booster stations were operating without solid-state drive system which was acceptable for 7 Hz but not 15 Hz operation. A demonstration project in 2004 converted one of the stations to solid state drive before the PIP project. As part of the project, the remaining stations were converted to solid state in 2013. Another major part of the PIP project is to refurbish and replace 40 year-old Booster cavities. Many cavities have been refurbished and tested to operate at 15 Hz. The completion of cavity refurbishment is expected in 2015, after which the repetition rate can be gradually increased to 15 Hz operation. A longer term upgrade is to replace the Booster cavities with a new design. The research and development of the new cavities is underway, with replacement expected in 2018.

;PIP-II
The goals of PIP-II include a plan to delivery 1.2 MW of proton beam power from the Main Injector to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment target at 120 GeV and the power near 1 MW at 60 GeV with a possibility to extend the power to 2 MW in the future. The plan should also support the current 8 GeV experiments including Mu2e, Muon g−2, and other short-baseline neutrino experiments. These require an upgrade to the Linac to inject to the Booster with 800 MeV. The first option considered was to add 400 MeV &quot;afterburner&quot; superconducting Linac at the tail end of the existing 400 MeV. This would have required moving the existing Linac up . However, there were many technical issues with this approach. Instead, Fermilab is building a new 800 MeV superconducting Linac to inject to the Booster ring.

Construction of the first building for the PIP-II accelerator began in 2020. The new Linac site will be located on top of a small portion of Tevatron near the Booster ring in order to take advantage of existing electrical and water, and cryogenic infrastructure. The PIP-II Linac will have low energy beam transport line (LEBT), radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ), and medium energy beam transport line (MEBT) operated at the room temperature at with a 162.5 MHz and energy increasing from 0.03 MeV. The first segment of Linac will be operated at 162.5 MHz and energy increased up to 11 MeV. The second segment of Linac will be operated at 325 MHz and energy increased up to 177 MeV. The last segment of linac will be operated at 650 MHz and will have the final energy level of 800 MeV.

As of 2022, the estimated PIP-II accelerator start date for the accelerator is 2028. The project was approved for construction in April 2022 with an expected cost to the Department of Energy of $978M and with an additional $330M in contributions from international partners.

==Experiments==
===Discoveries by Fermilab experiments===
The following particles were first directly observed at Fermilab:

* The top quark announced in 1995 by the DØ experiment and CDF experiment.
* The bottom quark, which was observed as a quark-antiquark pair called the Upsilon meson announced in 1977 by Experiment 228.
* The tau neutrino, announced in July 2000 by the DONUT collaboration.
* The bottom Omega baryon (), announced by the DØ experiment of Fermilab in 2008.

In 1999, physicists at on the KTeV experiment were also the first to observe direct CP violation in kaon decays.

The DØ experiment and CDF experiment each made important contributions to the observation of the Higgs Boson, announced in 2012.

===Evolution of the post-Tevatron experimental program===
Fermilab dismantled the CDF (Collider Detector at Fermilab) experiment to make the space available for IARC (Illinois Accelerator Research Center).

Fermilab physicists continue to play a key role in the world-wide collider program.
The LHC Physics Center (LPC) at Fermilab is a regional center of the Compact Muon Solenoid Collaboration (the experiment is housed at CERN). The LPC offers a vibrant community of CMS scientists from the US and plays a major role in the CMS detector commissioning, and in the design and development of the detector upgrade. Fermilab is the host laboratory for USCMS, which includes researchers from 50 U.S. universities including 715 students. Fermilab hosts the largest CMS Tier 1 computing center, handling approximately 40% of global CMS Tier 1 computing requests. On February 9, 2022, Fermilab&#x27;s Patricia McBride (physicist) was elected spokesperson of the CMS collaboration.

During this time-frame, the laboratory also established a new program in research in cutting-edge information science, including the development of quantum teleportation technology for the quantum internet and increasing the lifetime of superconducting resonators for use in quantum computers.

===On-site program in the 2020s===
The on-site program in the 2020s is largely focused on the &quot;Intensity Frontier&quot; of particle physics, especially neutrino physics and rare physics searches using muons. A program exploring nucleon structure is also continuing.

====LBNF/DUNE====
Fermilab strives to become the world leader in neutrino physics through the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility. Other leaders are CERN, which leads in Accelerator physics with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and Japan, which has been approved to build and lead the International Linear Collider (ILC). Fermilab will be the site of LBNF&#x27;s future beamline, and the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), in Lead, SD, is the site selected to house the massive far detector. The term &quot;baseline&quot; refers to the distance between the neutrino source and the detector. The far detector current design is for four modules of instrumented liquid argon with a fiducial volume of 10 kilotons each.

According to the 2016 Conceptual Design Report, the first two modules were expected to be complete in 2024, with the beam operational in 2026. The final modules were planned to be operational in 2027. In 2022, the cost for two far detector modules and the beam, alone, had risen to $3B. This led to a decision by the Department of Energy Office of Science to phase the experiment. Phase I would consist of two modules, to be completed in 2028–29, and the beamline, to be completed in 2032. The installation of phase II, the remaining two far detector modules, is not yet planned and will be at a cost above the $3B estimate for phase I.

A large prototype detector constructed at CERN took data with a test beam from 2018 to 2020. The results show that ProtoDUNE performed with greater than 99% efficiency.

LBNF/DUNE program in neutrino physics plans to measure fundamental physical parameters with high precision and to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. The measurements DUNE will make are expected to greatly increase the physics community&#x27;s understanding of neutrinos and their role in the universe, thereby better elucidating the nature of matter and anti-matter. It will send the world&#x27;s highest-intensity neutrino beam to a near detector on the Fermilab site and the far detector 800 miles (1300 km) away at SURF.

====About other neutrino experiments====
The MiniBooNE detector was a diameter sphere containing 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1,520 phototube detectors. An estimated 1 million neutrino events were recorded each year. SciBooNE sat in the same neutrino beam as MiniBooNE but had fine-grained tracking capabilities. The NOνA experiment uses, and the MINOS experiment used, Fermilab&#x27;s NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam, which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels through the Earth to the Soudan Mine in Minnesota and the Ash River, Minnesota, site of the NOνA far detector. In 2017, the ICARUS neutrino experiment was moved from CERN to Fermilab.

====Muon g−2====
Muon g−2: (pronounced &quot;gee minus two&quot;) is a particle physics experiment to measure the anomaly of the magnetic moment of a muon to a precision of 0.14 ppm, which will be a sensitive test of the Standard Model.
Fermilab is continuing an experiment conducted at Brookhaven National Laboratory to measure the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon.

The magnetic dipole moment (&quot;g&quot;) of a charged lepton (electron, muon, or tau) is very nearly 2. The difference from 2 (the &quot;anomalous&quot; part) depends on the lepton, and can be computed quite exactly based on the current Standard Model of particle physics. Measurements of the electron are in excellent agreement with this computation. The Brookhaven experiment did this measurement for muons, a much more technically difficult measurement due to their short lifetime, and detected a tantalizing, but not definitive, 3 &quot;σ&quot; discrepancy between the measured value and the computed one.

The Brookhaven experiment ended in 2001, but 10 years later Fermilab acquired the equipment, and is working to make a more accurate measurement (smaller &quot;σ&quot;) which will either eliminate the discrepancy or, hopefully, confirm it as an experimentally observable example of physics beyond the Standard Model.

Central to the experiment is a 50 foot-diameter superconducting magnet with an exceptionally uniform magnetic field. This was transported, in one piece, from Brookhaven in Long Island, New York, to Fermilab in the summer of 2013. The move traversed 3,200 miles over 35 days, mostly on a barge down the East Coast and up the Mississippi.

The magnet was refurbished and powered on in September 2015, and has been confirmed to have the same (0.13%) p-p basic magnetic field uniformity that it had before the move.

The project worked on shimming the magnet to improve its magnetic field uniformity. This had been done at Brookhaven, but was disturbed by the move and had to be re-done at Fermilab.

In 2018, the experiment started taking data at Fermilab. In 2021, the laboratory reported that results from initial study involving the particle challenged the Standard Model, with the potential for discovery of new forces and particles.

In August 2023, the Fermilab group said they may be getting closer to proving the existence of a new force of nature. They have found more evidence that sub-atomic particles, called muons, are not behaving in the way predicted by the current theory of sub-atomic physics.

==Delays, cost overruns, safety failures, and management turmoil in the 2010s and 2020s==
Starting in the 2010s, delays and cost over-runs led to substantial concerns about mismanagement of the laboratory.

===Oversight issues that developed between 2014 and 2024===
In 2014, the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (&quot;P5&quot;) recommended three major initiatives for construction on the Fermilab site. Two were particle physics experiments: the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment and Mu2e. The third was the PIPII accelerator upgrade described above. Also, P5 recommended Fermilab participation in LHC at CERN.

As of 2022, two P5-recommended Fermilab projects had suffered substantial delays:
* The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment with the enabling Long Baseline Neutrino Facility was proposed to P5 as a $1B project; the cost estimate in 2021 dollars was more than $3B, with far detector operations beginning 2029 and full operation by 2032.
* The Mu2e experiment was to produce preliminary results in 2020, but this is now delayed until 2026.

Even smaller experiments, below the cost-level of individual P5 approval, that were proposed at the time of the 2014 P5 suffered considerable delay. The Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) that was proposed in 2014 with a $10M cost scale was originally scheduled for data taking in spring 2018, but is now scheduled to begin in autumn 2023.

The Department of Energy raised flags as early as Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Each year, the US Department of Energy Office of Science reviews and grades the national laboratories in its portfolio on eight performance metrics. Fermilab has received the lowest grades among the national laboratories in FY2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. A rare C grade was assigned for project management in 2021, reflective of the delays and cost overruns. In an article in the journal &quot;Science&quot;, James Decker, who was principal deputy director of DOE&#x27;s Office of Science from 1973 to 2007, stated that the performance evaluation for 2021 was &quot;one of the most scathing I have seen&quot;.

Also, in 2020, the high-energy physics community expressed concern that the cost of major projects at Fermilab have led to diversion of funds from the high-energy physics core research program, harming the health of the field. Congress increased the annual HEP budget from less than $800 million by about $250M to more than $1 billion—a 30% increase that went mainly to support large projects at Fermilab.

The Fermilab project delays led to substantial change in leadership in 2022. In September 2021, Nigel Lockyer, Director of Fermilab, resigned. Lockyer was replaced by Lia Merminga, head of the PIP II project. On March 31, 2022, James Siegrist, associate director for High Energy Physics in the Department of Energy Office of Science, who had overseen the response to the P5 report, stepped down. 
In September 2022, it was announced that deputy director for Research Joseph Lykken would step down, to be replaced by Yale Professor Bonnie Fleming, who previously served as Deputy Chief Research Officer for the neutrino program at Fermilab.
Regina (Gina) Rameika joined the DOE&#x27;s Office of Science as the associate director for the Office of High Energy Physics in his place on November 7, 2022, moving from her role as spokesperson of the DUNE Experiment. 

Although these replacements represent a substantial turn-over of the top ranks, the new management was drawn from the 2014-2022 management team and Fermilab has continued to suffer turmoil since this change-over. In particular,
new issues arose with regard to safety and access of employees, visitors and contractors.

On May 25, 2023, a contractor fell 23 ft while attempting to secure reinforcing bars on a wall for the new PIP II project site. The contractor was air-lifted to hospital in an accident considered the worst on site in decades. A DOE-appointed Accident Investigation Board concluded that the incident was preventable and &quot;recommended a long list of managerial and safety controls needed to prevent a recurrence of such an accident.&quot; As a result of the accident, the $1B PIP II project that is crucial for the success of the DUNE Experiment has been delayed. 

On September 1, 2023, Chief Research Officer Bonnie Fleming announced that the Fermilab accelerator system was temporarily shut down for safety reasons. On September 9, 2022, DOE issued order DOE O 420.2D entitled &quot;Safety of Accelerators&quot;. This document establishes the accelerator-specific safety requirements for DOE-funded accelerators and their operations. Fermilab management had one year to comply with the order, but did not meet the requirements in that timeframe. The Fermilab Main Accelerator resumed running after the DOE O 420.2D implementation was complete, in late spring, 2024.

In mid-2024, Fermilab faced a budget shortfall. This resulted in an initial furlough of employees and closure of its operations and public access for one week in August---an action that added to the considerable strife at the laboratory. The need for a furlough was surprising since the budget grew &quot;a hefty 7.6% to $739 million&quot; in fiscal year (FY) 2024. Beyond this, the six month accelerator shut down for DOE O 420.2D noncompliance should have represented substantial savings in the operations budget. According to the journal &quot;Science&quot;, the crisis stemmed from poorly managed growth: &quot;from 2022 to 2023 alone, [laboratory staff] grew by 176 members, or 9%, to 2160.&quot; The steps taken did not fully address the issue, and in November, 2.5% of the workforce was laid off. Despite this, Tracy Marc, head of Fermilab&#x27;s media services, told WTTW News that &quot;the overall financial health of the laboratory remains intact and is being managed&quot;.

===2024 Whistleblower Report===
On July 15, 2024, a report containing very serious allegations of cover-ups at the laboratory was uploaded to the arXiv physics preprint server. The allegations, which were also reported in the press, included:
* &quot;The alleged sexual assault of the NOvA and DUNE collaborator who filed and won her 2022 lawsuit in the UK [after it] was dismissed by FNAL staff.&quot;
* &quot;A cover-up of a case of guns on site in 2023, with promotion of the perpetrator and pretextuous firing of the witness.&quot;
* &quot;A cover-up of an attempt at badly hurting with an industrial vehicle a female electrician by a ... male employee.&quot;
* &quot;A cover-up of Beryllium windows blasting, with subsequent promotion of the person in charge.&quot;
* &quot;A hostile work environment, where constructive criticism is most often ignored and retaliated against.&quot;
The report also recounted a litany of complaints concerning day-to-day running of the laboratory that have been reported in this article, above, as well as a new claim of &quot;PIP-II contingency overruns within one year from CD3 approval&quot; that could potentially impact the LBNF/DUNE program.

For credibility, the report provided detailed eye-witness accounts to support the allegations. Beyond that, some information was previously publicly reported. For example, the first allegation concerning an egregious case of sexual harassment was reported in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the fact that the claimant had submitted a complaint to Fermilab which took no action appeared in court documents.
Scientists expressed fear of retribution by Fermilab leadership. In order for the whistleblowers to remain anonymous, the report was uploaded to the arXiv preprint server by Giorgio Bellettini, a respected leader in the field of particle physics who served as spokesman of the collaboration for the Collider Detector at Fermilab twice. A second signed letter of support from William Barletta of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was also included.

The report was delivered to the deputy director for Operations of the DOE Office of Science Dr. Juston Fontaine and the DOE Under Secretary for Science and Innovation Geraldine Richmond in June 2024. It was released to the public one month later, after DOE officials did not respond. On July 29, 2024, Fermilab Director Lia Merminga issued a terse response to concerned scientists, saying: &quot;The [whistleblower] document asserts various challenges at Fermilab, some of which are inaccurate, and others of which [the Fermi Research Alliance] has been working hard to address for some time.&quot; At an All Hands Meeting, Merminga also told scientific staff to &quot;stop whining.”

===New Management in 2025 by the Fermi Forward Discovery Group, LLC===
In view of the many issues facing the laboratory, in January 2023, the DOE announced a two-year process to rebid the contract for the management of the laboratory due to the performance issues. The DOE announcement of the competition explained: &quot;the purpose of this contract competition is to solicit and award a new M&amp;O contract that will result in improved contractor performance and efficiencies at FNAL. DOE expects that this competition will elicit new and innovative approaches for planning the Laboratory&#x27;s future.&quot; At an informational meeting for potential bidders on March 1, 2023, the presentation slides expanded upon issues under &quot;Major Challenges/Risks&quot; including highlighting the concern: &quot;The Laboratory continues to have challenges in Financial Management and Acquisition Management. Audits repeatedly highlight the same deficiencies and control failures year after year. Any corrective actions implemented have resulted in little to no progress. Significant procurement issues have hindered the laboratory&#x27;s ability to successfully deliver efficient and effective business systems/resources to enable the Science Mission. Substantial concerns remain regarding the ability to expend Government funds in an effective, efficient, and compliant manner.&quot;
The myriad issues facing a new contractor were listed in January 2024 in the news section of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;.

On October 1, 2024, the Department of Energy awarded the contract to operate Fermi National Accelerator to the newly-formed Fermi Forward Discovery Group, LLC (FFDG).   The FFDG represents an incremental change in management from the previous decade because the group includes the past management team for the laboratory, the FRA, that consisted of the University of Chicago and the Universities Research Association (URA). There are two additions: Amentum Environment &amp; Energy, Inc., which specializes in advanced engineering, and Longenecker &amp; Associates, which specializes in project management.    Thus, the selection left the scientific and human resources management unchanged, but did strengthen expertise to deliver large projects. 

The FFDG assumed management of Fermilab operations on January 1, 2025, with a five-year contract.
On January 13, 2025, 
Director Lia Merminga resigned. No reason was provided, however reporters from the American Institute of Physics (AIP) hypothesized the final straw was the failing 2024 &quot;report card&quot; from the Department of Energy publicly released just as the FFDG assumed management. The AIP reported: &quot;[In 2024,] the Department of Energy gave the lab its lowest marks since the current lab appraisal process began in 2006. The lab failed to meet expectations in five out of eight categories, including two C+ grades in program management and contractor leadership and a C in business systems. (The DOE Office of Science defines a B+ grade and above as meeting expectations.)&quot; 

Young-Kee Kim, Albert A. Michelson Distinguished Service Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago, is serving as Acting Director during the search for a replacement . Kim served as Deputy Director of Fermilab from 2006-2013, and so is an experienced interim replacement.

==Site==
===Access===
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (aka Fermilab) was founded in 1967 as an open science research laboratory, and, to this day, does not conduct classified research. The initial plans called for Fermilab to employ a guard force &quot;...to control movement of personnel onto the site when tests are being conducted&quot; as noted in the December 1971 Environmental Statement and &quot;..to enforce the site boundary&quot;. Early leadership moved toward greater public openness allowing for ease of scientific collaboration and public enjoyment to include the relocated bison herd.

In the late 2010s and early 2020s, the management of Fermilab began to introduce severe restrictions on access to the Fermilab site by the public and by scientists. By spring 2023, the restrictions had become so onerous that more than 2500 physicists and visitors to the laboratory signed an &quot;open petition to elected representatives to reopen Fermilab.&quot; The petition stated that: &quot;The access policy changes undermine critical aspects of the scientific process as well as the basic functioning of Fermilab. Hosting research meetings, interviewing prospective employees, collaborating with scientists outside the lab, and enacting our famously impactful education programs have all been hindered.&quot; With respect to the general public, the petition stated: &quot;Today, the general public is only permitted to access the main road, and with ID requirements that are becoming increasingly stringent, soon its doors will be closed to tourists and even to some immigrants. We can no longer drive or bike around the premises freely. The dog park, Wilson Hall with its exhibits on the top floor, and other areas are no longer generally accessible. Fishing and other activities open to the public have been canceled.&quot; The petition emphatically requested that access policies be reverted to the open laboratory model that governed the laboratory prior to 2020.

In May 2023, Director Lia Merminga posted a response to the petition on the Fermilab website, noting that
some areas on site remain open to the public during specific hours with ID access requirements. Merminga&#x27;s response justifies the new restrictions because the lab &quot;manage[s] a large amount of non-public information&quot;---reasoning that conflicts with the petition that points out that the lab is fully tax-payer funded, does no classified research, and has a government mandate to publish all of its scientific results. Further coverage of the petition and the management response appeared in the magazines &quot;Physics Today&quot; and &quot;Physics World&quot;.

In keeping with Real ID requirements for DOE facilities, all unescorted adult visitors entering the site must present a government-issued photo ID compliant with the Real ID Act. Up-to-date specifics about access can be found on the Fermilab website.

===Architecture===
Fermilab&#x27;s first director, Robert Wilson, insisted that the site&#x27;s aesthetic complexion not be marred by a collection of concrete block buildings. The design of the administrative building (Wilson Hall) was inspired by St. Pierre&#x27;s Cathedral in Beauvais, France, though it was realized in a Brutalist style. Several of the buildings and sculptures within the Fermilab reservation represent various mathematical constructs as part of their structure.

The Archimedean Spiral is the defining shape of several pumping stations as well as the building housing the MINOS experiment. The reflecting pond at Wilson Hall also showcases a hyperbolic obelisk, designed by Wilson. Some of the high-voltage transmission lines carrying power through the laboratory&#x27;s land are built to echo the Greek letter π. One can also find structural examples of the DNA double-helix spiral and a nod to the geodesic sphere.

Wilson&#x27;s sculptures on the site include &quot;Tractricious&quot;, a free-standing arrangement of steel tubes near the Industrial Complex constructed from parts and materials recycled from the Tevatron collider, and the soaring &quot;Broken Symmetry&quot;, which greets those entering the campus via the Pine Street entrance. Crowning the Ramsey Auditorium is a representation of the Möbius strip with a diameter of more than . Also scattered about the access roads and village are a massive hydraulic press and old magnetic containment channels, all painted blue.

===Wildlife===
In 1967, Wilson brought five American bison to the site, a bull and four cows, and an additional 21 were provided by the Illinois Department of Conservation. Some fearful locals believed at first that the bison were introduced in order to serve as an alarm if and when radiation at the laboratory reached dangerous levels, but they were assured by Fermilab that this claim had no merit. Today, the Fermilab bison herd is a popular attraction that draws many visitors and the grounds are also a sanctuary for other local wildlife populations. A Christmas Bird Count has occurred at the lab every year since 1976.

Working with the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, Fermilab has introduced barn owls to selected structures around the grounds.

===Tritium on site===
During running, particle beams produce tritium, an isotope of hydrogen consisting of a proton and two neutrons that is weakly radioactive with a half-life of 12.3 years. This can bind with oxygen to form tritiated water. Tritium levels measured on site are low compared to federal health and environmental standards. Fermilab monitors tritium leaving the site in surface and sewer water, and provides an FAQ sheet for those who want to learn more.

At an informational meeting for potential bidders for the management contract, held on March 1, 2023, the presentation slides indicated that although the rate of tritium leaving site is below the required standards, there is sufficient tritium contamination on site to represent a &quot;challenge&quot;. In particular, tritium produced in the NuMI beamline that sends neutrinos to experiments in Minnesota has been pumped into the industrial water cooling system that is used for equipment across the Fermilab campus. As a result, it is concluded that now &quot;tritium contamination is largely throughout the research complex.&quot;

<doc id="53303" wikidata="Q226" url="?curid=53303" title="Nuuk">
<text>Nuuk (; , formerly ) is the capital of and most populous city in Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. Nuuk is the seat of government and the territory&#x27;s largest cultural and economic center. Nuuk is also the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2025, it had a population of 20,113more than a third of the territory&#x27;s populationmaking it one of the smallest capital cities in the world by population. Nuuk is considered a modern city.

The city was founded in 1728 by the Dano-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede when he relocated from the earlier Hope Colony (), where he arrived in 1721; the governor Claus Paarss was part of the relocation. The new colony was placed at the Inuit settlement of Nûk and was named &quot;Godthaab&quot; (&quot;Good Hope&quot;). &quot;Nuuk&quot; is the Greenlandic word for &quot;cape&quot; () and is commonly found in Greenlandic place names. It is so named because of its position at the end of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord on the eastern shore of the Labrador Sea. Its latitude, at 64°11&#x27; N, makes it the world&#x27;s northernmost capital, only a few kilometres farther north than the Icelandic capital Reykjavík. When home rule was established in 1979, the authorization of place names was transferred to Greenlandic authorities, who subsequently preferred Greenlandic names over Danish ones. The name &quot;Godthåb&quot; mostly went out of use over the next two decades.

The campus of the University of Greenland, hosting Statistics Greenland and the main holdings of the Public and National Library of Greenland, is at the northern end of the district, near the road to Nuuk Airport.

Nuuk receives its electric power mainly from the renewable energy-powered Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132 kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of , the world&#x27;s longest free span.
== History ==
The site has a long history of habitation. The area around Nuuk was first occupied by the ancient, pre-Inuit, Paleo-Eskimo people of the Saqqaq culture as far back as 2200 BC when they lived in the area around the now abandoned settlement of Qoornoq. For a long time, it was occupied by the Dorset culture around the former settlement of Kangeq, but they disappeared from the Nuuk district before AD 1000. The Nuuk area was later inhabited by Norse settlers from around 1000 AD until the disappearance of the settlement for uncertain reasons during the 15th century. (Western Settlement).

The city proper was founded as the fort of Godt-Haab in 1728 by the royal governor Claus Paarss, when he relocated the missionary and merchant Hans Egede&#x27;s earlier Hope Colony () from Kangeq Island to the mainland. At that time, Greenland was formally still a Norwegian colony (until 1814) under the united Dano-Norwegian Crown, but the colony had not had any contact for over three centuries. Paarss&#x27;s colonists consisted of mutinous soldiers, convicts, and prostitutes and most died within the first year of scurvy and other ailments. In 1733 and 1734, a smallpox epidemic killed most of the native population as well as Egede&#x27;s wife. Hans Egede went back to Denmark in 1736 after 15 years in Greenland, leaving his son Poul to continue his work. Godthaab became the seat of government for the Danish colony of South Greenland, while Godhavn (modern Qeqertarsuaq) was the capital of North Greenland until 1940, when the administration was unified in Godthaab.

In 1733, Moravian missionaries received permission to begin a mission on the island; in 1747, there were enough converts to prompt the construction of the Moravian Brethren Mission House and the formal establishment of the mission as New Herrnhut (). This became the nucleus for present-day Nuuk as many Greenlanders from the southeastern coast left their territory to live at the mission station. From this base, further missions were established at Lichtenfels (1748), Lichtenau (1774), Friedrichsthal (1824), Umanak (1861), and Idlorpait (1864), before they were discontinued in 1900 and folded into the Lutheran Church of Denmark.

Around 1850, Greenland, and especially the area around Nuuk, were in crisis. The Europeans had brought diseases and a culture that conflicted with the ways of the native Greenlanders. Many Greenlanders were living in poverty. In 1853, Hinrich Johannes Rink came to Greenland and was surprised at how local Greenlandic culture and identity had been suppressed under Danish influence. In response, in 1861, he started the &quot;Atuagagdliutit&quot;, Greenland&#x27;s first newspaper, with a native Greenlander as editor. This newspaper based in Nuuk later became an important token of Greenlandic identity.

During World War II, there was a reawakening of Greenlandic national identity. The use of written Greenlandic grew, a council was assembled under Eske Brun&#x27;s leadership in Nuuk. In 1940, an American and a Canadian Consulate were established in Nuuk.

Under new regulations in 1950, two councils amalgamated into one. This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the city of Godthåb was renamed Nuuk by the Greenland Home Rule government. The city boomed during the 1950s when Denmark began to modernize Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and Danes. Over a third of Greenland&#x27;s total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.

A 2016 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide suggested that
== Geography ==

Nuuk is located at approximately at the mouth of Nuup Kangerlua (formerly Baal&#x27;s River), some from the shores of the Labrador Sea on the southwestern coast of Greenland, and about south of the Arctic Circle. Initially, the fjord flows to the northwest, to then turn southwest at , splitting into three arms in its lower run, with three big islands in between the arms: Sermitsiaq Island, Qeqertarsuaq Island, and Qoornuup Qeqertarsua. The fjord widens into a bay dotted with skerries near its mouth, opening into Labrador Sea at approximately . Some to the northeast, reaching a height of , Sermitsiaq can be seen from almost everywhere in Nuuk. The mountain has given its name to the nationwide newspaper &quot;Sermitsiaq&quot;. Closer to the town are the peaks of Store Malene, , and Lille Malene, . The magnetic declination at Nuuk is extreme.


===Climate===

Nuuk has a maritime-influenced tundra climate (Köppen ET) with long, cold, snowy winters and short, cool summers. Although the winters in Nuuk are relatively cold, they are milder compared to other tundra climates, such as in Alaska in the United States or parts of Eastern Siberia. Instead, peak winter is similar to identical latitudes in the Nordic countries. On 21 December, the shortest day and longest night of the year, the sun rises at 11:22 am and sets at 3:28 pm. By contrast, on the longest day and shortest night of the year, 21 June, the sun rises at 3:53 am and does not set until 1:03 am, producing constant civil twilight. Nuuk can have mild temperatures on brief occasions year-round, with each month having recorded or warmer, although only June, July, August, and September have recorded what could be considered hot weather (defined as or higher). The monthly averages range from to , whereas all-time extremes range from on 14 January 1984 to on 6 July 2008. The record wind in Nuuk is 68 km/h.

The average monthly temperature ( in July) is colder than what is considered the limit for trees ( during the warmest month). There are a few planted trees which do not sustain well.

== Demographics ==
With 19,872 inhabitants as of January 2024, Nuuk is by far the largest town in Greenland. The population of Nuuk has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, data from 2015 showed 3,826 were born outside the country. Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland. Half of Greenland&#x27;s immigrants live in Nuuk, which also accounts for a quarter of the country&#x27;s native population.
== Government ==
As the capital of Greenland, Nuuk is the administrative center of the country, containing all of the important government buildings and institutions. The public sector bodies are also the town&#x27;s largest employer.

As of January 2021, the mayor of Nuuk is Charlotte Ludvigsen. She replaced former mayor Asii Chemnitz Narup in 2019 following a social media scandal involving posts criticizing her party. Like Narup, Ludvigsen is a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.

Greenland&#x27;s self-government parliament, the Inatsisartut, is in Nuuk. It has 31 seats and its members are elected by popular vote on the basis of proportional representation to serve four-year terms. All of Greenland&#x27;s major political parties have their headquarters in Nuuk, including the Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut, Democrats, Atassut, Association of Candidates and the Women&#x27;s Party.

=== KANUKOKA ===

KANUKOKA () was based in Nuuk. It was an association of Greenland&#x27;s municipalities, led by Enok Sandgreen. The aim of the organisation was to facilitate cooperation among all five municipalities of Greenland: Avannaata, Kujalleq, Qeqertalik, Qeqqata, and Sermersooq. However, Sermersooq and Qeqertalik both withdrew and KANUKOKA was dissolved as of Tuesday, 31 July 2018. The organisation ran the municipal elections every four years, with the last election taking place in 2016. All municipal authorities in Greenland were members of the organisation until its 2018 dissolution. The association was overseen by Maliina Abelsen, the Minister for Social Affairs in the Government of Greenland.

== Economy ==
Although only a small town, Nuuk has developed trade, business, shipping and other industries. It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbor, but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, the fishing industry in the capital declined. The port is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland&#x27;s fishing fleet. The local Royal Greenland processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US$7 million) per annum, mainly (80%) shrimp, but also cod, lumpfish and halibut. Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk&#x27;s fish markets, the largest being Kalaaliaraq Market. Minerals including zinc and gold have contributed to the development of Nuuk&#x27;s economy.

The city, like much of Greenland, is heavily dependent upon Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.

=== Energy ===
All of Greenland&#x27;s electricity is supplied by the government-owned company Nukissiorfiit, which has a monopoly on the electricity in Greenland. Since 1993, Nuuk has received its electric power mainly from Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132 kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of , the world&#x27;s longest free span.

=== Education ===

Nuuk has several educational institutions of higher learning. The University of Greenland (Ilisimatusarfik), the only university in Greenland, is in Nuuk. The university was founded in 1987 and expanded in 2007 with the new building, &quot;Ilimmarfik&quot;, housing departments of journalism, management and economics, language, literature and media, cultural and social history, theology and religion and social work. Nuuk is also home to the Department of Learning (Ilinniarfissuaq), the oldest educational facility in Greenland, in the old colonial part of Nuuk (&quot;Nuutoqaq&quot;: Old Nuuk). Other notable educational institutions include the Department of Nursing and Health Science, Nuuk Technical College and the Iron &amp; Metal School.

== Transportation ==

=== Airport ===

Nuuk has an international airport to the northeast of the town center. Built in 1979, it is a hub for Air Greenland, which is also headquartered in Nuuk and operates its technical base at the airport. There are flights inside Greenland and to Iceland. A decision has been made to extend the runway to allow for flights to European destinations, such as Denmark.

Starting in mid 2024, Air Greenland and Canadian North airlines have an agreement with weekly flights between Nuuk and Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada.

=== Sea ===
As a result of the high cost of flying goods to Greenland, Nuuk and other towns in Greenland are connected to Denmark by cargo vessels which sail mainly from Aalborg during the warmer months after the winter ice has melted. They bring clothing, flour, medicine, timber and machinery and return with deep-frozen shrimp and fish. For most of the year, Nuuk is served twice-weekly by the coastal ferry of the Arctic Umiaq Line, which links the communities of the western coast.

=== Roadways ===

The majority of buses and cars owned in Greenland operate in Nuuk. There are no roads connecting Nuuk with other areas of Greenland. The main street in Nuuk is Aqqusinersuaq, with a number of shops and the 140-room Hotel Hans Egede.

Since 2009, the city bus service Nuup Bussii provides city transport services in Nuuk for the Sermersooq municipality, linking the town center with the airport, the outlying districts and neighborhoods of Nuussuaq, Qinngorput, as well as Qernertunnguit in Quassussuup Tungaa. In 2012, the buses transported more than 2 million passengers around the city of Nuuk.

<text>A natural satellite is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet, dwarf planet, or small Solar System body (or sometimes another natural satellite). Natural satellites are colloquially referred to as moons, a derivation from the Moon of Earth.

In the Solar System, there are six planetary satellite systems containing 288 known natural satellites altogether. Seven objects commonly considered dwarf planets by astronomers are also known to have natural satellites: , Pluto, Haumea, , Makemake, , and Eris. As of January 2022, there are 447 other minor planets known to have natural satellites.

A planet usually has at least around 10,000 times the mass of any natural satellites that orbit it, with a correspondingly much larger diameter. The Earth–Moon system is a unique exception in the Solar System; at 3,474 kilometres (2,158 miles) across, the Moon is 0.273 times the diameter of Earth and about of its mass. The next largest ratios are the Neptune–Triton system at 0.055 (with a mass ratio of about 1 to 4790), the Saturn–Titan system at 0.044 (with the second mass ratio next to the Earth–Moon system, 1 to 4220), the Jupiter–Ganymede system at 0.038, and the Uranus–Titania system at 0.031. For the category of dwarf planets, Charon has the largest ratio, being 0.52 the diameter and 12.2% the mass of Pluto.

==Terminology==
The first known natural satellite was the Moon, but it was considered a &quot;planet&quot; until Copernicus&#x27; introduction of &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; in 1543. Until the discovery of the Galilean satellites in 1610 there was no opportunity for referring to such objects as a class. Galileo chose to refer to his discoveries as &quot;Planetæ&quot; (&quot;planets&quot;), but later discoverers chose other terms to distinguish them from the objects they orbited.

The first to use the term &quot;satellite&quot; to describe orbiting bodies was the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in his pamphlet &quot;Narratio de Observatis a se quatuor Iouis satellitibus erronibus&quot; (&quot;Narration About Four Satellites of Jupiter Observed&quot;) in 1610. He derived the term from the Latin word &quot;satelles&quot;, meaning &quot;guard&quot;, &quot;attendant&quot;, or &quot;companion&quot;, because the &quot;satellites&quot; accompanied their primary planet in their journey through the heavens.

The term &quot;satellite&quot; thus became the normal one for referring to an object orbiting a planet, as it avoided the ambiguity of &quot;moon&quot;. In 1957, however, the launching of the artificial object Sputnik created a need for new terminology. The terms &quot;man-made satellite&quot; and &quot;artificial moon&quot; were very quickly abandoned in favor of the simpler &quot;satellite&quot;. As a consequence, the term has become linked with artificial objects flown in space.

Because of this shift in meaning, the term &quot;moon&quot;, which had continued to be used in a generic sense in works of popular science and fiction, has regained respectability and is now used interchangeably with &quot;natural satellite&quot;, even in scientific articles. When it is necessary to avoid both the ambiguity of confusion with Earth&#x27;s natural satellite the Moon and the natural satellites of the other planets on the one hand, and artificial satellites on the other, the term &quot;natural satellite&quot; (using &quot;natural&quot; in a sense opposed to &quot;artificial&quot;) is used. To further avoid ambiguity, the convention is to capitalize the word Moon when referring to Earth&#x27;s natural satellite (a proper noun), but not when referring to other natural satellites (common nouns).

Many authors define &quot;satellite&quot; or &quot;natural satellite&quot; as orbiting some planet or minor planet, synonymous with &quot;moon&quot; – by such a definition all natural satellites are moons, but Earth and other planets are not satellites.
A few recent authors define &quot;moon&quot; as &quot;a satellite of a planet or minor planet&quot;, and &quot;planet&quot; as &quot;a satellite of a star&quot; – such authors consider Earth as a &quot;natural satellite of the Sun&quot;.

=== Definition of a moon ===
There is no established lower limit on what is considered a &quot;moon&quot;. Every natural celestial body with an identified orbit around a planet of the Solar System, some as small as a kilometer across, has been considered a moon, though objects a tenth that size within Saturn&#x27;s rings, which have not been directly observed, have been called &quot;moonlets&quot;. Small asteroid moons (natural satellites of asteroids), such as Dactyl, have also been called moonlets.

The upper limit is also vague. Two orbiting bodies are sometimes described as a double planet rather than a primary and satellite. Asteroids such as 90 Antiope are considered double asteroids, but they have not forced a clear definition of what constitutes a moon. Some authors consider the Pluto–Charon system to be a double (dwarf) planet. The most common dividing line on what is considered a moon rests upon whether the barycentre is below the surface of the larger body, though this is somewhat arbitrary because it depends on distance as well as relative mass.

== Origin and orbital characteristics ==

The natural satellites orbiting relatively close to the planet on prograde, uninclined circular orbits (&quot;regular&quot; satellites) are generally thought to have been formed out of the same collapsing region of the protoplanetary disk that created its primary. In contrast, irregular satellites (generally orbiting on distant, inclined, eccentric and/or retrograde orbits) are thought to be captured asteroids possibly further fragmented by collisions. Most of the major natural satellites of the Solar System have regular orbits, while most of the small natural satellites have irregular orbits. The Moon and the Moons of Pluto are exceptions among large bodies in that they are thought to have originated from the collision of two large protoplanetary objects early in the Solar System&#x27;s history (see the giant impact hypothesis). The material that would have been placed in orbit around the central body is predicted to have reaccreted to form one or more orbiting natural satellites. As opposed to planetary-sized bodies, asteroid moons are thought to commonly form by this process. Triton is another exception; although large and in a close, circular orbit, its motion is retrograde and it is thought to be a captured dwarf planet.

=== Temporary satellites ===

The capture of an asteroid from a heliocentric orbit is not always permanent. According to simulations, temporary satellites should be a common phenomenon. The only observed examples are , , .

 was a temporary satellite of Earth for nine months in 2006 and 2007.

== Tidal locking ==
Most regular moons (natural satellites following relatively close and prograde orbits with small orbital inclination and eccentricity) in the Solar System are tidally locked to their respective primaries, meaning that the same side of the natural satellite always faces its planet. This phenomenon comes about through a loss of energy due to tidal forces raised by the planet, slowing the rotation of the satellite until it is negligible. Exceptions are known; one such exception is Saturn&#x27;s natural satellite Hyperion, which rotates chaotically because of the gravitational influence of Titan. Pluto&#x27;s four, circumbinary small moons also rotate chaotically due to Charon&#x27;s influence.

In contrast, the outer natural satellites of the giant planets (irregular satellites) are too far away to have become locked. For example, Jupiter&#x27;s Himalia, Saturn&#x27;s Phoebe, and Neptune&#x27;s Nereid have rotation periods in the range of ten hours, whereas their orbital periods are hundreds of days.

== Satellites of satellites ==

No &quot;moons of moons&quot; or subsatellites (natural satellites that orbit a natural satellite of a planet) are currently known. In most cases, the tidal effects of the planet would make such a system unstable.

However, calculations performed after the 2008 detection of a possible ring system around Saturn&#x27;s moon Rhea indicate that satellites orbiting Rhea could have stable orbits. Furthermore, the suspected rings are thought to be narrow, a phenomenon normally associated with shepherd moons. However, targeted images taken by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft failed to detect rings around Rhea.

It has also been proposed that Saturn&#x27;s moon Iapetus had a satellite in the past; this is one of several hypotheses that have been put forward to account for its equatorial ridge.

Light-curve analysis suggests that Saturn&#x27;s irregular satellite Kiviuq is extremely prolate, and is likely a contact binary or even a binary moon.

== Trojan satellites ==

Two natural satellites are known to have small companions at both their and Lagrangian points, sixty degrees ahead and behind the body in its orbit. These companions are called trojan moons, as their orbits are analogous to the trojan asteroids of Jupiter. The trojan moons are Telesto and Calypso, which are the leading and following companions, respectively, of the Saturnian moon Tethys; and Helene and Polydeuces, the leading and following companions of the Saturnian moon Dione.

== Asteroid satellites ==
The discovery of 243 Ida&#x27;s natural satellite Dactyl in the early 1990s confirmed that some asteroids have natural satellites; indeed, 87 Sylvia has two. Some, such as 90 Antiope, are double asteroids with two comparably sized components.

== Shape ==


Neptune&#x27;s moon Proteus is the largest irregularly shaped natural satellite; the shapes of Eris&#x27; moon Dysnomia and &#x27; moon Vanth are unknown. All other known natural satellites that are at least the size of Uranus&#x27;s Miranda have lapsed into rounded ellipsoids under hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e. are &quot;round/rounded satellites&quot; and are sometimes categorized as planetary-mass moons. (Dysnomia&#x27;s density is known to be high enough that it is probably a solid ellipsoid as well.) The larger natural satellites, being tidally locked, tend toward ovoid (egg-like) shapes: squat at their poles and with longer equatorial axes in the direction of their primaries (their planets) than in the direction of their motion. Saturn&#x27;s moon Mimas, for example, has a major axis 9% greater than its polar axis and 5% greater than its other equatorial axis. Methone, another of Saturn&#x27;s moons, is only around 3 km in diameter and visibly egg-shaped. The effect is smaller on the largest natural satellites, where their gravity is greater relative to the effects of tidal distortion, especially those that orbit less massive planets or, as in the case of the Moon, at greater distances.
==Geological activity==
Of the nineteen known natural satellites in the Solar System that are large enough to be gravitationally rounded, several remain geologically active today. Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, while Europa, Enceladus, Titan and Triton display evidence of ongoing tectonic activity and cryovolcanism. In the first three cases, the geological activity is powered by the tidal heating resulting from having eccentric orbits close to their giant-planet primaries. (This mechanism would have also operated on Triton in the past before its orbit was circularized.) Many other natural satellites, such as Earth&#x27;s Moon, Ganymede, Tethys, and Miranda, show evidence of past geological activity, resulting from energy sources such as the decay of their primordial radioisotopes, greater past orbital eccentricities (due in some cases to past orbital resonances), or the differentiation or freezing of their interiors. Enceladus and Triton both have active features resembling geysers, although in the case of Triton solar heating appears to provide the energy. Titan and Triton have significant atmospheres; Titan also has hydrocarbon lakes. All four of the Galilean moons have atmospheres, though they are extremely thin. Four of the largest natural satellites, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan, are thought to have subsurface oceans of liquid water, while smaller Enceladus also supports a global subsurface ocean of liquid water.

== Occurrence in the Solar System ==
Besides planets and dwarf planets objects within our Solar System known to have natural satellites are 76 in the asteroid belt (five with two each), four Jupiter trojans, 39 near-Earth objects (two with two satellites each), and 14 Mars-crossers. There are also 84 known natural satellites of trans-Neptunian objects. Some 150 additional small bodies have been observed within the rings of Saturn, but only a few were tracked long enough to establish orbits. Planets around other stars are likely to have satellites as well, and although numerous candidates have been detected to date, none have yet been confirmed.

Of the inner planets, Mercury and Venus have no natural satellites; Earth has one large natural satellite, known as the Moon; and Mars has two tiny natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos.
The giant planets have extensive systems of natural satellites, including half a dozen comparable in size to Earth&#x27;s Moon: the four Galilean moons, Saturn&#x27;s Titan, and Neptune&#x27;s Triton. Saturn has an additional six mid-sized natural satellites massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, and Uranus has five. It has been suggested that some satellites may potentially harbour life.

Among the objects generally agreed by astronomers to be dwarf planets, Ceres and have no known natural satellites. Pluto has the relatively large natural satellite Charon and four smaller natural satellites; Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Haumea has two natural satellites; , , Makemake, , and have one each. The Pluto–Charon system is unusual in that the center of mass lies in open space between the two, a characteristic sometimes associated with a double-planet system.

The seven largest natural satellites in the Solar System (those bigger than 2,500 km across) are Jupiter&#x27;s Galilean moons (Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa), Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, Earth&#x27;s moon, and Neptune&#x27;s captured natural satellite Triton. Triton, the smallest of these, has more mass than all smaller natural satellites together. Similarly in the next size group of nine mid-sized natural satellites, between 1,000 km and 1,600 km across, Titania, Oberon, Rhea, Iapetus, Charon, Ariel, Umbriel, Dione, and Tethys, the smallest, Tethys, has more mass than all smaller natural satellites together. As well as the natural satellites of the various planets, there are also over 80 known natural satellites of the dwarf planets, minor planets and other small Solar System bodies. Some studies estimate that up to 15% of all trans-Neptunian objects could have satellites.

The following is a comparative table classifying the natural satellites in the Solar System by diameter. The column on the right includes some notable planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and trans-Neptunian objects for comparison. The natural satellites of the planets are named after mythological figures. These are predominantly Greek, except for the Uranian natural satellites, which are named after Shakespearean characters. The twenty satellites massive enough to be round are in bold in the table below. Minor planets and satellites where there is disagreement in the literature on roundness are italicized in the table below.
