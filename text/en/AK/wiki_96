<text>The Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) is a women&#x27;s professional basketball league in the United States. The league comprises 13 teams (15 in 2026). It is considered the premier professional women&#x27;s basketball league in the world. The WNBA is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.

The WNBA was founded on April 24, 1996, as the women&#x27;s counterpart to the National Basketball Association (NBA); league play began in 1997. The regular season runs from May to September, with each team playing 44 games. The top eight teams (regardless of conference) qualify for the playoffs, culminating in the WNBA Finals, which is played in October.

The All-Star Game occurs midway through the season in July. The league hosts an annual mid-season competition, the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup. The WNBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB), which is recognized by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) as the governing body for basketball in the United States.

==History==
===League founded and play begins (1996–1997)===
The creation of the WNBA was officially approved by the NBA Board of Governors on April 24, 1996, and announced at a press conference with Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie, and Sheryl Swoopes in attendance. The new WNBA had to compete with the recently formed American Basketball League, another professional women&#x27;s basketball league that began play in the fall of 1996, but would cease operation during its 1998–99 season.

The WNBA began with eight teams: the Charlotte Sting, Cleveland Rockers, Houston Comets, and New York Liberty in the Eastern Conference; and the Los Angeles Sparks, Phoenix Mercury, Sacramento Monarchs, and Utah Starzz in the Western Conference.

While not the first major women&#x27;s professional basketball league in the United States (a distinction held by the defunct WBL), the WNBA is the only league to receive full backing of the NBA. The WNBA logo, &quot;Logo Woman&quot;, paralleled the NBA logo and was selected out of 50 different designs.

On the heels of a much-publicized gold medal run by the 1996 USA Basketball Women&#x27;s National Team at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, the WNBA then began its first season on June 21, 1997. The first WNBA game featured the New York Liberty facing the Los Angeles Sparks in Los Angeles. The Liberty defeated the Sparks 67-57. A crowd of 14,284 attended the game at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, California. The game was televised nationally in the United States on the NBC television network. At the start of the 1997 season, the WNBA had television deals in with NBC (NBA rights holder), ESPN, and Lifetime. Penny Toler scored the league&#x27;s first point.

===Houston domination and league expansion (1997–2000)===
The WNBA centered its marketing campaign, dubbed &quot;We Got Next&quot;, around stars Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie, and Sheryl Swoopes. In the league&#x27;s first season, Leslie&#x27;s Los Angeles Sparks underperformed and Swoopes sat out much of the season due to her pregnancy. Perhaps the WNBA&#x27;s first star was MVP Cynthia Cooper, Swoopes&#x27; teammate on the Houston Comets. The Comets defeated Lobo&#x27;s New York Liberty in the first WNBA championship game. The initial &quot;We Got Next&quot; advertisement ran before each season until it was replaced with a &quot;We Got Game&quot; campaign.

Two teams were added in 1998 (Detroit and Washington), and two more in 1999 (Orlando and Minnesota), bringing the total number of teams in the league up to 12. The 1999 season began with a collective bargaining agreement between players and the league, marking the first collective bargaining agreement to be signed in the history of women&#x27;s professional sports.
That year, the WNBA also announced that it would add four more teams for the 2000 season (the Indiana Fever, the Seattle Storm, the Miami Sol, and the Portland Fire), bringing the league up to 16 teams. WNBA president Val Ackerman discussed expansion by saying, &quot;This won&#x27;t be the end of it. We expect to keep growing the league.&quot;

In 1999, the league&#x27;s chief competition, the American Basketball League (ABL), declared bankruptcy. Many of the ABL&#x27;s star players, including several Olympic gold medalists (such as Nikki McCray and Dawn Staley) and a number of standout college performers (including Kate Starbird and Jennifer Rizzotti), joined the rosters of WNBA teams, enhancing the overall quality of play in the league. When a lockout resulted in an abbreviated NBA season, the WNBA saw faltering TV viewership.

On May 23, 2000, the Houston Comets became the first WNBA team to be invited to the White House Rose Garden. Before this invitation, only men&#x27;s sports teams had traveled to the White House. At the end of the 2000 season, the Houston Comets won their fourth championship, capturing every title since the league&#x27;s inception. Led by the &quot;Big Three&quot; of Sheryl Swoopes, Tina Thompson, and Cynthia Cooper (who won the Finals MVP for all four championships), the Comets dominated every team in the league. Under head coach Van Chancellor, the team posted a 98–24 record their first four seasons (16–3 in the playoffs). After 2000, Cooper retired from the league, and the Comets&#x27; dynasty came to an end.

===L.A. Sparks success; new league ownership and contraction (2001–2002)===

The Los Angeles Sparks had the best record during the 2001 WNBA season. Led by Lisa Leslie, the Sparks posted a regular-season record of 28–4 and advanced to their first WNBA Finals, sweeping the Charlotte Sting.

Looking to repeat in 2002, the Sparks again made a strong run toward the postseason, going 25–7 in the regular season under head coach Michael Cooper, who formerly played for the Los Angeles Lakers. Again, Leslie dominated her opponents throughout the Playoffs, leading the Sparks to a perfect 6–0 record, beating the New York Liberty in the 2002 Finals.

Teams and the league were collectively owned by the NBA until the end of 2002, when the NBA sold WNBA teams either to their NBA counterparts in the same city or to a third party as a result of the dot-com bubble. This led to two teams moving: Utah moved to San Antonio, and Orlando moved to Connecticut and became the first WNBA team to be owned by a third party instead of an NBA franchise. This sale of teams also led to two teams folding, the Miami Sol and Portland Fire, because new owners could not be found.

===Bill Laimbeer leaves his mark (2003–2006)===

The Women&#x27;s National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) threatened to strike in 2003 if a new deal was not worked out between players and the league. The result was a delay in the start of the 2003 preseason and the 2003 WNBA draft. As a result of the strike, the league received negative publicity.

Former Detroit Pistons forward, Bill Laimbeer, took over the Detroit Shock in 2002 as head coach and general manager. He had high hopes for the Detroit Shock, despite the team having gone just 9–23 its previous season. Three Shock members made it the 2003 All-Star Game (Swin Cash, Cheryl Ford, and Deanna Nolan) and Laimbeer orchestrated a worst-to-first turnaround with the Shock finishing the season 25–9 and in first place in the Eastern Conference. After winning the first two rounds of the Playoffs, the Shock faced two-time champion, Los Angeles Sparks, and Lisa Leslie in the 2003 Finals. The Shock defeated the Los Angeles Sparks, winning Game Three on a three-pointer by Deanna Nolan.

After the 2003 season, the Cleveland Rockers, one of the league&#x27;s original eight teams, folded because its owners were unwilling to continue operating the franchise.

Val Ackerman, the first WNBA president, resigned effective February 1, 2005, citing the desire to spend more time with her family. Ackerman later became president of USA Basketball. On February 15, 2005, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that Donna Orender, who had been serving as the senior vice president of the PGA Tour and who had played for several teams in the now-defunct Women&#x27;s Pro Basketball League, would be Ackerman&#x27;s successor as of April 2005.

The WNBA awarded an expansion team to Chicago (later named the Chicago Sky) in February 2006. In the off-season, a set of rule changes was approved that made the WNBA more like the NBA.

In 2006, the league reached a milestone as the first team-oriented women&#x27;s professional sports league to exist for ten consecutive seasons. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary, the WNBA released its All-Decade Team, comprising the ten WNBA players who had contributed, through on-court play and off-court activities, the most to women&#x27;s basketball during the league&#x27;s existence.

After not making it to the Finals in 2004 and 2005, the Shock bounced back in 2006 behind newly acquired Katie Smith, along with six remaining members from their 2003 Finals run (Cash, Ford, Holland-Corn, Nolan, Powell, and Riley). The Shock finished second in the Eastern Conference and knocked out first-seeded Connecticut in the second round of the Playoffs. The Shock faced reigning champion Sacramento Monarchs in a five-game series, winning in Game Five on their home floor.

===Bringing &quot;Paul Ball&quot; to the WNBA (2007–2009)===

In December 2006, the Charlotte Bobcats organization announced it would no longer operate the Charlotte Sting. Soon after, the WNBA announced that the Sting would not operate for 2007. A dispersal draft was held on January 8, 2007. Teams selected in inverse order of their 2006 records with the Chicago Sky receiving the first pick.

Former Los Angeles Lakers championship coach, Paul Westhead, was named head coach of the Phoenix Mercury on October 11, 2005, bringing his up-tempo style of play to the WNBA. This fast-paced offense was perfect for his team, especially after the league shortened the shot clock from 30 seconds to 24 seconds in 2006. Much like the early Houston Comets championship teams, the Phoenix Mercury had risen to prominence led by their own &quot;Big Three&quot; of Cappie Pondexter, Diana Taurasi, and Penny Taylor.

The Mercury were well-suited for the fast offense driven by their three stars. Phoenix averaged a league-record 88.97 points per game in 2007. Other teams could not keep up with their new style of play, and the Mercury were propelled into first place in the Western Conference. Facing the reigning champions, the Detroit Shock, the Mercury imposed their high-scoring offense with hopes of capturing their first title in franchise history. Averaging 93.2 points per game in the 2007 Finals, the Mercury beat Detroit on their home floor in front of 22,076 fans in game five to claim their first-ever WNBA title.

In October 2007, the WNBA awarded another expansion franchise to Atlanta. Atlanta businessman Ron Terwilliger was the original owner of the new team. Citizens of Atlanta were voted for their choice of the new team&#x27;s nickname and colors. The Atlanta Dream, as they were named, played their first regular-season game on May 17, losing to the Connecticut Sun 67–100.

Paul Westhead resigned from the Mercury after capturing the 2007 title and Penny Taylor opted to stay home to prepare for the 2008 Summer Olympics, causing the Mercury to falter in 2008. The team posted a 16–18 record and became the first team in WNBA history to miss the Playoffs after winning the championship in the previous season. In their place, the Detroit Shock won their third championship under coach Bill Laimbeer, solidifying their place in WNBA history before Laimbeer resigned early in 2009, effectively ending the Shock dynasty.

During the 2008 regular season, the first-ever outdoor professional basketball game in North America was played at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City. The Indiana Fever defeated the New York Liberty 71–55 in front of over 19,000 fans.

Late in 2008, the WNBA took over ownership of one of the league&#x27;s original franchises, the Houston Comets. The Comets ceased operations on December 1, 2008, after no owners for the franchise could be found. A dispersal draft took place on December 8, 2008, with the first pick, Sancho Lyttle, taken by the Atlanta Dream.

After an unsatisfying conclusion in 2008, the Mercury looked to bounce back to championship caliber. New head coach Corey Gaines implemented Paul Westhead&#x27;s style of play, and the Mercury averaged 92.82 points per game throughout the 2009 season. Helped by the return of Penny Taylor, the Mercury once again locked up first place in the Western Conference and advanced to the 2009 Finals. The championship series was a battle of contrasting styles as the Mercury (number one league offense, 92.82 points per game) had to face the Indiana Fever (number three league defense, 73.55 points per game). The series went five games, including arguably one of the most thrilling games in WNBA history in game one of the series (Phoenix winning in overtime, 120–116). The Mercury beat the Fever in game five, this time on their home court, capturing their second WNBA championship.

Not only did Paul Westhead&#x27;s system influence his Mercury team, but it created a domino effect throughout the league. Young athletic players were capable of scoring more and playing at a faster pace. As a league, the 2010 average of 80.35 points per game was the best, far surpassing the 69.2 average in the league&#x27;s inaugural season.

===Changing of the guard (2010–2012)===
On October 20, 2009, the WNBA announced that the Detroit Shock would relocate to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to become the Tulsa Shock. On November 20, 2009, the WNBA announced that the Sacramento Monarchs had folded due to lack of support from its current owners, the Maloof family, who were also the owners of the Sacramento Kings at the time. The league announced it would seek new owners to relocate the team to the San Francisco Bay Area; however, no ownership was found and a dispersal draft was held on December 14, 2009.

The 2010 season saw a tight race in the East, with three teams being tied for first place on the final day of the regular season. Five of the six teams in the East were in first place at some point during the season. The East held a .681 winning percentage over the West, its highest ever. In the 2010 Finals, two new teams represented each conference: the Seattle Storm and the Atlanta Dream. Seattle made their first finals appearance since winning it all in 2004, and Atlanta, coming into the playoffs as a four seed, impressively swept its opponents in the first two rounds to advance to the Finals in only the third year of the team&#x27;s existence.

After the 2010 season, President Orender announced she would be resigning from her position as of December 31. On April 21, 2011, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that former Girl Scouts of the USA Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Laurel J. Richie, would assume duties as president on May 16, 2011.
The 2011 season began with strong publicity brought on by the rising young stars of the league and the NBA lockout.
The 2011 NBA lockout began on July 1, 2011. Unlike the previous lockout, which affected the WNBA, president Laurel J. Richie confirmed that this lockout would not affect the WNBA. If the NBA season was shortened or canceled, the 2012 WNBA season (including the WNBA teams still owned by NBA owners) would run as planned. The lockout ended on November 26, and NBA teams would play a 66-game regular season following the lockout.

Many news outlets began covering the league more frequently. NBA TV, the television home of the NBA scheduled over 70 regular-season games to be televised (along with a dozen more on ESPN2 and ABC). The new influx of young talent into the league gave many teams something to be excited about. Players like Candace Parker of the Sparks, Maya Moore of the Lynx, DeWanna Bonner of the Mercury, Angel McCoughtry of the Dream, Sylvia Fowles of the Sky, Tina Charles of the Sun, and Liz Cambage of the Shock brought a new level of excitement to the game, adding talent to the teams of young veterans such as Diana Taurasi, Seimone Augustus and Cappie Pondexter. The level of play seemed to be evidenced by higher scoring, better defense, and higher shooting percentages. By the end of the 2011 regular season, nine of the twelve teams in the league had increased attendance over their 2010 averages.

Connecticut Sun center, Tina Charles, set a league record for double-doubles in a season with 23. Also, Sylvia Fowles of the Chicago Sky became only the second player in WNBA history to finish a season averaging at least 20 points (20.0ppg) and 10 rebounds (10.2rpg) per game. The San Antonio Silver Stars experienced boosts from their young players as well; rookie Danielle Adams scored 32 points off the bench in June and fellow rookie Danielle Robinson had a 36-point game in September. Atlanta Dream forward, Angel McCoughtry, was the first player in league history to average over 20 points per game (21.6ppg) while playing under 30 minutes per game (27.9mpg).

McCoughtry led her team to the 2011 Finals, appearing for the second straight year, but despite breaking her own Finals scoring record, the Dream were swept for the second straight year, this time by the Minnesota Lynx, which won its first title behind a fully healthy Seimone Augustus.

2012 featured a long Olympic break. The Indiana Fever won that year&#x27;s WNBA championship.

===The Three to See (2013–2019)===
The much-publicized 2013 WNBA draft produced Baylor University star Brittney Griner, Delaware&#x27;s Elena Delle Donne, and Notre Dame All American Skylar Diggins (now Diggins-Smith) as the top three picks. The draft was the first to be televised in primetime on ESPN. Griner, Delle Donne, and Diggins were thus labeled &quot;The Three To See.&quot; With the draft came other standouts such as Tayler Hill, Layshia Clarendon and Alex Bentley. The retirement of legends Katie Smith, Tina Thompson, Ticha Penicheiro, and Sheryl Swoopes coupled with the arrival of highly touted rookies and new rule changes effectively marked the end of an era for the WNBA and the ushering of another. 

On the court, the Minnesota Lynx won their second title in three years, defeating the Atlanta Dream in the 2013 Finals and becoming the first team to sweep the playoff series since the Seattle Storm.

The promotion of Griner, Delle Donne, and Diggins helped boost television ratings for the league by 28 percent, and half of the teams ended the season profitable. The improved health of the league was on display after the season, when the Los Angeles Sparks&#x27; ownership group folded; it took the league only a few weeks to line up Guggenheim Partners to purchase the team, and the franchise also garnered interest from the ownership of the Golden State Warriors.

Two more franchise relocations happened in the following years, as the Tulsa Shock moved in 2016 to the Dallas–Fort Worth region in Texas and were renamed the Dallas Wings, and in 2018 the San Antonio Stars went to Nevada, becoming the Las Vegas Aces.

=== New CBA and Commissioner&#x27;s Cup plans (2020) ===
During the 2018 season, the WNBA players&#x27; union opted out of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the league, which ended after the 2019 season. In January 2020, the league and union announced that they had reached an agreement on a new CBA to take effect with the 2020 season and running through 2027. Among the features of the new agreement were:
* Total player compensation increased by slightly more than 50%. While most of this increase went to star players, all players benefited to some degree, and both sides were interested mainly in limiting, if not eliminating, overseas play by the league&#x27;s top players.
* Players were able to reach unrestricted free agency a year earlier than before. The previous CBA allowed a team to designate a player as &quot;core&quot;—similar to the NFL&#x27;s franchise tag—four times. This dropped to three in 2020 and will drop further to two in 2022.
* All player air travel to regular-season games would be, at a minimum, premium economy class. Also, each player would have her own hotel room for road games.
* Players would receive their full salary while on maternity leave. Additionally, an annual childcare stipend of $5,000 per player would be provided; teams would make apartments of at least two bedrooms available to players with children, and add facilities for nursing mothers; and the league would offer family planning benefits that would allow up to a $60,000 reimbursement for veteran players for expenses related to adoption, surrogacy, embryo preservation, or infertility treatment.
* The CBA would begin penalizing veteran players for late arrival at WNBA training camps. By the sixth year of the CBA, players with more than 2 years of service who missed the start of training camp would be suspended for the season. Exceptions included serious injury, national team commitments for non-US players, college graduations, and other significant life events.
* The CBA also addressed the issue of players serving on NBA coaching staffs during the traditional basketball season. This came to a head during the 2019 offseason when the Washington Wizards, owned by the same company that owns the WNBA&#x27;s Mystics, hired Mystics player Kristi Toliver as an assistant. Under the previous CBA, teams were allowed to allocate only $50,000 per year to players as an enticement to not play overseas. Because of the Mystics&#x27; and Wizards&#x27; shared ownership, the Wizards could only pay Toliver from the Mystics&#x27; $50,000 allocation—most of which had already been committed to Elena Delle Donne, who normally did not go overseas. With the new CBA, veteran players could work as coaches in the NBA without a salary limit, regardless of the team&#x27;s ownership structure.

Also in January 2020, the WNBA announced a new in-season tournament, the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup, which would begin with the 2020 season. Each team was scheduled to play 10 Cup games during the season—specifically, the first home and road games against each team in its conference. The final Cup games were to be played in July, with the top team in the Cup standings from each conference advancing to a one-off Cup final in August.

The 2020 WNBA schedule originally included a month-long break in July and August to allow players to participate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The 2020 games were postponed until 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering the break unnecessary. On April 3, 2020, the WNBA announced that the beginning of its own schedule would be postponed. The 2020 entry draft took place as originally scheduled on April 17, although it was done remotely. No details of the revised schedule were announced as of the time of the draft, and the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup was ultimately not held in 2020.

==== 2020 season at IMG Academy ====
In June 2020, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert announced plans for the league to have a 22-game regular season, and a traditional playoff format, to be held exclusively at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. The players were housed at the Bradenton complex, and all games and practices took place there. Players had until June 25 to let their teams know whether they planned to participate.

=== &quot;Count It&quot; campaign and expansion (2021–present) ===

On March 15, 2021, an announcement was made that the WNBA would introduce a ceremonial logo, basketball, and uniforms as part of its 25th anniversary celebratory campaign called &quot;Count It&quot;. As part of the campaign, the league unveiled The W25, a list of 25 players determined to be the league&#x27;s greatest and most influential, as chosen by a panel of media and pioneering women&#x27;s players.

The delayed launch of the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup was officially announced on May 12, 2021, two days before the start of the regular season. The originally planned schedule, with the first home game and first road game of each team against each of its fellow conference members doubling as Cup games, was maintained. All Cup games within each conference were played before the league took its Olympic break after July 11. The Cup final, officially termed the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup Championship Game, involves the conference leaders in the Cup standings; its first edition was held on August 12 as the league&#x27;s first game after the Olympic break, and was streamed via Amazon Prime Video. A prize pool of $500,000 is provided for the Cup, with players on the winning team guaranteed a minimum bonus of $30,000 and those of the losing team guaranteed $10,000, with the championship game MVP receiving an extra $5,000.

In February 2022, the league raised $75 million in capital, on terms valuing the league at $475 million. Under the deal, investors received 16 percent of the league&#x27;s equity. In mid-2022, Engelbert said that the WNBA hoped to identify one or two cities for expansion either by the start of that year&#x27;s playoffs or by the end of the year, with the teams starting play as early as the 2024 season. The WNBA narrowed its list of potential cities from 100 to 20 to 10. The league would evaluate each city based on 25 metrics in the categories of viewership, fan data, psychographics, sports benchmarks, and demographics. There were constant demands for expansion as Englebert was commissioner with lottery picks cut during their first season and long-time veterans cut during training camp due to the limited number of roster spots in the league.

On September 26, 2023, &quot;The Athletic&quot; reported that the co-owners of the Golden State Warriors, Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, were finalizing an agreement to start an expansion team in San Francisco. On October 5, 2023, the agreement was formally announced. The team, which will play at Chase Center and be headquartered in Oakland, will begin playing in the 2025 season, and is the league&#x27;s first expansion team since the Atlanta Dream in 2008. There will be an expansion draft in December 2024. It was reported that the expansion fee for the team was $50 million over ten years. On the same date, WNBA commissioner Cathy Englebert said that she expected the WNBA to add a fourteenth team by 2025, and mentioned that there were groups expressing serious interest in a franchise in Toronto, Philadelphia, Denver, Portland, and Sacramento. On May 23, 2024, it was officially announced that the Kilmer Group had acquired a franchise based in Toronto that will debut in 2026. On August 31, 2024, it was reported that the Bhathal family, owners of the Portland Thorns of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL), was in negotiations to acquire a franchise based in Portland. The new Portland expansion team was officially announced on September 18, 2024 and will also debut in 2026.

==Teams==

The WNBA originated with 8 teams in 1997, and through a sequence of expansions, contractions, and relocations will consist of 13 teams as of the 2025 season and a total of 19 franchises in WNBA history.

As of the league&#x27;s 2024 season, the Las Vegas Aces (formerly the Utah Starzz and San Antonio (Silver) Stars), Los Angeles Sparks, New York Liberty, and Phoenix Mercury are the only remaining franchises that were founded in 1997.

Arenas listed below reflect those that will be in use during the 2025 season.


===Future teams===

===Timeline===



===Relocated teams===
* Orlando Miracle (1999–2002) – relocated to Uncasville, Connecticut, to become the Connecticut Sun
* Utah Starzz (1997–2002) – relocated to San Antonio to become the San Antonio Silver Stars (2003–2013), rebranded as the San Antonio Stars (2014–2017), and relocated again to Paradise, Nevada, to become the Las Vegas Aces
* Detroit Shock (1998–2009) – relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to become the Tulsa Shock (2010–2015) and then to Arlington, Texas, to become the Dallas Wings

===Folded teams===
* Charlotte Sting – 1997–2006
* Cleveland Rockers – 1997–2003
* Houston Comets – 1997–2008
* Miami Sol – 2000–2002
* Portland Fire – 2000–2002
* Sacramento Monarchs – 1997–2009

===Relationship with NBA teams===

Five current WNBA teams and two of the three future teams are affiliated with an NBA team from the same market and are known as sister teams. These teams include the Brooklyn Nets and New York Liberty, the Indiana Pacers and Fever, the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx, the Phoenix Suns and Mercury, the Washington Wizards and Mystics, the Golden State Warriors and the future Valkyries (2025), and the Toronto Raptors and the future Tempo (2026). Of these teams, only the Mystics and Tempo don&#x27;t share an arena with their NBA counterpart.

The Liberty were previously associated with the New York Knicks, having been owned by the Knicks&#x27; parent company, the Madison Square Garden Company, but the team was sold in January 2019 to a group led by Joseph Tsai, then a minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets and now sole owner of that team. The Liberty, which played at Madison Square Garden from 1997 until 2017, were then relocated from the Westchester County Center in suburban White Plains to the Nets&#x27; home arena, Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn.

Four current WNBA teams and one future team are in the same market as an NBA team, but are independently owned. The Chicago Sky are not affiliated with the Bulls and play in a separate arena than their NBA counterpart. The Detroit Shock was the sister team of the Pistons until the teams&#x27; owner sold the Shock to investors who moved the team to Tulsa, Oklahoma. The franchise relocated again in 2016, this time to the Dallas–Fort Worth metro area to become the Dallas Wings. However, the Wings are not affiliated with the Mavericks and also play in a separate arena. While the Atlanta Dream shared State Farm Arena with the Hawks from 2008 to 2016 and again in 2019, the Hawks never held any ownership stake in the WNBA team. The Los Angeles Sparks share an arena with the Los Angeles Lakers, but not ownership. However, Lakers&#x27; legend Magic Johnson has an ownership stake in the Sparks. The future Portland team plans to start play in the Trail Blazers&#x27; home of Moda Center, but does not share ownership with the NBA team; the WNBA team instead shares ownership with the city&#x27;s women&#x27;s soccer team.

The three remaining current teams do not share a market nor an arena with an NBA counterpart. The Orlando Miracle was the sister team of the Magic until the team was sold to the Mohegan Sun casino, who relocated the franchise to Connecticut to become the Sun. The Utah Starzz were affiliated with the Jazz before relocating to San Antonio as the Silver Stars in 2003. The Silver Stars (shortened to Stars in 2014) were then paired with the San Antonio Spurs from 2003 through the 2017 season, but that relationship ended in October 2017 when the Stars were bought by MGM Resorts International and moved to Las Vegas to become the Aces. The Seattle Storm was formerly the sister team of the SuperSonics, but was sold to a Seattle-based group when the SuperSonics relocated to become the Oklahoma City Thunder.

==Season format==

===Regular season===

Teams hold training camps in May. Training camps allow the coaching staff to prepare the players for the regular season and determine the 12-woman roster with which they will begin the regular season. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held.

The WNBA regular season begins in May. In 2023 and 2024, each team played 40 regular-season games, 20 each home and away. With the Golden State Valkyries joining the league in 2025, the regular season will expand to 44 games. As in the NBA, each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season.

During years in which the Summer Olympics are held, the WNBA takes a month off in the middle of the season to allow players to practice and compete with their respective national teams. During years in which the FIBA World Cup is held, the WNBA either takes a break for the World Cup or ends its season early, depending on the scheduling of the World Cup.

===Commissioner&#x27;s Cup===

The 2020 season was planned to be the first for the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup, an in-season tournament. Each team&#x27;s first home and away games against each of its conference opponents, all of which were to be played in the first half of the season, were designated as Cup games. After each team played its 10 Cup games, the top team in each conference&#x27;s Cup standings would advance to the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup Final, a single match held in August. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the tournament to be scrapped for the time being; the tournament instead launched in 2021 under the originally announced format.

The format was changed for the 2024 season. Each team now plays only one Commissioner&#x27;s Cup game against each team in its conference, with either two or three games at home and the remainder away. All games in the first half of June are Cup contests. The Cup final, which remains a single game featuring the top teams in each conference&#x27;s Cup standings, is now held near the end of June or at the start of July. Under both formats, all Cup games except the final count as regular-season games.

===All-Star Game===

In 1999, the league held its first All-Star Game, where the best players of the Eastern Conference played against the best players of the Western Conference. The West dominated play until 2006, when the East finally won a game.

In July, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual WNBA All-Star Game. The game is part of a weekend-long event, held in a selected WNBA city each year. The game is played on the selected WNBA team&#x27;s home court. Through the 2017 edition, the All-Star Game featured star players from the Western Conference facing star players from the Eastern Conference. Since 2018, conference affiliations have been ignored in team selections. During the season, voting for All-Star starters takes place among fans, WNBA players, and sports media members. The starters are selected by a weighted vote (fans 50%, players and media 25% each), while reserves are selected by the league&#x27;s head coaches. The two players with the most fan votes are named team captains, who then fill out their teams in a draft format similar to that currently used for the NBA All-Star Game.

In 2004, The Game at Radio City was held in place of a traditional All-Star Game. The 2006 All-Star Game was the first game to feature custom uniforms that match the decade anniversary logo. From 2008 through 2016, no All-Star Game was held in any Summer Olympic year. In 2010, an exhibition game (Stars at the Sun) was held. Although the 2020 Summer Olympics were postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19, no All-Star Game was played in that season. The 2021 season featured the first All-Star Game in an Olympic year since 2000; this contest featured a WNBA all-star team facing the US national team. The 2024 game used the same format as in 2021, and was also an official All-Star Game.

Shortly after the All-Star break is the trading deadline. After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline.

===Playoffs===

The WNBA Playoffs usually begin in late September, though in years of the FIBA World Cup they begin in August. In the current system, the eight best teams by the regular-season record, without regard to conference alignment, qualify for the playoffs. Since 2022, the playoffs have been held in a standard knockout format, with the first round consisting of best-of-three series and the semifinals and finals being best-of-five. Since 2021, Google has been the official sponsor of all playoff rounds except for the finals, which are sponsored by YouTube TV.

Having a higher seed offers several advantages. The higher seed will generally face a weaker team, and will have home-court advantage in each round. In 2024, all quarterfinal series used a 2–1 home-court pattern, which allowed the higher seed the opportunity to win the series without having to visit the lower seed. This in turn meant that a lower seed that won one of the first two games would host the series decider. However, the quarterfinals will return to a 1–1–1 pattern in 2025, with the higher seed hosting the first game and a potential third game.

The quarterfinals are bracketed in the normal manner for an 8-team tournament, with 1 vs. 8 and 4 vs. 5 on one side of the bracket and 2 vs. 7 and 3 vs. 6 on the other. The winners of each quarterfinal series advance to the semifinals, with the bracket not being reseeded. The semifinals use a 2–2–1 home-court pattern, meaning that the higher-seeded team will have home court in games 1, 2, and 5 while the other team plays at home in game 3 and 4. Through 2024, the finals were also played in a 2–2–1 home-court pattern. Starting in 2025, the finals will use the same 2–2–1–1–1 pattern currently used by the NBA.

===Finals===

The final playoff round, a best-of-five series between the two semifinal winners, is known as the WNBA Finals and is held annually, currently scheduled in October. Each player on the winning team receives a championship ring. Also, the league awards a WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award. From 2005 to 2024, the series followed a 2–2–1 pattern, meaning that the higher seed played at home in games 1, 2, and 5, while the lower seed played at home in games 3 and 4. The pattern will change to 2–2–1–1–1 when the Finals expand to best-of-seven in 2025.






==Players and coaches==


In 2011, a decade and a half after the launch of the WNBA, only two players remained from the league&#x27;s inaugural season in 1997: Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson. Lisa Leslie was the longest-tenured player from the 1997 draft class; she spent her entire career (1997–2009) with the Los Angeles Sparks. Sue Bird holds both of the league&#x27;s most significant longevity records—number of seasons in the league (19) and games played (580).

The members of the WNBA&#x27;s All-Decade Team were chosen in 2006 on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the WNBA from 30 nominees compiled by fans, media, coach, and player voting. The team was to comprise the 10 best and most influential players of the first decade of the WNBA, with consideration also given to sportsmanship, community service, leadership, and contribution to the growth of women&#x27;s basketball.
Players for the WNBA&#x27;s Top 15 Team were chosen in 2011 on the anniversary of the league&#x27;s fifteenth season from amongst 30 nominees compiled similarly to that of the All-Decade Team process. This process was repeated for the league&#x27;s 20th anniversary season in 2016 with the selection of the WNBA Top 20@20, and for the 25th anniversary season in 2021 with the selection of The W25.

Over 30 players have scored at least 3,000 points in their WNBA careers. Only 14 WNBA players have reached the 6,000 point milestone: Diana Taurasi, Tina Thompson, Tamika Catchings, Tina Charles, Candice Dupree, Cappie Pondexter, Sue Bird, Katie Smith, Sylvia Fowles, Candace Parker, Lisa Leslie, DeWanna Bonner, Seimone Augustus, and Lauren Jackson. The scoring average leader is Cynthia Cooper, who averaged 21.0 points per game in five seasons with the Houston Comets (1997–2000, 2003).

In 2007, Paul Westhead of the Phoenix Mercury became the first person to earn both NBA and WNBA championship rings as a coach.

In 2008, 50-year-old Nancy Lieberman became the oldest player to play in a WNBA game. She signed a seven-day contract with the Detroit Shock and played one game, tallying two assists and two turnovers in nine minutes of action. By playing in the one game Lieberman broke a record that she had set in 1997 when she was the league&#x27;s oldest player at 39. The oldest player to have participated in a full season is Diana Taurasi, who turned 42 early in the 2024 season.

Sue Bird, who played for the Seattle Storm from 2002 until her retirement in 2022 (though she missed the 2013 and 2019 seasons to injury), holds the record for career assists with 3,234 in 580 regular-season games. The record for most assists per game is currently held by Courtney Vandersloot, an American who also holds a Hungarian passport and represents that country internationally. She has averaged 6.64 assists per game during her career with the Chicago Sky (2011–2022) and New York Liberty (from 2023). Vandersloot also has six of the top seven seasons in assists per game, with 8.1 in 2017 and 2023, 8.6 in 2018 and 2021, 9.1 in 2019, and 10.0 in 2020.

=== Milestones ===

===Awards===
Around the beginning of September (or late August in Olympic and FIBA World Cup years), the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards. The Sixth Player of the Year Award (known before 2021 as the &quot;Sixth Woman&quot; award) is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league&#x27;s best defender. The Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award is awarded to the player who shows outstanding sportsmanship on and off the court. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for her team that season. The Basketball Executive of the Year Award is presented to the team executive most instrumental in his or her team&#x27;s success in that season. The newest WNBA award, first presented in 2019, is the season-long version of the WNBA Community Assist Award, presented to a player for especially meritorious community service.

Also named are the All-WNBA Teams, the All-Defensive Teams, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five players. There are two All-WNBA teams; starting with the 2022 season, each consists of five top players selected without regard to position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams; since the 2023 season, each consists of the top defenders regardless of position. Finally, there is one All-Rookie team, consisting of the top five first-year players regardless of position. (In all cases, a tie in voting may lead to a team containing six players instead of five.)

Some of these players, among them Jones, Lyttle, Penicheiro, Sabally, Sutton-Brown, and Young played U.S. college basketball.

==Rules and regulations==
Rules are governed by standard basketball rules as defined by the NBA, with a few notable exceptions:
* The three-point line is from the center of the basket, with a distance of at the corners. The main arc is essentially identical to that used by FIBA (effective October 1, 2012 for domestic competitions) and NCAA play (effective in 2019–20 in Division I and 2020–21 in Divisions II and III for men, and in 2021–22 for all women&#x27;s play). The WNBA corner distance, as measured from the center of the basket, is identical to that of the NBA; the FIBA and NCAA distance at the corners is shorter.
* The regulation WNBA ball is a minimum in circumference and weighs , smaller and lighter than the NBA ball. Since 2004, this size has been used for all senior-level women&#x27;s competitions throughout the world in full-court basketball. Competitions in the half-court 3x3 variant used the women&#x27;s ball until 2015, when a dedicated ball with the circumference of the women&#x27;s ball but the weight of the men&#x27;s ball was introduced. Wilson became the WNBA ball supplier in 2021. Prior to that year, Spalding had been the ball supplier since 1997.
* Quarters are 10 minutes in duration instead of 12.

Games are divided into four 10-minute quarters as opposed to the league&#x27;s original two 20-minute halves of play, similar to FIBA and NCAA women&#x27;s college rules.

A recent trend with new WNBA rules has been to match them with a similar NBA rule. Since the 2006 WNBA season:
* The winner of the opening jump ball shall begin the 4th quarter with the ball out of bounds. The loser shall begin with the ball out of bounds in the second and third quarters. Previously under the two-half format, both periods started with jump balls, presumably to eliminate the possibility of a team intentionally losing the opening tip to gain the opening possession of the second half. This is not a problem under the four-quarters because the winner of the opening tip gets the opening possession of the final period.
* The shot clock was decreased from 30 to 24 seconds, matching the FIBA shot clock. Starting in 2020, the last five seconds of the shot clock counted down in tenths of a second.

The 2007 WNBA season brought changes that included:
* The amount of time that a team must move the ball across the half-court line went from 10 to 8 seconds.
* A referee can grant time-outs to either a player or the coach.
* Two free throws and possession of the ball for a clear-path-to-the-basket foul. Previously only one free throw was awarded as well as possession.

In 2012, the WNBA added the block/charge arc under the basket. As of 2013 the defensive three-second rule and anti-flopping guidelines were introduced. The three-point line was also extended; in 2017, that line extended into the corners to match the NBA&#x27;s.

Since 2017, Tissot is the official timekeeper for the league, as it uses a unified game clock/shot clock system.

===Court dimensions===
==Business==

===Finance===
During the mid-2000s, the NBA spent more than $10 million per year to keep the WNBA financially solvent. In 2007, teams were estimated to be losing $1.5 million to $2 million a year. In total, the league projected losses through the 2010 season to be around $400 million. In December 2010, Donna Orender said that the league had its first-ever &quot;cash flow positive&quot; team during the 2010 season. In 2011, three teams were profitable, and in 2013, six of the league&#x27;s 12 teams reported a profit. However, in 2018, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver revealed that the WNBA had lost an average of more than $10 million annually, which would amount to at least $280 million in losses since the WNBA&#x27;s inception in 1997.

By the 2024 season, the WNBA has seen their revenue grow rapidly through a variety of avenues, such as through raising capital, re-negotiating their media rights deal, expansion fees, increased ticket sales, and establishing new strategic partnerships and sponsorships with organizations. Still, 40% of the revenue generated by the WNBA goes to the teams and the players, with the remainder going to the NBA and outside investors. Overall, the league is expected to have lost $50 million for the 2024 season.

Unlike the NBA, whose financials are more transparent, data on the financial situation of the WNBA is rarely shared with the media. What is shared most often comes via comments made to reporters by someone associated with the NBA or the WNBA. Nola Agha, professor of sports management at the University of San Francisco, claims that it is commonplace for leagues to declare losses via tax loopholes or accounting practices &quot;even if they&#x27;re cash-flow positive and even if the asset value of the business is increasing every year.&quot; She asserts that a league may be motivated to downplay their profitability so they can have access to public subsidies to fund stadiums or to use as leverage in contract negotiations with players.

===Activism===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2020 called the WNBA &quot;the most socially progressive pro league&quot;.

As the popularity of the league has grown, players have gained more voice and power to perform as activists in many fields. One of the activist players&#x27; main focuses is the inequality between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports. Many players such as Brittney Griner, Breanna Stewart, and Maya Moore have spoken about equality between gender, sexual orientation, and race. The players have also supported progressive social and political movements such as Black Lives Matter and others. The Minnesota Lynx were early advocates. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Seimone Augustus &quot;one of sports&#x27; most forward-thinking and undersung activists&quot; for her early work advocating for marriage equality and LGBTQ+ rights. Before the Lynx July 9, 2016, home game, the team held a press conference where the four co-captains wore black t-shirts with the message &quot;&quot;Change starts with us - Justice and Accountability&quot; on the front and the names of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling on the back. Castile had been murdered by police in a traffic stop three days before the game. Shortly after the George Floyd protests began, the league and union decided in 2020 to put Black Lives Matter and Say Her Name slogans on warmup gear and opening weekend uniforms. When team owner Senator Kelly Loeffler criticized the league&#x27;s support for Black Lives Matter, her team wore black T-shirts with the slogan &quot;VOTE WARNOCK&quot;, endorsing her election opponent Raphael Warnock, an African-American pastor who defeated Loeffler.

In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WNBA-led American professional sports teams in promoting the COVID-19 vaccine. Teams hosted vaccine clinics in their home arenas. In April the league and union&#x27;s Social Justice Council made a PSA, &quot;Our Health is Worth a Shot&quot;, that aired during the WNBA draft. In June 2021, the WNBA announced that 99% of its players had been fully vaccinated.

In June 2024, the documentary film &quot;Power of the Dream&quot; will be released. The film focuses on the league&#x27;s work to support Black Lives Matter and the organizing to support the election of Raphael Warnock. Sue Bird and Nneka Ogwumike are co-producers of the film along with Tracee Ellis Ross and the director Dawn Porter.

===Sponsorships===
On June 1, 2009, the Phoenix Mercury was the first team in WNBA history to announce a marquee sponsorship. The team secured a partnership with LifeLock to brand their jerseys and warm-ups. It was the first branded jersey in WNBA history. Following the expiration of the LifeLock deal, the Mercury secured a new uniform sponsorship deal with Casino Arizona and Talking Stick Resort on February 3, 2014.

Other teams eventually followed in the Mercury&#x27;s footsteps; some teams feature sponsors prominently on the front of their jerseys, while others have sponsors on the upper left-hand shoulder.

On August 22, 2011, the WNBA announced a league-wide marquee sponsorship with Boost Mobile. The deal would allow the Boost Mobile logo to be placed on eleven of the 12 teams&#x27; jerseys (excluding San Antonio) in addition to branding on the courts and in arenas. A source said the deal is a &quot;multiyear, eight-figure deal&quot;.

Before the start of the 2011 season, every team announced a new look for their uniforms. The supplier of the uniforms for the league, Adidas, upgraded all teams to new high-tech designs, much like they did for the NBA before the start of their season.

On April 8, 2019, the WNBA announced a multiyear marquee partnership with AT&amp;T, making them the first non-apparel partner to have its logo featured on the front of all 12 team jerseys. The jerseys officially debuted during the 2019 WNBA draft.

In 2020, the league launched WNBA Changemakers, a collective of businesses committed to the advancement of women in sports. The business partners that make up the collective provide direct financial investment to the WNBA as well as marketing amplification through collaborations.

===Salaries, rosters, and collective bargaining===
Before the 2009 season, the maximum team roster size was changed from 13 players (11 active and 2 inactive) to 11 players (all active). Any team that falls below nine players able to play due to injury or any other factor outside of the control of the team will, upon request, be granted a roster hardship exception allowing the team to sign an additional player or players so that the team will have nine players able to play in an upcoming game or games. As soon as the injured (or otherwise sidelined) player(s) can play, the roster hardship player(s)—not any other player on the roster—must be waived.
In March 2014, the WNBA and players signed a new, eight-year collective bargaining agreement, increasing the number of players on a roster to 12.

The WNBA draft is held annually every spring. The minimum age is 22 years for American players and 20 years for international players, measured as of December 31 of the calendar year of the draft. For draft purposes, &quot;American&quot; includes those born in the U.S., as well as those who have enrolled in a U.S. college or university, regardless of their citizenship. The draft is three rounds long, with each of the 12 teams in the league (trades aside) getting three picks each. The draft order for the eight teams that made the playoffs the previous year are based on team records, and the team with the highest previous record will pick last. For the remaining top four picks, a selection process similar to the NBA draft lottery is conducted for the four teams that did not qualify for the playoffs.

Previously, in 2008, a new six-year collective bargaining agreement was agreed upon between the players and the league. The salary cap for an entire team in 2010 was $827,000 (although it was later lowered to $775,000). By 2013 (the sixth year under this agreement), the cap for an entire team was $900,000. In 2010, the &quot;minimum&quot; salary for a player with three-plus years of experience was $51,000 while the &quot;maximum&quot; salary for a six-plus year player was $101,500 (the first time in league history that players can receive over $100,000). The minimum salary for rookies was $35,190. Many WNBA players supplement their salaries by playing in European, Australian, or more recently Chinese women&#x27;s basketball leagues during the WNBA offseason. The WNBA pays its female players less than their NBA counterparts, although this is attributed to the much greater revenues of the NBA; however the WNBA has been criticized for &quot;paying its players a lower share of revenue than the NBA&quot;.

The decision of superstar Diana Taurasi to sit out the 2015 WNBA season was seen by some in the media as a harbinger of salary-related troubles in the future. The Russian club for which she was playing at the time, UMMC Ekaterinburg, offered her a bonus well over the league&#x27;s maximum player salary to sit out that season. Taurasi accepted, largely because she had not had an offseason since playing college basketball more than a decade earlier. Such offers have often been made to star American players, including Taurasi herself, but none were accepted until Taurasi did so in 2015.

A more recent incident that led to widespread media comment on the WNBA&#x27;s salary structure was the torn Achilles suffered by reigning WNBA MVP Breanna Stewart while playing for another Russian side, Dynamo Kursk, in the 2019 EuroLeague Women final. The injury came at a time when the WNBA and its players&#x27; union were preparing to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement, following the union&#x27;s announcement in November 2018 that it would opt out of the current CBA after the 2019 season. With overseas leagues offering much higher salaries to many players than the WNBA currently provides, roughly 70% of the league&#x27;s players go overseas in any given season. While these players do not necessarily play as many games as NBA players do in their seasons, even participants in the NBA Finals get several months of rest in the offseason, something not available for WNBA players who also play overseas. In a story on the ramifications of Stewart&#x27;s injury, Michael Voepel of ESPN had this to say about the lead-in to the injury:

The current CBA, which took effect in 2020, significantly increased minimum and maximum salaries. The minimum league salary in 2020 was $57,000 for players with less than three years of experience, and $68,000 otherwise. For most players, the 2020 maximum salary was $185,000; players who met specified criteria for league service had a maximum of $215,000.

WNBA players are awarded bonuses for certain achievements. Some of the bonuses given by the league (amount is per player), from 2020 to 2027 (the duration of the current CBA):
WNBA champion: $11,356; Runner-up: $5,678; Most Valuable Player: $15,450; All-WNBA First Team member: $10,300; and All-Star Game participant: $2,575. These were only modest increases from amounts provided before 2020.

In recent years, the lack of roster space for rookies, thus hampering their professional development, has become a major issue. While the 2020 CBA led to maximum player salaries nearly doubling from 2019 to 2022, the team cap only increased by slightly less than 40% in that period. Because the cap is a hard cap, many WNBA teams now carry only 11 players on their rosters instead of the maximum 12, leading Stewart to state &quot;We&#x27;re at a tipping point. . . . without some easy tweaks, we are no longer a league that has 12 teams and 144 players — it&#x27;s more like 133.&quot; The WNBA also has no developmental league similar to the NBA G League; Chiney Ogwumike, a vice president of the players&#x27; union, publicly called for such a league. While roster limits have always been a significant issue in the league—between the first WNBA draft in 1997 and 2021, more than 40% of drafted players never made a roster—this became especially apparent at the dawn of the 2020s. In one notable example, the 2019 Naismith Trophy winner Megan Gustafson did not make an opening-day roster in 2019, and had only played in parts of the 2019–2021 seasons before being cut in the 2022 preseason. This issue gained major publicity during the week before the start of the 2022 season. The Minnesota Lynx, which began that week with barely over $12,000 of cap room, cut six players, including the 2020 Rookie of the Year Crystal Dangerfield, their 2021 first-round pick Rennia Davis, and both of their 2022 draft picks. The Seattle Storm, whose first 2022 draft pick was in the middle of the second round, waived that pick (Elissa Cunane), and the Las Vegas Aces waived both of their picks, one of them a first-rounder.

Another clause in the 2020 CBA, known as the &quot;prioritization&quot; clause, has been viewed as a potential problem for the league. Because of overseas league commitments, a significant number of WNBA players have reported late to training camp each season. Several overseas leagues and continental club competitions overlap with WNBA training camps, and even with the start of the WNBA season. For example, 55 WNBA players missed the start of training camp in 2021, meaning that most teams were unable to start practice with their full rosters. Starting in 2023, teams are required to fine players with more than two years of WNBA experience who miss the start of training camp. (Exemptions are provided for national team commitments, graduations, and other significant life events.) Starting in 2024, the league can penalize a veteran player who does not report to camp with a season-long suspension without pay. In a 2021 episode of a podcast hosted by Napheesa Collier and A&#x27;ja Wilson, Collier raised the prospect of players choosing to abandon the WNBA for higher overseas salaries, telling Wilson &quot;If I&#x27;m not making that much in the league, if it&#x27;s not enough for me to survive on during the year, I&#x27;m going overseas and having the summer off.&quot; When Stewart re-signed with the Seattle Storm as a free agent before the 2022 season, she cited the prioritization clause as the reason she only signed a one-year contract.

==== Player revenue ====
There are many factors that play into the smaller wages WNBA players receive during their season, but two major contributors are revenue and viewership numbers and the allocation of funds by both the NBA and the WNBA. It is estimated that wages for NBA players take up 50% of the league&#x27;s annual revenue, while WNBA players only receive 20% of their league&#x27;s income. Kelsey Plum said in an interview with The Residency Podcast, &quot;We&#x27;re not asking to get paid what the men get paid. We&#x27;re asking to get paid the same percentage of revenue shared.&quot;

==== Viewership ====
In sports, revenue and viewership are indicators of how much money the sport is generating. It can be brought in through sales such as tickets and merchandise, as well as how many spectators are broadcasting the game. The salary of players and the finances that go into maintaining the sport depend on viewership. Without revenue and viewership, it is difficult to uphold and maintain sporting facilities and equipment. In 2019, it was reported that the total revenue the WNBA brought in was $102 million. New data shows that in 2023, the league and teams together are estimated to bring in around $180 million to $200 million in revenue.

The WNBA&#x27;s audience has increased by 67% halfway through the 2023 season, with an average of 556,184 viewers per game. Their social media presence has also risen in popularity, garnering more than 24 million views across all social media platforms. With increased media attention on women&#x27;s basketball, Commissioner Cathy Engelbert announced in May 2024 that the league would allocate $50 million over two years to fund charter flights for players.

==== Player marketing agreements ====

Player marketing agreements are contracts that allow WNBA players to bring in more individual revenue by promoting the WNBA year-round. As of 2022, there are 10 players who have signed PMAs: Diamond DeShields, Dearica Hamby, Napheesa Collier, DiDi Richards, Arike Ogunbowale, Kahleah Copper, Ariel Atkins, Jasmine Thomas, Kelsey Mitchell, and Izzy Harrison. The league is expected to spend $1 million on PMAs annually, and this funding is divided between the players who have signed contracts, with a salary cap of $250,000. While this is a way for players to make more money during their off-season, it is also a way for the league to keep players from going overseas, as they become tied to the WNBA and are unable to play in leagues in Europe and elsewhere. Players choose to sign PMAs for many different reasons, ranging anywhere from injuries sustained in-season that need to be rested to childcare responsibilities. These agreements are still in their infancy stage and need further developing and funding to become a viable option for more WNBA players who are looking to increase their revenue.

==== NBA support ====
The WNBA is half-owned by the NBA and receives between $10-$15 million dollars annually to subsidize the league from the NBA&#x27;s yearly revenue, which in 2022, reached up to $10 billion. Six WNBA teams are considered sister teams to the NBA teams based in the same areas and are directly connected to those NBA teams and their markets. The NBA&#x27;s allotment of funding to all WNBA teams, not just sister teams, has been discussed in many academic and sports analysis circles, with some authors arguing that the NBA should be doing more to support the WNBA if they want the league to succeed. Sponsorship and television deals continue to be an area where the WNBA creates less revenue than their NBA counterparts, with the WNBA bringing in $25 million from ESPN and the NBA bringing in $930 million from ESPN and TNT. Some argue that the NBA could be working harder to bridge that gap between organizations and either share more revenue from deals or help the WNBA create their own more profitable agreements.

In July 2024, the WNBA negotiated a new media rights deal as part of a total package with the NBA valued at $77 billion. Prior to re-negotiating their deal, the WNBA media rights were only valued at $60 million a year. Under the new deal, the WNBA can expect to earn $200 million a year for the next eleven years, more than a 300% increase over previous years, but because the media deal lumps the NBA together with the WNBA, the true valuation of the WNBA media rights remains unknown.

===Merchandise===
The following shows the top jersey sales during the 2021 regular season, based on sales through the WNBA&#x27;s official online store.

However, a story by NBC Sports journalist Alex Azzi argued that the WNBA&#x27;s merchandise rankings were misleading for multiple reasons.
* At any given time, the WNBA has at most 144 players, but at the time of the story, &quot;ready to ship&quot; replica team jerseys were available for fewer than 20 of them. Many of the league&#x27;s top players in the 2021 season were not among those with &quot;ready to ship&quot; jerseys. The only such jersey available for Jonquel Jones, who would be named league MVP shortly after the story ran, was a replica of the jersey she wore in that season&#x27;s All-Star Game, and not her Connecticut Sun jersey. The league&#x27;s leading scorer that season, Tina Charles, had no ready-made jersey available for sale. Also, not all of the ready-made jerseys were available in youth sizes. All other player replica jerseys must be custom-ordered, which take longer to ship, cost more, and are only available in adult sizes. The only Minnesota Lynx player with a ready-made jersey, Maya Moore, had not played in the league since 2018 (and would formally announce her retirement in 2023).
* Some teams, among them the Lynx, offer a larger variety of ready-made replica jerseys in their online team stores. Also, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, which had entered into a multi-year marketing agreement with the league shortly before the story ran, has a wider availability of such jerseys than the WNBA online store. However, the league&#x27;s official merchandise rankings do not include sales through any outlets other than its online store.
* While over 80% of WNBA players are black, the top three on this list, as well as four of the top five, are white. A study by two researchers at the University of Massachusetts published earlier in 2021 concluded that after controlling for points and rebounds, white players individually averaged twice as much media mentions as black players during the 2020 season. This discrepancy was specifically called out by white UConn superstar Paige Bueckers during her acceptance speech at the 2021 ESPY Awards, and Azzi argued that it contributed to the perceived racial bias in the WNBA merchandise rankings.

The following shows the top teams in merchandise sales during the 2021 regular season.

===Presidents / Commissioners===
The title of the league&#x27;s chief executive was &quot;President&quot; before Cathy Engelbert became the first &quot;Commissioner&quot;.
* Val Ackerman, 1996–2005
* Donna Orender, 2005–2010
* Chris Granger, 2011 
* Laurel J. Richie, 2011–2015
* Lisa Borders, 2015–2018
* Mark Tatum, 2018–2019 
* Cathy Engelbert, 2019–present

==Attendance==

In the inaugural 1997 WNBA season, average attendance for the regular season was 9,661 attendants with 112 games played. Average attendance increased by 12% the following year in 1998 over 150 games. By 2000, the regular WNBA season consisted of 256 games and attendance dropped with an average of 9,142 attendants per game for season 2000-2003. Beginning in 2003, attendance dropped at a rate of approximately 5% year-over-year until 2006 when average attendance was 7,479. From 2007 to 2014, attendance numbers remained relatively steady with a low of 7,457 in 2012 and a high of 8,039 in 2009.

In 2015, the WNBA&#x27;s attendance per game decreased by 3.4% to 7,318. This was a record low for the WNBA since it was established in 1997. The relocation of the San Antonio Stars to Freeman Coliseum and the Tulsa Shock to Arlington likely contributed to particularly large drops in attendance in 2015 (−37.4% and −7.2% respectively). With record low attendance, the WNBA sought to improve their branding effort for the following 20th anniversary season and the WNBA President, Laurel J. Richie, discussed creating an expansion committee to evaluate if and how the WNBA should go about expanding their reach.

Attendance in 2016 and 2017 recovered slightly with average attendance at 7,655 and 7,716 respectively, but the 2018 and 2019 seasons each set the lowest average attendance in WNBA history (6,769 and 6,535 respectively). However, about half of the decline in attendance from 2017 to 2018 was due to the New York Liberty moving from 19,812-seat Madison Square Garden to the 5,000-seat Westchester County Center. While the Liberty had averaged over 9,000 fans in 2017, James Dolan, then the team&#x27;s owner, noted that roughly half of the team&#x27;s attendance in that season came from complimentary tickets. Similarly in 2019, the Washington Mystics moved from the 20,356-seat Capital One Arena to the 4,111-seat Entertainment and Sports Arena. The Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty each saw double-digit percentage losses in 2019, but half of the league&#x27;s teams saw attendance increases in that season, and the number of sellouts was the same in both seasons (41).

With plans to expand the number of games played by each team from 34 to 36 regular season games, and with the introduction of the mid-season Commissioner&#x27;s Cup tournament to be broadcast on ESPN and ABC, the league had high hopes for the 2020 WNBA season, but that was derailed when the season was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic on April 3. Instead, the league held an abbreviated 22-game regular season at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, with no fans in attendance. The 2021 WNBA season was also shortened to a 32-game regular season and attendance numbers remained low with an average of 2,620 people in attendance per game, likely due to persistent fears around the COVID-19 virus and new protocols put in place for large indoor venues. By 2022, average attendance had rebounded to 5,646 and in 2023 attendance had recovered to pre-pandemic numbers with 6,615 average attendance per game.

2024 turned out to be a breakout season for WNBA attendance, with an average of 9,807 fans per game and an increase of 48% over the 2023 season. Three games drew more than 20,000 fans during the 2024 season, including a record-breaking attendance of 20,711 fans when the Indiana Fever visited the Washington Mystics on September 19. A surge in interest in women&#x27;s college basketball preceded the 2024 WNBA season, with viewership of the 2024 women&#x27;s NCAA championship game up over 90% from the previous season and marking the first time in NCAA history where viewership for the women&#x27;s championship game exceeded the men&#x27;s. Sports analysts cite intense interest in the incoming 2024 rookie class, led by number one draft pick Caitlin Clark, as the reason for the dramatic increases in attendance, dubbing her ability to drive up ticket sales &quot;Clarkonomics&quot;.






==Media coverage==

Currently, WNBA games are televised throughout the U.S. by ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, Ion Television, NBATV, CBS, and CBS Sports Network.

In the early years, two women-oriented networks, Lifetime and Oxygen, also broadcast games, including the first game of the WNBA. NBC showed games from 1997 to 2002 as part of their &quot;NBA on NBC&quot; coverage before the league transferred the rights to ABC/ESPN.

In June 2007, the WNBA signed a contract extension with ESPN, the first agreement to pay television rights fees to a women&#x27;s professional league. The new television deal runs from 2009 to 2016. A minimum of 18 games will be broadcast on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 each season; the rights to broadcast the first regular-season game and the All-Star game are held by ABC. Additionally, a minimum of 11 postseason games will be broadcast on any of the three networks. Along with this deal, came the first-ever rights fees to be paid to a women&#x27;s professional sports league. Over the eight years of the contract, &quot;millions and millions of dollars&quot; will be &quot;dispersed to the league&#x27;s teams&quot;.

In 2013, the WNBA and ESPN signed a six-year extension on the broadcast deal to cover 2017–2022. In the new deal, a total of 30 games would be shown each season on ESPN networks. Each team would receive around $1 million per year.

On April 22, 2019, CBS Sports Network reached a multi-year deal to televise 40 regular-season weekend and primetime WNBA games, beginning in the 2019 season.

On April 20, 2023, Ion Television signed a multi-year deal with the WNBA to air a 15-week slate of doubleheader games on Friday nights (branded as &quot;WNBA Friday Night Spotlight on ION&quot;), beginning with that year&#x27;s regular season. It will be the first national sports broadcast carried by Ion since 2011, and marks the first ever television contract for Scripps Sports, which was founded by the E. W. Scripps Company in December 2022 to acquire sports events for Ion and the group&#x27;s local television stations. The agreement also grants local rights to selected Ion O&amp;Os for games involving regional WNBA teams, which stations may carry in early- or late-evening broadcast windows depending on tip-off time. The first broadcast was on May 26, 2023, when the Washington Mystics visited the Chicago Sky.

Starting in 2026, the WNBA will begin a new 11-year agreement that will see games return to NBC Sports, as well as remain on ESPN/ABC and Amazon Prime Video. With this new deal, the league will distribute more than 125 games nationally (a minimum of 25 across ESPN/ABC, 50 across NBC platforms, and 30 on Prime Video) and worldwide. ESPN continues on as the league&#x27;s All-Star and Draft broadcaster, Prime Video continues as the broadcaster for the league&#x27;s Commissioner&#x27;s Cup games, and NBC will pick up rights to all USA Basketball games. In addition, the WNBA Playoffs and Finals will see a wider distribution across the three partners, where each partner airs a first round series annually (two on ESPN/ABC and one each on NBC platforms and Prime Video), and rotates turns airing the semifinals and Finals (eight semifinals and five Finals on ESPN/ABC and seven semifinals and three Finals on NBC platforms and Prime Video). The WNBA also stated that they are expected to add additional media partners prior to the first year of the new deal.

Some teams offer games on local radio, while all teams have some games broadcast on local television stations:

*Atlanta – FanDuel Sports South, FanDuel Sports Southeast
*Chicago – WCIU-TV, WMEU-CD, Marquee Sports Network
*Connecticut – NESN, WCCT-TV
*Dallas – FanDuel Sports Southwest
*Indiana – FanDuel Sports Indiana
*Las Vegas – KVVU
*Los Angeles – Spectrum SportsNet
*Minnesota – FanDuel Sports North
*New York – WNYW, WWOR
*Phoenix – KTVK, KPHE
*Seattle – KZJO, KCPQ
*Washington – Monumental Sports Network
===WNBA League Pass===

In 2009, the WNBA announced the launch of &quot;WNBA LiveAccess&quot;, a feature on WNBA.com that provides fans with access to more than 200 live game webcasts throughout the WNBA season. All of the &quot;WNBA LiveAccess&quot; games are then archived for on-demand viewing. Most games (except broadcasts on ABC, ESPN or ESPN2, which are available on ESPN3) are available via this system. The first use of LiveAccess was the E League versus Chicago Sky preseason game.

Before the 2011 season, LiveAccess was given an overhaul, and the system became more reliable and many new features were added. Before the 2012 season, it was announced that users of LiveAccess would have to pay a $4.99 subscription fee to use the service. In 2013, this was increased to $14.99. In 2014 the streaming service was renamed WNBA League Pass.

WNBA League Pass is available as part of the WNBA App, the free mobile application available on the iPhone, iPad and Android devices and costs US$16.99 for the season. Games airing on ESPN, ESPN2 and CBS Sports Network, as well as other games taking place during the telecast windows of ESPN and ESPN2 games, are not available live on WNBA League Pass. However, those games will be available on-demand shortly after the conclusion of their live broadcast.

===Viewership===
On the 2008 season opening day (May 17), ABC broadcast the Los Angeles Sparks and Phoenix Mercury matchup to showcase new rookie sensation Candace Parker. The game received a little over 1 million viewers. In 2008, WNBA games averaged just 413,000 viewers, compared to 1.46 million viewers on ESPN and over 2.2 million on ABC for NBA games. In addition, WNBA games have much poorer visibility, attendance, and ratings than NCAA games.

In 2011, the regular-season broadcast drew 270,000 viewers, an increase of 5% over the 2010 season. As sponsorships continued to grow with deals from ESPN to air WNBA games on ESPN and ESPN2. The league did experience some success on the digital forefront. In 2015, WNBA.com saw a 26% increase in mobile page views, along with a major increase in its social media space; WNBA Instagram grew by 51% that year.

ESPN viewership grew 35% in 2018 over 2017. This became the impetus for the multi-year partnership in which CBS Sports Network would broadcast live WNBA games beginning with the 2019 season. The 2023 season broke viewership and attendance records. Viewership was up 21% compared to the 2022 season within the four national televised networks. (ABC, ESPN, CBS &amp; ESPN2) Attendance was up 16% compared to the previous season and the average game attendance per fan was 6,615 which is the highest since 2018.

The 2024 WNBA regular season set an all-time record with more than 54 million unique viewers and a record 22 games that garnered more than one million viewers each. With an 170% increase in viewership over the 2023 season, the 2024 regular season was the most-viewed season ever across ESPN platforms with an average of 1.19 million viewers per game.

==All-time franchise history (through 2024)==
==Offseason==
In July 2023, Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart announced Unrivaled, a women&#x27;s professional three-on-three basketball league. The league was founded, in part, to allow WNBA players to play domestically and to bypass complications from the WNBA&#x27;s prioritization rule for players who choose to play overseas in the WNBA offseason. Unrivaled&#x27;s inaugural season, consisting of six teams of six players is slotted to begin in January 2025 in the Miami-area community of Medley, Florida.

<text>Agoraphobia is a mental and behavioral disorder, specifically an anxiety disorder characterized by symptoms of anxiety in situations where the person perceives their environment to be unsafe with no easy way to escape. These situations can include public transit, shopping centers, crowds and queues, or simply being outside their home on their own. Being in these situations may result in a panic attack. Those affected will go to great lengths to avoid these situations. In severe cases, people may become completely unable to leave their homes.
Agoraphobia is believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The condition often runs in families, and stressful or traumatic events such as the death of a parent or being attacked may be a trigger. In the DSM-5, agoraphobia is classified as a phobia along with specific phobias and social phobia. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and major depressive disorder. The diagnosis of agoraphobia has been shown to be comorbid with depression, substance abuse, and suicide ideation.
Without treatment, it is uncommon for agoraphobia to resolve. Treatment is typically with a type of counselling called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT results in resolution for about half of people. In some instances, those with a diagnosis of agoraphobia have reported taking benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. Agoraphobia affects about 1.7% of adults. Women are affected about twice as often as men. The condition is rare in children, often begins in adolescence or early adulthood, and becomes more common at age 65 or above.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;agoraphobia&quot; was coined in German in 1871 by pioneering German psychologist Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890), in his article &quot;&quot;. &quot;Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten&quot;, Berlin, 1871–72; 3: 138–161. It is derived from Greek (), meaning or and (), meaning .

== Signs and symptoms ==
Agoraphobia is a condition where individuals become anxious in unfamiliar environments or where they perceive that they have little control. Triggers for this anxiety may include wide-open spaces, crowds (social anxiety), or traveling (even short distances). Agoraphobia is often, but not always, compounded by a fear of social embarrassment, as a person experiencing agoraphobia fears the onset of a panic attack and appearing distraught in public. Most of the time they avoid these areas and stay in the comfort of a known, controllable space, usually their home.

Agoraphobia is also defined as &quot;a fear, sometimes terrifying, by those who have experienced one or more panic attacks&quot;. In these cases, the patient is fearful of a particular place because they have previously experienced a panic attack at the same location. Fearing the onset of another panic attack, the patient is fearful or avoids a location. Some refuse to leave their homes in medical emergencies because the fear of being outside of their comfort areas is too great.

The person with this condition can sometimes go to great lengths to avoid the locations where they have experienced the onset of a panic attack. Agoraphobia, as described in this manner, is a symptom professionals check when making a diagnosis of panic disorder. Other syndromes like obsessive–compulsive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder can also cause agoraphobia. Any irrational fear that keeps one from going outside can cause the syndrome.

People with agoraphobia may experience temporary separation anxiety disorder when certain individuals of the household depart from the residence temporarily, such as a parent or spouse, or when they are left home alone. These situations can result in an increase in anxiety or a panic attack or feeling the need to separate themselves from family or friends.

People with agoraphobia sometimes fear waiting outside for long periods of time; that symptom can be called &quot;macrophobia&quot;.

=== Panic attacks ===
Agoraphobia patients can experience sudden panic attacks when traveling to places where they fear they are out of control, help would be difficult to obtain, or they could be embarrassed. During a panic attack, epinephrine is released in large amounts, triggering the body&#x27;s natural fight-or-flight response. A panic attack typically has an abrupt onset, building to maximum intensity within 10 to 15 minutes, and rarely lasts longer than 30 minutes. Symptoms of a panic attack include palpitations, rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tightness in the throat, and shortness of breath. Many patients report a fear of dying, fear of losing control of emotions, or fear of losing control of behaviors.

== Causes ==
Agoraphobia is believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The condition often runs in families, and stressful or traumatic events such as the death of a parent or being attacked may be a trigger.

Research has uncovered a link between agoraphobia and difficulties with spatial orientation. Individuals without agoraphobia are able to maintain balance by combining information from their vestibular system, their visual system, and their proprioceptive sense. A disproportionate number of agoraphobics have weak vestibular function and consequently rely more on visual or tactile signals. They may become disoriented when visual cues are sparse (as in wide-open spaces) or overwhelming (as in crowds). Likewise, they may be confused by sloping or irregular surfaces.

In a virtual reality study, agoraphobics showed impaired processing of changing audiovisual data in comparison with subjects without agoraphobia.

=== Substance-induced ===
Chronic use of tranquilizers and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines has been linked to onset of agoraphobia. In 10 patients who had developed agoraphobia during benzodiazepine dependence, symptoms abated within the first year of assisted withdrawal. Similarly, alcohol use disorders are associated with panic with or without agoraphobia; this association may be due to the long-term effects of alcohol consumption causing a distortion in brain chemistry.

Tobacco smoking has also been associated with the development and emergence of agoraphobia, often with panic disorder; it is uncertain how tobacco smoking results in anxiety-panic with or without agoraphobia symptoms, but the direct effects of nicotine dependence or the effects of tobacco smoke on breathing have been suggested as possible causes. Self-medication or a combination of factors may also explain the association between tobacco smoking and agoraphobia and panic.

=== Attachment theory ===

Some scholars have explained agoraphobia as an attachment deficit, i.e., the temporary loss of the ability to tolerate spatial separations from a secure base. Recent empirical research has also linked attachment and spatial theories of agoraphobia.

=== Spatial theory ===
In the social sciences, a perceived clinical bias exists in agoraphobia research. Branches of the social sciences, especially geography, have increasingly become interested in what may be thought of as a spatial phenomenon. One such approach links the development of agoraphobia with modernity. Factors considered contributing to agoraphobia within modernity are the ubiquity of cars and urbanization. These have helped develop the expansion of public space and the contraction of private space, thus creating a conflict in the mind of agoraphobic individuals.

=== Evolutionary Perspectives ===
Some evolutionary models propose that agoraphobia—like other specific phobias—may be rooted in adaptive mechanisms that helped early humans avoid threats in open or unfamiliar environments. From this viewpoint, fear and avoidance behaviors could have been selectively favored if they aided survival—for instance, by prompting individuals to steer clear of potentially dangerous surroundings or minimize exposure to predators and pathogens. According to preparedness models, human defensive systems are especially sensitive to cues linked to ancestral threats and can rapidly form strong, lasting fear associations with them. In modern life, such defenses might become mismatched to relatively low-risk environments, producing disproportionate anxiety responses.

An additional evolutionary psychology view is that the more unusual primary agoraphobia without panic attacks may be due to a different mechanism from agoraphobia with panic attacks. Primary agoraphobia without panic attacks may be a specific phobia explained by it once having been evolutionarily advantageous to avoid exposed, large, open spaces without cover or concealment. Agoraphobia with panic attacks may be an avoidance response secondary to the panic attacks, due to fear of the situations in which the panic attacks occurred.

== Diagnosis ==
Most people who present to mental health specialists develop agoraphobia after the onset of panic disorder. Agoraphobia is best understood as an adverse behavioral outcome of repeated panic attacks and subsequent anxiety and preoccupation with these attacks that leads to an avoidance of situations where a panic attack could occur. Early treatment of panic disorder can often prevent agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is typically determined when symptoms are worse than panic disorder, but also do not meet the criteria for other mental disorders such as depression.

=== Agoraphobia without history of panic disorder ===
Agoraphobia without a history of panic disorder (also called primary agoraphobia) is an anxiety disorder where the individual with the diagnosis does not meet the DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder. Agoraphobia typically develops as a result of having panic disorder. In a small minority of cases, however, agoraphobia can develop by itself without being triggered by the onset of panic attacks. Agoraphobia can be caused by traumatic experiences, such as bullying or abuse. Historically, there has been debate over whether agoraphobia without panic genuinely existed, or whether it was simply a manifestation of other disorders such as panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and social phobia. One researcher said: &quot;out of 41 agoraphobics seen (at a clinic) during a period of 1 year, only 1 fit the diagnosis of agoraphobia without panic attacks, and even this particular classification was questionable...Do not expect to see too many agoraphobics without panic&quot;. In spite of this earlier skepticism, current thinking is that agoraphobia without panic disorder is indeed a valid, unique illness which has gone largely unnoticed, since those with the condition are far less likely to seek clinical treatment.

According to the DSM-IV-TR, a widely-used manual for diagnosing mental disorders, the condition is diagnosed when agoraphobia is present without panic disorder where symptoms are not caused by or are unreasonable to an underlying medical problem or pharmacological influence. The DSM-5 decoupled agoraphobia and panic disorder, making them separate disorders that can be diagnosed together.

== Treatments ==
=== Therapy ===
Systematic desensitization can provide lasting relief to the majority of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia. The disappearance of residual and sub-clinical agoraphobic avoidance, and not simply of panic attacks, should be the aim of exposure therapy. Many patients can deal with exposure easier if they are in the company of a friend on whom they can rely. In this approach, it is suggested that people being treated remain in the situation that provokes anxiety until the symptoms anxiety have subsided because if they leave the situation, the phobic response will not decrease and it may even rise.

A related exposure treatment is exposure, a cognitive behavioral therapy method, that gradually exposes patients to the feared situations or objects. This treatment was largely effective with an effect size from &quot;d =&quot; 0.78 to &quot;d =&quot; 1.34, and these effects were shown to increase over time, proving that the treatment had long-term efficacy (up to 12 months after treatment).

Psychological interventions in combination with pharmaceutical treatments were overall more effective than treatments simply involving either CBT or pharmaceuticals. Further research showed there was no significant effect between using group CBT versus individual CBT.

Cognitive restructuring has also proved useful in treating agoraphobia. This treatment involves coaching a participant through a dianoetic discussion, with the intent of replacing irrational, counterproductive beliefs with more factual and beneficial ones.

Relaxation techniques are often useful skills for the agoraphobic to develop, as they can be used to stop or prevent symptoms of anxiety and panic.

Videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP) is an emerging modality used to treat various disorders in a remote method. Similar to traditional face-to-face interventions, VCP can be used to administer CBT.

Virtual reality computer stimulated therapy has been suggested to help people with psychosis and agoraphobia manage their avoidance of outside environments. In the therapy, the user wears a headset and a virtual character provides psychological advice and guides them as they explore simulated environments (such as a cafe or a busy street).

=== Medications ===
Antidepressant medications most commonly used to treat anxiety disorders are mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed for treatment of agoraphobia. Antidepressants are important because some have anxiolytic effects. Antidepressants should be used in conjunction with exposure as a form of self-help or with cognitive behaviour therapy. A combination of medication and cognitive behaviour therapy is sometimes the most effective treatment for agoraphobia.

=== Alternative medicine ===
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has been studied as a possible treatment for agoraphobia, with poor results. As such, EMDR is only recommended in cases where cognitive-behavioral approaches have proven ineffective or in cases where agoraphobia has developed following trauma.

Many people with anxiety disorders benefit from joining a self-help or support group (telephone conference-call support groups or online support groups being of particular help for completely housebound individuals). Sharing problems and achievements with others, as well as sharing various self-help tools, are common activities in these groups. In particular, stress management techniques and various kinds of meditation practices and visualization techniques can help people with anxiety disorders calm themselves and may enhance the effects of therapy, as can service to others, which can distract from the self-absorption that tends to go with anxiety problems. Also, preliminary evidence suggests aerobic exercise may have a calming effect. Since caffeine, certain illicit drugs, and even some over-the-counter cold medications can aggravate the symptoms of anxiety disorders, they should be avoided.

== Epidemiology ==
Agoraphobia occurs about twice as commonly among women as it does in men. It can develop at any age but is much more common in adolescence and early adulthood and occurs more often in people of above average intelligence.

Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia affects roughly 5.1% of Americans, and about 1/3 of this population with panic disorder have co-morbid agoraphobia. It is uncommon to have agoraphobia without panic attacks, with only 0.17% of people with agoraphobia not presenting panic disorders as well.

<doc id="57724" wikidata="Q1681020" url="?curid=57724" title="James Randi Educational Foundation">
<text>The James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) is an American grant-making institution founded in 1996 by magician and skeptic James Randi. As a nonprofit organization, the mission of JREF includes educating the public and the media on the dangers of accepting unproven claims, and to support research into paranormal claims in controlled scientific experimental conditions. The organization announced its change to a grant-making foundation in September 2015.

The organization previously administered the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, a prize of one million U.S. dollars to anyone who could demonstrate a supernatural or paranormal ability under agreed-upon scientific testing criteria.

The organization has been funded through member contributions, grants, and conferences, though it ceased accepting memberships after 2015. For several years, the JREF website published the blog &quot;Swift&quot;, which included news and information as well as exposés of paranormal claimants.

==History==

The James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) officially came into existence on February 29, 1996, when it was registered as a nonprofit corporation in the State of Delaware in the United States. On April 3, 1996, James Randi formally announced the creation of JREF through his email hotline.

JREF is now headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia.

Randi stated that Johnny Carson was a major sponsor, giving several six-figure donations.

From 2003 to 2015, JREF annually hosted The Amazing Meeting (styled as The Amaz!ng Meeting), a gathering of scientists, skeptics, and atheists. Perennial speakers included Richard Dawkins, Penn &amp; Teller, Phil Plait, Michael Shermer, and Adam Savage.

In 2008, the astronomer Philip Plait became the new president of JREF, and Randi became its board chairman. In December 2009, Plait left JREF due to involvement in a television project, and D.J. Grothe assumed the position of president on January 1, 2010, holding the position until his departure from the organization was announced on September 1, 2014.

The San Francisco newspaper &quot;SF Weekly&quot; reported in August 2009, that Randi&#x27;s annual salary was about $200,000.

Randi resigned from JREF in 2015.

As of January 2024, JREF leadership consisted of:
* President: Banachek (Steven Shaw) of Las Vegas, Nevada
* Secretary: Daniel Denman of Silver Spring, Maryland
* Treasurer / Assistant Secretary: Richard L. Adams Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, Florida

==One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge==

In 1964, Randi began offering a prize of US$1,000 to anyone who could demonstrate a paranormal ability under agreed-upon testing conditions. This prize was later increased to US$1million in bonds and was administered by JREF. Since its inception, more than 1,000 people applied to be tested.

The Challenge was eventually terminated, with JREF noting in 2015, &quot;We can no longer justify the resources to interact with these people.&quot; No applicants managed to demonstrate their claimed abilities under the testing conditions, with all applicants either failing to demonstrate the claimed ability during the test or deviating from the foundation conditions for taking the test such that any apparent success was held invalid; thus, the prize was not awarded.

==Podcasts and videos==
The foundation produced two audio podcasts, &quot;For Good Reason&quot; which was an interview program hosted by D.J. Grothe, promoting critical thinking and skepticism about the central beliefs of society. It has not been active since December 2011. &quot;Consequence&quot; was a biweekly podcast hosted by former outreach coordinator Brian Thompson in which regular people shared their personal narratives about the negative impact a belief in pseudoscience, superstition, and the paranormal had had on their lives. It has not been active since May, 2013.

The JREF also produced a regular video cast and YouTube show, &quot;The Randi Show&quot;, in which former JREF outreach coordinator Brian Thompson interviewed Randi on a variety of skeptical topics, often with lighthearted or comedic commentary. It has not been active since August 2012. In November 2015, Harriet Hall produced a series of ten lectures called &quot;Science Based Medicine&quot; for the JREF. The videos deal with various complementary alternative medicine subjects including homeopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture, and more.

The JREF posted many of its educational videos from The Amaz!ng Meeting and other events online. There are lectures by Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Carol Tavris, Lawrence Krauss, live tests of the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, workshops on cold reading by Ray Hyman, and panels featuring leading thinking on various topics related to JREF&#x27;s educational mission on the JREF YouTube channel. JREF past president D.J. Grothe has claimed that the JREF&#x27;s YouTube channel was once the &quot;10th most subscribed nonprofit channel of all time&quot;, though its status in 2013 was 39th and most non-profits do not register for this status.

The foundation produced its own &quot;Internet Audio Show&quot; which ran January–December 2002 and was broadcast via a live stream. The archive can be found as mp3 files on the JREF website and as a podcast on iTunes.

==Forum and online community==
As part of the JREF&#x27;s goal of educating the general population about science and reason, people involved in their community ran a popular skeptic based online forum with the overall goal of promoting &quot;critical thinking and providing the public with the tools needed to reliably examine paranormal, supernatural, and pseudoscientific claims&quot;.

On October 5, 2014, this online forum was divorced from the JREF and moved as its own entity to International Skeptics Forum.

The JREF has also helped to support local grassroot efforts and outreach endeavors, such as SkeptiCamp, Camp Inquiry, and various community-organized conferences. However, according to their tax filing, they spend less than $2,000 a year on other organizations or individuals.

==JREF Award==

The JREF Award &quot;is given to the person or organization that best represents the spirit of the foundation by encouraging critical questions and seeking unbiased, fact-based answers.&quot; Some of the recipients include the following:
* 2017: Susan Gerbic
* 2018: Jen Gunter
* 2020: Sarah McAnulty
* 2022: Kathleen Dyer and Raymond Hall
* 2023: Janyce Boynton
* 2024: Office for Science and Society

<doc id="57731" wikidata="Q12967" url="?curid=57731" title="Leopold II of Belgium">
<text>Leopold II (9 April 1835 – 17 December 1909) was the second King of the Belgians from 1865 to 1909, and the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908.

Born in Brussels as the second but eldest-surviving son of King Leopold I and Queen Louise, Leopold succeeded his father to the Belgian throne in 1865 and reigned for 44 years until his death, the longest reign of a Belgian monarch to date. He died without surviving legitimate sons; the current King of the Belgians, Philippe, descends from his nephew and successor, Albert I. He is popularly referred to as the Builder King (, ) in Belgium in reference to the great number of buildings, urban projects and public works he commissioned.

Leopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State, a private colonial project undertaken on his own behalf as a personal union with Belgium. He used Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo, the present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885, the colonial nations of Europe authorised his claim and committed the Congo Free State to him. Leopold ran the Congo, which he never personally visited, by using the mercenary Force Publique for his personal gain. He extracted a fortune from the territory, initially by the collection of ivory and, after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s, by forced labour from the native population to harvest and process rubber.

Leopold&#x27;s administration was characterized by systematic brutality and atrocities in the Congo Free State, including forced labour, torture, murder, kidnapping, and the amputation of the hands of men, women, and children when the quota of rubber was not met. In one of the first uses of the term, George Washington Williams described the practices of Leopold&#x27;s administration of the Congo Free State as &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; in 1890.

While it has proven difficult to accurately estimate the pre-colonial population and the amount by which it changed under the Congo Free State, estimates for the Congolese population decline during Leopold&#x27;s rule range from 1 million to 15 million. The causes of the decline included epidemic disease, a reduced birth rate, and violence and famine caused by the regime.

==Early life==
Leopold was born in Brussels on 9 April 1835, the second child of the reigning Belgian monarch, Leopold I, and of his second wife, Louise, the daughter of King Louis Philippe of France. His eldest brother, Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium, died in infancy in 1834. As heir apparent, Leopold was granted the title of Duke of Brabant in 1840. The French Revolution of 1848 forced his maternal grandfather, Louis Philippe, to flee to the United Kingdom. Louis Philippe died two years later, in 1850. Leopold&#x27;s fragile mother was deeply affected by the death of her father and her health deteriorated. She died of tuberculosis that same year, when Leopold was 15 years old.
Leopold&#x27;s sister Charlotte became Empress Carlota of Mexico in the 1860s. The British monarch at the time, Queen Victoria, was Leopold II&#x27;s first cousin, as was Victoria&#x27;s husband, Prince Albert, since Leopold&#x27;s father, Albert&#x27;s father, Duke Ernest I of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and Victoria&#x27;s mother, the then Duchess of Kent, were all siblings. As a young man, Leopold II served in the Belgian military and achieved the rank of lieutenant-general. He also served in the Belgian Senate during this time.

==Marriage and family==
At the age of 18, Leopold married Marie Henriette of Austria, a cousin of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and granddaughter of the late Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, on 22 August 1853 in Brussels. Lively and energetic, Marie Henriette endeared herself to the people by her character and benevolence. Her beauty earned her the sobriquet &quot;The Rose of Brabant&quot;. She was also an accomplished artist and musician. She was passionate about horseback riding, to the point that she would care for her horses personally. Some joked about this &quot;marriage of a stableman and a nun&quot;, the latter referring to the shy and withdrawn Leopold. The marriage produced four children: three daughters and one son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant. The younger Leopold died in 1869 at the age of nine from pneumonia after falling into a pond. His death was a source of great sorrow for King Leopold. The marriage became unhappy, and the couple separated after a last attempt to have another son, a union that resulted in the birth of their last daughter, Clementine. Marie Henriette retreated to Spa in 1895, and died there in 1902.

Leopold had many mistresses. In 1899, in his 65th year, Leopold took as a mistress Caroline Lacroix, a 16-year-old French prostitute, and they remained together until his death ten years later. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness de Vaughan. Owing to these gifts and the unofficial nature of their relationship, their affair ironically lost Leopold more popularity in Belgium than any of his crimes in the Congo. Caroline bore two sons, Lucien Philippe Marie Antoine, Duke of Tervuren, and Philippe Henri Marie François, Count of Ravenstein. Their second son was born with a deformed hand, leading a cartoon to depict Leopold holding the child surrounded by Congolese corpses with their hands sliced off: the caption said &quot;Vengeance from on high&quot;. They married secretly in a religious ceremony five days before his death. Their failure to perform a civil ceremony rendered the marriage invalid under Belgian law. After the king&#x27;s death, it soon emerged that he had left his widow a large fortune in Congo securities, only some of which the Belgian government and Leopold&#x27;s three estranged daughters were able to win back.

==Early political career==

As Leopold&#x27;s older brother, the earlier crown prince Louis Philippe, had died the year before Leopold&#x27;s birth, Leopold was heir to the throne from his birth. When he was 5 years old, Leopold received the title of Duke of Brabant, and was appointed a sub-lieutenant in the army. He served in the army until his accession in 1865, by which time he had reached the rank of lieutenant-general.

Leopold&#x27;s public career began on his attaining the age of majority in 1855, when he became a member of the Belgian Senate. He took an active interest in the senate, especially in matters concerning the development of Belgium and its trade, and began to urge Belgium&#x27;s acquisition of colonies. Leopold traveled abroad extensively from 1854 to 1865, visiting India, China, Egypt, and the countries on the Mediterranean coast of Africa. His father died on 10 December 1865, and Leopold took the oath of office on 17 December, at the age of 30. He also served in the Belgian Senate during this time.

==Domestic reign==
Leopold became king in 1865. He explained his goal for his reign in an 1888 letter addressed to his brother, Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders: &quot;the country must be strong, prosperous, therefore have colonies of her own, beautiful and calm.&quot;

Leopold&#x27;s reign was marked by a number of major political developments. The Liberals governed Belgium from 1857 to 1880, and during its final year in power legislated the Frère-Orban Law of 1879. This law created free, secular, compulsory primary schools supported by the state and withdrew all state support from Roman Catholic primary schools. The Catholic Party obtained a parliamentary majority in 1880, and four years later restored state support to Catholic schools. In 1885, various socialist and social democratic groups drew together and formed the Labour Party. Increasing social unrest and the rise of the Labour Party forced the adoption of universal male suffrage in 1893.
During Leopold&#x27;s reign other social changes were enacted into law. Among these were the right of workers to form labour unions and the abolition of the &quot;livret d&#x27;ouvrier&quot;, an employment record book. Laws against child labour were passed. Children younger than 12 were not allowed to work in factories, children younger than 16 were not allowed to work at night, and women younger than 21 years old were not allowed to work underground. Workers gained the right to be compensated for workplace accidents and were given Sundays off.

Leopold&#x27;s reluctance to use the Dutch language in public did little to solve the linguistic conflict in Belgium and made him more unpopular than his father with the Flemish Movement. However, his nephew and heir, Prince Baudouin, became something of a hero to the Flemings, and Leopold did make some speeches in Dutch shortly before and after Baudouin&#x27;s premature death in 1891.

The first revision of the Belgian Constitution came in 1893. Universal male suffrage was introduced, though the effect of this was tempered by plural voting. The eligibility requirements for the Senate were reduced, and elections would be based on a system of proportional representation, which continues to this day. Leopold pushed strongly to enable a royal referendum, whereby the king would have the power to consult the electorate directly on an issue, and use his veto according to the results of the referendum. The proposal was rejected, as it would have given the king the power to override the elected government. Leopold was so disappointed that he considered abdication.

Leopold emphasized military defence as the basis of neutrality, and strove to make Belgium less vulnerable militarily. He achieved the construction of defensive fortresses at Liège, at Namur and at Antwerp. During the Franco-Prussian War, he managed to preserve Belgium&#x27;s neutrality in a period of unusual difficulty and danger. Leopold pushed for a reform in military service, but he was unable to obtain one until he was on his deathbed. The Belgian army was a combination of volunteers and a lottery, and it was possible for men to pay for substitutes for service. This was replaced by a system in which one son in every family would have to serve in the military. According to historian Jean Stengers, Leopold II’s imperialism was driven by economic advantage rather than political grandeur. Leopold sought to maximize profit through efficient exploitation, including forced labor and direct revenue. However, Stengers emphasizes that Leopold’s voracity was not solely for personal enrichment; it was also rooted in patriotism—a desire to ensure Belgium’s prosperity and embellishment.

===Builder King===
Leopold commissioned a great number of buildings, urban projects and public works. According to the historians Wm. Roger Louis and Adam Hochschild, this was largely possible thanks to the profits generated from the Congo Free State, though this is disputed. These projects earned him the epithet of &quot;Builder King&quot; (, ). The public buildings were mainly in Brussels, Ostend, Tervuren and Antwerp, and include the Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark (1852–1880), memorial arcade and complex, the Basilica of the Sacred Heart (1905–1969) and Duden Park in Brussels (1881); the Hippodrome Wellington racetrack (1883), the Royal Galleries and Maria Hendrikapark in Ostend (1902); the Royal Museum for Central Africa and its surrounding park in Tervuren (1898); and Antwerpen-Centraal railway station in Antwerp (1895–1905).
In addition to his public works, Leopold acquired and built numerous private properties for himself inside and outside Belgium. He expanded the grounds of the Royal Castle of Laeken, and built the Royal Greenhouses, as well as the Japanese Tower and the Chinese Pavilion near the palace (now the Museums of the Far East). In the Ardennes, his domains consisted of of forests and agricultural lands and the châteaux of Ardenne, Ciergnon, Fenffe, Villers-sur-Lesse and Ferage. He also built important country estates on the French Riviera, including the Villa des Cèdres and its botanical garden, and the Villa Leopolda.

Thinking of the future after his death, Leopold did not want the collection of estates, lands and heritage buildings he had privately amassed to be scattered among his daughters, each of whom was married to a foreign prince. In 1900, he created the Royal Trust, by means of which he donated most of his properties to the Belgian nation in perpetuity, and arranged for the royal family to continue using them after his death.

===Attempted assassination===
On 15 November 1902, Italian anarchist Gennaro Rubino attempted to assassinate Leopold, who was riding in a royal cortege from a ceremony at Church of St. Michael and St. Gudula in memory of his recently deceased wife, Marie Henriette. After Leopold&#x27;s carriage passed, Rubino fired three shots at the procession. The shots missed the king but almost killed his grand marshal, Count Charles John d&#x27;Oultremont. Rubino was immediately arrested and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment; he died in prison in 1918.

Belgians rejoiced that the king was safe: later in the day, in the Royal Theatre of La Monnaie before &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; was performed, the orchestra played &quot;The Brabançonne&quot;, which was sung loudly and ended with loud cheers and applause. Heads of state and the pope sent telegrams to the king congratulating him for surviving the assassination attempt. After the attack, Leopold replied to a senator: &quot;My dear senator, if fate wants me shot, too bad! (&quot;Mon cher Sénateur, si la fatalité veut que je sois atteint, tant pis&quot;!).

==Congo Free State==
Leopold was the founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State, a private project undertaken on his own behalf. He used explorer Henry Morton Stanley to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885, the colonial nations of Europe authorised his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the people.The central services of the state were located in Brussels. All officials within the Congo were Belgian, including those in administration, the army, and the courts. Belgian officers from the army played an essential role in the Congo’s governance. Even religious missions, especially Catholic ones, had a distinctly Belgian character.

Leopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of ivory, and after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s, by forced labour from the people to harvest and process rubber. He ran the Congo using the mercenary &quot;Force Publique&quot; for his personal enrichment. Failure to meet rubber collection quotas was punishable by death. Meanwhile, the Force Publique were required to provide a hand of their victim as proof when they had shot and killed someone, as it was believed that they would otherwise use the munitions (imported from Europe at considerable cost) for hunting. As a consequence, the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands.

Shortly after the Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference (1889–1890), Leopold issued a new decree mandating that Africans in a large part of the Free State could sell their harvested products (mostly ivory and rubber) only to the state. This law extended an earlier decree declaring that all &quot;unoccupied&quot; land belonged to the state. Any ivory or rubber collected from the state-owned land, the reasoning went, must belong to the state, thus creating a de facto state-controlled monopoly. Therefore, a large share of the local population could sell only to the state, which could set prices and thereby control the income the Congolese could receive for their work. For local elites, however, this system presented new opportunities, as the Free State and concession companies paid them with guns to tax their subjects in kind.

Under his regime, millions of Congolese inhabitants, including children, were mutilated, killed or died from disease and famine. In addition, the birth rate rapidly declined during this period. Estimates for the total population decline range from 1 million to 15 million, with a consensus growing around 10 million. Several historians argue against this figure due to the absence of reliable censuses, the enormous mortality of diseases such as smallpox or sleeping sickness and the fact that there were only 175 administrative agents in charge of rubber exploitation.

Reports of deaths and abuse led to a major international scandal in the early 20th century, and Leopold was forced by the Belgian government to relinquish control of the colony to the civil administration in 1908.

===Obtaining the Congo Free State===

Leopold fervently believed that overseas colonies were the key to a country&#x27;s greatness, and he worked tirelessly to acquire colonial territory for Belgium. He envisioned &quot;our little Belgium&quot; as the capital of a large overseas empire. Leopold eventually began to acquire a colony as a private citizen. The Belgian government lent him money for this venture.

During his reign, Leopold saw the empires of the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain as being in a state of decline and expressed interest in buying their territories. In 1866, Leopold instructed the Belgian ambassador in Madrid to speak to Queen Isabella II of Spain about ceding the Philippines to Belgium, but the ambassador did nothing. Leopold quickly replaced the ambassador with a more sympathetic individual to carry out his plan. In 1868, when Isabella II was deposed as queen of Spain, Leopold tried to press his original plan to acquire the Philippines. But without funds, he was unsuccessful. Leopold then devised another unsuccessful plan to establish the Philippines as an independent state, which could then be ruled by a Belgian. When both of these plans failed, Leopold shifted his aspirations of colonisation to Africa.

After numerous unsuccessful schemes to acquire colonies in Africa and Asia, in 1876 Leopold organized a private holding company disguised as an international scientific and philanthropic association, which he called the International African Society, or the International Association for the Exploration and Civilization of the Congo. In 1878, under the auspices of the holding company, he hired explorer Henry Stanley to explore and establish a colony in the Congo region. Much diplomatic maneuvering among European nations resulted in the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 regarding African affairs, at which representatives of 14 European countries and the United States recognized Leopold as sovereign of most of the area to which he and Stanley had laid claim. On 5 February 1885, the Congo Free State, an area 76 times larger than Belgium, was established under Leopold II&#x27;s personal rule and private army, the &quot;Force Publique&quot;.

==== Lado Enclave ====

In 1894, King Leopold signed a treaty with Great Britain which conceded a strip of land on the Congo Free State&#x27;s eastern border in exchange for a lifetime lease of the Lado Enclave, which provided access to the navigable Nile and extended the Free State&#x27;s sphere of influence northwards into Sudan. After rubber profits soared in 1895, Leopold ordered the organization of an expedition into the Lado Enclave, which had been overrun by Mahdist rebels since the outbreak of the Mahdist War in 1881. The expedition was composed of two columns: the first, under Belgian Baron Dhanis, consisted of a sizable force, numbering around 3,000, and was to strike north through the jungle and attack the rebels at their base at Rejaf. The second, a much smaller force of 800, was led by Louis-Napoléon Chaltin and took the main road towards Rejaf. Both expeditions set out in December 1896.

Although Leopold had initially planned for the expedition to carry on much farther than the Lado Enclave, hoping indeed to take Fashoda and then Khartoum, Dhanis&#x27; column mutinied in February 1897, resulting in the death of several Belgian officers and the loss of his entire force. Nonetheless, Chaltin continued his advance, and on 17 February 1897, his outnumbered forces defeated the rebels in the Battle of Rejaf, securing the Lado Enclave as Free State territory until Leopold&#x27;s death in 1909.

===Exploitation, atrocities, and death toll===

Leopold amassed a huge personal fortune by exploiting the natural resources of the Congo. At first, ivory was exported, but this did not yield the expected levels of revenue. When the global demand for rubber exploded, attention shifted to the labour-intensive collection of sap from rubber plants. Abandoning the promises of the Berlin Conference in the late 1890s, the Free State government restricted foreign access and extorted forced labour from the natives. Abuses, especially in the collection of rubber, included forced labour of the native population, beatings, widespread killings, and frequent mutilation when production quotas were not met. One practice used to force workers to collect rubber included taking wives and family members hostage.
Missionary John Harris of Baringa was so shocked by what he had encountered that he wrote to Leopold&#x27;s chief agent in the Congo, saying:
I have just returned from a journey inland to the village of Insongo Mboyo. The abject misery and utter abandon is positively indescribable. I was so moved, Your Excellency, by the people&#x27;s stories that I took the liberty of promising them that in future you will only kill them for crimes they commit.

Estimates of the death toll range from one million to fifteen million, since accurate records were not kept. Historians Louis and Stengers in 1968 stated that population figures at the start of Leopold&#x27;s control are only &quot;wild guesses&quot;, and that attempts by E. D. Morel and others to determine a figure for the loss of population were &quot;but figments of the imagination&quot;.

Adam Hochschild devotes a chapter of his 1998 book &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Ghost&quot; to the problem of estimating the death toll. He cites several recent lines of investigation, by anthropologist Jan Vansina and others, that examine local sources (police records, religious records, oral traditions, genealogies, personal diaries, and &quot;many others&quot;), which generally agree with the assessment of the 1919 Belgian government commission: roughly half the population were killed or died during the Free State period. Hochschild points out that since the first official census by the Belgian authorities in 1924 put the population at about 10 million, these various approaches suggest a rough estimate of a population decline by 10 million.

Smallpox epidemics and sleeping sickness also devastated the deeply traumatized population. By 1896, African trypanosomiasis had killed up to 5,000 people in the village of Lukolela on the Congo River. The mortality statistics were collected through the efforts of British consul Roger Casement, who found, for example, only 600 survivors of the disease in Lukolela in 1903. Research by Lowes and Montero found King Leopold II&#x27;s coercive labor practices for rubber extraction in the Congo Free State had long-lasting negative impacts. Ethnic groups subjected to more intensive rubber exploitation exhibited significantly lower economic development over a century later, driven by disruptions to traditional economic systems and human capital accumulation. Their work also examined how colonial co-option of local chiefs during the rubber era may have undermined leader accountability, linking to broader critiques of indirect rule strategies across Africa. The oppressive policies under Leopold&#x27;s personal rule are seen as engendering entrenched underdevelopment with enduring economic and political consequences in the region.

===Criticism of the management of Congo===
Inspired by works such as Joseph Conrad’s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (1902), originally published as a three-part series in &quot;Blackwood’s Magazine&quot; (1899) and based on Conrad&#x27;s experience as a steamer captain on the Congo 12 years earlier, international criticism of Leopold’s rule increased and mobilized. Reports of outrageous exploitation and widespread human rights abuses led the British Crown to appoint their consul Roger Casement to investigate conditions there. His extensive travels and interviews in the region resulted in the Casement Report, which detailed the extensive abuses under Leopold&#x27;s regime. A widespread war of words ensued. In Britain, former shipping clerk E. D. Morel with Casement&#x27;s support founded the Congo Reform Association, the first mass human rights movement. Supporters included American writer Mark Twain, whose stinging political satire entitled &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Soliloquy&quot; portrays the king arguing that bringing Christianity to the country outweighs a little starvation, and uses many of Leopold&#x27;s own words against him.

Writer Arthur Conan Doyle also criticised the &quot;rubber regime&quot; in his 1908 work &quot;The Crime of the Congo&quot;, written to aid the work of the Congo Reform Association. Doyle contrasted Leopold&#x27;s rule with British rule in Nigeria, arguing that decency required those who ruled primitive peoples to be concerned first with their uplift, not how much could be extracted from them. As Hochschild describes in &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, many of Leopold&#x27;s policies, in particular those of colonial monopolies and forced labour, were influenced by Dutch practice in the East Indies. Similar methods of forced labour were employed to some degree by Germany, France, and Portugal where natural rubber occurred in their own colonies.

Efforts by Leopold to dampen international criticism of human rights abuses included the sponsoring of an author, May French Sheldon, by his British consule Sir Alfred Lewis Jones on an expedition of the Congo Free State in 1891. While in the Congo, she traveled on steamboats owned by the state and its company allies, who controlled where she went and what she saw. When she returned to England, Jones placed her articles in the newspapers. She stated &quot;I have witnessed more atrocities in London streets than I have ever seen in the Congo.&quot; Thereafter, the king paid her a monthly salary to lobby members of Parliament.

===Relinquishment of the Congo===

International opposition and criticism at home from the Catholic Party, Progressive Liberals and the Labour Party caused the Belgian Parliament to compel the king to cede the Congo Free State to Belgium in 1908. The deal that led to the handover cost Belgium the considerable sum of 215.5 million Francs. This was used to discharge the debt of the Congo Free State and to pay out its bond holders as well as 45.5 million for Leopold&#x27;s pet building projects in Belgium and a personal payment of 50 million to him. The Congo Free State was transformed into a Belgian colony under parliamentary control known as the Belgian Congo. Leopold went to great lengths to conceal potential evidence of wrongdoing during his time as ruler of his private colony. The entire archive of the Congo Free State was burned and he told his aide that even though the Congo had been taken from him, &quot;they have no right to know what I did there&quot;.

When the Belgian government took over the administration in 1908, the situation in the Congo improved in certain respects. The brutal exploitation and arbitrary use of violence, in which some of the concessionary companies had excelled, were curbed. Article 3 of the new Colonial Charter of 18 October 1908 stated that: &quot;Nobody can be forced to work on behalf of and for the profit of companies or privates&quot;, but this was not enforced, and the Belgian government continued to impose forced labour on the natives, albeit by less obvious methods. The Belgian Congo gained independence in 1960 and became known as the Republic of the Congo.

==Death and legacy==

On 17 December 1909, Leopold II died at Laeken from an embolism, and the Belgian crown passed to Albert I, the son of Leopold&#x27;s brother, Philippe, Count of Flanders. His funeral cortege was booed by the crowd in expression of disapproval of his rule. Leopold&#x27;s reign of exactly 44 years remains the longest in Belgian history. He was interred in the royal vault at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken.
Attention to the Congo atrocities subsided in the years after Leopold&#x27;s death. Statues of him were erected in the 1930s at the initiative of Albert I, while the Belgian government celebrated his accomplishments in Belgium. The debate over Leopold&#x27;s legacy was reignited in 1999 with the publication of &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Ghost&quot; by American historian Adam Hochschild, which recounts Leopold&#x27;s plan to acquire the colony, the exploitation, and the large death toll. The debate then periodically resurfaced over the following 20 years.

In 2010, Louis Michel, a Belgian member of the European Parliament and former Belgian foreign minister, called Leopold II a &quot;visionary hero.&quot; According to Michel, &quot;To use the word &#x27;genocide&#x27; in relation to the Congo is absolutely unacceptable and inappropriate. ... maybe colonisation was domineering and acquiring more power, but at a certain moment, it brought civilisation.&quot; Michel&#x27;s remarks were countered by several Belgian politicians. Senator Pol Van Den Driessche replied, &quot;[A] great visionary? Absolutely not. What happened then was shameful. If we measured him against 21st century standards, it is likely that Leopold would be hauled before the International Criminal Court in The Hague.&quot;

In June 2020, a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Brussels protested the murder of George Floyd, causing Leopold II&#x27;s legacy to become once again the subject of debate. MPs agreed to set up a parliamentary commission to examine Belgium&#x27;s colonial past, a step likened to the Truth and Reconciliation Committee set up in South Africa after the apartheid regime was abolished. On 30 June, the 60th anniversary of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x27;s independence, King Philippe released a statement expressing his &quot;deepest regret&quot; for the wounds of the colonial past, and the &quot;acts of violence and cruelty committed&quot; in the Congo during colonisation but did not explicitly mention Leopold&#x27;s role in the atrocities. Some activists accused him of not making a full apology.

=== Statues ===

Leopold II remains a controversial figure in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the capital Kinshasa (known until 1966 as Leopoldville in his honor) his statue was removed after independence. Congolese culture minister Christophe Muzungu decided to reinstate the statue in 2005. He noted that the beginning of the Free State had been a time of some economic and social progress. He argued that people should recognize some positive aspects of the king as well as the negative, but hours after the six-metre (20ft) statue was erected near Kinshasa&#x27;s central station, it was officially removed.

Several statues have been erected to honour the legacy of Leopold II in Belgium. According to Professor of Colonial History Idesbald Goddeeris of the University of Leuven (2018), most of the statues date from the interwar period, the peak of colonial-patriotic propaganda. The monuments were supposed to help get rid of the scandal after international commotion about the atrocities in the Congo Free State during Leopold II&#x27;s rule, and to raise people&#x27;s enthusiasm for the colonial enterprise in Belgian Congo.

Leopold&#x27;s controversial regime in the Congo Free State has motivated proposals for these statues to be removed. During the international George Floyd protests against racism (May–July 2020), several statues of Leopold II were vandalised, and petitions calling for the removal of some or all statues were signed by tens of thousands of Belgians. Other petitions, signed by hundreds, called for the statues to remain.

In early June 2020, a majority in the Brussels Parliament requested a committee to be set up to &#x27;decolonise the public sphere&#x27; in the Brussels-Capital Region. From 9 June 2020 onwards, authorities in Belgium began removing some of the statues of Leopold, beginning with ones in Ekeren in the municipality of Antwerp and in the Warocqué Faculty of Economics and Management of the University of Mons on that day.

==Family==
Leopold&#x27;s sister became the Empress Carlota of Mexico. His first cousins included both Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her husband Prince Albert, as well as King Fernando II of Portugal.

He had four children with Queen Marie Henriette, of whom the youngest two have descendants living :
* Princess Louise of Belgium, born in Brussels on 18 February 1858, and died at Wiesbaden on 1 March 1924. She married Prince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on 4 February 1875, they had two children and divorced on 15 January 1906.
* Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant, Count of Hainaut (as eldest son of the heir apparent), later Duke of Brabant (as heir apparent), born at Laeken on 12 June 1859, and died at Laeken on 22 January 1869, from pneumonia, after falling into a pond.
* Princess Stéphanie of Belgium, born at Laeken on 21 May 1864, and died at the Archabbey of Pannonhalma in Győr-Moson-Sopron, Hungary, on 23 August 1945. She married (1) Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria, the heir apparent to the throne of Austria-Hungary. In 1889, he died in a suicide pact with his mistress, Baroness Mary Vetsera, at the Mayerling hunting lodge. Stéphanie&#x27;s second husband was (2) Elemér Edmund Graf Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya et Vásáros-Namény (created, in 1917, Prince Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya et Vásáros-Namény).
* Princess Clémentine of Belgium, born at Laeken on 30 July 1872, and died at Nice on 8 March 1955. She married Prince Napoléon Victor Jérôme Frédéric Bonaparte (1862–1926), head of the Bonaparte family. The current head of the Imperial family, Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon is a direct descendant of King Leopold II.

Leopold also fathered two sons by Caroline Lacroix. They were adopted in 1910 by Lacroix&#x27;s second husband, Antoine Durrieux. Leopold granted them courtesy titles that were honorary, as the parliament would not have supported any official act or decree:
* Lucien Philippe Marie Antoine (9 February 1906 – 15 November 1984) Duke of Tervuren; he married Lucie Gracieuse Mundutey (30 October 1900 – 8 February 2005) on 1 March 1927.
* Philippe Henri Marie François (16 October 1907 – 21 August 1914) Count of Ravenstein

<text>Franz Miklosich (, also known in Slovene as ; 20 November 1813 – 7 March 1891) was a Slovenian philologist and rector of the University of Vienna.

==Early life==
Miklosich was born in the small village of Radomerščak near the Lower Styrian town of Ljutomer, then part of the Austrian Empire, and baptized &quot;Franz Xav. Mikloschitsh&quot;. He graduated from the University of Graz with a doctor of philosophy degree.

==Career==
He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Graz. In 1838, he went to the University of Vienna, where he received a doctor of law decree. During his studies, he became influenced by the works of the Slovenian philologist and linguist Jernej Kopitar. He abandoned law, devoting most of his later life to the study of Slavic languages.

In 1844, he obtained a post at the Imperial Library of Vienna, where he remained until 1862. In 1844, he published a review of Franz Bopp&#x27;s book &quot;Comparative Grammar,&quot; which attracted attention from the Viennese academic circles. This publication then launched a long series of works, in which Miklosich showed immense erudition. His works led to a revolutionary change in the study of Slavic languages.

In 1849 Miklosich was appointed to the newly created chair of Slavic philology at the University of Vienna, and he occupied it until 1886. He became a member of the Academy of Vienna, which appointed him secretary of its historical and philosophical section, a member of the council of public instruction and of the upper house, and correspondent of the French Academy of Inscriptions and Humanities. His numerous writings deal not only with the Slavic languages, but also with Romanian, Aromanian, Albanian, Greek, and Romani.

Between 1850 and 1865 he was the Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy for three terms, and the Rector in 1853/1854.

From 1872 to 1880, Miklosich published his original survey of Romani dialects, &quot;Über die Mundarten und Wanderungen der Zigeuner Europas&quot;. This work included a discussion of their origins, migration routes, an historical-comparative grammar, and a lexicon. He identified a substantial Greek element that was shared by the Romani dialects, and thus named a &quot;Greek-speaking area&quot; as the &quot;European homeland of the Gypsies&quot;.

In 1883, on the occasion of his 70th birthday, he received a medal commissioned by the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

==Political engagement==
In the Spring of Nations of 1848, Miklosich, who was 35 at the time, actively engaged in the Slovene national movement. He was the chairman of the political association, called &quot;Slovenija&quot; (Slovenia) organized by Slovene students that studied in Graz and Vienna. Together with Matija Majar and Lovro Toman, he was among the authors who elaborated the political demand for a United Slovenia. After the failure of the revolutionary requests, he again turned to exclusively academic activity.

<text>Slavko Avsenik (November 26, 1929 – July 2, 2015) was a Slovene composer and musician. Beginning in 1953 with the formation of the Avsenik Brothers Ensemble, Avsenik produced more than 1,000 songs and garnered success both in Slovenia and in other parts of Europe and America, and is viewed as a Slovenian cultural icon.

==Biography and career==
Slavko Avsenik was born on November 26, 1929 in the village of Begunje na Gorenjskem, municipality of Radovljica, in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. Avsenik was a self-taught musician, who entered the music business &quot;by coincidence&quot; in 1952. In 1953 he established the Avsenik Brothers Ensemble with his brother Vilko Avensik (also spelt Ovsenik), who was a university-trained clarinet player.

His ensemble, known as &#x27;Ansambel bratov Avsenik&#x27; in Slovenian and &#x27;Slavko Avsenik und seine Original Oberkrainer&#x27; in German, was already quite popular in Slovenia by 1954, but it was their 1954 hit &quot;Na Golici&quot; which brought them international fame and renown. When the original recording was played during &#x27;Slovene Hour&#x27; on Klagenfurt Radio in the Austrian state of Carinthia (which has a sizeable Slovenian minority), Bavarian radio producer Fred Rauch immediately recognized the potential and signed the band to his label. They recorded a new version in 1955 in German, which became a huge hit first in the German-speaking world and then after, all around Europe. Growing in popularity, they soon began appearing in broadcasts, movies, and concerts, first in West Germany and then all over Europe.

In 1960, the band landed a recording contract with Telefunken-Decca. It appeared regularly on network television, toured continuously, logging over 400,000 miles in 1967 alone. Milestones include a 1961 performance before over 80,000 in Berlin Stadium, tours of the United States and Canada in 1970 and 1985, and a one-hour German television network special in 1980.

The group has won numerous awards including eight television competitions, twelve from German network television, eighteen as Germany&#x27;s most popular band, the recording industry&#x27;s &quot;European Oscar&quot; in 1975, the Golden Rose Award for the most requested group on Austrian radio in 1979, and the Hermann Löns award from the German Minister of Culture.

Avsenik&#x27;s influence over Cleveland-style polka music began in 1958 when Johnny Pecon&#x27;s English lyrics transformed Slavko&#x27;s &quot;Tam kjer murke cveto&quot; into a Cleveland-style Hit, &quot;Little Fella&quot;. Since then, Cleveland-style orchestras have recorded well over 200 Avsenik songs, including nearly sixty by the Hank Haller Ensemble, and as many more by Fred Ziwich, Fred Kuhar, the Fairport Ensemble, Al Markic, Roger Bright, Al Tercek, and Cilka Dolgan. Avsenik tribute bands in North America include Duke Marsic and his Happy Slovenians, the Alpine Sextet, Ansambel Veseli Godci and Veseli Farani, Marjan Kramer, and Planinski Kvintet. Many Slovenian polka/oberkrainer-style bands in Europe have also been influenced by Avsenik&#x27;s music, including Slovenia&#x27;s Hišni ansambel Avsenik and Gašperji/Die Jungen Oberkrainer.

The most popular song of Avsenik&#x27;s band is a polka titled &quot;Na Golici&quot; in Slovene, &quot;Trompetenecho&quot; in German, and &quot;Trumpet Echoes&quot; in English, which is considered by some to be the most played instrumental song in the world.

Over forty years, the Avsenik Ensemble&#x27;s original &quot;Oberkrainer&quot; sound became an example of ethnic musical expression for Slovenia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, northern Italy and the Benelux countries, spawning hundreds of Alpine orchestras in the process.

== Death and Legacy ==
Slavko Avsenik died on July 2, 2015, at the age of 85. Since 2008, the Avsenik Festival has been held in his home town of Begunje in his honor, featuring over 30 ensembles including the Sašo Avsenik Ensemble featuring his grandson Sašo Avsenik and his son Gregor Avsenik. One of his other sons, Slavko Avsenik Jr., is one of Slovenia&#x27;s most prominent film composers.

A monument was built by architect Klemen Rodman in 2013 to mark Avsenik&#x27;s 84th birthday, near his home town in the municipality of Radovljica. It features three accordions surrounding a traditional Upper Carniolan umbrella.

<text>Ad Lib, Inc. was a Canadian manufacturer of sound cards and other computer equipment founded by Martin Prevel, a former professor of music and vice-dean of the music department at the Université Laval. The company&#x27;s best known product, the &quot;AdLib Music Synthesizer Card&quot; (&quot;ALMSC&quot;), or simply the AdLib as it was called, was the first add-on sound card for IBM compatibles to achieve widespread acceptance, becoming the first de facto standard for audio reproduction.

==History==
After development work on the AdLib Music Synthesizer Card had concluded, the company struggled to engage the software development community with their new product. As a result, Ad Lib partnered with Top Star Computer Services, Inc., a New Jersey company that provided quality assurance services to game developers. Top Star&#x27;s President, Rich Heimlich, was sufficiently impressed by a product demonstration in Quebec in 1987 to endorse the product to his top customers. Sierra On-Line&#x27;s &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IV&quot; became the first game to support AdLib. The game&#x27;s subsequent success helped to launch the AdLib card into mainstream media coverage. As sales of the card rose, many developers began including support for the AdLib in their programs.

The success of the AdLib Music Card soon attracted competition. Not long after its introduction, Creative Labs introduced its competing Sound Blaster card. The Sound Blaster was fully compatible with AdLib&#x27;s hardware, and it also implemented two key features absent from the AdLib: a PCM audio channel and a game port. With additional features and better marketing, the Sound Blaster quickly overshadowed AdLib as the de facto standard in PC gaming audio. AdLib&#x27;s slow response, the AdLib Gold, did not sell well enough to sustain the company.

In 1992, Ad Lib filed for bankruptcy, while the Sound Blaster family continued to dominate the PC game industry. That same year, Binnenalster GmbH from Germany acquired the assets of the company. Ad Lib was renamed AdLib Multimedia and relaunched the AdLib Gold sound card and many other products. Binnenalster sold AdLib Multimedia to Softworld Taiwan in 1994.

==Products==
===AdLib Music Synthesizer Card (1987)===
AdLib used Yamaha&#x27;s YM3812 sound chip, which produces sound by FM synthesis. The AdLib card consisted of a YM3812 chip with off-the-shelf external glue logic to plug into a standard PC-compatible ISA 8-bit slot.

PC software-generated multitimbral music and sound effects through the AdLib card, although the acoustic quality was distinctly synthesized. Digital audio (PCM) was not supported; this would become a key missing feature when the competitor Creative Labs implemented it in their Sound Blaster cards. It was still possible, however, to output PCM sound with software by modulating the playback volume at an audio rate, as was done, for example, in the MicroProse game &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle II&quot; and the multi-channel music editor Sound Club for MS-DOS.

There are two separate revisions of the original AdLib sound card. The original design from 1987 provided mono output to a ¼-inch jack aimed for composers and musicians, while the second design from 1990 used a 3.5 mm miniature mono output, which was quickly becoming the new standard in the computer and game industry.

AdLib also released a version of the AdLib sound card for IBM&#x27;s MicroChannel architecture, the AdLib MCA, which used an MCA P82C611 interface IC. Notable updates for this MCA version was the use of a volume wheel, as the original potentiometer made the card too thick for the MCA standard.

===AdLib Gold 1000 (1992)===

Ad Lib planned a new proprietary standard before releasing the 12-bit stereo sound card called the AdLib Gold. The Gold 1000 used a later-generation Yamaha YMF262 (OPL3) and 12-bit digital PCM capability while retaining backward compatibility with OPL2 through the OPL3 chip. The onboard Yamaha YMZ263-F also performs 2× oversampling, which would affect the OPL3 output slightly. A surround-sound module was developed as an optional attachment that allowed a chorus surround effect to be enabled for OPL3 outputs; however, few programs supported it. One unique aspect is that it could be initialized for certain sounds and did not affect the entire output by default. Other optional attachments such as SCSI support and modem support were in development as well.

There is evidence of anti-competitive behavior by Creative in the failure of this card. Yamaha made parts for both Creative and AdLib, with Creative being Yamaha&#x27;s biggest customer at the time. The chip that Yamaha created for the AdLib card continually failed to pass testing, while Creative&#x27;s Yamaha chip passed. This enabled Creative to come to market first, shortly after which AdLib&#x27;s chip passed testing, but it was too late for it to sustain itself.

Despite AdLib&#x27;s efforts, the Gold 1000 failed to capture the market, and the company eventually went bankrupt due to cheaper alternatives such as the Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16. AdLib designed the Gold 1000 mainly in-house, as such, the Gold 1000&#x27;s layout has a lot of discrete circuitry and many surface-mount components in a grid array. Creative Labs was able to integrate their sound cards more tightly to reduce cost.

AdLib had planned a secondary release of the Gold 1000, the Gold MC2000, which would have supported the MicroChannel bus. However, AdLib went bankrupt before the card could be produced.

<doc id="57744" wikidata="Q1008" url="?curid=57744" title="Ivory Coast">
<text>Ivory Coast, also known as Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and officially the Republic of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, is a country on the southern coast of West Africa. Its capital city of Yamoussoukro is located in the centre of the country, while its largest city and economic centre is the port city of Abidjan. It borders Guinea to the northwest, Liberia to the west, Mali to the northwest, Burkina Faso to the northeast, Ghana to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s Gulf of Guinea to the south. With 31.5 million inhabitants in 2024, Ivory Coast is the third-most populous country in West Africa. Its official language is French, and indigenous languages are also widely used, including Bété, Baoulé, Dyula, Dan, Anyin, and Cebaara Senufo. In total, there are around 78 languages spoken in Ivory Coast. The country has a religiously diverse population, including numerous followers of Islam, Christianity, and traditional faiths often entailing animism.

Before its colonisation, Ivory Coast was home to several states, including Gyaaman, the Kong Empire, and Baoulé. The area became a protectorate of France in 1843 and was consolidated as a French colony in 1893 amid the Scramble for Africa. It achieved independence in 1960, led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who ruled the country until 1993. Relatively stable by regional standards, Ivory Coast established close political-economic ties with its West African neighbours while maintaining close relations with the West, especially France. Its stability was diminished by a coup d&#x27;état in 1999 and two civil wars—first between 2002 and 2007 and again during 2010–2011. It adopted a new constitution in 2016.

Ivory Coast is a republic with strong executive power vested in its president. Through the production of coffee and cocoa, it was an economic powerhouse in West Africa during the 1960s and 1970s, then experienced an economic crisis in the 1980s, contributing to a period of political and social turmoil that extended until 2011. Ivory Coast has again experienced high economic growth since the return of peace and political stability in 2011. From 2012 to 2023, the economy grew by an average of 7.1% per year in real terms, the second-fastest rate of economic growth in Africa and fourth-fastest rate in the world. In 2023, Ivory Coast had the second-highest GDP per capita in West Africa, behind Cape Verde. Despite this, as of the most recent survey in 2016, 46.1% of the population continues to be affected by multidimensional poverty. In 2020, Ivory Coast was the world&#x27;s largest exporter of cocoa beans and had high levels of income for its region. The economy still relies heavily on agriculture, with smallholder cash-crop production predominating.

==Etymology==
Originally, Portuguese merchant-explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries divided the west coast of Africa, very roughly, into four &quot;coasts&quot; reflecting resources available from each coast. The coast which they named the &quot;Costa do Marfim&quot;—meaning &quot;Coast of Ivory&quot;, and translated into French as &quot;Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;—lay between what was known as the &quot;Guiné de Cabo Verde&quot;, so-called &quot;Upper Guinea&quot; at Cap-Vert, and Lower Guinea. There was also a Pepper Coast, also known as the &quot;Grain Coast&quot; (present-day Liberia), a &quot;Gold Coast&quot; (Ghana), and a &quot;Slave Coast&quot; (Togo, Benin and Nigeria). Like those, the name &quot;Ivory Coast&quot; reflected the major trade that occurred on that particular stretch of the coast: the export of ivory.

Other names for the area included the &quot;Côte de Dents&quot;, literally &quot;Coast of Teeth&quot;, again reflecting the ivory trade; the &quot;Côte de Quaqua&quot;, after the people whom the Dutch named the Quaqua (alternatively Kwa Kwa); the Coast of the Five and Six Stripes, after a type of cotton fabric also traded there; and the &quot;Côte du Vent&quot;, the Windward Coast, after perennial local off-shore weather conditions. In the 19th century, usage switched to &quot;Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;.

The coastline of the modern state is not quite coterminous with what the 15th- and 16th-century merchants knew as the &quot;Teeth&quot; or &quot;Ivory&quot; coast, which was considered to stretch from Cape Palmas to Cape Three Points and which is thus now divided between the modern states of Ghana and Ivory Coast (with a minute portion of Liberia). It retained the name through French rule and independence in 1960. The name had long since been translated literally into other languages, which the post-independence government considered increasingly troublesome whenever its international dealings extended beyond the Francophone sphere. Therefore, in April 1986, the government declared that Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (or, more fully, République de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) would be its formal name for the purposes of diplomatic protocol and has since officially refused to recognize any translations from French to other languages in its international dealings. Despite the Ivorian government&#x27;s request, the English translation &quot;Ivory Coast&quot; (often &quot;&quot;the&quot; Ivory Coast&quot;) is still frequently used in English by various media outlets and publications.

==History==
===Land migration===
The first human presence in Ivory Coast has been difficult to determine because human remains have not been well preserved in the country&#x27;s humid climate. However, newly found weapon and tool fragments (specifically, polished axes cut through shale and remnants of cooking and fishing) have been interpreted as a possible indication of a large human presence during the Upper Paleolithic period (15,000 to 10,000 BC), or at the minimum, the Neolithic period.

The earliest known inhabitants of Ivory Coast have left traces scattered throughout the territory. Historians believe that they were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestors of the present indigenous inhabitants, who migrated south into the area before the 16th century. Such groups included the Ehotilé (Aboisso), Kotrowou (Fresco), Zéhiri (Grand-Lahou), Ega and Diès (Divo).

===Pre-Islamic and Islamic periods===
The first recorded history appears in the chronicles of North African (Berber) traders, who, from early Roman times, conducted a caravan trade across the Sahara in salt, slaves, gold, and other goods. The southern termini of the trans-Saharan trade routes were located on the edge of the desert, and from there supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of the rainforest. The most important terminals—Djenné, Gao, and Timbuctu—grew into major commercial centres around which the great Sudanic empires developed.

By controlling the trade routes with their powerful military forces, these empires were able to dominate neighbouring states. The Sudanic empires also became centres of Islamic education. Islam had been introduced in the western Sudan by Muslim Berbers; it spread rapidly after the conversion of many important rulers. From the 11th century, by which time the rulers of the Sudanic empires had embraced Islam, it spread south into the northern areas of contemporary Ivory Coast.

The Ghana Empire, the earliest of the Sudanic empires, flourished in the region encompassing present-day southeast Mauritania and southern Mali between the 4th and 13th centuries. At the peak of its power in the 11th century, its realms extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Timbuktu. After the decline of Ghana, the Mali Empire grew into a powerful Muslim state, which reached its apogee in the early part of the 14th century. The territory of the Mali Empire in Ivory Coast was limited to the northwest corner around Odienné.

Its slow decline starting at the end of the 14th century followed internal discord and revolts by vassal states, one of which, Songhai, flourished as an empire between the 14th and 16th centuries. Songhai was also weakened by internal discord, which led to factional warfare. This discord spurred most of the migrations southward toward the forest belt. The dense rainforest covering the southern half of the country created barriers to the large-scale political organisations that had arisen in the north. Inhabitants lived in villages or clusters of villages; their contacts with the outside world were filtered through long-distance traders. Villagers subsisted on agriculture and hunting.

===Pre-European modern period===

Five important states flourished in Ivory Coast during the pre-European early modern period. The Muslim Kong Empire was established by the Dyula in the early 18th century in the north-central region inhabited by the Sénoufo, who had fled Islamisation under the Mali Empire. Although Kong became a prosperous centre of agriculture, trade, and crafts, ethnic diversity and religious discord gradually weakened the kingdom. In 1895 the city of Kong was sacked and conquered by Samori Ture of the Wassoulou Empire.

The Abron kingdom of Gyaaman was established in the 17th century by an Akan group, the Abron, who had fled the developing Ashanti confederation of Asanteman in what is present-day Ghana. From their settlement south of Bondoukou, the Abron gradually extended their hegemony over the Dyula people in Bondoukou, who were recent arrivals from the market city of Begho. Bondoukou developed into a major centre of commerce and Islam. The kingdom&#x27;s Quranic scholars attracted students from all parts of West Africa. In the mid-17th century in east-central Ivory Coast, other Akan groups fleeing the Asante established a Baoulé kingdom at Sakasso and two Agni kingdoms, Indénié and Sanwi.

The Baoulé, like the Ashanti, developed a highly centralised political and administrative structure under three successive rulers. It finally split into smaller chiefdoms. Despite the breakup of their kingdom, the Baoulé strongly resisted French subjugation. The descendants of the rulers of the Agni kingdoms tried to retain their separate identity long after Ivory Coast&#x27;s independence; as late as 1969, the Sanwi attempted to break away from Ivory Coast and form an independent kingdom.

===Establishment of French rule===
Compared to neighbouring Ghana, Ivory Coast, though practising slavery and slave raiding, suffered little from the slave trade. European slave and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast. The earliest recorded European voyage to West Africa was made by the Portuguese in 1482. The first West African French settlement, Saint-Louis, was founded in the mid-17th century in Senegal, while at about the same time, the Dutch ceded to the French a settlement at Gorée Island, off Dakar. A French mission was established in 1687 at Assinie near the border with the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The Europeans suppressed the local practice of slavery at this time and forbade the trade to their merchants.

Assinie&#x27;s survival was precarious, however; the French were not firmly established in Ivory Coast until the mid-19th century. In 1843–44, French Admiral Louis Édouard Bouët-Willaumez signed treaties with the kings of the Grand-Bassam and Assinie regions, making their territories a French protectorate. French explorers, missionaries, trading companies, and soldiers gradually extended the area under French control inland from the lagoon region. Pacification was not accomplished until 1915.

Activity along the coast stimulated European interest in the interior, especially along the two great rivers, the Senegal and the Niger. Concerted French exploration of West Africa began in the mid-19th century but moved slowly, based more on individual initiative than on government policy. In the 1840s, the French concluded a series of treaties with local West African chiefs that enabled the French to build fortified posts along the Gulf of Guinea to serve as permanent trading centres. The first posts in Ivory Coast included one at Assinie and another at Grand-Bassam, which became the colony&#x27;s first capital. The treaties provided for French sovereignty within the posts and for trading privileges in exchange for fees or &quot;coutumes&quot; paid annually to the local chiefs for the use of the land. The arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the French, because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose. Nevertheless, the French government maintained the treaties, hoping to expand trade. France also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to stem the increasing influence of the British along the Gulf of Guinea coast.

The defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 and the subsequent annexation by Germany of the French province of Alsace–Lorraine initially caused the French government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its West African trading posts, leaving them in the care of resident merchants. The trading post at Grand-Bassam was left in the care of a shipper from Marseille, Arthur Verdier, who in 1878 was named Resident of the Establishment of Ivory Coast.

In 1886, to support its claims of effective occupation, France again assumed direct control of its West African coastal trading posts and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior. In 1887, Lieutenant Louis-Gustave Binger began a two-year journey that traversed parts of Ivory Coast&#x27;s interior. By the end of the journey, he had concluded four treaties establishing French protectorates in Ivory Coast. Also in 1887, Verdier&#x27;s agent, Marcel Treich-Laplène, negotiated five additional agreements that extended French influence from the headwaters of the Niger River Basin through Ivory Coast.

===French colonial era===

By the end of the 1880s, France had established control over the coastal regions, and in 1889 Britain recognised French sovereignty in the area. That same year, France named Treich-Laplène the titular governor of the territory. In 1893, Ivory Coast became a French colony, with its capital in Grand-Bassam, and Captain Binger was appointed governor. Agreements with Liberia in 1892 and with Britain in 1893 determined the eastern and western boundaries of the colony, but the northern boundary was not fixed until 1947 because of efforts by the French government to attach parts of Upper Volta (present-day Burkina Faso) and French Sudan (present-day Mali) to Ivory Coast for economic and administrative reasons.

France&#x27;s main goal was to stimulate the production of exports. Coffee, cocoa, and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast. Ivory Coast stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of European settlers; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, Europeans who emigrated to the colonies were largely bureaucrats. As a result, French citizens owned one-third of the cocoa, coffee, and banana plantations and adopted the local forced-labour system.
Throughout the early years of French rule, French military contingents were sent inland to establish new posts. The African population resisted French penetration and settlement, even in areas where treaties of protection had been in force. Among those offering the greatest resistance was Samori Ture, who in the 1880s and 1890s was establishing the Wassoulou Empire, which extended over large parts of present-day Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. Ture&#x27;s large, well-equipped army, which could manufacture and repair its own firearms, attracted strong support throughout the region. The French responded to Ture&#x27;s expansion and conquest with military pressure. French campaigns against Ture, which were met with fierce resistance, intensified in the mid-1890s until he was captured in 1898 and his empire dissolved.

France&#x27;s imposition of a head tax in 1900 to support the colony&#x27;s public works program provoked protests. Many Ivorians saw the tax as a violation of the protectorate treaties because they felt that France was demanding the equivalent of a &quot;coutume&quot; from the local kings, rather than the reverse. Many, especially in the interior, also considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission. In 1905, the French officially abolished slavery in most of French West Africa. From 1904 to 1958, Ivory Coast was part of the Federation of French West Africa. It was a colony and an overseas territory under the Third Republic. In World War I, France organized regiments from Ivory Coast to fight in France, and colony resources were rationed from 1917 to 1919. Until the period following World War II, governmental affairs in French West Africa were administered from Paris. France&#x27;s policy in West Africa was reflected mainly in its philosophy of &quot;association&quot;, meaning that all Africans in Ivory Coast were officially French &quot;subjects&quot; but without rights to representation in Africa or France.
French colonial policy incorporated concepts of assimilation and association. Based on the assumed superiority of French culture, in practice the assimilation policy meant the extension of the French language, institutions, laws, and customs to the colonies. The policy of association also affirmed the superiority of the French in the colonies, but it entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the coloniser and the colonised. Under this policy, the Africans in Ivory Coast were allowed to preserve their own customs insofar as they were compatible with French interests.

An indigenous elite trained in French administrative practice formed an intermediary group between French and Africans. After 1930, a small number of Westernized Ivorians were granted the right to apply for French citizenship. Most Ivorians, however, were classified as French subjects and were governed under the principle of association. As subjects of France, natives outside the civilised elite had no political rights. They were drafted for work in mines, on plantations, as porters, and on public projects as part of their tax responsibility. They were expected to serve in the military and were subject to the &quot;indigénat&quot;, a separate system of law.

During World War II, the Vichy regime remained in control until 1943, when members of General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s provisional government assumed control of all French West Africa. The Brazzaville Conference of 1944, the first Constituent Assembly of the Fourth Republic in 1946, and France&#x27;s gratitude for African loyalty during World War II, led to far-reaching governmental reforms in 1946. French citizenship was granted to all African &quot;subjects&quot;, the right to organise politically was recognised, and various forms of forced labour were abolished. Between 1944 and 1946, many national conferences and constituent assemblies took place between France&#x27;s government and provisional governments in Ivory Coast. Governmental reforms were established by late 1946, which granted French citizenship to all African &quot;subjects&quot; under the colonial control of the French.

Until 1958, governors appointed in Paris administered the colony of Ivory Coast, using a system of direct, centralised administration that left little room for Ivorian participation in policy-making. The French colonial administration also adopted divide-and-rule policies, applying ideas of assimilation only to the educated elite. The French were also interested in ensuring that the small but influential Ivorian elite was sufficiently satisfied with the &quot;status quo&quot; to refrain from developing anti-French sentiments and calls for independence. Although strongly opposed to the practices of association, educated Ivorians believed that they would achieve equality in the French colonial system through assimilation rather than through complete independence from France. After the assimilation doctrine was implemented through the postwar reforms, though, Ivorian leaders realised that even assimilation implied the superiority of the French over the Ivorians and that discrimination and inequality would end only with independence.

===Independence===

Félix Houphouët-Boigny, the son of a Baoulé chief, became Ivory Coast&#x27;s father of independence. In 1944, he formed the country&#x27;s first agricultural trade union for African cocoa farmers like himself. Angered that colonial policy favoured French plantation owners, the union members united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms. Houphouët-Boigny soon rose to prominence and was elected to the French Parliament in Paris within a year. A year later, the French abolished forced labour. Houphouët-Boigny established a strong relationship with the French government, expressing a belief that Ivory Coast would benefit from the relationship, which it did for many years. France appointed him as a minister, the first African to become a minister in a European government.

A turning point in relations with France was reached with the 1956 Overseas Reform Act (&quot;Loi Cadre&quot;), which transferred several powers from Paris to elected territorial governments in French West Africa and also removed the remaining voting inequities. On 4 December 1958, Ivory Coast became an autonomous member of the French Community, which had replaced the French Union.

By 1960, the country was easily French West Africa&#x27;s most prosperous, contributing over 40% of the region&#x27;s total exports. When Houphouët-Boigny became the first president, his government gave farmers good prices for their products to further stimulate production, which was further boosted by a significant immigration of workers from surrounding countries. Coffee production increased significantly, catapulting Ivory Coast into third place in world output, behind Brazil and Colombia. By 1979, the country was the world&#x27;s leading producer of cocoa. It also became Africa&#x27;s leading exporter of pineapples and palm oil. French technicians contributed to the &quot;Ivorian miracle&quot;. In other African nations, the people drove out the Europeans following independence, but in Ivory Coast, they poured in. The French community grew from only 30,000 before independence to 60,000 in 1980, most of them teachers, managers, and advisors. For 20 years, the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10%—the highest of Africa&#x27;s non-oil-exporting countries.

===Houphouët-Boigny administration===
Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s one-party rule was not amenable to political competition. Laurent Gbagbo, (who became the president of Ivory Coast in 2000) had to flee the country in the 1980s after he incurred the ire of Houphouët-Boigny by founding the Ivorian Popular Front. Houphouët-Boigny banked on his broad appeal to the population, who continued to elect him. He was criticised for his emphasis on developing large-scale projects.

Many felt the millions of dollars spent transforming his home village, Yamoussoukro, into the new political capital were wasted; others supported his vision to develop a centre for peace, education, and religion in the heart of the country. In the early 1980s, the world recession and a local drought sent shock waves through the Ivorian economy. The overcutting of timber and collapsing sugar prices caused the country&#x27;s external debt to increase three-fold. Crime rose dramatically in Abidjan as an influx of villagers exacerbated unemployment caused by the recession. In 1990, hundreds of civil servants went on strike, joined by students protesting institutional corruption. The unrest forced the government to support multi-party democracy. Houphouët-Boigny became increasingly feeble and died in 1993. He favoured Henri Konan Bédié as his successor.

===Bédié administration===
In October 1995, Bédié overwhelmingly won re-election against a fragmented and disorganised opposition. He tightened his hold over political life, jailing several hundred opposition supporters. In contrast, the economic outlook improved, at least superficially, with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt. Unlike Houphouët-Boigny, who was very careful to avoid any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative positions open to immigrants from neighbouring countries, Bedié emphasised the concept of &quot;Ivoirité&quot; to exclude his rival Alassane Ouattara, who had two northern Ivorian parents, from running for the future presidential election. As people originating from foreign countries are a large part of the Ivorian population, this policy excluded many people of Ivorian nationality. The relationship between various ethnic groups became strained, resulting in two civil wars in the following decades.

Similarly, Bedié excluded many potential opponents from the army. In late 1999, a group of dissatisfied officers staged a military coup, putting General Robert Guéï in power. Bedié fled into exile in France. The new leadership reduced crime and corruption, and the generals pressed for austerity and campaigned in the streets for a less wasteful society.

===First civil war===

A presidential election was held in October 2000 in which Laurent Gbagbo vied with Guéï, but it was not peaceful. The lead-up to the election was marked by military and civil unrest. Following a public uprising that resulted in around 180 deaths, Guéï was swiftly replaced by Gbagbo. Ouattara was disqualified by the country&#x27;s Supreme Court because of his alleged Burkinabé nationality. The constitution did not allow noncitizens to run for the presidency. This sparked violent protests in which his supporters, mainly from the country&#x27;s north, battled riot police in the capital, Yamoussoukro.

In the early hours of 19 September 2002, while Gbagbo was in Italy, an armed uprising occurred. Troops who were to be demobilised mutinied, launching attacks in several cities. The battle for the main gendarmerie barracks in Abidjan lasted until mid-morning, but by lunchtime the government forces had secured Abidjan. They had lost control of the north of the country, and rebel forces made their stronghold in the northern city of Bouaké. The rebels threatened to move on to Abidjan again, and France deployed troops from its base in the country to stop their advance. The French said they were protecting their citizens from danger, but their deployment also helped government forces. That the French were helping either side was not established as a fact, but each side accused the French of supporting the opposite side. Whether French actions improved or worsened the situation in the long term is disputed. What exactly happened that night is also disputed. The government claimed that former president Robert Guéï led a coup attempt, and state TV showed pictures of his dead body in the street; counter-claims stated that he and 15 others had been murdered at his home, and his body had been moved to the streets to incriminate him. Ouattara took refuge in the German embassy; his home had been burned down. President Gbagbo cut short his trip to Italy and on his return stated, in a television address, that some of the rebels were hiding in the shanty towns where foreign migrant workers lived. Gendarmes and vigilantes bulldozed and burned homes by the thousands, attacking residents. An early ceasefire with the rebels, which had the backing of much of the northern populace, proved short-lived and fighting over the prime cocoa-growing areas resumed. France sent in troops to maintain the cease-fire boundaries, and militias, including warlords and fighters from Liberia and Sierra Leone, took advantage of the crisis to seize parts of the west.

In January 2003, Gbagbo and rebel leaders signed accords creating a &quot;government of national unity&quot;. Curfews were lifted, and French troops patrolled the country&#x27;s western border. The unity government was unstable, and central problems remained with neither side achieving its goals. In March 2004, 120 people were killed at an opposition rally, and subsequent mob violence led to the evacuation of foreign nationals. A report concluded the killings were planned. Though UN peacekeepers were deployed to maintain a &quot;Zone of Confidence&quot;, relations between Gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate.

Early in November 2004, after the peace agreement had effectively collapsed because the rebels refused to disarm, Gbagbo ordered airstrikes against the rebels. During one of these airstrikes in Bouaké, on 6 November 2004, French soldiers were hit, and nine were killed; the Ivorian government said it was a mistake, but the French claimed it was deliberate. They responded by destroying most Ivorian military aircraft (two Su-25 planes and five helicopters), and violent retaliatory riots against the French broke out in Abidjan.

Gbagbo&#x27;s original term as president expired on 30 October 2005, but a peaceful election was deemed impossible, so his term in office was extended for a maximum of one year, according to a plan worked out by the African Union and endorsed by the United Nations Security Council. With the late-October deadline approaching in 2006, the election was regarded as very unlikely to be held by that point, and the opposition and the rebels rejected the possibility of another term extension for Gbagbo. The UN Security Council endorsed another one-year extension of Gbagbo&#x27;s term on 1 November 2006; however, the resolution provided for strengthening of Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny&#x27;s powers. Gbagbo said the next day that elements of the resolution deemed to be constitutional violations would not be applied.

A peace accord between the government and the rebels, or New Forces, was signed on 4 March 2007, and subsequently Guillaume Soro, leader of the New Forces, became prime minister. These events were seen by some observers as substantially strengthening Gbagbo&#x27;s position. According to UNICEF, at the end of the civil war, water and sanitation infrastructure had been greatly damaged. Communities across the country required repairs to their water supply.

===Second civil war===

The presidential elections that should have been organised in 2005 were postponed until November 2010. The preliminary results showed a loss for Gbagbo in favour of former Prime Minister Ouattara. The ruling FPI contested the results before the Constitutional Council, charging massive fraud in the northern departments controlled by the rebels of the New Forces. These charges were contradicted by United Nations observers (unlike African Union observers). The report of the results led to severe tension and violent incidents. The Constitutional Council, which consisted of Gbagbo supporters, declared the results of seven northern departments unlawful and that Gbagbo had won the elections with 51% of the vote – instead of Ouattara winning with 54%, as reported by the Electoral Commission. After the inauguration of Gbagbo, Ouattara—who was recognised as the winner by most countries and the United Nations—organised an alternative inauguration. These events raised fears of a resurgence of the civil war; thousands of refugees fled the country. The African Union sent Thabo Mbeki, former president of South Africa, to mediate the conflict. The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution recognising Ouattara as the winner of the elections, based on the position of the Economic Community of West African States, which suspended Ivory Coast from all its decision-making bodies while the African Union also suspended the country&#x27;s membership.

In 2010, a colonel of Ivory Coast armed forces, Nguessan Yao, was arrested in New York in a year-long U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation charged with procuring and illegal export of weapons and munitions: 4,000 handguns, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, and 50,000 tear-gas grenades, in violation of a UN embargo. Several other Ivory Coast officers were released because they had diplomatic passports. His accomplice, Michael Barry Shor, an international trader, was located in Virginia.
The 2010 presidential election led to the 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis and the Second Ivorian Civil War. International organisations reported numerous human-rights violations by both sides. In Duékoué, hundreds of people were killed. In nearby Bloléquin, dozens were killed. UN and French forces took military action against Gbagbo. Gbagbo was taken into custody after a raid into his residence on 11 April 2011. The country was severely damaged by the war, and it was observed that Ouattara had inherited a formidable challenge to rebuild the economy and reunite Ivorians. Gbagbo was taken to the International Criminal Court in January 2016. He was declared acquitted by the court but given a conditional release in January 2019. Belgium has been designated as a host country.

===Ouattara administration===
Ouattara has ruled the country since 2010. President Ouattara was re-elected in the 2015 presidential election. In November 2020, he won a third term in office in elections boycotted by the opposition. His opponents argued it was illegal for Ouattara to run for a third term. Ivory Coast&#x27;s Constitutional Council formally ratified President Ouattara&#x27;s re-election to a third term in November 2020.

In December 2022, Ivory Coast&#x27;s electric production company, launched a commission to establish the country&#x27;s first solar plant in Boundiali, with an installation of 37.5 MW, backed by a 10-MW lithium battery energy storage system.

On 6 October 2023, Ouattara dissolved the government and removed Prime Minister Patrick Achi from his position.

==Government and politics==
The government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The Parliament of Ivory Coast, consists of the indirectly elected Senate and the National Assembly which has 255 members, elected for five-year terms.

Since 1983, Ivory Coast&#x27;s capital has been Yamoussoukro, while Abidjan was the administrative center. Most countries maintain their embassies in Abidjan.

Although most of the fighting ended by late 2004, the country remained split in two, with the north controlled by the New Forces. A new presidential election was expected to be held in October 2005, and the rival parties agreed in March 2007 to proceed with this, but it continued to be postponed until November 2010 due to delays in its preparation.

Elections were finally held in 2010. The first round of elections was held peacefully and widely hailed as free and fair. Runoffs were held on 28 November 2010, after being delayed one week from the original date of 21 November. Laurent Gbagbo as president ran against former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara. On 2 December, the Electoral Commission declared that Ouattara had won the election by a margin of 54% to 46%. In response, the Gbagbo-aligned Constitutional Council rejected the declaration, and the government announced that country&#x27;s borders had been sealed. An Ivorian military spokesman said, &quot;The air, land, and sea border of the country are closed to all movement of people and goods.&quot;

President Alassane Ouattara has led the country since 2010 and he was re-elected to a third term in November 2020 elections boycotted by two leading opposition figures former President Henri Konan Bedie and ex-Prime Minister Pascal Affi N&#x27;Guessan. The Achi II government has ruled the country from April 2022 until 6 October 2023. It was succeeded by the government of Robert Beugré Mambé on 17 October 2023.

===Foreign relations===

In Africa, Ivorian diplomacy favours step-by-step economic and political cooperation. In 1959, Ivory Coast formed the Council of the Entente with Dahomey (Benin), Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), Niger, and Togo; in 1965, the African and Malagasy Common Organization (OCAM); in 1972, the Economic Community of West Africa (CEAO). The latter organisation changed to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in 1975. A founding member of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1963 and then of the African Union in 2000, Ivory Coast defends respect for state sovereignty and peaceful cooperation between African countries.

Worldwide, Ivorian diplomacy is committed to fair economic and trade relations, including the fair trade of agricultural products and the promotion of peaceful relations with all countries. Ivory Coast thus maintains diplomatic relations with international organisations and countries all around the world. In particular, it has signed United Nations treaties such as the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol, and the 1969 Convention Governing Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa. Ivory Coast is a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, African Union, La Francophonie, Latin Union, Economic Community of West African States, and South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone.

Ivory Coast has partnered with nations of the Sub-Saharan region to strengthen water and sanitation infrastructure. This has been done mainly with the help of organisations such as UNICEF and corporations like Nestle.

In 2015, the United Nations engineered the Sustainable Development Goals (replacing the Millennium Development Goals). They focus on health, education, poverty, hunger, climate change, water sanitation, and hygiene. A major focus was clean water and salinisation. Experts working in these fields have designed the WASH concept. WASH focuses on safe drinkable water, hygiene, and proper sanitation. The group has had a major impact on the sub-Saharan region of Africa, particularly the Ivory Coast. By 2030, they plan to have universal and equal access to safe and affordable drinking water.

On 1 January 2025 Ivory Coast announced that France will withdraw its troops from the country, an act that will reduce France&#x27;s influence in the region. On February 20, 2025, France officially handed over its sole military base in Ivory Coast to local authorities, marking a significant shift in their bilateral relations. This decision aligns with France&#x27;s broader strategy to reduce its military footprint in West Africa, following similar withdrawals from countries like Chad, Senegal, Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. The base, previously home to the 43rd Marine Infantry Battalion (43rd BIMA), has been transferred to Ivorian control and renamed Camp Thomas d&#x27;Aquin Ouattara, in honor of the nation&#x27;s first army chief. This move reflects Ivory Coast&#x27;s growing emphasis on national sovereignty and the modernization of its armed forces.

===Military===
The military is estimated to comprise 22,000 personnel (as of 2017). 

, major equipment items reported by the Ivory Coast Army included 10 T-55 tanks (marked as potentially unserviceable), five AMX-13 light tanks, 34 reconnaissance vehicles, 10 BMP-1/2 armoured infantry fighting vehicles, 41 wheeled APCs, and 36+ artillery pieces.

In 2012, the Ivory Coast Air Force consisted of one Mil Mi-24 attack helicopter and three SA330L Puma transports (marked as potentially unserviceable).

In 2017, Ivory Coast signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

==Administrative divisions==
Since 2011, Ivory Coast has been administratively organised into 12 districts plus two district-level autonomous cities. The districts are sub-divided into 31 regions; the regions are divided into 108 departments; and the departments are divided into 510 sub-prefectures. In some instances, multiple villages are organised into communes. The autonomous districts are not divided into regions, but they do contain departments, sub-prefectures, and communes. Since 2011, governors for the 12 non-autonomous districts have not been appointed. As a result, these districts have not yet begun to function as governmental entities.

The following is the list of districts, district capitals and each district&#x27;s regions:

===Largest cities===

==Geography==
Ivory Coast is a country in western sub-Saharan Africa. It borders Liberia and Guinea in the west, Mali and Burkina Faso in the north, Ghana in the east, and the Gulf of Guinea (Atlantic Ocean) in the south. The country lies between latitudes 4° and 11°N, and longitudes 2° and 9°W. Around 64.8% of the land is agricultural land; arable land amounted to 9.1%, permanent pasture 41.5%, and permanent crops 14.2%. Water pollution is one of the biggest issues that the country is currently facing.

===Biodiversity===
There are over 1,200 animal species including 223 mammals, 702 birds, 161 reptiles, 85 amphibians, and 111 species of fish, alongside 4,700 plant species. It is the most biodiverse country in West Africa, with the majority of its wildlife population living in the nation&#x27;s rugged interior. The nation has nine national parks, the largest of which is Assgny National Park which occupies an area of around 17,000 hectares or 42,000 acres.

The country contains six terrestrial ecoregions: Eastern Guinean forests, Guinean montane forests, Western Guinean lowland forests, Guinean forest–savanna mosaic, West Sudanian savanna, and Guinean mangroves. It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 3.64/10, ranking it 143rd globally out of 172 countries.

==Economy==

Ivory Coast has, for the region, a relatively high income per capita (US$1,662 in 2017) and plays a key role in transit trade for neighbouring landlocked countries. As of the most recent survey in 2016, 46.1% of the population continues to be affected by multidimensional poverty. The country is the largest economy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union, constituting 40% of the monetary union&#x27;s total GDP. Ivory Coast is the fourth-largest exporter of general goods in sub-Saharan Africa (following South Africa, Nigeria, and Angola).

The country is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of cocoa beans. In 2009, cocoa-bean farmers earned $2.53 billion for cocoa exports and were projected to produce 630,000 metric tons in 2013. Ivory Coast also has 100,000 rubber farmers who earned a total of $105 million in 2012.

Close ties to France since independence in 1960, diversification of agricultural exports, and encouragement of foreign investment have been factors in economic growth. In recent years, Ivory Coast has been subject to greater competition and falling prices in the global marketplace for its primary crops of coffee and cocoa. That, compounded with high internal corruption, makes life difficult for the grower, those exporting into foreign markets, and the labour force; instances of indentured labour have been reported in the country&#x27;s cocoa and coffee production in every edition of the U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s &quot;List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor&quot; since 2009.

Ivory Coast&#x27;s economy has grown faster than that of most other African countries since independence. One possible reason for this might be taxes on exported agriculture. Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Kenya were exceptions as their rulers were themselves large cash-crop producers, and the newly independent countries desisted from imposing penal rates of taxation on exported agriculture. As such, their economies did well.

Around 7.5 million people made up the workforce in 2009. The workforce took a hit, especially in the private sector, during the early 2000s with numerous economic crises since 1999. Furthermore, these crises caused companies to close and move locations, especially in the tourism industry, and transit and banking companies. Decreasing job markets posed a huge issue as unemployment rates grew. Unemployment rates rose to 9.4% in 2012. Solutions proposed to decrease unemployment included diversifying jobs in small trade. This division of work encouraged farmers and the agricultural sector. Self-employment policy, established by the Ivorian government, allowed for very strong growth in the field with an increase of 142% in seven years from 1995.

==Demographics==

According to the 14 December 2021 census, the population was 29,389,150, up from 22,671,331 at the 2014 census. The first national census in 1975 counted 6.7 million inhabitants. According to a Demographic and Health Surveys nationwide survey, the total fertility rate stood at 4.3 children per woman in 2021 (with 3.6 in urban areas and 5.3 in rural areas), down from 5.0 children per woman in 2012.

===Languages===

It is estimated that 78 languages are spoken in Ivory Coast. French, the official language, is taught in schools and serves as a lingua franca. A semi-creolised form of French, known as Nouchi, has emerged in Abidjan in recent years and spread among the younger generation. One of the most common indigenous languages is Dyula, which acts as a trade language in much of the country, particularly in the north, and is mutually intelligible with other Manding languages widely spoken in neighboring countries.

===Ethnic groups===

Macroethnic groupings in the country include Akan (42.1%), Voltaiques or Gur (17.6%), Northern Mandés (16.5%), Kru-speaking peoples (11%), Southern Mandés (10%), and others (2.8%, including 100,000 Lebanese and 45,000 French; 2004). Most of these categories are subdivided into different ethnicities. For example, the Akan grouping includes the Baoulé, the Voltaique category includes the Senufo, the Northern Mande category includes the Dyula and the Maninka, the Kru category includes the Bété and the Kru, and the Southern Mande category includes the Yacouba.

About 77% of the population is considered Ivorian. Since Ivory Coast has established itself as one of the most successful West African nations, about 20% of the population (about 3.4 million) consists of workers from neighbouring Liberia, Burkina Faso, and Guinea. About 4% of the population is of non-African ancestry. Many are French, Lebanese, Vietnamese and Spanish citizens, as well as evangelical missionaries from the United States and Canada. In November 2004, around 10,000 French and other foreign nationals evacuated Ivory Coast due to attacks from pro-government youth militias. Aside from French nationals, native-born descendants of French settlers who arrived during the country&#x27;s colonial period are present.

===Religion===

Ivory Coast has a religiously diverse population. According to the latest 2021 census data, adherents of Islam (mainly Sunni) represented 42.5% of the total population, while followers of Christianity (mainly Catholic and Evangelical) comprised 39.8% of the population. An additional 12.6% of the population identified as irreligious, while 2.2% reported following animism (traditional African religions), 0.7% another religion, and 2.2% did not state their religion in the census. Excluding those who did not state their religion, the population was 43.5% Muslim, 40.7% Christian, 12.9% not religious, 2.2% animist, and 0.7% adherent of another religion.

Between the 1998 and 2021 censuses, the Muslim population of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire grew by 110% (i.e. Muslim population 2.1 times larger in 2021 compared to 1998), whereas the Christian population grew by 150% (i.e. Christian population 2.5 times larger in 2021 compared to 1998), and the Animist population experienced a decline of 65.5%.

A 2020 estimate by the Pew Research Center, projected that Christians would represent 44% of the total population, while Muslims would represent 37.2% of the population. In addition, it estimated that 8.1% would be religiously unaffiliated, and 10.5% as followers of traditional African religions (animism). In 2009, according to U.S. Department of State estimates, Christians and Muslims each made up 35% to 40% of the population, while an estimated 25% of the population practised traditional (animist) religions.

Yamoussoukro is home to the largest church building in the world, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace.

===Health===
Life expectancy at birth was 42 for males in 2004; for females it was 47. Infant mortality was 118 of 1000 live births. Twelve physicians are available per 100,000 people. About a quarter of the population lives below the international poverty line of US$1.25 a day. About 36% of women have undergone female genital mutilation. According to 2010 estimates, Ivory Coast has the 27th-highest maternal mortality rate in the world. The HIV/AIDS rate was 19th-highest in the world, estimated in 2012 at 3.20% among adults aged 15–49 years.

===Education===

Among sub-Saharan African countries, Ivory Coast has one of the highest literacy rates. According to The World Factbook, in 2019, 89.9% of the population aged 15 and over could read and write. A large part of the adult population, in particular women, is illiterate. Many children between 6 and 10 years old are not enrolled in school. The majority of students in secondary education are male. At the end of secondary education, students can sit for the&quot; baccalauréat&quot; examination. Universities include Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny in Abidjan and the Université Alassane Ouattara in Bouaké.

===Science and technology===

According to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Ivory Coast devotes about 0.13% of GDP to GERD. Apart from low investment, other challenges include inadequate scientific equipment, the fragmentation of research organizations and a failure to exploit and protect research results. Ivory Coast was ranked 112th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, down from 103rd in 2019. The share of the &quot;National Development Plan&quot; for 2012–2015 that is devoted to scientific research remains modest. Within the section on greater wealth creation and social equity (63.8% of the total budget for the &quot;Plan&quot;), just 1.2% is allocated to scientific research. Twenty-four national research programmes group public and private research and training institutions around a common research theme. These programmes correspond to eight priority sectors for 2012–2015, namely: health, raw materials, agriculture, culture, environment, governance, mining and energy; and technology.

==Culture==
Each of the ethnic groups in the Ivory Coast has its own music genres, most showing strong vocal polyphony. Talking drums are common, especially among the Appolo, and polyrhythms, another African characteristic, are found throughout Ivory Coast being especially common in the southwest. Popular music genres from Ivory Coast include zoblazo, zouglou, and Coupé-Décalé. A few Ivorian artists who have known international success are Magic Système, Alpha Blondy, Meiway, Dobet Gnahoré, Tiken Jah Fakoly, DJ Arafat, AfroB, Serge Beynaud and Christina Goh, of Ivorian descent.

===Sport===

The most popular sport is association football. The men&#x27;s national football team has played in the World Cup three times, in Germany 2006, in South Africa 2010, and Brazil in 2014, and has won three times in the Africa Cup of Nations, most recently in the 2023 edition, when they were the host nation. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire has produced many well-known footballers like Didier Drogba and Yaya Touré. The women&#x27;s football team played in the 2015 Women&#x27;s World Cup in Canada. The country has been the host of several major African sporting events, with the most recent being the 2013 African Basketball Championship. In the past, the country hosted the 1984 African Cup of Nations, in which the Ivory Coast finished fifth, and the 1985 African Basketball Championship, where the national basketball team won the gold medal.

400m metre runner Gabriel Tiacoh won the silver medal in the men&#x27;s 400 metres at the 1984 Olympics. The country hosted the 8th edition of Jeux de la Francophonie in 2017. In the sport of athletics, well known participants include Marie-Josée Ta Lou and Murielle Ahouré.

Rugby union is popular, and the national rugby union team qualified to play at the Rugby World Cup in South Africa in 1995. Ivory Coast has won three African Cup of Nation titles: one in 1992, another one in 2015, and the third one in 2024. Ivory Coast is known for Taekwondo with well-known competitors such as Cheick Cissé, Ruth Gbagbi, and Firmin Zokou.

===Cuisine===

Traditional cuisine is very similar to that of neighbouring countries in West Africa in its reliance on grains and tubers. Cassava and plantains are significant parts of Ivorian cuisine. A type of corn paste called &quot;aitiu&quot; is used to prepare corn balls, and peanuts are widely used in many dishes. &quot;Attiéké&quot; is a popular side dish made with grated cassava, a vegetable-based couscous. Common street food is &quot;alloco&quot;, plantain fried in palm oil, spiced with steamed onions and chili, and eaten along with grilled fish or boiled eggs. Chicken is commonly consumed and has a unique flavor because of its lean, low-fat mass in this region. Seafood includes tuna, sardines, shrimp, and bonito, which is similar to tuna. &quot;Mafé&quot; is a common dish consisting of meat in peanut sauce.

Slow-simmered stews with various ingredients are another common food staple. &quot;Kedjenou&quot; is a dish consisting of chicken and vegetables slow-cooked in a sealed pot with little or no added liquid, which concentrates the flavors of the chicken and vegetables and tenderises the chicken. It is usually cooked in a pottery jar called a canary, over a slow fire, or cooked in an oven. &quot;Bangui&quot; is a local palm wine.

Ivorians have a particular kind of small, open-air restaurant called a &quot;maquis&quot;, which is unique to the region. A &quot;maquis&quot; normally features braised chicken, and fish covered in onions and tomatoes served with acheke or kedjenou.

<doc id="57745" wikidata="Q1385170" url="?curid=57745" title="Hayman Fire">
<text>The Hayman Fire was a forest fire started on June 8, 2002, northwest of Colorado Springs, Colorado and southwest of Denver, Colorado and was, for 18 years, the largest wildfire in the state&#x27;s recorded history at over 138,114 acres.

Hundreds of firefighters fought the fast-moving fire, which caused nearly $40 million in firefighting costs, burned 133 homes, 138,114 acres, and forced the evacuation of 5,340 people.

Smoke could be seen and smelled across the state from Vail, northwest, to Burlington, east, and from Broomfield, north, to Walsenburg, south.

The Hayman Fire burned from June 8, until it was classified as contained on June 28, 2002. The cause of the wildfire was found to be arson.

When then-Governor Bill Owens responded to a reporter&#x27;s question following an aerial tour of the fires (&quot;What does it look like up there?&quot;), Owens said &quot;It looks as if all of Colorado is burning today.&quot; Many western slope residents blamed Owens for driving away tourists with the press&#x27; truncated version of the quote (&quot;All of Colorado is burning.&quot;) The Hayman Fire was named for a mining ghost town near Tappan Gulch.

== Impact of the fire ==
The fire resulted directly in the death of one civilian, and five firefighters were killed en route to the fire. Costs included $39.1 million in suppression costs and total private property losses valued at $40.4 million, and indirectly led to the death of five firefighters. Overall, 600 structures were burned in the fire including 133 homes, 1 commercial building and 466 outbuildings. While the fire burned, record amounts of particulate matter were measured in the air.

As a result of the fire, flooding in the burn area increased. Consequently, many roads and bridges in the area were washed out. This included State Highway 67, the main highway that runs through the area. Other indirect destruction included sediment runoff into a reservoir that is used as a water source for Denver. The removal of this sediment cost $25 million.

Most of the burn area is inside of the Pike National Forest. The fire caused the closure of a large part of the national forest land as well as nearby Eleven Mile State Park and Spinney State Park. Tourism saw a sharp decline in the area and it is estimated that local businesses lost 50% of their seasonal revenues as a result of the fire-induced closures.

== Fatalities ==

Ann Dow, 50, suffered a fatal asthma attack on the evening of June 10, 2002, when heavy smoke from the fire drifted over the Dows&#x27; home south of Florissant. She quickly lapsed into unconsciousness and paramedics could not revive her. Her death certificate lists the cause as &quot;acute asthma attack due to or as a consequence of smoke inhalation.&quot;

Five firefighters died from injuries sustained from a June 21, 2002, traffic accident en route to the Hayman fire from Oregon: Zach Zigich, Retha Shirley, Jacob Martindale, Danial Rama, and Bart Bailey. They are listed in the memorial to fallen firefighters on the Wildland Firefighter Foundation&#x27;s website.

== Criminal prosecutions ==
A forestry technician with the U.S. Forest Service, Terry Barton, set the fire in a campfire ring during a total burn ban triggered by a National Weather Service red flag warning. Barton&#x27;s claim that she was attempting to burn a letter from her estranged husband was disputed by one of her teenage daughters who testified that a psychology teacher had told Ms. Barton to write her feelings in a letter and burn it. The fire quickly spread out of the campfire ring and eventually torched over and burned across four different counties. A federal grand jury indicted Barton on four felony counts of arson.

Barton pleaded guilty to two charges: setting fire to federal forest land and lying to investigators and was given a six-year sentence in federal prison. U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch refused, however, to impose the $14 million restitution asked for by prosecutors, saying he would not sentence her to a &quot;life of poverty.&quot; Additionally, the State of Colorado sentenced Barton to 12 years in prison to run concurrently with the 6-year federal sentence. The state sentence was overturned on appeal, however, on grounds that the presiding judge had &quot;the appearance of prejudice&quot; because smoke from the fire had motivated him to voluntarily leave his home for one night. In March 2008, Barton was re-sentenced by a different judge to 15 years of probation and 1,000 hours community service.

Several insurance companies filed a $7 million suit against the government in the fall of 2008, claiming that Barton was negligent in her duties. In November, Judge Wiley Daniel ruled that the government was not responsible for Barton&#x27;s actions because she was acting as an angry spouse and not as a government worker.

In August 2018, Barton&#x27;s sentence was extended another 15 years in the form of unsupervised probation (the unsupervised probation was ordered to save legal fees that would then be redirected towards restitution). Judge William Brian ordered that Barton continue to make payments toward the $14.5 million in restitution she owed as of the 2018 re-sentencing. The judge also ordered that Barton get a full-time job.

<doc id="57746" wikidata="Q439813" url="?curid=57746" title="Jacobus Gallus">
<text>Jacobus Gallus (a.k.a. Jacob(us) Handl, Jacob(us) Händl; between 15 April and 31 July 155018 July 1591) was a late-Renaissance composer of presumed Slovene ethnicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skei/Pokorn, Grove online&quot;&gt;Skei/Pokorn, Grove online&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Carniola, which at the time was one of the Habsburg lands in the Holy Roman Empire, he lived and worked in Moravia and Bohemia during the last decade of his life.

== Life ==
Gallus&#x27;s name has been Slovenianized as &quot;Jakob Petelin&quot; (&quot;petelin&quot; means &#x27;rooster&#x27;; &quot;Handl&quot; and &quot;gallus&quot; mean the same in German and Latin, respectively). However, Gallus never used the name &quot;Petelin&quot;. He was probably born in Reifnitz (now Ribnica, southern Slovenia), although Slovene folk tradition also claims his birthplace to be at Šentviška Gora in the Slovenian Littoral. He used the Latin form of his name, to which he often added the adjective &quot;Carniolus&quot;, thus giving credit to his homeland Carniola.

Gallus most likely was educated at the Cistercian Stična Abbey in Carniola. He left Carniola sometime between 1564 and 1566, traveling first to Austria, and later to Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. For some time he lived at the Benedictine Melk Abbey in Lower Austria. He was a member of the Viennese court chapel in 1574, and was choirmaster (&quot;Kapellmeister&quot;) to the bishop of Olomouc between 1579 (or 1580) and 1585. From 1585 to his death he worked in Prague as organist to the Church of St. John on the Balustrade (). Gallus died on 18 July 1591 in Prague.

== Work ==
Gallus represented the Counter-Reformation in Bohemia, mixing the polyphonic style of the High Renaissance Franco-Flemish School with the style of the Venetian School. His output was both sacred and secular, and hugely prolific: over 500 works have been attributed to him. Some are for large forces, with multiple choirs of up to 24 independent parts.

His most notable work is the four-part &quot;Opus musicum&quot; (1586–1590), a collection of 374 motets that cover the liturgical needs of the entire ecclesiastical year. The motets were printed in the Prague printing house of Georgius Nigrinus, which also published 16 of his 20 extant masses. The motet &quot;O magnum mysterium&quot; comes from the first volume (printed in 1586), which covers the period from the first Sunday of Advent to the Septuagesima. His motets show evidence of influence by the Venetian polychoral style, with their use of the &quot;coro spezzato&quot; technique.

His wide-ranging, eclectic style blended archaism and modernity. He rarely used the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; technique, preferring the then-new Venetian polychoral manner, yet he was equally conversant with earlier imitative techniques. Some of his chromatic transitions foreshadowed the breakup of modality; his five-voice motet &quot;Mirabile mysterium&quot; contains chromaticism worthy of Carlo Gesualdo. He enjoyed word painting in the style of the madrigal, yet he could write the simple &quot;Ecce quomodo moritur justus&quot; later used by George Frideric Handel in his funeral anthem &quot;The Ways of Zion Do Mourn&quot;.

His secular output, about 100 short pieces, was published in the collections &quot;Harmoniae morales&quot; (Prague 1589 and 1590) and &quot;Moralia&quot; (Nuremberg 1596). Some of these works were madrigals in Latin, an unusual language for the form (most madrigals were in Italian); others were songs in German, and others were compositions in Latin.

Critical editions of Gallus works have been prepared by Edo Škulj and published by the Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRCSAZU).

==Commemoration==

Gallus has been commemorated with the naming of the central hall in the Cankar Centre &quot;Gallus Hall&quot; (). Part of the right embankment of the river Ljubljanica in Ljubljana, stretching from St. James&#x27;s Bridge to the Cobbler&#x27;s Bridge, has the name &quot;Gallus Embankment&quot; (). This is also the name of the left embankment of the river Bistrica in the town of Ribnica, his birthplace. A monument with a bronze head of the composer, work by the architect Jože Plečnik and the sculptor Lojze Dolinar from 1932, as well as a stone plaque from 1973 also commemorate him there. The plaque was originally installed already in 1933 but destroyed during World War II. The Slovenian Public Fund of Cultural Activities annually awards the deserving musicians the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Gallus Badges () and the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Gallus Citations (). Gallus was depicted on the front side of the now-obsolete 200-tolar banknote of the Republic of Slovenia.

<doc id="57749" wikidata="Q112934" url="?curid=57749" title="Socorro County, New Mexico">
<text>Socorro County () is a county in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 16,595. The county seat is Socorro. The county was formed in 1852 as one of the original nine counties of New Mexico Territory. Socorro was originally the name given to a Native American village (&quot;see&quot;: Puebloan peoples) by Don Juan de Oñate in 1598. Having received vitally needed food and assistance from the native population, Oñate named the pueblo &quot;Socorro&quot; (&quot;succor&quot; in English).

Socorro County is home to multiple scientific research institutions including New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and its associated Very Large Array, the Magdalena Ridge Observatory, and the Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research. Federal public lands in Socorro County include parts of the Cibola National Forest, the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Socorro Field Office, parts of the Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument, and parts of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail.

==History==
Socorro County&#x27;s history is intimately linked with the rich history of the surrounding area. Basham noted in his report documenting the archeological history of the Cibola National Forest&#x27;s Magdalena Ranger District, which is almost entirely within Socorro County, that “[t]he heritage resources on the district are diverse and representative of nearly every prominent human evolutionary event known to anthropology. Evidence for human use of district lands date back 14,000 years to the Paleoindian period providing glimpses into the peopling of the New World and megafaunal extinction.“
Much of the now Magdalena Ranger District were a province of the Apache. Bands of Apache effectively controlled the Magdalena-Datil region from the seventeenth century until they were defeated in the Apache Wars in the late nineteenth century.

Outlaw renegades Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch and notorious Apaches like Cochise and Geronimo have ties to Socorro County&#x27;s San Mateo Mountains. Vicks Peak was named after Victorio, “a Mimbreño Apache leader whose territory included much of the south and southwest New Mexico.” Famous for defying relocation orders in 1879 and leading his warriors “on a two-year reign of terror before he was killed,” Victorio is at least as highly regarded as Geronimo or Cochise among Apaches. Perhaps most famous outlaw was the Apache Kid whose supposed grave lies within the Apache Kid Wilderness. Stories of depredations by the Apache Kid, and of his demise, became so common and dramatic that in southwestern folklore they may be exceeded only by tales of lost Spanish gold. Native Americans lingered in the San Mateos well into the 1900s. We know this by an essay written by Aldo Leopold in 1919 where he documents stumbling upon the remains of a recently abandoned Indian hunting camp.

A mining rush followed the Apache wars – gold, silver, and copper were found in the mountains. It wasn&#x27;t until this time that extensive use of the area by non-Native Americans occurred. While some mining activity, involving gold, silver, and copper, occurred in the southern part of the range near the end of the nineteenth century, the prospecting/mining remnants are barely visible today due to collapse, topographic screening, and vegetation regrowth. While miners combed the mountains for mineral riches during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, stockmen drove tens of thousands of sheep and cattle to stockyards at the village of Magdalena, then linked by rail with Socorro. In fact, the last regularly used cattle trail in the United States stretched 125 miles westward from Magdalena. The route was formally known as the Magdalena Livestock Driveway, but more popularly known to cowboys and cattlemen as the Beefsteak Trail. The trail began use in 1865 and its peak was in 1919. The trail was used continually until trailing gave way to trucking and the trail officially closed in 1971.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.03%) is water. It is the second-largest county in New Mexico by area, after Catron County.

Socorro County ranges in elevation from approximately on the banks of the Rio Grande to at the top of South Baldy peak in the Magdalena Mountains. The southern portion of the Rocky Mountains extend into New Mexico and Socorro County. There are several mountain ranges that spread throughout the county. The Forest Service manages portions of four mountain ranges: the Bear, Datil, Magdalena, and San Mateo Mountains. Most of the land that comprises these mountains are within the Cibola National Forest. These ranges, as well as Ladron Peak located in Socorro County, are classified as sky islands.

==Politics==
Like much of New Mexico, Socorro County has leaned toward the Democratic Party in many recent elections, though in the past it leaned Republican. The majority (51 percent) of voters registered in the 2012 General Election were Democrats, with the rest of registered voters breaking down as 30 percent Republican, 15 percent Declined To Say, and 3 percent Other. In 2012, Socorro County voted for President Obama 56 percent to 38 percent, with a trend of voting Democratic from 1992 through 2020. In 2024, Donald Trump carried the county with a narrow majority, the first time a Republican presidential candidate had done this since Bush in 1988.











Socorro County voted for Senator Heinrich (D) 53 percent to 43 percent in 2012. While Rep. Pearce (R) won Socorro County 52 percent to 48 percent in 2012, Socorro supported Democrats for the U.S. House in both 2008 and 2010 (with 50.2% and 63% Democratic, respectively). The County supported Governor Martinez (R) 53 percent to 47 percent in 2010 but went for Governor Richardson (D) in both 2002 and 2006. Socorro has supported Democratic state senators in Districts 28 and 30 for every election since 2000. In contrast, the county has supported a Republican state representative in District 49 since 2000.
The current county commissioners of Socorro County are:
* Pauline Jaramillo, R-Dist. 1, Chair
* Martha Salas, R-Dist. 2, Vice Chair
* Manuel Anaya, D-Dist. 3
* Danny Monette, R-Dist. 4,
* Juan Gutierrez, R-Dist. 5
Socorro County backed Democratic gubernatorial nominee Michelle Lujan Grisham in 2018 by 57.4%, defeating Republican Steve Pearce by nearly 15 points in the county. However, in 2022, Republicans rebounded considerably and Grisham lost Socorro county to Republican Mark Ronchetti, by a margin of just 38 votes (2,988 votes to 2,950 respectively). It was the only county in the state to flip Republican that year, even as Grisham handedly won re-election statewide.

==Ecology, recreation and tourism==

With multiple mountain ranges, extents of grasslands and marshes providing a wide array of available habitats, Socorro County is home to an extensive variety of ecosystems and wildlife. Socorro County contains 826 species of wildlife, including 14 amphibians, 60 reptiles, 336 birds, and 96 mammals. Wildlife in the County includes coyote, deer, elk, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, Barbary sheep, black bear, mountain lion, wild turkey, various furbearers, Mexican spotted owl, and quail.

There are three congressionally designated Wilderness areas located within Socorro County. The Apache Kid and the Withington Wilderness Areas are both located in the San Mateo Mountains within the Cibola National Forest&#x27;s Magdalena Ranger District. The Bosque del Apache Wilderness comprises two separate sections, totaling 30,427 acres of the National Wildlife Refuge. There are an additional 172,143 acres of Forest Service Inventoried Roadless Areas and 159,891 acres of BLM Wilderness Study Areas in the county. These undeveloped lands without roads offer outstanding opportunities to experience the area&#x27;s amazing natural heritage, to getaway and enjoy the outdoors and, for the hearty, to explore deep into the backcountry and challenge yourself in the area&#x27;s big wild.

The high mountains, remote canyons, pristine forests and diverse wildlife found on the area&#x27;s national forests, national wildlife refuges, national monuments, and BLM&#x27;s national system of public lands provide for phenomenal recreation opportunities, including picnicking, hiking, backpacking, wildlife viewing, horseback-riding, and hunting. In fact, the four biggest elk in New Mexico were bagged in Socorro county and the Datil Mountains. The two most popular recreational activities on the Cibola National Forest are hiking/walking and viewing natural features with 35% and 15% of visitors citing these as their main activities, respectively. The Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge hosts the Festival of the Cranes every November, celebrating the arrival of sandhill cranes and other migratory birds. Rare whooping cranes are also found occasionally on the Bosque del Apache.

The natural amenities in Socorro contribute to a strong tourism industry for the county. Visitors spent $47.4 million in Socorro County in 2011. Recreation alone accounted for more than $4 million in visitor spending in both 2010 and 2011. Tourism accounts for 8.8% of employment and 4.5% of labor income for the county. Additionally, tourism resulted in $7.7 million of total tax revenue, including $1.1 million in local tax revenue.

<text>Sir Ian Livingstone (born 29 December 1949) is an English fantasy author and entrepreneur. Along with Steve Jackson, he is the co-founder of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series of role-playing gamebooks, and the author of many books within that series. He co-founded Games Workshop in 1975 and helped create Eidos Interactive as executive chairman of Eidos Plc in 1995.

==Early life==

Livingstone attended Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, where, according to him, he only earned one A-level, in Geography. He has kept his close links with the school and has visited it on numerous occasions.

==Career==

===Games Workshop===
Livingstone co-founded Games Workshop in early 1975 with flatmates John Peake and Steve Jackson. They began publishing the monthly newsletter &quot;Owl and Weasel&quot;, and distributed copies of the first issue to fanzine &quot;Albion&quot; subscribers; Brian Blume received one of these copies, and sent them a copy of the new game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in return. Livingstone and Jackson found this game to be more imaginative than games produced in the UK at the time, and so worked out an arrangement with Blume for an exclusive deal to sell &quot;D&amp;D&quot; in Europe. They began distributing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and other TSR products later in 1975. Livingstone and Jackson organised a convention for their first time in late 1975, which became known as the first Games Day. Because they were selling products out of their flat, customers would come there looking for a store that did not exist; because of this their landlord evicted them in summer 1976.

Under the direction of Livingstone and Jackson, Games Workshop expanded from a bedroom mail order company to a successful gaming manufacturer and retail chain, with the first Games Workshop store opening in Hammersmith in 1977. In June of that year, partially to advertise the opening, Livingstone and Jackson launched the gaming magazine &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, with Livingstone as the editor. Livingstone chose the title, which had meaning relevant to both the fantasy and science fiction genres: a &quot;white dwarf&quot; could be a reference to both a stellar phenomenon and to a fantasy character. Livingstone ended his run as editor after &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #74 (February 1986).

In 1980, Livingstone and Jackson began to develop the concept of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebook series, the first volume of which (&quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;) was published in 1982 by Puffin Books. Livingstone and Jackson sold Games Workshop in 1991 for million. The pair, together with Bryan Ansell, founded Citadel Miniatures in Newark to make miniatures for games. Livingstone has also invented several board games, including &quot;Boom Town&quot;, &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, &quot;Automania&quot;, &quot;Legend of Zagor&quot;, and &quot;Dragonmasters&quot;.

===&quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot;===
In 1982, Jackson and Livingstone co-wrote &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;, the first book in the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series, but following an instruction from publishers Penguin to write more books &quot;as quickly as possible&quot; the pair wrote subsequent books separately. The series had sold over 18 million copies as of 2017, with Livingstone&#x27;s &quot;Deathtrap Dungeon&quot; selling over 350,000 copies in its first year alone. Livingstone wrote another twelve &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebooks, including &quot;The Forest of Doom&quot;, &quot;City of Thieves&quot; and &quot;Caverns of the Snow Witch&quot; before marking the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; with a new gamebook, &quot;Blood of the Zombies&quot;, in 2012, and with &quot;The Port of Peril&quot; in 2017 for the 35th anniversary.

===Video games===
In the mid-1980s Livingstone did design work for video game publisher Domark; he returned to the company in 1993 as a major investor and board member. Livingstone later recounted, &quot;After the success of Games Workshop, I retired, got bored, and invested in Domark to fund their cartridge development. I got in at just the wrong time - it was all going flat.&quot; In 1995, Domark was acquired by the video technology company Eidos, which had been floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1990, and formed the major part of the newly created Eidos plc, known for Eidos Interactive. Livingstone resigned as executive chairman in 2002 and became creative director. In 2005 Eidos was taken over by SCi and Livingstone was the only former board member to be retained, taking on the role of product acquisition director. Livingstone secured many of the company&#x27;s major franchises, including &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; and &quot;Hitman&quot;. He contributed to the Tomb Raider project &quot;Tomb Raider: Anniversary&quot; (an enhanced version of the original &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; game), which was released in 2007. In 2009, Japanese video-game company Square Enix completed a buyout of Eidos Interactive and Livingstone was promoted to Life President of Eidos, a position he resigned from in 2013.

In 2014 Livingstone appeared in the documentary feature film &quot;From Bedrooms to Billions&quot; (2014) a film that tells the story of the British Video Games Industry from 1979 to present. In 2021 Freeway Fighters received an adaptation on Viber and messenger, created by a Talk-a-Bot chatbot company over Viber and messenger. Livingstone was the non-executive chairman of Sumo Group from 2015 to 2022. He is a general partner at Hiro Capital, which invested in Skybound Entertainment in 2022.

===Educational===
In 2010 Livingstone was asked to act as the Skills Champion by government minister Ed Vaizey, tasked with producing a report reviewing the UK video games industry. The &#x27;NextGen&#x27; report, co-authored with Alex Hope of visual effects firm Double Negative, was released in 2011; Livingstone described it as a &quot;complete bottom up review of the whole education system relating to games.&quot; A school named Livingstone Academy was planned for 2021.

==Awards and honours==

*Livingstone was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2006 New Year Honours, and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours both for services to the computer gaming industry.

<doc id="57756" wikidata="Q325359" url="?curid=57756" title="Laibach">
<text>Laibach () is a Slovenian and Yugoslav avant-garde music group associated with the industrial, martial, and neoclassical genres. Formed in 1980 in the mining town of Trbovlje, Slovenia, at the time a constituent republic within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Laibach represents the musical wing of the Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK) artist collective, a group which Laibach co-founded in 1984.

From the early days, the band was subject to controversies and bans due to their use of iconography with parodies and pastiches of elements from totalitarianism, nationalism and militarism, a concept they have preserved throughout their career. Censored in Yugoslavia, receiving a dissident status and a cult following in their home country, the band embarked on international tours and gradually acquired international fame, which led to wider acceptance by Yugoslav public and to attention of the country&#x27;s mainstream media. After Slovenia became independent in 1991, Laibach&#x27;s status in the country has turned from rejection by a part of the public to promotion into a national cultural icon.

Early Laibach albums were industrial-oriented, marked by heavy rhythms and roaring vocals. Later in the mid-1980s, their sound became more richly layered, featuring samples from pop and classical music. The band&#x27;s lyrics, variously written in Slovene, German and English, are usually delivered by the deep bass vocals of lead vocalist Milan Fras. Initially the lyrics handled war and military themes; later, the focus turned to any highly charged political issue of the moment, sending intentionally ambiguous messages. They recorded a number of cover versions of popular songs, often turning light melodies into sinister-sounding gothic tunes.

The band has seen numerous line-up changes, with Milan Fras (lead vocals), Dejan Knez (bass guitar, keyboads, drums), Ervin Markošek (drums, keyboards, electronics) and Ivan &quot;Jani&quot; Novak (stage effects) forming the best-known line-up. They have worked with a number of collaborators and guest musicians. During their career, Laibach have also recorded film and theatre music and produced works of visual arts, while the band members have embarked on a number of side projects.

== History ==
=== The beginnings: Laibach with Tomaž Hostnik (1980–1982) ===
Laibach evolved from the band Salto Mortale, formed by Dejan Knez in 1978 in a mining industry town of Trbovlje. Laibach was officially formed on 1 June 1980. The members chose 1 June as the official date of the band&#x27;s formation as it was Trbovlje&#x27;s official holiday, marking the 1924 violent clashes between Trbovlje workers and the Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists. The name &quot;Laibach&quot;, adopted after a suggestion from Knez&#x27;s father, is the German language name of the Slovenian capital Ljubljana, a name used during the period when Slovenia was a part of the Habsburg monarchy, as well as during the World War II occupation of Yugoslavia. Initially, the members of the band did not reveal their names, but during its initial phases, the band consisted of Dejan Knez (bass guitar, keyboards, drums, megaphone), Tomaž Hostnik (vocals), Ivan &quot;Jani&quot; Novak (stage effects, credited as &quot;engineer of the human soul&quot;), Andrej Lupinc (bass guitar), Srećko Bajda (synthesizer), Marko Košnik (synthesizer) and Marjan Benčina (synthesizer). In later interviews, the members stated that the band formation was sparked off by the suicide of Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, the death of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito and the beginning of the dissolution of Yugoslavia.

Since its formation, Laibach had been preparing a multimedia project &quot;Rdeči revirji&quot; (&quot;Red District&quot;), a piece intended to challenge and provoke the political authorities in Trbovlje. The project was scheduled to be presented in the Workers&#x27; Hall in Trbovlje. However, the group&#x27;s use of Kazimir Malevich&#x27;s black crosses on their posters was determined by the authorities to be &quot;improper and irresponsible&quot;, leading to considerable negative reaction in the media and the cancellation of the performance of &quot;Red District&quot;.
The band&#x27;s first live appearance and an exhibition entitled &quot;Žrtve letalske nesreče&quot; (&quot;Victims of an Air Accident&quot;) took place in January 1982 at the Ljubljana club FV. It was followed by performances in Zagreb, in Lapidarij club, and in Belgrade, in Students&#x27; Cultural Center&#x27;s foyer. For their live performances they used gramophones, radio devices and electronic instruments that they had built themselves, and the group&#x27;s musical style was characterized by the Yugoslav music press as industrial rock. Instead of dry ice as a source of theatrical smoke, the group used original military smoke bombs, which was as unpleasant for themselves as for the audience. At a concert in Belgrade, the smoke forced part of the audience to escape through the venue&#x27;s windows. In Zagreb, the use of smoke bombs on stage caused a search of the band&#x27;s equipment conducted by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army. The band stated that they used smoke bombs because they were &quot;dealing with military subjects&quot;, which satisfied the officers in charge of the search. At this early stage of their career, Laibach&#x27;s visuals employed mining iconography; eventually, the group would add such symbols as Triglav, deer horns and the Malevich&#x27;s black cross encircled with a gear to their imagery.

At the time of their concerts in Ljubljana, Belgrade and Zagreb, the name Laibach and the posters with black crosses caused controversy, with some seeing this as a direct reference to the occupation of the country in World War II. The newspaper &quot;Delo&quot; published a reader&#x27;s letter which stated: &quot;Is it possible that someone has allowed in Ljubljana, the first Yugoslav city to be awarded the Order of the People&#x27;s Hero, some youth group to carry a name which forcibly tries to revoke the name Laibach?&quot;. The band used this question as the opening for their performance on the Novi rock (&quot;New Rock&quot;) festival in Ljubljana, held on 10 September 1982. For their performance at the festival, frontman Tomaž Hostnik wore a military uniform, and despite being hit in the face by a bottle, causing him serious injuries, managed to bring the performance to an end. A part of the Yugoslav music press described the concert as the &quot;symbolic end of punk rock&quot;.

On 11 December 1982, at the YU Rock Moment festival in Zagreb, the band held the performance entitled &quot;Dotik zla&quot; (&quot;Touch of Evil&quot;). It was Hostnik&#x27;s last performance with Laibach. Ten days later, he committed a ritual suicide by hanging himself from a hayrack—one of the Slovenian national symbols—near his hometown of Medvode. Laibach disapproved of his act of suicide and posthumously &quot;expelled&quot; Hostnik from the group. Despite this, the group would in the future often refer to him and dedicate various projects to him, including an installation entitled &quot;Apologia Laibach&quot;, created around Hostnik&#x27;s self-portrait.

=== Dissident status in Yugoslavia (1983–1985) ===

The group resumed its activities at the beginning of 1983, when they held an exhibition in the Prošireni mediji (&quot;Expanded Media&quot;) gallery in Zagreb. After a number of complaints, the management of the gallery attempted to persuade members of Laibach to remove part of the pieces, which they refused, and only four days after the opening, the management decided to close the exhibition. The band continued their concert activities with the vocalist Milan Fras. The group held a concert in Ljubljana&#x27;s Freedom Hall, featuring guest performances by the English bands Last Few Days and 23 Skidoo. The 30-minutes long recording of dogs barking and snarling were used as the concert intro. The day after the performance, the group received considerable media coverage for a concert at the Zagreb Biennale entitled &quot;Mi kujemo bodočnost&quot; (&quot;We Forge the Future&quot;), during which the group used simultaneous projections of the propaganda film &quot;Revolucija še traja&quot; (&quot;The Revolution is Still Going On&quot;) and a pornographic film. After the simultaneous appearance of late Josip Broz Tito and a penis on the screens, the performance was interrupted by the police, and the members of the band were forcibly removed from the stage.

Following the performance at the Zagreb Biennale, the band published their &quot;manifesto&quot;, entitled &quot;Akcija v imenu&quot; (&quot;Action in the Name Of&quot;), in the &quot;Nova revija&quot; literary magazine, largely thanks to Taras Kermauner, a philosopher, literary historian and one of the magazine editors. In the &quot;manifesto&quot; the band quoted Stalin (&quot;Artists are engineers of the human soul&quot;) and Hitler (&quot;Art is sublime, leading to fanaticism&quot;). The subsequent debut television appearance on 23 June 1983, in the informative-political program &quot;TV tednik&quot; (&quot;TV Weekly&quot;), caused major negative reactions by the public. The members of the band appeared in the program sitting motionlessly, wearing army uniforms and armbands with black crosses. The host of &quot;TV tednik&quot; Jure Pengov stated: &quot;Maybe now someone will react and ban, exterminate this danger, these horrible ideas and beliefs&quot;. After Laibach&#x27;s appearance in &quot;TV tednik&quot;, they were officially banned from using the name Laibach on their records and live appearances, the decision even being printed in the Official Gazette of SR Slovenia. The scandal even led to some of the group members hiding in Pleterje Charterhouse for a short period of time.

The group then, together with Last Few Days, started the international Occupied Europe Tour &#x27;83, which included sixteen dates in eight West European and Eastern Bloc countries. The performances provoked a lot of interest in the European media, especially with the band&#x27;s totalitarian musical and visual style. The socialist background, effective live appearances and a dissident status in their home country provided the group with a swift increase of interest in the Western countries. By combining the imagery of socialist realism, Nazism—which provoked the Slovene WW2 Veteran Organization in Yugoslavia—and Italian futurism, the group created a unique aesthetic style which could not pass unnoticed by the public. In Poland, they provoked the public by declaring themselves the sympathizers of Wojciech Jaruzelski. The statement provoked someone to present them with feces rolled into newspapers during the press conference in Warsaw. At the time of the tour, the song lyrics were mostly in German, but having included cover versions of English language songs, the group would start focusing more on the latter.

In 1984, the band members moved to Great Britain, where they worked as labourers in London, worked at a pier in Belfast and appeared as extras in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. Through the Belgian record label L.A.Y.L.A.H. Anitrecords, the group released their debut record, a 12&quot; single with Slovene language songs &quot;Boji&quot; (&quot;Fights&quot;), &quot;Sila&quot; (&quot;Force&quot;) and &quot;Brat moj&quot; (&quot;My Brother&quot;). At the time, the band also appeared on the various artists album &quot;World National Anthems&quot; released by TRAX International, with their version of the Yugoslav national anthem &quot;Hej, Sloveni&quot;. The band returned to Yugoslavia to prepare an exhibit at Ljubljana&#x27;s Students&#x27; Cultural Center, entitled &quot;The Occupied Europe Tour Documents&quot;, which opened on 5 May 1984. Simultaneously, the band released the live audio cassette &quot;Vstajenje v Berlinu&quot; (&quot;Resurrection in Berlin&quot;).

On 7 October 1984, Laibach officially founded the informal art collective Neue Slowenische Kunst (German for &quot;New Slovene Art&quot;) with visual arts group IRWIN and Scipion Nasice Sisters and Rdeči Pilot (&quot;Red Pilot&quot;) theatre groups. They were later joined by Novi kolektivizam (&quot;New Collectivism&quot;) design studio, Graditelji (&quot;Builders&quot;) architecture bureau, Retrovizija (&quot;Retrovision&quot;) film group and the Odeljenje za čisto in praktično filozofijo (&quot;Section for Clean and Practical Philosophy&quot;) group. The band also started two musical side projects, Germania and 300.000 V.K. On 21 December 1984, Laibach held a concert dedicated to the late Hostnik at the Malči Belič Hall in Ljubljana. Due to the fact that they were still banned from using the name Laibach, they announced the concert with posters featuring only a black cross, the initials of the hall, and date and time of the concert.

The following year, the group released their debut studio album, &quot;Laibach&quot;, through the Ljubljana Students&#x27; Cultural Center&#x27;s label Ropot. Due to the ban of the name Laibach, the cover featured the group&#x27;s trademark black cross without any text. On one of the album tracks, the band used a sample from a speech by Josip Broz Tito, however, it was removed by the state censors. During the same year, the German label WUS released Laibach compilation album &quot;Rekapitulacija 1980–1984&quot; (&quot;Recapitulation 1980–1984&quot;). The recording of their performance at the Neu Konservatiw festival in Hamburg on 15 June 1985 was released on the live album &quot;Neu Konservatiw&quot;. At the end of the year, the band once more held a number of performances in West Germany, this time under the title &quot;Die erste bombardierung – Laibach über dem Deutschland&quot; (&quot;The First Bombing – Laibach Over Germany&quot;). The concerts featured hunting imagery, like axes and trophy antlers, and during the concerts, the band members sawed wood on stage, surrounded by live tranquilized rabbits. 

On 6 February 1986, with the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre, the group premiered their own play &quot;Krst pod Triglavom&quot; (&quot;Baptism Under Triglav&quot;) at the Ljubljana&#x27;s Cankar Hall. The performance was followed by a round table about the ban of the name Laibach, organized in Ljubljana. The discussion featured academics, representatives of political organizations and authorities, including the president of the Assembly of the City of Ljubljana Tina Tomlje. In a TV interview, Tomlje stated that she was informed of the quality of the band&#x27;s works and of the success they had achieved abroad, but that they would not be allowed to perform in Ljubljana under the name Laibach. Soon after, the group released their second studio album, &quot;Nova Akropola&quot; (&quot;The New Acropolis&quot;), via British independent record label Cherry Red Records. After the album release, the League of Socialist Youth of Slovenia on their 12th congress demanded the ban on the usage of the name Laibach to be lifted. The ban was officially lifted on 4 April 1985, and the group performed their first legal concert in Slovenia under the name Laibach already on the following day, in Hum, entitled &quot;Krvava gruda, plodna zemlja&quot; (&quot;Bloody Land, Fertile Soil&quot;). On the Yugoslav Youth Day, the League of Socialist Youth of Slovenia awarded Neue Slowenische Kunst with a plaque, and the League&#x27;s official magazine &quot;Mladina&quot; awarded the collective with the Zlata ptica (&quot;The Golden Bird&quot;) award.

=== International breakthrough, acceptance and wide popularity in Yugoslavia (1986–1991) ===
Laibach&#x27;s following release was the live album &quot;The Occupied Europe Tour 1985&quot;, featuring a choice of recordings from their concerts in Ljubljana, Hamburg and London. In June 1986, the band held four concerts in England, the mini-tour being entitled &quot;Laibach Over America&quot;. During their staying in London, they recorded three songs for a John Peel session, and performed with the Michael Clark dance company in London and Manchester, in the company&#x27;s play &quot;No Fire Escape from Hell&quot;. On 10 October 1986, the group performed in Graz, Austria, on the festival entitled Concert for the Abolishment of Fascist Trade Unions. 

Having signed for Mute Records, Laibach started recording their third studio album, &quot;Opus Dei&quot;, working with composer Slavko Avsenik Jr. The inner sleeve of the cover featured a swastika consisting of four bloodied axes designed by John Heartfield, an anti-Nazi artist. The record was sold secretly in some European countries, as the meaning of the cover was not recognized. The group achieved commercial success with the cover versions of &quot;Live Is Life&quot; by Opus, entitled &quot;Life Is Life&quot;, and &quot;One Vision&quot; by Queen, entitled &quot;Geburt einer Nation&quot; (&quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;), which would mark the direction of their future releases. The track &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; was also well-received by the audience. The usage of the name &quot;Opus Dei&quot; caused the Catholic institution of the same name to sue the group, but the case was eventually decided in favor of Laibach. Following the album release, the group embarked on the United States of Europe Tour, during which they stated at a press conference in France that their influences are Tito, Toto, and Tati. On 7 April 1987, they recorded three more songs for a John Peel session. During May, they once again performed in Clark&#x27;s company &quot;No Fire Escape from Hell&quot; play, in Brighton and Leicester. On 28 July, they presented the work of Neue Slowenische Kunst at the London International Festival of Theatre. With Clark&#x27;s company they performed in Los Angeles, holding three performances in September 1987. In the United States they were invited to a reception hosted by the British ambassador. They appeared on the reception wearing their uniforms, and the actor Walter Gotell (known for his role of General Gogol in James Bond film series), who was also present on the reception, saw this as a provocation. In Yugoslavia, the play was performed at the Belgrade International Theatre Festival, however, performance by Laibach and Tito&#x27;s speeches were omitted. In September 1987, the band also performed in Hamburg&#x27;s Deutsches Schauspielhaus production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, for which they also wrote the music. The music from the play would be released two years later on the album &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

In Yugoslavia, &quot;Opus Dei&quot; was released in November 1987 by the state-owned major label ZKP RTLJ. The release was followed by the double album &quot;Krst pod Triglavom – Baptism&quot;, featuring the music from the play of the same title. The members of the band were invited to a meeting with Jože Osterman, Secretary of the League of Socialist Working People of Ljubljana, who tried to persuade them to change their name to Ljubljana, as, despite the lifting of the ban on the name Laibach, the group&#x27;s name still sparked occasional controversies in their home country. Despite them, the band held a sold-out concert in Ljubljana entitled &quot;Svoji ka svojim&quot; (&quot;To Their Own&quot;), and Yugoslav lifestyle and entertainment magazine &quot;Start&quot; pronounced members of the group the fourth on the list of Best Dressed Men in Yugoslavia. After the performance in Ljubljana, the band went on another European tour, during which they appeared at the end of every concert with horned helmets. On their performance at the Vienna Festival, they provoked the audience with the intro: &quot;Austrians, You Are Germans&quot;, which almost forced organizers to interrupt the concert. Their performance in Amsterdam was a part of European Capital of Culture program. During the band&#x27;s performance on a five-meter–high stage, the performance crew roasted an ox on a stake on the hall&#x27;s balcony.

In October 1988, the group released the album &quot;Let It Be&quot;, featuring cover versions of all the songs from the Beatles album of the same name, with the exception of the title track, which they did not record owing to lack of studio time, and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;; under the title &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;, the band released their versions of German folk songs &quot;Auf der Lüneburger Heide&quot; and &quot;Was Gleicht Wohl Auf Erden&quot;. Their version of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; featured Anja Rupel of the Ljubljana-based synth-pop band Videosex on vocals. A part of the recorded material from the album would be broadcast by Paul McCartney before his concerts.
In 1989, the band went on a North American tour. On their concert in Toronto, they were joined by Austrian artist and art theoretician Peter Weibel, who appeared on stage half-naked with a horned helmet on his head. After their return from North America, they went on a Yugoslav tour, starting with a sold-out concert in Ljubljana&#x27;s Tivoli Hall. Their performance in Zagreb started with the traditional Serbian instrument gusle, and in Belgrade, the NSK philosopher Peter Mlakar held a speech which was a cynical parody of Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s speeches in SAP Kosovo.

The following year, the group released &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, an album of different cover versions of the Rolling Stones song of the same name. The release was followed by European and North American tour. Upon returning to Yugoslavia, the group embarked on a tour across industrial regions of Slovenia. Their concert in Šentjurje was visited by only five people due to poor promotion, but the band nevertheless performed the whole set. The band celebrated their tenth anniversary with a concert held on 21 December 1990 in Trbovlje, at the town&#x27;s thermal power station, which was their first concert in their hometown. At -15°C, the visitors of the concerts were welcomed by a brass band and majorettes. 16 years later Chris Bohn of &quot;The Wire&quot; magazine proclaimed this show as one of the 60 most powerful concerts of all times. After this concert, the group undertook a tour of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

=== Slovenian independence and beyond: new releases and new controversies (1991–present) ===
In 1992, the group released &quot;Kapital&quot;, an album dealing with materialism in contemporary society. The band released the album on vinyl record, audio cassette and compact disc, recording different versions of the same songs for each format of the album. During the same year, they proclaimed the State of NSK, promoting its flag, money, postage stamps and passports. The following year, Mute Records released the &quot;Ljubljana–Zagreb–Beograd&quot; live album, featuring recordings from the 1982 concerts in the three cities, presenting a document of politically active rock from the group&#x27;s early career, especially with the songs &quot;Tito-Tito&quot;, &quot;Država&quot; (&quot;The State&quot;), and &quot;Rdeči molk&quot; (&quot;Red Silence&quot;).

In 1994, they released the album &quot;NATO&quot;, which commented on the current political events in Eastern Europe, former Yugoslavia and the actions of the NATO pact, filtered through their blend of techno and pop. The album featured cover versions of Europe&#x27;s &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, Bolland &amp; Bolland&#x27;s &quot;In the Army Now&quot;, Don Fardon&#x27;s &quot;Indian Reservation&quot; (renamed to &quot;National Reservation&quot;), and Stanislav Binički&#x27;s composition &quot;Marš na Drinu&quot; (&quot;March on the Drina&quot;). During the same year, the band also recorded the song &quot;Zrcalo sveta (Das Spiegelglas der Welt)&quot; (&quot;Mirror of the World&quot;) for the Kraftwerk tribute album &quot;Trans Slovenia Express&quot;, featuring songs by Slovenian acts. The group went on the Occupied Europe NATO Tour 1994-95, provoking the audience in Zagreb and Sarajevo with their performances of &quot;Marš na Drinu&quot;, a Serbian World War I patriotic march. The tour resulted in the box set comprising a live CD and a VHS tape, which featured a selection of recordings from the two-year tour, including the performance in Sarajevo on the date of the signing of the Dayton Agreement. In 1995, the group for a while considered splitting into several simultaneous lineups so that they could perform in different places at the same time, but the idea was abandoned.

The following year, the group released &quot;Jesus Christ Superstars&quot;, featuring their version of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. The group promoted the album in the United States with an eighteen-date tour, followed by a tour across Germany. On 15 May 1997, the band performed with the Slovenian Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Marko Letonja, and the Tone Tomšič Choir, for the opening ceremony of the Ljubljana European Month of Culture, presenting orchestral versions of their earliest material, which they rarely performed live, arranged by Uroš Rojko and Aldo Kumar with the members of the group. During the same year, the live album &quot;M.B. 21 December 1984&quot; was released, featuring recordings from the 1984 secret concert in Ljubljana&#x27;s Malči Belič Hall, the February 1985 concert at the Berlin Atonal festival, and the April 1985 performance at the Zagreb club Kulušić. The performances had featured guest appearance by Jože Pegam on clarinet and trumpet, and some songs included samples of Tito&#x27;s speeches. On 14 November 1997, at a concert in Belgrade, another Peter Mlakar speech received a decidedly mixed audience reaction, in which he asked the audience to &quot;eat the pig and digest it once and for all&quot;, referring to the then-president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Slobodan Milošević.
In 2003, the group released the album &quot;WAT&quot; (an acronym for &quot;We Are Time&quot;), which, alongside new material, featured the song &quot;Tanz mit Laibach&quot; (German for &quot;Dance with Laibach&quot;), inspired by the song &quot;Der Mussolini&quot; by the German band D.A.F. Part of the album lyrics were written by Peter Mlakar, and part of the music was composed by the album producer Iztok Turk (former member of Videosex) and the DJs Umek, Bizzy and Dojaja. In 2003, one of the forming members of the group, Dejan Knez, left Laibach. In 2004, the group released the double compilation album &quot;Anthems&quot;, featuring a career-spanning selection of material, as well as the previously unreleased cover of Drafi Deutscher song &quot;Mama Leone&quot; and remixes of Laibach songs by Random Logic, Umek, Octex, Iztok Turk and others. The compilation also features a thorough group biography written by Alexei Monroe. In 2004, the band released two DVDs: the first, entitled &quot;Laibach&quot;, featured music videos and &quot;A Film about WAT&quot;, directed by Sašo Podgoršek, and the second, entitled &quot;2&quot;, featured a recording from the Occupied Europe NATO Tour concert in Ljubljana held on 26 October 1995 and the documentary film &quot;A Film from Slovenia&quot;, directed by Daniel Landin and Peter Vezjak.

During 2006, the group released the album &quot;Volk&quot; (the title meaning &quot;Wolf&quot; in Slovene and &quot;People&quot; in German), featuring cover versions of national anthems, including the NSK &quot;state anthem&quot; &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot;, originally written in 1797 and used as German national anthem during the Weimar Republic. Each cover featured a guest vocalist singing the anthem in their own language, with the exception of the cover of the &quot;State Anthem of the Russian Federation&quot;, which was entitled &quot;Rossiya&quot; and featured a choir composed mostly of the children of Russian and Ukrainian diplomats in Slovenia. During the same year, on 1 June, the group performed J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; in Bach&#x27;s hometown Leipzig, and their interpretation of the work was released on the album &quot;Laibachkunstderfuge&quot; in 2008. In 2007, the group released the DVD &quot;Live at the CC Club&quot;, featuring the recording of their London concert held on 16 April 2007. The 2008 DVD &quot;Volk Dead in Trbovlje&quot; featured the recording of the band&#x27;s performance held in Trbovlje&#x27;s Worker&#x27;s Hall on 23 March 2007, as well as music videos for the songs from &quot;Volk&quot; and a documentary about the tour entitled &quot;Volk Tour Medley&quot;, all directed by Sašo Podgoršek. 
In 2011, the group released the box set &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk – Dokument 81–82&quot; (&quot;Total Work of Art – Document 81–82&quot;), featuring five vinyl records and a DVD with unreleased studio recordings from the early phases of their career. The compilation was released in a limited number of 600 copies only. During the same year, the band recorded a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot;, recorded for the tribute album &quot;Projekt Bob Dylan: Postani prostovoljec!&quot; (&quot;Project Bob Dylan: Become a Volunteer!&quot;), commissioned by the American Embassy in Ljubljana in honor of Dylan&#x27;s 70th birthday. The band was hired by director Timo Vuorensola to compose music for his science fiction comedy film &quot;Iron Sky&quot;, and it was released on the soundtrack album &quot;Iron Sky&quot; in 2012. The double album &quot;Iron Sky Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; featured their music originally composed for &quot;Iron Sky&quot;, but eventually not used in the film. On 14 April 2012, in the Tate Modern Turbine Hall the band held a concert which was envisioned as the recreation of their 1983 concert at Zagreb Biennalle, with guest appearances by some of the group&#x27;s early members. The recording of the concert was released on the double live album &quot;Monumental Retro-Avant-Garde&quot;.

In 2014, Laibach released the album &quot;Spectre&quot;, the title referring to the first line of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;. The band dedicated the album songs &quot;Eurovision&quot;, &quot;The Whistleblowers&quot; (musically based on &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;), &quot;We Are Millions and Millions Are One&quot; (featuring new member Mina Špiler on lead vocals) and &quot;No History&quot; to Julian Assange and Edward Snowden. The deluxe edition of the album featured four bonus tracks, including a cover of Blind Lemon Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;See That My Grave Is Kept Clean&quot; and Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;Love on the Beat&quot;, and a book entitled &quot;Spectre Playbook&quot;, a Laibach &quot;manifesto&quot; with a goal of uniting social activists from around the world. The album &quot;Spectremix&quot;, released in 2015, featured &quot;Spectre&quot; songs remixes by Marcel Dettmann, Gramatik, Iztok Turk and other artists. During 2014, the band was invited by National Cultural Centre of Poland to record music for the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. The band released the material on the EP &quot;1 VIII 1944 Warszawa&quot;, featuring a version of the classic song of the insurgency &quot;Warszawskie Dzieci&quot; (&quot;Children of Warsaw&quot;), 

In August 2015, on the initiative of Norwegian director Morten Traavik, the band performed in Pyongyang, North Korea. The band held two concerts, on 19 and 20 August, at Kim Won Gyun Musical Conservatory in Nampo-dong, Pyongyang, to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the end of Japanese rule of Korea. The concerts saw large attention of the Western media, a part of which described Laibach&#x27;s upcoming performance as the first performance of a Western rock band in North Korea, although this was later revealed to be a misinformation. The concerts were the subject of the documentary film &quot;Liberation Day&quot; by Morten Traavik and Uģis Olte, which premiered in 2016. In 2017, the band performed in South Korea, becoming the only musical band in the world to have performed in both countries.

In July 2017, Laibach released the album &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot;. The songs on the album were originally composed for a theatrical production of &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, based on Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s novel of the same name, directed by Matjaž Berger and premiering in the Anton Podbevšek Theatre in Novo Mesto. In 2018, the group released the album &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, featuring their versions of the songs from the film of the same name. The band had previously performed these songs on their North Korea performances, choosing them because they are well-known in the country. The album included their version of the Korean folk song &quot;Arirang&quot;, in which the band used traditional Korean instrument gayageum.

In 2020, the band released the box set &quot;Revisited&quot;, featuring a reissue of their debut album with bonus tracks, new versions of their songs from the first half of the 1980s, and two live recordings – one with the Radio-Television Slovenia Symphony Orchestra, and the other with the Lviv Philharmonic Orchestra. The box set included the release entitled &quot;Underground&quot;, with a recording of one of three performances the group held in 2017 in Velenje Mine, 200 meters under the ground. The 2021 live album &quot;We Forge the Future – Live at Reina Sofia&quot; featured the recording of the concert held at Madrid&#x27;s Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía on 26 November 2017 and dedicated to their 1983 Zagreb Biennale performance. The release featured the book &quot;Terror of History&quot;, with texts by journalist Igor Vidmar, author Marcel Stefančić and former president of Slovenia Milan Kučan. In 2022, Laibach released the album &quot;Wir sind das Volk (ein Musical das Deutschland)&quot; (&quot;We are the People (a Musical of Germany)&quot;) with the music from the theatre play &quot;We Are the People&quot;, based on the works of Heiner Müller, which premiered in Berlin&#x27;s Hebbel am Ufer center on 8 February 2020. On their 5 and 6 September 2022 performances at the Ljubljana Summer Festival, the band presented their symphonic work &quot;Alamut&quot;, based on the 1938 novel &quot;Alamut&quot; by Vladimir Bartol. The symphony was created in cooperation with Iranian composers Nima A.Rowshan and Idin Samimi Mofakham. The band performed the symphony with the Radio-Television of Slovenia Symphony Orchestra, vocal group Gallina, Tehran choir Human Voice Ensemble and AccordiOna accordion orchestra. Following the premiere in Ljubljana, &quot;Alamut&quot; got its first European tour the following year.

Laibach was scheduled to perform in Kyiv on 31 March 2023. However, the band&#x27;s description of the Russo-Ukrainian War as a proxy war angered many Ukrainians and the concert was canceled. In 2023, the band released their latest studio album &quot;Sketches from the Red District&quot; and the EP &quot;Love Is Still Alive&quot;, the latter featuring the songs written by the band for the 2019 &quot;Iron Sky&quot; sequel &quot;Iron Sky: The Coming Race&quot;. In 2024, the band released several singles: an atonal cover of Billie Holiday&#x27;s &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, a cover of &quot;White Christmas&quot;, recorded with Slovenian electronic duo Silence, and a Slovene language cover of Bijelo Dugme song &quot;Top&quot; (&quot;Cannon&quot;), entitled &quot;S topom te bom ciljal moja mala&quot; (&quot;I Will Shot You With a Cannon, Baby&quot;). The latter was recorded in cooperation with Bijelo Dugme&#x27;s leader Goran Bregović as a part of marking 50 years since Bijelo Dugme formation. The song featured Laibach&#x27;s old collaborator Vasja Ulrih on lead vocals, with the accompanying music video, featuring excerpts from Laibach and Bijelo Dugme music videos and live recordings, compiled by Bregović and Laibach.

== Musical style ==
Early Laibach works were described as industrial rock by Yugoslav music press. The band&#x27;s early releases were marked by heavy rhythms and roaring vocals. In the mid-1980s, with incorporating the covers of popular songs into their repertoire, the band&#x27;s sound became more richly layered, featuring samples from pop and classical music.

Laibach&#x27;s cover versions are often used to subvert the original message or intention of the song, a notable example being their version of the song &quot;Live Is Life&quot; by the Austrian pop rock band Opus. Laibach recorded two versions of the song, titled &quot;Leben heißt Leben&quot; and &quot;Opus Dei&quot;. The first, the opening song on the Laibach album &quot;Opus Dei&quot;, was sung in German. The second was promoted as a single, and its promotional video (which used the title &quot;Life Is Life&quot;) was played extensively on American cable channel MTV. &quot;Opus Dei&quot; retained some of the original song&#x27;s English lyrics, but was delivered in a musical style that left the meaning of the lyrics open to interpretation. Whereas the original is a feel-good pop anthem, Laibach&#x27;s interpretation twists the melody into a triumphant military march. With the exception of the promotional video, the refrain is at one point translated into German, giving an example of the sensitivity of lyrics to their context. The &quot;Opus Dei&quot; album also features a cover of Queen&#x27;s &quot;One Vision&quot; with lyrics translated into German under the title &#x27;&quot;Geburt einer Nation&quot; (&quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;), revealing the ambiguity of lines like &quot;One race one hope / One real decision&quot;.
Laibach not only references modern artists through reinterpretation, but also samples or reinvents older musical pieces. For example, their song &quot;Anglia&quot;, released on &quot;Volk&quot;, is based on the national anthem of the United Kingdom, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. They have also toured with an audio-visual performance centered on Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Die Kunst der Fuge&quot;. Since this work has no specifications of acquired instruments and is furthermore based on mathematical principles, Laibach has argued that the music can be seen as proto-techno. Therefore, the band found &quot;Die Kunst der Fuge&quot; to be ideal for an interpretation using computers and software. In 2009, Laibach reworked Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Overture to Tannhäuser&quot;, &quot;Siegfried-Idyll&quot; and &quot;The Ride Of The Valkyries&quot; in collaboration with the RTV Slovenia Symphonic Orchestra, conducted by Izidor Leitinger. Laibach&#x27;s version is titled &quot;VolksWagner&quot;.

In addition to cover songs, Laibach has remixed songs by other bands. These include two songs by the Florida death metal band Morbid Angel that appear on the Morbid Angel EP &quot;Laibach Re-mixes&quot;.

== Aesthetics, image and controversy ==

At the early stage of their career, Laibach&#x27;s visuals employed socialist realist mining iconography, and later the band incorporated, alongside influences from socialist realism, influences from Nazi art and Italian futurism to their imagery. On their early promotional posters the band used black crosses from the works of Russian avant-garde artist and art theorist Kazimir Malevich, later incorporating a black cross into their logo, consisting of a cross encircled with a gear. In the mid-1980s, when the usage of the name Laibach was banned in Yugoslavia, the group used posters with black crosses without band name to advertise their performances, and their debut album was released with the black cross and without any text on the cover. Cross imagery, and variations on the cross are apparent in many Laibach recordings and publications. Some Laibach releases feature artwork by the communist and early Dada artist John Heartfield. The usage of Heartfield&#x27;s anti-Nazi work depicting swastika consisting of four bloodied axes on the inner sleeve of the album &quot;Opus Dei&quot; caused controversies in some European countries.

The visual imagery of Laibach&#x27;s art has been described as &quot;radically ambiguous&quot;. An early example of this ambiguity would be the woodcut entitled &quot;The Thrower&quot;, also known as &quot;Metalec&quot; (&quot;The Metal Worker&quot;). This work features a monochrome silhouette of a figure with a clenched fist holding a hammer aloft. The work could be seen both as promoting industrial protest or as a symbol of industrial pride. Another aspect of this woodcut is the large typefaced word &quot;LAIBACH&quot;, evoking memories of the Nazi occupation of Slovenia. This piece was featured prominently during the band&#x27;s 1983 interview for &quot;TV tednik&quot;.

Laibach has frequently been accused of both far left and far right political stances due to their use of uniforms and totalitarian-style aesthetics. They were also accused of being neo-nationalists. When confronted with such accusations, Laibach is quoted as replying with the ambiguous response &quot;We are fascists as much as Hitler was a painter&quot;. Laibach concerts have sometimes aesthetically appeared as political rallies, and the members of Laibach are notorious for rarely stepping out of character. When interviewed, they often answer in wry manifestos, showing a paradoxical lust for, and condemnation of, authority.

Finnish author and nationalist Tuomas Tähti disclosed in his 2019 book &quot;Nationalistin henkinen horisontti&quot; that Laibach member Ivan &quot;Jani&quot; Novak told him in March 2015 that the band is a communist group and most of their work is connected to communism.

British musician and journalist Richard Wolfson wrote of the group:

Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek stated about the group after their performance in North Korea:

== Legacy, influence and innovation ==
Despite emerging on the rich and vibrant Yugoslav rock scene, Laibach is widely considered to be the only Yugoslav band to achieve large popularity in Western Europe during the existence of SFR Yugoslavia. The band has influenced a number of acts, has been paid tribute by several projects and has been a subject of several books and documentary films.

=== Tributes ===
In 1999, a tribute album to Laibach entitled &quot;Schlecht und Ironisch – Laibach Tribut&quot; (&quot;Bad and Ironic – Laibach Tribute&quot;) was released. Canadian industrial doom metal band Zaraza released a Laibach tribute EP entitled &quot;Montrealska Akropola – A Tribute to Laibach&quot; (&quot;Montreal Acropolis – A Tribute to Laibach&quot;) in 2004.

=== Martial music ===
Some early material by Laibach and later neoclassical releases by the band, such as the album &quot;Macbeth&quot;, were influential on certain artists within the martial industrial music genre.

=== Rammstein ===
Laibach is often cited as an influence for the popular German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. The parallel is regularly made between the bands regarding their aesthetics and deep male vocals both groups share and with their respective backgrounds of originating from former socialist countries.

When asked about the topic in an interview, the guitar player of Rammstein, Richard Kruspe, claimed Rammstein to have a more emotional approach instead of the more &quot;intellectual&quot; style of Laibach. In the same interview the keyboard player of Rammstein Christian Lorenz drew a parallel between the deep voices of Till Lindemann and Milan Fras but considered this to be the only similarity between the two music groups. The documentary film &quot;Liberation Day&quot; ends with a notice stating that a member of a certain industrial metal band was supposed to be interviewed for the film about the influence Laibach had on their earlier work, but it had to be removed due to the prospect of arrest or a fine from the district court of Berlin towards the makers of the film. This, and the early promotional material for the film suggest that it was Paul Landers who was to appear in the film. 

When members of Laibach were asked by an interviewer about Rammstein &quot;stealing&quot; from them, they responded: &quot;Laibach does not believe in originality... Therefore, Rammstein could not &#x27;steal&#x27; much from us. They simply let themselves get inspired by our work, which is absolutely a legitimate process. We are glad that they made it. In a way, they have proven once again that a good &#x27;copy&#x27; can make more money on the market than the &#x27;original&#x27;. Anyhow, today we share the territory: Rammstein seem to be a kind of Laibach for adolescents and Laibach are Rammstein for grown-ups.&quot; Laibach would later provide a remix for the Rammstein single &quot;Ohne dich&quot;.

=== Rankings ===
Laibach album &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; was proclaimed in 2006 the 7th on &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; list of Ten Greatest Tribute Albums of All Time. The album &quot;Opus Dei&quot; was included in 2008 in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The same album was polled in 2015 as the 86th on the list of 100 Greatest Yugoslav Albums published by the Croatian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

== Members ==

Laibach evolved from the band Salto Mortale, formed in 1978 by Dejan Knez. The first incarnation of Laibach formed in 1980 included Dejan Knez, Tomaž Hostnik, Srečko Bajda, Andrej Lupinc, and Marko Košnik. Soon after that, Knez&#x27;s relative Ivan &quot;Jani&quot; Novak and Milan Fras joined the band. First a quintet, Laibach quickly became a quartet and declared that the group had four members: &quot;Vier Personen&quot;.

From mid-1980s to mid-1990s, while the core quartet included Dejan Knez, Milan Fras, Ervin Markošek and Ivan &quot;Jani&quot; Novak, the members frequently used the pseudonyms Dachauer, Keller, Saliger and Eber. The pseudonym Ivo Saliger was originally used by original singer Tomaž Hostnik and more recently by Ivan Novak. The pseudonym Elk Eber has been used by Dejan Knez. Former member Andrej Lupinc has continued to use the pseudonym Keller after leaving the band. Occasionally, other musicians supplemented the core group, some of whom included Oto Rimele (former guitarist for Lačni Franz), Nikola Sekulović (bass player for Demolition Group), and Anja Rupel (vocalist for Videosex and a solo artist).

On 20 June 2015, the band held a sound performance entitled &quot;Musical Nocturne&quot; with their most famous line-up of Knez, Novak, Fras and Markošek.

== Appearances in popular culture ==
* In 1989, on his second studio album &quot;Hoćemo gusle&quot; (&quot;We Want Gusle&quot;), Yugoslav alternative rock musician Rambo Amadeus recorded a Laibach parody song &quot;Samit u burekdžinici Laibach&quot; (&quot;Summit in the Burek-Bakery Laibach&quot;), featuring the song lyrics from the poems &quot;Santa Maria della Salute&quot; (&quot;Saint Mary of Health&quot;) by Laza Kostić and &quot;Strepnja&quot; (&quot;Trepidation&quot;) by Desanka Maksimović and the chorus from the turbo folk song &quot;Čaše lomim, ruke mi krvave&quot; (&quot;I Break the Glasses, My Hands Are Bleeding&quot;). A promotional video was also recorded for the track, parodying Laibach videos and aesthetics.
* Von Bach, a fictional supervillain modeled after Milan Fras, appears in the DC Comics graphic novel &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, by Alex Ross and Mark Waid. Von Bach appears dressed in Laibach-style uniform and displays the group&#x27;s cross tattooed on his chest. He is described as follows: &quot;German-speaking superhuman and would-be dictator is the example of the Hitleresque villain that had so much symbolic importance in the Golden Age of comic books. The blocky cross on his chest is evocative of the kind of bold symbols used by fascists. Von Bach has the words &#x27;Liebe&#x27; (love) and &#x27;Hass&#x27; (hate) tattooed on his arms and, in fact, his entire body has been covered with one large tattoo of that dark color that most tattoos become, with his natural flesh color only coming through in the designs on his body&quot;. On the NSK State website, the band states they have &quot;been paid with uncommon honour&quot; by this.
* Laibach&#x27;s version of the Juno Reactor song &quot;God Is God&quot; (which was itself inspired by Laibach&#x27;s cover of Opus&#x27;s song &quot;Live Is Life&quot;) from the album &quot;Jesus Christ Superstars&quot; appears on the second soundtrack disc for the computer game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot;, which was released only in the German release of the Special Edition pack, and on the album &quot;The Blair Witch Project: Josh&#x27;s Blair Witch Mix&quot;.

<text>The Ebola River ( or ), also commonly known by its Ngbandi name Legbala, is the headstream of the Mongala River, a tributary of the Congo River, in northern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is roughly in length.

The name &quot;Ebola&quot; is a French corruption of &quot;Legbala&quot;, its name in Ngbandi which means &#x27;white water&#x27;. During the Belgian administration these names were interchangeable along with the French names &quot;Eau Blanche&quot; and rarely &quot;L&#x27;Ébola&quot;.

In 1976, Ebola virus was first identified in Yambuku, from the Ebola River, but the virologist Karl Johnson decided to name it after the river so that the town would not be associated with the disease&#x27;s stigma. Thus, the river is eponymous to the terms Ebola virus, &quot;Ebolavirus&quot;, and Ebola virus disease (usually referred to as simply &quot;Ebola&quot;).

<doc id="57759" wikidata="Q551338" url="?curid=57759" title="Biophoton">
<text>Biophotons (from the Greek βίος meaning &quot;life&quot; and φῶς meaning &quot;light&quot;) are photons of light in the ultraviolet and low visible light range that are produced by a biological system. They are non-thermal in origin, and the emission of biophotons is technically a type of bioluminescence, though the term &quot;bioluminescence&quot; is generally reserved for higher luminance systems (typically with emitted light visible to the naked eye, using biochemical means such as luciferin/luciferase). The term &quot;biophoton&quot; used in this narrow sense should not be confused with the broader field of biophotonics, which studies the general interaction of light with biological systems.

Biological tissues typically produce an observed radiant emittance in the visible and ultraviolet frequencies ranging from 10−17 to 10−23 W/cm2 (approx 1-1000 photons/cm2/second). This low level of light has a much weaker intensity than the visible light produced by bioluminescence, but biophotons are detectable above the background of thermal radiation that is emitted by tissues at their normal temperature.

While detection of biophotons has been reported by several groups, hypotheses that such biophotons indicate the state of biological tissues and facilitate a form of cellular communication are still under investigation, Alexander Gurwitsch, who discovered the existence of biophotons, was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1941 for his work.

==Detection and measurement==
Biophotons may be detected with photomultipliers or by means of an ultra low noise CCD camera to produce an image, using an exposure time of typically 15 minutes for plant materials. Photomultiplier tubes have been used to measure biophoton emissions from fish eggs, and some applications have measured biophotons from animals and humans. Electron Multiplying CCD (EM-CCD) optimized for the detection of ultraweak light have also been used to detect the bioluminescence produced by yeast cells at the onset of their growth.

The typical observed radiant emittance of biological tissues in the visible and ultraviolet frequencies ranges from 10−17 to 10−23 W/cm2 with a photon count from a few to nearly 1000 photons per cm2 in the range of 200 nm to 800 nm.

== Proposed physical mechanisms ==

Chemi-excitation via oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species or catalysis by enzymes (i.e., peroxidase, lipoxygenase) is a common event in the biomolecular . Such reactions can lead to the formation of triplet excited species, which release photons upon returning to a lower energy level in a process analogous to phosphorescence. That this process is a contributing factor to spontaneous biophoton emission has been indicated by studies demonstrating that biophoton emission can be increased by depleting assayed tissue of antioxidants or by addition of carbonyl derivatizing agents. Further support is provided by studies indicating that emission can be increased by addition of reactive oxygen species.

===Plants===
Imaging of biophotons from leaves has been used as a method for assaying R gene responses. These genes and their associated proteins are responsible for pathogen recognition and activation of defense signaling networks leading to the hypersensitive response, which is one of the mechanisms of the resistance of plants to pathogen infection. It involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have crucial roles in signal transduction or as toxic agents leading to cell death.

Biophotons have been also observed in the roots of stressed plants. In healthy cells, the concentration of ROS is minimized by a system of biological antioxidants. However, heat shock and other stresses changes the equilibrium between oxidative stress and antioxidant activity, for example, the rapid rise in temperature induces biophoton emission by ROS.

===Hypothesized involvement in cellular communication===
In the 1920s, the Russian embryologist Alexander Gurwitsch reported &quot;ultraweak&quot; photon emissions from living tissues in the UV-range of the spectrum. He named them &quot;mitogenetic rays&quot; because his experiments convinced him that they had a stimulating effect on cell division.

In the 1970s Fritz-Albert Popp and his research group at the University of Marburg (Germany) showed that the spectral distribution of the emission fell over a wide range of wavelengths, from 200 to 750 nm. Popp&#x27;s work on the biophoton emission&#x27;s statistical properties, namely the claims on its coherence, was criticised for lack of scientific rigour.

One biophoton mechanism focuses on injured cells that are under higher levels of oxidative stress, which is one source of light, and can be deemed to constitute a &quot;distress signal&quot; or background chemical process, but this mechanism is yet to be demonstrated. The difficulty of teasing out the effects of any supposed biophotons amid the other numerous chemical interactions between cells makes it difficult to devise a testable hypothesis. A 2010 review article discusses various published theories on this kind of signaling.

The hypothesis of cellular communication by biophotons was highly criticised for failing to explain how could cells detect photonic signals several orders of magnitude weaker than the natural background illumination.

<doc id="57761" wikidata="Q240642" url="?curid=57761" title="Valproate">
<text>Valproate (valproic acid, VPA, sodium valproate, and valproate semisodium forms) are medications primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and prevent migraine headaches. They are useful for the prevention of seizures in those with absence seizures, partial seizures, and generalized seizures. They can be given intravenously or by mouth, and the tablet forms exist in both long- and short-acting formulations.
Common side effects of valproate include nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and dry mouth. Serious side effects can include liver failure, and regular monitoring of liver function tests is therefore recommended. Other serious risks include pancreatitis and an increased suicide risk. Valproate is known to cause serious abnormalities or birth defects in the unborn child if taken during pregnancy, and is contra-indicated for women of childbearing age unless the drug is essential to their medical condition and the person is also prescribed a contraceptive. Reproductive warnings have also been issued for men using the drug. The United States Food and Drug Administration has indicated a black box warning given the frequency and severity of the side effects and teratogenicity. Additionally, there is also a black box warning due to risk of hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis. As of 2022 the drug was still prescribed in the UK to potentially pregnant women, but use declined by 51% from 2018–19 to 2020–21.
Valproate&#x27;s precise mechanism of action is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include affecting GABA levels, blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, inhibiting histone deacetylases, and increasing LEF1. Valproic acid is a branched short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), a derivative of valeric acid.
Valproate was originally synthesized in 1881 and came into medical use in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 174th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
Valproate or valproic acid is used primarily to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and to prevent migraine headaches.

===Epilepsy===

Valproate has a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity, although it is primarily used as a first-line treatment for tonic–clonic seizures, absence seizures and myoclonic seizures and as a second-line treatment for partial seizures and infantile spasms. It has also been successfully given intravenously to treat status epilepticus.

In the US, valproic acid is also prescribed as an anti-epileptic drug indicated for the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder; monotherapy and adjunctive therapy of complex partial seizures and simple and complex absence seizures; adjunctive therapy in people with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures.

===Mental illness===
Valproate products are used to treat manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder.

A 2016 systematic review compared the efficacy of valproate as an add-on for people with schizophrenia:
===Other neurological indications===
Based upon five case reports, valproic acid may have efficacy in controlling the symptoms of the dopamine dysregulation syndrome that arise from the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease with levodopa.

Valproate is not commonly used to prevent or treat migraine headaches, but it may be prescribed if other medications are not effective.

===Other===
The medication has been tested in the treatment of AIDS and cancer, owing to its histone-deacetylase-inhibiting effects. It has cardioprotective, kidney protective, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial effects.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications include:
* Pre-existing acute or chronic liver dysfunction or family history of severe liver inflammation (hepatitis), particularly medicine related.
* Pregnancy 11% risk of birth defects and 30-40% risk of neuro-developmental disabilities which can be permanent
* Known hypersensitivity to valproate or any of the ingredients used in the preparation
* Urea cycle disorders
* Hepatic porphyria
* Hepatotoxicity
* Mitochondrial disease
* Pancreatitis
* Porphyria

==Adverse effects==
Most common adverse effects include:
* Nausea (22%)
* Drowsiness (19%)
* Dizziness (12%)
* Vomiting (12%)
* Weakness (10%)

Serious adverse effects include:
* Bleeding
* Low blood platelets
* Encephalopathy
* Suicidal behavior and thoughts
* Low body temperature
Valproic acid has a black box warning for hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and fetal abnormalities.

There is evidence that valproic acid may cause premature growth plate ossification in children and adolescents, resulting in decreased height. Valproic acid can also cause mydriasis, a dilation of the pupils. There is evidence that shows valproic acid may increase the chance of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder. Studies have shown this risk of PCOS is higher in women with epilepsy compared to those with bipolar disorder. Weight gain is also possible.

===Pregnancy===
===Elderly===
Valproate may cause increased somnolence in the elderly. In a trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia, a significantly higher portion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo. In approximately one-half of such patients, there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss.

==Overdose and toxicity==
Excessive amounts of valproic acid can result in somnolence, tremor, stupor, respiratory depression, coma, metabolic acidosis, and death. In general, serum or plasma valproic acid concentrations are in a range of 20–100 mg/L during controlled therapy, but may reach 150–1500 mg/L following acute poisoning. Monitoring of the serum level is often accomplished using commercial immunoassay techniques, although some laboratories employ gas or liquid chromatography.
In contrast to other antiepileptic drugs, at present there is little favorable evidence for salivary therapeutic drug monitoring. Salivary levels of valproic acid correlate poorly with serum levels, partly due to valproate&#x27;s weak acid property (p&quot;K&quot;a of 4.9).

In severe intoxication, hemoperfusion or hemofiltration can be an effective means of hastening elimination of the drug from the body. Supportive therapy should be given to all patients experiencing an overdose and urine output should be monitored. Supplemental -carnitine is indicated in patients having an acute overdose and also prophylactically in high risk patients. Acetyl--carnitine lowers hyperammonemia less markedly than -carnitine. 

== Interactions ==

Valproate inhibits CYP2C9, glucuronyl transferase, and epoxide hydrolase and is highly protein bound and hence may interact with drugs that are substrates for any of these enzymes or are highly protein bound themselves. It may also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of alcohol. It should not be given in conjunction with other antiepileptics due to the potential for reduced clearance of other antiepileptics (including carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and phenobarbitone) and itself. It may also interact with:
* Aspirin: may increase valproate concentrations. May also interfere with valproate&#x27;s metabolism.
* Benzodiazepines: may cause CNS depression and there are possible pharmacokinetic interactions.
* Carbapenem antibiotics: reduce valproate levels, potentially leading to seizures.
* Cimetidine: inhibits valproate&#x27;s metabolism in the liver, leading to increased valproate concentrations.
* Erythromycin: inhibits valproate&#x27;s metabolism in the liver, leading to increased valproate concentrations.
* Ethosuximide: valproate may increase ethosuximide concentrations and lead to toxicity.
* Felbamate: may increase plasma concentrations of valproate.
* Mefloquine: may increase valproate metabolism combined with the direct epileptogenic effects of mefloquine.
* Oral contraceptives: may reduce plasma concentrations of valproate.
* Primidone: may accelerate metabolism of valproate, leading to a decline of serum levels and potential breakthrough seizure.
* Rifampicin: increases the clearance of valproate, leading to decreased valproate concentrations.
* Warfarin: valproate may increase free warfarin concentration and prolong bleeding time.
* Zidovudine: valproate may increase zidovudine serum concentration and lead to toxicity.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Although the mechanism of action of valproate is not fully understood, traditionally, its anticonvulsant effect has been attributed to the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels and increased brain levels of the inhibitory synaptic neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The GABAergic effect is also believed to contribute towards the anti-manic properties of valproate. In animals, sodium valproate raises cerebral and cerebellar levels of GABA, possibly by inhibiting GABA degradative enzymes, such as GABA transaminase, succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and by inhibiting the re-uptake of GABA by neuronal cells.
Prevention of neurotransmitter-induced hyperexcitability of nerve cells via Kv7.2 channel and AKAP5 may also contribute to its mechanism. Valproate has been shown to protect against a seizure-induced reduction in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) as a potential therapeutic mechanism.

Valproate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor. By inhibition of histone deacetylase, it promotes more transcriptionally active chromatin structures, that is it exerts an epigenetic effect. This has been proven in mice: Valproic acid induced histone hyperacetylation had brain function effects on the next generation of mice through changes in sperm DNA methylation. Intermediate molecules include VEGF, BDNF, and GDNF.

====Endocrine actions====
Valproic acid has been found to be an antagonist of the androgen and progesterone receptors, and hence as a nonsteroidal antiandrogen and antiprogestogen, at concentrations much lower than therapeutic serum levels. In addition, the drug has been identified as a potent aromatase inhibitor, and suppresses estrogen concentrations. These actions are likely to be involved in the reproductive endocrine disturbances seen with valproic acid treatment.

Valproic acid has been found to directly stimulate androgen biosynthesis in the gonads via inhibition of histone deacetylases and has been associated with hyperandrogenism in women and increased 4-androstenedione levels in men. High rates of polycystic ovary syndrome and menstrual disorders have also been observed in women treated with valproic acid.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Taken by mouth, valproate is rapidly and virtually completely absorbed from the gut. When in the bloodstream, 80–90% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Protein binding is saturable: it decreases with increasing valproate concentration, low albumin concentrations, the patient&#x27;s age, additional use of other drugs such as aspirin, as well as liver and kidney impairment. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and in breast milk are 1 to 10% of blood plasma concentrations.

The vast majority of valproate metabolism occurs in the liver. Valproate is known to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A5. It is also known to be metabolized by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT1A10, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15. Some of the known metabolites of valproate by these enzymes and uncharacterized enzymes include (see image):
* via glucuronidation (30–50%): valproic acid β-O-glucuronide
* via beta oxidation (&gt;40%): 2&quot;E&quot;-ene-valproic acid, 2&quot;Z&quot;-ene-valproic acid, 3-hydroxyvalproic acid, 3-oxovalproic acid
* via omega oxidation: 5-hydroxyvalproic acid, 2-propyl-glutaric acid
* some others: 3&quot;E&quot;-ene-valproic acid, 3&quot;Z&quot;-ene-valproic acid, 4-ene-valproic acid, 4-hydroxyvalproic acid
All in all, over 20 metabolites are known.

In adult patients taking valproate alone, 30–50% of an administered dose is excreted in urine as the glucuronide conjugate. The other major pathway in the metabolism of valproate is mitochondrial beta oxidation, which typically accounts for over 40% of an administered dose. Typically, less than 20% of an administered dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose of valproate is excreted unchanged (i.e., as valproate) in urine. Only a small amount is excreted via the faeces. Elimination half-life is 16±3 hours and can decrease to 4–9 hours when combined with enzyme inducers.

==Chemistry==
Valproic acid is a branched short-chain fatty acid and the 2-&quot;n&quot;-propyl derivative of valeric acid.

==History==
Valproic acid was first synthesized in 1882 by Beverly S. Burton as an analogue of valeric acid, found naturally in valerian. Valproic acid is a carboxylic acid, a clear liquid at room temperature. For many decades, its only use was in laboratories as a &quot;metabolically inert&quot; solvent for organic compounds. In 1962, the French researcher Pierre Eymard serendipitously discovered the anticonvulsant properties of valproic acid while using it as a vehicle for a number of other compounds that were being screened for antiseizure activity. He found it prevented pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in laboratory rats. It was approved as an antiepileptic drug in 1967 in France and has become the most widely prescribed antiepileptic drug worldwide. Valproic acid has also been used for migraine prophylaxis and bipolar disorder.

==Society and culture==

Valproate is available as a generic medication.

===Approval status===

===Off-label uses===
In 2012, pharmaceutical company Abbott paid $1.6 billion in fines to US federal and state governments for illegal promotion of off-label uses for Depakote, including the sedation of elderly nursing home residents.

Some studies have suggested that valproate may reopen the critical period for learning absolute pitch and possibly other skills such as language.

===Formulations===

Valproate exists in two main molecular variants: &quot;sodium valproate&quot; and &quot;valproic acid without sodium&quot; (often implied by simply &quot;valproate&quot;). A mixture between these two is termed &quot;semisodium valproate&quot;. It is unclear whether there is any difference in efficacy between these variants, except from the fact that about 10% more mass of &quot;sodium valproate&quot; is needed than &quot;valproic acid without sodium&quot; to compensate for the sodium itself.

===Terminology===
Valproate is a negative ion. The conjugate acid of valproate is valproic acid (VPA). Valproic acid is fully ionized into valproate at the physiologic pH of the human body, and valproate is the active form of the drug. Sodium valproate is the sodium salt of valproic acid. Divalproex sodium is a coordination complex composed of equal parts of valproic acid and sodium valproate.

== Research ==
A 2023 systematic review of the literature identified only one study in which valproate was evaluated in the treatment of seizures in infants aged 1 to 36 months. In a randomized control trial, valproate alone was found to show poorer outcomes for infants than valproate plus levetiracetam in terms of reduction of seizures, freedom from seizures, daily living ability, quality of life, and cognitive abilities.

<text>A psychiatric or psychotropic medication is a psychoactive drug taken to exert an effect on the chemical makeup of the brain and nervous system. Thus, these medications are used to treat mental illnesses. These medications are typically made of synthetic chemical compounds and are usually prescribed in psychiatric settings, potentially involuntarily during commitment. Since the mid-20th century, such medications have been leading treatments for a broad range of mental disorders and have decreased the need for long-term hospitalization, thereby lowering the cost of mental health care. The recidivism or rehospitalization of the mentally ill is at a high rate in many countries, and the reasons for the relapses are under research.

== History ==
Several significant psychiatric drugs were developed in the mid-20th century. In 1948, lithium was first used as a psychiatric medicine. One of the most important discoveries was chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic that was first given to a patient in 1952. In the same decade, Julius Axelrod carried out research into the interaction of neurotransmitters, which provided a foundation for the development of further drugs. The popularity of these drugs have increased significantly since then, with millions prescribed annually.

The introduction of these drugs brought profound changes to the treatment of mental illness. It meant that more patients could be treated without the need for confinement in a psychiatric hospital. It was one of the key reasons why many countries moved towards deinstitutionalization, closing many of these hospitals so that patients could be treated at home, in general hospitals and smaller facilities. Use of physical restraints such as straitjackets also declined.

As of 2013, the 10 most prescribed psychiatric drugs by number of prescriptions were alprazolam, sertraline, citalopram, fluoxetine, lorazepam, trazodone, escitalopram, duloxetine, bupropion XL, and venlafaxine XR.

== Administration ==
Psychiatric medications are prescription medications, requiring a prescription from a physician, such as a psychiatrist, or a psychiatric nurse practitioner, PMHNP, before they can be obtained. Some U.S. states and territories, following the creation of the prescriptive authority for psychologists movement, have granted prescriptive privileges to clinical psychologists who have undergone additional specialised education and training in medical psychology. In addition to the familiar dosage in pill form, psychiatric medications are evolving into more novel methods of drug delivery. New technologies include transdermal, transmucosal, inhalation, suppository or depot injection supplements.

== Research ==

Psychopharmacology studies a wide range of substances with various types of psychoactive properties. The professional and commercial fields of pharmacology and psychopharmacology do not typically focus on psychedelic or recreational drugs, and so the majority of studies are conducted on psychiatric medication. While studies are conducted on all psychoactive drugs by both fields, psychopharmacology focuses on psychoactive and chemical interactions within the brain. Physicians who research psychiatric medications are psychopharmacologists, specialists in the field of psychopharmacology.

== Adverse and withdrawal effects ==

Psychiatric disorders, including depression, psychosis, and bipolar disorder, are common and gaining more acceptance in the United States. The most commonly used classes of medications for these disorders are antidepressants, antipsychotics, and lithium. Unfortunately, these medications are associated with significant neurotoxicities.

Psychiatric medications carry risk for neurotoxic adverse effects. The occurrence of neurotoxic effects can potentially reduce drug compliance. Some adverse effects can be treated symptomatically by using adjunct medications such as anticholinergics (antimuscarinics). Some rebound or withdrawal adverse effects, such as the possibility of a sudden or severe emergence or re-emergence of psychosis in antipsychotic withdrawal, may appear when the drugs are discontinued, or discontinued too rapidly.

===Medicine combinations with clinically untried risks===
While clinical trials of psychiatric medications, like other medications, typically test medicines separately, there is a practice in psychiatry (more so than in somatic medicine) to use polypharmacy in combinations of medicines that have never been tested together in clinical trials (though all medicines involved have passed clinical trials separately). It is argued that this presents a risk of adverse effects, especially brain damage, in real-life mixed medication psychiatry that are not visible in the clinical trials of one medicine at a time (similar to mixed drug abuse causing significantly more damage than the additive effects of brain damages caused by using only one illegal drug). Outside clinical trials, there is evidence for an increase in mortality when psychiatric patients are transferred to polypharmacy with an increased number of medications being mixed.

==Types==

There are five main groups of psychiatric medications.
*Antidepressants, which treat disparate disorders such as clinical depression, dysthymia, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and borderline personality disorder.
*Antipsychotics, which treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms occurring in the context of other disorders such as mood disorders. They are also used for the treatment of bipolar disorder.
*Anxiolytics, which treat anxiety disorders, and include hypnotics and sedatives
*Mood stabilizers, which treat bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder.
*Stimulants, which treat disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy.

===Antidepressants===

Antidepressants are drugs used to treat clinical depression, and they are also often used for anxiety and other disorders. Most antidepressants will hinder the breakdown of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine. A commonly used class of antidepressants are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which act on serotonin transporters in the brain to increase levels of serotonin in the synaptic cleft. Another is the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which increase both serotonin and norepinephrine. Antidepressants will often take 3–5 weeks to have a noticeable effect as the regulation of receptors in the brain adapts. There are multiple classes of antidepressants which have different mechanisms of action. Another type of antidepressant is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), which is thought to block the action of monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that breaks down serotonin and norepinephrine. MAOIs are not used as first-line treatment due to the risk of hypertensive crisis related to the consumption of foods containing the amino acid tyramine.

Common antidepressants:
*Fluoxetine (Prozac), SSRI
*Paroxetine (Paxil, Seroxat), SSRI
*Citalopram (Celexa), SSRI
*Escitalopram (Lexapro), SSRI
*Sertraline (Zoloft), SSRI
*Duloxetine (Cymbalta), SNRI
*Venlafaxine (Effexor), SNRI
*Bupropion (Wellbutrin), NDRI
*Mirtazapine (Remeron), NaSSA
*Isocarboxazid (Marplan), MAOI
*Phenelzine (Nardil), MAOI
*Tranylcypromine (Parnate), MAOI
*Amitriptyline (Elavil), TCA

===Antipsychotics===

Antipsychotics are drugs used to treat various symptoms of psychosis, such as those caused by psychotic disorders or schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotics are also used as mood stabilizers in the treatment of bipolar disorder, and they can augment the action of antidepressants in major depressive disorder.
Antipsychotics are sometimes referred to as neuroleptic drugs and some antipsychotics are branded &quot;major tranquilizers&quot;.

There are two categories of antipsychotics: typical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics. Most antipsychotics are available only by prescription.

Common antipsychotics:
===Anxiolytics and hypnotics===
Benzodiazepines are effective as hypnotics, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, myorelaxants and amnesics. Having less proclivity for overdose and toxicity, they have widely supplanted barbiturates, although barbiturates (such as pentobarbital) are still used for euthanasia.

Developed in the 1950s onward, benzodiazepines were originally thought to be non-addictive at therapeutic doses, but are now known to cause withdrawal symptoms similar to barbiturates and alcohol. Benzodiazepines are generally recommended for short-term use.

Z-drugs are a group of drugs with effects generally similar to benzodiazepines, which are used in the treatment of insomnia.

Common benzodiazepines and z-drugs include:
===Mood stabilizers===

In 1949, the Australian John Cade discovered that lithium salts could control mania, reducing the frequency and severity of manic episodes. This introduced the now popular drug lithium carbonate to the mainstream public, as well as being the first mood stabilizer to be approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration. 
Besides lithium, several anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics have mood stabilizing activity. The mechanism of action of mood stabilizers is not well understood.

Common non-antipsychotic mood stabilizers include:
*Lithium (Lithobid, Eskalith), the oldest mood stabilizer
*Anticonvulsants
**Carbamazepine (Tegretol) and the related compound oxcarbazepine (Trileptal)
**Valproic acid, and salts (Depakene, Depakote)
**Lamotrigine (Lamictal)

===Stimulants===

A stimulant is a drug that stimulates the central nervous system, increasing arousal, attention and endurance. Stimulants are used in psychiatry to treat attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Because the medications can be addictive, patients with a history of drug abuse are typically monitored closely or treated with a non-stimulant.

Common stimulants:
*Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor
*Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin), the active dextro-enantiomer of methylphenidate
*Serdexmethylphenidate/dexmethylphenidate (Azstarys)
*Mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), a 3:1 mix of dextro/levo-enantiomers of amphetamine
*Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), the dextro-enantiomer of amphetamine 
*Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), a prodrug containing the dextro-enantiomer of amphetamine
*Methamphetamine (Desoxyn), a potent but infrequently prescribed amphetamine

== Controversies ==

Professionals, such as David Rosenhan, Peter Breggin, Paula Caplan, Thomas Szasz and Stuart A. Kirk sustain that psychiatry engages &quot;in the systematic medicalization of normality&quot;. More recently these concerns have come from insiders who have worked for and promoted the APA (e.g., Robert Spitzer, Allen Frances).

Scholars such as Cooper, Foucalt, Goffman, Deleuze and Szasz believe that pharmacological &quot;treatment&quot; is only a placebo effect, and that administration of drugs is just a religion in disguise and ritualistic chemistry. Other scholars have argued against psychiatric medication in that significant aspects of mental illness are related to the psyche or environmental factors, but medication works exclusively on a pharmacological basis.

Antipsychotics have been associated with decreases in brain volume over time, which may indicate a neurotoxic effect. However, untreated psychosis has also been associated with decreases in brain volume and treatments have been shown improve cognitive functioning.

<text>An aerosol is a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in air or another gas. Aerosols can be generated from natural or human causes. The term &quot;aerosol&quot; commonly refers to the mixture of particulates in air, and not to the particulate matter alone. Examples of natural aerosols are fog, mist or dust. Examples of human caused aerosols include particulate air pollutants, mist from the discharge at hydroelectric dams, irrigation mist, perfume from atomizers, smoke, dust, sprayed pesticides, and medical treatments for respiratory illnesses.

Several types of atmospheric aerosol have a significant effect on Earth&#x27;s climate: volcanic, desert dust, sea-salt, that originating from biogenic sources and human-made. Volcanic aerosol forms in the stratosphere after an eruption as droplets of sulfuric acid that can prevail for up to two years, and reflect sunlight, lowering temperature. Desert dust, mineral particles blown to high altitudes, absorb heat and may be responsible for inhibiting storm cloud formation. Human-made sulfate aerosols, primarily from burning oil and coal, affect the behavior of clouds. When aerosols absorb pollutants, it facilitates the deposition of pollutants to the surface of the earth as well as to bodies of water. This has the potential to be damaging to both the environment and human health.

Ship tracks are clouds that form around the exhaust released by ships into the still ocean air. Water molecules collect around the tiny particles (aerosols) from exhaust to form a cloud seed. More and more water accumulates on the seed until a visible cloud is formed. In the case of ship tracks, the cloud seeds are stretched over a long narrow path where the wind has blown the ship&#x27;s exhaust, so the resulting clouds resemble long strings over the ocean.

The warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases has been somewhat offset by the cooling effect of human-produced aerosols. In 2020, regulations on fuel significantly cut sulfur dioxide emissions from international shipping by approximately 80%, leading to an unexpected global geoengineering termination shock.

The liquid or solid particles in an aerosol have diameters typically less than 1 μm. Larger particles with a significant settling speed make the mixture a suspension, but the distinction is not clear. In everyday language, &quot;aerosol&quot; often refers to a dispensing system that delivers a consumer product from a spray can. 

Diseases can spread by means of small droplets in the breath, sometimes called bioaerosols.

== Definitions ==

Aerosol is defined as a suspension system of solid or liquid particles in a gas. An aerosol includes both the particles and the suspending gas, which is usually air. Meteorologists and climatologists often refer to them as particle matter, while the classification in sizes ranges like PM2.5 or PM10, is useful in the field of atmospheric pollution as these size range play a role in ascertain the harmful effects in human health. Frederick G. Donnan presumably first used the term &quot;aerosol&quot; during World War I to describe an aero-solution, clouds of microscopic particles in air. This term developed analogously to the term hydrosol, a colloid system with water as the dispersed medium. &quot;Primary aerosols&quot; contain particles introduced directly into the gas; &quot;secondary aerosols&quot; form through gas-to-particle conversion.

Key aerosol groups include sulfates, organic carbon, black carbon, nitrates, mineral dust, and sea salt, they usually clump together to form a complex mixture. Various types of aerosol, classified according to physical form and how they were generated, include dust, fume, mist, smoke and fog. 

There are several measures of aerosol concentration. Environmental science and environmental health often use the &quot;mass concentration&quot; (&quot;M&quot;), defined as the mass of particulate matter per unit volume, in units such as μg/m3. Also commonly used is the &quot;number concentration&quot; (&quot;N&quot;), the number of particles per unit volume, in units such as number per m3 or number per cm3.

Particle size has a major influence on particle properties, and the aerosol particle radius or diameter (&quot;dp&quot;) is a key property used to characterise aerosols.

Aerosols vary in their dispersity. A &quot;monodisperse&quot; aerosol, producible in the laboratory, contains particles of uniform size. Most aerosols, however, as &quot;polydisperse&quot; colloidal systems, exhibit a range of particle sizes. Liquid droplets are almost always nearly spherical, but scientists use an &quot;equivalent diameter&quot; to characterize the properties of various shapes of solid particles, some very irregular. The equivalent diameter is the diameter of a spherical particle with the same value of some physical property as the irregular particle. The &quot;equivalent volume diameter&quot; (&quot;de&quot;) is defined as the diameter of a sphere of the same volume as that of the irregular particle. Also commonly used is the aerodynamic diameter,  &quot;da&quot;.

== Generation and applications ==
People generate aerosols for various purposes, including:
* as test aerosols for calibrating instruments, performing research, and testing sampling equipment and air filters;
* to deliver deodorants, paints, and other consumer products in sprays;
* for dispersal and agricultural application
* for medical treatment of respiratory disease; and
* in fuel injection systems and other combustion technology.

Some devices for generating aerosols are:
* Aerosol spray
* Atomizer nozzle or nebulizer
* Electrospray
* Electronic cigarette
* Vibrating orifice aerosol generator (VOAG)

== In the atmosphere ==

Several types of atmospheric aerosol have a significant effect on Earth&#x27;s climate: volcanic, desert dust, sea-salt, that originating from biogenic sources and human-made. Volcanic aerosol forms in the stratosphere after an eruption as droplets of sulfuric acid that can prevail for up to two years, and reflect sunlight, lowering temperature. Desert dust, mineral particles blown to high altitudes, absorb heat and may be responsible for inhibiting storm cloud formation. Human-made sulfate aerosols, primarily from burning oil and coal, affect the behavior of clouds.

Although all hydrometeors, solid and liquid, can be described as aerosols, a distinction is commonly made between such dispersions (i.e. clouds) containing activated drops and crystals, and aerosol particles. The atmosphere of Earth contains aerosols of various types and concentrations, including quantities of:
* natural inorganic materials: fine dust, sea salt, or water droplets
* natural organic materials: smoke, pollen, spores, or bacteria
* anthropogenic products of combustion such as: smoke, ashes or dusts

Aerosols can be found in urban ecosystems in various forms, for example:
* Dust
* Cigarette smoke
* Mist from aerosol spray cans
* Soot or fumes in car exhaust

The presence of aerosols in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere can influence its climate, as well as human health.

=== Effects ===


Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of sulphuric acid, hydrogen sulfide and hydrochloric acid into the atmosphere. These gases represent aerosols and eventually return to earth as acid rain, having a number of adverse effects on the environment and human life.

When aerosols absorb pollutants, it facilitates the deposition of pollutants to the surface of the earth as well as to bodies of water. This has the potential to be damaging to both the environment and human health.

Aerosols interact with the Earth&#x27;s energy budget in two ways, directly and indirectly.
:* E.g., a &quot;direct&quot; effect is that aerosols scatter and absorb incoming solar radiation. This will mainly lead to a cooling of the surface (solar radiation is scattered back to space) but may also contribute to a warming of the surface (caused by the absorption of incoming solar energy). This will be an additional element to the greenhouse effect and therefore contributing to the global climate change.
:* The &quot;indirect&quot; effects refer to the aerosol interfering with formations that interact directly with radiation. For example, they are able to modify the size of the cloud particles in the lower atmosphere, thereby changing the way clouds reflect and absorb light and therefore modifying the Earth&#x27;s energy budget.
:* There is evidence to suggest that anthropogenic aerosols actually offset the effects of greenhouse gases in some areas, which is why the Northern Hemisphere shows slower surface warming than the Southern Hemisphere, although that just means that the Northern Hemisphere will absorb the heat later through ocean currents bringing warmer waters from the South. On a global scale however, aerosol cooling decreases greenhouse-gases-induced heating without offsetting it completely.
Ship tracks are clouds that form around the exhaust released by ships into the still ocean air. Water molecules collect around the tiny particles (aerosols) from exhaust to form a cloud seed. More and more water accumulates on the seed until a visible cloud is formed. In the case of ship tracks, the cloud seeds are stretched over a long narrow path where the wind has blown the ship&#x27;s exhaust, so the resulting clouds resemble long strings over the ocean. 

The warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases has been somewhat offset by the cooling effect of human-produced aerosols. In 2020, regulations on fuel significantly cut sulfur dioxide emissions from international shipping by approximately 80%, leading to an unexpected global geoengineering termination shock. 

Aerosols in the 20 μm range show a particularly long persistence time in air conditioned rooms due to their &quot;jet rider&quot; behaviour (move with air jets, gravitationally fall out in slowly moving air); as this aerosol size is most effectively adsorbed in the human nose, the primordial infection site in COVID-19, such aerosols may contribute to the pandemic.

Aerosol particles with an effective diameter smaller than 10 μm can enter the bronchi, while the ones with an effective diameter smaller than 2.5 μm can enter as far as the gas exchange region in the lungs, which can be hazardous to human health.

==Size distribution==
For a monodisperse aerosol, a single number—the particle diameter—suffices to describe the size of the particles. However, more complicated particle-size distributions describe the sizes of the particles in a polydisperse aerosol. This distribution defines the relative amounts of particles, sorted according to size. One approach to defining the particle size distribution uses a list of the sizes of every particle in a sample. However, this approach proves tedious to ascertain in aerosols with millions of particles and awkward to use. Another approach splits the size range into intervals and finds the number (or proportion) of particles in each interval. These data can be presented in a histogram with the area of each bar representing the proportion of particles in that size bin, usually normalised by dividing the number of particles in a bin by the width of the interval so that the area of each bar is proportionate to the number of particles in the size range that it represents. If the width of the bins tends to zero, the frequency function is:

:formula_1
where
:formula_2 is the diameter of the particles
:formula_3 is the fraction of particles having diameters between formula_4 and formula_4 + formula_6
:formula_7 is the frequency function

Therefore, the area under the frequency curve between two sizes a and &quot;b&quot; represents the total fraction of the particles in that size range:
:formula_8

It can also be formulated in terms of the total number density &quot;N&quot;:
:formula_9

Assuming spherical aerosol particles, the aerosol surface area per unit volume (&quot;S&quot;) is given by the second moment:
:formula_10

And the third moment gives the total volume concentration (&quot;V&quot;) of the particles:
:formula_11

The particle size distribution can be approximated. The normal distribution usually does not suitably describe particle size distributions in aerosols because of the skewness associated with a long tail of larger particles. Also for a quantity that varies over a large range, as many aerosol sizes do, the width of the distribution implies negative particles sizes, which is not physically realistic. However, the normal distribution can be suitable for some aerosols, such as test aerosols, certain pollen grains and spores.

A more widely chosen log-normal distribution gives the number frequency as:

:formula_12

where:

:formula_13 is the standard deviation of the size distribution and
:formula_14 is the arithmetic mean diameter.

The log-normal distribution has no negative values, can cover a wide range of values, and fits many observed size distributions reasonably well.

Other distributions sometimes used to characterise particle size include: the Rosin-Rammler distribution, applied to coarsely dispersed dusts and sprays; the Nukiyama–Tanasawa distribution, for sprays of extremely broad size ranges; the power function distribution, occasionally applied to atmospheric aerosols; the exponential distribution, applied to powdered materials; and for cloud droplets, the Khrgian–Mazin distribution.

== Physics ==
=== Terminal velocity of a particle in a fluid ===
For low values of the Reynolds number (&lt;1), true for most aerosol motion, Stokes&#x27; law describes the force of resistance on a solid spherical particle in a fluid. However, Stokes&#x27; law is only valid when the velocity of the gas at the surface of the particle is zero. For small particles (&lt; 1 μm) that characterize aerosols, however, this assumption fails. To account for this failure, one can introduce the Cunningham correction factor, always greater than 1. Including this factor, one finds the relation between the resisting force on a particle and its velocity:
:formula_15
where
:formula_16 is the resisting force on a spherical particle
:formula_17 is the dynamic viscosity of the gas
:formula_18 is the particle velocity
:formula_19 is the Cunningham correction factor.

This allows us to calculate the terminal velocity of a particle undergoing gravitational settling in still air. Neglecting buoyancy effects, we find:
:formula_20
where
:formula_21 is the terminal settling velocity of the particle.

The terminal velocity can also be derived for other kinds of forces. If Stokes&#x27; law holds, then the resistance to motion is directly proportional to speed. The constant of proportionality is the mechanical mobility (&quot;B&quot;) of a particle:

:formula_22

A particle traveling at any reasonable initial velocity approaches its terminal velocity exponentially with an &quot;e&quot;-folding time equal to the relaxation time:

:formula_23

where:
:formula_24 is the particle speed at time t
:formula_25 is the final particle speed
:formula_26 is the initial particle speed

To account for the effect of the shape of non-spherical particles, a correction factor known as the &quot;dynamic shape factor&quot; is applied to Stokes&#x27; law. It is defined as the ratio of the resistive force of the irregular particle to that of a spherical particle with the same volume and velocity:

:formula_27

where:
:formula_28 is the dynamic shape factor

=== Aerodynamic diameter ===
The aerodynamic diameter of an irregular particle is defined as the diameter of the spherical particle with a density of 1000 kg/m3 and the same settling velocity as the irregular particle.

Neglecting the slip correction, the particle settles at the terminal velocity proportional to the square of the aerodynamic diameter, &quot;da&quot;:

:formula_29

where
:formula_30 = standard particle density (1000 kg/m3).

This equation gives the aerodynamic diameter:
:formula_31

One can apply the aerodynamic diameter to particulate pollutants or to inhaled drugs to predict where in the respiratory tract such particles deposit. Pharmaceutical companies typically use aerodynamic diameter, not geometric diameter, to characterize particles in inhalable drugs. 

=== Dynamics ===
The previous discussion focused on single aerosol particles. In contrast, &quot;aerosol dynamics&quot; explains the evolution of complete aerosol populations. The concentrations of particles will change over time as a result of many processes. External processes that move particles outside a volume of gas under study include diffusion, gravitational settling, and electric charges and other external forces that cause particle migration. A second set of processes internal to a given volume of gas include particle formation (nucleation), evaporation, chemical reaction, and coagulation.

A differential equation called the &quot;Aerosol General Dynamic Equation&quot; (GDE) characterizes the evolution of the number density of particles in an aerosol due to these processes.

: formula_32

Change in time = Convective transport + brownian diffusion + gas-particle interactions + coagulation + migration by external forces

Where:
:formula_33 is number density of particles of size category formula_34
:formula_35 is the particle velocity
:formula_36 is the particle Stokes-Einstein diffusivity
:formula_37 is the particle velocity associated with an external force

==== Coagulation ====

As particles and droplets in an aerosol collide with one another, they may undergo coalescence or aggregation. This process leads to a change in the aerosol particle-size distribution, with the mode increasing in diameter as total number of particles decreases. On occasion, particles may shatter apart into numerous smaller particles; however, this process usually occurs primarily in particles too large for consideration as aerosols.

====Dynamics regimes====
The Knudsen number of the particle define three different dynamical regimes that govern the behaviour of an aerosol:

:formula_38

where formula_39 is the mean free path of the suspending gas and formula_40 is the diameter of the particle. For particles in the &quot;free molecular regime&quot;, &quot;Kn&quot; » 1; particles small compared to the mean free path of the suspending gas. In this regime, particles interact with the suspending gas through a series of &quot;ballistic&quot; collisions with gas molecules. As such, they behave similarly to gas molecules, tending to follow streamlines and diffusing rapidly through Brownian motion. The mass flux equation in the free molecular regime is:

:formula_41

where &quot;a&quot; is the particle radius, &quot;P&quot;∞ and &quot;PA&quot; are the pressures far from the droplet and at the surface of the droplet respectively, &quot;kb&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, &quot;T&quot; is the temperature, &quot;CA&quot; is mean thermal velocity and &quot;α&quot; is mass accommodation coefficient. The derivation of this equation assumes constant pressure and constant diffusion coefficient.

Particles are in the &quot;continuum regime&quot; when Kn « 1. In this regime, the particles are big compared to the mean free path of the suspending gas, meaning that the suspending gas acts as a continuous fluid flowing round the particle. The molecular flux in this regime is:

:formula_42

where &quot;a&quot; is the radius of the particle &quot;A&quot;, &quot;MA&quot; is the molecular mass of the particle &quot;A&quot;, &quot;DAB&quot; is the diffusion coefficient between particles &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, &quot;R&quot; is the ideal gas constant, &quot;T&quot; is the temperature (in absolute units like kelvin), and &quot;PA∞&quot; and &quot;PAS&quot; are the pressures at infinite and at the surface respectively.

The &quot;transition regime&quot; contains all the particles in between the free molecular and continuum regimes or &quot;Kn&quot; ≈ 1. The forces experienced by a particle are a complex combination of interactions with individual gas molecules and macroscopic interactions. The semi-empirical equation describing mass flux is:

:formula_43

where &quot;I&quot;cont is the mass flux in the continuum regime. This formula is called the Fuchs-Sutugin interpolation formula. These equations do not take into account the heat release effect.

==== Partitioning ====

Aerosol partitioning theory governs condensation on and evaporation from an aerosol surface, respectively. Condensation of mass causes the mode of the particle-size distributions of the aerosol to increase; conversely, evaporation causes the mode to decrease. Nucleation is the process of forming aerosol mass from the condensation of a gaseous precursor, specifically a vapor. Net condensation of the vapor requires supersaturation, a partial pressure greater than its vapor pressure. This can happen for three reasons:
# Lowering the temperature of the system lowers the vapor pressure.
# Chemical reactions may increase the partial pressure of a gas or lower its vapor pressure.
# The addition of additional vapor to the system may lower the equilibrium vapor pressure according to Raoult&#x27;s law.

There are two types of nucleation processes. Gases preferentially condense onto surfaces of pre-existing aerosol particles, known as heterogeneous nucleation. This process causes the diameter at the mode of particle-size distribution to increase with constant number concentration. With sufficiently high supersaturation and no suitable surfaces, particles may condense in the absence of a pre-existing surface, known as homogeneous nucleation. This results in the addition of very small, rapidly growing particles to the particle-size distribution.

====Activation====
Water coats particles in aerosols, making them &quot;activated&quot;, usually in the context of forming a cloud droplet (such as natural cloud seeding by aerosols from trees in a forest). Following the Kelvin equation (based on the curvature of liquid droplets), smaller particles need a higher ambient relative humidity to maintain equilibrium than larger particles do. The following formula gives relative humidity at equilibrium:

:formula_44

where formula_45 is the saturation vapor pressure above a particle at equilibrium (around a curved liquid droplet), &quot;p&quot;0 is the saturation vapor pressure (flat surface of the same liquid) and &quot;S&quot; is the saturation ratio.

Kelvin equation for saturation vapor pressure above a curved surface is:

:formula_46

where &quot;rp&quot; droplet radius, &quot;σ&quot; surface tension of droplet, &quot;ρ&quot; density of liquid, &quot;M&quot; molar mass, &quot;T&quot; temperature, and &quot;R&quot; molar gas constant.

==== Solution to the general dynamic equation ====
There are no general solutions to the general dynamic equation (GDE); common methods used to solve the general dynamic equation include:
* Moment method
* Modal/sectional method, and
* Quadrature method of moments/Taylor-series expansion method of moments, and
* Monte Carlo method.

== Detection ==
Aerosols can either be measured in-situ or with remote sensing techniques either ground-based on airborne-based.

=== &quot;In situ&quot; observations ===
Some available in situ measurement techniques include:
* Aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS)
* Differential mobility analyzer (DMA)
* Electrical aerosol spectrometer (EAS)
* Aerodynamic particle sizer (APS)
* Aerodynamic aerosol classifier (AAC)
* Wide range particle spectrometer (WPS)
* Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor(MOUDI)
* Condensation particle counter (CPC)
* Epiphaniometer
* Electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI)
* Aerosol particle mass-analyser (APM)
* Centrifugal Particle Mass Analyser (CPMA)

=== Remote sensing approach ===
Remote sensing approaches include:
* Sun photometer
* Lidar
* Imaging spectroscopy

=== Size selective sampling ===
Particles can deposit in the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx (the head airways region), deeper within the respiratory tract (from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles), or in the alveolar region. The location of deposition of aerosol particles within the respiratory system strongly determines the health effects of exposure to such aerosols. This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system. 

Examples of these subsets of the particle-size distribution of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway. The inhalable fraction of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle-size distribution by aerodynamic diameter. The thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region. The respirable fraction is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region. To measure the respirable fraction of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, horizontal elutriators, and large pore membrane filters.

Two alternative size-selective criteria, often used in atmospheric monitoring, are PM10 and PM2.5. PM10 is defined by ISO as &quot;particles which pass through a size-selective inlet with a 50% efficiency cut-off at 10 μm aerodynamic diameter&quot; and PM2.5 as &quot;particles which pass through a size-selective inlet with a 50% efficiency cut-off at 2.5 μm aerodynamic diameter&quot;. PM10 corresponds to the &quot;thoracic convention&quot; as defined in ISO 7708:1995, Clause 6; PM2.5 corresponds to the &quot;high-risk respirable convention&quot; as defined in ISO 7708:1995, 7.1. The United States Environmental Protection Agency replaced the older standards for particulate matter based on Total Suspended Particulate with another standard based on PM10 in 1987 and then introduced standards for PM2.5 (also known as fine particulate matter) in 1997.

<doc id="57764" wikidata="Q6841389" url="?curid=57764" title="Middle English creole hypothesis">
<text>The Middle English creole hypothesis is a proposal that Middle English was a creole, which is usually defined as a language that develops during contact between two groups speaking different languages and that loses much of the grammatical elaboration of its source languages in the process. The vast differences between Old English and Middle English, and English&#x27;s status as one of the least structurally elaborated of the Germanic languages, have led some historical linguists to argue that the language underwent creolisation at around the 11th century, shortly after the Norman conquest of England. Other linguists suggest that creolisation began earlier, during the Scandinavian incursions of the 9th and 10th centuries.

Much of the debate over the Middle English creole hypothesis revolves around how terms like &quot;creole&quot; or &quot;creolisation&quot; should be defined. While there does not exist a consensus that Middle English should be classified as a creole, there does exist a consensus that Old English underwent fairly radical grammatical simplification in the process of evolving into Middle English, and that this evolution was due in large part to contact with speakers from other language groups.

==Middle English as a French creole==
This hypothesis was first proposed by C.-J. Bailey and K. Maroldt in 1977, followed by Nicole Domingue and Patricia Poussa. These authors argued that Middle English was a creole that developed when the Norman French-speaking invaders learned Old English imperfectly and expanded their reduced English into a full language. Evidence cited in support of the hypothesis was the heavy admixture of French words into the English lexicon, including some basic words such as the words for uncle, niece, danger, trouble, cause; the frequent loss of Old English verb and adjective affixes in favor of loans from the French (e.g. &quot;enclosid&quot;, &quot;inpacient&quot;, &quot;disheritance&quot;); a number of grammatical changes that appear to have been modeled after the French, such as expression of the perfect aspect using the verb &quot;have&quot; (as in &quot;she has eaten&quot;), the use of &quot;of&quot; to express the genitive (as in French ), and constructions such as &quot;it is me&quot;, &quot;it is him&quot; (compare modern French , ); and English&#x27;s complete loss of case and gender markers on nouns.

==Defining &quot;creole&quot; and &quot;creolisation&quot;==

Linguists&#x27; conception of what constitutes a creole has changed substantially in the years since Bailey &amp; Maroldt&#x27;s original proposal, and the question of whether Middle English is a French creole depends to some extent on how one defines the term &quot;creole&quot;.

Broadly speaking, two definitions of creole and creolisation are current in the linguistic literature:

Middle English comes reasonably close to satisfying the three criteria that define McWhorter&#x27;s creole prototype. For instance, by the end of the twelfth century, grammatical gender was all but lost in northern English dialects, and two centuries later it had disappeared even in the south. However Middle English did not lose all of Old English&#x27;s noncompositional derivational morphology; for instance, Old English &quot;understandan&quot; → Middle English &quot;understanden&quot; → English &quot;understand&quot;. Nevertheless, Middle English is highly simplified compared with Old English, suggesting, according to McWhorter, a contact-based explanation, though not necessarily contact with French:

==Scandinavian influence==

While they emphasised the influence of French, both Bailey &amp; Maroldt and Poussa also discussed the possibility that it was contact between Old English speakers and the invading Vikings during the ninth and tenth centuries, that was responsible for much of the loss of Germanic inheritance, followed only later by a Norman French influence. According to this scenario, Middle English would be more appropriately described as an Old Norse creole rather than a Norman French creole.

A number of arguments have been advanced in support of the hypothesis that Scandinavian contact profoundly influenced the course of English&#x27;s evolution prior to the Norman invasion:

*Unlike the French elites, Scandinavians settled among the general population and often married Anglo-Saxon women.
*Lexical borrowing from Old Norse, while not as extensive as later borrowings from Norman French, included many &quot;domestic&quot; content words (happy, knife, skirt, window, neck) as well as commonly-used words such as they, their, them, though, both, same, against.
*Loss of grammatical gender in English appears to have occurred first in the north and east, the regions of greatest Scandinavian settlement. Remnants of gender distinctions in English persisted longest in the Viking-free southwest – as late as the nineteenth century in the case of the Dorset dialect.
*The rapid loss of Old English verbal prefixes is attributed to the fact that Old Norse had already lost most of the Germanic prefixes, and so lacked cognates for English prefixed verbs.

McWhorter, in summarizing the evidence for Scandinavian influence, writes that &quot;the evidence strongly suggests that extensive second-language acquisition by Scandinavians from the eighth century onwards simplified English grammar to a considerable extent&quot;. More specifically, the claim is that the inflectional and other losses in English resulted from Old Norse speakers&#x27; incomplete acquisition of English.

Creolisation of English might have occurred due to interaction between Common Brittonic and English, however evidence supporting the influence of the Celtic languages on English is hampered by a lack of written sources.

==Middle English as a semi-creole==

A number of linguists, e.g. John Holm, have argued that creolisation occurs along a cline, that is, that a language can be creolised to various degrees. Even if Middle English does not fully satisfy the criteria that would make it a creole, it has been argued that it might still be characterisable as a &quot;semi-creole&quot;. A semi-creole is defined as a language that harbors symptoms of a break in transmission due to large-scale adult acquisition, without those symptoms being extreme enough to put it in the creole class. Such languages are often thought of as dialects of the lexifier language rather than as different languages. Recognized examples of semi-creoles include Afrikaans (Dutch as morphologically streamlined by contact with Khoisan), Reunionnais French, Lingala, and Shaba Swahili. McWhorter argues that English is even more extreme than Afrikaans in having shed much of its Germanic content, and therefore that the case for describing English as a semi-creole is even stronger than for Afrikaans.

<text>The Battle of the Atlantic, the longest continuous military campaign in World War II, ran from 1939 to the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, covering a major part of the naval history of World War II. At its core was the Allied naval blockade of Germany, announced the day after the declaration of war, and Germany&#x27;s subsequent counter-blockade. The campaign peaked from mid-1940 to the end of 1943.

The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the German (Navy) and aircraft of the (Air Force) against the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, United States Navy, and Allied merchant shipping. Convoys, coming mainly from North America and predominantly going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces. These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States beginning on 13 September 1941. The Germans were joined by submarines of the Italian (Royal Navy) after Germany&#x27;s Axis ally Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940.

As an island country, the United Kingdom was highly dependent on imported goods. Britain required more than a million tons of imported material per week in order to survive and fight. The Battle of the Atlantic involved a tonnage war; the Allied struggle to supply Britain, and the Axis attempt to stem the flow of merchant shipping that enabled Britain to keep fighting. Rationing in the United Kingdom was also used with the aim of reducing demand, by reducing wastage and increasing domestic production and equality of distribution. From 1942 onwards, the Axis also sought to prevent the build-up of Allied supplies and equipment in the UK in preparation for the invasion of occupied Europe. The defeat of the U-boat threat was a prerequisite for pushing back the Axis in Western Europe. The outcome of the battle was a strategic victory for the Allies—the German tonnage war failed—but at great cost: 3,500 merchant ships and 175 warships were sunk in the Atlantic for the loss of 783 U-boats and 47 German surface warships, including 4 battleships (, , , and ), 9 cruisers, 7 raiders, and 27 destroyers. This front was a main consumer of the German war effort: Germany spent more money to produce naval vessels than every type of ground vehicle combined, including tanks.

Although the GRT (gross registered tonnage) was used by all engaged in the “tonnage war,” the values, recorded as GRT or sometimes as “tons,” should not be confused with the weight of the cargo a ship might have carried. The unit of GRT is a volume, 100 cubic feet per “ton,” but is not a weight. A ton of water, for example, has a volume of 32 cubic feet. A load of 2,125 tons of water would have occupied 1,000 &quot;tons&quot; of a ship’s total GRT (100,000 cubic feet). During the Second World War the term GRT included almost all of the enclosed space. In addition, the Germans attributed GRTs sunk to ships with or without cargo aboard, to passenger and troop ships, and to warships. Thus, measurements of GRT sunk each month had no relationship to shipments and was not limited to merchant freighters. 
The Battle of the Atlantic has been called the &quot;longest, largest, and most complex&quot; naval battle in history. The campaign started immediately after the European war began, during the so-called &quot;Phoney War&quot;, and lasted more than five years, until the German surrender in May 1945. It involved thousands of ships in a theatre covering millions of square miles of ocean. The situation changed constantly, with one side or the other gaining advantage, as participating countries surrendered, joined and even changed sides in the war, and as new weapons, tactics, counter-measures and equipment were developed by both sides. The Allies gradually gained the upper hand, overcoming German surface-raiders by the end of 1942 and defeating the U-boats by mid-1943, though losses due to U-boats continued until the war&#x27;s end. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later wrote, &quot;The only thing that really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril. I was even more anxious about this battle than I had been about the glorious air fight called the &#x27;Battle of Britain&#x27;.&quot;

==Name==
On 5 March 1941, the First Lord of the Admiralty, A. V. Alexander, asked Parliament for &quot;many more ships and great numbers of men&quot; to fight &quot;the Battle of the Atlantic&quot;, which he compared to the Battle of France, fought the previous summer. The first meeting of the Cabinet&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Atlantic Committee&quot; was on 19 March. Churchill claimed to have coined the phrase &quot;Battle of the Atlantic&quot; shortly before Alexander&#x27;s speech, but there are several examples of earlier usage.

==Background==
Following the use of unrestricted submarine warfare by Germany in the First World War, countries tried to limit or abolish submarines. The effort failed. Instead, the London Naval Treaty required submarines to abide by &quot;cruiser rules&quot;, which demanded they surface, search and place ship crews in &quot;a place of safety&quot; (for which lifeboats did not qualify, except under particular circumstances) before sinking them, unless the ship in question showed &quot;persistent refusal to stop...or active resistance to visit or search&quot;. These regulations did not prohibit arming merchantmen, but doing so, or having them report contact with submarines (or raiders), made them &quot;de facto&quot; naval auxiliaries and removed the protection of the cruiser rules.

The Treaty of Versailles forbade the Germans to operate U-boats and reduced the German surface fleet to a few obsolete ships. When three of these obsolete ships had to be replaced, the Germans opted to construct the Deutschland-class of (armoured ships) or &quot;pocket battleships&quot; as they were nicknamed by foreign navies. These ships were designed for commerce raiding on distant seas, to operate as a raider hunting for independently sailing ships, and to avoid combat with superior forces.

The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 allowed Hitler to renounce the treaty of Versailles, and to build a fleet 35% the size of Britain&#x27;s fleet. A building programme for four battleships, two aircraft carriers, five heavy cruisers, destroyers and U-boats was immediately initiated. With the agreement, Hitler thought that conflict with the UK was very unlikely and hence the fleet was designed for commerce raiding against the French rather than to try to challenge command of the sea. The commander of the German U-boats, Karl Dönitz, had his own opinions. In contrast with Hitler and Erich Raeder, the chief of the German Navy, he judged that war with the UK was inevitable and that a large surface fleet was not needed, but that U-boats could defeat the British. According to his calculations, a fleet of 300 medium Type VII U-boats could sink a million tons of ships a month and within a year sink enough of the about 3,000 British merchant ships (comprising 17.5 million tons) to strangle the British economy. In the First World War, U-boats had been defeated mainly by the convoy system, but Dönitz thought this could be overcome with the : a patrol line of U-boats searched for a convoy and when one was found all U-boats converged and attacked together at night on the surface. Neither aircraft nor early forms of sonar, (called ASDIC by the British), were considered a serious threat at the time. ASDIC could not detect a surfaced submarine and its range was less than that of an electric torpedo, aircraft could not operate at night and, during the day, an alert U-boat could dive before the aircraft attacked. Dönitz could not convince Raeder of his ideas, so each time the U-boat fleet was expanded, Raeder opted to build a mixture of coastal, medium and large submarines, even minelayers and U-cruisers. Even when in 1938 Hitler realised he would sooner or later have to oppose the UK and launched his Plan Z, only a minority of the planned 239 U-boats were medium U-boats.

==Anti-submarine warfare==
With the introduction of ASDIC, the British Admiralty believed to have effectively neutralised the submarine threat. Hence the number of destroyers and convoy escorts was reduced and the anti-submarine branch was seen as third rate. Destroyers were also equipped with ASDIC, but it was expected that these ships would be used in fleet actions rather than anti-submarine warfare, so they were not extensively trained in their use. Trials with ASDIC were usually conducted in ideal conditions and the British Admiralty failed to appreciate the limitations of ASDIC: range was limited, ASDIC worked only well if the speed of the operating vessel was below eight knots, ASDIC was hampered by rough weather and it took a very skilled operator to distinguish echoes from thermoclines, whales, shoals of fish and wrecks. Also, early versions could not look directly down, so contact was lost during the final stages of a depth charge attack. The basic set could detect range and bearing, but target depth could only be estimated from the range at which contact was lost.

An escort swept its ASDIC beam in an arc from one side of its course to the other, stopping the transducer every few degrees to send out a signal. On detection of a submarine, the escort would close in at moderate speed and increase its speed to attack. The intention was to pass over the submarine, rolling depth charges from chutes at the stern, while throwers fired further charges to either side, laying a pattern of depth charges. To disable a submarine, a depth charge had to explode within about . Since early ASDIC equipment was poor at determining depth, it was usual to vary the depth settings on part of the pattern.

When in early 1939 the threat of war became more clear it was realised that Britain could not rely on the London Naval Treaty that outlawed unrestricted submarine warfare. The organisational infrastructure for convoys had been maintained since World War I, with a thorough and systematic upgrade in the second half of the 1930s, but not enough escorts were available for convoy escorting, and a crash programme for building Tree-class trawlers, Flower-class corvettes and Hunt-class destroyers was initiated. Merchant ships that were either too fast or too slow for convoys, were to be equipped with a self-defence gun against surfaced submarine attacks, thus forcing an attacking U-boat to spend its precious torpedoes. This removed these ships from the protection of the cruiser rules under the prize law.

Despite this lack of readiness, in 1939 the Royal Navy probably had as many ASDIC equipped warships in service as all the other navies of the world combined.

Similarly the role of aircraft had been neglected; the Royal Air Force had organised a Coastal Command to support the Royal Navy, but it possessed insufficient aircraft, had no long range aircraft nor were aircraft crew trained in anti-submarine warfare. The only weapon against submarines was inadequate bombs. Finally, it was not forgotten that in World War I, mines had sunk more U-boats than any other weapon. Plans were drafted for mine fields in the Channel and along the east coast in defence of shipping lanes, and also offensive mine barrages on the German U-boat lanes towards the Atlantic Ocean.

==Early skirmishes (September 1939 – May 1940)==

In 1939, the lacked the strength to challenge the combined British Royal Navy and French Navy () for command of the sea. Instead, German naval strategy relied on commerce raiding using capital ships, armed merchant cruisers, submarines and aircraft. Many German warships were already at sea when war was declared in September 1939, including most of the available U-boats and the &quot;pocket battleships&quot; and which had sortied into the Atlantic in August. These ships immediately attacked British and French shipping. sank the ocean liner within hours of the declaration of war—in breach of her orders not to sink passenger ships. The U-boat fleet, which was to dominate so much of the Battle of the Atlantic, was small at the beginning of the war; many of the 57 available U-boats were the small and short-range Type IIs, useful primarily for minelaying and operations in British coastal waters. Much of the early German anti-shipping activity involved minelaying by destroyers, aircraft and U-boats off British ports.

With the outbreak of war, the British and French immediately began a blockade of Germany, although this had little immediate effect on German industry. The Royal Navy quickly introduced a convoy system for the protection of trade that gradually extended out from the British Isles, eventually reaching as far as Panama, Bombay and Singapore. Convoys allowed the Royal Navy to concentrate its escorts near the one place the U-boats were guaranteed to be found, the convoys. Each convoy consisted of between 30 and 70 mostly unarmed merchant ships.

Some British naval officials, particularly the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, sought a more &#x27;offensive&#x27; strategy. The Royal Navy formed anti-submarine hunting groups based on aircraft carriers to patrol the shipping lanes in the Western Approaches and hunt for German U-boats. This strategy was deeply flawed because a U-boat, with its tiny silhouette, was always likely to spot the surface warships and submerge long before it was sighted. The carrier aircraft were little help; although they could spot submarines on the surface, at this stage of the war they had no adequate weapons to attack them, and any submarine found by an aircraft was long gone by the time surface warships arrived. The hunting group strategy proved a disaster within days. On 14 September 1939, Britain&#x27;s most modern carrier, , narrowly avoided being sunk when three torpedoes from exploded prematurely. &quot;U-39&quot; was forced to surface and scuttle by the escorting destroyers, becoming the first U-boat loss of the war. Another carrier, , was sunk three days later by .

German success in sinking &quot;Courageous&quot; was surpassed a month later when Günther Prien in penetrated the British base at Scapa Flow and sank the old battleship at anchor, immediately becoming a hero in Germany.

In the South Atlantic, British forces were stretched by the cruise of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, which sank nine merchant ships of in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean during the first three months of war. The British and French formed hunting groups including three battlecruisers, three aircraft carriers, and 15 cruisers to seek the raider and her sister &quot;Deutschland&quot;, which was operating in the North Atlantic. These hunting groups had no success until &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was caught off the mouth of the River Plate between Argentina and Uruguay by an inferior British force. After suffering damage in the subsequent action, she took shelter in neutral Montevideo harbour and was scuttled on 17 December 1939.

After this initial burst of activity, the Atlantic campaign quietened down. Admiral Karl Dönitz, commander of the U-boat fleet, had planned a maximum submarine effort for the first month of the war, with almost all the available U-boats out on patrol in September. That level of deployment could not be sustained; the boats needed to return to harbour to refuel, re-arm, re-stock supplies, and refit. The harsh winter of 1939–40, which froze over many of the Baltic ports, seriously hampered the German offensive by trapping several new U-boats in the ice. Hitler&#x27;s plans to invade Norway and Denmark in early 1940 led to the withdrawal of the fleet&#x27;s surface warships and most of the ocean-going U-boats for fleet operations in Operation Weserübung.

The resulting Norwegian campaign revealed serious flaws in the German U-boat torpedoes: both the impact pistol and the magnetic influence pistol (detonation mechanism) were defective, and the torpedoes did not run at the proper depth, often undershooting targets. Only one British warship was sunk by U-boats in more than 38 attacks. As the news spread through the U-boat fleet, it began to undermine morale. Since the effectiveness of the magnetic pistol was already reduced by the degaussing of Allied ships, Dönitz decided to use new contact pistols, which were copied from British torpedoes found in the captured British submarine . The depth setting mechanism was improved but only in January 1942 were the last complications with that mechanism discovered and fixed, making the torpedo more reliable.

==British situation==
The German occupation of Norway in April 1940, the rapid conquest of the Low Countries and France in May and June, and the Italian entry into the war on the Axis side in June transformed the war at sea in general and the Atlantic campaign in particular in three main ways:
* Britain lost its biggest ally. In 1940, the French Navy was the fourth largest in the world. Only a handful of French ships joined the Free French Forces and fought against Germany, though these were later joined by a few Canadian destroyers. With the French fleet removed from the campaign, the Royal Navy was stretched even further. Italy&#x27;s declaration of war meant that Britain also had to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet and establish a new group at Gibraltar, known as Force H, to replace the French fleet in the Western Mediterranean.
* The U-boats gained direct access to the Atlantic. Since the English Channel was relatively shallow, and was partially blocked with minefields by mid-1940, U-boats were ordered not to negotiate it and instead travel around the British Isles to reach the most profitable spot to hunt ships. The German bases in France at Brest, Lorient, and La Pallice (near La Rochelle), were about closer to the Atlantic than the bases on the North Sea. This greatly improved the situation for U-boats in the Atlantic, enabling them to attack convoys further west and letting them spend longer on patrol, doubling the effective size of the U-boat force. The Germans later built huge fortified concrete submarine pens for the U-boats in the French Atlantic bases, which were impervious to Allied bombing until mid-1944 when the Tallboy bomb became available. From early July, U-boats returned to the new French bases when they had completed their Atlantic patrols, with docking at Lorient as the first arrival.
* British destroyers were diverted from the Atlantic. The Norwegian campaign and the German invasion of the Low Countries and France imposed a heavy strain on the Royal Navy&#x27;s destroyer flotillas. Many older destroyers were withdrawn from convoy routes to support the Norwegian campaign in April and May and then diverted to the English Channel to support the withdrawal from Dunkirk. By mid-1940, Britain faced a serious threat of invasion. Many destroyers were held in the Channel, ready to repel a German invasion. They suffered heavily under air attack by the . Seven destroyers were lost in the Norwegian campaign, another six in the Battle of Dunkirk and a further 10 in the Channel and North Sea between May and July, many to air attack because they lacked an adequate anti-aircraft armament. Dozens of others were damaged.

The completion of Hitler&#x27;s campaign in Western Europe meant U-boats withdrawn from the Atlantic for the Norwegian campaign now returned to the war on trade. So at the very time the number of U-boats on patrol in the Atlantic began to increase, the number of escorts available for the convoys was greatly reduced. The only consolation for the British was that the large merchant fleets of occupied countries like Norway and the Netherlands came under British control. After the German occupation of Denmark and Norway, Britain occupied Iceland and the Faroe Islands, establishing bases there and preventing a German takeover.

It was in these circumstances that Winston Churchill, who had become Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, first wrote to President Franklin Roosevelt to request the loan of fifty obsolescent US Navy destroyers. This eventually led to the &quot;Destroyers for Bases Agreement&quot; (effectively a sale but portrayed as a loan for political reasons), which operated in exchange for 99-year leases on certain British bases in Newfoundland, Bermuda and the West Indies, a financially advantageous bargain for the United States but militarily beneficial for Britain, since it effectively freed up British military assets to return to Europe. A significant percentage of the US population opposed entering the war, and some American politicians (including the US Ambassador to Britain, Joseph P. Kennedy) believed that Britain and its allies might lose. The first of these destroyers were only taken over by their British and Canadian crews in September, and all needed to be rearmed and fitted with ASDIC. It was to be many months before these ships contributed to the campaign.

== &#x27;The Happy Time&#x27; (June 1940 – February 1941) ==
The early U-boat operations from the French bases were spectacularly successful. This was the heyday of the great U-boat aces like Günther Prien of &quot;U-47&quot;, Otto Kretschmer (), Joachim Schepke (), Engelbert Endrass (), Victor Oehrn () and Heinrich Bleichrodt (). U-boat crews became heroes in Germany. From June until October 1940, over 270 Allied ships were sunk; this period was referred to by U-boat crews as &quot;the Happy Time&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Churchill would later write: &quot;...the only thing that ever frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril&quot;.

The biggest challenge for the U-boats was to find the convoys in the vastness of the ocean. The Germans had a handful of very long-range Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor aircraft based at Bordeaux and Stavanger, which were used for reconnaissance. The Condor was a converted civilian airliner—a stop-gap solution for . Due to ongoing friction between the and , the primary source of convoy sightings was the U-boats themselves. Since a submarine&#x27;s bridge was very close to the water, their range of visual detection was short.

The best source proved to be the codebreakers of who had succeeded in deciphering the British Naval Cypher No. 3, allowing the Germans to estimate where and when convoys could be expected.

In response, the British applied the techniques of operations research to the problem and came up with some counter-intuitive solutions for protecting convoys. They realised that the area of a convoy increased by the square of its perimeter, meaning the same number of ships, using the same number of escorts, was better protected in one convoy than in two. A large convoy was as difficult to locate as a small one. Reduced frequency also reduced the chances of detection, as fewer large convoys could carry the same amount of cargo, while large convoys take longer to assemble. Therefore, a few large convoys with apparently few escorts were safer than many small convoys with a higher ratio of escorts to merchantmen.

Instead of attacking the Allied convoys singly, U-boats were directed to work in wolf packs () coordinated by radio. The boats spread out into a long patrol line that bisected the path of the Allied convoy routes. Once in position, the crew studied the horizon through binoculars looking for masts or smoke, or used hydrophones to pick up propeller noises. When one boat sighted a convoy, it would report the sighting to U-boat headquarters, shadowing and continuing to report as needed until other boats arrived, typically at night. Instead of being faced by single submarines, the convoy escorts then had to cope with groups of up to half a dozen U-boats attacking simultaneously. The most daring commanders, such as Kretschmer, penetrated the escort screen and attacked from within the columns of merchantmen. The escort vessels, which were too few in number and often lacking in endurance, had no answer to multiple submarines attacking on the surface at night, as their ASDIC worked well only against underwater targets. Early British marine radar, working in the metric bands, lacked target discrimination and range. Corvettes were too slow to catch a surfaced U-boat.

Pack tactics were first used successfully in September and October 1940 to devastating effect, in a series of convoy battles. On 21 September, convoy HX 72 of 42 merchantmen was attacked by a pack of four U-boats, which sank eleven ships and damaged two over the course of two nights. In October, the slow convoy SC 7, with an escort of two sloops and two corvettes, was overwhelmed, losing 59% of its ships. The battle for HX 79 in the following days was in many ways worse for the escorts than for SC 7. The loss of a quarter of the convoy without any loss to the U-boats, despite a very strong escort (two destroyers, four corvettes, three trawlers, and a minesweeper) demonstrated the effectiveness of the German tactics against the inadequate British anti-submarine methods. On 1 December, seven German and three Italian submarines caught HX 90, sinking 10 ships and damaging three others.

At the end of 1940, the Admiralty viewed the number of ships sunk with growing alarm. Damaged ships might survive but could be out of commission for long periods. Two million gross tons of merchant shipping—13% of the fleet available to the British—were under repair and unavailable, which had the same effect in slowing down cross-Atlantic supplies.

Nor were the U-boats the only threat. Following some early experience in support of the war at sea during Operation Weserübung, the began to take a toll of merchant ships. Martin Harlinghausen and his recently established command——contributed small numbers of aircraft to the Battle of the Atlantic from 1941 onwards. These were primarily Fw 200 Condors. The Condors also bombed convoys that were beyond land-based fighter cover and thus defenceless. Initially, the Condors were very successful, claiming 365,000 tons of shipping in early 1941. These aircraft were few in number, and directly under control; the pilots had little specialised training for anti-shipping warfare, limiting their effectiveness.

===Italian submarines in the Atlantic===

The Germans received help from their allies. From August 1940, a flotilla of 27 Italian submarines operated from the BETASOM base in Bordeaux to attack Allied shipping in the Atlantic, initially under the command of Rear Admiral Angelo Parona, then of Rear Admiral Romolo Polacchini and finally of Ship-of-the-Line Captain Enzo Grossi. The Italian submarines had been designed to operate in a different way than U-boats, and they had flaws that needed to be corrected (for example huge conning towers, slow speed when surfaced, lack of modern torpedo fire control), which meant that they were ill-suited for convoy attacks, and performed better when hunting down isolated merchantmen on distant seas, taking advantage of their superior range and living standards. Initial operation met with little success (only 65343 GRT sunk between August and December 1940), but the situation improved gradually, and up to August 1943 the 32 Italian submarines that operated there sank 109 ships of 593,864 tons, for 17 subs lost in return, giving them a subs-lost-to-tonnage sunk ratio similar to Germany&#x27;s in the same period, and higher overall. The Italians were also successful with their use of &quot;human torpedo&quot; chariots, disabling several British ships in Gibraltar.

Despite these successes, the Italian intervention was not favourably regarded by Dönitz, who characterised Italians as &quot;inadequately disciplined&quot; and &quot;unable to remain calm in the face of the enemy&quot;. They were unable to co-operate in wolf pack tactics or even reliably report contacts or weather conditions, and their area of operation was moved away from those of the Germans.

Amongst the more successful Italian submarine commanders who operated in the Atlantic were Carlo Fecia di Cossato, commander of the , and Gianfranco Gazzana-Priaroggia, commander of and then of .

==Great surface raiders==
Despite their success, U-boats were still not recognised as the foremost threat to the North Atlantic convoys. With the exception of men like Dönitz, most naval officers on both sides regarded surface warships as the ultimate commerce destroyers.

For the first half of 1940, there were no German surface raiders in the Atlantic because the German Fleet had been concentrated for the invasion of Norway. The sole pocket battleship raider, &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, had been stopped at the Battle of the River Plate by an inferior and outgunned British squadron. From mid-1940 a small but steady stream of warships and armed merchant raiders set sail from Germany for the Atlantic.

The power of a raider against a convoy was demonstrated by the fate of convoy HX 84, attacked by the pocket battleship on 5 November 1940. &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; quickly sank five ships and damaged several others as the convoy scattered. Only the sacrifice of the escorting armed merchant cruiser (whose commander, Edward Fegen, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross) and failing light allowed the other merchantmen to escape. The British now suspended North Atlantic convoys, and the Home Fleet put to sea to try to intercept &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;. The search failed and &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; disappeared into the South Atlantic. She reappeared in the Indian Ocean the following month.

Other German surface raiders now began to make their presence felt. On Christmas Day 1940, the cruiser attacked the troop convoy WS 5A, but was driven off by the escorting cruisers. &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; had more success two months later, on 12 February 1941, when she found the unescorted convoy SLS 64 of 19 ships and sank seven of them. In January 1941, the battleships and put to sea from Germany to raid the shipping lanes in Operation Berlin. With so many German raiders at large in the Atlantic, the British were forced to provide battleship escorts to as many convoys as possible. This twice saved convoys from slaughter by the German battleships. In February, the old battleship deterred an attack on HX 106. A month later, SL 67 was saved by the presence of .

In May, the Germans mounted the most ambitious raid of all: Operation Rheinübung. The new battleship and the cruiser put to sea to attack convoys. A British fleet intercepted the raiders off Iceland. In the Battle of the Denmark Strait, the battlecruiser was blown up and sunk, but &quot;Bismarck&quot; was damaged and had to run to France. &quot;Bismarck&quot; nearly reached her destination, but was disabled by an airstrike from the carrier &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, and then sunk by the Home Fleet the next day. Her sinking marked the end of the warship raids. The advent of long-range search aircraft, notably the unglamorous but versatile PBY Catalina, largely neutralised surface raiders.

In February 1942, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; moved from Brest back to Germany in the &quot;Channel Dash&quot;. While this was an embarrassment for the British, it was the end of the German surface threat in the Atlantic. The loss of &quot;Bismarck&quot;, the destruction of the network of supply ships that supported surface raiders, the repeated damage to the three ships by air raids, the entry of the United States into the war, Arctic convoys, and the perceived invasion threat to Norway had persuaded Hitler and the naval staff to withdraw.

==Escort groups (March–May 1941)==

The disastrous convoy battles of October 1940 forced a change in British tactics. The most important of these was the introduction of permanent escort groups to improve the coordination and effectiveness of ships and men in battle. British efforts were helped by a gradual increase in the number of escort vessels available as the old ex-American destroyers and the new British- and Canadian-built s were now coming into service in numbers. Many of these ships became part of the huge expansion of the Royal Canadian Navy, which grew from a handful of destroyers at the outbreak of war to take an increasing share of convoy escort duty. Others of the new ships were crewed by Free French, Norwegian and Dutch, but these were a tiny minority of the total number, and directly under British command. By 1941 American public opinion had begun to swing against Germany, but the war was still essentially Great Britain and the Empire against Germany.

Initially, the new escort groups consisted of two or three destroyers and half a dozen corvettes. Since two or three of the group would usually be in dock repairing weather or battle damage, the groups typically sailed with about six ships. The training of the escorts also improved as the realities of the battle became obvious. A new base was set up at Tobermory in the Hebrides to prepare the new escort ships and their crews for the demands of battle under the strict regime of Vice-Admiral Gilbert O. Stephenson.

In February 1941, the Admiralty moved the headquarters of Western Approaches Command from Plymouth to Liverpool, where much closer contact with, and control of, the Atlantic convoys was possible. Greater cooperation with supporting aircraft was also achieved. In April, the Admiralty took over operational control of Coastal Command aircraft. Tactically, new short-wave radar sets that could detect surfaced U-boats and were suitable for both small ships and aircraft began to arrive during 1941.

The impact of these changes first began to be felt in the battles in early 1941. In early March, Prien in &quot;U-47&quot; failed to return from patrol. Two weeks later, in the battle of Convoy HX 112, the newly formed 3rd Escort Group of four destroyers and two corvettes held off the U-boat pack. &quot;U-100&quot; was detected by the primitive radar on the destroyer , rammed and sunk. Shortly afterwards &quot;U-99&quot; was also caught and sunk, its crew captured. Dönitz had lost his three leading aces: Kretschmer, Prien, and Schepke.

Dönitz now moved his wolf packs further west, in order to catch the convoys before the anti-submarine escort joined. This new strategy was rewarded at the beginning of April when the pack found Convoy SC 26 before its anti-submarine escort had joined. Ten ships were sunk, but another U-boat was lost.

==The field of battle widens (June–December 1941)==
===Growing American activity===
In June 1941, the British decided to provide convoy escort for the full length of the North Atlantic crossing. To this end, the Admiralty asked the Royal Canadian Navy on 23 May, to assume the responsibility for protecting convoys in the western zone and to establish the base for its escort force at St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. On 13 June 1941, Commodore Leonard Murray, Royal Canadian Navy, assumed his post as Commodore Commanding Newfoundland Escort Force, under the overall authority of the Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches, at Liverpool. Six Canadian destroyers and 17 corvettes, reinforced by seven destroyers, three sloops, and five corvettes of the Royal Navy, were assembled for duty in the force, which escorted the convoys from Canadian ports to Newfoundland and then on to a meeting point south of Iceland, where the British escort groups took over.

By 1941, the United States was taking an increasing part in the war, despite its nominal neutrality. In April 1941 President Roosevelt extended the Pan-American Security Zone east almost as far as Iceland. British forces occupied Iceland when Denmark fell to the Germans in 1940; the US was persuaded to provide forces to relieve British troops on the island. American warships began escorting Allied convoys in the western Atlantic as far as Iceland, and had several hostile encounters with U-boats.

In June 1941, the US realised the tropical Atlantic had become dangerous for unescorted American as well as British ships. On 21 May, , an American vessel carrying no military supplies, was sunk by west of Freetown, Sierra Leone. When news of the sinking reached the US, few shipping companies felt truly safe anywhere. As &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted in June 1941, &quot;if such sinkings continue, U.S. ships bound for other places remote from fighting fronts, will be in danger. Henceforth the U.S. would either have to recall its ships from the ocean or enforce its right to the free use of the seas.&quot;

A Mid-Ocean Escort Force of British, Canadian, and American destroyers and corvettes was organised following the declaration of war by the United States in December 1941.

At the same time, the British were working on technical developments to address the German submarine superiority. Though these were British inventions, the critical technologies were provided freely to the US, which then renamed and manufactured them. Likewise, the US provided the British with Catalina flying boats and Liberator bombers that were important contributions to the war effort.

===Catapult aircraft merchantmen===
Aircraft ranges were constantly improving, but the Atlantic was far too large to be covered completely by land-based types. A stop-gap measure was instituted by fitting ramps to the front of some of the cargo ships known as &quot;catapult aircraft merchantmen&quot; (CAM ships), equipped with a lone expendable Hurricane fighter aircraft. When a German bomber approached, the fighter was launched off the end of the ramp with a large rocket to shoot down or drive off the German aircraft, the pilot then ditching in the water and—in the best case—recovered by ship. Nine combat launches were made, resulting in the destruction of eight Axis aircraft for the loss of one Allied pilot.

Although CAM ships and their Hurricanes did not down a great number of enemy aircraft, such aircraft were mostly Fw 200 Condors that would often shadow the convoy out of range of the convoy&#x27;s guns, reporting back the convoy&#x27;s course and position so that U-boats could then be directed on to the convoy. The CAM ships and their Hurricanes thus justified the cost in fewer ship losses overall.

===High-frequency direction-finding===

One of the more important developments was ship-borne direction-finding radio equipment, known as HF/DF (high-frequency direction-finding, or Huff-Duff), which started to be fitted to escorts from February 1942. These sets were common items of equipment by early 1943. HF/DF let an operator determine the direction of a radio signal, regardless of whether the content could be read. Since the wolf pack relied on U-boats reporting convoy positions by radio, there was a steady stream of messages to intercept. An escort could then run in the direction of the signal and attack the U-boat, or at least force it to submerge (causing it to lose contact), which might prevent an attack on the convoy. When two ships fitted with HF/DF accompanied a convoy, a fix on the transmitter&#x27;s position, not just direction, could be determined. The standard approach of anti-submarine warships was immediately to &quot;run-down&quot; the bearing of a detected signal, hoping to spot the U-boat on the surface and make an immediate attack. Range could be estimated by an experienced operator from the signal strength. Usually the target was found visually. If the submarine was slow to dive, the guns were used; otherwise an ASDIC search was started where the swirl of water of a crash-diving submarine was observed. In good visibility a U-boat might try and outrun an escort on the surface whilst out of gun range.

The British also made extensive use of shore HF/DF stations, to keep convoys updated with positions of U-boats. HF/DF was also installed on American ships.

The radio technology behind direction finding was simple and well understood by both sides, but the technology commonly used before the war used a manually-rotated aerial to fix the direction of the transmitter. This was delicate work, took quite a time to accomplish to any degree of accuracy, and since it only revealed the line along which the transmission originated a single set could not determine if the transmission was from the true direction or its reciprocal 180 degrees in the opposite direction. Two sets were required to fix the position. Believing this to still be the case, German U-boat radio operators considered themselves fairly safe if they kept messages short. The British developed an oscilloscope-based indicator which instantly fixed the direction and its reciprocal the moment a radio operator touched his Morse key. It worked simply with a crossed pair of conventional and fixed directional aerials, the oscilloscope display showing the relative received strength from each aerial as an elongated ellipse showing the line relative to the ship. The innovation was a &#x27;sense&#x27; aerial, which, when switched in, suppressed the ellipse in the &#x27;wrong&#x27; direction leaving only the correct bearing. With this there was hardly any need to triangulate—the escort could just run down the precise bearing provided, estimating range from the signal strength, and use look-outs or radar for final positioning. Many U-boat attacks were suppressed and submarines sunk in this way.

===Enigma cipher===
The way Dönitz conducted the U-boat campaign required relatively large volumes of radio traffic between U-boats and headquarters. This was thought to be safe, as the radio messages were encrypted using the Enigma cipher machine, which the Germans considered unbreakable. In addition, the used much more secure operating procedures than the (Army) or (Air Force). The machine&#x27;s three rotors were chosen from a set of eight (rather than the other services&#x27; five). The rotors were changed every other day using a system of key sheets and the message settings were different for every message and determined from &quot;bigram tables&quot; that were issued to operators. In 1939, it was generally believed at the British Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park that naval Enigma could not be broken. Only the head of the German Naval Section, Frank Birch, and the mathematician Alan Turing believed otherwise.

The British codebreakers needed to know the wiring of the special naval Enigma rotors. The capture of several Enigma rotors during the sinking of by in February 1940 provided this information. In early 1941, the Royal Navy made a concerted effort to assist the codebreakers, and on 9 May crew members of the destroyer boarded and recovered cryptologic material, including bigram tables and current Enigma keys. The captured material allowed all U-boat traffic to be read for several weeks, until the keys ran out; the familiarity codebreakers gained with the usual content of messages helped in breaking new keys.

In August 1940, the British began use of their &quot;bombe&quot; computer which, when presented with an intercepted German Enigma message, suggested possible settings with which the Enigma cipher machine had been programmed. A reverse-engineered Enigma machine in British hands could then be programmed with each set of suggested settings in turn until the message was successfully deciphered.

Throughout late 1941, Enigma intercepts (combined with HF/DF) enabled the British to plot the positions of U-boat patrol lines and route convoys around them. Merchant ship losses dropped by over two-thirds in July 1941, and the losses remained low until November.

This Allied advantage was offset by the growing numbers of U-boats coming into service. The Type VIIC began reaching the Atlantic in large numbers in 1941; by the end of 1945, 568 had been commissioned. Although the Allies could protect their convoys in late 1941, they were not sinking many U-boats. The Flower-class corvette escorts could detect and defend, but they were not fast enough to attack effectively.

===U-boat captured by an aircraft===
A Coastal Command Hudson of No. 209 Squadron RAF captured &quot;U-570&quot; on 27 August 1941 about south of Iceland. Squadron Leader J. Thompson sighted the U-boat on the surface, immediately dived at his target, and released four depth charges as the submarine crash dived. The U-boat surfaced again, crewmen appeared on deck, and Thompson engaged them with his aircraft&#x27;s guns. The crewmen returned to the conning tower under fire. A few moments later, a white flag and a similarly coloured board were displayed. Thompson called for assistance and circled the German vessel. A Catalina from 209 Squadron took over watching the damaged U-boat until the arrival of the armed trawler &quot;Kingston Agate&quot; under Lt Henry Owen L&#x27;Estrange. The following day the U-boat was beached in an Icelandic cove. No codes or secret papers were recovered, but the British now possessed a complete U-boat. After a refit, &quot;U-570&quot; was commissioned into the Royal Navy as .

=== Mediterranean diversion ===
In October 1941, Hitler ordered Dönitz to move U-boats into the Mediterranean Sea to support German operations in that theatre. The resulting concentration near Gibraltar produced a series of battles around the Gibraltar and Sierra Leone convoys. In December 1941, Convoy HG 76 sailed, escorted by the 36th Escort Group of two sloops and six corvettes under Captain Frederic John Walker, reinforced by the first of the new escort carriers, , and three destroyers from Gibraltar. The convoy was immediately intercepted by the waiting U-boat pack, resulting in a brutal five-day battle. Walker was a tactical innovator and his ships&#x27; crews were highly trained. The presence of an escort carrier meant U-boats were frequently sighted and forced to dive before they could get close to the convoy, at least until &quot;Audacity&quot; was sunk after two days. The five-day battle cost the Germans five U-boats (four sunk by Walker&#x27;s group), while the British lost &quot;Audacity&quot;, a destroyer, and only two merchant ships. The battle was the first clear Allied convoy victory.

Through dogged effort, the Allies slowly gained the upper hand until the end of 1941. Although Allied warships failed to sink U-boats in large numbers, most convoys evaded attack completely. Shipping losses were high, but manageable.

==Operation Drumbeat (January–June 1942)==


The attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent German declaration of war on the United States had an immediate effect on the campaign. Dönitz planned to attack shipping off the American East Coast. He had only five Type IX boats able to reach US waters for Operation Drumbeat (&quot;Paukenschlag&quot;), sometimes called by the Germans the &quot;second happy time.&quot;

The US, having no direct experience of modern naval war on its own shores, did not employ a blackout. U-boats stood off shore at night and picked out ships silhouetted against city lights. Admiral Ernest King, Commander-in-Chief United States Fleet (Cominch), who disliked the British, initially rejected Royal Navy calls for a coastal blackout or convoy system. King has been criticised for this decision, but his defenders argue the United States destroyer fleet was limited (partly because of the sale of 50 old destroyers to Britain earlier in the war), and King claimed it was far more important that destroyers protect Allied troop transports than merchant shipping. His ships were also busy convoying Lend-Lease material to the Soviet Union, as well as fighting the Japanese in the Pacific. King could not require coastal blackouts—the Army had legal authority over all civil defence— and did not follow advice the Royal Navy (or Royal Canadian Navy) provided that even unescorted convoys would be safer than merchants sailing individually. No troop transports were lost, but merchant ships sailing in US waters were left exposed and suffered accordingly. Britain eventually had to build coastal escorts and provide them to the US in a &quot;reverse Lend Lease&quot;, since King was unable (or unwilling) to make any provision himself.

The first U-boats reached US waters on 13 January 1942. By the time they withdrew on 6 February, they had sunk 156,939 tonnes of shipping without loss. The first batch of Type IXs was followed by more Type IXs and Type VIIs supported by Type XIV &quot;Milk Cow&quot; tankers which provided refuelling at sea. They sank 397 ships totalling over 2 million tons. In 1943, the United States launched over 11 million tons of merchant shipping; that number declined in the later war years, as priorities moved elsewhere.

In May, King (by this time both Cominch and CNO) finally scraped together enough ships to institute a convoy system. This quickly led to the loss of seven U-boats. The US did not have enough ships to cover all the gaps; the U-boats continued to operate freely during the Battle of the Caribbean and throughout the Gulf of Mexico (where they effectively closed several US ports) until July, when the British-loaned escorts began arriving. These included 24 anti-submarine armed trawlers. The institution of an interlocking convoy system on the American coast and in the Caribbean Sea in mid-1942 resulted in an immediate drop in attacks in those areas. As a result of the increased coastal convoy escort system, the U-boats&#x27; attention was shifted back to the Atlantic convoys. For the Allies, the situation was serious but not critical throughout much of 1942.

==Battle returns to the mid-Atlantic (July 1942 – February 1943)==

With the US finally arranging convoys in their sector of the Atlantic, ship losses to the U-boats quickly dropped, and Dönitz realised his U-boats were better used elsewhere. On 19 July 1942, he ordered the last boats to withdraw from the United States Atlantic coast; by the end of July 1942 he had shifted his attention back to the North Atlantic, where allied aircraft could not provide cover—i.e. the Black Pit. Convoy SC 94 marked the return of the U-boats to the convoys from Canada to Britain. The command centre for the submarines operating in the West, including the Atlantic also changed, moving to a newly constructed command bunker at the Château de Pignerolle just east of Angers on the Loire river. The headquarters was commanded by Hans-Rudolf Rösing.

There were enough U-boats spread across the Atlantic to allow several wolf packs to attack many different convoy routes. Often as many as 10 to 15 boats would attack in one or two waves, following convoys like SC 104 and SC 107 by day and attacking at night. Convoy losses quickly increased and in October 1942, 56 ships of over 258,000 tonnes were sunk in the &quot;air gap&quot; between Greenland and Iceland.

U-boat losses also climbed. In the first six months of 1942, 21 were lost, less than one for every 40 merchant ships sunk. In the last six months of 1942, 66 were sunk, one for every 10 merchant ships, almost as many as in the previous two years together.

On 19 November 1942, Admiral Noble was replaced as Commander-in-Chief of Western Approaches Command by Admiral Sir Max Horton. Horton used the growing number of escorts becoming available to organise &quot;support groups&quot;, to reinforce convoys that came under attack. Unlike the regular escort groups, support groups were not directly responsible for the safety of any particular convoy. This gave them much greater tactical flexibility, allowing them to detach ships to hunt submarines spotted by reconnaissance or picked up by HF/DF. Where regular escorts would have to break off and stay with their convoy, the support group ships could keep hunting a U-boat for many hours. One tactic introduced by Captain John Walker was the &quot;hold-down&quot;, where a group of ships would patrol over a submerged U-boat until its air ran out and it was forced to the surface; this might take two or three days.

After Convoy ON 154, winter weather provided a brief respite from the fighting in January before convoys SC 118 and ON 166 in February 1943, but in the spring, convoy battles started up again with the same ferocity. There were so many U-boats on patrol in the North Atlantic, it was difficult for convoys to evade detection, resulting in a succession of vicious battles.

===Western Approaches Tactical Unit===

Between February 1942 and July 1945, about 5,000 naval officers played war games at &quot;Western Approaches Tactical Unit&quot;. Many game graduates believed that the battle they fought on the linoleum floor was essential to their subsequent victory at sea. In November 1942, Admiral Horton tested &quot;Beta Search&quot; in a wargame. Janet Okell and Jean Laidlaw played the role of the escorts. Five times in a row Okell and Laidlaw sank the submarine of Admiral Horton, the commander-in chief of Western Approaches.

===Ahead-throwing weapons===
At the start of World War II, the depth charge was the only weapon available to a vessel for destroying a submerged submarine. Depth charges were dropped over the stern and thrown to the side of a warship travelling at speed. Early models of ASDIC/Sonar searched only ahead, astern and to the sides of the anti-submarine vessel that was using it: there was no downward-looking capability. So there was a time lag between the last fix obtained on the submarine and the warship reaching a point above that position. Then the depth charges had to sink to the depth at which they were set to explode. During those two delays, a capable submarine commander would manoeuvre rapidly to a different position and avoid the attack. The depth charges then left an area of disturbed water, through which it was difficult to regain ASDIC/Sonar contact. In response to this problem, one of the solutions developed by the Royal Navy was the ahead-throwing anti-submarine weapon—the first of which was Hedgehog.

Hedgehog was a multiple spigot mortar, which fired contact-fused bombs ahead of the firing ship while the target was still within the ASDIC beam. These started to be installed on anti-submarine ships from late 1942. The warship could approach slowly (as it did not have to clear the area of exploding depth charges to avoid damage) and so its position was less obvious to the submarine commander as it was making less noise. Because hedgehog only exploded if it hit the submarine, if the target was missed, there was no disturbed water to make tracking difficult—and contact had not been lost in the first place.

====Squid====
Squid was an improvement on &#x27;Hedgehog&#x27; introduced in late 1943. A three-barrelled mortar, it projected charges ahead or abeam; the charges&#x27; firing pistols were automatically set just before launch. The more advanced installations linked Squid to the latest ASDIC sets so that the weapon was fired automatically.

===Leigh Light===

Detection by radar-equipped aircraft could suppress U-boat activity over a wide area, but an aircraft attack could only be successful with good visibility. U-boats were relatively safe from aircraft at night for two reasons: 1) radar then in use could not detect them at less than ; 2) flares deployed to illuminate any attack gave adequate warning for evasive manoeuvres. The introduction of the Leigh Light by the British in January 1942 solved the second problem, thereby becoming a significant factor in the Battle for the Atlantic. Developed by RAF officer H. Leigh, it was a powerful and controllable searchlight mounted primarily to Wellington bombers and B-24 Liberators. These aircraft first located enemy submarines using air-to-surface-vessel (ASV) radar. Then, about from the target, the Leigh Light would be switched on. It immediately and accurately illuminated the enemy, giving U-boat commanders less than 25 seconds to react before they were attacked with depth charges. The first confirmed kill using this technology was &quot;U-502&quot; on 5 July 1942.

The Leigh Light enabled the British to attack enemy subs on the surface at night, forcing German and Italian commanders to remain underwater especially when coming into port at sub bases in the Bay of Biscay. U-boat commanders who survived such attacks reported a particular fear of this weapon since aircraft could not be seen at night, and the noise of an approaching aircraft was inaudible above the sound of the sub&#x27;s engines. The common practice of surfacing at night to recharge batteries and refresh air was mostly abandoned as it was safer to perform these tasks during daylight hours when enemy planes could be spotted.

===Metox receiver===
By August 1942, U-boats were being fitted with radar detectors to enable them to avoid ambushes by radar-equipped aircraft or ships. The first such receiver, named Metox after its French manufacturer, could pick up the metric radar bands used by the early radars. This enabled U-boats to avoid detection by Canadian escorts, which were equipped with obsolete radar sets, and allowed them to track convoys where these sets were in use.

It also caused problems for the Germans, as it sometimes detected stray radar emissions from distant ships or planes, leading U-boats to submerge when they were not in danger, preventing them from recharging batteries or using their surfaced speed.

Metox provided the U-boat commander with an advantage that had not been anticipated by the British. The Metox set beeped at the pulse rate of the hunting aircraft&#x27;s radar, about once per second. When the radar operator came within of the U-boat, he changed the range of his radar. With the change of range, the radar doubled its pulse frequency and as a result, the Metox beeping frequency also doubled, warning the commander that he had been detected and that the approaching aircraft was nine miles away.

===Germans break Admiralty codes===

In 1941, American intelligence informed Rear Admiral John Henry Godfrey that the UK naval codes could be broken. In March 1942, the Germans broke Naval Cipher 3, used for Anglo-American communication. Eighty per cent of the Admiralty messages from March 1942 to June 1943 were read by the Germans. The sinking of Allied merchant ships increased dramatically.

Günter Hessler, Admiral Dönitz&#x27;s son-in-law and first staff officer at U-boat Command, said:
&quot;We had reached a stage when it took one or two days to decrypt the British radio messages. On occasions only a few hours were required. We could sometimes deduce when and how they would take advantage of the gaps in our U-boat dispositions. Our function was to close those gaps just before the convoys were due.&quot; The code breakers of Bletchley Park assigned only two people to evaluate whether the Germans broke the code. After five months, they finally determined that the codes were broken. In August 1942, the UK Admiralty was informed. The Admiralty did not change the codes until June 1943.

Captain Raymond Dreyer, deputy staff signals officer at Western Approaches, the British HQ for the Battle of the Atlantic in Liverpool, said, &quot;Some of their most successful U-boat pack attacks on our convoys were based on information obtained by breaking our ciphers.&quot;

===Enigma in 1942===

On 1 February 1942, the switched the U-boats to a new Enigma network (TRITON) that used the new, four-rotor, Enigma machines. This new key could not be read by codebreakers; the Allies no longer knew where the U-boat patrol lines were. This made it far more difficult to evade contact, and the wolf packs ravaged many convoys. This persisted for ten months. To obtain information on submarine movements the Allies had to make do with HF/DF fixes and decrypts of messages encoded on earlier Enigma machines. These messages included signals from coastal forces about U-boat arrivals and departures at their bases in France, and the reports from the U-boat training command. From these clues, Commander Rodger Winn&#x27;s Admiralty Submarine Tracking Room supplied their best estimates of submarine movements, but this information was not enough.

On 30 October, crewmen from salvaged Enigma material from as she foundered off Port Said. This allowed the codebreakers to break TRITON. By December 1942, Enigma decrypts were again disclosing U-boat patrol positions, and shipping losses declined dramatically once more.

==Climax of the campaign (March–May 1943, &quot;Black May&quot;)==
On 10 March 1943, the Germans added a refinement to the U-boat Enigma key, which blinded the Allied codebreakers at Bletchley Park for 9 days. That month saw the battles of convoys UGS 6, HX 228, SC 121, SC 122 and HX 229. One hundred and twenty ships were sunk worldwide, 82 ships of 476,000 tons in the Atlantic, while 12 U-boats were destroyed.

The supply situation in Britain was such that there was talk of being unable to continue the war, with supplies of fuel being particularly low. The situation was so bad that the British considered abandoning convoys entirely. The next two months saw a complete reversal of fortunes.

In April, losses of U-boats increased and their kills fell significantly. Only 39 ships of 235,000 tons were sunk in the Atlantic, and 15 U-boats were destroyed. By May, wolf packs no longer had the advantage and that month became known as Black May in the U-boat Arm (). The turning point was the battle centred on slow convoy ONS 5 (April–May 1943). Made up of 43 merchantmen escorted by 16 warships, it was attacked by a pack of 30 U-boats. Although 13 merchant ships were lost, six U-boats were sunk by the escorts or Allied aircraft. Despite a storm which scattered the convoy, the merchantmen reached the protection of land-based air cover, causing Dönitz to call off the attack. Two weeks later, SC 130 saw at least three U-boats destroyed and at least one U-boat damaged for no losses. Faced with disaster, Dönitz called off operations in the North Atlantic, saying, &quot;We had lost the Battle of the Atlantic&quot;.

On 13 April RAF Coastal Command started its second Bay Offensive with operation Derange. Seventy-five long range aircraft equipped with the new centrimetric ASV Mark III radar with PPI display patrolled regions in the Bay of Biscay with known concentrations (through enigma decrypts) of U-boats in transit. The German metox radar detector operated only in the metric band and did not detect the new centrimetric radar emissions. As a result, many U-boats were surprised and attacked. In response Dönitz ordered his U-boats to stay on the surface and fight it out with the aircraft. Some U-boats were converted to &quot;&quot;flak&quot; boats&quot; with extra and new anti-aircraft guns, but to no avail: In May five U-boats were sunk and another seven were forced to abort.

In all, 43 U-boats were destroyed in May, 34 in the Atlantic. This was 25% of German U-boat Arm&#x27;s total operational strength. The Allies lost 58 ships in the same period, 34 of these (totalling 134,000 tons) in the Atlantic.

===Convergence of technologies===
The Battle of the Atlantic was won by the Allies in two months. There was no single reason for this; what had changed was a sudden convergence of technologies, combined with an increase in Allied resources.

The mid-Atlantic gap that had previously been unreachable by aircraft was closed by long-range B-24 Liberators. On 18 March 1943, Roosevelt ordered King to transfer 60 Liberators from the Pacific theatre to the Atlantic to combat German U-boats; one of only two direct orders he gave to his military commanders in WWII (the other was regarding Operation Torch). At the May 1943 Trident conference, Admiral King requested General Henry H. Arnold to send a squadron of ASW-configured B-24s to Newfoundland to strengthen the air escort of North Atlantic convoys. General Arnold ordered his squadron commander to engage only in &quot;offensive&quot; search and attack missions and not in the escort of convoys. In June, General Arnold suggested the Navy assume responsibility for ASW operations. Admiral King requested the Army&#x27;s ASW-configured B-24s in exchange for an equal number of unmodified Navy B-24s. Agreement was reached in July and the exchange was completed in September 1943.Further air cover was provided by the introduction of merchant aircraft carriers (MAC ships), and later the growing numbers of American-built escort carriers. Primarily flying Grumman F4F Wildcats and Grumman TBF Avengers, they sailed with the convoys and provided much-needed air cover and patrols all the way across the Atlantic.
Larger numbers of escorts became available, both as a result of American building programmes and the release of escorts committed to the North African landings during November and December 1942. In particular, destroyer escorts (DEs) (similar British ships were known as &quot;frigates&quot;) were designed to be built economically, compared to fleet destroyers and sloops whose warship-standards construction and sophisticated armaments made them too expensive for mass production. Destroyer escorts and frigates were also better designed for mid-ocean anti-submarine warfare than corvettes, which, although maneuverable and seaworthy, were too short, slow, and inadequately armed to match the DEs. Not only would there be sufficient numbers of escorts to securely protect convoys, they could also form hunter-killer groups (often centred on escort carriers) to aggressively hunt U-boats.

During May 1943, the US Navy began using a high-speed bombe of its own design which could deduce the settings of the new four-rotor German Enigma cipher machines. By September 1944, 121 of the new high-speed bombes were at work.

Dönitz&#x27;s aim in this tonnage war was to sink Allied ships faster than they could be replaced; as losses fell and production rose, particularly in the United States, this became impossible.

==South Atlantic (May 1942 – September 1943)==
Despite U-boat operations in the region (centred in the Atlantic Narrows between Brazil and West Africa) beginning late 1940, only in the following year did these start to raise serious concern in Washington. This perceived threat caused the US to decide that the introduction of US forces along Brazil&#x27;s coast would be valuable. After negotiations with Brazilian Foreign Minister Osvaldo Aranha (on behalf of dictator Getúlio Vargas), these were introduced in second half of 1941.

Germany and Italy subsequently extended their submarine attacks to include Brazilian ships wherever they were, and from April 1942 were found in Brazilian waters. On 22 May 1942, the first Brazilian attack (although unsuccessful) was carried out by Brazilian Air Force aircraft on the . After a series of attacks on merchant vessels off the Brazilian coast by , Brazil officially entered the war on 22 August 1942, offering an important addition to the Allied strategic position in the South Atlantic.

Although the Brazilian Navy was small, it had modern minelayers suitable for coastal convoy escort and aircraft which needed only small modifications to become suitable for maritime patrol. During its three years of war, mainly in Caribbean and South Atlantic, alone and in conjunction with the US, Brazil escorted 3,167 ships in 614 convoys, totalling 16,500,000 tons, with losses of 0.1%. Nine hundred and seventy-two seamen and civilian passengers were lost aboard the 32 Brazilian merchant vessels attacked by enemy submarines. American and Brazilian air and naval forces worked closely together until the end of the Battle. One example was the sinking of in July 1943, by a coordinated action of Brazilian and American aircraft. In Brazilian waters, eleven other Axis submarines were known to be sunk between January and September 1943—the Italian and ten German boats: , , , &quot;U-507&quot;, , , , , , and .

By late 1943, the decreasing number of Allied shipping losses in the South Atlantic coincided with the increasing elimination of Axis submarines operating there. From then on, the battle in the region was lost by Germany, even though most of the remaining submarines in the region received an official order of withdrawal only in August 1944, and with the last Allied merchant ship (&quot;Baron Jedburgh&quot;) sunk by a U-boat (&quot;U-532&quot;) there, on 10 March 1945.

==Final years (June 1943 – May 1945)==
After the defeat on the North Atlantic convoy lanes, it became clear to Dönitz and Hitler that a new generation of U-boats was urgently needed. There was a programme to develop Walter U-boats which achieved high underwater speeds with a revolutionary hydrogen peroxide air-independent propellant system, but this faced many technical setbacks and these U-boats would not become available in time. Instead it was decided to modify these designs where the new propulsion system was replaced with much larger battery capacity for a conventional U-boat propulsion system, the types. Since the design was ready, it was hoped that by mass-producing the U-boat in prefabricated sections, these new Type XXI oceangoing and coastal Type XXIII would become operational in mid-1944. In the meantime, as a stopgap measure until these &quot;Elektroboote&quot; became available, the existing U-boat designs were gradually equipped with a (snorkel), which allowed U-boats to run their diesel engines whilst submerged and recharge their batteries.

The U-boats left the North Atlantic convoy lanes and shifted their attacks to the American-Mediterranean convoys in the Central Atlantic. The Allies learned from this move through intelligence and anticipated by ordering three US Navy task Groups centred around the escort carriers &quot;Card&quot;, &quot;Bogue&quot; and &quot;Santee&quot; to the region. These escort carriers protected the convoys, but were not part of its close escort and were allowed to search and destroy U-boats and their supporting U-boat tankers on HF/DF bearings. Only 1 ship was lost, but the escort carriers sank 17 U-boats. After this defeat, Dönitz halted all wolfpack operations in the beginning of August until U-boats could be upgraded with better weapons and measures. At the same time the British were allowed to access the harbours at the Portuguese Azores Islands and to operate Allied military aircraft based in the Azores, which closed the air gap in the Mid-Atlantic and made operations there equally hazardous. From June to September 1943 Coastal Command kept up its Bay offensive with operations Musketry, Seaslug and Percussion. By the first week of August 1941 U-boats were sunk in the Bay of Biscay. The Bay offensive was intensified by sending escort and support groups into the Bay but these ships were driven off by German Dornier Do 217 aircraft armed with Henschel Hs 293 guided glide bomb, which claimed several victims.

In September 1943 Dönitz hoped to surprise the Allies by sending the Wolfpack Leuthen back to the North Atlantic convoy lanes. These U-boats were equipped with T5 &quot;Zaunkönig&quot; acoustic torpedoes, better anti-aircraft guns, a new &quot;Wanze&quot; radar detector and &quot;Afrodite&quot; radar decoys. In an adaptation of their wolfpack tactics, they were ordered first to attack convoy escorts with their acoustic torpedoes before attacking the merchant ships. The group achieved surprise and success in its first attack on convoys ONS 18 and ON 202, but all subsequent attacks were beaten off with heavy loss for the Germans. Other wolfpacks Rossbach, Schlieffen and Siegfried were formed and kept the new campaign going but could achieve little for heavy losses. Only eight ships of 56,000 tons and six warships had been sunk for the loss of 39 U-boats, a catastrophic loss ratio. In November Dönitz finally recognized wolfpack attacks were not viable anymore in the face of heavy convoy escort and dispersed his U-boats.
From January 1944 onwards, Dönitz tried to preserve his U-Boat strength in order to be able to repel an expected invasion in both Norway and France. The number of patrols by his Atlantic U-boats fell from 41 in January to 10 in May. Since U-boats were still diverted to the Mediterranean or kept in reserve in Norway and since operational losses were high, the number of available U-boats in the Atlantic force sank in the same period from 121 to 89. Dönitz had hoped the could pick up the offensive on the convoy lanes again in 1944, but the construction of these boats was delayed by shortages of skilled workers and Allied bombing on shipyards and U-boat engine factories. Only in April 1944 was the first type XXI launched and its submerged speed and diving depth proved to be inferior to the designed performance.

On D-Day, Atlantic operations were suspended and all available 36 U-boats, later reinforced with another seven, were sent out to confront Operation Neptune. For the loss of thirteen of their own, these U-boats sank only eight of the 5,339 vessels participating in the invasion of Normandy. Air patrols made operations for U-boats not equipped with a impossible and these had to be recalled. A further eleven U-boats arrived from Norway in the second week of the invasion, but they sank only two ships for the loss of seven U-boats. With the Allied advance in France, the U-boat bases in Brest and Bordeaux were lost in August–September. The other three bases in Lorient, St-Nazaire and La Pallice were evacuated but remained in German hands until the end of the war. No operations could be mounted from these bases and the remaining 30 U-boats were evacuated to Norway. Between 16 May and 1 November 72 U-boats were lost, whilst they could only sink twelve small warships and fourteen merchant ships for 60,000 tons.

Norway was too far away from the convoy lanes in order to organise group attacks by the U-Boats. In order to keep up the offensive pending the arrival of the , 68 patrols were organised from Norway towards British waters between July and December 1944. Only Type VII U-boats could be used as Allied air superiority excluded continuous cruising on surface. Sixteen U-boats were lost. In the same period, seventeen of the longer range type IX U-boats were sent to Canada and the Azores. These U-boats had also , and were equipped with new technology : they had new &#x27;Fliege&#x27; and &#x27;Mücke&#x27; radar detectors and a new &#x27;Hohentwiel&#x27; search radar. They sank six warships and nine merchants ships for the loss of seven U-boats.

In 1945 Dönitz continued with the same approach: type VII U-boats mounted 113 patrols to British waters from Norway and Germany. Sixty-five U-boats were lost by the end of the war. Another nineteen type IX U-boats sailed for the Americas; these U-boats sank three small warships and three merchants for the loss of nine of their own. Of the much awaited , only five Type XXIII coastal made seven patrols in 1945 which sank five small freighters. Only one of the big type XXI embarked upon a patrol before the end of the war but it did not see action. In the last month of the war, many U-boats fled the Baltic ports as they were overrun by the Russian army. Eight and nine other U-boats were sunk by Allied aircraft as they fled towards bases in Norway.

The last actions in American waters took place on 5–6 May 1945, which saw the sinking of the steamer and the destruction of and in separate incidents. The last actions of the Battle of the Atlantic were on 7–8 May. was the last U-boat sunk in action, by an RAF Catalina; while the Norwegian minesweeper and the freighters and were torpedoed in separate incidents, hours before the German surrender.

At the end of the war, 222 U-boats were scuttled by their crews. The remaining 174 U-boats, at sea or in port, were surrendered to the Allies. Most were destroyed in &quot;Operation Deadlight&quot; after the war, but some served in Allied navies. Six were in Japan at the time of the German surrender and were captured by the Japanese.

===German tactical and technical changes===
The development of torpedoes also improved with the pattern-running -Torpedo (FAT), which ran a pre-programmed course criss-crossing the convoy path and the G7es acoustic torpedo (known to the Allies as German Naval Acoustic Torpedo, GNAT), which homed on the propeller noise of a target. This was initially very effective, but the Allies quickly developed counter-measures, both tactical (&quot;Step-Aside&quot;) and technical (&quot;Foxer&quot;).

==Outcomes==
The Germans failed to stop the flow of strategic supplies to Britain. This failure resulted in the build-up of troops and supplies needed for the D-Day landings. The defeat of the U-boat was a necessary precursor for accumulation of Allied troops and supplies to ensure Germany&#x27;s defeat.

Between 1939 and 1945, 72,200 Allied naval and merchant seamen died. The Germans lost about 30,000 U-boat sailors killed, three-quarters of the 40,000-man U-boat fleet.

The Admiralty later estimated that ceding the three Treaty Ports to Ireland in 1938 led to the loss of 368 Allied ships and 5,070 lives during the war.

=== Merchant losses ===

=== Surface fleet losses ===
The German surface fleet commissioned 16 capital ships before or during the war: 4 battleships, 6 heavy cruisers and 6 light cruisers. Of these, only the and were sunk in battle on the Atlantic Ocean. Three cruisers were sunk during the April 1940 invasion of Norway and was sunk in the Arctic. Apart from the heavy cruiser and light cruiser all other ships were destroyed in port by bombers.

The British and Allied fleets fought battles all over the world and lost many ships, but only three ships were lost in battle against German surface ships : the battlecruiser &quot;Hood&quot; and the light cruisers Sydney and &quot;Charybdis&quot;.

U-boats sank 175 Allied warships in total, in all theatres of operations. Many of these were sunk in the Mediterranean or the Arctic. The adversaries of U-boats were mostly small anti-submarine ships like destroyers, destroyer escorts, frigates and corvettes, but on a few occasions U-boats could sink capital ships in the Atlantic: the battleship &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was sunk in harbour, the aircraft carrier &quot;Courageous&quot; was sunk while on anti-submarine patrol, the escort carriers &quot;Audacity&quot;, &quot;Avenger&quot; and &quot;Block Island&quot; were sunk while escorting convoys, and the light cruiser &quot;Dunedin&quot; was sunk searching for German raiders.

=== U-boat losses ===
==Merchant Navy==

===United Kingdom===
During the Second World War nearly one third of the world&#x27;s merchant shipping was British. Over 30,000 men from the British Merchant Navy died between 1939 and 1945. More than 2,400 British ships were sunk. The ships were crewed by sailors from all over the British Empire, including 25% from India and China, and 5% from the West Indies, Middle East and Africa. The British officers wore uniforms very similar to those of the Royal Navy. The ordinary sailors had no uniform and when on leave in Britain they sometimes suffered taunts and abuse from civilians who thought the crewmen were shirking their duty to enlist in the armed forces. To counter this, the crewmen were issued with an &#x27;MN&#x27; lapel badge to indicate they were serving in the Merchant Navy.

The British merchant fleet was made up of vessels from the many and varied private shipping lines, examples being the tankers of the British Tanker Company and the freighters of Ellerman and Silver Lines. The British government, via the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT), also had new ships built during the course of the war, these being known as Empire ships.

===United States===
In addition to its existing merchant fleet, United States shipyards built 2,710 Liberty ships totalling 38.5 million tons, vastly exceeding the 14 million tons of shipping the German U-boats were able to sink during the war.

===Canada===
Information obtained by British agents regarding German shipping movements led Canada to conscript all its merchant vessels two weeks before declaring war, with the Royal Canadian Navy taking control of all shipping on 26 August 1939. At the outbreak of the war, Canada possessed 38 ocean-going merchant vessels. By the end of hostilities, in excess of 400 cargo ships had been built in Canada. More than 70 Canadian merchant vessels were lost. An estimated 1,500 merchant sailors were killed, including eight women.

At the end of the war, Rear Admiral Leonard Murray, Commander-in-Chief Canadian North Atlantic, remarked, &quot;...the Battle of the Atlantic was not won by any Navy or Air Force, it was won by the courage, fortitude and determination of the British and Allied Merchant Navy.&quot;

===Norway===
Before the war, Norway&#x27;s Merchant Navy was the fourth largest in the world and its ships were the most modern. The Germans and the Allies both recognised the great importance of Norway&#x27;s merchant fleet, and following Germany&#x27;s invasion of Norway in April 1940, both sides sought control of the ships. Norwegian Nazi puppet leader Vidkun Quisling ordered all Norwegian ships to sail to German, Italian or neutral ports. He was ignored. All Norwegian ships decided to serve at the disposal of the Allies. The vessels of the Norwegian Merchant Navy were placed under the control of the government-run Nortraship, with headquarters in London and New York.

Nortraship&#x27;s modern ships, especially its tankers, were extremely important to the Allies. Norwegian tankers carried nearly one-third of the oil transported to Britain during the war. Records show that 694 Norwegian ships were sunk during this period, representing 47% of the total fleet. At the end of the war in 1945, the Norwegian merchant fleet was estimated at 1,378 ships. More than 3,700 Norwegian merchant seamen died.

==Assessment==
It is maintained by G. H. Persall that &quot;the Germans were close&quot; to economically starving England, but they &quot;failed to capitalize&quot; on their early war successes. Others, including Blair and Alan Levine, disagree; Levine states this is &quot;a misperception&quot;, and that &quot;it is doubtful they ever came close&quot; to achieving this.

The focus on U-boat successes, the &quot;aces&quot; and their scores, the convoys attacked, and the ships sunk, serves to camouflage the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; manifold failures. In particular, this was because most of the ships sunk by U-boats were not in convoys, but sailing alone, or having become separated from convoys.

At no time during the campaign were supply lines to Britain interrupted; even during the &quot;Bismarck&quot; crisis, convoys sailed as usual (although with heavier escorts). In all, during the Atlantic campaign only 10% of transatlantic convoys that sailed were attacked, and of those attacked only 10% on average of the ships were lost. Overall, more than 99% of all ships sailing to and from the British Isles during World War II did so successfully.

Despite their efforts, the Axis powers were unable to prevent the build-up of Allied invasion forces for the liberation of Europe. In November 1942, at the height of the Atlantic campaign, the US Navy escorted the Operation Torch invasion fleet across the Atlantic without hindrance, or even being detected. In 1943 and 1944 the Allies transported 3 million American and Allied servicemen across the Atlantic without significant loss. By 1945 the USN was able to wipe out a wolf-pack suspected of carrying V-weapons in the mid-Atlantic, with little difficulty.

Third, and unlike the Allies, the Germans were never able to mount a comprehensive blockade of Britain. Nor were they able to focus their effort by targeting the most valuable cargoes, the eastbound traffic carrying war materiel. Instead they were reduced to the slow attrition of a tonnage war. To win this, the U-boat arm had to sink 300,000 GRT per month in order to overwhelm Britain&#x27;s shipbuilding capacity and reduce its merchant marine strength.

In only four out of the first 27 months of the war did Germany achieve this target, and after December 1941, when Britain was joined by the US merchant marine and ship yards the target effectively doubled. As a result, the Axis needed to sink 700,000 GRT per month; as the massive expansion of the US shipbuilding industry took effect this target increased still further. The 700,000 ton target was achieved in only one month, November 1942; after May 1943 average sinkings dropped to less than one tenth of that figure. In addition, reports do not consistently emphasize an important distinction between GRT (tonnage in units of 100 cubic feet), which is not a weight, and displacement, which is. Thus sinking a ship with a GRT of 1,000, destroyed 100,000 cubic feet of enclosed space, which bore no fixed relationship to the volume or tonnage of cargo it could carry.

By the end of the war the Allies had built over 38 million tons of new shipping.

The reason for the misperception that the German blockade came close to success may be found in post-war writings by both German and British authors. Blair attributes the distortion to &quot;propagandists&quot; who &quot;glorified and exaggerated the successes of German submariners&quot;, while he believes Allied writers &quot;had their own reasons for exaggerating the peril&quot;.

Dan van der Vat suggests that, unlike the US, or Canada and Britain&#x27;s other dominions, which were protected by oceanic distances, Britain was at the end of the transatlantic supply route closest to German bases; for Britain it was a lifeline. It is this which led to Churchill&#x27;s concerns. Coupled with a series of major convoy battles in the space of a month, it undermined confidence in the convoy system in March 1943, to the point Britain considered abandoning it, not realising the U-boat had already effectively been defeated. These were &quot;over-pessimistic threat assessments&quot;, Blair concludes: &quot;At no time did the German U-boat force ever come close to winning the Battle of the Atlantic or bringing on the collapse of Great Britain&quot;.

==Shipping and U-boat sinkings each month==


Historians disagree about the relative importance of the anti-U-boat measures. Max Hastings states that &quot;In 1941 alone, Ultra [breaking the German code] saved between 1.5 and two million tons of Allied ships from destruction.&quot; This would be a 40 per cent to 53 per cent reduction. A history based on the German archives written for the British Admiralty after the war by a former U-boat commander and son-in-law of Dönitz reports that several detailed investigations to discover whether their operations were compromised by broken code were negative and that their defeat &quot;.. was due firstly to outstanding developments in enemy radar ...&quot; The graphs of the data are colour coded to divide the battle into three epochs before the breaking of the Enigma code, after it was broken, and after the introduction of centimetric radar, which could reveal submarine conning towers above the surface of the water and even detect periscopes. Obviously this subdivision of the data ignores many other defensive measures the Allies developed during the war, so interpretation must be constrained. Codebreaking by itself did not decrease the losses, which continued to rise ominously. More U-boats were sunk, but the number operational had more than tripled. After the improved radar came into action shipping losses plummeted, reaching a level significantly (p=0.99) below the early months of the war. The development of the improved radar by the Allies began in 1940, before the United States entered the war, when Henry Tizard and A. V. Hill won permission to share British secret research with the Americans, including bringing them a cavity magnetron, which generates the needed high-frequency radio waves. All sides will agree with Hastings that &quot;... mobilization of the best civilian brains, and their integration into the war effort at the highest levels, was an outstanding British success story.&quot;

<doc id="57766" wikidata="Q466605" url="?curid=57766" title="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory">
<text>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a 1964 children&#x27;s novel by British author Roald Dahl. The story features the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka.

The story was originally inspired by Roald Dahl&#x27;s experience of chocolate companies during his schooldays at Repton School in Derbyshire. Cadbury would often send test packages to the schoolchildren in exchange for their opinions on the new products. At that time (around the 1920s), Cadbury and Rowntree&#x27;s were England&#x27;s two largest chocolate makers and they each often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies, posing as employees, into the other&#x27;s factory—inspiring Dahl&#x27;s idea for the recipe-thieving spies (such as Wonka&#x27;s rival Slugworth) depicted in the book. Because of this, both companies became highly protective of their chocolate-making processes. It was a combination of this secrecy and the elaborate, often gigantic, machines in the factory that inspired Dahl to write the story.

&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; is frequently ranked among the most popular works in children&#x27;s literature. In 2012, Charlie Bucket brandishing a Golden Ticket appeared in a Royal Mail first class stamp in the UK. The novel was first published in the U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. in 1964 and in the U.K. by George Allen &amp; Unwin 11 months later. The book&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot;, was written by Dahl in 1971 and published in 1972. Dahl had also planned to write a third book in the series but never finished it. 

The book has also been adapted into two major motion pictures: &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; in 2005. A stand-alone film exploring Willy Wonka&#x27;s origins titled &quot;Wonka&quot; was released in 2023. The book has spawned a media franchise with multiple video games, theatrical productions and merchandise. 

==Plot==
10-year-old Charlie Bucket lives in poverty with his parents and grandparents in a town which is home to a world-famous chocolate factory. One day, Charlie&#x27;s bedridden Grandpa Joe tells him about Willy Wonka, the factory&#x27;s eccentric owner, and all of his fantastical candies. Rival chocolatiers sent in spies to steal his recipes, forcing Wonka to close the factory and disappear. He reopened the factory years later, but the gates remain locked, and nobody knows who is providing the factory with its workforce.

The next day, the newspaper announces that Wonka has hidden five Golden Tickets in Wonka Bars; the finders of these tickets will be invited to come and tour the factory. The first four tickets are found by gluttonous Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, compulsive gum-chewer Violet Beauregarde, and television addict Mike Teavee. One day, Charlie buys two Wonka Bars with some money he found in the snow. When he opens the second, Charlie discovers that the second bar he bought contains the fifth and final ticket. Upon hearing the news, Grandpa Joe regains his mobility and volunteers to accompany Charlie to the factory.

On the day of the tour, Wonka welcomes the five children and their parents inside the factory, a wonderland of confectionery creations that defy logic. They also meet the Oompa-Loompas, a race of impish humanoids who help him operate the factory as a thanks for his rescuing them from a land of dangerous monsters. During the tour, the other children besides Charlie give in to their impulses and are ejected from the tour in darkly comical ways: Augustus falls into the Chocolate River and is sucked up a pipe, Violet turns blue and inflates into a giant human blueberry after chewing an experimental stick of three-course dinner gum ending with a blueberry pie flavor, Veruca and her parents fall down a garbage chute after the former tries to capture one of the nut-testing squirrels, and Mike is shrunk down to the size of a chocolate bar after misusing a machine that sends chocolate by television despite Wonka&#x27;s warnings. The Oompa-Loompas sing about the children&#x27;s misbehaviour each time disaster strikes.

With only Charlie remaining, Wonka congratulates him for &quot;winning&quot; the factory. Wonka explains that the whole tour was designed to help him find a worthy heir to his business, and Charlie was the only child whose inherent genuineness passed the test. They ride the Great Glass Elevator and watch the other four children leave the factory before flying to Charlie&#x27;s house, where Wonka invites the entire Bucket family to come and live with him in the factory.

== Publication ==

===Race, editing, and censorship===

Dahl&#x27;s widow said that Charlie was originally written as &quot;a little black boy though this thought to be a falsehood.&quot; Dahl&#x27;s biographer said the change to a white character was driven by Dahl&#x27;s agent, who thought a black Charlie would not appeal to readers.

In the first published edition, the Oompa-Loompas were described as African pygmies, and were drawn this way in the original printed edition. After the announcement of a film adaptation sparked a statement from the NAACP, which expressed concern that the transportation of Oompa-Loompas to Wonka&#x27;s factory resembled slavery, Dahl found himself sympathising with their concerns and published a revised edition. In this edition, as well as the subsequent sequel, the Oompa-Loompas were drawn as being white and appearing similar to hippies, and the references to Africa were deleted.

In 2023, publisher Puffin made more than eighty additional changes to the original text of the book, such as: removing every occurrence of the word &quot;fat&quot; (including referring to Augustus Gloop as &quot;enormous&quot; rather than &quot;enormously fat&quot; and greatly changing the words of his song); removing most references to the Oompa-Loompa&#x27;s diminutive size and physical appearance and omitting descriptions of them living in trees and wearing deerskins and leaves; removing or changing the words &quot;mad&quot;, &quot;crazy&quot;, and &quot;queer&quot;; omitting many references to Mike Teavee&#x27;s toy guns; and removing references to corporal punishment (such as changing &quot;She needs a really good spanking&quot; to &quot;She needs a really good talking to&quot; and &quot;She wants a good kick in the pants&quot; to &quot;She needs to learn some manners&quot;).

===Unused chapters===
Various unused and draft material from Dahl&#x27;s early versions of the novel have been found. In the initial, unpublished drafts of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; nine golden tickets were distributed to tour Willy Wonka&#x27;s secret chocolate factory and the children faced more rooms and more temptations to test their self-control. Some of the names of the children cut from the final work include: 
* Clarence Crump, Bertie Upside, and Terence Roper (who overindulge in &quot;Warming Candies&quot;)
* Elvira Entwhistle (lost down a rubbish chute, renamed Veruca Salt)
* Violet Glockenberry (renamed Strabismus and finally Beauregarde) 
* Miranda Grope and Augustus Pottle (lost up a chocolate pipe, combined into the character Augustus Gloop) 
* Miranda Mary Piker (renamed from Miranda Grope, became the subject of &quot;Spotty Powder&quot;) 
* Marvin Prune (a conceited boy involved in &quot;The Children&#x27;s-Delight Room&quot;)
* Wilbur Rice and Tommy Troutbeck, the subjects of &quot;The Vanilla Fudge Room&quot;
* Herpes Trout (renamed Mike Teavee)

====&quot;Spotty Powder&quot;====
&quot;Spotty Powder&quot; was first published as a short story in 1973. In 1998, it was included in the children&#x27;s horror anthology &quot;Scary! Stories That Will Make You Scream&quot; edited by Peter Haining. The brief note before the story described the story as having been left out of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; due to an already brimming number of misbehaving children characters in the tale. In 2005, &quot;The Times&quot; reprinted &quot;Spotty Powder&quot; as a &quot;lost&quot; chapter, saying that it had been found in Dahl&#x27;s desk, written backwards in mirror writing (the same way that Leonardo da Vinci wrote in his journals). Spotty Powder looks and tastes like sugar, but causes bright red pox-like spots to appear on faces and necks five seconds after ingestion, so children who eat Spotty Powder do not have to go to school. The spots fade on their own a few hours later. After learning the purpose of Spotty Powder, the humourless, smug Miranda Piker and her equally humourless father (a schoolmaster) are enraged and disappear into the Spotty Powder room to sabotage the machine. Soon after entering, they are heard making what Mrs. Piker interprets as screams. Mr. Wonka assures her (after making a brief joke where he claims that headmasters are one of the occasional ingredients) that it is only laughter. Exactly what happens to them is not revealed in the extract.

In an early draft, sometime after being renamed from Miranda Grope to Miranda Piker, but before &quot;Spotty Powder&quot; was written, she falls down the chocolate waterfall and ends up in the Peanut-Brittle Mixer. This results in the &quot;rude and disobedient little kid&quot; becoming &quot;quite delicious.&quot; This early draft poem was slightly rewritten as an Oompa-Loompa song in the lost chapter, which now puts her in the &quot;Spotty-Powder mixer&quot; and instead of being &quot;crunchy and ... good [peanut brittle]&quot; she is now &quot;useful [for truancy] and ... good.&quot;

====&quot;The Vanilla Fudge Room&quot;====
In 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; revealed that Dahl had removed another chapter (&quot;The Vanilla Fudge Room&quot;) from an early draft of the book. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported the now-eliminated passage was &quot;deemed too wild, subversive and insufficiently moral for the tender minds of British children almost 50 years ago.&quot; In what was originally chapter five in that version of the book, Charlie goes to the factory with his mother instead of Grandpa Joe as originally published. At this point, the chocolate factory tour is down to eight kids, including Tommy Troutbeck and Wilbur Rice. After the entire group climbs to the top of the titular fudge mountain, eating vanilla fudge along the way, Troutbeck and Rice decide to take a ride on the wagons carrying away chunks of fudge. The wagons take them directly to the Pounding And Cutting Room, where the fudge is reformed and sliced into small squares for retail sale. Wonka states the machine is equipped with &quot;a large wire strainer ... which is used specially for catching children before they fall into the machine&quot; adding that &quot;It always catches them. At least it always has up to now.&quot;

The chapter dates back to an early draft with ten golden tickets, including one each for Miranda Grope and Augustus Pottle, who fell into the chocolate river prior to the events of &quot;Fudge Mountain&quot;. Augustus Pottle was routed to the Chocolate Fudge Room, not the Vanilla Fudge Room explored in this chapter, and Miranda Grope ended up in the Fruit and Nuts Room.

====&quot;The Warming Candy Room&quot;====
Also in 2014, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published a plot summary of &quot;The Warming Candy Room&quot;, wherein three boys eat too many &quot;warming candies&quot; and end up &quot;bursting with heat.&quot;

The Warming Candy Room is dominated by a boiler, which heats a scarlet liquid. The liquid is dispensed one drop at a time, where it cools and forms a hard shell, storing the heat and &quot;by a magic process ... the hot heat changes into an amazing thing called &#x27;cold heat.&#x27;&quot; After eating a single warming candy, one could stand naked in the snow comfortably. This is met with predictable disbelief from Clarence Crump, Bertie Upside, and Terence Roper, who proceed to eat at least 100 warming candies each, resulting in profuse perspiration. The three boys and their families discontinue the tour after they are taken to cool off &quot;in the large refrigerator for a few hours.&quot;

====&quot;The Children&#x27;s-Delight Room&quot;====
Dahl originally planned for a child called Marvin Prune to be included. He submitted the excised chapter regarding Prune to &quot;The Horn Book Review&quot; in the early 1970s. Rather than publish the chapter, &quot;Horn Book&quot; responded with a critical essay by novelist Eleanor Cameron, who called &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; “one of the most tasteless books ever written for children”.

==Reception==

In a 2006 list for the Royal Society of Literature, author J. K. Rowling (author of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books) named &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; among her top ten books that every child should read. A fan of the book since childhood, film director Tim Burton wrote: &quot;I responded to &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; because it respected the fact that children can be adults.&quot;

A 2004 study found that it was a common read-aloud book for fourth-graders in schools in San Diego County, California. A 2012 survey by the University of Worcester determined that it was one of the most common books that UK adults had read as children, after &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, and &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;.

Groups who have praised the book include:
* New England Round Table of Children&#x27;s Librarians Award (US, 1972)
* Surrey School Award (UK, 1973)
* Read Aloud BILBY Award (Australia, 1992)
* Millennium Children&#x27;s Book Award (UK, 2000)
* The Big Read, ranked number 35 in a BBC survey of the British public to identify the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Best-loved Novel&quot; (UK, 2003)
* National Education Association, listed as one of &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot; based on a poll (US, 2007)
* &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, ranked 61 among all-time children&#x27;s novels (US, 2012)

In the 2012 survey published by &quot;SLJ&quot;, a monthly with primarily US audience, &quot;Charlie&quot; was the second of four books by Dahl among their Top 100 Chapter Books, one more than any other writer. &quot;Time&quot; magazine in the US included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time; it was one of three Dahl novels on the list, more than any other author. In 2016 the novel topped the list of Amazon&#x27;s best-selling children&#x27;s books by Dahl in Print and on Kindle. In 2023, the novel was ranked by BBC at no. 18 in their poll of &quot;The 100 greatest children&#x27;s books of all time&quot;.

Although the book has always been popular and considered a children&#x27;s classic by many literary critics, a number of prominent individuals have spoken unfavourably of the novel over the years. Children&#x27;s novelist and literary historian John Rowe Townsend has described the book as &quot;fantasy of an almost literally nauseating kind&quot; and accused it of &quot;astonishing insensitivity&quot; regarding the original portrayal of the Oompa-Loompas as African black pygmies, although Dahl did revise this in later editions. Another novelist, Eleanor Cameron, compared the book to the sweets that form its subject matter, commenting that it is &quot;delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare.&quot;
Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in support of this assessment in a letter to &quot;The Horn Book Review&quot;, saying that her own daughter would turn &quot;quite nasty&quot; upon finishing the book. Dahl responded to Cameron&#x27;s criticisms by noting that the classics that she had cited would not be well received by contemporary children.

==Adaptations==

&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; has frequently been adapted for other media, including games, radio, the screen, and stage, most often as plays or musicals for children – often titled &quot;Willy Wonka&quot; or &quot;Willy Wonka, Jr.&quot; and almost always featuring musical numbers by all the main characters (Wonka, Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Violet, Veruca, etc.); many of the songs are revised versions from the 1971 film.

===Film===
The book was first made into a feature film as a musical, titled &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971), directed by Mel Stuart, produced by David L. Wolper, and starring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, character actor Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, and Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket, with music by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley. Dahl was credited for writing the screenplay, but David Seltzer was brought in by Stuart and Wolper to make changes against Dahl&#x27;s wishes, leaving his original adaptation, in one critic&#x27;s opinion, &quot;scarcely detectable&quot;. Amongst other things, Dahl was unhappy with the foregrounding of Wonka over Charlie, and disliked the musical score. Because of this, Dahl disowned the film. The film had an estimated budget of $2.9 million but grossed only $4 million and was considered a box-office disappointment, though it received positive reviews from critics. Home video and DVD sales, as well as repeated television airings, resulted in the film subsequently becoming a cult classic. Concurrently with the 1971 film, the Quaker Oats Company introduced a line of candies whose marketing uses the book&#x27;s characters and imagery.

Warner Bros. and the Dahl estate reached an agreement in 1998 to produce another film version of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, with the Dahl family receiving total artistic control. The project languished in development hell until Tim Burton signed on to direct in 2003. The film, titled &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, starred Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. It was released in 2005 to positive reviews and massive box office returns, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year.

In October 2016, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to the Willy Wonka character from the Roald Dahl Estate and would be planning a new film centered on the eccentric character with David Heyman producing. In February 2018, Paul King entered final negotiations to direct the film. In May 2021, it was reported that the film would be a musical titled &quot;Wonka&quot;, with Timothée Chalamet playing a younger version of the titular character in an origin story. King was confirmed as director and co-writer along with comedian Simon Farnaby; the film was released globally in December 2023.

===Other adaptations===
*In 1983, the BBC produced an adaptation for Radio 4. Titled &quot;Charlie&quot;, it aired in seven episodes between 6 February and 20 March.
*Also in 1983, a miniseries titled &quot;Kalle Och Chokladfabriken&quot; was aired on Swedish television. The series consisted of highly-detailed static illustrations that were accompanied by an unseen narrator reading an adapted translation of the novel, in a manner similar to the BBC television series &quot;Jackanory&quot;. 
*In 1985, the &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; video game was released for the ZX Spectrum by developer Soft Options and publisher Hill MacGibbon.

* A video game, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, based on Burton&#x27;s adaptation, was released on 11 July 2005.
*On 1 April 2006, the British theme park Alton Towers opened a family attraction themed around the story. The ride featured a boat section, where guests travel around the chocolate factory in bright pink boats on a chocolate river. In the final stage of the ride, guests enter one of two glass elevators, where they join Willy Wonka as they travel around the factory, eventually shooting up and out through the glass roof. Running for nine years, the ride was closed for good at the end of the 2015 season.
*The Estate of Roald Dahl sanctioned an operatic adaptation called &quot;The Golden Ticket&quot;. It was written by American composer Peter Ash and British librettist Donald Sturrock. &quot;The Golden Ticket&quot; has completely original music and was commissioned by American Lyric Theater, Lawrence Edelson (producing artistic director), and Felicity Dahl. The opera received its world premiere at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis on 13 June 2010, in a co-production with American Lyric Theater and Wexford Festival Opera.
*A musical based on the novel, titled &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, premiered at the West End&#x27;s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in May 2013 and officially opened on 25 June. The show was directed by Sam Mendes, with new songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, and stars Douglas Hodge as Willy Wonka. The production broke records for weekly ticket sales.
*In July 2017, an animated film &quot;Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was released in which the titular cat and mouse were put into the story of the 1971 film.
*On 27 November 2018, Netflix was revealed to be developing an &quot;animated series event&quot; based on Roald Dahl&#x27;s books, which will include a television series based on &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; and the novel&#x27;s sequel &quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot;. On 5 March 2020, it was reported that Taika Waititi will write, direct, and executive-produce both the series and a spin-off animated series focused on the Oompa Loompas.
*In 2021, Melbourne based comedians Big Big Big released a six part podcast called &quot;The Candyman&quot; that satirically presents events at the chocolate factory in a true crime genre.
*An unlicensed attraction, &quot;Willy’s Chocolate Experience&quot;, opened on 24 February 2024 in Glasgow, and closed within a day. The event was advertised using highly misleading AI-generated artwork, promising features such as &quot;an enchanted garden, an Imagination Lab, a Twilight Tunnel, and captivating entertainment&quot;, though instead contained a low-effort mock-up of a chocolate factory in a mostly empty warehouse. The event spawned many internet memes, and featured factory tours offered by several actors playing Willy Wonka, that involved a story in which Wonka would defeat an &quot;evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls&quot; called &quot;The Unknown&quot;. According to actor Paul Connell, who portrayed Willy Wonka in the tours, his script contained &quot;15 pages of AI-generated gibberish&quot;. Despite the high entrance fee and promised chocolate theme of the event, guests were only given a single jellybean and a cup of lemonade, and the misleading advertisements led to the police being called to the event shortly prior to it being shut down.

===Animated series===
On 27 November 2018, Netflix and The Roald Dahl Story Company jointly announced that Netflix would be producing an animated series based on Dahl&#x27;s books, including &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;Matilda&quot;, &quot;The BFG&quot;, &quot;The Twits&quot;, and other titles. Production commenced on the first of the Netflix Dahl animated series in 2019. On 5 March 2020, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Taika Waititi was partnering with Netflix on a pair of animated series — one based on the world of &quot;&#x27;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; and another based on the Oompa-Loompa characters. “The shows will retain the quintessential spirit and tone of the original story while building out the world and characters far beyond the pages of the Dahl book for the very first time,” Netflix said. On 23 February 2022, Mikros Animation revealed that they would be producing a new collaboration with Netflix. The collaboration was announced as &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. The long-format animated event series is based on the 1964 novel and is written, directed and executive produced by Waititi.

==Audiobook==
The book has been recorded a number of times:
* Roald Dahl himself narrated an abridged version of the book in 1975 for Caedmon Records (CDL 51476).
* In 2002, Monty Python member Eric Idle narrated the audiobook version of the American Edition of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; on Harper Childrens Audio ().
* In 2004, James Bolam narrated an abridged recording of the story for Puffin Audiobooks ().
* Douglas Hodge, who played Willy Wonka in the London production of the stage musical, narrated the UK Edition of the audiobook for Penguin Audio in 2013 (), and the title was later released on Audible.

===50th anniversary cover controversy===
The cover photo of the 50th anniversary edition, published by Penguin Modern Classics for sale in the UK and aimed at the adult market, received widespread commentary and criticism. The cover is a photo of a heavily made up young girl seated on her mother&#x27;s knee and wearing a doll-like expression, taken by the photographers Sofia Sanchez and Mauro Mongiello as part of a photo shoot for a 2008 fashion article in a French magazine, for a fashion article titled &quot;Mommie Dearest.&quot; In addition to writing that &quot;the image seemingly has little to do with the beloved children&#x27;s classic&quot;, reviewers and commentators in social media (such as posters on the publisher&#x27;s Facebook page) have said the art evokes &quot;Lolita&quot;, &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, and JonBenet Ramsey; looks like a scene from &quot;Toddlers &amp; Tiaras&quot;; and is &quot;misleading,&quot; &quot;creepy,&quot; &quot;sexualised,&quot; &quot;grotesque,&quot; &quot;misjudged on every level,&quot; &quot;distasteful and disrespectful to a gifted author and his work,&quot; &quot;pretentious,&quot; &quot;trashy&quot;, &quot;outright inappropriate,&quot; &quot;terrifying,&quot; &quot;really obnoxious,&quot; and &quot;weird &amp; kind of paedophilic.&quot;

The publisher explained its objective in a blog post accompanying the announcement about the jacket art: &quot;This new image . . . looks at the children at the center of the story, and highlights the way Roald Dahl’s writing manages to embrace both the light and the dark aspects of life.&quot; Additionally, Penguin Press&#x27;s Helen Conford told the Bookseller: &quot;We wanted something that spoke about the other qualities in the book. It&#x27;s a children&#x27;s story that also steps outside children&#x27;s and people aren&#x27;t used to seeing Dahl in that way.&quot; She continued: &quot;[There is] a lot of ill feeling about it, I think because it&#x27;s such a treasured book and a book which isn&#x27;t really a &#x27;crossover book&#x27;&quot; As she acknowledged: &quot;People want it to remain as a children&#x27;s book.&quot;

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; describes what it calls this &quot;strangely but tellingly misbegotten&quot; cover design thusly: &quot;The image is a photograph, taken from a French fashion shoot, of a glassy-eyed, heavily made-up little girl. Behind her sits, a mother figure, stiff and coiffed, casting an ominous shadow. The girl, with her long, perfectly waved platinum-blond hair and her pink feather boa, looks like a pretty and inert doll—&quot; The article continues: &quot;And if the Stepford daughter on the cover is meant to remind us of Veruca Salt or Violet Beauregarde, she doesn&#x27;t: those badly behaved squirts are bubbling over with rude life.&quot; Moreover, writes Talbot, &quot;The Modern Classics cover has not a whiff of this validation of childish imagination; instead, it seems to imply a deviant adult audience.&quot;

<text>The Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) is the principal organizing body of women&#x27;s professional tennis. The association governs the WTA Tour, which is the worldwide professional tennis tour for women, and was founded to create a better future for women&#x27;s tennis. The WTA&#x27;s corporate headquarters is in St. Petersburg, Florida, with its European headquarters in London and its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Beijing.

The Women&#x27;s Tennis Association was founded in June 1973 by Billie Jean King, and traces its origins to the inaugural Virginia Slims tournament, arranged by Gladys Heldman, sponsored by Joe Cullman, CEO of Philip Morris, and held on 23 September 1970 at the Houston Racquet Club in Houston, Texas. Rosie Casals won this first event.

When the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association was founded, Billie Jean King was one of nine players that comprised the WTA, also referred to as the Original 9, that included Julie Heldman, Valerie Ziegenfuss, Judy Dalton, Kristy Pigeon, Peaches Bartkowicz, Kerry Melville Reid, Nancy Richey, and Rosie Casals. Today, the WTA has more than 2,500 players from nearly 100 countries competing for $146 million in prize money.

==Early history==
Tennis&#x27;s Open Era, in which professional players were allowed to compete alongside amateurs, began in 1968. Billie Jean King was a high ranking tennis player in the late 1960s who won several titles and was interviewed in the media. The first Open Tournament was the British Hard Court Championships in Bournemouth. Later that year at the first Open Wimbledon, the prize fund difference was 2.5:1 in favor of men. King won £750 for taking the title, while Rod Laver won £2,000. The total purses of both competitions were £14,800 for men and £5,680 for women. Confusion also reigned as no one knew how many Open Tournaments there were supposed to be. The tournaments that did not want to provide prize money eventually faded out of the calendar, including the US Eastern Grass Court circuit with stops at Merion Cricket Club and Essex county club.

There were two professional tennis circuits in existence at the start of the Open Era: World Championship Tennis (WCT), which was for men only, and the National Tennis League (NTL). Ann Jones, Rosie Casals, Françoise Dürr, and Billie Jean King joined NTL. King was paid $40,000 a year, Jones was paid $25,000, and Casals and Durr were paid $20,000 each. The group played established tournaments, such as the US Open and Wimbledon. But the group also organised their own tournaments, playing in the South of France for two months. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) then imposed several sanctions on the group: the women were not allowed to play in the Wightman Cup in 1968 and 1969 and the USLTA refused to include Casals and King in their rankings for those years.

By the 1970s the pay differential had increased. King said &quot;Promoters were making more money than women. Male tennis players were making more money. Everybody was making more money except the women&quot;. In 1969, ratios of 5:1 in terms of pay between men and women were common at smaller tournaments. By 1970 these figures had increased to up to 12:1.

Billie Jean King and Cynthia Starr wrote in their book, &quot;We Have Come a Long Way&quot;, in 1988, &quot;The women were being squeezed financially because we had no control in a male-dominated sport. Men owned, ran and promoted the tournaments, and because many of them were former players themselves, their sympathies lay with the male players, who argued vociferously that most of the money should be theirs.&quot; The low point in women&#x27;s pay inequality came before the US Open in 1970. The Pacific Southwest Championships directed by Jack Kramer, had announced a 12:1 ratio in the prize money difference between what males and females would win. This tournament provoked the top 9 woman tennis players to take a stand for equality. &quot;These woman became known as the Original 9&quot;. They did not play in the Los Angeles tournament and instead wanted to create their own tennis tournament.

Several female players contacted Gladys Heldman, publisher of &quot;World Tennis Magazine&quot;, and stated that they wanted to boycott the event. Although Heldman advised against it, she did help them put together their own tournament in Houston which would not take place until after the US Open. The 1970 Houston Women&#x27;s Invitation for nine women players was formed. Heldman was friends with Joseph Cullman, CEO and chairman of Phillip Morris, who secured the new tournament. The tournament was a success and the women found footing, &quot;so, at the bidding of the Original 9, Heldman – who had secured backing from Philip Morris&#x27;s Virginia Slims cigarette brand for her Houston Invitational – went back to her friend, Philip Morris chairman Joe Cullman III, to see if the company would support a circuit of some kind. Delighted by the publicity splash from Houston, Cullman was only too keen to give the women what they needed: financial backing, to the tune of a quarter of a million dollars, and the Virginia Slims name as title sponsor for a circuit in 1971.&quot;

The International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) began dropping several women&#x27;s competitions from the tournaments it presided over. For example, in 1970, the ILTF sanctioned 15 men-only tournaments, all of which had previously been combined events. The Toyota International Series , which would later absorb the ILTF Women&#x27;s Grand Prix circuit, and later merge with the Virginia Slims World Championship Series eventually become the WTA World Tour in 1990. The circuit was composed of 19 tournaments, all based in the United States (one in Puerto Rico), and prize money totalled $309,100.

In 1973 the US Open tennis tournament became the first Grand Slam tournament to award the same prize money for women as men. The Australian Open would become the second Grand Slam offering equal prize money following suit in 1985 although the tournament awarded men more money from 1996 to 2000 before equal prize money returned in 2001. The French Open offered equal prize money for champions in 2006. In 2007 both Wimbledon and the French Open both offered equal prize money.

The WTA Tour sold television rights of all its tournaments as a single package, reaching large audiences around the world. &quot;The &#x27;80s energized the popularity base, taking tennis out of country clubs and landed estates into public parks and arenas. It became a sport, in contrast to an amenable pastime.&quot;

&quot;From those first steps in Houston in 1970 to the current WTA Tour, with tournaments in 33 countries and total prize money of $139 million (in 2018); from a prize pot 10 times lower than the men at the Grand Slams in 1970 to parity in 2007 and ever since, women&#x27;s tennis has become (almost) the equal of its male counterpart. And they did it themselves, which also explains why their governance is still independent today.&quot;

==WTA Tour==

The WTA was founded at a meeting organised by Billie Jean King, a week before the 1973 Wimbledon Championships. This meeting was held at Gloucester Hotel in London. In 1975, the WTA increased its financial stature by signing a television broadcast contract with CBS, the first in the WTA&#x27;s history. Further financial developments ensued. In 1976, Colgate assumed sponsorship of the circuit from April to November. In 1979, Avon replaced Virginia Slims as the sponsor of the winter circuit, and in its first year offered the largest prize fund for a single tournament, $100,000 for the Avon Championships, in the WTA tennis history. The &quot;Colgate Series&quot;, renamed the &quot;Toyota Series&quot; in 1981, included tournaments in all parts of the world, whereas the Avon sponsored events took place solely in the US. The two circuits merged beginning with the 1983 season, when Virginia Slims returned to take full sponsorship rights of the WTA Tour. Every tournament under the administration of the WTA now became part of the &quot;Virginia Slims World Championships Series&quot;.

In all, Virginia Slims (Philip Morris) sponsored women&#x27;s tennis from 1970 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1994. The sponsored has received such criticism as the following from the Stanford [University] Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising: &quot;Virginia Slims cleverly sponsored the WTA Tour Championships at the time to increase connections between cigarettes and healthy female athletes.&quot;

In 1977, women&#x27;s tennis was the first professional sport opened to transgender women. The New York Supreme Court ruled in favour of Renée Richards, a player who underwent male-to-female sex reassignment surgery. Eligibility of transgender players is officially regulated under the current WTA official rulebook.

In April 1977, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; published an article entitled &quot;Social Variety Is Slim on Women&#x27;s Tennis Tour&quot; which looked at some of the downside and difficulties faced by touring tennis pros, not unlike the problems of traveling musicians performing a whole series of tour dates and gigs. The article included the phrase &quot;comradeship that falls short of camaraderie&quot;, because fellow members were also competitors who usually felt they needed to maintain a certain amount of distance. One player was quoted as saying, &quot;But if you are not playing well, it is very hard.&quot;

In 1984, The Australian Open joined the US Open in offering women equal prize money, but temporarily did not between 1996 and 2000. After a 30-year campaign, 2007 marked the historic achievement of equal prize money at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. This meant all four major tournaments offered parity.

In 1995, the WTA Players Association merged with the Women&#x27;s Tennis Council to form the WTA Tour.

===Growth milestones===

The WTA circuit continued to expand during these years. In 1971, King became the first female athlete to surpass $100,000 in earnings for a single year. Chris Evert became the first female athlete to win over $1,000,000 in career earnings in 1976. By 1980, over 250 women were playing professionally, and the circuit consisted of 47 global events, offering a total of $7.2 million in prize money. These increased financial opportunities allowed for groundbreaking developments not only in tennis, but across women&#x27;s sports.

In 1982, Martina Navratilova became the first to win over $1,000,000 in a single year. Navratilova&#x27;s single year earnings exceeded $2 million in 1984. In 1997, Martina Hingis became the first to earn over $3 million during a single year. In 2003, Kim Clijsters surpassed $4 million in earnings for a single year. In 2006, Venus Williams and the WTA pushed for equal prize money at both the French Open and Wimbledon. Both of these Grand Slam events relented in 2007 and awarded equal money for the first time. This enabled Justine Henin, who won the French Open in 2007, to earn over $5 million that year, becoming the first woman in sports to do this. In 2009, Serena Williams went over the six million mark by earning over $6.5 million in a single year. Then in 2012 both Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka became the first players to exceed $7 million in prize money in a single season. In 2013 Serena Williams went over the twelve million dollar mark, winning $12,385,572 in a single year.

===Management===

American sports entrepreneur Jerry Diamond (1928–1996) served as executive director of the women&#x27;s association from 1974 to 1985. He was instrumental in negotiating business deals with Avon, Colgate-Palmolive, and Toyota, and worked out the deal that made Virginia Slims the titular sponsor of the WTA tour.

Larry Scott became chairman and CEO of the WTA on 16 April 2003. While at the WTA, Scott put together the largest sponsorship in the history of women&#x27;s sports, a six-year, $88 million sponsorship deal with Sony Ericsson. On 24 March 2009, Scott announced that he was resigning as WTA chief to take up a new position as the commissioner of the Pac-10 Conference, on 1 July 2009.

Scott pointed to Korn Ferry to headhunt his replacement but &quot;with no decision made&quot; on 13 July 2009, WTA Tour announced the appointment of Stacey Allaster, the Tour&#x27;s president since 2006, as the new chairman and CEO of the WTA. Allaster was named as one of the &quot;Most Powerful Women in Sports&quot; by Forbes Magazine and led the WTA through significant growth and under her leadership, she secured a media agreement that would maximise fan exposure to women&#x27;s tennis globally. During her time with the WTA, she generated an estimated $1 billion in diversified contract revenues, built the brand globally, and was a strong advocate for gender equality. She announced her retirement as chief executive of the WTA on 22 September 2015 citing a personal change in priorities.

On 5 October 2015, Steve Simon, the Tournament Director of the BNP Paribas Open, was announced to succeed Stacey as the new WTA chairman and CEO.

In December 2021, following Peng Shuai&#x27;s disappearance by the Chinese government, the WTA under Steve Simon suspended its operations in China and Hong Kong. The boycott was lifted in 2023 after 16 months, citing financial losses due to the suspension of operations in China as well as the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2022, medical technology firm Hologic reached an agreement to become title sponsor and &quot;official health partner&quot; of the WTA Tour, marking its first title sponsorship agreement since the expiration of the previous Sony Ericsson deal.

===WTA Tour tournaments===


WTA 125 tournaments (30) events

Since 2012 (number of events varies each year; in 2018 there were ten tournaments: four in United States, two in China and one each in Croatia, France, India and Taiwan), with prize money for the four events in United States at US$150,000 and at the other events at around US$125,000.

Ranking points are also available at tournaments on the ITF Women&#x27;s Circuit organized by the International Tennis Federation, which comprises several hundred tournaments each year with prize funds ranging from US$15,000 to US$100,000.

==Players&#x27; Council==
The Players&#x27; Council is a group or sub-committee under the WTA board of directors, consisting of eight selected players on the tour that advocate player interest, handles grievances, changes in the tennis schedule and other concerns.

<text>Clay County is a county in the east central part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census the population was 14,236. Its county seat is Ashland. Its name is in honor of Henry Clay, famous American statesman, member of the United States Senate from Kentucky and United States Secretary of State in the 19th century. It was the last dry county in Alabama with no wet cities within its boundaries, until a vote on March 1, 2016, approved the sale of alcohol in Lineville and Ashland.

==History==
Clay County was established on December 7, 1866, from land taken from Randolph and Talladega counties. Named after the famous statesman Henry Clay, the county seat itself was named after his estate in Lexington, Kentucky called &quot;Ashland&quot;. The county was covered with a heavy growth of trees, and a part of the territory was occupied by the Creek Indians. The early pioneers acquired the lands by government entry and the Indian lands by public auction. The families came wholly from Fayette County, Georgia. Clay County was formed for geographic reasons. The citizens of the area had a difficult time reaching the county seat of Wedowee in Randolph County because of the Tallapoosa River to the east. Talladega was difficult to reach because of the intervening mountains. Even today, Clay County is one of only three counties in Alabama to have no U.S. highways in its boundaries. Ashland was a mining center, particularly for graphite.

During the Desert Shield/Storm conflict, Clay County had more soldiers serving per capita than any other county in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashland/Clay County, Alabama&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Clay County is a county located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Florida along the west bank of the St. Johns River. As of 2020, the population was 218,245 and in 2023, that number increased to 232,439, making it the third largest county in the Jacksonville metropolitan area. While most of the county is unincorporated, there are 4 municipalities with Green Cove Springs being the county seat and the unincorporated Lakeside CDP being the largest place. It is named in honor of Henry Clay, a famous American statesman, member of the United States Senate from Kentucky, and United States Secretary of State in the 19th century.

Since 1990, Clay County has transformed into a largely suburban county with the third highest household median income in Florida behind neighboring St. Johns County and Santa Rosa County. This transformation has come as workers from Jacksonville, and to a smaller extent other nearby cities such as St. Augustine and Gainesville, have moved into newly built residential subdivisions. Over half of workers living in Clay County work in another county, which is the highest rate of any county in Florida. As such, the county has the third highest average commute time in the state at almost 33 minutes. With the population expected to surpass 300,000 residents by 2040, projects such as the First Coast Expressway are being constructed to alleviate chronic congestion on major roadways in the county such as Blanding Blvd and U.S. 17.

Clay County is known for its rich military history with major current and former installations such as Branan Air Field, Naval Air Station Green Cove Springs, and Camp Blanding all being located in the county. The county also attracts many tourists due to its abundance of natural water features. Many notable lakes such as Kingsley Lake, Lake Asbury, Doctors Lake, Lake Geneva, and Lake Brooklyn are all located in the county. Black Creek begins at the St. Johns River just north of Green Cove Springs and runs through the central portion of the county.

==History==

Early in the 19th century, Zephaniah Kingsley built his prosperous Laurel Grove Plantation, planting oranges and trading slaves, where Orange Park is today.

Clay County was created on December 31, 1858, from a section of Duval County. The area was once a popular destination for tourists because of its springs and mild climate. Steamboats brought them to various hotels in Green Cove Springs, such as the St. Elmo, Clarendon, and Oakland. President Grover Cleveland was the most prominent of such tourists and had spring water shipped to the White House. Clay County&#x27;s popularity among tourists peaked during the last three decades of the 19th century. Tourism later waned because of Henry Flagler&#x27;s extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to other destinations such as Palm Beach and Miami.

The military has also played an important role in Clay County history. In 1939, Camp Blanding opened on Kingsley Lake in southwest Clay County. The Florida National Guard developed this complex. During World War II, it trained over 90,000 troops and became the fourth-largest &quot;city&quot; in the state. In Green Cove Springs, Lee Field was a flight training center. After World War II, Lee Field became a base for the mothball fleet. Although Lee Field closed in the early 1960s, Camp Blanding continues to operate today as a base for military training. Clay County is also a popular choice of residence for military personnel stationed on bases in nearby Duval County (NAS Jacksonville, NS Mayport, and, before it closed, NAS Cecil Field).

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (6.1%) are covered by water.
The average elevation in Clay County is 95 feet above sea level with the highest point, located on the western border in Camp Blanding, being 259 feet. The southwestern portion of the county features many lakes which contribute to the Floridan Aquifer and are an important source of water for the surrounding region. During the 2000s, high growth rates in Northeast Florida caused many of the lakes to dry up as demand for water increased. To combat this, a project began in August 2022 to construct a pipeline from Black Creek in the central part of the county to Alligator Creek in Keystone Heights. This pipeline is expected to restore the water levels in the lakes to their former high points.

Clay County is home to Goldhead Branch State Park, Belmore State Forest, and Jennings State Forest. These protected areas provide critical habitat to many native species of plants and animals, as well as provide a buffer around Camp Blanding from surrounding development.

===Libraries===
The Clay County Public Library System consists of five branches:
* Green Cove Springs Library
* Headquarters Library (Fleming Island)
* Keystone Heights Library
* Middleburg-Clay Hill Library
* Orange Park Library

The first public library in Clay County was made up of a small collection established by the Village Improvement Association within the county. Other small libraries were established by other organizations within Clay County. In 1961, representatives from different women&#x27;s organizations in the county started a movement to establish a library system within the county, and resulted in the Clay County Board of County Commissioners beginning to set aside funds to create the county library system. Due to their efforts, the first public library in Clay County was opened in 1961 in Green Cove Springs. The Green Cove Springs Library purchased a bookmobile in 1962 and began to provide outreach services to different areas within Clay County that same year. In 1962 two more public libraries opened in Clay County, the Keystone Heights Library and the Orange Park Library. A fire destroyed the Keystone Heights Library in February 1962. The Keystone Heights Library was relocated to a new building in Theme Park in 1964. The Headquarters Library in Green Cove Springs became open to the public in 1970 after a population boom caused the need for a new library. In 1976, the Orange Park Library moved to a larger location within the town of Orange Park. The population growth experienced in the county during the late 1970s necessitated the development of the Middleburg-Clay Hill Library, which first opened in a storefront in the late 1970s. The permanent facility for this library was completed and opened to the public in 1986.

Since 1842, its county seat has been Louisville, in the center of the county&#x27;s area. In 1950, the U.S. Census Bureau placed the mean center of U.S. population in Clay County.

==History==
The future Clay County had been inhabited for thousands of years by the Illiniwek Indians (the remains of an Indian village&#x27;s burial ground are still visible west of Ingraham). White explorers used or cleared a trail between the future settlements of Saint Louis in Missouri, to Vincennes in Indiana; this became a mail route in 1805. The first white settler (McCauley, from Kentucky) built a cabin in 1809 near this road at its intersection with a trail from Vandalia to Mt. Carmel. He was driven out by the Indians, but had returned by 1819, by which time other cabins had been constructed in the area, which was originally called Habbardsville. The Indians were removed from the area in 1828.

Clay County was authorized by act of the state legislature on December 23, 1824, by partitioning portions of Wayne, Crawford, and Fayette counties. It was named for American statesman Henry Clay, a member of the United States Senate from Kentucky and United States Secretary of State. Clay was a candidate for president in 1824.

The first appointed commissioners met on March 8, 1825, to organize the county government. Land for county building purposes was donated near Habbardsville. The commissioners accepted the offer, renamed it Maysville, and had a two-room courthouse erected on the property by the end of the year. The seat remained at that location (about a mile south of the present community of Clay City) through 1841, and in 1842 the county government began functioning in Louisville, being at the center of the county&#x27;s area.

The first railroad line through Clay County was laid between 1850 and 1854, the Ohio and Mississippi Line. By 1855–56, the Illinois Central Railroad had also been constructed across the northwest corner of the county.

==Geography==

The low rolling hills of Clay County are devoted to agricultural production. The various drainage areas are still largely wooded. The Little Wabash River flows southeastward through the center of the county, while Muddy Creek drains the eastern portion (the meanders of Little Muddy delineate a portion of the county&#x27;s east border with Richland County). Buck Creek, in the south part of the county, flows eastward and joins the Little Wabash above Clay City. Raccoon Creek flows southeastward from the lower part of the county into Wayne County. The highest point on the terrain ( ASL) is a small point along the western border with Marion County.

The county produced excellent timber during the nineteenth century, and some sandstone and limestone. The soil is light and not considered adapted to farming on a large scale.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

<text>Clay County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas. Its county seat and most populous city is Clay Center. As of the 2020 United States census, the county population was 8,117. The county was named for Henry Clay, an influential U.S. Senator from Kentucky.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1857, Clay County was established.

When the first counties were created by the Kansas legislature in 1855, the territory within the present limits of the county was attached to Riley County for all revenue and judicial purposes. Subsequently, Clay was attached to Geary County. In 1857, Clay was created and named in honor of the famous American statesman Henry Clay, a member of the United States Senate from Kentucky and United States Secretary of State in the 19th century.

In 1887, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (3 miles west of Strong City) to Superior, Nebraska. This branch line connected Strong City, Neva, Rockland, Diamond Springs, Burdick, Lost Springs, Jacobs, Hope, Navarre, Enterprise, Abilene, Talmage, Manchester, Longford, Oak Hill, Miltonvale, Aurora, Huscher, Concordia, Kackley, Courtland, Webber, Superior. At some point, the line from Neva to Lost Springs was pulled, but the right of way has not been abandoned. This branch line was originally called &quot;Strong City and Superior line&quot; but later the name was shortened to the &quot;Strong City line&quot;. In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed north to south through Clay County, with much controversy over tax exemption and environmental concerns (if a leak ever occurs). A pumping station named Riley was built along the pipeline.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.6%) is water.

==Government==

===Presidential elections===
Like all of Kansas outside the eastern cities, Clay County is overwhelmingly Republican. When Lyndon B. Johnson became in 1964 the last Democrat to carry the state&#x27;s electoral votes, Clay County was his weakest in the state, giving over 62 percent of its votes to Barry Goldwater. The solitary Democrat to win a majority of Clay County&#x27;s votes has been William Jennings Bryan in 1896, although Woodrow Wilson in a four-way race in 1912, and Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 both obtained slim pluralities. Roosevelt in 1936, when he lost to Kansan Alf Landon by eighty-four votes, remains the last Democrat to win forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote, and Jimmy Carter in 1976 is the last to pass thirty percent.

<text>Clay County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana. As of 2020, the population was 26,466. The county seat is Brazil. Clay County is included in the Terre Haute, Indiana, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Indiana Legislature mandated Clay County in 1825, with territory partitioned from Owen, Putnam, Sullivan, and Vigo counties. Its name honors Henry Clay, a famous antebellum American statesman.

The first Courthouse was built in the newly platted town of Bowling Green in 1828. It was a two-story structure of hand-hewn logs.

By the late 1830s Clay County had grown to the extent that the first Courthouse could no longer provide adequate facilities. Therefore, a second Courthouse was constructed near the first Courthouse. This two-story brick structure served until destroyed by fire on November 30, 1851.

By the 1860s the towns of Harmony, Knightsville, and Brazil were growing rapidly, due in part to their location along the National Road, and also because of the many coal companies in that area. An effort to move the county seat of government to a more central location, which had begun in the 1850s, grew stronger creating controversy among citizens. In the 1860s citizens in the northern section of Clay County became more organized in their efforts. In 1871 brothers Robert and John Stewart donated land along the National Road in Brazil for a new courthouse. $5,300 was also raised by citizens in the area to entice the commissioners to move the seat of government from Bowling Green to Brazil. This amount was reportedly the value of the existing courthouse and grounds, thus defusing opponents&#x27; argument that abandoning the present courthouse would be a waste of taxpayers money. The relocation efforts, which began in 1871, were challenged in the Supreme Court. The relocation was finally granted in 1876.

In 1912 John W. Gaddis, a prominent architect in Vincennes, Indiana, entered into a contract with the County Commissioners to design, plan, and oversee the construction of a new courthouse. The construction bid of W.H. Bailey and Charles A. Koemer of Louisville, Kentucky was accepted in 1912 with the cornerstone being laid in the fall of 1912. Gaddis had completed several others: in Fairfield and Robinson, Illinois: Perryville, Missouri and two in Indiana, the Putnam County Courthouse in Greencastle (1905) and the Huntington County Courthouse (1906) in Huntington, which are also in Classical Revival mode.

The Clay County Courthouse, built in 1913–1914, is one of the most historically and architecturally significant buildings in Brazil and Clay County, Indiana. Built in Classical Revival style of architecture, it is the only building in Clay County holding county government offices and records. It is also located alongside the famed National Road (Cumberland Trail). The present building is the fifth Clay County Courthouse.

<text>Clay County is a county in the U.S. state of Minnesota. As of the 2020 census, the population was 65,318. Its county seat is Moorhead. Clay County is part of the Fargo, ND-MN Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Clay County was established in 1860 as Breckinridge County, and named for John C. Breckinridge, vice president of the United States from 1857 to 1861. After the Civil War began, Breckinridge joined the Confederate Army and in March 1862 the state Legislature replaced the name of Breckinridge with that of Henry Clay (1777–1852), who like Breckinridge was from Lexington, Ky., and was known &quot;The Great Pacificator&quot; or &quot;The Great Compromiser&quot; who helped head off civil war at least twice. The county&#x27;s government was not organized until 1872, after the Northern Pacific Railway reached the area and settlement accelerated.

==Geography==

Clay County lies on the western side of Minnesota. Its western boundary line abuts the eastern boundary line of the state of North Dakota (across the Red River). The Red River flows northward along the western boundary line of the county, on its way to the Hudson Bay in Canada. The Buffalo River flows west-northwesterly through the center of the county, joined by the South Branch Buffalo River west of Glyndon, before discharging into the Red on the county&#x27;s western border near Georgetown. The terrain consists of rolling hills, dotted with lakes and ponds in its eastern portion. The terrain slopes to the west and north, with its highest point near the southeastern corner, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which are land and (0.7%) are covered by water.

<text>Clay County is located in the U.S. state of Missouri and is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the county had a population of 253,335, making it the fifth-most populous county in Missouri. Its county seat is Liberty. The county was organized January 2, 1822, and named in honor of U.S. Representative Henry Clay from Kentucky, later a member of the United States Senate and United States Secretary of State. Clay County contains many of the area&#x27;s northern suburbs, along with a substantial portion of the city of Kansas City, Missouri. It also owns and operates the Midwest National Air Center in Excelsior Springs.

==History==
Clay County was settled primarily from migrants from the Upper Southern states of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. They brought slaves and slaveholding traditions with them, and quickly started cultivating crops similar to those in Middle Tennessee and Kentucky: hemp and tobacco. Clay was one of several counties settled mostly by Southerners to the north and south of the Missouri River. Given their culture and traditions, this area became known as Little Dixie. In 1860, enslaved persons made up 25% or more of the county&#x27;s population.

The 1828 execution of Annice, a slave owned by Jeremiah Prior, was the first to occur in Clay County. She was also the first female slave executed in the state of Missouri.

Many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints found refuge in Clay County in November 1833 after they were driven from Jackson County, Missouri. In 1836, mobs and the Missouri State militia viciously drove the members of the church from the county. Leaders of this church, most notably Joseph Smith, were imprisoned for some months in Clay County in the jail at Liberty. In May 2012, the LDS Church built the Kansas City Missouri Temple six miles southwest of the Liberty Jail site at 7001 Searcy Creek Parkway in Kansas City, Missouri.

==Geography==

==Politics==
Clay County, like the rest of Missouri, has swung to the Republican Party in the 21st century, though the margins have been very close. In 2000, Al Gore famously won the county by one vote. The county, holding Kansas City, is mainly suburban in culture and remains competitive. In 2016, Donald Trump won the county while Hillary Clinton failed to improve on Barack Obama&#x27;s percentages with only 41% of the vote. Joe Biden, however, did improve on those margins, winning nearly 47% of the vote in 2020; Trump still carried the county by 4%.
