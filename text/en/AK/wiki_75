<text>Geoffrey of Monmouth (; ; ) was a Catholic cleric from Monmouth, Wales, and one of the major figures in the development of British historiography and the popularity of tales of King Arthur. He is best known for his chronicle &quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot; ( or &quot;&quot;) which was widely popular in its day, being translated into other languages from its original Latin. It was given historical credence well into the 16th century, but is now considered historically unreliable.

==Life and career ==
Geoffrey was born between about 1090 and 1100, in Wales or the Welsh Marches. He had reached the age of majority by 1129 when he is recorded as witnessing a charter.

Geoffrey refers to himself in his as (Geoffrey of Monmouth), which indicates a significant connection to Monmouth, Wales, and may refer to his birthplace. His works attest to some acquaintance with the place-names of the region. Geoffrey was known to his contemporaries as or variants thereof. The &quot;Arthur&quot; in these versions of his name may indicate the name of his father or a nickname based on his scholarly interests.

Earlier scholars assumed that Geoffrey was Welsh or at least spoke Welsh. His knowledge of this language appears to have been slight, however, and there is no evidence that he was of either Welsh or Cambro-Norman descent. He may have come from the same French-speaking elite of the Welsh border country as Gerald of Wales, Walter Map, and Robert, Earl of Gloucester, to whom Geoffrey dedicated versions of his &quot;History&quot;. Sir Frank Stenton and others have suggested that Geoffrey&#x27;s parents may have been among the many Bretons who took part in William the Conqueror&#x27;s conquest and settled in the southeast of Wales. Monmouth had been in the hands of Breton lords since 1075 or 1086, and the names {{lang|la|Galfridus}} and Arthur were more common among the Bretons than the Welsh.

He may have served for a while in the Benedictine Monmouth Priory, but most of his adult life appears to have been spent outside Wales. Between 1129 and 1151, his name appears on six charters in the Oxford area, sometimes styled {{lang|la|magister}} (teacher). He was probably a secular canon of St. George&#x27;s college. All the charters signed by Geoffrey are also signed by Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, a canon at that church. Another frequent co-signatory is Ralph of Monmouth, a canon of Lincoln.

Archbishop Theobald of Bec consecrated Geoffrey as Bishop of St Asaph at Lambeth on 24 February 1152, having ordained him a priest at Westminster 10 days before. According to Lewis Thorpe, &quot;There is no evidence that he ever visited his see, and indeed the wars of Owain Gwynedd make this most unlikely.&quot; He appears to have died between 25 December 1154 and 24 December 1155 according to Welsh chronicles, when his successor took office.

==Works==
Geoffrey&#x27;s structuring and shaping of the Merlin and Arthur myths engendered their vast popularity which continues today, and he is generally viewed by scholars as the major establisher of the Arthurian canon. The &quot;History&quot;&#x27;s effect on the legend of King Arthur was so vast that Arthurian works have been categorised as &quot;pre-Galfridian&quot; and &quot;post-Galfridian&quot;, depending on whether or not they were influenced by him.

=== &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; ===
Geoffrey wrote several works in Latin, the language of learning and literature in Europe during the medieval period. His major work was the {{Lang|la|Historia Regum Britanniae}} (&quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), the work best known to modern readers. It relates the purported history of Britain, from its first settlement by Brutus of Troy, a descendant of Trojan hero Aeneas, to the death of Cadwaladr in the 7th century, covering Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasions of Britain, Kings Leir and Cymbeline, and one of the earliest developed narratives of King Arthur.

Geoffrey claims in his dedication that the book is a translation of an &quot;ancient book in the British language that told in orderly fashion the deeds of all the kings of Britain&quot;, given to him by Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, but modern historians have dismissed this claim. It is likely, however, that the Archdeacon did furnish Geoffrey with some materials in the Welsh language which helped inspire his work, as Geoffrey&#x27;s position and acquaintance with him would not have permitted him to fabricate such a claim outright. Much of it is based on the &quot;Historia Britonum&quot;, a 9th-century Welsh-Latin historical compilation, Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, and Gildas&#x27;s 6th-century polemic {{Lang|la|De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae}}, expanded with material from bardic oral tradition and genealogical tracts, and embellished by Geoffrey&#x27;s own imagination. In an exchange of manuscript material for their own histories, Robert of Torigny gave Henry of Huntingdon a copy of &quot;History&quot;, which both Robert and Henry used uncritically as authentic history and subsequently used in their own works, by which means Geoffrey&#x27;s fictions became embedded in popular history.

&quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot; is now usually considered a literary forgery containing little reliable history. This has since led many modern scholars to agree with William of Newburgh, who wrote around 1190 that &quot;it is quite clear that everything this man wrote about Arthur and his successors, or indeed about his predecessors from Vortigern onwards, was made up, partly by himself and partly by others.&quot;

Other contemporaries were similarly unconvinced by Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;. For example, Giraldus Cambrensis recounts the experience of a man possessed by demons: &quot;If the evil spirits oppressed him too much, the Gospel of St John was placed on his bosom, when, like birds, they immediately vanished; but when the book was removed, and the &quot;History of the Britons&quot; by &#x27;Geoffrey Arthur&#x27; [as Geoffrey named himself] was substituted in its place, they instantly reappeared in greater numbers, and remained a longer time than usual on his body and on the book.&quot;

Geoffrey&#x27;s major work was nevertheless widely disseminated throughout medieval Western Europe; Acton Griscom listed 186 extant manuscripts in 1929, and others have been identified since. It enjoyed a significant afterlife in a variety of forms, including translations and adaptations such as Wace&#x27;s Old Norman-French &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;, Layamon&#x27;s Middle English &quot;Brut&quot;, and several anonymous Middle Welsh versions known as &quot;{{lang|cy|Brut y Brenhinedd}}&quot; (&quot;Brut of the Kings&quot;). where it was generally accepted as a true account.

In 2017, Miles Russell published the initial results of the Lost Voices of Celtic Britain Project established at Bournemouth University. The main conclusion of the study was that the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; appears to contain significant demonstrable archaeological fact, despite being compiled many centuries after the period that it describes. Geoffrey seems to have brought together a disparate mass of source material, including folklore, chronicles, king-lists, dynastic tables, oral tales, and bardic praise poems, some of which was irrevocably garbled or corrupted. In doing so, Geoffrey exercised considerable editorial control, massaging the information and smoothing out apparent inconsistencies in order to create a single grand narrative which fed into the preferred narrative of the Norman rulers of Britain. Much of the information that he used can be shown to be derived from two discrete sources:

* the orally transmitted, heroic tales of the Catuvellauni and Trinovantes, two essentially pre-Roman tribes inhabiting central south-eastern Britain at the very end of the Iron Age;
* the king-lists of important post-Roman dynasties that ruled territories in western Britain.

Stretching this source material out, chopping, changing and re-editing it in the process, Geoffrey added not just his own fictions but also additional information culled from Roman and early medieval histories and early medieval writers such as Gildas and Bede.

===Other writings===
Geoffrey&#x27;s earliest writing was probably the &quot;{{lang|la|Prophetiae Merlini}}&quot; (&quot;Prophecies of Merlin&quot;) which he wrote before 1135, and which appears both independently and incorporated into &quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot;. It consists of a series of obscure prophetic utterances attributed to Merlin which he claimed to have translated from an unspecified language.

The third work attributed to Geoffrey is the hexameter poem {{Lang|la|Vita Merlini}} (&quot;Life of Merlin&quot;), based more closely on traditional material about Merlin than the other works. Here he is known as Merlin of the Woods (&quot;Merlinus Sylvestris&quot;) or Scottish Merlin (&quot;Merlinus Caledonius&quot;) and is portrayed as an old man living as a crazed and grief-stricken outcast in the forest. The story is set long after the timeframe of the &quot;History&quot;{{&#x27;}}s Merlin, but the author tries to synchronise the works with references to the mad prophet&#x27;s previous dealings with Vortigern and Arthur. The &quot;Vita&quot; did not circulate widely, and the attribution to Geoffrey appears in only one late 13th-century manuscript, but it contains recognisably Galfridian elements in its construction and content, and most critics recognise it as his.

<text>Llandaff (; ; from &#x27;church&#x27; and &quot;Taf&quot;) is a district, community and coterminous electoral ward in the north of Cardiff, capital of Wales. It was incorporated into the city in 1922. It is the seat of the Bishop of Llandaff, whose diocese within the Church in Wales covers the most populous area of Wales.

==History==
Most of the history of Llandaff centres on its role as a religious site. Before the creation of Llandaff Cathedral, it became established as a Christian place of worship in the 6th century AD, probably because of its location as the first firm ground north of the point where the river Taff met the Bristol Channel, and because of its pre-Christian location as a river crossing on a north–south trade route. Evidence of Romano-British ritual burials have been found under the present cathedral. The date of the moving of the cathedral to Llandaff is disputed, but elements of the fabric date from the 12th century, such as the impressive Romanesque Urban Arch, named after the 12th century Bishop, Urban. It has had a history of continual destruction and restoration, as a result of warfare, neglect, and natural disaster. Llandaff has been a focal point of devastating attacks by Owain Glyndŵr and Oliver Cromwell. It was the second most damaged cathedral in the UK (after Coventry Cathedral), following Luftwaffe bombing during World War II, and subsequently restored by the architect George Pace. One of its main modern points of interest is the aluminium figure of &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot; (1954–5), by Jacob Epstein, which is suspended above the nave. In 2007, a lightning strike to its spire sent a surge through the building; which destroyed its organ. Its replacement, the largest to be built in the UK for over 40 years, was inaugurated in 2010.

The Bishop&#x27;s Palace, also known as Llandaff Castle or Bishop&#x27;s Castle now in ruins, lies to the south of the cathedral. It is believed it was constructed at a similar date to Caerphilly Castle, in the late 13th century. It is also believed it was abandoned after being attacked and damaged by Glyndŵr in the 15th century. The gatehouse of the Palace survives, and the courtyard is now a public garden.

Llandaff never developed into a chartered borough, and by the 19th century, was described as &quot;reduced to a mere village... It consists of little more than two short streets of cottages, not lighted or paved, terminating in a square, into which the great gateway of the old palace formerly opened, and where are still several genteel houses.&quot; 

Historically, Llandaff was informally known as a &#x27;city&#x27;, because of its status as the seat of the Bishop of Llandaff. This city status was never officially recognised, largely because the community did not possess a charter of incorporation. The ancient parish of Llandaff included a wide area. Apart from Llandaff itself, it included the townships of Canton, Ely, Fairwater, and Gabalfa.

During the development of the South Wales coalfield and Cardiff Docks, the parish was gradually absorbed into the Borough of Cardiff during the 19th and 20th centuries. Seen as a clean and green up-market countrified village location close to the fast developing city, many of the better-off coal merchants and business people chose to live in Llandaff, including the Insole family. The house now known as Insole Court dates originally from 1856. Llandaff itself became a civil parish, and from 1894 to 1922, was part of the Llandaff and Dinas Powis Rural District. On 9 November 1922, the county borough of Cardiff was extended to include the area.

==Demography==
At the United Kingdom Census 2011, the population of the Llandaff was 8,997; of whom 4,309 were male, and 4,688 female. 91.6% were recorded as being of various white ethnicities. Approximately 65% of the population were returned as Christian, with about 1.5% each being Hindu or Muslim, and 30% having no religion or no stated religion.

In the 2011 census, 15.3% of the population over 3 years old in Llandaff were recorded as speaking Welsh, or 1,337 people. This was a small drop compared to the 2001 census figure, which was 15.4%.

Broadcasting House in Llandaff was the headquarters of BBC Cymru Wales until it relocated to Central Square in Cardiff between October 2019 and July 2020.

Research by Owen John Thomas shows the historical strength of the Welsh language in Llandaff. According to his book (&quot;The Welsh language in Cardiff &quot;), the nonconformist church in Cardiff Road was a Welsh-language church in 1813. His work also shows that Welsh was the main language of the street in Llandaff in the 17th century.

The Llandaff Cathedral Festival was founded in 1958 and ran annually until 1986.

<text>In mathematics, and more specifically in linear algebra, a linear subspace or vector subspace is a vector space that is a subset of some larger vector space. A linear subspace is usually simply called a &quot;subspace&quot; when the context serves to distinguish it from other types of subspaces.

== Definition==
If &quot;V&quot; is a vector space over a field &quot;K&quot;, a subset &quot;W&quot; of &quot;V&quot; is a linear subspace of &quot;V&quot; if it is a vector space over &quot;K&quot; for the operations of &quot;V&quot;. Equivalently, a linear subspace of &quot;V&quot; is a nonempty subset &quot;W&quot; such that, whenever are elements of &quot;W&quot; and are elements of &quot;K&quot;, it follows that is in &quot;W&quot;.

The singleton set consisting of the zero vector alone and the entire vector space itself are linear subspaces that are called the trivial subspaces of the vector space.

== Examples ==
=== Example I ===
In the vector space &quot;V&quot; = R3 (the real coordinate space over the field R of real numbers), take &quot;W&quot; to be the set of all vectors in &quot;V&quot; whose last component is 0.
Then &quot;W&quot; is a subspace of &quot;V&quot;.

&quot;Proof:&quot;
#Given u and v in &quot;W&quot;, then they can be expressed as and . Then . Thus, u + v is an element of &quot;W&quot;, too.
#Given u in &quot;W&quot; and a scalar &quot;c&quot; in R, if again, then . Thus, &quot;c&quot;u is an element of &quot;W&quot; too.

=== Example II ===
Let the field be R again, but now let the vector space &quot;V&quot; be the Cartesian plane R2.
Take &quot;W&quot; to be the set of points (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) of R2 such that &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;.
Then &quot;W&quot; is a subspace of R2.

&quot;Proof:&quot;
#Let and be elements of &quot;W&quot;, that is, points in the plane such that &quot;p&quot;1 = &quot;p&quot;2 and &quot;q&quot;1 = &quot;q&quot;2. Then ; since &quot;p&quot;1 = &quot;p&quot;2 and &quot;q&quot;1 = &quot;q&quot;2, then &quot;p&quot;1 + &quot;q&quot;1 = &quot;p&quot;2 + &quot;q&quot;2, so p + q is an element of &quot;W&quot;.
#Let p = (&quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2) be an element of &quot;W&quot;, that is, a point in the plane such that &quot;p&quot;1 = &quot;p&quot;2, and let &quot;c&quot; be a scalar in R. Then ; since &quot;p&quot;1 = &quot;p&quot;2, then &quot;cp&quot;1 = &quot;cp&quot;2, so &quot;c&quot;p is an element of &quot;W&quot;.

In general, any subset of the real coordinate space R&quot;n&quot; that is defined by a homogeneous system of linear equations will yield a subspace.
(The equation in example I was &quot;z&quot; = 0, and the equation in example II was &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;.)

=== Example III ===
Again take the field to be R, but now let the vector space &quot;V&quot; be the set RR of all functions from R to R.
Let C(R) be the subset consisting of continuous functions.
Then C(R) is a subspace of RR.

&quot;Proof:&quot;
#We know from calculus that .
#We know from calculus that the sum of continuous functions is continuous.
#Again, we know from calculus that the product of a continuous function and a number is continuous.

=== Example IV ===
Keep the same field and vector space as before, but now consider the set Diff(R) of all differentiable functions.
The same sort of argument as before shows that this is a subspace too.

Examples that extend these themes are common in functional analysis.

== Properties of subspaces ==
From the definition of vector spaces, it follows that subspaces are nonempty, and are closed under sums and under scalar multiples. Equivalently, subspaces can be characterized by the property of being closed under linear combinations. That is, a nonempty set &quot;W&quot; is a subspace if and only if every linear combination of finitely many elements of &quot;W&quot; also belongs to &quot;W&quot;.
The equivalent definition states that it is also equivalent to consider linear combinations of two elements at a time.

In a topological vector space &quot;X&quot;, a subspace &quot;W&quot; need not be topologically closed, but a finite-dimensional subspace is always closed. The same is true for subspaces of finite codimension (i.e., subspaces determined by a finite number of continuous linear functionals).

==Descriptions==
Descriptions of subspaces include the solution set to a homogeneous system of linear equations, the subset of Euclidean space described by a system of homogeneous linear parametric equations, the span of a collection of vectors, and the null space, column space, and row space of a matrix. Geometrically (especially over the field of real numbers and its subfields), a subspace is a flat in an &quot;n&quot;-space that passes through the origin.

A natural description of a 1-subspace is the scalar multiplication of one non-zero vector v to all possible scalar values. 1-subspaces specified by two vectors are equal if and only if one vector can be obtained from another with scalar multiplication:
:formula_1
This idea is generalized for higher dimensions with linear span, but criteria for equality of &quot;k&quot;-spaces specified by sets of &quot;k&quot; vectors are not so simple.

A dual description is provided with linear functionals (usually implemented as linear equations). One non-zero linear functional F specifies its kernel subspace F = 0 of codimension 1. Subspaces of codimension 1 specified by two linear functionals are equal, if and only if one functional can be obtained from another with scalar multiplication (in the dual space):
:formula_2
It is generalized for higher codimensions with a system of equations. The following two subsections will present this latter description in details, and the remaining four subsections further describe the idea of linear span.

===Systems of linear equations===
The solution set to any homogeneous system of linear equations with &quot;n&quot; variables is a subspace in the coordinate space &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;:
formula_3

For example, the set of all vectors (over real or rational numbers) satisfying the equations
formula_4
is a one-dimensional subspace. More generally, that is to say that given a set of &quot;n&quot; independent functions, the dimension of the subspace in &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot; will be the dimension of the null set of &quot;A&quot;, the composite matrix of the &quot;n&quot; functions.

===Null space of a matrix===

In a finite-dimensional space, a homogeneous system of linear equations can be written as a single matrix equation:

:formula_5

The set of solutions to this equation is known as the null space of the matrix. For example, the subspace described above is the null space of the matrix

:formula_6

Every subspace of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; can be described as the null space of some matrix (see below for more).

===Linear parametric equations===
The subset of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; described by a system of homogeneous linear parametric equations is a subspace:

:formula_7

For example, the set of all vectors (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) parameterized by the equations

:formula_8

is a two-dimensional subspace of &quot;K&quot;3, if &quot;K&quot; is a number field (such as real or rational numbers).

===Span of vectors===

In linear algebra, the system of parametric equations can be written as a single vector equation:

:formula_9

The expression on the right is called a linear combination of the vectors
(2, 5, −1) and (3, −4, 2). These two vectors are said to span the resulting subspace.

In general, a linear combination of vectors v1, v2, ... , v&quot;k&quot; is any vector of the form

:formula_10

The set of all possible linear combinations is called the span:

:formula_11

If the vectors v1, ... , v&quot;k&quot; have &quot;n&quot; components, then their span is a subspace of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Geometrically, the span is the flat through the origin in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space determined by the points v1, ... , v&quot;k&quot;.

; Example
: The &quot;xz&quot;-plane in R3 can be parameterized by the equations
::formula_12

:As a subspace, the &quot;xz&quot;-plane is spanned by the vectors (1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 1). Every vector in the &quot;xz&quot;-plane can be written as a linear combination of these two:

::formula_13

:Geometrically, this corresponds to the fact that every point on the &quot;xz&quot;-plane can be reached from the origin by first moving some distance in the direction of (1, 0, 0) and then moving some distance in the direction of (0, 0, 1).

===Column space and row space===

A system of linear parametric equations in a finite-dimensional space can also be written as a single matrix equation:

:formula_14

In this case, the subspace consists of all possible values of the vector x. In linear algebra, this subspace is known as the column space (or image) of the matrix &quot;A&quot;. It is precisely the subspace of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; spanned by the column vectors of &quot;A&quot;.

The row space of a matrix is the subspace spanned by its row vectors. The row space is interesting because it is the orthogonal complement of the null space (see below).

===Independence, basis, and dimension===
In general, a subspace of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; determined by &quot;k&quot; parameters (or spanned by &quot;k&quot; vectors) has dimension &quot;k&quot;. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, the subspace of &quot;K&quot;3 spanned by the three vectors (1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), and (2, 0, 3) is just the &quot;xz&quot;-plane, with each point on the plane described by infinitely many different values of .

In general, vectors v1, ... , v&quot;k&quot; are called linearly independent if

:formula_15

for
(&quot;t&quot;1, &quot;t&quot;2, ... , &quot;tk&quot;) ≠ (&quot;u&quot;1, &quot;u&quot;2, ... , &quot;uk&quot;).
If are linearly independent, then the coordinates for a vector in the span are uniquely determined.

A basis for a subspace &quot;S&quot; is a set of linearly independent vectors whose span is &quot;S&quot;. The number of elements in a basis is always equal to the geometric dimension of the subspace. Any spanning set for a subspace can be changed into a basis by removing redundant vectors (see § Algorithms below for more).

; Example
: Let &quot;S&quot; be the subspace of R4 defined by the equations
::formula_16
:Then the vectors (2, 1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 5, 1) are a basis for &quot;S&quot;. In particular, every vector that satisfies the above equations can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the two basis vectors:

::formula_17

:The subspace &quot;S&quot; is two-dimensional. Geometrically, it is the plane in R4 passing through the points (0, 0, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0, 0), and (0, 0, 5, 1).

==Operations and relations on subspaces==

=== Inclusion ===

The set-theoretical inclusion binary relation specifies a partial order on the set of all subspaces (of any dimension).

A subspace cannot lie in any subspace of lesser dimension. If dim &quot;U&quot; = &quot;k&quot;, a finite number, and &quot;U&quot; ⊂ &quot;W&quot;, then dim &quot;W&quot; = &quot;k&quot; if and only if &quot;U&quot; = &quot;W&quot;.

===Intersection===

Given subspaces &quot;U&quot; and &quot;W&quot; of a vector space &quot;V&quot;, then their intersection &quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;W&quot; := {v ∈ &quot;V&quot; : v is an element of both &quot;U&quot; and &quot;W&quot;} is also a subspace of &quot;V&quot;.

&quot;Proof:&quot;
# Let v and w be elements of &quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;W&quot;. Then v and w belong to both &quot;U&quot; and &quot;W&quot;. Because &quot;U&quot; is a subspace, then v + w belongs to &quot;U&quot;. Similarly, since &quot;W&quot; is a subspace, then v + w belongs to &quot;W&quot;. Thus, v + w belongs to &quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;W&quot;.
# Let v belong to &quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;W&quot;, and let &quot;c&quot; be a scalar. Then v belongs to both &quot;U&quot; and &quot;W&quot;. Since &quot;U&quot; and &quot;W&quot; are subspaces, &quot;c&quot;v belongs to both &quot;U&quot; and &quot;W&quot;.
# Since &quot;U&quot; and &quot;W&quot; are vector spaces, then 0 belongs to both sets. Thus, 0 belongs to &quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;W&quot;.

For every vector space &quot;V&quot;, the set {0} and &quot;V&quot; itself are subspaces of &quot;V&quot;.

===Sum===
If &quot;U&quot; and &quot;W&quot; are subspaces, their sum is the subspace
formula_18

For example, the sum of two lines is the plane that contains them both. The dimension of the sum satisfies the inequality
formula_19

Here, the minimum only occurs if one subspace is contained in the other, while the maximum is the most general case. The dimension of the intersection and the sum are related by the following equation:
formula_20

A set of subspaces is independent when the only intersection between any pair of subspaces is the trivial subspace. The direct sum is the sum of independent subspaces, written as formula_21. An equivalent restatement is that a direct sum is a subspace sum under the condition that every subspace contributes to the span of the sum.

The dimension of a direct sum formula_21 is the same as the sum of subspaces, but may be shortened because the dimension of the trivial subspace is zero.

formula_23

=== Lattice of subspaces ===
The operations intersection and sum make the set of all subspaces a bounded modular lattice, where the {0} subspace, the least element, is an identity element of the sum operation, and the identical subspace &quot;V&quot;, the greatest element, is an identity element of the intersection operation.

=== Orthogonal complements ===

If formula_24 is an inner product space and formula_25 is a subset of formula_24, then the orthogonal complement of formula_25, denoted formula_28, is again a subspace. If formula_24 is finite-dimensional and formula_25 is a subspace, then the dimensions of formula_25 and formula_28 satisfy the complementary relationship formula_33. Moreover, no vector is orthogonal to itself, so formula_34 and formula_24 is the direct sum of formula_25 and formula_28. Applying orthogonal complements twice returns the original subspace: formula_38 for every subspace formula_25.

This operation, understood as negation (formula_40), makes the lattice of subspaces a (possibly infinite) orthocomplemented lattice (although not a distributive lattice).

In spaces with other bilinear forms, some but not all of these results still hold. In pseudo-Euclidean spaces and symplectic vector spaces, for example, orthogonal complements exist. However, these spaces may have null vectors that are orthogonal to themselves, and consequently there exist subspaces formula_25 such that formula_42. As a result, this operation does not turn the lattice of subspaces into a Boolean algebra (nor a Heyting algebra).

==Algorithms==
Most algorithms for dealing with subspaces involve row reduction. This is the process of applying elementary row operations to a matrix, until it reaches either row echelon form or reduced row echelon form. Row reduction has the following important properties:
# The reduced matrix has the same null space as the original.
# Row reduction does not change the span of the row vectors, i.e. the reduced matrix has the same row space as the original.
# Row reduction does not affect the linear dependence of the column vectors.

===Basis for a row space===
:Input An &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot;.
:Output A basis for the row space of &quot;A&quot;.
:# Use elementary row operations to put &quot;A&quot; into row echelon form.
:# The nonzero rows of the echelon form are a basis for the row space of &quot;A&quot;.
See the article on row space for an example.

If we instead put the matrix &quot;A&quot; into reduced row echelon form, then the resulting basis for the row space is uniquely determined. This provides an algorithm for checking whether two row spaces are equal and, by extension, whether two subspaces of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; are equal.

===Subspace membership===
:Input A basis {b1, b2, ..., b&quot;k&quot;} for a subspace &quot;S&quot; of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and a vector v with &quot;n&quot; components.
:Output Determines whether v is an element of &quot;S&quot;
:# Create a (&quot;k&quot; + 1) × &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; whose rows are the vectors b1, ... , b&quot;k&quot; and v.
:# Use elementary row operations to put &quot;A&quot; into row echelon form.
:# If the echelon form has a row of zeroes, then the vectors are linearly dependent, and therefore .

===Basis for a column space===
:Input An &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot;
:Output A basis for the column space of &quot;A&quot;
:# Use elementary row operations to put &quot;A&quot; into row echelon form.
:# Determine which columns of the echelon form have pivots. The corresponding columns of the original matrix are a basis for the column space.
See the article on column space for an example.

This produces a basis for the column space that is a subset of the original column vectors. It works because the columns with pivots are a basis for the column space of the echelon form, and row reduction does not change the linear dependence relationships between the columns.

===Coordinates for a vector===
:Input A basis {b1, b2, ..., b&quot;k&quot;} for a subspace &quot;S&quot; of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and a vector 
:Output Numbers &quot;t&quot;1, &quot;t&quot;2, ..., &quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot; such that 
:# Create an augmented matrix &quot;A&quot; whose columns are b1...,b&quot;k&quot; , with the last column being v.
:# Use elementary row operations to put &quot;A&quot; into reduced row echelon form.
:# Express the final column of the reduced echelon form as a linear combination of the first &quot;k&quot; columns. The coefficients used are the desired numbers . (These should be precisely the first &quot;k&quot; entries in the final column of the reduced echelon form.)
If the final column of the reduced row echelon form contains a pivot, then the input vector v does not lie in &quot;S&quot;.

===Basis for a null space===
:Input An &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot;.
:Output A basis for the null space of &quot;A&quot;
:# Use elementary row operations to put &quot;A&quot; in reduced row echelon form.
:# Using the reduced row echelon form, determine which of the variables are free. Write equations for the dependent variables in terms of the free variables.
:# For each free variable &quot;xi&quot;, choose a vector in the null space for which and the remaining free variables are zero. The resulting collection of vectors is a basis for the null space of &quot;A&quot;.
See the article on null space for an example.

===Basis for the sum and intersection of two subspaces===
Given two subspaces and of , a basis of the sum formula_43 and the intersection formula_44 can be calculated using the Zassenhaus algorithm.

===Equations for a subspace===
:Input A basis {b1, b2, ..., b&quot;k&quot;} for a subspace &quot;S&quot; of &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;
:Output An (&quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot;) × &quot;n&quot; matrix whose null space is &quot;S&quot;.
:# Create a matrix &quot;A&quot; whose rows are .
:# Use elementary row operations to put &quot;A&quot; into reduced row echelon form.
:# Let be the columns of the reduced row echelon form. For each column without a pivot, write an equation expressing the column as a linear combination of the columns with pivots.
:# This results in a homogeneous system of &quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot; linear equations involving the variables c1...,c&quot;n&quot;. The matrix corresponding to this system is the desired matrix with nullspace &quot;S&quot;.
; Example
:If the reduced row echelon form of &quot;A&quot; is

::formula_45

:then the column vectors satisfy the equations

::formula_46

:It follows that the row vectors of &quot;A&quot; satisfy the equations

::formula_47

:In particular, the row vectors of &quot;A&quot; are a basis for the null space of the corresponding matrix.

<doc id="56358" wikidata="Q161807" url="?curid=56358" title="Mangifera">
<text>Mangifera is a genus of flowering plants in the cashew family, Anacardiaceae. It contains 64 species, with the best-known being the common mango (&quot;Mangifera indica&quot;). The center of diversity of the genus is in the Malesian ecoregion of Southeast Asia, particularly in Sumatra, Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula. They are generally canopy trees in lowland rainforests, reaching a height of .

==Uses==
&quot;Mangifera&quot; species are widely cultivated in Asia and elsewhere. More than 27 species in the genus bear edible, fleshy fruits, especially the common mango (&quot;M. indica&quot;). Others, such as &quot;M. foetida&quot;, yield astringent fruits that can be eaten pickled.

Mango wastes, such as the seed kernel and peel, have high functional and nutritional potential. Mango seed contains important bioactive compounds that have high antioxidant activity, lipids that have acceptable physical and chemical characteristics (free of &quot;trans&quot; fatty acids), and a somewhat high (about 6%) protein content. The mango peel contains considerable amounts of antioxidants and dietary fiber.

==Fossil record==
The earliest fossil species thought to be related to &quot;Mangifera&quot; is &quot;Eomangiferophyllum damalgiriense&quot; from the upper Paleocene in northeastern India. Leaves have also been reported from the Paleocene of Japan and the Eocene of Germany, though these have been considered questionable. Leaf fossils confidently assignable to &quot;Mangifera&quot; have been collected from Oligocene or early Miocene sediments in northern Thailand.

<text>Leo Szilard (; ; born Leó Spitz; February 11, 1898 – May 30, 1964) was a Hungarian-born physicist, biologist and inventor who made numerous important discoveries in nuclear physics and the biological sciences. He conceived the nuclear chain reaction in 1933, and patented the idea in 1936. In late 1939 he wrote the letter for Albert Einstein&#x27;s signature that resulted in the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb, and then in 1944 wrote the Szilard petition asking President Truman to demonstrate the bomb without dropping it on civilians. According to György Marx, he was one of the Hungarian scientists known as The Martians.

Szilard initially attended Palatine Joseph Technical University in Budapest, but his engineering studies were interrupted by service in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He left Hungary for Germany in 1919, enrolling at Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in Berlin-Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin), but became bored with engineering and transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm University, where he studied physics. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Maxwell&#x27;s demon, a long-standing puzzle in the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics. Szilard was the first scientist of note to recognize the connection between thermodynamics and information theory.

Szilard coined and submitted the earliest known patent applications and the first publications for the concept of the electron microscope (1928), the cyclotron (1929), and also contributed to the development of the linear accelerator (1928) in Germany. Between 1926 and 1930, he worked with Einstein on the development of the Einstein refrigerator.

After Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, where he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs. While in England, Szilard, alongside Thomas A. Chalmers, discovered a means of isotope separation known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect.

Foreseeing another war in Europe, Szilard moved to the United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of creating a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved within the Chicago Pile-1 on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago on aspects of nuclear reactor design, where he was the chief physicist. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating a non-lethal demonstration of the atomic bomb, but the Interim Committee chose to use them in a military strike instead.

Together with Enrico Fermi, he applied for a nuclear reactor patent in 1944. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind.

His inventions, discoveries, and contributions related to biological science are also equally important; they include the discovery of feedback inhibition and the invention of the chemostat. According to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus, Szilard gave essential advice which made the earliest cloning of the human cell a reality.

Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver &quot;the sweet voice of reason&quot; about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his sleep of a heart attack in 1964.

==Early life==
He was born as Leó Spitz in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, on February 11, 1898. His middle-class Jewish parents, Lajos (Louis) Spitz, a civil engineer, and Tekla Vidor, raised Leó on the Városligeti Fasor in Pest. He had two younger siblings, a brother, Béla, born in 1900, and a sister, Rózsi, born in 1901. On October 4, 1900, the family changed its surname from the German &quot;Spitz&quot; to the Hungarian &quot;Szilárd&quot;, a name that means &quot;solid&quot; in Hungarian. Despite having a religious background, Szilard became an agnostic. From 1908 to 1916 he attended Föreáliskola (high school) in Budapest&#x27;s 6th District . Showing an early interest in physics and a proficiency in mathematics, in 1916 he won the Eötvös Prize, a national prize for mathematics.

With World War I raging in Europe, Szilard received notice on January 22, 1916, that he had been drafted into the 5th Fortress Regiment, but he was able to continue his studies. He enrolled as an engineering student at the Palatine Joseph Technical University, which he entered in September 1916. The following year he joined the Austro-Hungarian Army&#x27;s 4th Mountain Artillery Regiment, but immediately was sent to Budapest as an officer candidate. He rejoined his regiment in May 1918 but in September, before being sent to the front, he fell ill with Spanish Influenza and was returned home for hospitalization. Later he was informed that his regiment had been nearly annihilated in battle, so the illness probably saved his life. He was discharged honorably in November 1918, after the Armistice.

In January 1919, Szilard resumed his engineering studies, but Hungary was in a chaotic political situation with the rise of the Hungarian Soviet Republic under Béla Kun. Szilard and his brother Béla founded their own political group, the Hungarian Association of Socialist Students, with a platform based on a scheme of Szilard&#x27;s for taxation reform. He was convinced that socialism was the answer to Hungary&#x27;s post-war problems, but not that of Kun&#x27;s Hungarian Socialist Party, which had close ties to the Soviet Union. When Kun&#x27;s government tottered, the brothers officially changed their religion from &quot;Israelite&quot; to &quot;Calvinist&quot;, but when they attempted to re-enroll in what was now the Budapest University of Technology, they were prevented from doing so by nationalist students because they were Jews.

=== Time in Berlin ===
Convinced that there was no future for him in Hungary, Szilard left for Berlin via Austria on December 25, 1919, and enrolled at the Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He was soon joined by his brother Béla. Szilard became bored with engineering, and his attention turned to physics. This was not taught at the Technische Hochschule, so he transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm University, where he attended lectures given by Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Walter Nernst, James Franck and Max von Laue. He also met fellow Hungarian students Eugene Wigner, John von Neumann and Dennis Gabor.

Szilard&#x27;s doctoral dissertation on thermodynamics &quot;Über die thermodynamischen Schwankungserscheinungen&quot; (On The Manifestation of Thermodynamic Fluctuations), praised by Einstein, won top honors in 1922. It involved a long-standing puzzle in the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics known as Maxwell&#x27;s demon, a thought experiment originated by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell. The problem was thought to be insoluble, but in tackling it Szilard recognized the connection between thermodynamics and information theory.
Szilard was appointed as assistant to von Laue at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1924. In 1927 he finished his habilitation and became a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (private lecturer) in physics. For his habilitation lecture, he produced a second paper on Maxwell&#x27;s demon, &quot;Über die Entropieverminderung in einem thermodynamischen System bei Eingriffen intelligenter Wesen&quot; (On the reduction of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings), that had actually been written soon after the first. This introduced the thought experiment now called the Szilard engine and became important in the history of attempts to understand Maxwell&#x27;s demon. The paper also introduced the first equation linking negative entropy and information. This work established Szilard as a foundational figure in information theory; however, he did not publish it until 1929 and chose not to pursue the topic further. Cybernetics, via the work of Norbert Wiener and Claude E. Shannon, would later develop the concept into a general theory in the 1940s and 1950s—though, during the time of the Cybernetics Meetings, John Von Neumann pointed out that Szilard first equated information with entropy in his review of Wiener&#x27;s .

Throughout his time in Berlin, Szilard worked on numerous technical inventions. In 1928 he submitted a patent application for the linear accelerator, not knowing of Gustav Ising&#x27;s prior 1924 journal article and Rolf Widerøe&#x27;s operational device, and in 1929 applied for one for the cyclotron. He was also the first person to conceive the idea of the electron microscope, and submitted the earliest patent for one in 1928. Between 1926 and 1930, he worked with Einstein to develop the Einstein refrigerator, notable because it had no moving parts. He did not build all of these devices, or publish these ideas in scientific journals, and so credit for them often went to others. As a result, Szilard never received the Nobel Prize, but Ernest Lawrence was awarded it for the cyclotron in 1939, and Ernst Ruska for the electron microscope in 1986.
Szilard received German citizenship in 1930, but was already uneasy about the political situation in Europe. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, and transferred his savings of £1,595 (£ today) from his bank in Zürich to one in London. He lived in hotels where lodging and meals cost about £5.5 a week. For those less fortunate, he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs, and persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He enlisted the help of academics such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it had helped to find places for over 2,500 refugee scholars.

=== Nuclear physics ===
On the morning of September 12, 1933, Szilard read an article in &quot;The Times&quot; summarizing a speech given by Lord Rutherford in which Rutherford rejected the feasibility of using atomic energy for practical purposes. The speech remarked specifically on the recent 1932 work of his students, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, in &quot;splitting&quot; lithium into alpha particles, by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. Rutherford went on to say:

Szilard was so annoyed at Rutherford&#x27;s dismissal that, on the same day, he conceived of the idea of nuclear chain reaction (analogous to a chemical chain reaction), using recently discovered neutrons. The idea did not use the mechanism of nuclear fission, which was not yet discovered, but Szilard realized that if neutrons could initiate any sort of energy-producing nuclear reaction, such as the one that had occurred in lithium, and could be produced themselves by the same reaction, energy might be obtained with little input, since the reaction would be self-sustaining. He wanted to carry out a systematic survey of all 92 then-known elements in order to find one that can allow the chain reaction, at an estimated cost of $8000, but he did not for lack of funds.

Szilard filed for a patent on the concept of the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction in June 1934, which was granted in March 1936. Under section 30 of the &quot;Patents and Designs Act&quot; (1907, UK), Szilard was able to assign the patent to the British Admiralty to ensure its secrecy, which he did. Consequently, his patent was not published until 1949 when the relevant parts of the &quot;Patents and Designs Act&quot; (1907, UK) were repealed by the &quot;Patents and Designs Act&quot; (July 1949, UK). Richard Rhodes described Szilard&#x27;s moment of inspiration:

Prior to conceiving the nuclear chain reaction, in 1932 Szilard had read H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The World Set Free&quot;, a book describing continuing explosives which Wells termed &quot;atomic bombs&quot;; Szilard wrote in his memoirs the book had made &quot;a very great impression on me.&quot; When Szilard assigned his patent to the Admiralty to keep the news from reaching the notice of the wider scientific community, he wrote, &quot;Knowing what this [a chain reaction] would mean—and I knew it because I had read H. G. Wells—I did not want this patent to become public.&quot;

In early 1934, Szilard began working at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. Working with a young physicist on the hospital staff, Thomas A. Chalmers, he began studying radioactive isotopes for medical purposes. It was known that bombarding elements with neutrons could produce either heavier isotopes of an element, or a heavier element, a phenomenon known as the Fermi Effect after its discoverer, the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. When they bombarded ethyl iodide with neutrons produced by a radon–beryllium source, they found that the heavier radioactive isotopes of iodine separated from the compound. Thus, they had discovered a means of isotope separation. This method became known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect, and was widely used in the preparation of medical isotopes. He also attempted unsuccessfully to create a nuclear chain reaction using beryllium by bombarding it with X-rays.

==Manhattan Project==

===Columbia University===
Szilard visited Béla and Rose and her husband Roland (Lorand) Detre, in Switzerland in September 1937. After a rainstorm, he and his siblings spent an afternoon in an unsuccessful attempt to build a prototype collapsible umbrella. One reason for the visit was that he had decided to emigrate to the United States, as he believed that another war in Europe was inevitable and imminent. He reached New York on the liner on January 2, 1938. Over the next few months, he moved from place to place, conducting research with Maurice Goldhaber at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, and then the University of Chicago, University of Michigan and the University of Rochester, where he undertook experiments with indium but again failed to initiate a chain reaction.
In early 1938, Szilard would settle down at &quot;what would become a haven for much of the rest of his life&quot; when he took a room at the King&#x27;s Crown Hotel in New York City, being near Columbia University where he now conducted research without a formal title or position. He encountered John R. Dunning, who invited him to speak about his research at an afternoon seminar in January 1939. That same month, Niels Bohr brought news with him to New York that nuclear fission had accidentally been observed by chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin on December 19, 1938. Hahn and Strassman&#x27;s misunderstanding of their observation would be corrected theoretically and thus explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, as Meitner had known of Szilard&#x27;s theory back in 1933 and after re-conducting the experiment themselves, confirmed Szilard&#x27;s theory to have been correct all along. When Szilard found out about it on a visit to Wigner at Princeton University, he immediately realized that uranium might be the element capable of sustaining a chain reaction.

Unable to convince Fermi that this was the case, Szilard set out on his own. He obtained permission from the head of the physics department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months. To fund his experiment, he borrowed $2,000 from a fellow inventor, Benjamin Liebowitz. He wired Frederick Lindemann at Oxford and asked him to send a beryllium cylinder. He persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator and hired Semyon Krewer to investigate processes for manufacturing pure uranium and graphite.

Szilard and Zinn conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium–beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. Initially nothing registered on the oscilloscope, but then Zinn realized that it was not plugged in. On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: &quot;We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home.&quot; He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. &quot;That night, there was very little doubt in my mind that the world was headed for grief&quot;.

While they had demonstrated that the fission of uranium produced more neutrons than it consumed, this was still not a chain reaction. Szilard persuaded Fermi and Herbert L. Anderson to try a larger experiment using of uranium. To maximize the chance of fission, they needed a neutron moderator to slow the neutrons down. Hydrogen was a known moderator, so they used water. The results were disappointing. It became apparent that hydrogen slowed neutrons down, but also absorbed them, leaving fewer for the chain reaction. Szilard then suggested Fermi use carbon, in the form of graphite. He felt he would need about (50.8 metric ton) of graphite and of uranium. As a back-up plan, Szilard also considered where he might find a few tons of heavy water; deuterium would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen but would have the similar value as a moderator. Such quantities of material would require a lot of money.

Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, warning of the German nuclear weapon project, and encouraging the development of a program that could result in their creation. With the help of Wigner and Edward Teller, he approached his old friend and collaborator Einstein in August 1939, and persuaded him to sign the letter, lending his fame to the proposal. The Einstein–Szilárd letter resulted in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the US government, and ultimately to the creation of the Manhattan Project. Roosevelt gave the letter to his aide, Brigadier General Edwin M. &quot;Pa&quot; Watson with the instruction: &quot;Pa, this requires action!&quot;

An Advisory Committee on Uranium was formed under Lyman J. Briggs, a scientist and the director of the National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on October 21, 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller, and Wigner, who persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite. A 1940 Army intelligence report on Fermi and Szilard, prepared when the United States had not yet entered World War II, expressed reservations about both. While it contained some errors of fact about Szilard, it correctly noted his dire prediction that Germany would win the war.

Fermi and Szilard met with Herbert G. MacPherson and V. C. Hamister of the National Carbon Company, who manufactured graphite, and Szilard made another important discovery. He asked about impurities in graphite and learned from MacPherson that it usually contained boron, a neutron absorber. He then had special boron-free graphite produced. Had he not done so, they might have concluded, as the German nuclear researchers did, that graphite was unsuitable for use as a neutron moderator. Like the German researchers, Fermi and Szilard still believed that enormous quantities of uranium would be required for an atomic bomb, and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction. Fermi determined that a fissioning uranium atom produced 1.73 neutrons on average. It was enough, but a careful design was called for to minimize losses. Szilard worked up various designs for a nuclear reactor. &quot;If the uranium project could have been run on ideas alone,&quot; Wigner later remarked, &quot;no one but Leo Szilard would have been needed.&quot;

===Metallurgical Laboratory===

At its December 6, 1941, meeting, the National Defense Research Committee resolved to proceed with an all-out effort to produce atomic bombs. This decision was given urgency by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the following day that brought the United States into World War II. It was formally approved by Roosevelt in January 1942. Arthur H. Compton from the University of Chicago was appointed head of research and development. Against Szilard&#x27;s wishes, Compton concentrated all the groups working on reactors and plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. Compton laid out an ambitious plan to achieve a chain reaction by January 1943, start manufacturing plutonium in nuclear reactors by January 1944, and produce an atomic bomb by January 1945.

In January 1942, Szilard joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago as a research associate, and later the chief physicist. Alvin Weinberg noted that Szilard served as the project &quot;gadfly&quot;, asking all the embarrassing questions. Szilard provided important insights. While uranium-238 did not fission readily with slow, moderated neutrons, it might still fission with the fast neutrons produced by fission. This effect was small but crucial. Szilard made suggestions that improved the uranium canning process, and worked with David Gurinsky and Ed Creutz on a method for recovering uranium from its salts.

A vexing question at the time was how a production reactor should be cooled. Taking a conservative view that every possible neutron must be preserved, the majority opinion initially favored cooling with helium, which would absorb very few neutrons. Szilard argued that if this was a concern, then liquid bismuth would be a better choice. He supervised experiments with it, but the practical difficulties turned out to be too great. In the end, Wigner&#x27;s plan to use ordinary water as a coolant won out. When the coolant issue became too heated, Compton and the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., moved to dismiss Szilard, who was still a German citizen, but the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, refused to do so. Szilard was therefore present on December 2, 1942, when the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved in the first nuclear reactor under viewing stands of Stagg Field and shook Fermi&#x27;s hand.

Szilard started to acquire high-quality graphite and uranium, which were the necessary materials for building a large-scale chain reaction experiment. The success of this demonstration and technological breakthrough at the University of Chicago were partially due to Szilard&#x27;s new atomic theories, his uranium lattice design, and the identification and mitigation of a key graphite impurity (boron) through a joint collaboration with graphite suppliers.

Szilard became a naturalized citizen of the United States in March 1943. The Army offered Szilard $25,000 for his inventions before November 1940, when he officially joined the project. He refused. He was the co-holder, with Fermi, of the patent on the nuclear reactor. In the end he sold his patent to the government for reimbursement of his expenses, some $15,416, plus the standard $1 fee. He continued to work with Fermi and Wigner on nuclear reactor design and is credited with coining the term &quot;breeder reactor&quot;.

With an enduring passion for the preservation of human life and political freedom, Szilard hoped that the US government would not use nuclear weapons, but that the mere threat of such weapons would force Germany and Japan to surrender. He also worried about the long-term implications of nuclear weapons, predicting that their use by the United States would start a nuclear arms race with the USSR. He drafted the Szilárd petition advocating that the atomic bomb be demonstrated to the enemy, and used only if the enemy did not then surrender. The Interim Committee instead chose to use atomic bombs against cities over the protests of Szilard and other scientists. Afterwards, he lobbied for amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 that placed nuclear energy under civilian control.

==After the war==

In 1946, Szilard secured a research professorship at the University of Chicago that allowed him to research in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in the quest for a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a bioreactor, and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955.

===Personal life===
Before his relationship with his later wife Gertrud &quot;Trude&quot; Weiss, Leo Szilard&#x27;s life partner in the period 1927–1934 was the kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue this work. Szilard married Trude Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They had known each other since 1929 and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver for weeks at a time when they had never been together for more than a few days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time and, after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked, having considered Szilard a born bachelor.

===Writings===
In 1949 Szilard wrote a short story titled &quot;My Trial as a War Criminal&quot; in which he imagined himself on trial for crimes against humanity after the United States lost a war with the Soviet Union. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, explaining in a University of Chicago Round Table radio program on February 26, 1950, that a sufficiently big thermonuclear bomb rigged with specific but common materials, might annihilate mankind. His comments, as well as those of Hans Bethe, Harrison Brown, and Frederick Seitz (the three other scientists who participated in the program), were attacked by the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s former Chairman David Lilienthal, and the criticisms plus a response from Szilard were published. &quot;Time&quot; compared Szilard to Chicken Little while the AEC dismissed his ideas, but scientists debated whether it was feasible or not; the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; commissioned a study by James R. Arnold, who concluded that it was. Physicist W. H. Clark suggested that a 50 megaton cobalt bomb did have the potential to produce sufficient long-lasting radiation to be a doomsday weapon, in theory, but was of the view that, even then, &quot;enough people might find refuge to wait out the radioactivity and emerge to begin again.&quot;

In 1961 he proposed the idea of &quot;Mined Cities&quot;, an early example of mutually assured destruction.

Szilard published a book of short stories, &quot;The Voice of the Dolphins&quot; (1961), in which he dealt with the moral and ethical issues raised by the Cold War and his own role in the development of atomic weapons. The title story described an international biology research laboratory in Central Europe. This became reality after a meeting in 1962 with Victor F. Weisskopf, James Watson and John Kendrew. When the European Molecular Biology Laboratory was established, the library was named The Szilard Library and the library stamp features dolphins. Other honors that he received included the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, and the Humanist of the Year in 1960. A lunar crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him in 1970. The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award, established in 1974, is given in his honor by the American Physical Society.

===Cancer diagnosis and treatment===
In 1960, Szilard was diagnosed with bladder cancer. He underwent cobalt therapy at New York&#x27;s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital using a cobalt 60 treatment regimen that his doctors gave him a high degree of control over. A second round of treatment with an increased dose followed in 1962. The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned.

===Last years===

Szilard spent his last years as a fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in the La Jolla community of San Diego, California, which he had helped create. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver &quot;the sweet voice of reason&quot; about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He was appointed a non-resident fellow there in July 1963, and became a resident fellow on April 1, 1964, after moving to San Diego in February. With Trude, he lived in a bungalow on the property of the Hotel del Charro. On May 30, 1964, he died there in his sleep of a heart attack; when Trude awoke, she was unable to revive him. His remains were cremated.

His papers are in the library at the University of California, San Diego. In February 2014, the library announced that it received funding from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission to digitize its collection of his papers, ranging from 1938 to 1998.

<doc id="56360" wikidata="Q245280" url="?curid=56360" title="Sorbitol">
<text>Sorbitol (), less commonly known as glucitol (), is a sugar alcohol with a sweet taste which the human body metabolizes slowly. It can be obtained by reduction of glucose, which changes the converted aldehyde group (−CHO) to a primary alcohol group (−CH2OH). Most sorbitol is made from potato starch, but it is also found in nature, for example in apples, pears, peaches, and prunes. It is converted to fructose by sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase. Sorbitol is an isomer of mannitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon2. While similar, the two sugar alcohols have very different sources in nature, melting points, and uses.

As an over-the-counter drug, sorbitol is used as a laxative to treat constipation.

==Synthesis==

Sorbitol may be synthesised via a glucose reduction reaction in which the converted aldehyde group is converted into a hydroxyl group. The reaction requires NADH and is catalyzed by aldose reductase. Glucose reduction is the first step of the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism, and is implicated in multiple diabetic complications. 

The mechanism involves a tyrosine residue in the active site of aldehyde reductase. The hydrogen atom on NADH is transferred to the electrophilic aldehyde carbon atom; electrons on the aldehyde carbon-oxygen double bond are transferred to the oxygen that abstracts the proton on tyrosine side chain to form the hydroxyl group. The role of aldehyde reductase tyrosine phenol group is to serve as a general acid to provide proton to the reduced aldehyde oxygen on glucose.

Glucose reduction is not the major glucose metabolism pathway in a normal human body, where the glucose level is in the normal range. However, in diabetic patients whose blood glucose level is high, up to 1/3 of their glucose could go through the glucose reduction pathway. This will consume NADH and eventually leads to cell damage.

==Uses==

===Sweetener===
Sorbitol is a sugar substitute, and when used in food it has the INS number and E number 420. Sorbitol is about 60% as sweet as sucrose (table sugar).

Sorbitol is referred to as a nutritive sweetener because it provides some dietary energy. It is partly absorbed from the small intestine and metabolized in the body, and partly fermented in the large intestine. The fermentation produces short-chain fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, which are mostly absorbed and provide energy, but also carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen which do not provide energy. Even though the heat of combustion of sorbitol is higher than that of glucose (having two extra hydrogen atoms), the net energy contribution is between 2.5 and 3.4 kilocalories per gram, versus the approximately 4 kilocalories (17 kilojoules) for carbohydrates. It is often used in diet foods (including diet drinks and ice cream), mints, cough syrups, and sugar-free chewing gum. Most bacteria cannot use sorbitol for energy, but it can be slowly fermented in the mouth by &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;, a bacterium that causes tooth decay. In contrast, many other sugar alcohols such as isomalt and xylitol are considered non-acidogenic.

It also occurs naturally in many stone fruits and berries from trees of the genus &quot;Sorbus&quot;.

===Medical applications===

====Laxative====
As is the case with other sugar alcohols, foods containing sorbitol can cause gastrointestinal distress. Sorbitol can be used as a laxative when taken orally or as an enema. Sorbitol works as a laxative by drawing water into the large intestine, stimulating bowel movements. Sorbitol has been determined safe for use by the elderly, although it is not recommended without the advice of a physician. 

Sorbitol is commonly used orally as a one-time dose of 70% solution. It may also be used as a one-time rectal enema.

====Other medical applications====
Sorbitol is used in bacterial culture media to distinguish the pathogenic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; O157:H7 from most other strains of &quot;E. coli&quot;, because it is usually unable to ferment sorbitol, unlike 93% of known &quot;E. coli&quot; strains.

A treatment for hyperkalaemia (elevated blood potassium) uses sorbitol and the ion-exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (tradename Kayexalate). The resin exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the bowel, while sorbitol helps to eliminate it. In 2010, the U.S. FDA issued a warning of increased risk for gastrointestinal necrosis with this combination.

Sorbitol is also used in the manufacture of softgel capsules to store single doses of liquid medicines.

===Health care, food, and cosmetic uses===
Sorbitol often is used in modern cosmetics as a humectant and thickener. It is also used in mouthwash and toothpaste. Some transparent gels can be made only with sorbitol, because of its high refractive index.

Sorbitol is used as a cryoprotectant additive (mixed with sucrose and sodium polyphosphates) in the manufacture of surimi, a processed fish paste. It is also used as a humectant in some cigarettes.

Beyond its use as a sugar substitute in reduced-sugar foods, sorbitol is also used as a humectant in cookies and low-moisture foods like peanut butter and fruit preserves. In baking, it is also valuable because it acts as a plasticizer, and slows down the staling process.

===Miscellaneous uses===
A mixture of sorbitol and potassium nitrate has found some success as an amateur solid rocket fuel. It has similar performance to sucrose-based rocket candy, but is easier to cast, less hygroscopic and does not caramelize.

Sorbitol is identified as a potential key chemical intermediate for production of fuels from biomass resources. Carbohydrate fractions in biomass such as cellulose undergo sequential hydrolysis and hydrogenation in the presence of metal catalysts to produce sorbitol. Complete reduction of sorbitol opens the way to alkanes, such as hexane, which can be used as a biofuel. Hydrogen required for this reaction can be produced by aqueous phase catalytic reforming of sorbitol.

:19 C6H14O6 → 13 C6H14 + 36 CO2 + 42 H2O

The above chemical reaction is exothermic, and 1.5 moles of sorbitol generate approximately 1 mole of hexane. When hydrogen is co-fed, no carbon dioxide is produced.

Sorbitol based polyols are used in the production of polyurethane foam for the construction industry.

It is also added after electroporation of yeasts in transformation protocols, allowing the cells to recover by raising the osmolarity of the medium.

==Medical importance==
Aldose reductase is the first enzyme in the sorbitol-aldose reductase pathway responsible for the reduction of glucose to sorbitol, as well as the reduction of galactose to galactitol. Too much sorbitol trapped in retinal cells, the cells of the lens, and the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves, is a frequent result of long-term hyperglycemia that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes. This can damage these cells, leading to retinopathy, cataracts and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. 

Sorbitol is fermented in the colon and produces short-chain fatty acids, which are beneficial to overall colon health.

==Potential adverse effects==
Sorbitol may cause allergic reactions in some people. Common side effects from use as a laxative are stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhea or rectal bleeding.

<text>Free flying is a skydiving discipline that began in the late 1980s, involving falling free in various vertical orientations, as opposed to the traditional &quot;belly-to-earth&quot; orientation. The discipline is known to have originated when Olav Zipser began experimenting with non-traditional forms of Body flight. Zipser founded the Free Fly Clowns as a two-person competitive team with Mike Vail in 1992. He was joined by Omar Alhegelan (1st ever FAI Freestyle World Cup &amp; World Champion), Charles Bryan, and Stefania Martinengo in 1994. The Free Fly Clowns are also credited with opening the first school to teach free flying, The First School of Modern Skydiving.

Free flying entered public awareness in 1996 when the SSI Pro Tour added free flying as a three-person competitive discipline at the second televised event (with Skysurfing), part of ESPN&#x27;s Destination Extreme series. One-hundred and fifty countries watched the Free Fly Clowns (Olav Zipser, Charles Bryan and Omar Alhegelan) as they took 1st place in all four international competitions along with other teams including: the Fly boys (Eli Thompson, Mike Ortiz, Knut Krecker, Fritz Pfnür), Team AirTime (Tony Urugallo, Jim O&#x27;Reilly, Peter Raymond, Brian Germain), and many other pioneers of free flying.

From 1996 to 1997, the SSI Pro Tour staged eight televised events in both North America and Europe, with $36,000 in cash prizes awarded to free-fly teams. SSI invited the 1997 Pro World Champions, the Flyboyz, to participate in the 1998 ESPN X Games as an unofficial exhibition.
The resulting global television exposure attracted considerable attention to the FreeFly Clowns, the Flyboyz, and Freeflying as a discipline. A once fledgling offshoot of the mainstream, freeflying now comprises one-half of the overall skydiving community.

Zipser&#x27;s Space Games used a &quot;space ball&quot; as a research and measuring device to provide a constant speed and direction from which individual athletes could be trained, judged, and allow individuals to race each other. In 1998, the Space Games accelerated in popularity and brought publicity to the sport Free Flying.

In 2000, Free Fly was accepted as an aviation discipline by the International Parachute Commission (IPC) and the first official Free Fly National Championships were held worldwide.

==Technique==
Free flying is a form of skydiving that involves a range of body orientations, including both traditional belly-to-earth positions and vertical flight, where the skydiver is either upright (feet-first) or inverted (head-first). These positions allow for unique formations and faster freefall.

To master free flying, skydivers must learn various body positions such as the box position (belly-to-earth), back flying, head-up, head-down, and side flying. Skydivers often transition between these positions during a dive, with varying speeds and orientations, either flowing continuously or holding specific positions to form larger formations.

Free flying carries additional risks due to the increased speed. Skydivers must be cautious to avoid collisions with belly-to-earth divers and must slow their descent before deploying their parachute, as most parachutes are not designed for high-speed openings.

Though a newer and more extreme discipline, freeflying is growing in popularity in competitions and record-setting events.

===Back flying===
Back flying is the ability to fly on the back in a stable and controlled fashion. This skill is critical, so that when the flyer flips out of some of the more advanced positions, he or she stays in control and does not endanger themselves or other skydivers.

===Sit flying===

Sit flying is called such because it looks similar to the position taken while sitting in a chair.

For flying a sit, the feet are oriented toward the relative wind and 90-degree bends are maintained at the knees, hips, and shoulders. To move around, the flyer redirects the airflow in the opposite direction the jumper wants to go. Newtonian mechanics then push the flyer in the desired direction. Fall rate changes (descending faster or slower) can also be made.

=== Head down ===
A person falling in the &quot;head down&quot; position has less cross-sectional area exposed to the air while falling, which results in much faster fall rates. Average speeds while flying head down are around . Due to the increased speed, every movement made can cause the skydiver to become unstable or disoriented; thus increasing the risk involved in free flying.

==Vertical Formation Skydiving==

Vertical formation skydiving (VFS) is a subcategory of formation skydiving using high-speed body positions normally associated with free flying. Competitors build pre-selected formations in free-fall with multiple people gripping each other&#x27;s limbs or specially built &quot;grippers&quot; on their jumpsuits.

The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) world record for the largest VFS free-fall formation is a 164-way, set on July 31, 2015 over Chicago, Illinois, United States. 

Project Horizon, the Lodi Sequentials, VFS Arizona, and several other yearly invitational skydiving events are centered on pushing the boundaries of VFS.

=== Competition ===

There is only one category of official VFS competition, that being VFS 4-way, which is part of the United States Parachute Association Skydiving Nationals. The first official VFS 4-Way US Nationals Competition was held on October 27, 2006, in Eloy, Arizona. Nine teams (45 skydivers) competed.

VFS 4-way has been adopted as an addition to future FAI world competitions (as VFS 4-way), the first being the FAI World Cup in Eloy, AZ, in October 2008.

== Records ==
The world&#x27;s largest vertical (head down) formation took place on Friday, 31 July 2015, when a multinational team of 164 skydivers, some traveling at speeds of over 200 mph, linked over Skydive Chicago, in Ottawa, Illinois, United States. This broke the previous record of 138 linked skydivers set on Saturday, 4 August 2012 also at Skydive Chicago.

Marc Hauser set the world record for the fastest horizontal free fall at 304 km/h in Empuriabrava, Spain without specialized equipment, in October 2012.

In 2022, skydivers from twenty-two different countries set a new all-female head-down world record with 80 free flyers in formation over Eloy USA. The first attempt at the record jump was scheduled to happen in 2020, the 100th anniversary of women being granted the right to vote, but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

<text>Andrew Inglis Clark (24 February 1848 – 14 November 1907) was an Australian founding father and co-author of the Australian Constitution; he was also an engineer, barrister, politician, electoral reformer and jurist. He initially qualified as an engineer, but he re-trained as a barrister to effectively fight for social causes which deeply concerned him. After a long political career, mostly spent as Attorney-General and briefly as Opposition Leader, he was appointed a Senior Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania. Despite being acknowledged as the leading expert on the Australian Constitution, he was never appointed to the High Court of Australia.

He popularised the Hare-Clark voting system, and introduced it to Tasmania. In addition Clark was a prolific author, though most of his writings were never published, rather they were circulated privately. Clark was also Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania. Throughout his life, Clark was a progressive. He championed the rights of workers to organise through trades unions, universal suffrage (including women&#x27;s suffrage) and the rights to a fair trial – all issues which today we take for granted, but were so radical in the 1880s that he was described as a &#x27;communist&#x27; by the &quot;Hobart Mercury&quot;.

In one summation, &quot;Clark was an Australian Jefferson, who, like the great American Republican, fought for Australian independence; an autonomous judiciary; a wider franchise and lower property qualifications; fairer electoral boundaries; checks and balances between the judicature, legislature and executive; modern, liberal universities; and a Commonwealth that was federal, independent and based on natural rights.&quot; Less favourably, a contemporary, J.B. Walker, privately judged him an &quot;eloquent, impressive, dignified ... doctrinaire politician ... wanting in practical ability&quot;.

Yet he also had a rich and warm home life. He is described as &quot;never too busy to mend a toy for a child, and his wife once wrote on hearing of his imminent return from America: &#x27;to celebrate your return I must do something or &quot;bust&quot;&#x27;&quot;.

The Australian federal Division of Clark is named after him.

==Early life and marriage==

Clark was born in Hobart, Tasmania, the son of a Scottish engineer, Alexander Clark. He was educated at Hobart High School. After leaving school, he was apprenticed to his family&#x27;s engineering business, becoming a qualified engineer, and finally its business manager. His father had established a highly successful engineering business, based on an iron foundry. The business was also involved with industrial design and construction of flour mills, water mills, coal mines and other substantial undertaking.

He grew to manhood during the 1860s, when the major issue, even in remote Tasmania, was the American Civil War and emancipation. This last issue had an especial resonance in Tasmania where a form of slavery, transportation, had been abolished as recently as 1853. Convicts were still a common sight for years later. As late as 1902, Clark would publicly be moved to tears when discussing slavery. Clark became fascinated by all things American.

In 1872, Clark disappointed his father by leaving to study law, becoming an articled clerk with R. P. Adams. He was called to the bar in 1877.

Clark, as a child attended a Baptist Sabbatical School until 1872 when the chapel was dissolved on a motion put by Clark due to the &quot;lack of discipline and proper order of government in worship.&quot; He then joined a Unitarian chapel, which led him into contact with leading American Unitarians, including Moncure Conway and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. The friendship formed with the latter would strongly influence his views and the development of the Clarks&#x27; draft of the Australian Constitution.

Early in his life, Clark developed a passion for justice and liberty. He joined the &quot;Minerva Club&quot; where he participated in debate on contemporary social issues. In 1874, he edited its journal &quot;Quadrilateral&quot;. As a &#x27;young ardent republican&#x27;, he was also a member of the &quot;American Club&quot;, where at the 1876 annual dinner, he declared &quot;We have met here tonight in the name of the principles which were proclaimed by the founders of the Anglo-American Republic... and we do so because we believe those principles to be permanently applicable to the politics of the world&quot;. He was inspired by Italian Risorgimento, especially by Joseph Mazzini of whom he had a picture in every room. He became a radical, a democrat and a republican.

In 1878 he married Grace Paterson (Ross) Clark, the daughter of local shipbuilder John Ross, with whom he had five sons and two daughters:

* Esma (1878)
* Alexander (1879) Marine engineer
* Andrew (1882) Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania 1928–1953.
* Conway (1883) Architect
* Wendell (1885) Doctor
* Melvyn (1886)
* Carrel (1888) Clerk of Tasmanian Legislative Council
* Ethel (1889)

One of the many mysteries of Clark&#x27;s private life is the circumstances of his marriage. As the son of a prominent family, and a leading figure of his church who was marrying the daughter of a well-known businessman, his marriage might have been expected to be a major social event. Instead, they slipped away to Melbourne, where they were married in the presence of a few friends.

==Political career==

In 1878, Clark stood for election to the House of Assembly, despite his reputation as an extreme ultra-republican. He was attacked by the Hobart &quot;Mercury&quot; for &quot;holding such very extreme ultra-republican, if not revolutionary, ideas&quot; that his proper place should be among the &#x27;Communists&#x27;, and the Launceston &quot;Examiner&quot; as a &quot;stranger from Hobart&quot;. He was elected, unopposed to the electorate of Norfolk Plains. His election was largely due to the influence of Thomas Reibey, a political power broker and a recent Premier.

Clark was the founder of the Southern Tasmania Political Reform Association, whose agenda included manhood suffrage, fixed term parliaments, and electoral reform. While a member of the House of Assembly, Clark was regarded as republican and ultra-progressive. He was one of the few members to legislate as a backbencher and introduce a private members bill. He failed to reform industrial law by amending the Master and Servant Act, but he succeeded with the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act in 1881. He also assisted with reframing the customs tariff.

In the 1882 election, Clark was defeated. He failed when he stood for election in 1884 (East Hobart) and 1886 (South Hobart). In 1887, Clark was re-elected, in a by-election as member for East Hobart. In 1888, he was re-elected as member for South Hobart and remained there until the seat was abolished in 1897. He was then the member for Hobart until he resigned upon his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1898.

In March 1888, he became Attorney General in the government of Sir Philip Fysh. Since the Premier was in the Legislative Council, Clark was responsible for introducing legislation into the Assembly. Over the next five years he shepherded through the lower house much progressive and humanitarian legislation. His goal was to break the power of property in Tasmanian politics. The legislation covered such diverse reforms as legalising trades unions, providing parliamentary salaries, preventing cruelty to animals, reforming laws on lunacy, trusteeship and companies, the custody of children and the protection of children from neglect and abuse. He also introduced laws to restrict the immigration of Chinese. Clark failed in his attempts to impose a land tax, introduce universal (including female) suffrage and centralise the police.

Clark was the most important 19th-century Attorney-General of Tasmania. His considerable drafting skills enabled him to modernise and simplify the law over a number of areas. He introduced a total of 228 bills into the Assembly. His best known achievement as Attorney-General was the introduction of proportional representation based on the Hare-Clark system of the single transferable vote.

One of the major political issues addressed by Clark during his career concerned the Tasmanian Main Line Railway – a railway which connected Tasmania&#x27;s two main cites, Hobart and Launceston. In 1873, the Main Line Railway Company began the construction of the line, which opened in 1876. There were a series of disputes between the Company and the government over payments due to the Company under its Deed of Concession. Clark had spoken about the problem, advocating the acquisition of the Company by the government as early as 1878. With his dual qualifications as both an engineer and a lawyer, Clark was in a unique position to understand the issues involved. As Attorney-General, he was the government&#x27;s chief negotiator.

In 1889, the Supreme Court awarded the Company arrears of interest. Clark urged the government to appeal, and in 1890 he went to England to argue the case before the Privy Council. Clark may have been a poor speaker in court, but he was a superb negotiator. It was his &quot;forte&quot;. With full powers, he settled the case out of court by arranging the purchase of the Company&#x27;s property by the government.

In 1891, Clark returned to Tasmania from London by way of the United States. It was a fateful choice. He was introduced to a fellow Unitarian Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., with whom he corresponded for the rest of his life. The contacts and people he met in Boston were to profoundly inform his views about political constitutions. Not the least of the consequences was the introduction of the term &quot;commonwealth&quot; to describe the Australian polity. This term is used in two ways: the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth of Australia.

In 1892, the fall of the Fysh government ended Clark&#x27;s term as Attorney-General. When Sir Edward Braddon formed a government in 1894, Clark again became Attorney-General, the same year he was given the title &#x27;Honourable&#x27; for life. He resigned in 1897, when his colleagues failed to consult him over the lease of Crown land to private interests, after which he became Leader of the Opposition. Clark left politics to become a Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in 1898.

==Clark and Australian Federation==

Clark positioned himself ambiguously with respect to the cause of Australian Federation. Clark was a delegate to the National Australasian Convention of 1891, and was a member of its committee which produced a draft constitution. However, he did not stand for the election of delegates to the Australian Federal Convention of 1897, and embarked on an overseas journey two days after it commenced. Instead of the Convention&#x27;s proposal to compensate States&#x27; for their loss of tariff revenue subsequent to Federation by a guarantee of a share of Commonwealth revenue, he favoured the Commonwealth&#x27;s assumption of States&#x27; debts. Despite the urgings of Federationists, Clark abstained from supporting the Federal cause in the subsequent campaign. A week before the 1898 referendum on Federation, he let it be known &quot;It is not his intention to advise any elector on how to vote&quot;.

==Hare–Clark electoral system==
In 1896, after several failed attempts, Clark was able to get a system of proportional representation adopted by the Tasmanian Parliament, but it was to be only on a trial basis for both Hobart (to elect 6 MPs) and Launceston (to elect 4 MPs). The modified single transferable vote method, immediately known as the Hare–Clark system, was renewed annually until suspended in 1902. Clark died in 1907, just as permanent proportional representation struggled through Parliament and over a year before it was used for the first time throughout Tasmania at the general election in April 1909.

==Early legal career==

Clark was called to the bar in 1877. He soon gained a reputation as a criminal lawyer in a &#x27;poisoning case&#x27;, but went on to gain a large practice in civil and commercial law as well. He practised law both while in and out of parliament. During those periods when he was not serving as Attorney-General, he worked hard to build a successful practice. He failed to find his fortune in the law due to his generosity and refusal &#x27;to accept anything beyond a reasonable and modest fee&#x27;. In 1887 he went into partnership with Matthew Wilkes Simmons.

His career in private practice gave him a broad grounding in the law which stood him in good stead once he was promoted to the bench. Clark was knowledgeable in all branches of the law, but pre-eminent as a constitutional lawyer and jurist.

Clark, never in robust health, in fact described as &quot;small, spare, [and] nervous&quot; by Alfred Deakin, died at his home &#x27;Rosebank&#x27; in Battery Point on 14 November 1907. He is buried in the old Queenborough Cemetery at Sandy Bay.

<text>Bell&#x27;s theorem is a term encompassing a number of closely related results in physics, all of which determine that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories, given some basic assumptions about the nature of measurement. &quot;Local&quot; here refers to the principle of locality, the idea that a particle can only be influenced by its immediate surroundings, and that interactions mediated by physical fields cannot propagate faster than the speed of light. &quot;Hidden variables&quot; are supposed properties of quantum particles that are not included in quantum theory but nevertheless affect the outcome of experiments. In the words of physicist John Stewart Bell, for whom this family of results is named, &quot;If [a hidden-variable theory] is local it will not agree with quantum mechanics, and if it agrees with quantum mechanics it will not be local.&quot;

The first such result was introduced by Bell in 1964, building upon the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox, which had called attention to the phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Bell deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair, then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. Such a constraint would later be named a Bell inequality. Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality. Multiple variations on Bell&#x27;s theorem were put forward in the following years, using different assumptions and obtaining different Bell (or &quot;Bell-type&quot;) inequalities.

The first rudimentary experiment designed to test Bell&#x27;s theorem was performed in 1972 by John Clauser and Stuart Freedman. More advanced experiments, known collectively as &quot;Bell tests&quot;, have been performed many times since. Often, these experiments have had the goal of &quot;closing loopholes&quot;, that is, ameliorating problems of experimental design or set-up that could in principle affect the validity of the findings of earlier Bell tests. Bell tests have consistently found that physical systems obey quantum mechanics and violate Bell inequalities; which is to say that the results of these experiments are incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. 

The exact nature of the assumptions required to prove a Bell-type constraint on correlations has been debated by physicists and by philosophers. While the significance of Bell&#x27;s theorem is not in doubt, different interpretations of quantum mechanics disagree about what exactly it implies.

==Theorem==
There are many variations on the basic idea, some employing stronger mathematical assumptions than others. Significantly, Bell-type theorems do not refer to any particular theory of local hidden variables, but instead show that quantum physics violates general assumptions behind classical pictures of nature. The original theorem proved by Bell in 1964 is not the most amenable to experiment, and it is convenient to introduce the genre of Bell-type inequalities with a later example.

Hypothetical characters Alice and Bob stand in widely separated locations. Their colleague Victor prepares a pair of particles and sends one to Alice and the other to Bob. When Alice receives her particle, she chooses to perform one of two possible measurements (perhaps by flipping a coin to decide which). Denote these measurements by formula_1 and formula_2. Both formula_1 and formula_2 are &quot;binary&quot; measurements: the result of formula_1 is either formula_6 or formula_7, and likewise for formula_2. When Bob receives his particle, he chooses one of two measurements, formula_9 and formula_10, which are also both binary.

Suppose that each measurement reveals a property that the particle already possessed. For instance, if Alice chooses to measure formula_1 and obtains the result formula_6, then the particle she received carried a value of formula_6 for a property formula_14. Consider the combinationformula_15Because both formula_14 and formula_17 take the values formula_18, then either formula_19 or formula_20. In the former case, the quantity formula_21 must equal 0, while in the latter case, formula_22. So, one of the terms on the right-hand side of the above expression will vanish, and the other will equal formula_23. Consequently, if the experiment is repeated over many trials, with Victor preparing new pairs of particles, the absolute value of the average of the combination formula_24 across all the trials will be less than or equal to 2. No &quot;single&quot; trial can measure this quantity, because Alice and Bob can only choose one measurement each, but on the assumption that the underlying properties exist, the average value of the sum is just the sum of the averages for each term. Using angle brackets to denote averagesformula_25
This is a Bell inequality, specifically, the CHSH inequality. Its derivation here depends upon two assumptions: first, that the underlying physical properties formula_26 and formula_27 exist independently of being observed or measured (sometimes called the assumption of &quot;realism&quot;); and second, that Alice&#x27;s choice of action cannot influence Bob&#x27;s result or vice versa (often called the assumption of &quot;locality&quot;).

Quantum mechanics can violate the CHSH inequality, as follows. Victor prepares a pair of qubits which he describes by the Bell stateformula_28
where formula_29 and formula_30 are the eigenstates of one of the Pauli matrices,formula_31
Victor then passes the first qubit to Alice and the second to Bob. Alice and Bob&#x27;s choices of possible measurements are also defined in terms of the Pauli matrices. Alice measures either of the two observables formula_32 and formula_33:formula_34
and Bob measures either of the two observablesformula_35
Victor can calculate the quantum expectation values for pairs of these observables using the Born rule:formula_36
While only one of these four measurements can be made in a single trial of the experiment, the sumformula_37
gives the sum of the average values that Victor expects to find across multiple trials. This value exceeds the classical upper bound of 2 that was deduced from the hypothesis of local hidden variables. The value formula_38 is in fact the largest that quantum physics permits for this combination of expectation values, making it a Tsirelson bound.
The CHSH inequality can also be thought of as a &quot;game&quot; in which Alice and Bob try to coordinate their actions. Victor prepares two bits, formula_39 and formula_40, independently and at random. He sends bit formula_39 to Alice and bit formula_40 to Bob. Alice and Bob win if they return answer bits formula_43 and formula_44 to Victor, satisfying
formula_45
Or, equivalently, Alice and Bob win if the logical AND of formula_39 and formula_40 is the logical XOR of formula_43 and formula_44. Alice and Bob can agree upon any strategy they desire before the game, but they cannot communicate once the game begins. In any theory based on local hidden variables, Alice and Bob&#x27;s probability of winning is no greater than formula_50, regardless of what strategy they agree upon beforehand. However, if they share an entangled quantum state, their probability of winning can be as large asformula_51

==Variations and related results==
===Bell (1964)===
Bell&#x27;s 1964 paper shows that a very simple local hidden-variable model can in restricted circumstances reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics, but then he demonstrates that, in general, such models give different predictions. Bell considers a refinement by David Bohm of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) thought experiment. In this scenario, a pair of particles are formed together in such a way that they are described by a spin singlet state (which is an example of an entangled state). The particles then move apart in opposite directions. Each particle is measured by a Stern–Gerlach device, a measuring instrument that can be oriented in different directions and that reports one of two possible outcomes, representable by formula_6 and formula_7. The configuration of each measuring instrument is represented by a unit vector, and the quantum-mechanical prediction for the correlation between two detectors with settings formula_54 and formula_55 is
formula_56
In particular, if the orientation of the two detectors is the same (formula_57), then the outcome of one measurement is certain to be the negative of the outcome of the other, giving formula_58. And if the orientations of the two detectors are orthogonal (formula_59), then the outcomes are uncorrelated, and formula_60. Bell proves by example that these special cases &quot;can&quot; be explained in terms of hidden variables, then proceeds to show that the full range of possibilities involving intermediate angles &quot;cannot&quot;.

Bell posited that a local hidden-variable model for these correlations would explain them in terms of an integral over the possible values of some hidden parameter formula_61:formula_62
where formula_63 is a probability density function. The two functions formula_64 and formula_65 provide the responses of the two detectors given the orientation vectors and the hidden variable:formula_66
Crucially, the outcome of detector formula_67 does not depend upon formula_55, and likewise the outcome of formula_69 does not depend upon formula_54, because the two detectors are physically separated. Now we suppose that the experimenter has a &quot;choice&quot; of settings for the second detector: it can be set either to formula_55 or to formula_72. Bell proves that the difference in correlation between these two choices of detector setting must satisfy the inequalityformula_73
However, it is easy to find situations where quantum mechanics violates the Bell inequality. For example, let the vectors formula_54 and formula_55 be orthogonal, and let formula_72 lie in their plane at a 45° angle from both of them. Thenformula_77
while
formula_78
but
formula_79
Therefore, there is no local hidden-variable model that can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics for all choices of formula_54, formula_55, and formula_82 Experimental results contradict the classical curves and match the curve predicted by quantum mechanics as long as experimental shortcomings are accounted for.

Bell&#x27;s 1964 theorem requires the possibility of perfect anti-correlations: the ability to make a completely certain prediction about the result from the second detector, knowing the result from the first. The theorem builds upon the &quot;EPR criterion of reality&quot;, a concept introduced in the 1935 paper by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. This paper posits: &quot;If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity.&quot; Bell noted that this applies when the two detectors are oriented in the same direction (formula_57), and so the EPR criterion would imply that some element of reality must predetermine the measurement result. Because the quantum description of a particle does not include any such element, the quantum description would have to be incomplete. In other words, Bell&#x27;s 1964 paper shows that, assuming locality, the EPR criterion implies hidden variables and then he demonstrates that local hidden variables are incompatible with quantum mechanics. Because experiments cannot achieve perfect correlations or anti-correlations in practice, Bell-type inequalities based on derivations that relax this assumption are tested instead.

===GHZ–Mermin (1990)===
Daniel Greenberger, Michael A. Horne, and Anton Zeilinger presented a four-particle thought experiment in 1990, which David Mermin then simplified to use only three particles. In this thought experiment, Victor generates a set of three spin-1/2 particles described by the quantum stateformula_84
where as above, formula_29 and formula_30 are the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrix formula_32. Victor then sends a particle each to Alice, Bob, and Charlie, who wait at widely separated locations. Alice measures either formula_33 or formula_89 on her particle, and so do Bob and Charlie. The result of each measurement is either formula_6 or formula_7. Applying the Born rule to the three-qubit state formula_92, Victor predicts that whenever the three measurements include one formula_33 and two formula_89&#x27;s, the product of the outcomes will always be formula_6. This follows because formula_92 is an eigenvector of formula_97 with eigenvalue formula_6, and likewise for formula_99 and formula_100. Therefore, knowing Alice&#x27;s result for a formula_33 measurement and Bob&#x27;s result for a formula_89 measurement, Victor can predict with probability 1 what result Charlie will return for a formula_89 measurement. According to the EPR criterion of reality, there would be an &quot;element of reality&quot; corresponding to the outcome of a formula_89 measurement upon Charlie&#x27;s qubit. Indeed, this same logic applies to both measurements and all three qubits. Per the EPR criterion of reality, then, each particle contains an &quot;instruction set&quot; that determines the outcome of a formula_33 or formula_89 measurement upon it. The set of all three particles would then be described by the instruction setformula_107
with each entry being either formula_7 or formula_6, and each formula_33 or formula_89 measurement simply returning the appropriate value.

If Alice, Bob, and Charlie all perform the formula_33 measurement, then the product of their results would be formula_113. This value can be deduced fromformula_114
because the square of either formula_7 or formula_6 is formula_117. Each factor in parentheses equals formula_6, soformula_119
and the product of Alice, Bob, and Charlie&#x27;s results will be formula_6 with probability unity. But this is inconsistent with quantum physics: Victor can predict using the state formula_92 that the measurement formula_122 will instead yield formula_7 with probability unity.

This thought experiment can also be recast as a traditional Bell inequality or, equivalently, as a nonlocal game in the same spirit as the CHSH game. In it, Alice, Bob, and Charlie receive bits formula_124 from Victor, promised to always have an even number of ones, that is, formula_125, and send him back bits formula_126. They win the game if formula_126 have an odd number of ones for all inputs except formula_128, when they need to have an even number of ones. That is, they win the game if and only if formula_129. With local hidden variables the highest probability of victory they can have is 3/4, whereas using the quantum strategy above they win it with certainty. This is an example of quantum pseudo-telepathy.

===Kochen–Specker theorem (1967)===

In quantum theory, orthonormal bases for a Hilbert space represent measurements that can be performed upon a system having that Hilbert space. Each vector in a basis represents a possible outcome of that measurement. Suppose that a hidden variable formula_61 exists, so that knowing the value of formula_61 would imply certainty about the outcome of any measurement. Given a value of formula_61, each measurement outcome – that is, each vector in the Hilbert space – is either &quot;impossible&quot; or &quot;guaranteed.&quot; A Kochen–Specker configuration is a finite set of vectors made of multiple interlocking bases, with the property that a vector in it will always be &quot;impossible&quot; when considered as belonging to one basis and &quot;guaranteed&quot; when taken as belonging to another. In other words, a Kochen–Specker configuration is an &quot;uncolorable set&quot; that demonstrates the inconsistency of assuming a hidden variable formula_61 can be controlling the measurement outcomes.

===Free will theorem===

The Kochen–Specker type of argument, using configurations of interlocking bases, can be combined with the idea of measuring entangled pairs that underlies Bell-type inequalities. This was noted beginning in the 1970s by Kochen, Heywood and Redhead, Stairs, and Brown and Svetlichny. As EPR pointed out, obtaining a measurement outcome on one half of an entangled pair implies certainty about the outcome of a corresponding measurement on the other half. The &quot;EPR criterion of reality&quot; posits that because the second half of the pair was not disturbed, that certainty must be due to a physical property belonging to it. In other words, by this criterion, a hidden variable formula_61 must exist within the second, as-yet unmeasured half of the pair. No contradiction arises if only one measurement on the first half is considered. However, if the observer has a choice of multiple possible measurements, and the vectors defining those measurements form a Kochen–Specker configuration, then some outcome on the second half will be simultaneously impossible and guaranteed.

This type of argument gained attention when an instance of it was advanced by John Conway and Simon Kochen under the name of the free will theorem. The Conway–Kochen theorem uses a pair of entangled qutrits and a Kochen–Specker configuration discovered by Asher Peres.

===Quasiclassical entanglement===

As Bell pointed out, some predictions of quantum mechanics can be replicated in local hidden-variable models, including special cases of correlations produced from entanglement. This topic has been studied systematically in the years since Bell&#x27;s theorem. In 1989, Reinhard Werner introduced what are now called Werner states, joint quantum states for a pair of systems that yield EPR-type correlations but also admit a hidden-variable model. Werner states are bipartite quantum states that are invariant under unitaries of symmetric tensor-product form: formula_135
In 2004, Robert Spekkens introduced a toy model that starts with the premise of local, discretized degrees of freedom and then imposes a &quot;knowledge balance principle&quot; that restricts how much an observer can know about those degrees of freedom, thereby making them into hidden variables. The allowed states of knowledge (&quot;epistemic states&quot;) about the underlying variables (&quot;ontic states&quot;) mimic some features of quantum states. Correlations in the toy model can emulate some aspects of entanglement, like monogamy, but by construction, the toy model can never violate a Bell inequality.

==History==
===Background===
The question of whether quantum mechanics can be &quot;completed&quot; by hidden variables dates to the early years of quantum theory. In his 1932 textbook on quantum mechanics, the Hungarian-born polymath John von Neumann presented what he claimed to be a proof that there could be no &quot;hidden parameters&quot;. The validity and definitiveness of von Neumann&#x27;s proof were questioned by Hans Reichenbach, in more detail by Grete Hermann, and possibly in conversation though not in print by Albert Einstein. (Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker rejected von Neumann&#x27;s key assumption as early as 1961, but did not publish a criticism of it until 1967.)

Einstein argued persistently that quantum mechanics could not be a complete theory. His preferred argument relied on a principle of locality:
:Consider a mechanical system constituted of two partial systems &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; which have interaction with each other only during limited time. Let the ψ function before their interaction be given. Then the Schrödinger equation will furnish the ψ function after their interaction has taken place. Let us now determine the physical condition of the partial system &quot;A&quot; as completely as possible by measurements. Then the quantum mechanics allows us to determine the ψ function of the partial system &quot;B&quot; from the measurements made, and from the ψ function of the total system. This determination, however, gives a result which depends upon &quot;which&quot; of the determining magnitudes specifying the condition of &quot;A&quot; has been measured (for instance coordinates &quot;or&quot; momenta). Since there can be only &quot;one&quot; physical condition of &quot;B&quot; after the interaction and which can reasonably not be considered as dependent on the particular measurement we perform on the system &quot;A&quot; separated from &quot;B&quot; it may be concluded that the ψ function is not unambiguously coordinated with the physical condition. This coordination of several ψ functions with the same physical condition of system &quot;B&quot; shows again that the ψ function cannot be interpreted as a (complete) description of a physical condition of a unit system.

The EPR thought experiment is similar, also considering two separated systems &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; described by a joint wave function. However, the EPR paper adds the idea later known as the EPR criterion of reality, according to which the ability to predict with probability 1 the outcome of a measurement upon &quot;B&quot; implies the existence of an &quot;element of reality&quot; within &quot;B&quot;.

In 1951, David Bohm proposed a variant of the EPR thought experiment in which the measurements have discrete ranges of possible outcomes, unlike the position and momentum measurements considered by EPR. The year before, Chien-Shiung Wu and Irving Shaknov had successfully measured polarizations of photons produced in entangled pairs, thereby making the Bohm version of the EPR thought experiment practically feasible.

By the late 1940s, the mathematician George Mackey had grown interested in the foundations of quantum physics, and in 1957 he drew up a list of postulates that he took to be a precise definition of quantum mechanics. Mackey conjectured that one of the postulates was redundant, and shortly thereafter, Andrew M. Gleason proved that it was indeed deducible from the other postulates. Gleason&#x27;s theorem provided an argument that a broad class of hidden-variable theories are incompatible with quantum mechanics. More specifically, Gleason&#x27;s theorem rules out hidden-variable models that are &quot;noncontextual&quot;. Any hidden-variable model for quantum mechanics must, in order to avoid the implications of Gleason&#x27;s theorem, involve hidden variables that are not properties belonging to the measured system alone but also dependent upon the external context in which the measurement is made. This type of dependence is often seen as contrived or undesirable; in some settings, it is inconsistent with special relativity. The Kochen–Specker theorem refines this statement by constructing a specific finite subset of rays on which no such probability measure can be defined.

Tsung-Dao Lee came close to deriving Bell&#x27;s theorem in 1960. He considered events where two kaons were produced traveling in opposite directions, and came to the conclusion that hidden variables could not explain the correlations that could be obtained in such situations. However, complications arose due to the fact that kaons decay, and he did not go so far as to deduce a Bell-type inequality.

===Bell&#x27;s publications===
Bell chose to publish his theorem in a comparatively obscure journal because it did not require page charges, in fact paying the authors who published there at the time. Because the journal did not provide free reprints of articles for the authors to distribute, however, Bell had to spend the money he received to buy copies that he could send to other physicists. While the articles printed in the journal themselves listed the publication&#x27;s name simply as &quot;Physics&quot;, the covers carried the trilingual version &quot;Physics Physique Физика&quot; to reflect that it would print articles in English, French and Russian.

Prior to proving his 1964 result, Bell also proved a result equivalent to the Kochen–Specker theorem (hence the latter is sometimes also known as the Bell–Kochen–Specker or Bell–KS theorem). However, publication of this theorem was inadvertently delayed until 1966. In that paper, Bell argued that because an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of hidden variables would require nonlocality, the EPR paradox &quot;is resolved in the way which Einstein would have liked least.&quot;

==Experiments==

In 1967, the unusual title &quot;Physics Physique Физика&quot; caught the attention of John Clauser, who then discovered Bell&#x27;s paper and began to consider how to perform a Bell test in the laboratory. Clauser and Stuart Freedman would go on to perform a Bell test in 1972. This was only a limited test, because the choice of detector settings was made before the photons had left the source. In 1982, Alain Aspect and collaborators performed the first Bell test to remove this limitation. This began a trend of progressively more stringent Bell tests. The GHZ thought experiment was implemented in practice, using entangled triplets of photons, in 2000. By 2002, testing the CHSH inequality was feasible in undergraduate laboratory courses.

In Bell tests, there may be problems of experimental design or set-up that affect the validity of the experimental findings. These problems are often referred to as &quot;loopholes&quot;. The purpose of the experiment is to test whether nature can be described by local hidden-variable theory, which would contradict the predictions of quantum mechanics.

The most prevalent loopholes in real experiments are the &quot;detection&quot; and &quot;locality&quot; loopholes. The detection loophole is opened when a small fraction of the particles (usually photons) are detected in the experiment, making it possible to explain the data with local hidden variables by assuming that the detected particles are an unrepresentative sample. The locality loophole is opened when the detections are not done with a spacelike separation, making it possible for the result of one measurement to influence the other without contradicting relativity. In some experiments there may be additional defects that make local-hidden-variable explanations of Bell test violations possible.

Although both the locality and detection loopholes had been closed in different experiments, a long-standing challenge was to close both simultaneously in the same experiment. This was finally achieved in three experiments in 2015.
Regarding these results, Alain Aspect writes that &quot;no experiment ... can be said to be totally loophole-free,&quot; but he says the experiments &quot;remove the last doubts that we should renounce&quot; local hidden variables, and refers to examples of remaining loopholes as being &quot;far fetched&quot; and &quot;foreign to the usual way of reasoning in physics.&quot;

These efforts to experimentally validate violations of the Bell inequalities would later result in Clauser, Aspect, and Anton Zeilinger being awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics.

== Interpretations ==

Reactions to Bell&#x27;s theorem have been many and varied. Maximilian Schlosshauer, Johannes Kofler, and Zeilinger write that Bell inequalities provide &quot;a wonderful example of how we can have a rigorous theoretical result tested by numerous experiments, and yet disagree about the implications.&quot;

=== The Copenhagen interpretation ===
Copenhagen-type interpretations generally take the violation of Bell inequalities as grounds to reject the assumption often called counterfactual definiteness or &quot;realism&quot;, which is not necessarily the same as abandoning realism in a broader philosophical sense. For example, Roland Omnès argues for the rejection of hidden variables and concludes that &quot;quantum mechanics is probably as realistic as any theory of its scope and maturity ever will be&quot;. Likewise, Rudolf Peierls took the message of Bell&#x27;s theorem to be that, because the premise of locality is physically reasonable, &quot;hidden variables cannot be introduced without abandoning some of the results of quantum mechanics&quot;.

This is also the route taken by interpretations that descend from the Copenhagen tradition, such as consistent histories (often advertised as &quot;Copenhagen done right&quot;), as well as QBism.

=== Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics ===

The Many-worlds interpretation, also known as the Everett interpretation, is dynamically local, meaning that it does not call for action at a distance, and deterministic, because it consists of the unitary part of quantum mechanics without collapse. It can generate correlations that violate a Bell inequality because it violates an implicit assumption by Bell that measurements have a single outcome. In fact, Bell&#x27;s theorem can be proven in the Many-Worlds framework from the assumption that a measurement has a single outcome. Therefore, a violation of a Bell inequality can be interpreted as a demonstration that measurements have multiple outcomes.

The explanation it provides for the Bell correlations is that when Alice and Bob make their measurements, they split into local branches. From the point of view of each copy of Alice, there are multiple copies of Bob experiencing different results, so Bob cannot have a definite result, and the same is true from the point of view of each copy of Bob. They will obtain a mutually well-defined result only when their future light cones overlap. At this point we can say that the Bell correlation starts existing, but it was produced by a purely local mechanism. Therefore, the violation of a Bell inequality cannot be interpreted as a proof of non-locality.

=== Non-local hidden variables ===

Most advocates of the hidden-variables idea believe that experiments have ruled out local hidden variables. They are ready to give up locality, explaining the violation of Bell&#x27;s inequality by means of a non-local hidden variable theory, in which the particles exchange information about their states. This is the basis of the Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which requires that all particles in the universe be able to instantaneously exchange information with all others. One challenge for non-local hidden variable theories is to explain why this instantaneous communication can exist at the level of the hidden variables, but it cannot be used to send signals. A 2007 experiment ruled out a large class of non-Bohmian non-local hidden variable theories, though not Bohmian mechanics itself.

The transactional interpretation, which postulates waves traveling both backwards and forwards in time, is likewise non-local.

===Superdeterminism===

A necessary assumption to derive Bell&#x27;s theorem is that the hidden variables are not correlated with the measurement settings. This assumption has been justified on the grounds that the experimenter has &quot;free will&quot; to choose the settings, and that it is necessary to do science in the first place. A (hypothetical) theory where the choice of measurement is necessarily correlated with the system being measured is known as &quot;superdeterministic&quot;.

A few advocates of deterministic models have not given up on local hidden variables. For example, Gerard &#x27;t Hooft has argued that superdeterminism cannot be dismissed.

<text>Mass is the main Eucharistic liturgical service in many forms of Western Christianity. The term &quot;Mass&quot; is commonly used in the Catholic Church, Western Rite Orthodoxy, Old Catholicism, and Independent Catholicism. The term is also used in many Lutheran churches, as well as in some Anglican churches, and on rare occasion by other Protestant churches.

Other Christian denominations may employ terms such as &quot;Divine Service&quot; or &quot;worship service&quot; (and often just &quot;service&quot;), rather than the word &quot;Mass&quot;. For the celebration of the Eucharist in Eastern Christianity, including Eastern Catholic Churches, other terms such as &quot;Divine Liturgy&quot;, &quot;Holy Qurbana&quot;, &quot;Holy Qurobo&quot; and &quot;Badarak&quot; (or &quot;Patarag&quot;) are typically used instead.

==Etymology==

The English noun &quot;Mass&quot; is derived from the Middle Latin . The Latin word was adopted in Old English as (via a Vulgar Latin form ), and was sometimes glossed as &quot;sendnes&quot; (i.e. &#x27;a sending, dismission&#x27;).

The Latin term itself was in use by the 6th century. It is most likely derived from the concluding formula (&quot;Go; the dismissal is made&quot;); here is a Late Latin substantive corresponding to classical .

Historically, however, there have been other etymological explanations of the noun that claim not to derive from the formula . Fortescue (1910) cites older, &quot;fanciful&quot; etymological explanations, notably a latinization of Hebrew () &quot;unleavened bread; oblation&quot;, a derivation favoured in the 16th century by Reuchlin and Luther, or Greek &quot;initiation&quot;, or even Germanic &quot;assembly&quot;. The French historian Du Cange in 1678 reported &quot;various opinions on the origin&quot; of the noun &quot;Mass&quot;, including the derivation from Hebrew (), here attributed to Caesar Baronius. The Hebrew derivation is learned speculation from 16th-century philology; medieval authorities did derive the noun from the verb , but not in connection with the formula . Thus, (9th century) explains the word as (&quot;from &#x27;sending&#x27;, because it sends us towards God&quot;), while Rupert of Deutz (early 12th century) derives it from a &quot;dismissal&quot; of the &quot;enmities which had been between God and men&quot; ().

== Order of the Mass ==

A distinction is made between texts that recur for every Mass celebration (, ordinary), and texts that are sung depending on the occasion (, proper).
== Catholic Church ==
 

The Catholic Church sees the Mass or Eucharist as &quot;the source and summit of the Christian life&quot;, to which the other sacraments are oriented. Remembered in the Mass are Jesus&#x27; life, Last Supper, and sacrificial death on the cross at Calvary. The ordained celebrant (priest or bishop) is understood to act &quot;in persona Christi&quot;, as he recalls the words and gestures of Jesus Christ at the Last Supper and leads the congregation in praise of God. The Mass is composed of two parts, the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist.

Although similar in outward appearance to the Anglican Mass or Lutheran Mass, the Catholic Church distinguishes between its own Mass and theirs on the basis of what it views as the validity of the orders of their clergy, and as a result, does not ordinarily permit intercommunion between members of these Churches. In a 1993 letter to Bishop Johannes Hanselmann of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria, Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) affirmed that &quot;a theology oriented to the concept of succession [of bishops], such as that which holds in the Catholic and in the Orthodox church, need not in any way deny the salvation-granting presence of the Lord [&quot;Heilschaffende Gegenwart des Herrn&quot;] in a Lutheran [&quot;evangelische&quot;] Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;. The Decree on Ecumenism, produced by Vatican II in 1964, records that the Catholic Church notes its understanding that when other faith groups (such as Lutherans, Anglicans, and Presbyterians) &quot;commemorate His death and resurrection in the Lord&#x27;s Supper, they profess that it signifies life in communion with Christ and look forward to His coming in glory&quot;.

Within the fixed structure outlined below, which is specific to the Roman Rite, the Scripture readings, the antiphons sung or recited during the entrance procession or at Communion, and certain other prayers vary each day according to the liturgical calendar.

===Introductory rites===
The priest enters, with a deacon if there is one, and altar servers (who may act as crucifer, candle-bearers and thurifer). The priest makes the sign of the cross with the people and formally greets them. Of the options offered for the Introductory Rites, that preferred by liturgists would bridge the praise of the opening hymn with the Glory to God which follows. The &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; here has from early times been an acclamation of God&#x27;s mercy. The Penitential Act instituted by the Council of Trent is also still permitted here, with the caution that it should not turn the congregation in upon itself during these rites which are aimed at uniting those gathered as one praiseful congregation. The Introductory Rites are brought to a close by the Collect Prayer.

===Liturgy of the Word===
On Sundays and solemnities, three Scripture readings are given. On other days there are only two. If there are three readings, the first is from the Old Testament (a term wider than &quot;Hebrew Scriptures&quot;, since it includes the Deuterocanonical Books), or the Acts of the Apostles during Eastertide. The first reading is followed by a psalm, recited or sung responsorially. The second reading is from the New Testament epistles, typically from one of the Pauline epistles. A Gospel acclamation is then sung as the Book of the Gospels is processed, sometimes with incense and candles, to the ambo; if not sung it may be omitted. The final reading and high point of the Liturgy of the Word is the proclamation of the Gospel by the deacon or priest. On all Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation, and preferably at all Masses, a homily or sermon that draws upon some aspect of the readings or the liturgy itself, is then given. The homily is preferably moral and hortatory. Finally, the Nicene Creed or, especially from Easter to Pentecost, the Apostles&#x27; Creed is professed on Sundays and solemnities, and the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful follows. The designation &quot;of the faithful&quot; comes from when catechumens did not remain for this prayer or for what follows.

===Liturgy of the Eucharist===
The Liturgy of the Eucharist begins with the preparation of the altar and gifts, while the collection may be taken. This concludes with the priest saying: &quot;Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.&quot; The congregation stands and responds: &quot;May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands, for the praise and glory of His name, for our good, and the good of all His holy Church.&quot; The priest then pronounces the variable prayer over the gifts.

Then in dialogue with the faithful the priest brings to mind the meaning of &quot;eucharist&quot;, to give thanks to God. A variable prayer of thanksgiving follows, concluding with the acclamation &quot;Holy, Holy ...Heaven and earth are full of your glory. ...Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.&quot; The anaphora, or more properly &quot;Eucharistic Prayer&quot;, follows, The oldest of the anaphoras of the Roman Rite, fixed since the Council of Trent, is called the Roman Canon, with central elements dating to the fourth century. With the liturgical renewal following the Second Vatican Council, numerous other Eucharistic prayers have been composed, including four for children&#x27;s Masses. Central to the Eucharist is the Institution Narrative, recalling the words and actions of Jesus at his Last Supper, which he told his disciples to do in remembrance of him. Then the congregation acclaims its belief in Christ&#x27;s conquest over death, and their hope of eternal life. Since the early church an essential part of the Eucharistic prayer has been the epiclesis, the calling down of the Holy Spirit to sanctify our offering. The priest concludes with a doxology in praise of God&#x27;s work, at which the people give their Amen to the whole Eucharistic prayer.

===Communion rite===

All together recite or sing the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (&quot;Pater Noster&quot; or &quot;Our Father&quot;). The priest introduces it with a short phrase and follows it up with a prayer called the embolism, after which the people respond with another doxology. The sign of peace is exchanged and then the &quot;Lamb of God&quot; (&quot;Agnus Dei&quot; in Latin) litany is sung or recited while the priest breaks the host and places a piece in the main chalice; this is known as the rite of fraction and commingling.

The priest then displays the consecrated elements to the congregation, saying: &quot;Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb,&quot; to which all respond: &quot;Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.&quot; Then Communion is given, often with lay ministers assisting with the consecrated wine. According to Catholic teaching, one should be in the state of grace, without mortal sin, to receive Communion. Singing by all the faithful during the Communion procession is encouraged &quot;to express the communicants&#x27; union in spirit&quot; from the bread that makes them one. A silent time for reflection follows, and then the variable concluding prayer of the Mass.

===Concluding rite===
The priest imparts a blessing over those present. The deacon or, in his absence, the priest himself then dismisses the people, choosing a formula by which the people are &quot;sent forth&quot; to spread the good news. The congregation responds: &quot;Thanks be to God.&quot; A recessional hymn is sung by all, as the ministers process to the rear of the church.

==Western Rite Orthodox Churches==
Since most Eastern Orthodox Christians use the Byzantine Rite, most Eastern Orthodox Churches call their Eucharistic service &quot;the Divine Liturgy.&quot; However, there are a number of parishes within the Eastern Orthodox Church which use an edited version of Latin liturgical rites. Most parishes use the &quot;Divine Liturgy of St. Tikhon&quot; which is a revision of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, or &quot;the Divine Liturgy of St. Gregory&quot; which is derived from the Tridentine form of the Roman Rite Mass. These rubrics have been revised to reflect the doctrine and dogmas of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Therefore, the filioque clause has been removed, a fuller epiclesis has been added, and the use of leavened bread has been introduced.

==Lutheranism==

In the Book of Concord, Article XXIV (&quot;Of the Mass&quot;) of the Augsburg Confession (1530) begins thus: Falsely are our churches accused of abolishing the Mass; for the Mass is retained among us, and celebrated with the highest reverence. We do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. [...] We keep the traditional liturgical form. [...] In our churches Mass is celebrated every Sunday and on other holy days, when the sacrament is offered to those who wish for it after they have been examined and absolved (Article XXIV).

Martin Luther rejected parts of the Roman Rite Mass, specifically the Canon of the Mass, which, as he argued, did not conform with . That verse contrasts the Old Testament priests, who needed to make a sacrifice for sins on a regular basis, with the single priest Christ, who offers his body only once as a sacrifice. The theme is carried out also in , , and . Luther composed as a replacement a revised Latin-language rite, &quot;Formula missae,&quot; in 1523, and the vernacular Deutsche Messe in 1526.

Scandinavian, Finnish, and some English speaking Lutherans, use the term &quot;Mass&quot; for their Eucharistic service, but in most German and English-speaking churches, the terms &quot;Divine Service&quot;, &quot;Holy Communion, or &quot;the Holy Eucharist&quot; are used.

Lutheran churches often celebrate the Eucharist each Sunday, if not at every worship service. This aligns with Luther&#x27;s preference and the Lutheran confessions. Also, eucharistic ministers take the sacramental elements to the sick in hospitals and nursing homes. The practice of weekly Communion is increasingly the norm again in most Lutheran parishes throughout the world. The bishops and pastors of the larger Lutheran bodies have strongly encouraged this restoration of the weekly Mass.

==Anglicanism==

In the Anglican tradition, &quot;Mass&quot; is one of many terms for the Eucharist. More frequently, the term used is either &quot;Holy Communion&quot;, &quot;Holy Eucharist&quot;, or the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;. Occasionally the term used in Eastern churches, the &quot;Divine Liturgy&quot;, is also used. In the English-speaking Anglican world, the term used often identifies the Eucharistic theology of the person using it. &quot;Mass&quot; is frequently used by Anglo-Catholics.

===Structure of the rite===
The various Eucharistic liturgies used by national churches of the Anglican Communion have continuously evolved from the 1549 and 1552 editions of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, both of which owed their form and contents chiefly to the work of Thomas Cranmer, who in about 1547 had rejected the medieval theology of the Mass. Although the 1549 rite retained the traditional sequence of the Mass, its underlying theology was Cranmer&#x27;s and the four-day debate in the House of Lords during December 1548 makes it clear that this had already moved far beyond traditional Catholicism. In the 1552 revision, this was made clear by the restructuring of the elements of the rite while retaining nearly all the language so that it became, in the words of an Anglo-Catholic liturgical historian (Arthur Couratin) &quot;a series of communion devotions; disembarrassed of the Mass with which they were temporarily associated in 1548 and 1549&quot;. Some rites, such as the 1637 Scottish rite and the 1789 rite in the United States, went back to the 1549 model. From the time of the Elizabethan Settlement in 1559 the services allowed for a certain variety of theological interpretation. Today&#x27;s rites generally follow the same general five-part shape. Some or all of the following elements may be altered, transposed or absent depending on the rite, the liturgical season and use of the province or national church:

* Gathering: Begins with a Trinitarian-based greeting or seasonal acclamation (&quot;Blessed be God: Father, Son and Holy spirit. And Blessed be his kingdom, now and forever. Amen&quot;). Then the Kyrie and a general confession and absolution follow. On Sundays outside Advent and Lent and on major festivals, the is sung or said. The entrance rite then concludes with the collect of the day.
* Proclaiming and Hearing the Word: Usually two to three readings of Scripture, one of which is always from the Gospels, plus a psalm (or portion thereof) or canticle between the lessons. This is followed by a sermon or homily; the recitation of one of the Creeds, viz., the Apostles&#x27; or Nicene, is done on Sundays and feasts.
* The Prayers of the People: Quite varied in their form.
* The Peace: The people stand and greet one another and exchange signs of God&#x27;s peace in the name of the Lord. It functions as a bridge between the prayers, lessons, sermon and creeds to the Communion part of the Eucharist.
*The Celebration of the Eucharist: The gifts of bread and wine are brought up, along with other gifts (such as money or food for a food bank, etc.), and an offertory prayer is recited. Following this, a Eucharistic Prayer (called &quot;The Great Thanksgiving&quot;) is offered. This prayer consists of a dialogue (the Sursum Corda), a preface, the sanctus and benedictus, the Words of Institution, the Anamnesis, an Epiclesis, a petition for salvation, and a Doxology. The Lord&#x27;s Prayer precedes the fraction (the breaking of the bread), followed by the Prayer of Humble Access or the Agnus Dei and the distribution of the sacred elements (the bread and wine).
*Dismissal: There is a post-Communion prayer, which is a general prayer of thanksgiving. The service concludes with a Trinitarian blessing and the dismissal.

The liturgy is divided into two main parts: The Liturgy of the Word (Gathering, Proclaiming and Hearing the Word, Prayers of the People) and the Liturgy of the Eucharist (together with the Dismissal), but the entire liturgy itself is also properly referred to as the Holy Eucharist. The sequence of the liturgy is almost identical to the Roman Rite, except the Confession of Sin ends the Liturgy of the Word in the Anglican rites in North America, while in the Roman Rite (when used) and in Anglican rites in many jurisdictions the Confession is near the beginning of the service.

===Special Masses===
The Anglican tradition includes separate rites for nuptial, funeral, and votive Masses. The Eucharist is an integral part of many other sacramental services, including ordination and Confirmation.

===Ceremonial===
Some Anglo-Catholic parishes use Anglican versions of the Tridentine Missal, such as the &quot;English Missal&quot;, &quot;The Anglican Missal&quot;, or the &quot;American Missal&quot;, for the celebration of Mass, all of which are intended primarily for the celebration of the Eucharist, or use the order for the Eucharist in &quot;Common Worship&quot; arranged according to the traditional structure, and often with interpolations from the Roman Rite. In the Episcopal Church (United States), a traditional-language, Anglo-Catholic adaptation of the 1979 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; has been published (&quot;An Anglican Service Book&quot;).

All of these books contain such features as meditations for the presiding celebrant(s) during the liturgy, and other material such as the rite for the blessing of palms on Palm Sunday, propers for special feast days, and instructions for proper ceremonial order. These books are used as a more expansively Catholic context in which to celebrate the liturgical use found in the Book of Common Prayer and related liturgical books. In England supplementary liturgical texts for the proper celebration of Festivals, Feast days and the seasons is provided in &quot;Common Worship; Times and Seasons&quot; (2013), &quot;Festivals (Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England)&quot; (2008) and &quot;Common Worship: Holy Week and Easter&quot; (2011).

These are often supplemented in Anglo-Catholic parishes by books specifying ceremonial actions, such as &quot;A Priest&#x27;s Handbook&quot; by Dennis G. Michno, &quot;Ceremonies of the Eucharist&quot; by Howard E. Galley, &quot;&quot; by C. P. A. Burnett, and &quot;Ritual Notes&quot; by E.C.R. Lamburn. Other guides to ceremonial include the &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot;, &quot;Ceremonies of the Modern Roman Rite&quot; (Peter Elliott), &quot;Ceremonies of the Roman Rite Described&quot; (Adrian Fortescue), and &quot;The Parson&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (Percy Dearmer). In Evangelical Anglican parishes, the rubrics detailed in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; are sometimes considered normative.

==Methodism==

The celebration of the &quot;Mass&quot; in Methodist churches, commonly known as the Service of the Table, is based on &quot;The Sunday Service&quot; of 1784, a revision of the liturgy of the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; authorized by John Wesley. The use of the term &quot;Mass&quot; is very rare in Methodism. The terms &quot;Holy Communion&quot;, &quot;Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;, and to a lesser extent &quot;Eucharist&quot; are far more typical.

The celebrant of a Methodist Eucharist must be an ordained or licensed minister. In the Free Methodist Church, the liturgy of the Eucharist, as provided in its &quot;Book of Discipline,&quot; is outlined as follows:
*The Invitation: You who truly and earnestly repent of your sins, who live in love and peace with your neighbors and who intend to lead a new life, following the commandments of God and walking in His holy ways, draw near with faith, and take this holy sacrament to your comfort; and humbly kneeling, make your honest confession to Almighty God.
*General Confession
*Lord&#x27;s Prayer
*Affirmation of Faith
*Collect
*Sanctus
**Gloria Patri
*Prayer of Humble Access
*Prayer of Consecration of the Elements
*Benediction
Methodist services of worship, post-1992, reflect the ecumenical movement and Liturgical Movement, particularly the &quot;Methodist Mass&quot;, largely the work of theologian Donald C. Lacy.

== Calendrical usage ==

The English suffix &quot;&quot; (equivalent to modern English &quot;Mass&quot;) can label certain prominent (originally religious) feasts or seasons based on a traditional liturgical year. For example:
* Candlemas
* Childermas
* Christmas

* Hallowmas
* Johnmas
* Lammas

* Martinmas
* Michelmas

<text>Framing error can refer to the following:
*General form of a framing error is the result of starting to read a sequence of data at the wrong point.
*In serial communications, a framing error is the result of reading a data frame – a string of symbols which are grouped in blocks – at the wrong starting point. The symbols are bits and the blocks are bytes, ten bits in asynchronous transmission and eight in synchronous. A framing error in an asynchronous stream usually recovers quickly, but a framing error in a synchronous stream produces gibberish at the end of the packet. Framing errors can be detected with parity bits.
* In genetics, a framing error (also called a frameshift or a frameshift mutation) is a mutation that inserts or deletes a single nucleotide from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression, the insertion/deletion can disrupt the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different translation from the original.
* In psychology, the framing effect (psychology) is an example of cognitive bias in which people react to a particular choice in different ways depending on how it is presented. Cognitive errors as a result of this bias are commonly called framing errors.</text><links>

<doc id="56374" wikidata="Q2391397" url="?curid=56374" title="List of major opera composers">
<text>This list provides a guide to opera composers, as determined by their presence on a majority of compiled lists of significant opera composers. (See the &quot;Lists Consulted&quot; section for full details.) The composers run from Jacopo Peri, who wrote the first ever opera in late 16th century Italy, to John Adams, one of the leading figures in the contemporary operatic world. The brief accompanying notes offer an explanation as to why each composer has been considered major. Also included is a section about major women opera composers, compiled from the same lists. For an introduction to operatic history, see opera. The organisation of the list is by birthdate.

== Major opera composers ==
=== 1550–1699 ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
* Jacopo Peri (1561–1633) Florentine who composed both the first opera ever, &quot;Dafne&quot; (1598), and the first surviving opera, &quot;Euridice&quot; (1600).
* Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643) Generally regarded as the first major opera composer. In &quot;Orfeo&quot; (1607) he blended Peri&#x27;s experiments in opera with the lavish spectacle of the intermedi. Later, in Venice in the 1640s, he helped make opera a commercially viable form with &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;, one of the earliest operas in the present-day operatic repertoire.
* Francesco Cavalli (1602–1676) Amongst the most important of Monteverdi&#x27;s successors, Cavalli was a major force in spreading opera throughout Italy and also helped introduce it to France. His &quot;Giasone&quot; was &quot;&quot; the most popular opera of the 17th century&quot;.&quot;
* Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632–1687) In close collaboration with the librettist Philippe Quinault, Lully founded the tradition of &quot;tragédie en musique&quot;, combining singing, dance and visual spectacle, which would remain the most prestigious French operatic genre for almost a hundred years. &quot;Cadmus et Hermione&quot; (1673) is often regarded as the first example of French opera.
* Henry Purcell (1659–1695) First English operatic composer of significance. His masterwork is &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;.
* Alessandro Scarlatti (1660–1725) Key figure in the development of opera seria, Scarlatti claimed to have composed over 100 operas, of which &quot;La Griselda&quot; is a notable example.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
* Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683–1764) Most important French opera composer of the 18th century. Following in the genre established by Lully, he endowed his works with a great richness of invention. Rameau&#x27;s musical daring provoked great controversy in his day, but he was an important influence on Gluck.
* Johann Christoph Pepusch (1667–1752) Arranger of the first English ballad opera, the biting political satire, &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;.
* George Frideric Handel (1685–1759) Handel&#x27;s &quot;opera serie&quot; set the standard in his day. Handel composed a series of over 30 operas.

=== 1700–1799 ===

* Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710–1736) Though Pergolesi also composed opera serias, his most influential work was the short opera buffa, &quot;La serva padrona&quot;.
* Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714–1787) Was a key figure in the transformation of Baroque into Classical opera, paving the way for Mozart, though his influence stretched much further into the 19th century, with both Berlioz and Wagner acknowledging their debt to him. In his &quot;reform operas&quot; from &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; onwards, he sought to throw off the formal conventions of &quot;opera seria&quot; and write music of &quot;beautiful simplicity&quot; (his own words).
* Joseph Haydn (1732–1809) Haydn wrote nineteen operas including several comic operas and singspiels.
* Giovanni Paisiello (1740–1816) Italian composer who wrote the first opera to include Beaumarchais&#x27; character Figaro as a main character, as well as writing a substantial number of other operas, some of them in St. Petersburg.
* André Grétry (1741–1813) Liège (present day Belgian) composer crucial to the development of French &quot;opéra comique&quot;, whose simplicity of musical style and sophisticated dramaturgy were immensely popular, as well as linking pre-revolutionary rococo comedy to the later romantic style. 
* Domenico Cimarosa (1749–1801) Italian composer most famous for the opera buffa, &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot;, which forms a bridge between the comedies of Mozart and Rossini.
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) Mozart&#x27;s series of comic collaborations (&quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;) with Lorenzo Da Ponte are among the most popular operas in the repertoire today, along with his Singspiel &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;.
*Antonio Salieri (1750–1825) Italian composer who was a major contributor to and shaper of Viennese musical life from 1770 to 1820, he also composed successful operas in Italy and Paris, and won admiration from German operagoers as a composer who, in the words of one contemporary critic, ‘could bind all the power of German music to the sweet Italian style’. His opera &quot;Europa riconosciuta&quot; was composed for the inauguration of La Scala. Among his other most successful operas were &quot;Les Danaïdes&quot;, &quot;Axur, re d&#x27;Ormus&quot; (the Italian version of French &quot;Tarare&quot;) and &quot;Falstaff&quot;.
* Luigi Cherubini (1760–1842) Follower of Gluck, Cherubini&#x27;s most famous opera is &quot;Médée&quot;. The title role has proved a challenge to sopranos (including Maria Callas) since its premiere in 1797.
* Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827) Wrote only one opera, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, a tale of freedom from political oppression, which has become one of the major German language operas.
* Gaspare Spontini (1774–1851) Though Italian, Spontini is best known for his work in France during the Napoleonic era. His masterpiece &quot;La vestale&quot; influenced Bellini and Berlioz.
* Daniel Auber (1782–1871) French composer celebrated for high-spirited &quot;opéra comiques&quot; such as &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; and &quot;Le domino noir&quot;. His grand opera &quot;La muette de Portici&quot; attained unexpected political influence when a performance in Brussels in 1830 sparked off a revolution which led to the creation of Belgium.
* Carl Maria von Weber (1786–1826) Founded German Romantic opera in order to challenge the dominance of Italian bel canto. Master of orchestral colour and atmosphere, Weber was never well served by his librettists, and only one of his works, &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, is performed with any frequency. Though he died young, his influence on later German composers, especially Wagner, was immense.
* Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791–1864) The archetypal composer of French grand opera, Meyerbeer&#x27;s huge extravaganzas such as &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; and &quot;Le prophète&quot; were immensely popular in their day.
* Gioachino Rossini (1792–1868) Links bel canto with grand opera. His immortal &quot;Barber of Seville&quot; was the only one of his operas that was continuously performed into the 20th century, but his serious operas, such as &quot;Semiramide&quot; and &quot;Ermione&quot;, are recognised as masterpieces now that singers with appropriate technique are again available to perform them. &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, his swan-song, has a vast sweep only equalled in the 19th century by the later works of Verdi, Mussorgsky and Wagner.
*Heinrich Marschner (1795–1861) German composer who was the most important exponent of German Romantic opera in the generation between Weber and Wagner. His most successful operas were &quot;Hans Heiling&quot;, &quot;Der Vampyr&quot; and &quot;Der Templer und die Jüdin&quot;.
* Gaetano Donizetti (1797–1848) Along with Rossini and Bellini, Donizetti is generally acknowledged as one of the masters of the &quot;bel canto&quot; style. His masterwork is generally cited as being &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;.
* Fromental Halévy (1799–1862) Along with Meyerbeer, the best known composer of French grand opera, Halévy&#x27;s key work is &quot;La Juive&quot;, a story of religious intolerance set in 15th century Switzerland.

=== 1800–1849 ===

* Vincenzo Bellini (1801–1835) On account of such works as &quot;Norma&quot; and &quot;I puritani&quot;, Bellini is recognised as one of the leading composers of the &quot;bel canto&quot; style of opera.
* Hector Berlioz (1803–1869) Berlioz&#x27;s attempts to carve out an operatic career for himself were thwarted by an unimaginative musical establishment. Nevertheless, he managed to produce &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; and his masterpiece, the epic &quot;Les Troyens&quot;. Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;dramatic legend&quot;, &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;, has also been staged as an opera in recent years.
* Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857) Founded the Russian operatic tradition with his historical drama &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; and his fairy tale piece &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot;.
* Michael William Balfe (1808–1870) Irish composer, his opera &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot; is notable for its Arline&#x27;s aria Gipsy Girl&#x27;s Dream. 
* Ambroise Thomas (1811–1896) French composer noted for the operas &quot;Mignon&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;.
* George Alexander Macfarren (1813–1887) English composer noted for the operas &quot;Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;Helvellyn&quot;. 
* Richard Wagner (1813–1883) Wagner revolutionised opera. In a series of &quot;music dramas&quot; such as &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, &quot;Parsifal&quot;, and most of all his epic tetralogy &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, Wagner abolished the traditional distinction between recitative and aria and pioneered a new through-composed style of opera.
* Giuseppe Verdi (1813–1901) Had a long composing career, during which his compositional style kept evolving. Among his most famous works are &quot;Nabucco&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, and &quot;Otello&quot;.
* Charles Gounod (1818–1893) Wrote lyrical operas on literary themes, including &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; and &quot;Mireille&quot;. His &quot;Faust&quot; still holds the stage today, in spite of criticisms of its &quot;Victorianism&quot;.

* Jacques Offenbach (1819–1880) Founder of French operetta and a prolific composer of pieces which achieved tremendous success with Parisian audiences for their catchy melodies and satirical bite such as &quot;La Vie parisienne&quot; and &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;. At the time of his death, Offenbach was working on a more serious opera, &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;.
* Bedřich Smetana (1824–1884) Established Czech national opera with such historical epics as &quot;Dalibor&quot;. His folk comedy &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; has entered the international repertory.
* Alexander Borodin (1833–1887) A &quot;weekend composer&quot; who spent 17 years working on a single opera, &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, which now forms a key part of the Russian repertory.
* Camille Saint-Saëns (1835–1921). French composer of around a dozen operas of which one, the Biblical &quot;Samson et Delila&quot;, is still performed.
* Léo Delibes (1836–1891) French composer, whose &quot;Lakmé&quot; is notable for its Flower Duet and as a vehicle for coloratura sopranos.
* Georges Bizet (1838–1875) Bizet&#x27;s masterwork &quot;Carmen&quot; is a staple of the repertoire of opera houses the world over. At the time of its premiere, the controversial plot scandalised both critics and the public.
* Modest Mussorgsky (1839–1881) Mussorgsky completed only one opera, but &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; proved to be inspiration for generations of Russian composers on account of its uniquely nationalist character.
* Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–1893) Tchaikovsky&#x27;s international fame as an opera composer mainly rests on two works, &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; and &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;. Less interested in cultivating a uniquely Russian style than his contemporary Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky also shows the influence of Mozart, bel canto and Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; in these pieces.
* Emmanuel Chabrier (1841–1894) Had ambitions to write grand operas in the Wagnerian vein, but is now most celebrated for lighter pieces, such as &quot;L&#x27;étoile&quot; and &quot;Le roi malgré lui&quot;, which were greatly admired by Ravel and Poulenc.
* Antonín Dvořák (1841–1904) Leading Czech opera composer between Smetana and Janáček. His &quot;Rusalka&quot;, based on the Undine legend, is his most popular work internationally.
* Jules Massenet (1842–1912) Arguably the most representative French opera composer of his era (the &quot;Belle Époque&quot;), Massenet was a prolific and versatile writer whose works cover a wide variety of themes. His popularity faded somewhat after the First World War, but &quot;Werther&quot; and &quot;Manon&quot; still make regular appearances in the opera house.
* Arthur Sullivan (1842–1900) English composer who is best known for his series of 14 operatic collaborations with the dramatist W. S. Gilbert, including such enduring works as &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;.
* Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844–1908) Russian composer who wrote colourful operas on legendary and historical subjects.

=== 1850–1899 ===

* Leoš Janáček (1854–1928) Janáček&#x27;s first mature opera (&quot;Jenůfa&quot;) blended folksong-like melodies and an emphasis on natural speech-rhythms à la Mussorgsky with a character-driven plot of some intensity; his later works became increasingly terse, with recurrent melodic fragments, lyrical outbursts and unconventional orchestration serving a diverse collection of source-material – just a few bars of these operas can instantly be identified as his.
* Ruggero Leoncavallo (1857–1919) Italian composer associated with verismo. His &quot;Pagliacci&quot; is a staple of the operatic repertoire and is usually given alongside Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;.
* Giacomo Puccini (1858–1924) The only true successor to Giuseppe Verdi in Italian opera, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; are among the most popular and well-recognised in the repertoire today.
* Gustave Charpentier (1860–1956) French composer famous for a single opera, &quot;Louise&quot;, set in a working class district of Paris.
* Claude Debussy (1862–1918) Like Beethoven, Debussy finished only one opera, but his setting of Maeterlinck&#x27;s Symbolist play &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; is a key work in 20th century music drama. In many ways an &quot;anti-opera&quot;, &quot;Pelléas&quot; contained little of the conventional singing or action audiences at the première had come to expect, but Debussy used his subtle orchestration to create an elusive, dream-like atmosphere, which still has the power to fascinate listeners today.
* Pietro Mascagni (1863–1945) Italian composer, famous above all for &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, usually given in a double-bill with Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;.
* Richard Strauss (1864–1949) Strauss was one of very few opera composers in the early years of the 20th century to accept and conquer the challenge laid down by the scale and radical nature of Wagner&#x27;s innovative works. He composed several operas that remain extremely popular today, including &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;Elektra&quot;, and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;.
* Hans Pfitzner (1869–1949) A follower of Wagner, Pfitzner is best known for the opera &quot;Palestrina&quot; which explores the debate between tradition and innovation in music.
* Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) A leading Modernist composer and the deviser of the twelve-tone system, Schoenberg began his operatic career with the Expressionist monodrama &quot;Erwartung&quot;. His major opera &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; was left unfinished at his death.
* Maurice Ravel (1875–1937) Wrote two short, but innovative, operas: &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot;, set in the world of childhood, and the Spanish-flavoured &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot;.
* Franz Schreker (1878–1934) Austrian composer associated with Expressionism, Schreker once rivalled Richard Strauss in popularity but, as a Jew, he fell foul of the Nazis. His operas include &quot;Der ferne Klang&quot; and &quot;Die Gezeichneten&quot;.
* Béla Bartók (1881–1945) Wrote only one opera, &quot;Duke Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot;, a key piece in 20th century music theatre and the only Hungarian work with a secure place in the international operatic repertoire.
* Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971) After composing the Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired &quot;The Nightingale&quot; and the near-operas &quot;Renard&quot; and &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Stravinsky bucked 20th century trends by composing a &quot;number&quot; opera, &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, using diatonicism.
* Alban Berg (1885–1935) Because of their atonal music which uses tonal conventions harkening back to late romanticism and tragic libretti, Berg&#x27;s masterworks &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot; have stayed in the repertory and assumed increased popularity after his death.
* Sergei Prokofiev (1891–1953) Major modern composer in the Russian tradition, Prokofiev produced operas on a wide variety of subjects, from the comic fairy-tale &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;, to the dark and occult &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot; and the epic &quot;War and Peace&quot;. Like Shostakovich, Prokofiev suffered under the Soviet artistic regime, but his work has recently been championed by conductors such as Valery Gergiev.
* Paul Hindemith (1895–1963) German composer who came to prominence in the years following World War I. His key opera &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot;, dealing with the problems of an artist in a time of crisis, has been seen as an allegory of Hindemith&#x27;s situation during the Third Reich.
* George Gershwin (1898–1937) Owes his place in the standard operatic repertoire to &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

=== 1900–present ===
* William Walton (1902–1983) Walton&#x27;s major opera is &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;.
* Michael Tippett (1905–1998) Probably the most famous British composer to follow in the wake of Benjamin Britten, Tippett wrote operas exploring metaphysical and social themes. They include &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot; and &quot;The Knot Garden&quot;.
* Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975) Shostakovich&#x27;s most famous opera, &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot;, a violent love story set in provincial Russia, scandalised Soviet authorities. He later produced a revised version, &quot;Katerina Ismailova&quot;. Nevertheless, the original became one of the most performed operatic works of the 20th century.
* Samuel Barber (1910–1981) American who composed two major operas, &quot;Vanessa&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.
* Gian Carlo Menotti (1911–2007) Italian American composer, particularly famous for the Christmas piece &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;, the first opera to be written specifically for television.
* Benjamin Britten (1913–1976) One of the handful of British opera composers to reach international acclaim, and one of the extremely few composers of 20th century operas that stayed in the standard repertory after their premieres. These operas include his masterworks &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;.
* Hans Werner Henze (1926–2012) One of the most widely performed post-World War II opera composers, Henze&#x27;s works include &quot;The Bassarids&quot; and &quot;Elegy for Young Lovers&quot;.
* Peter Maxwell Davies (1934–2016) A British modernist of the &quot;Manchester school&quot;, Davies wrote many stage works, including &quot;Taverner&quot; and &quot;The Martyrdom of St Magnus&quot;.
* Philip Glass (born 1937) A leading American composer of the minimalist school, Glass first came to fame with the opera &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, a collaboration with the theatre director Robert Wilson. Many stage works (including &quot;Akhnaten&quot; and &quot;The Voyage&quot;) followed.
* John Adams (born 1947) Like Glass, Adams started as a minimalist. His operas dealing with contemporary subjects, &quot;Nixon in China&quot; and &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot;, have gained critical acclaim and provoked political controversy.

== Female opera composers ==
A number of reasons, including the high cost of production and high status of opera, have been suggested to explain the relatively few women who have been composers of opera, and no woman composer met the criteria for inclusion above. However, some experts in our sample disagreed, and named either or both of the women below as comparable to those already listed:

* Francesca Caccini (18 September 1587 – after 1641) Italian composer, singer, lutenist, poet, and music teacher of the early Baroque era. She was also known by the nickname &quot;La Cecchina&quot;, given to her by the Florentines and probably a diminutive of &quot;Francesca&quot;. She was the daughter of Giulio Caccini. Her only surviving stage work, &quot;La liberazione di Ruggiero&quot;, is widely considered the oldest opera by a woman composer.
* Dame Ethel Smyth (1858–1944) Perhaps most famous for her work for the suffragettes; however, she also wrote several operas of note, including &quot;The Wreckers&quot;.
* Judith Weir (born 1954) Began composing full-length operas in 1987 with &quot;A Night at the Chinese Opera&quot;.

* Shafiga Akhundova (21 January 1924 – 26 July 2013) was a prominent Azerbaijani composer, the first professional female author of an opera in the East. She is also The People’s Artist of Azerbaijan.

* Svitlana Azarova (born 1976) Commissioned by the Royal Danish Opera to write &quot;Momo and the Time Thieves&quot;, which premiered in 2017.

Other notable women opera composers include Peggy Glanville-Hicks, Lori Laitman, Missy Mazzoli, Rachel Portman, and Olga Neuwirth.

<doc id="56375" wikidata="Q225976" url="?curid=56375" title="Aniara">
<text>Aniara () is a book-length epic science fiction poem written by Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson from 1953 to 1956. It narrates the tragedy of a large passenger spacecraft carrying a cargo of colonists escaping destruction on Earth veering off course, leaving the Solar System and entering into an existential struggle. The style is symbolic, sweeping and innovative for its time, with creative use of neologisms to suggest the science fictional setting. It was published in its final form on 13October 1956.

&quot;Aniara&quot; has been translated to around twenty languages. It was adapted into an opera in 1959 and a Swedish feature film in 2018.

Aniara, published in October 1956, was met with public interest and enthusiasm from literary critics and readers. The work was praised for its lyrical storytelling, profound thought, and its portrayal of human greatness turning into humiliation and powerlessness. Aniara has influenced other works of science fiction, such as &quot;Tau Zero&quot; (1970) by Poul Anderson and &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; (1992) by Vernor Vinge. The poem has become a landmark literary work and is often used as the basis for planetarium shows in Sweden. In 2019, the extrasolar planet HD 102956 b was named after Isagel, a character from the story, and its star was named Aniara.

==Title==
In a 1997 Swedish edition of &quot;Aniara,&quot; literary scholar Johan Wrede writes that the neologism “Aniara” is Harry Martinson&#x27;s own invention. Martinson came up with the word years before writing the work while reading astronomer Arthur Eddington, then giving it the meaning as the &quot;name for the space in which the atoms move&quot;. Others have submitted additional theories as to the origin of the word. A preface to a 2005 Italian edition claims that the title comes from ancient Greek ἀνιαρός, &quot;sad, despairing&quot;, plus special resonances that the sound &quot;a&quot; had for Martinson. Another theory of unclear origin makes up the word &quot;Aniara&quot; from the chemical symbols Ni (Nickel) and Ar (Argon) and the negative prefix &quot;a-&quot;, and interprets this as the ship being untethered to both earth (Nickel being abundant in the Earth&#x27;s core) and sky (Argon being abundant in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere). Martinson himself is said (by Tord Hall, longtime friend) to have been fond of this interpretation.

==Interpretation==
According to Ott and Broman, &quot;Aniara&quot; is an effort to &quot;[mediate] between science and poetry, between the wish to understand and the difficulty to comprehend&quot;. Martinson translates scientific imagery into the poem: for example, the &quot;curved space&quot; from Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity is likely an inspiration for Martinson&#x27;s description of the cosmos as &quot;a bowl of glass&quot;, according to the Nobel Prize Foundation. Martinson also said he was influenced by Paul Dirac.

==The poem ==
The poem consists of 103 cantos, each relating the tragedy of a large passenger spacecraft originally bound for Mars with a cargo of colonists from the ravaged Earth. After an accident, the ship is ejected from the Solar System and into an existential struggle.

The first 29 cantos of &quot;Aniara&quot; had previously been published in Martinson&#x27;s collection &quot;Cikada&quot; (1953), under the title &quot;Sången om Doris och Mima&quot; (&quot;The Song of Doris and Mima&quot;), relating the departure from Earth, the accidental near-collision with an asteroid (incidentally named Hondo, another name for the main Japanese isle where Hiroshima is situated) and ejection from the solar system, the first few years of increasing despair and distractions of the passengers, until news is received of the destruction of their home port, and perhaps of Earth itself. According to Martinson, he dictated the initial cycle as in a fever after a troubling dream, affected by the Cold War and the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution; in another recounting, he said the first 29 cantos were said to be inspired by his observation of the Andromeda Galaxy.

A major theme is that of art, symbolised by the semi-mystical machinery of the &quot;Mima&quot;, who relieves the ennui of crew and passengers with scenes of far-off times and places, and whose operator is also the sometimes naïve main narrator. The rooms of Mima, according to Martinson, represent different kinds of life styles or forms of consciousness. The accumulated destruction the Mima witnesses impels her to destroy herself in despair, to which she, the machine, is finally moved by the &quot;white tears of the granite&quot; melted by the &quot;phototurb&quot; which annihilates their home port, the great city of Dorisburg. Without the succour of the Mima, the erstwhile colonists seek distraction in sensual orgies, memories of their own and earlier lives, low comedy, religious cults, observations of strange astronomical phenomena, empty entertainments, science, routine tasks, brutal totalitarianism, and in all kinds of human endeavour, but ultimately cannot face the emptiness outside and inside.

The poems are metrical and mostly rhymed, using both traditional and individual forms, several alluding to a wide range of Swedish and Nordic poetry, such as the Finnish Kalevala.

== Translations ==
&quot;Aniara&quot; has been translated to around twenty languages including French, German, Italian, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Czech, Russian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, English, and Esperanto.

=== English translations ===
&quot;Aniara&quot; was translated into English as &quot;Aniara, A Review of Man in Time and Space&quot; by Hugh MacDiarmid and E. Harley Schubert in 1963. It was translated again into English by Stephen Klass and Leif Sjöberg for a 1999 edition. Neither edition is in print.

Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien, writing for the New York Review of Books, compares the two editions and finds the recent Klass Sjöberg edition more faithful to &quot;Martinson&#x27;s formal schemes&quot; while considering the MacDiarmid Schubert edition &quot;more persuasive&quot; as English poetry. Burns Singer wrote of the original translation &quot;it may well prove a seminal volume in the history of English letters&quot; in Times Literary Supplement.

== Reception ==
The publication of &quot;Aniara&quot; in October 1956 was met with much public interest and was enthusiastically received by many Swedish literary critics and readers. Reviewing it in Expressen in 1956, Bo Strömstedt wrote: &quot;it is a fabulous story, and Harry Martinson tells it with an ingenuity – in substance and in words – that is also quite fabulous; even though most of the songs are written in the same iambic verse, the book never becomes monotonous.&quot; &quot;Harry Martinson has not only written a breathtakingly lyrical science fiction story; he has also (...) created a gigantic &quot;Paradise lost&quot;, an epic about how human greatness is turned into humiliation and powerlessness&quot;.

The well-known American science fiction writer, Theodore Sturgeon, in reviewing a 1964 American edition for a genre audience, stated that &quot;Martinson&#x27;s achievement here is an inexpressible, immeasurable sadness. [It] [t]ranscends panic and terror and even despair [and] leaves you in the quiet immensities, with the feeling that you have spent time, and have been permanently tinted, by and with an impersonal larger-than-God force.&quot;

Writing a guest review for The New York Times, D. Bruce Lockerbie suggested that with &quot;Aniara&quot; Martinson had, along with C. S. Lewis, &quot;found that an interplanetary setting, light years removed from mundanity&quot; supplied &quot;the esthetic distance necessary for truly profound thought.&quot;

The poem has also been reviewed more recently. In a 2015 review, James Nicoll writes &quot;Martinson’s creative approach to astronomy and related matters gives the work an misleadingly archaic feel.&quot; M. A. Orthofer finds in 2018, the poem &quot;a product of its times, but even as aspects may no longer seem as current, it holds up well in its bleak vision.&quot; In his 2019 overview of Martinson&#x27;s works in the New York Review of Books, Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien concludes &quot;Aniara is an epic of extinction, conceived at a moment when extinction had begun to seem not only possible but perhaps imminent.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Aniara&quot; has had an influence on later works of science fiction, such as &quot;Tau Zero&quot; by Danish-American writer Poul Anderson.

In the 2004 centennial celebration of the birth of Harry Martinson, the Martinson Society characterized &quot;Aniara&quot; as an &quot;epic poem about the spaceship in which we flee the destruction of the earth, the spaceship that drifts off course into an endless universe&quot;, and considered the poem to have achieved becoming a legend in their own right, one of the myths people are familiar with without necessarily knowing who created them.

In December 2019, the extrasolar planet HD 102956 b was named after a character aboard the spacecraft, the pilot &quot;Isagel&quot;, as part of the IAU NameExoWorlds project. The exoplanet&#x27;s star was named &quot;Aniara&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
An opera by Karl-Birger Blomdahl also called &quot;Aniara&quot; premiered in 1959 with a libretto by Erik Lindegren based on Martinson&#x27;s poem; it was staged in Stockholm, Hamburg, Brussels and Darmstadt, and later in Gothenburg and Malmö. A performance by the Royal Swedish Opera at the Edinburgh International Festival was broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in Sept 1959.

Aniara (1960), a Swedish TV film directed by Arne Arnbom, written by Erik Lindegren and Harry Martinson, and starring Margareta Hallin, Elisabeth Söderström, Erik Sædén and Arne Tyrén. The music was composed by Karl-Birger Blomdahl.

The BBC Third Programme broadcast an English translation, read over five nights, in November 1962.

In Martinsons home country of Sweden, &quot;Aniara&quot; has commonly been used as the basis of planetarium shows, the first one set up in 1988 by Björn Stenholm using music by Dmitrij Shostakovich in the planetarium then housed in what is now the Old Observatory in Lund, Sweden. An English-language show premiered during the International Planetarium Society conference in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1992.

Tommy Körberg headlined &quot;31 songs from Aniara&quot;, a stage concert first set up in Olofström, Sweden in 1997.

The fourth album from the Swedish progressive metal band Seventh Wonder called &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (2010) is based on &quot;Aniara,&quot; the title track last 30:21 minutes and relates all the poem from beginning to end.

Swedish musician Kleerup released an album based on &quot;Aniara&quot; in 2012.

A melding of &quot;Aniara&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s opera &quot;Fidelio&quot; was staged by the Opéra de Lyon under the direction of American artist Gary Hill in 2013.

&quot;Aniara&quot;, a 2018 Swedish feature film by directors Pella Kågerman and Hugo Lilja, starring Emelie Jonsson, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival that year. Also in 2018, artist Fia Backstrom made the installation &quot; A Vaudeville on Mankind in Time and Space&quot;, using &quot;Aniara&quot; as its point of origin.

&quot;Aniara: Fragments of Time and Space&quot;, a choral theatre work with The Crossing, Helsinki’s Klockriketeatern, and composer Robert Maggio was performed in 2019.&quot;

<text>The Brothers Johnson were an American funk and R&amp;B band consisting of the American brothers George (&quot;Lightnin&#x27; Licks&quot;) and Louis E. Johnson (&quot;Thunder Thumbs&quot;). They achieved their greatest success from the mid-1970s to early 1980s, with three singles topping the R&amp;B charts (&quot;I&#x27;ll Be Good to You&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Letter 23&quot;, and &quot;Stomp!&quot;).

==Background==
===Formation===
Guitarist/vocalist George and bassist/vocalist Louis formed the band Johnson Three Plus One with older brother Tommy and their cousin Alex Weir while attending school in Los Angeles, California. When they became professionals, the band backed such touring R&amp;B acts as Bobby Womack and the Supremes. George and Louis Johnson later joined Billy Preston&#x27;s band and wrote selections for his albums &quot;Music Is My Life&quot; and &quot;The Kids &amp; Me&quot; before leaving his group in 1973. In 1976, the Brothers covered the Beatles&#x27; song, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, for the musical documentary &quot;All This and World War II&quot;.

Quincy Jones hired them to play on his LP &quot;Mellow Madness&quot;, and recorded four of their songs, including &quot;Is It Love That We&#x27;re Missin&#x27;?&quot; and &quot;Just a Taste of Me&quot;.

After touring with various artists including Bobby Womack and Billy Preston, they were hired by Quincy Jones for a tour in Japan and produced their debut album &quot;Look Out for #1&quot;, released in March 1976, which went to number 9 on the U.S. Billboard chart. Their &quot;Right on Time&quot; album was released in May 1977 and reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 200. &quot;Blam!!&quot; came out in August 1978 and reached number 7 on the Billboard 200.

Two of the band&#x27;s songs were featured on the soundtrack of the 1976 film &quot;Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed&quot; and one on the 1997 film &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. The instrumental track &quot;Thunder Thumbs and Lightnin&#x27; Licks&quot; refers to the brothers&#x27; nicknames. &quot;Get the Funk Out Ma Face&quot; was cowritten with Quincy Jones.

Their popular album &quot;Light Up the Night&quot; was released in March 1980 and rose to #5 on the Billboard 200. It was number 46 on the &quot;Top 100 LPs of 1980&quot; list in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The brothers self-produced the subsequent album, &quot;Winners&quot;; released in July 1981, it only reached #48 on the Billboard 200.

Among their most popular songs are &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Good to You&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 #3 in 1976) which prominently featured Syreeta Wright, &quot;Strawberry Letter 23&quot; (Hot 100 #5 in 1977, originally recorded by Shuggie Otis), &quot;Ain&#x27;t We Funkin&#x27; Now&quot; (1978), and &quot;Stomp!&quot; (Hot 100 #7 and Hot Dance Music/Club Play #1 in 1980). Their styles include funk, and R&amp;B ballads. Each album also included at least one instrumental cut that would either be considered light jazz (&quot;Tomorrow&quot;, 1976; &quot;Q&quot;, 1977; &quot;Streetwave&quot;, 1978; &quot;Smilin&#x27; On Ya&quot;, 1980; &quot;Tokyo&quot;, 1984) or funk (&quot;Thunder Thumbs &amp; Lightnin&#x27; Licks&quot;, 1976; &quot;Brother Man&quot;, 1977; &quot;Mista&#x27; Cool&quot;, 1978; &quot;Celebrations&quot;, 1980).

===1982 split===
The duo split up in 1982 to pursue separate projects.

===Louis&#x27; solo work===
Louis Johnson recorded a gospel music album in 1981 with his own group Passage, which included his then-wife Valerie Johnson and former Brothers Johnson percussionist/singer Richard Heath. He played bass on Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. In 1985 he recorded a single, &quot;Kinky&quot;, on Capitol Records; it appears on his &quot;Evolution&quot; album which was exclusively released in Europe that year. Louis then made 3 instructional videotapes for the Starlicks video-distribution company in which he shared his bass-playing skills. The first was released in 1985. He then settled down to enjoy family life with his wife and son, but by 1988 his then-manager Diane Taren talked him into going back into the recording studio. He started his bass academy during the 1990s and gave workshop clinics via his own Website. Louis Johnson died on May 21, 2015, age 60. His last performance was in 2013.

Tommy Johnson left the group and had a 29-year career with the Los Angeles Fire Department.

===George&#x27;s solo work===
George Johnson released one single in 1985, &quot;Back Against the Wall&quot;, on Quincy Jones&#x27; own Qwest label. A complete album (recorded but unreleased) came from that session, as George confirmed when he and Louis were interviewed around 1987/88 for &quot;Blues &amp; Soul Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom (see link below). George also delivered guitar work for Steve Arrington&#x27;s album &quot;Dancing in the Key of Life&quot; (1985) and had ad-libbed vocals on the track &quot;Think Back And Remember&quot; from the &quot;Galaxian&quot; album by the Jeff Lorber Fusion, released in 1981 on Arista Records.

===Various 1980s reunions and other projects===

In 1984 the brothers reunited in the recording studio. The resulting Leon Sylvers-produced LP, &quot;Out of Control&quot;, did not equal their past success, but it did garner them another R&amp;B hit with &quot;You Keep Me Coming Back&quot;. They teamed up again in 1988 to record &quot;Kickin&quot;&#x27;, the title track of which (&quot;Kick It to the Curb&quot;) was a collaboration with their then-neighbor Irene Cara. Although &quot;Kick It to the Curb&quot; became a minor hit, the album&#x27;s success was even more limited.

Between the two albums, both George and Louis released their aforementioned solo material and also appeared on &quot;Street Shadows&quot;, an album by keyboardist/arranger David Diggs, who had provided horn and string arrangements for &quot;Winners&quot;, &quot;Blast!&quot;, and Louis&#x27; &quot;Passage&quot;. &quot;Last Night&quot;, &quot;Street&quot;s opening track showcases George&#x27;s bass-guitar playing. He previously showed his bass skills on tracks like &quot;Teaser&quot; from &quot;Winners&quot; and &quot;The Great Awakening&quot; from &quot;Blast&quot;, the same way Louis shows his guitar skills on the duo&#x27;s various compositions.

Also during this time, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; (originally an instrumental on the B-side of &quot;Get the Funk Out Ma Face&quot;) was recorded with vocals by Tevin Campbell for Quincy Jones&#x27; &quot;Back on the Block&quot; release in 1989. This album also included Jones&#x27; hit remake of the Brothers Johnson&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Good to You&quot;, featuring Ray Charles and Chaka Khan.

Besides the brothers&#x27; brief appearance in Japan around 1994 and George guest-appearing at a Graham Central Station concert in Japan (including a released double-CD), the duo launched an expanded US tour in 2002 which got positive, wide exposure. It was visited by many fans and various artists in the entertainment business. Along with a website and discussion-forum, online visitors could share their experiences of the shows by wandering through the Land of Ladies and reliving Funkadelia&#x27;s heyday. A few years later, a combi-release of live-CD + DVD was released under the name &quot;Strawberry Letter 23: Live&quot;.

In 2006, Louis gave a duo-show with a drummer on the &quot;Poetry in Motion 1 Festival&quot; in Maryland. In late 2007 George performed with his own band at a Detroit festival, including a persona called Sir Nose. These days George performs with a special band, an initiative of Michael Henderson that includes Adina Howard, Cherrelle, Ray Parker Jr., and others.

Louis Johnson was found dead at his home in Las Vegas, May 21, 2015. The cause of death was gastrointestinal bleeding of the esophagus.

In 2022, the brothers&#x27; song &quot;Ain&#x27;t We Funkin&#x27; Now&quot; was sampled in singer Harry Styles&#x27; song &#x27;Daydreaming&quot; from his third album &quot;Harry&#x27;s House&quot;.

<doc id="56380" wikidata="Q543126" url="?curid=56380" title="Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra">
<text>The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra (Sanskrit: लङ्कावतारसूत्रम्, &quot;Discourse of the Descent into Laṅkā&quot;, , Chinese: 入楞伽經) is a prominent Mahayana Buddhist sūtra. It is also titled Laṅkāvatāraratnasūtram (&quot;The Jewel Sutra of the Entry into Laṅkā,&quot; Gunabhadra&#x27;s Chinese title: 楞伽阿跋多羅寶經 léngqié ābáduōluó bǎojīng) and Saddharmalaṅkāvatārasūtra (&quot;The Sutra on the Descent of the True Dharma into Laṅkā&quot;). A subtitle to the sutra found in some sources is &quot;the heart of the words of all the Buddhas&quot; (一切佛語心 yiqiefo yuxin, Sanskrit: &quot;sarvabuddhapravacanahṛdaya&quot;). 

The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; recounts a teaching primarily between Gautama Buddha and a bodhisattva named Mahāmati (&quot;Great Wisdom&quot;). The sūtra is set in mythical Laṅkā, ruled by Rāvaṇa, the king of the rākṣasas. The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; discusses numerous Mahayana topics, such as Yogācāra philosophy of mind-only (&quot;cittamātra&quot;) and the three natures, the &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot; (store-house consciousness), the inner &quot;disposition&quot; (&quot;gotra&quot;), the buddha-nature, the luminous mind (&quot;prabhāsvaracitta&quot;), emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;) and vegetarianism. 

The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; was often quoted and paraphrased by Indian philosophers like Chandrakirti and Shantideva, and it also figured prominently in the development of East Asian Buddhism. It is notably an important sūtra in Zen Buddhism, as it discusses the key issue of &quot;sudden enlightenment&quot;. The text survives in one Sanskrit manuscript from Nepal as well as in Tibetan and Han Chinese translation. 

==Overview and main themes==
Various scholars like DT Suzuki and Takasaki Jikido have noted that the text is somewhat unsystematic and disorganized, resembling the notebook or commonplace book of a Mahayana master which recorded important teachings. According to Takasaki Jikido, the Lanka &quot;is, as often said, merely a mosaic collection of small parts put at random within the frame of a sutra.&quot; 

The present Sanskrit edition contains ten chapters and most scholars consider the introductory chapter (the &quot;Ravana&quot; chapter), the ninth chapter (a dharani) and the last chapter (the &quot;Sagathakam&quot; verses) as being later additions. Furthermore, not all versions of the sutra contain these chapters (1, 9, 10). However, some verses found in the &quot;Sagathakam&quot; are also duplicates and are found within the main body of the sutra. Takasaki Jikido has argued that these verse portions might actually be the earliest core of the sutra, around which prose explanations grew. 

The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; draws on and explains numerous important Mahayana Buddhist concepts including the philosophy of Yogācāra school, the doctrine of emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;), and the doctrines of buddha-nature (&quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;), and the luminous mind (&quot;prabhāsvaracitta&quot;). In the introduction to the sutra (the &quot;nidana&quot;), the sutra outlines some key teachings which will be expounded on, &quot;the Five Dharmas and the Three Inherent Natures (pañcadharmasvabhāva), the Eight Consciousnesses (vijñāna) and the Two forms of Selflessness (nairātmyādvaya).&quot; Indeed, the sutra later states that within this set of teachings is included &quot;all of the Mahayana&quot;. 

According to Nguyen Dac Sy, the most important doctrines of the Laṅkāvatāra are the primacy of consciousness (Skt. &quot;vijñānavada&quot;), the teaching that consciousness as the only reality and that &quot;all the objects of the world, and the names and forms of experience, are manifestations of the mind&quot; as well as the &quot;identification of the Buddha-nature (in the state of &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;) with &quot;alayavijñāna&quot;.&quot;

Other topics discussed in the sutra include Buddhist vegetarianism, the theory of icchantikas, the wrong views of non-buddhists (tirthikas, especially Samkhya), a critique of the sravakayana, the limited nature of language in describing the ultimate truth, the One Vehicle, the bodhisattva path, and the three bodies of the Buddha (trikaya) doctrine. 

=== Svacittamātra ===

The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; often presents a mind-only philosophy influenced by the idealistic thought of the Yogacara school. According to the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; &quot;all things are only manifestations of the mind itself&quot; i.e. all phenomena are &quot;mind-only&quot; (&quot;cittamātra&quot;) or &quot;ideation-only&quot; (&quot;vijñaptimatra&quot;). This idealistic view is explained by the &quot;Lanka&quot; as the view that &quot;what is seen as something external is nothing but one&#x27;s own mind&quot; (&quot;svacitta-drsya-mātram&quot;).&quot; According to Gishin Tokiwa, this is not to say that there are no independent external beings conventionally, but rather what it means is that true insight into the nature of reality goes beyond all concepts of internal and external. Gishin Tokiwa sees the theory of &quot;svacittamātra&quot; as the central message of the sutra. 

The sutra often presents Yogacara theories of consciousness, like the eight consciousnesses and the three natures, as well as the &quot;five dharmas&quot;. Furthermore, since, as the sutra states, the whole world &quot;is nothing but a complex manifestation of one&#x27;s mental activities,&quot; all phenomena are empty of self (&quot;anatman&quot;) and illusory (&quot;maya&quot;) - &quot;to be regarded as forms seen in a vision and a dream, empty of substance, unborn and without self-nature.&quot;

Tokiwa further writes that the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra,&quot; being closely influenced by Prajñaparamita thought, also tempers this idealistic mind-only view with the idea that ultimate reality transcends being and non-being (bhāvābhāva), and is beyond all views and concepts, even that of &quot;mind&quot; (citta) itself. Thus, even though the Lanka presents a &quot;mind-only&quot; view in some passages, other sections state that the ultimate truth or Suchness transcends even mind, thought, discrimination and subjectivity itself. Furthermore, the reason why all things are beyond being and non-being is closely connected to the idea that all experiences are mind only. It is because all experiences are just reflections of the mind of those deluded beings which experience them that we can say that phenomena have no single characteristic or way of existing. All things are experienced (or not experienced) in various ways (vaicitryam) by different types of living beings, but none of these experiences are fixed or ultimately true, each one is mistaken (bhranti) in some way. At the same time, we can say that this ultimate nature of the emptiness of all characteristics is something that does not change. This ultimate reality, the dharmakaya, is also free from arising, abiding and cessation while also being the ground for the illusory manifestation of the world. 

In spite of this however, the view of &quot;mind-only&quot; is still seen as an important way to transcend our current deluded state, as the Lanka sutra states:Through attaining the reality as nothing but our own mind, which is the Self free from manifestation, we return to abiding in the final attainment of prajña. In turn, the view that the world and phenomena exist &quot;externally&quot;, outside of mind, is seen as a serious error that leads to delusion and suffering. The Lanka sutra specifically cites the dualistic view of Samkhya philosophy for criticism.

=== The Five Dharmas ===
According to Saganuma, the schema of the Five Dharmas (pañcadharma), which explains all of reality in terms of five phenomena, is essential for understanding the basic worldview of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot;. Indeed, according to Saganuma, the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; considers that all Mahayana teachings are included within these five dharmas. 

The Five Dharmas are the following: 

* Nimitta (images, appearances), this is what has characteristics like form (rupa), shape, distinctive features, and images (ākāra).
* Nāma (naming), these are the ideas (saṃjñā) based on the appearances
* Samkalpa, Vikalpa (discrimination), the distinctions and connections between different names and ideas that allow us to distinguish between them
* Samyagjñāna (right knowledge), the knowledge gained by bodhisattvas who understand the true nature of things (i.e. Suchness) and who transcend the discriminations of worldly people
* Tathatā (Suchness), the truth, ultimate reality, which is beyond all words, images and discrimination, beyond all duality and plurality. 

The &quot;Lanka&quot; also closely connects this theory with the Yogacara theory of the three inherent natures. According to the &quot;Lanka,&quot; image, naming and discrimination correspond to the parikalpita-svabhāva (the &quot;fully conceptualized&quot; nature) and the paratantra-svabhāva (dependent nature), while right knowledge and Suchness correspond to the pariniṣpanna-svabhāva (the fully accomplished nature).

=== The buddha-nature and emptiness ===
A major topic found in the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; are the teachings on &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; (buddha-nature) also called &quot;buddhagotra&quot; (buddha disposition or buddha lineage) or &quot;tathagatagotra&quot;, which is explained in many different ways throughout the sutra. The &quot;Lanka&quot; describes buddha-nature as &quot;the purity of natural luminosity, it is primordially pure, endowed with the thirty-two major marks, and hidden within the bodies of all sentient beings...just like a gem of great value wrapped in a stained cloth, it is wrapped up in the cloth of the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas, is tainted by the stains of desire, hatred, ignorance, and false imagination but is permanent, eternal, peaceful, and everlasting&quot;. 

Buddha-nature is also equated with the wisdom of noble beings, &quot;the attainment of the realization of suchness&quot; (tathata) and the perfected nature (&quot;pariniṣpanna&quot;). Furthermore, the &quot;Lanka&quot; explains buddha-nature in a positive manner as the naturally luminous mind (&quot;prabhāsvaracitta&quot;) and also equates it with the &quot;true self&quot; which is realized by &quot;those whose minds are not distracted by emptiness.&quot; 

However, the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; also states that buddha-nature is not a self (atman), calls it selfless (nairātmya), and states that it is empty of self-nature. The Lanka further states that buddha-nature is merely a skillful means (upaya) of teaching the dharma to non-buddhists (tīrthikas) who cling to a self: 

Mahāmati, my instruction on the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is not similar to the doctrine of the self of the tīrthikas. Rather, Mahāmati, the tathāgatas give the instruction on the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; as bearing the meaning of words such as emptiness, true end, nirvāṇa, nonarising, signlessness, and wishlessness. Thus, for the sake of relinquishing what makes naive beings afraid of the lack of a self, the tathāgata arhats, the completely perfect buddhas, teach the sphere of nonconceptuality and nonappearance through the introductory instruction on the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;...Mahāmati, the tathāgatas teach the instruction on the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; through teaching the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; in order to attract the tīrthikas, who cling to the doctrine of the self. So how may those whose thinking falls into the views of conceiving an incorrect self and those who succumb to falling into the sphere of three [kinds of] liberation swiftly awaken to unsurpassable and completely perfect awakening? Mahāmati, it is for their sake that the tathāgata arhats, the completely perfect buddhas, give the instruction on the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;. Therefore, this is not similar to the doctrine of a self of the tīrthikas. Consequently, in order to put an end to the views of the tīrthikas, they need to become followers of the heart of nonself of a tathāgata (tathāgatanairātmyagarbha). According to Brunnholzl, the &quot;Lanka&quot; further states that what &quot;all sūtras of all buddhas teach is nothing but emptiness, nonarising, nonduality, and the lack of nature&quot;. The sutra also states that &quot;all characteristics of conceptions have terminated, either through the instruction on the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; or through the instruction on identitylessness&quot;. Karl Brunnholzl notes that throughout various passages, the &quot;Lanka&quot; attempts to unify the positive buddha-nature teachings and the more negative emptiness teachings, presenting them as being equivalent to each other and as non-contradictory.

=== The storehouse consciousness and buddha-nature ===
In other passages, the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; (&quot;buddha-womb&quot; or buddha-source) is also equated with the &quot;storehouse consciousness&quot; (Skt. &quot;ālayavijñāna&quot;), the most fundamental layer of consciousness which contains the karmic seeds of defilement. However, in other further passages, the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is also said to be free from all eight consciousnesses and &quot;free from the characteristics of mind, without consciousness and mentation.&quot; 

As noted by Brunnholzl, this paradoxical storehouse consciousness qua buddha-nature contains both contaminated and uncontaminated latent tendencies (&quot;anusaya&quot;). Further, it is both momentary and not momentary, it is the cause of virtue and non-virtue, it is the cause of all existences in saṃsāra, and thus it must be purified. But, at the same time, this same buddha-nature is described as indestructible, free from a self, naturally pure and free from the flaw of impermanence. It is compared to a dancer who does various performances and yet also to pure gold or a diamond that is never tarnished or changed. The Lanka sutra states that this buddha-nature storehouse-consciousness is something that cannot be fully understood by those who are not Buddhas. 

The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; explains this paradoxical buddha-nature consciousness which is defiled and yet undefiled as follows:Mahāmati, the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; contains the causes of virtue and non-virtue and is the creator of all births and forms of existence. Free from a self and what is mine, like a dancer, it enters [all kinds of] dangerous forms of existence...Being impregnated by all kinds of beginningless latent tendencies of the impregnations of negative tendencies of discursiveness, it is called &quot;ālaya-consciousness.&quot; Its body, together with the seven consciousnesses that arise from the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance, always operates uninterruptedly, just like a great ocean and its waves, is free from the flaw of impermanence, is the cessation of the position of a self, and is utterly pure by nature. The seven consciousnesses such as mentation and the mental consciousness, which are other than this and arise and perish, are momentary, arise from the cause that is false imagination, focus on collections of shapes, activities, and distinct instances, cling to names and characteristics, do not understand that appearing forms and characteristics are one’s own mind, do not discriminate happiness and suffering, are not the cause for liberation, arise through and give rise to names, characteristics, and rising desire, and have the [ālaya-consciousness] as their cause and support...However, if the ālaya-consciousness, which is known as &quot;the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;,&quot; does not undergo a change (parāvṛtti), there is no cessation of the seven active consciousnesses. For what reason? Because the consciousnesses flourish by virtue of [the ālaya-consciousness’s serving as] their cause and support, and [because the ālaya-consciousness] is not an object of any of the yogins [who are immersed] in the yogas of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and tīrthikas. Even when one realizes one’s own lack of a personal self and apprehends the specific and general characteristics of the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas, this &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; still flourishes. It terminates only through seeing the five dharmas, the three natures, and phenomenal identitylessness...Therefore, Mahāmati, bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have this special goal should purify the tathāgata heart, which is known as &quot;the ālaya-consciousness.&quot; Thus, the fundamental mind (citta) or storehouse consciousness is seen by the &quot;Lanka&quot; as neither separate from nor united with the defiled latent tendencies. Like a white piece of clothing that remains white underneath but can be dirtied by dust.&quot;

=== The mistaken mind and the pure consciousness ===

In some passages, the sutra also seems to divide the storehouse consciousness into two. In one passage these are called &quot;the ultimate ālaya-consciousness and the ālaya of cognizance (vijñapti),&quot; while in another passage, they are called &quot;the true nature of the mind&quot; (which is pure) and &quot;the mind that arises from mistakenness.&quot; D.T. Suzuki similarly notes that according to the &quot;Laṅkā,&quot; the storehouse consciousness has two aspects &quot;the Ālaya as it is in itself&quot;, called pāramālaya-vijñāna (the &#x27;incessant&#x27; or prabandha aspect), and &quot;the Ālaya as mental representation&quot; (vijñaptir ālaya, the manifested or lakshaṇa aspect). Thus, it is the fluctuating (&quot;pravṛitti&quot;) aspect of the storehouse consciousness that gets caught up in the discrimination and craving of the manas consciousness, while the primitively pure (&quot;prakṛitipuriśuddhi&quot;) aspect of the storehouse does not. 

Indeed, this pure aspect of the storehouse consciousness is also called &quot;something that has been in existence since the very first&quot; (&quot;pūrvadharmasthititā,&quot; or &quot;paurāṇasthitidharmatā&quot;). According to Suzuki, the most common terms for this ultimate reality include: Tathatā (&quot;suchness&quot; or &quot;thusness&quot;), as well as &quot;Satyatā, &quot;the state of being true&quot;, Bhūtatā, &quot;the state of being real&quot;, Dharmadhātu, &quot;realm of truth&quot;, Nirvana, the Permanent (&quot;nitya&quot;), Sameness (&quot;samatā&quot;), the One (&quot;advaya&quot;), Cessation (&quot;nirodha&quot;), the Formless (&quot;animitta&quot;), Emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;), etc.&quot; 

In yet another passage, the &quot;Lanka&quot; speaks of nine forms of consciousnesses (as opposed to the classic eight consciousnesses of Yogacara). This passage may have been the source of Paramārtha’s doctrine of the ninth consciousness, which he termed the *&quot;amalavijñāna&quot; (pure consciousness). This distinction between an ultimate and a relative storehouse consciousness suggests that buddha-nature is not to be understood as completely equivalent with the storehouse consciousness, but rather is to be seen as the pure nature of the mind that remains once the mind has been purified of all adventitious stains (āgantukamala). 

=== Error, wisdom and awakening ===
According to the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; suffering and ignorance arises when consciousness engages in discrimination, representation and conceptualization. This error leads to the egoic consciousness, the &quot;manas&quot;, which considers phenomena as being real and permanent and thus to craving and attachment. The key error of the mind is to consider any phenomena as being something other than mind. 

Meanwhile, liberation and awakening (bodhi) arises when discrimination is brought to an end by a deep intuitive and non-conceptual knowledge (jñana) of suchness (tathata). Awakening is the result of the bringing to an end of various activities of consciousness, such as the discrimination of the egoic consciousness (manas) and the latent tendencies of the storehouse consciousness&quot;.&quot; As Gishin Tokiwa writes, awakening is attained when the discriminating storehouse consciousness &quot;ceases to be the ground and object of the seven vijñanas (consciousnesses)&quot; and when only the pure buddha-nature remains. 

This radical reversal of the activities of consciousness is called the turning around of the basis (&quot;āśraya-parāvṛtti&quot;)&quot;.&quot; To reach this radical transformation of the mind, the bodhisattva must purify his actions and thoughts (through Buddhist practices like ethical discipline and meditation) as well as develop insight into the nature of things (through hearing the teachings and meditating on emptiness)&quot;.&quot; 

The knowledge which knows the ultimate truth is a central topic of the Lanka and is variously termed pratyātmāryajñānagati (the state of noble knowledge realized by oneself), svapratyātma (inner self-realization), pratyātmagati (that which is realized by oneself), pratyātmagatigocara (the field realized by oneself) and pratyātma dharmatā (the Dharma nature realized by oneself) in the sutra. Akira Suganuma writes that this &quot;inner wisdom&quot; is &quot;that which all the teachings in the &quot;Laṅkāvatārasūtra&quot; indicate to us is to realize or accomplish.&quot; 

According to D.T. Suzuki, this transcendental wisdom (aryajñāna) of the Lanka is &quot;an intuitive understanding which, penetrating through the surface of existence, sees into that which is the reason of everything logically and ontologically&quot; as well as &quot;a fundamental intuition into the truth of Mind-only and constitutes the Buddhist enlightenment.&quot; Suzuki notes that aryajñāna is also designated by other terms, such as &quot;pravicayabuddhi&quot; (&quot;an insight fixed upon the ultimate ground of existence&quot;), &quot;svabuddhi&quot; (innate understanding), &quot;nirābhāsa&quot; or &quot;anābhāsa&quot; (imagelessness), &quot;nirvikalpa&quot; (beyond discrimination / concepts). The noble wisdom stands in contrast to &quot;vikalpabuddhi&quot;, discriminative understanding, a relative and conceptual kind of knowledge based on duality and pluralities.

=== Sudden and gradual purification ===
An important passage in the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; discusses how the purification of the mind occurs, and the passage states that it can occur gradually as well as suddenly. In this passage, the &quot;Lanka&quot; states that the purification of the mind can happen &quot;by degrees and not all at once. Like the gooseberry, which ripens by degrees,&quot; and immediately after it also states that awakening can also happen &quot;all at once&quot;: Or just as a clear mirror reflects formless images all at once, tathagatas likewise purify the stream of perceptions of beings’ minds by displaying pure, formless, undifferentiated realms all at once. Or just as the sun and moon illuminate images all at once, tathagatas likewise reveal the supreme realm of inconceivable wisdom all at once to those who have freed themselves of the habit-energy and misconceptions that are perceptions of their own minds. Or just as repository consciousness distinguishes such different perceptions of one’s mind as the realms of the body, its possessions, and the world around it all at once, nishyanda buddhas likewise bring beings to maturity in whatever realm they dwell all at once and lead practitioners to reside in Akanishtha Heaven. This idea was important for the establishment of the East Asian Buddhist doctrine of sudden (dun 頓) enlightenment, an important doctrine which was later widely debated and discussed in Zen Buddhism.

=== The Ultimate is beyond words ===
Another important idea found in the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; is how the ultimate reality (dharmata) transcends all language and conventional expressions and is free from verbal discrimination (&quot;vāgvikalpa&quot;). Because ultimate reality is eternal, free from arising and ceasing, and cannot be grasped or cognized (&quot;anupalabdhi&quot;) the sutra states that Buddhas &quot;do not teach the doctrine that is dependent letters (&quot;akṣarapatita&quot;).&quot;

Because of this, all teachings in the sutra are not the ultimate, even though they point to the ultimate, like a finger pointing at the Moon. Thus, one should not become attached to the words of the sutra, to the letters (which are only provisional, &quot;saṁvṛti&quot;) and instead should focus on the ultimate meaning (&quot;paramārtha&quot;). The Lanka thus states:As the ignorant grasps the finger-tip (that points to the moon) and does not cognize the moon, so those who cling to the letter do not know my truth. The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; also states that even though Buddhas teach (in conventional fashion), they have never uttered even a single letter or syllable (&quot;akṣara)&quot;:the Tathagatas neither uttered nor answered even a letter (&quot;ekam apy akṣaram&quot;), because truths are beyond the letters. It does not mean, however, that (the Tathagatas) never declare what is connected with the benefit (artha) of beings. Depending upon discrimination, they declare anything. If, Mahamati, they do not depend upon discrimination, the scriptures containing all the truths will disappear, and when the scriptures disappear there will be no Buddhas, Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas and Bodhisattvas; when they disappear, what is to be taught and to whom? For this reason, Mahamati, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva should not cling to the words or letters in a canonical text...the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva should be in conformity with the meaning (&quot;artha-pratiśaraṇa&quot;) and not with the letter (&quot;vyañjana&quot;). According to Charles Willemen, this teaching of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra&quot; is &quot;the basis for Chan’s famous wordless teaching&quot; which sees Chan as being taught &quot;without words&quot; (言说).

== History and editions ==
According to Asanga Tilakaratne, &quot;it is generally believed that the sutra was compiled during 350-400 CE,&quot; although &quot;many who have studied the sutra are of opinion that the introductory chapter and the last two chapters were added to the book at a later period.&quot; Christian Lindtner argues that some early recension of the &quot;Lankavatara&quot; influenced the writings of Nagarjuna and Aryadeva (3rd century), basing his conclusion on several close or literal allusions to the sutra in early madhyamaka texts. Thus, the core of the sutra could date to a much earlier time. The &quot;Lanka&quot; is quoted four times in the &quot;Sūtrasamuccaya&quot; which has been attributed to Nāgārjuna (but this attribution has also been questioned by some scholars). Lambert Schmithausen has argued that the evidence attributing this text to Nagarjuna is insufficient and that furthermore, a passage from the &quot;Lankavatara&quot; seems to be a direct quotation from Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Trimsika&quot; (4th to 5th century CE). But the issue of the dating of the Lanka is further complicated by the complex nature of Vasubandhu&#x27;s authorship of various texts and the fact that his &quot;Vyākhyāyukti&quot; also quotes the &quot;Lankavatara&quot;. 

Some modern scholars like Gishin Tokiwa also surmise that the sutra may have been compiled in Sri Lanka between 411 and 435, during a time when Mahayana Buddhism was popular in the island (at sites like Abhayagiri vihara) and the island also received visits from Chinese pilgrims like Faxian. 

Four translations of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; were made from Sanskrit into the Chinese language between roughly 420 CE and 704, the earliest being attributed to Dharmarakṣa in the 5th century. 

Of these, only three are now extant: 

* The first is Taishō Tripiṭaka 670 (楞伽阿跋多羅寶經 &quot;Lengqieabaduoluobaojing&quot;). This is the earliest edition which was translated by Guṇabhadra in 443 CE, and divided into four fascicles. This edition by Guṇabhadra is said to be the one handed down from the founder of Chan Buddhism, Bodhidharma, to the Second Patriarch, Dazu Huike. This version lacks chapter 1, 9 and 10 from the later versions.
* The second is Taishō # 671 (入楞伽經 &quot;Rulengqiejing&quot;). This second edition was translated by Bodhiruci in 513 CE, and divided into ten fascicles. This edition is criticized in the imperial preface to the later translation, which says that it contains extra words and sentences mixed in that detract from the original meaning.
* The third is Taishō # 672 (&quot;The Mahāyāna Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra;&quot; 大乘入楞伽經 &quot;Dashengrulengqiejing&quot;). This third edition (divided into seven fascicles) was translated by a team headed by Śikṣānanda and it was completed in 704 CE. This final translation was made at the behest of Empress Wu Zetian, after Śikṣānanda had completed his 80-fascicle translation of the &quot;&quot;. This translation is said to have employed five separate Sanskrit editions for accuracy. The Huayan scholar and Sanskritist Fazang was also involved in this translation effort. Before the final edits to this version had been made, Śikṣānanda returned to India, and another Indian monk called Mitrasena came to China who had studied the Buddhist sutras for 25 years in India, and who knew the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;. Fazang and Mitrasena were given the task of revising and completing the translation.

In addition to these Chinese translations, there are also two Tibetan translations, and a version of the Sanskrit was preserved in Nepal. One Tibetan translation is derived from the Sanskrit original, and the other is likely a translation of Guṇabhadra&#x27;s Chinese into Tibetan. 

Nanjo Bunyu prepared a critical edition of the Sanskrit in 1923 based on four manuscripts from the Nepalese recension, among other sources. 

According to Gishin Tokiwa, the Sanskrit edition and Sikṣānanda&#x27;s translation contain various additions and errors. Tokiwa considers that &quot;the Gunabhadra version conveys the earliest, original Sanskrit text-form whereas the two other Chinese versions as well as the extant Sanskrit manuscripts that include the Nanjio-edition did not go through any kind of appropriate text-critique.&quot; Takasaki Jikido likewise argued that the Gunabhadra edition was the closest version available to the early Sanskrit edition. 

Gishin Tokiwa has also published a reconstructed Sanskrit edition based on the extant Sanskrit manuscript and the Gunabhadra translation. 

The earliest translations of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; are significantly shorter than later ones, which D.T. Suzuki interprets as suggesting that additions were made to the text over time. The first and last chapters (which connect the text with Ravana, the villain of the Ramayana, and adds a dharani) are missing from the earliest translation, and the prose of the first chapter in later translations does not agree with the verse-form provided alongside it. Suzuki also suggests that the chapter on meat eating, where the Theravada &#x27;thrice clean&#x27; practice is criticized, may be a later edition based on its different tone and content from the rest of the text. Based on the text&#x27;s lack of organization, varying and sometimes irrelevant chapter headings, and expansion over time, Suzuki suggests that it may have originated as a collection of individual passages summarizing essential Mahayana doctrines, which were later shaped into a narrative.

== Analysis and commentaries ==
According to Takasaki Jikido, because of this mosaic like character of the text, the best way to analyze the scripture has been &quot;to divide the whole text into small parts or sections according to their subjects.&quot; The first commentator to attempt this was the Japanese author Kokan Shiren, who in the 14th century divided the text into 86 sections with titles. Most of these sections (but not all) include a prose part followed by a verse section that recapitulates the prose teaching. 

Chandrakirti argued that the text needed to be interpreted, and that it was &quot;not to be understood as a negation of form.&quot;

=== Indian commentaries ===
There are two traditional Indian commentaries preserved in Tibetan translations: 

* Jñānaśrībhadra (11th century), ʼPhags pa lang kar gshegs paʼi ʼgrel pa (*Āryalaṅkāvatāravṛtti) P #5519; D #4018
* Jñānavajra (12th century), ʼPhags pa lang kar gshegs pa zhes bya ba theg pa chen poʼi mdoʼi ʼgrel pa de bzhin gshegs paʼi snying poʼi rgyan zhes bya ba (*Āryalaṅkāvatāranāmamahāyānasūtravṛtti Tathāgatahṛdayālaṃkāra nāma)
These commentaries mainly comment on the sutra by relying on the epistemological tradition of Dharmakīrti. Jñānavajra&#x27;s commentary presents a unique Yogācāra-Svātantrika-Madhyamaka perspective which was termed ‘cognitive centrism’ (&quot;vijñaptimadhyama, rnam rig dbu ma&quot;) and he also heavily relies on the works of Kamalaśīla, particularly the &quot;Madhyamakāloka&quot;. In this commentary, he also critiques the alīkākāravada view of Yogacara philosophy&quot;.&quot; According to H. Hadano, Jñānavajra&#x27;s commentary &quot;takes the standpoint that the myriad pure and defiled dharmas are all manifestations of mind (citta), that they are not different to mind, and that they are mind-itself, in other words, the standpoint of the Rnam par rig pa tsam gyi dbu ma (vijñapti-mātrika-mādhyamika) which considers saṃvṛtti and paramārtha as two sides of the same coin, and discards duality.&quot; 

=== East Asian commentaries ===
There are also numerous East Asian Buddhist commentaries on the Lanka, like the commentaries by Huayan Patriarchs Zhiyan and Fazang. According to John Jorgensen, Fazang&#x27;s commentary explains ten key themes he finds in the sutra: &quot;1. the emptiness and existence in causation; 2.the fundamental and derived in the vijñānas; 3. the true and false in the substance of the vijñānas; 4. the seeds of the fundamental vijñāna; 5. the universality of the Buddha-nature; 6. the turning around of the minds of the two vehicle (followers); 7. the opening and closing of the stages of practice; 8. the non-obstruction of barrier and cure; 9. the freedom of pro and contrary; and 10. the eternal persistence of the Buddha-result.&quot; Fazang considered the Lankāvatāra to be one of the definitive sutras which taught the theme (zong) of &quot;the attribute of reality&quot; which teaches that consciousness is produced by buddha-nature. 

The Lanka is also quoted and commented on in the &quot;Bodhidharma Anthology&quot; (i.e. the &quot;Putidamo sixing lun&quot;), an important text of early Chan Buddhism that contains material attributed to Bodhidharma and his students. Jorgensen also states that &quot;there is evidence that commentaries on the Lankāvatāra Sūtra attributed to Bodhidharma reached Japan, some at least by 736.&quot; This &quot;Bodhidharma commentary...has to date from between 445 and 740&quot; and &quot;shares much in common with the theories of Jingying Huiyuan (523-592) of the Southern Dilun Faction, who quoted the Lankāvatāra Sūtra as one of his authorities.&quot; 

Various commentaries were written during the Song dynasty. Baochen, writing in the Northern Song dynasty era, also wrote a long commentary to the Lanka which was influenced by the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; and Huayan. Another commentary is that of the Chan monk Zhengshou (1146-1208) of the Xuedou lineage which provides a Chan perspective on the Lanka. The Tiantai monk Shanyue (1149-1241), also wrote a commentary to the Lanka. 

One of the most important Japanese commentaries is Kokan Shiren’s (1278-1346) &quot;Treatise on the Essence of the Buddha’s Words&quot; (&quot;Butsugoshinron&quot; 佛語心論), in 18 scrolls 巻, which was written in 1324. He ignores most Song dynasty commentaries, and only cites Zhiyan&#x27;s early commentary. Kokan&#x27;s commentary includes extensive polemics against Tendai Buddhism and Zhanran&#x27;s views on the &quot;Lankavatara&quot;. Kokan attempts to show that Zen is a superior and separate transmission of the Buddha’s realization which stands entirely apart from all other Buddhist teaching, doctrine and scriptures and abandons all relative discourse, all &quot;words and letters.&quot; Kokan draws on the teachings of the &quot;Lankavatara&quot; on the perfect nature taught by the Dharmakaya to claim that Zen is a unique transmission of the realization of this perfect nature and that this is what Bodhidharma&#x27;s transmission of “seeing the nature and completing Buddhahood” means. Another Japanese commentary was published in 1687 by Tokugan Yoson. 

During the Ming dynasty, various commentaries were written, such as those by the Chan-Pure Land master Ouyi Zhixu (including 楞伽阿跋多羅寶經義疏, &quot;Commentary on the Meanings of the Laṅkāvatāra Jewel Sūtra&quot;), the Huayan master Tongrun&#x27;s &quot;Lengqie jing hezhe&quot; (楞伽經合轍) and Jiaohong&#x27;s (焦竑 1540–1620) &quot;Lengqie jing jing jie ping lin&quot; (楞伽經精解評林, &quot;Forest of Comments of Detailed Interpretations on Lankavatara Sutra&quot;).

<text>Barry Eugene White (né Carter; September 12, 1944 – July 4, 2003) was an American singer and songwriter. A two-time Grammy Award winner known for his bass voice and romantic image, his greatest success came in the 1970s as a solo singer and with the Love Unlimited Orchestra, crafting many enduring R&amp;B, soul, funk, and disco songs such as his two biggest hits: &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the First, the Last, My Everything&quot;.

White recorded 20 studio albums during the course of his career, but multiple versions and compilations were released worldwide that were certified gold, 41 of which also attained platinum status. White had 20 gold and 10 platinum singles, with worldwide record sales in excess of 100 million records, and is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. His influences included James Cleveland, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, the Supremes, the Four Tops, and Marvin Gaye.

==Early life==
White was born Barry Eugene Carter on September 12, 1944, in Galveston, Texas. His father was Melvin A. White, and his mother was Sadie Marie Carter. Unbeknownst to his mother, his father was already married to another woman, so she gave him her last name. However, upon seeing her last name of Carter on his son&#x27;s birth certificate, Melvin scratched Carter out and wrote his own last name of White. He grew up in the Watts neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles, California. He was the older of two children; his brother Darryl was 13 months younger. White grew up listening to his mother&#x27;s classical music collection and first took to the piano, emulating what he heard on the records.

White has often been credited with playing piano, at age 11, on Jesse Belvin&#x27;s 1956 hit single, &quot;Goodnight My Love&quot;. However, in a 1995 interview with the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, White denied writing or arranging the song. He believed the story was an exaggeration by journalists. While White and Belvin lived in the same neighborhood, Belvin was 12 years older than White.

White attended Jacob A. Riis High School, an all-boys academy in southeast Los Angeles. White&#x27;s voice deepened suddenly when he was 13 or 14. He recalled: &quot;[As a child], I had a normal squeaky kid voice. Then as a teenager, that completely changed. My mother cried because she knew her baby boy had become a man.&quot; In a 2000 interview with Conan O&#x27;Brien, he further recalled: &quot;I woke up one morning when I was 14. I spoke to my mother, and I scared both of us.&quot; White also told the BBC that this happened when he was 13.

White was jailed for four months at the age of 16 for stealing $30,000 worth of Cadillac tires (equivalent to about $ now). While in jail, he listened to Elvis Presley singing &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never&quot; on the radio, an experience he later credited with changing the course of his life. White had another moment of inspiration on his 18th birthday, which also was the first day back for his graduating year of high school. He skipped class to walk to Capitol Records headquarters in Hollywood and stood across the street from the office staring for hours. Seeing the liveliness of the area it inspired him to work in Hollywood, in the entertainment industry, despite not knowing how to read or write music.

==Music career==
===1960s===
After his release from jail, White left gang life and began a musical career at the beginning of the 1960s in singing groups. He first released &quot;Too Far to Turn Around&quot; in 1960 as part of The Upfronts before working for various small independent labels in Los Angeles. He also recorded several singles under his own name in the early 1960s, backed by vocal groups The Atlantics (for the Rampart and Faro labels) and The Majestics (for the Linda and Jordan labels). White had no involvement with Bob &amp; Earl&#x27;s 1963 hit single &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot;, a song he has sometimes been credited with producing; in his 1999 autobiography, White confirmed the song had been produced by Gene Page, who had worked with him on many of his 1970s successes.

In 1965, White produced &quot;Feel Aw Right&quot; by The Bel Cantos, released on the Downey label. He recorded his debut single, &quot;Man Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27;&quot;/&quot;I Don&#x27;t Need It&quot;, released under the name &quot;Lee Barry&quot; on Downey in 1966. He also co-wrote &quot;Together Forever&quot;, released by Pat Powdrill &amp; the Powerdrills in 1967.

In the mid-&#x27;60s, Bob Keane of Del-Fi Records hired him as an A&amp;R man for his new Bronco Records imprint, and White started working with the label&#x27;s artists, including Viola Wills and The Bobby Fuller Four, as a songwriter, session musician, and arranger. He discovered singer Felice Taylor and arranged her song &quot;I Feel Love Comin&#x27; On&quot;, co-written with his friend Paul Politi. It became a big hit in the UK. Other charting hits written by White and Politi for her included &quot;It May Be Winter Outside (But in My Heart It&#x27;s Spring)&quot; and &quot;Under the Influence of Love&quot;. Bronco issued one of White&#x27;s first singles, 1967&#x27;s &quot;All in the Run of a Day&quot;, produced by Keane and White itself. White also wrote &quot;Doin&#x27; the Banana Split&quot; for TV bubblegum pop act The Banana Splits in 1968.

In 1969, White was signed by Forward Records of Los Angeles, a division of Transcontinental Entertainment Corporation, as a producer.

===1970s as producer===
In 1972, White got his big break producing a girl group he had discovered called Love Unlimited. Formed in imitative style of the Motown girl group the Supremes, the group members had gradually honed their talents with White for two years until they signed contracts with Uni Records. His friend Paul Politi told him about music industry businessman Larry Nunes, who helped to finance their album. After it was recorded, Nunes took the recording to Russ Regan, who was the head of the Uni label owned by MCA. The album, 1972&#x27;s &quot;From A Girl&#x27;s Point of View We Give to You... Love Unlimited&quot;, became the first of White&#x27;s string of long-titled albums and singles.

White produced, wrote and arranged their classic soul ballad &quot;Walkin&#x27; in the Rain with the One I Love&quot;, which climbed to No. 14 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Pop chart and No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in late 1972. It became White&#x27;s first million selling single as a writer and producer. This single also reached No. 12 in the UK chart. White&#x27;s voice can clearly be heard in this piece as he plays the lover who answers the phone call of the female lead.

Soon after, Regan left Uni for 20th Century Records. Without Regan, White&#x27;s relationship with Uni soured. With his relationship with Uni over and Love Unlimited contract-bound with the label, White was able to switch both his production deal and the group to 20th Century Records. They recorded several other hits throughout the 1970s, &quot;I Belong to You&quot;, which spent over five months on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in 1974 including a week at No. 1 and &quot;Under the Influence of Love Unlimited&quot;, which hit No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop album charts. White married the lead singer of the group, Glodean James, on July 4, 1974.

===The Love Unlimited Orchestra===
In 1973, White created The Love Unlimited Orchestra, a 40-piece orchestral group to be used originally as a backing band for the girl-group Love Unlimited. However, White had other plans, and in 1973, he released a single with &quot;Love&#x27;s Theme&quot; (written by him and played by the orchestra), which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop charts. Later, in 1974, he made the first album of the Love Unlimited Orchestra, &quot;Rhapsody in White&quot;, containing &quot;Love&#x27;s Theme&quot;. White would continue to make albums with the orchestra, achieving some successes such as: &quot;Rhapsody in White&quot;; &quot;Satin Soul&quot;; &quot;Forever in Love&quot;; &quot;Midnight Groove&quot;; &quot;My Sweet Summer Suite&quot;, Remake of &quot;Theme From King Kong&quot;. The orchestra ceased to make albums in 1983 but continued to support White as a backing band.

===1970s solo career===
White wanted to work with another act, but decided to work with a solo male artist. While working on a few demos for a male singer, he made three song demos of himself singing and playing, but Nunes heard them and insisted that he re-record and release them himself as a solo recording artist. After arguing for days about it, White was finally persuaded to release the songs himself, although he was initially reluctant to step out behind the microphone.

He then wrote several other songs and recorded them for what eventually became an entire album of music. He was going to use the name &quot;White Heat&quot;, but decided on using his given name instead. White was still hesitating up to the time the label copy was made. It eventually became White&#x27;s first solo album, 1973&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Got So Much to Give&quot;. It included the title track and his first solo chart hit, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby&quot;, which also rose to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts as well as No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop charts in 1973 and stayed in the top 40 for many weeks.

Other chart hits by White included:

* &quot;Never, Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; (No. 2 R&amp;B, No. 7 Pop in 1973)
* &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe&quot; (No. 1 Pop and R&amp;B in 1974)
* &quot;You&#x27;re the First, the Last, My Everything&quot; (No. 1 R&amp;B, No. 2 Pop in 1974)
* &quot;What Am I Gonna Do with You&quot; (No. 1 R&amp;B, No. 8 Pop in 1975)
* &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; (No. 4 R&amp;B in 1976)
* &quot;It&#x27;s Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next to Me&quot; (No. 1 R&amp;B, No. 4 Pop in 1977), and 
* &quot;Your Sweetness Is My Weakness&quot; (No. 2 R&amp;B in 1978)

among others.

White also had a strong following in the UK, where he scored five Top 10 hits and a No. 1 for &quot;You&#x27;re the First, the Last, My Everything&quot;. Due to his large frame, facial hair, and deep voice, he was given the nickname &quot;The Walrus of Love&quot; in the UK and in the US, &quot;Dr. Love&quot;, &quot;Mr. Love&quot;, &quot;Prince of Pillow Talk&quot;, &quot;Ambassador of Romance&quot;, &quot;King of Disco&quot; &quot;The Maestro&quot; or &quot;Guru of Love&quot;.

After six years, White left 20th Century in 1979 to launch his own label, Unlimited Gold, with CBS/Columbia Records.

===1980s===
Although his success on the pop charts slowed down as the disco era came to an end, he maintained a loyal following throughout his career. Despite several albums over the next three years, he failed to repeat his earlier successes, with no singles managing to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, except for 1982&#x27;s &quot;Change&quot;, climbing into the Billboard R&amp;B Top 20 (No. 12). His label venture was exacting a heavy financial cost on White, so he concentrated on mostly touring and finally folded his label in 1983.

After four years, he signed with A&amp;M Records, and with the release of 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Right Night &amp; Barry White&quot;, the single entitled &quot;Sho&#x27; You Right&quot; made it to the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts, peaking at No. 17.

In 1989, he released &quot;The Man Is Back!&quot; and with it had three top 40 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts: &quot;Super Lover&quot;, which made it to No. 34, &quot;I Wanna Do It Good to Ya&quot;, which made it to No. 26, and &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot;, which made it to No. 32.

===1990s===
A 1970s nostalgia fad allowed White to enjoy a renewed wave of popularity in the 1990s. After participating in the song &quot;The Secret Garden (Sweet Seduction Suite)&quot; from Quincy Jones&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Back on the Block&quot;, White mounted an effective comeback with several albums, each more successful than the one before. He returned to the top of the charts in 1991 with the album &quot;Put Me in Your Mix&quot;, which reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Albums chart and the song by the same name reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B singles chart.

In 1994, White released &quot;The Icon Is Love&quot;, which went to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B album charts, and the single &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot; gave him his first No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B singles chart in almost 20 years. The album was nominated for a Grammy in the Best R&amp;B Album category, but lost to TLC&#x27;s &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;.

In 1996, White recorded the duet &quot;In Your Wildest Dreams&quot; with Tina Turner. 1996 also saw the release of &quot;Space Jam&quot; and its soundtrack, on which White had a duet with Chris Rock, called &quot;Basketball Jones&quot;, a remake of Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s &quot;Basketball Jones&quot; from 1973.

White&#x27;s final album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Staying Power&quot;, resulted in his last hit song &quot;Staying Power&quot;, which placed No. 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts. The single won him two Grammy Awards in the categories Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance.

His autobiography, &quot;Love Unlimited&quot;, written with Marc Eliot, was published in 1999 by Broadway Books.

==Acting career==

Over the course of his career, White sometimes did voice-over work for television and movies. He voiced the character Brother Bear in the film &quot;Coonskin&quot; (1975). He voiced himself on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Whacking Day&quot; (1993 (season 4 episode 20))

White played the role of a bus driver for a Prodigy commercial in 1995, and he also portrayed the voice of a rabbit in a Good Seasons salad-dressing-mix commercial, singing a song called &quot;You Can&#x27;t Bottle Love&quot;. In addition, he did some work for car commercials, including for Oldsmobile, and later on, Jeep. White also provided voice-over for Arby&#x27;s Restaurant commercials on television and radio to promote its &quot;Market Fresh&quot; menu. White&#x27;s voice can also be heard in Apple&#x27;s first iBook commercial. White made three guest appearances on the comedy-drama television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, as his music was often featured on the show in dream sequences.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages ===
White was first married to his childhood sweetheart, identified as just Mary in his autobiography, by the time he was 19. They separated in 1969 and later divorced.

In 1974, White married singer Glodean James. The couple collaborated on the 1981 album &quot;Barry &amp; Glodean&quot;. They reportedly separated in 1988, but they were still legally married until White&#x27;s death in 2003, although they lived separate lives. Although estranged from White for over a decade, as his widow she was made sole executor of his estate.

=== Children ===
White had at least nine children. By the age of 16, White had fathered two children with his first wife Mary. They had four children together. In 2017, his son Darryl White from his first marriage sued his estate, claiming he was cut off financially.

White had four children with his second wife Glodean James. Their daughter Shaherah was his personal assistant. Barry Jr. played in the Love Unlimited Orchestra and was also his tour manager. White&#x27;s son MacKevin worked in his publishing administration.

White had a daughter, Denise Donnell, born in 1962 to Gurtha Allen. She did not discover who her biological father was until 1988. She was accepted by White and with his help she changed her name to Denise White. In 2016, she sued White&#x27;s estate after she stopped receiving money.

After White&#x27;s death in 2003, his girlfriend Katherine Denton claimed her infant daughter Barriana was his biological child. Denton also claimed that she was owed money and personal items that White had promised to give her. Paternity tests revealed that he was not the father of her child and Denton subsequently lost her court case.

==Health problems and death==
White was overweight for most of his adult life, and apparently smoked approximately 150 cigarettes a day. 
He reportedly weighed up to .

While undergoing dialysis and awaiting a kidney transplant in May 2003, White suffered a severe stroke, which forced him to retire from public life. He also suffered multiple seizures in his last few weeks.

White&#x27;s unstable health prevented him from receiving a new kidney, and he died on July 4, 2003, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after suffering cardiac arrest. He was 58 years old. His remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered in the ocean off the California coast.

==Legacy==
On September 20, 2004, White was posthumously inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame at a ceremony held in New York. On September 12, 2013, which would have been White&#x27;s 69th birthday, he was posthumously awarded the 2,506th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6914 Hollywood Boulevard in the category of recording. The show &quot;Counting Cars&quot; paid tribute to White by restoring the last car he owned for his widow, Glodean.

In an obituary referring to White by his nickname, &quot;The Walrus of Love&quot;, the BBC recalled &quot;the rich timbres of one of the most distinctive soul voices of his generation, about which it was once said: &#x27;If chocolate fudge cake could sing, it would sound like Barry White.&#x27;&quot;

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked White at number 56 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

== Awards and nominations ==
White was nominated for 11 Grammy Awards, winning two for &quot;Staying Power&quot; at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000.

<text>Steven Karl Zoltán Brust (born November 23, 1955) is an American fantasy and science fiction author of Hungarian descent. He is best known for his series of novels about the assassin Vlad Taltos, one of a disdained minority group of humans living on a world called Dragaera. His recent novels also include &quot;The Incrementalists&quot; (2013) and its sequel &quot;The Skill of Our Hands&quot; (2017), with co-author Skyler White.

As a drummer and singer-songwriter, Brust has recorded one solo album and two albums as a member of Cats Laughing. Brust also co-wrote songs on two albums recorded in the mid-1990s by the band Boiled in Lead.

==Writing career==

===The Dragaeran books===
The Vlad Taltos series, written as high fantasy with a science fiction underpinning, is set on a planet called Dragaera. The events of the series take place in an Empire mostly inhabited and ruled by the Dragaerans, a genetically engineered humanoid species, having characteristics such as greatly extended lifespans and heights averaging about seven feet. Referred to as &quot;elfs&quot; by some humans, they refer to themselves as &quot;human&quot;. The Dragaeran Empire controls a region that is &quot;enclouded&quot; by a perpetual overcast that blocks the sun from view.

Vlad Taltos is one of the human minority (known by Dragaerans as &quot;Easterners&quot;), which exists as a lower class in the Empire. Vlad also practices the human art of witchcraft; &quot;táltos&quot; is Hungarian for a kind of supernatural person in folklore. Though human, he is a citizen of the Empire because his social-climbing father bought a title in one of the less reputable of the 17 Dragaeran Great Houses. The only Great House that sells memberships this way is, not coincidentally, also the one that maintains a criminal organization. Vlad proves surprisingly successful in this organization. Despite being a human and a criminal, he has a number of high-ranking Dragaeran friends and often gets caught up in important events.

Brust has written 17 published novels in the series, which is proposed to run to nineteen novels – one named for each of the Great Houses, one named for Vlad himself (&quot;Taltos&quot;), and a final novel which Brust has said will be titled &quot;The Final Contract&quot;. The first three novels resemble private-eye detective stories, perhaps the closest being Robert B. Parker&#x27;s Spenser series. The later novels are more varied than the first three. Though they read like fantasy, there are science-fictional explanations for some things.

Brust has also written another series set in Dragaera, the &quot;Khaavren Romances&quot;, set centuries before Vlad&#x27;s time. Since Dragaerans live for thousands of years, many characters appear in both series. It is partly an homage to Alexandre Dumas père&#x27;s novels about The Three Musketeers, and is five volumes long, following the pattern of Dumas&#x27; series. The books are presented as historical novels written by Paarfi of Roundwood, a Dragaeran roughly contemporary with Vlad. Paarfi&#x27;s old-fashioned, elaborate, and highly verbose writing is explicitly based on Dumas&#x27;, though with a dialogue style that is, at times, based on Tom Stoppard&#x27;s wordgames in &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; (according to Pamela Dean&#x27;s introduction to &quot;Five Hundred Years After&quot;).
&quot;The Baron of Magister Valley&quot;, an additional Paarfi novel, is modeled after Dumas&#x27;s &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.

The two series are finally brought together in the thirteenth novel in the Vlad series, &quot;Tiassa&quot;, which can also be viewed as the sixth novel in the Khaavren series. &quot;Tiassa&quot; comprises what are in effect three related novellas, each told in a different style and connected by a common theme. The first section reads like the first three novels in the series, with first-person narration by Vlad but including Khaavren&#x27;s son, Piro; the second section has a different viewpoint character in each of its chapters; and the third section is narrated by Paarfi in the style of the earlier &quot;Khaavren Romances&quot;, with Khaavren as the viewpoint character and interacting with Vlad.

===Short stories===
Most of Brust&#x27;s short stories are set in shared universes. These include Emma Bull&#x27;s and Will Shetterly&#x27;s &quot;Liavek&quot;, Robert Asprin&#x27;s &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot;, Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; and Terri Windling&#x27;s &quot;Borderland Series&quot;.

===Style and literary theory===
Brust was a founding member of a Minnesota-based writers&#x27; group called The Scribblies, which included Emma Bull, Pamela Dean, Will Shetterly, Nate Bucklin, Kara Dalkey, and Patricia Wrede. He also was a founding member of the Pre-Joycean Fellowship.

He has rejected a distinction between science fiction and fantasy, stating that no belief in such a distinction can withstand an encounter with the writing of Roger Zelazny.

==== Writing style ====
There is a certain amount of variation in the writing style amongst the Taltos novels, as well as between Brust&#x27;s various series. Brust uses a different narrative approach in almost every novel in the Taltos series. Some of these approaches are more purely stylistic and have minor effects on the actual story-telling; some are profound and involve the point of view of characters whom the reader never expected to get to know so well.

Further, as the writing of the Taltos novels has spanned over four decades, they have been influenced by events in Brust&#x27;s own life. A fascination with the Mafia – subsequently brought into a somewhat shocking perspective by the murder of a friend – profoundly influenced his storylines, as did the breakup of his marriage. The events and arguments of his books, especially &quot;Teckla&quot;, are acknowledged by Brust to be influenced by his lifelong interest in Marxist theory and practice. Brust&#x27;s parents were activists in the Workers League, the predecessor to the Socialist Equality Party, and he continues to identify as a &quot;Trotskyist sympathizer,&quot; linking to the SEP-affiliated World Socialist Web Site on his personal website. He endorsed the SEP&#x27;s presidential candidates in the 2016 US elections.

==== Literary theory ====
In contrast to contemporary academic studies in literature, Brust has put forward what he called &quot;The Cool Stuff Theory of Literature&quot;:

All literature consists of whatever the writer thinks is cool. The reader will like the book to the degree that he agrees with the writer about what&#x27;s cool. And that works all the way from the external trappings to the level of metaphor, subtext, and the way one uses words. In other words, I happen not to think that full-plate armor and great big honking greatswords are cool. I don&#x27;t like &#x27;em. I like cloaks and rapiers. So I write stories with a lot of cloaks and rapiers in &#x27;em, &#x27;cause that&#x27;s cool. Guys who like military hardware, who think advanced military hardware is cool, are not gonna jump all over my books, because they have other ideas about what&#x27;s cool.

Brust elaborated, &quot;The novel should be understood as a structure built to accommodate the greatest possible amount of cool stuff.&quot;

==== Motifs ====
The character Devera, usually a cute brown-eyed girl of about nine, appears as a motif in all of Brust&#x27;s novels. In the Dragaeran books, her name is Devera. She is the (future) daughter of another character and seems to be able to appear anywhere in time and space. In Brust&#x27;s non-Dragaeran books her appearances are usually brief and not always obvious.

== Musical recordings and performances ==
Brust is a singer-songwriter and drummer who has recorded a solo album, and who has played in the Minneapolis-based folk rock band Cats Laughing, and with the Albany Free Traders, and Morrigan.

Brust also co-wrote two songs on the 1994 album &quot;Antler Dance&quot; by the band Boiled in Lead (BiL), as well as many of the songs on BiL&#x27;s 1995 multimedia CD &quot;Songs from The Gypsy&quot;.

===Cats Laughing===
 Cats Laughing released two albums with Brust as the drummer, in 1988 and 1990. Brust also contributed as a songwriter and vocalist. The 1990 album &quot;Another Way to Travel&quot; features cover art that depicts the band members and a vehicle known as the Catmobile, the band vehicle for Cats Laughing. The car, owned by Brust, was a Cadillac ambulance, painted yellow, light blue, and dark blue, with murals.

On April 3, 2015, Brust performed as part of Cats Laughing in a reunion concert at the Minicon 50 science fiction convention in Bloomington, Minnesota. In March 2016, Cats Laughing released a double CD of their 2015 reunion, &quot;A Long Time Gone&quot;, as well as a DVD by the same title with documentary concert footage.

===Solo===

&quot;A Rose for Iconoclastes&quot;, a folk (or folk pop) album released in 1993, is Brust&#x27;s only solo album. The title is a reference to &quot;A Rose for Ecclesiastes&quot;, a short story by Brust&#x27;s literary hero and mentor Roger Zelazny.

Twelve of the fourteen songs were written or co-written by Brust. The album was produced by Adam Stemple, a fellow fantasy writer and member of Cats Laughing.

===&quot;Songs from The Gypsy&quot; (1995)===
 The 1995 enhanced CD &quot;Songs from The Gypsy&quot;, by the band Boiled in Lead, featured songs written by Brust and Adam Stemple, as well as the full text of Brust&#x27;s novel &quot;The Gypsy.&quot;

AllMusic reviewer Steven McDonald called &quot;Songs from The Gypsy&quot; &quot;an example of Brust&#x27;s serious songwriting working well.&quot;

Conversely, a critical review by AllMusic&#x27;s Roch Parisien emphasized that &quot;&quot;Songs from The Gypsy&quot; represents a failure of multimedia integration. As an audio CD, the disc serves up ten songs, ranging from acoustic trad to bluesy rockers, that ironically form a less cohesive whole than previous Boiled in Lead releases. The better numbers (like the title track) incorporate Celtic rock with Hungarian, Middle Eastern, and other interesting worldbeat influences.&quot; Parisien found the album&#x27;s integration with the novel unsuccessful, in that the novel&#x27;s 17 chapters were presented as &quot;scrollable text only, which also intersperse some 80 song lyric excerpts that you can play from hot buttons. Annoyingly, you must flip back to the main menu index to move from one chapter to the next.&quot; Parisien concluded, &quot;Despite Brust&#x27;s engrossingly poetic, impressionist story inspired by Hungarian folk tales and revolving around three Gypsy brothers, the project does not overcome the primary limitation of bringing literature to the computer screen, that being that the computer offers an inhospitable environment for viewing literature-length text.&quot; The review, written in 1995, predated a wave of popular e-book readers that began to emerge about ten years later.

===Other performances===
Brust has performed dramatically in several Shockwave Radio Theater productions, notably &quot;Closing Ceremonies (aka The Fall of the House of Usherette)&quot; and &quot;PBS Liavek&quot;.

==Award nominations==

Brust&#x27;s short story &quot;When The Bow Breaks&quot; was nominated for the 1998 Nebula Award.

&quot;Five Hundred Years After&quot; was nominated for the 1995 Locus Poll Award (Best Fantasy Novel). Other novels nominated for various Locus Poll Awards were &quot;Brokedown Palace,&quot; &quot;The Gypsy,&quot; &quot;Agyar,&quot; and &quot;Freedom &amp; Necessity.&quot;

&quot;Dragon&quot; was a finalist for the 1999 Minnesota Book Awards in the Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction category. &quot;Freedom and Necessity&quot; was a 1998 finalist for the same category, while &quot;The Phoenix Guards&quot; was a finalist in 1992.

Brust discovered in August 2006 that he had made the &quot;New York Times&quot; extended bestseller list at number 30 with &quot;Dzur&quot;. He mentioned his ambivalence on this subject online. &quot;SciFi Wire&quot; posted an interview with Brust after &quot;Dzur&quot; came out.

==Bibliography==
Brust&#x27;s novels have been translated into numerous languages, including Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, Estonian, French, German, Hebrew, Polish, Russian, and Spanish.

===Dragaera===
There are two series set in the world of Dragaera, the &quot;Khaavren Romances&quot; and the &quot;Vlad Taltos&quot; novels. They are set in different periods in the world, but some characters are common to both series.

==== Standalone Dragaera novel ====
* &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot; (1986)

==== Paarfi&#x27;s historical romances ====
A series of Dragaeran historical romances, which take place centuries earlier than the Vlad Taltos novels, was written in the narrative voice of Paarfi of Roundwood, a Dragaeran historian. Paarfi describes these novels as works of history written for a popular audience, and published with great success during the reigns of Empresses Zerika IV and Norathar II.

* The Khaavren Romances consist of three works, published as five books. The third and longest work, Paarfi&#x27;s account of the Interregnum titled &quot;The Viscount of Adrilankha&quot;, was published in three volumes as individually-titled books.

===Introductions by Brust===
* In 1987, Tor Books published the gamebook &quot;Dzurlord (A Crossroads Adventure in the World of Steven Brust&#x27;s Jhereg)&quot;. Brust wrote the introduction for this book, which introduced readers to the world of Dragaera and its inhabitants.
* Tor also published &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; in paperback in 1994. Brust introduced the edition, saying that this translation (anonymous, originally published in 1888) was his favorite.
* Brust contributed the introduction for &quot;Manna from Heaven&quot;. Wildside Press published this collection of stories from Roger Zelazny in 2003.

== Trivia ==
=== References in other media ===
* Brust&#x27;s book &quot;Dragon&quot; is the subject of an argument in the webcomic &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;. Cartoonist Jerry Holkins later noted that the comic was based on an actual conversation about Brust&#x27;s work at a convention.
* Brust&#x27;s band, Cats Laughing, appears in issue no. 5 of the Marvel comic book &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Brust is the only member of the band who is both seen onstage and named. Emma Bull also appears, but names everyone in the band except herself. Brust was seen again in a one-shot special issue, &quot;Excalibur: Mojo Mayhem&quot;, in which the mutant superhero Shadowcat attends a Cats Laughing concert in Edinburgh and mentions previously having seen the band at Windycon.

=== Book title nicknames ===
Brust is known for his propensity to give his books alternate titles for his own amusement. These have cropped up in numerous interviews and online forums, starting with &quot;Jarhead&quot; for &quot;Jhereg&quot;. Examples include:

* Jarhead (&quot;Jhereg&quot;)
* The Rain in Spain (&quot;To Reign in Hell&quot;)
* Yentl (&quot;Yendi&quot;)
* Ripple (&quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;)
* Tacky (&quot;Teckla&quot;)

* Milquetoast (&quot;Taltos&quot;)
* Shit Happens (&quot;Cowboy Feng&#x27;s Space Bar and Grille&quot;)

* Spit (&quot;Hawk&quot;)
* Good Goys (&quot;Good Guys&quot;)
* Barista (&quot;Vallista&quot;)
* Tall Mouth (&quot;Tsalmoth&quot;)

Brust does not have nicknames for collaborations out of respect for his collaborators, stating &quot;It&#x27;s one thing to not want to take myself seriously, and another thing to—I want to take them seriously.&quot;

<text>A phase diagram in physical chemistry, engineering, mineralogy, and materials science is a type of chart used to show conditions (pressure, temperature, etc.) at which thermodynamically distinct phases (such as solid, liquid or gaseous states) occur and coexist at equilibrium.

== Overview ==
Common components of a phase diagram are &quot;lines of equilibrium&quot; or &quot;phase boundaries&quot;, which refer to lines that mark conditions under which multiple phases can coexist at equilibrium. Phase transitions occur along lines of equilibrium. Metastable phases are not shown in phase diagrams as, despite their common occurrence, they are not equilibrium phases.

Triple points are points on phase diagrams where lines of equilibrium intersect. Triple points mark conditions at which three different phases can coexist. For example, the water phase diagram has a triple point corresponding to the single temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous water can coexist in a stable equilibrium ( and a partial vapor pressure of ). The pressure on a pressure-temperature diagram (such as the water phase diagram shown) is the partial pressure of the substance in question. 

The solidus is the temperature below which the substance is stable in the solid state. The liquidus is the temperature above which the substance is stable in a liquid state. There may be a gap between the solidus and liquidus; within the gap, the substance consists of a mixture of crystals and liquid (like a &quot;slurry&quot;).

Working fluids are often categorized on the basis of the shape of their phase diagram.

== Types ==

=== 2-dimensional diagrams ===
====Pressure vs temperature====
 The simplest phase diagrams are pressure–temperature diagrams of a single simple substance, such as water. The axes correspond to the pressure and temperature. The phase diagram shows, in pressure–temperature space, the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of solid, liquid, and gas.

The curves on the phase diagram show the points where the free energy (and other derived properties) becomes non-analytic: their derivatives with respect to the coordinates (temperature and pressure in this example) change discontinuously (abruptly). For example, the heat capacity of a container filled with ice will change abruptly as the container is heated past the melting point. The open spaces, where the free energy is analytic, correspond to single phase regions. Single phase regions are separated by lines of non-analytical behavior, where phase transitions occur, which are called phase boundaries.

In the diagram on the right, the phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the critical point. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable, in what is known as a supercritical fluid. In water, the critical point occurs at around &quot;T&quot;c = , &quot;p&quot;c = and &quot;ρ&quot;c = 356 kg/m3.

The existence of the liquid–gas critical point reveals a slight ambiguity in labelling the single phase regions. When going from the liquid to the gaseous phase, one usually crosses the phase boundary, but it is possible to choose a path that never crosses the boundary by going to the right of the critical point. Thus, the liquid and gaseous phases can blend continuously into each other. The solid–liquid phase boundary can only end in a critical point if the solid and liquid phases have the same symmetry group.

For most substances, the solid–liquid phase boundary (or fusion curve) in the phase diagram has a positive slope so that the melting point increases with pressure. This is true whenever the solid phase is denser than the liquid phase. The greater the pressure on a given substance, the closer together the molecules of the substance are brought to each other, which increases the effect of the substance&#x27;s intermolecular forces. Thus, the substance requires a higher temperature for its molecules to have enough energy to break out of the fixed pattern of the solid phase and enter the liquid phase. A similar concept applies to liquid–gas phase changes.

Water is an exception which has a solid-liquid boundary with negative slope so that the melting point decreases with pressure. This occurs because ice (solid water) is less dense than liquid water, as shown by the fact that ice floats on water. At a molecular level, ice is less dense because it has a more extensive network of hydrogen bonding which requires a greater separation of water molecules. Other exceptions include antimony and bismuth. 

At very high pressures above 50 GPa (500 000 atm), liquid nitrogen undergoes a liquid-liquid phase transition to a polymeric form and becomes denser than solid nitrogen at the same pressure. Under these conditions therefore, solid nitrogen also floats in its liquid.

The value of the slope d&quot;P&quot;/d&quot;T&quot; is given by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation for fusion (melting)

:formula_1

where Δ&quot;H&quot;fus is the heat of fusion which is always positive, and Δ&quot;V&quot;fus is the volume change for fusion. For most substances Δ&quot;V&quot;fus is positive so that the slope is positive. However for water and other exceptions, Δ&quot;V&quot;fus is negative so that the slope is negative.

====Other thermodynamic properties====
In addition to temperature and pressure, other thermodynamic properties may be graphed in phase diagrams. Examples of such thermodynamic properties include specific volume, specific enthalpy, or specific entropy. For example, single-component graphs of temperature vs. specific entropy (&quot;T&quot; vs. &quot;s&quot;) for water/steam or for a refrigerant are commonly used to illustrate thermodynamic cycles such as a Carnot cycle, Rankine cycle, or vapor-compression refrigeration cycle.

Any two thermodynamic quantities may be shown on the horizontal and vertical axes of a two-dimensional diagram. Additional thermodynamic quantities may each be illustrated in increments as a series of lines—curved, straight, or a combination of curved and straight. Each of these iso-lines represents the thermodynamic quantity at a certain constant value.

== 3-dimensional diagrams ==

It is possible to envision three-dimensional (3D) graphs showing three thermodynamic quantities. For example, for a single component, a 3D Cartesian coordinate type graph can show temperature (&quot;T&quot;) on one axis, pressure (&quot;p&quot;) on a second axis, and specific volume (&quot;v&quot;) on a third. Such a 3D graph is sometimes called a &quot;p&quot;–&quot;v&quot;–&quot;T&quot; diagram. The equilibrium conditions are shown as curves on a curved surface in 3D with areas for solid, liquid, and vapor phases and areas where solid and liquid, solid and vapor, or liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium. A line on the surface called a triple line is where solid, liquid and vapor can all coexist in equilibrium. The critical point remains a point on the surface even on a 3D phase diagram.

An orthographic projection of the 3D &quot;p&quot;–&quot;v&quot;–&quot;T&quot; graph showing pressure and temperature as the vertical and horizontal axes collapses the 3D plot into the standard 2D pressure–temperature diagram. When this is done, the solid–vapor, solid–liquid, and liquid–vapor surfaces collapse into three corresponding curved lines meeting at the triple point, which is the collapsed orthographic projection of the triple line.

===Binary mixtures===
Other much more complex types of phase diagrams can be constructed, particularly when more than one pure component is present. In that case, concentration becomes an important variable. Phase diagrams with more than two dimensions can be constructed that show the effect of more than two variables on the phase of a substance. Phase diagrams can use other variables in addition to or in place of temperature, pressure and composition, for example the strength of an applied electrical or magnetic field, and they can also involve substances that take on more than just three states of matter.

One type of phase diagram plots temperature against the relative concentrations of two substances in a mixture called a &quot;binary phase diagram&quot;, as shown at right. Such a mixture can be either a solid solution, eutectic or peritectic, among others. These two types of mixtures result in very different graphs. Another type of binary phase diagram is a &quot;boiling-point diagram&quot; for a mixture of two components, i. e. chemical compounds. For two particular volatile components at a certain pressure such as atmospheric pressure, a boiling-point diagram shows what vapor (gas) compositions are in equilibrium with given liquid compositions depending on temperature. In a typical binary boiling-point diagram, temperature is plotted on a vertical axis and mixture composition on a horizontal axis.

A two component diagram with components A and B in an &quot;ideal&quot; solution is shown. The construction of a liquid vapor phase diagram assumes an ideal liquid solution obeying Raoult&#x27;s law and an ideal gas mixture obeying Dalton&#x27;s law of partial pressure. A tie line from the liquid to the gas at constant pressure would indicate the two compositions of the liquid and gas respectively.

A simple example diagram with hypothetical components 1 and 2 in a non-azeotropic mixture is shown at right. The fact that there are two separate curved lines joining the boiling points of the pure components means that the vapor composition is usually not the same as the liquid composition the vapor is in equilibrium with. See Vapor–liquid equilibrium for more information.

In addition to the above-mentioned types of phase diagrams, there are many other possible combinations. Some of the major features of phase diagrams include congruent points, where a solid phase transforms directly into a liquid. There is also the peritectoid, a point where two solid phases combine into one solid phase during cooling. The inverse of this, when one solid phase transforms into two solid phases during cooling, is called the eutectoid.

A complex phase diagram of great technological importance is that of the iron–carbon system for less than 7% carbon (see steel).

The x-axis of such a diagram represents the concentration variable of the mixture. As the mixtures are typically far from dilute and their density as a function of temperature is usually unknown, the preferred concentration measure is mole fraction. A volume-based measure like molarity would be inadvisable.

===Ternary phase diagrams===
A system with three components is called a ternary system. At constant pressure the maximum number of independent variables is three – the temperature and two concentration values. For a representation of ternary equilibria a three-dimensional phase diagram is required. Often such a diagram is drawn with the composition as a horizontal plane and the temperature on an axis perpendicular to this plane. To represent composition in a ternary system an equilateral triangle is used, called Gibbs triangle (see also Ternary plot). 

The temperature scale is plotted on the axis perpendicular to the composition triangle. Thus, the space model of a ternary phase diagram is a right-triangular prism. The prism sides represent corresponding binary systems A-B, B-C, A-C.

However, the most common methods to present phase equilibria in a ternary system are the following:
1) projections on the concentration triangle ABC of the liquidus, solidus, solvus surfaces;
2) isothermal sections;
3) vertical sections.

===Crystals===
Polymorphic and polyamorphic substances have multiple crystal or amorphous phases, which can be graphed in a similar fashion to solid, liquid, and gas phases.

===Mesophases===
Some organic materials pass through intermediate states between solid and liquid; these states are called mesophases. Attention has been directed to mesophases because they enable display devices and have become commercially important through the so-called liquid-crystal technology. Phase diagrams are used to describe the occurrence of mesophases.

<text>Arnhem ( ; ; Ernems: &quot;Èrnem&quot;) is a city and municipality situated in the eastern part of the Netherlands, near the German border. It is the capital of the province of Gelderland, located on both banks of the rivers Nederrijn and Sint-Jansbeek, which was the source of the city&#x27;s development. 

Arnhem is home to the Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen, ArtEZ Institute of the Arts, Netherlands Open Air Museum, Airborne Museum &#x27;Hartenstein&#x27;, Royal Burgers&#x27; Zoo, NOC*NSF and National Sports Centre Papendal. The north corner of the municipality is part of the Hoge Veluwe National Park. It is approximately in area, consisting of heathlands, sand dunes, and woodlands.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The oldest archeological findings of human activity around Arnhem are two firestones of about 70,000 years ago. These come from the Stone Age, when the Neanderthals lived in this part of Europe. In Schuytgraaf, remnants of a hunters camp from around 5000 BC have been discovered. In Schaarsbergen, twelve grave mounds were found from 2400 BC, which brought the so-called Neolithic Revolution to the area of Arnhem, which meant the rise of the farmers.

The earliest settlement in Arnhem dates from 1500 BC, of which traces have been found on the Hoogkamp, where the Van Goyenstraat is currently located. In the inner city, around the Sint-Jansbeek, traces of settlement have been found from around 700 BC, while the first traces south of the Rhine have been found dating to around 500 BC, in the &quot;Schuytgraaf&quot;.

Though the early tracks of settlements did show that the early residents of Arnhem descended from the forests on the hills, Arnhem was not built on the banks of the river Rhine, but a little higher along the Sint-Jansbeek. Arnhem arose on the location where the road between Nijmegen and Utrecht and Zutphen split. Seven streams provided the city with water, and only when the flow of the Rhine was changed in 1530, was the city located on the river.

=== Middle Ages ===

Arnhem was first mentioned as such in 893 as &quot;Arneym&quot; or &quot;Arentheym&quot;. In 1233, Count Otto II of Guelders from Zutphen, conferred city rights on the town, which had belonged to the abbey of Prüm, settled in, and fortified it. Arnhem entered the Hanseatic League in 1443. In 1473, it was captured by Charles the Bold of Burgundy.

=== 16th and 17th century ===

In 1514, Charles of Egmond, duke of Guelders, took it from the dukes of Burgundy; in 1543, it fell to the emperor Charles V. As capital of the so-called &quot;Kwartier van Veluwe&quot; it joined the Union of Utrecht during the Eighty Years&#x27; War in 1579. After its capture from the Spanish forces by Dutch and English troops in 1585 the city became part of the Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands. The French occupied the town from 1672 to 1674.

=== 18th and 19th century ===
From 1795 to 1813, it was reoccupied by the French, by both revolutionary and imperial forces.

In the early 19th century, the former fortifications were almost completely dismantled, to give space for town expansion. The &quot;Sabelspoort&quot; (Sabresgate) is the only remaining part of the medieval walls.

In the 19th century, Arnhem was a genteel resort town famous for its picturesque beauty. It was known as &quot;het Haagje van het oosten&quot; (The Little Hague of the East), mainly because a number of rich former sugar barons or planters from the Indies settled there, as they did in The Hague. Even now the city is famous for its parks and greenery. The urbanization in the north on hilly terrain is also quite unusual for the Netherlands.

=== World War II ===

During the German occupation (World War II), the occupiers operated a subcamp of the Herzogenbusch concentration camp in the city.
During Operation Market Garden (September 1944), the British 1st Airborne Division, under the command of Major-General Roy Urquhart, and the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade were given the task of securing the bridge at Arnhem.

Glider infantry and paratrooper units were landed into the area on 17 September and later. The bulk of the force was dropped rather far from the bridge and never met their objective. A small element of the British 1st Airborne, the 2nd Parachute Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel John D. Frost, managed to make its way as far as the bridge but was unable to secure both sides. The British troops encountered stiff resistance from the German 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, which had been stationed in and around the city.
The British force at the bridge eventually ran out of ammunition and was captured on 21 September, and a full withdrawal of the remaining forces was made on 26 September. These events were dramatized in the 1977 movie &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;. (The bridge scenes in the movie were shot in Deventer, where a similar bridge over the IJssel was available, as the area around Arnhem bridge had changed too much to represent WWII-era Arnhem). As a tribute, the rebuilt bridge was renamed &#x27;John Frost Bridge&#x27; after the commander of the paratroopers. The official commemoration is 17 September.

The current bridge is the third almost-identical bridge built at the same spot. The Dutch Army destroyed the first bridge when the German Army invaded the Netherlands in 1940. The second bridge was destroyed by the United States Army Air Forces shortly after the 1944 battle.

=== Liberation ===
A second battle of Arnhem took place in April 1945 when the city was liberated by the British 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division fighting as part of the First Canadian Army. The inhabitants of the city, who had been forcibly evacuated by the Germans during and after the battle, returned in the summer of 1945. The reconstruction of Arnhem took until 1969 to finally be completed.

Just outside Arnhem, in the town of Oosterbeek the Commonwealth War Graves Commission built the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery which contains the graves of most of those killed during the September landings, and many of those killed in later fighting in the area.

The city also hosted the 1980 Summer Paralympics.

== Geography ==
=== Neighbourhoods ===

The municipality of Arnhem consists of the city of Arnhem and the following surrounding suburbs and former villages:
* Elden, Netherlands (former village, now totally surrounded by other Arnhem neighbourhoods)
* Schaarsbergen

Arnhem consists of three districts (&quot;stadsdelen&quot;) and 24 neighbourhoods (&quot;wijken&quot;). Each neighbourhood has a number which corresponds to its postal code.

# Arnhem Centrum &quot;(Binnenstad)&quot; 
# Arnhem-North &quot;(Spijkerkwartier, Arnhemse Broek, Presikhaaf-West, Presikhaaf-East, St. Marten/Sonsbeek-Zuid, Klarendal, Velperweg, Alteveer en Cranevelt, Geitenkamp, Monnikenhuizen, Burgemeesterswijk/Hoogkamp, Heijenoord/Lombok, Klingelbeek)&quot; 
# Arnhem-South &quot;(Malburgen-West, Malburgen-East (North), Malburgen-East (South), De Laar East/West, Vredenburg/Kronenburg, Elderveld, Rijkerswoerd, Schuytgraaf)&quot;

=== Neighbouring villages ===
The outlying areas of the following villages are bordering the municipality of Arnhem directly, which means among others that in many a case a considerable number of their inhabitants originate from Arnhem.
* Velp
* Oosterbeek
* Driel
* Elst
* Huissen
* Wolfheze
* Rozendaal
* Westervoort
=== Proximity of border with Germany ===

The city lies approximately 15 kilometers from the border with Germany, and to some extent the westernmost villages in the municipality of Elten, Germany, function as dormitories for people who work in the Dutch city of Arnhem in part due to the immigration of Dutch people from the region that were attracted by the lower house pricing just across the border.

=== Climate ===

Arnhem features the same climate (Cfb, oceanic climate) as all of the Netherlands; however, its location on the foothills of the Veluwe, the largest forest in the Netherlands, contributes to some higher precipitation values.

== Places of interest ==
The &quot;Grote Kerk&quot; (St. Eusebius&#x27; Church), built 1452–1560, lost most of its tower during World War II, of which a part has been reconstructed to a modern design and opened in 1964. Officially the tower is not part of the church and is owned by the municipality.

The house of Maarten van Rossum, a general serving Duke Charles van Gelre, has been the town hall since 1830: The satyrs in its Renaissance ornamentation earned it the name &quot;Duivelshuis&quot; (devil&#x27;s house). The Netherlands Open Air Museum is located outside the city. It includes antique houses, farms, factories, and windmills from different parts of the Netherlands. Two other windmills stand in Arnhem itself, De Hoop and De Kroon.

The Royal Burgers&#x27; Zoo in Arnhem is one of the biggest and most-visited zoos in the Netherlands, featuring an underwater walkthrough, desert, mangrove, and rainforest. The GelreDome, the home of Vitesse Arnhem, the city&#x27;s Eredivisie team in football, is a unique facility that features a retractable roof and a slide-out grass pitch. The concept has been fully duplicated since then by the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, U.S., and partially by the Sapporo Dome in Japan (which has a sliding pitch but a fixed roof).

The KEMA Toren (formerly known as &quot;SEP Control Tower&quot;) is the highest structure of the town. It is a 140-m-high TV tower.

== Sport ==

The National Sports Centre Papendal is the national sports development centre of the Netherlands, located in Arnhem. The first event held at Papendal was the 1980 Summer Paralympics, from 21 June to 5 July. However the site was formally adopted and developed from 1993, after the merger of the Dutch National Olympic Committee (NOC) and the Nederlandse Sport Federatie (NSF).

NOC*NSF have 90 affiliated national sports organizations, representing about 2700 individual sports clubs. Papendal is also the training location of football club Vitesse Arnhem, and the club&#x27;s youth development system. Supporting facilities include a conference centre and hotel.

In preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics, in 2011 the facility built a replica of the proposed BMX racing track at the London Velopark venue. The track will host the second event on the 2011 UCI BMX World Championships, on 27 and 28 May 2011.

Since January 2013 Sports Centre Papendal officially split from NOC * NSF and thus as organization demerges. This split offers Sports Centre Papendal many commercial benefits. There are facilities for various sports, including athletics, cycling and more.

Sport in the city is principally focussed on its association football club Vitesse Arnhem and its stadium the GelreDome built for the UEFA Euro 2000. The club has enjoyed some success in the Eredivisie and has featured in the UEFA Cup competition. Their best result in the Eredivisie was third place in 1997–98. The club won the KNVB Cup in 2016–17.

Introdans is a dance company based in the city of Arnhem. In 2009 the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science designated Introdans part of the basic national infrastructure. In 2016 was the Giro d&#x27;Italia in Arnhem.

== Transport ==

Arnhem has had a main central railway station since 1845 – Arnhem Centraal railway station, which is serviced by several intercity lines and the Intercity-Express to Düsseldorf and further on to Frankfurt.

Until 2016, there were also NS International trains to other destinations abroad, with some coaches going as far as Moscow.

The intercity lines provide direct connections to Utrecht, Nijmegen and Zutphen. It is also the terminus for several local railway services. Arnhem has three other stations, namely Arnhem Velperpoort (since 1953), Arnhem Presikhaaf (since 1969) and Arnhem Zuid (since 2005).

KLM operates a bus from the train station to Schiphol Airport for its customers. Arnhem is unique in the Netherlands with its trolleybus system.

<text>Operation Market Garden was an Allied military operation during the Second World War fought in the German-occupied Netherlands from 17 to 25 September 1944. Its objective was to create a salient into German territory with a bridgehead over the Nederrijn (Lower Rhine River), creating an Allied invasion route into northern Germany. This was to be achieved by two sub-operations: seizing nine bridges with combined American and British airborne forces (&quot;Market&quot;) followed by British land forces swiftly following over the bridges (&quot;Garden&quot;).

The airborne operation was undertaken by the First Allied Airborne Army with the land operation by the British Second Army, with XXX Corps moving up the centre supported by VIII and IX Corps on their flanks. The airborne soldiers, consisting of paratroops and glider-borne troops numbering around 35,000, were dropped at sites where they could capture key bridges and hold the terrain until the land forces arrived. The land forces consisted of ten armoured and motorised brigades with a similar number of soldiers. The land forces advanced from the south along a single road surrounded by flood plain on both sides. The plan anticipated that they would cover the from their start to the bridge across the Rhine in 48 hours. About 100,000 German soldiers were in the vicinity to oppose the allied offensive. It was the largest airborne operation of the war up to that point.

The operation succeeded in capturing the Dutch cities of Eindhoven and Nijmegen along with many towns, and a few V-2 rocket launching sites. It failed in its most important objective: securing the bridge over the Rhine at Arnhem. The Germans slowed and then halted the armoured brigades advancing from the south before they reached the Rhine. The British 1st Airborne Division was unable to secure the bridge and was withdrawn from the north side of the Rhine after suffering 8,000 dead, missing, and captured out of a complement of 10,000 men. When the retreat order came there were not enough boats to get everyone back across the river. The Germans subsequently rounded up most of those left behind, but some of the British and Polish paratroopers managed to avoid capture by the Germans and were sheltered by the Dutch underground until they could be rescued in Operation Pegasus on 22 October 1944. Historians have been critical of the planning and execution of Operation Market Garden. Antony Beevor said that Market Garden &quot;was a bad plan right from the start and right from the top&quot;.

The Germans counterattacked the Nijmegen salient but failed to retake any of the Allied gains. Arnhem was finally captured by the Allies in April 1945, towards the end of the war.

== Geography ==
Highway 69 (later nicknamed &quot;Hell&#x27;s Highway&quot;) leading through the planned route was two narrow lanes, partly raised above a surrounding flat terrain of polder or floodplain. The ground on either side of the highway was in places too soft to support tactical vehicle movement and there were numerous dikes and drainage ditches. Dikes tended to be topped by trees or large bushes, and roads and paths were lined with trees. In early autumn this meant that observation would be seriously restricted.

There were six major water obstacles between the XXX Corps&#x27; jumping-off point and the objective of the north bank of the Lower Rhine River: the Wilhelmina Canal at Son en Breugel wide; the Zuid-Willems Canal at Veghel ; the Maas River at Grave ; the Maas-Waal Canal ; the Waal River at Nijmegen ; and the Rhine at Arnhem . The plan was for airborne forces to seize bridges across all these obstacles nearly simultaneously – any failure to do so would result in delay or defeat. In case bridges were demolished by the Germans, XXX Corps had plans to rebuild them. To this end, a vast quantity of bridging material was collected, along with 2,300 vehicles to carry it and 9,000 engineers to assemble it.

Although the area is generally flat with less than of variation in altitude, Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, commander of XXX Corps, recalled that &quot;The country was wooded and rather marshy, which made any outflanking operation impossible.&quot; Two important hill areas, high, were some of the highest ground in the Netherlands: one northwest of Arnhem and one in the 82nd Airborne Division&#x27;s zone, the Groesbeek ridge. Seizure and defence of this elevated terrain was considered vital to holding the highway bridges.

== Background ==

In August 1944, following the Allied breakout from Normandy and the closure of the Falaise Pocket, the allied armies pursued the retreating German army, expelling it from nearly all of France and Belgium. On 1 September, the Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower took over command of ground forces, while continuing as Supreme Commander. Montgomery resented this change, although the US and UK had agreed to it before the Normandy invasion. He had been the commander of ground forces and the change resulted in his former subordinate, Omar Bradley, becoming his equal. Montgomery continued to command the 21st Army Group, consisting mainly of British and Canadian units.

===Logistics===
By late August the allied armies were running out of petroleum gasoline. Several allied divisions and corps were forced to halt their advance temporarily to replenish supplies. To Eisenhower fell the task of responding to competing demands for fuel and other supplies for the armies under his command. There was no shortage of fuel in the makeshift ports in Normandy; the difficulty lay in transporting sufficient quantities from Normandy to the armies in Belgium and northern France. Most arrived at the front in five gallon jerry cans after being transported hundreds of kilometres by trucks, known as the Red Ball Express, from makeshift ports in Normandy. A potential solution to the logistics problem was to capture a large port more accessible to the advancing allied armies. On 4 September, Montgomery&#x27;s troops did just that, capturing the massive port of Antwerp in Belgium virtually intact, but the Scheldt Estuary leading to it and preventing its use was still under German control. Neither Eisenhower nor Montgomery initially made opening the port of Antwerp a top priority and Antwerp was not used by allied supply ships until 28 November after the Battle of the Scheldt. The allied failure to win access quickly to the port of Antwerp has been called &quot;one of the greatest tactical mistakes of the war&quot;. Winston Churchill later acknowledged that &quot;clearing the Scheldt Estuary and opening the port of Antwerp had been delayed for the sake of the Arnhem thrust. Thereafter it was given first priority.&quot;

===Strategy===

Eisenhower proposed a &quot;broad front strategy&quot; in which the allied armies of Montgomery in Belgium and Bradley further south in France advanced in parallel on a front several hundred miles wide into Germany. Montgomeryand Bradley&#x27;s aggressive subordinate, George S. Pattonboth desired a concentration of forces, a &quot;single thrust&quot; forward into Germany, but each man saw himself as the leader of a single thrust. Montgomery said the allied strategy should be &quot;one powerful full-blooded thrust across the Rhine and into the heart of Germany backed by the whole of the resources of the Allied Armies&quot;. Such a policy would relegate Bradley&#x27;s American armies to a &quot;purely static role&quot;. On his part, Patton said that with 400,000 gallons of gasoline he could be in Germany in two days. War planners saw both men&#x27;s proposals as tactically and logistically infeasible.

While agreeing that Montgomery&#x27;s drive towards the industrial district of the Ruhr in Germany should have priority, Eisenhower still thought it was important to &quot;get Patton moving again&quot;. This strategy was contested by Montgomery, who argued that with the supply situation deteriorating, he would not be able to reach the Ruhr, but &quot;a relocation of our present resources of every description &quot;would&quot; be adequate to get &quot;one&quot; thrust to Berlin&quot;. Montgomery initially suggested &quot;Operation Comet&quot;, a limited airborne &quot;coup de main&quot; operation that was to be launched on 2 September 1944. Comet envisioned using British and Polish airborne forces to capture several bridges en route to the Rhine. However several days of poor weather and Montgomery&#x27;s concerns over increasing levels of German resistance caused him to postpone the operation and then cancel it on 10 September.

Montgomery replaced Comet with Market Garden, a more ambitious plan to bypass the West Wall or Siegfried Line of German defenses by hooking around its northern end and securing a crossing of the Rhine River, thereby gaining a path to the Ruhr. Another factor was the existence of V-2 sites in the Netherlands which were launching rocket strikes on London. On 10 September Dempsey, the British Second Army commander, told Montgomery that he had doubts about this plan. Montgomery replied that he had just received an order from the British government that the V-2 launch sites around The Hague should be neutralised and that the plan must therefore proceed.

That same day, angered by Eisenhower&#x27;s reluctance to give his plan the priority he desired, Montgomery flew to Brussels to meet him. Montgomery tore a file of Eisenhower&#x27;s messages to shreds in front of him, argued for a concentrated northern thrust, and demanded priority in supplies. So fierce and unrestrained was Montgomery&#x27;s language that Eisenhower reached out, patted Montgomery&#x27;s knee, and said, &quot;Steady, Monty! You can&#x27;t talk to me like that. I&#x27;m your boss.&quot;

Eisenhower allegedly told Montgomery why a &quot;single thrust&quot; toward Berlin was not feasible:
What you&#x27;re proposing is this – if I give you all the supplies you want, you could go straight to Berlin – right straight (500 miles) to Berlin? Monty, you&#x27;re nuts. You can&#x27;t do it... If you try a long column like that in a single thrust you&#x27;d have to throw off division after division to protect your flanks from attack.

Nevertheless, Eisenhower consented to Operation Market Garden, giving it &quot;limited priority&quot; in terms of supplies – but only as part of an advance on a broad front. Eisenhower promised that aircraft and trucks would deliver an additional 1,000 tons of supplies daily to Montgomery for Market Garden.

Eisenhower was also under pressure from the United States to use the First Allied Airborne Army as soon as possible. After Normandy, most of the airborne forces had been withdrawn to England, re-forming into the First Allied Airborne Army of two British and three US airborne divisions and the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Eighteen airborne operations had been proposed, then cancelled, when the rapidly moving Allied ground forces overran the intended drop zones. Eisenhower believed that the use of the airborne forces might provide the push needed for the allies to cross the Rhine.

===The plan===

The plan of action consisted of two operations:
* &quot;Market&quot;: airborne forces of Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton&#x27;s First Allied Airborne Army to seize bridges and other terrain, under tactical command of I Airborne Corps under Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning, and
* &quot;Garden&quot;: ground forces of the Second Army to move north spearheaded by XXX Corps under Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks.

==== Market ====

Market would employ four of the six divisions of the First Allied Airborne Army. The U.S. 101st Airborne Division, under Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, would drop in two locations just north of XXX Corps to take the bridges north of Eindhoven at Son and Veghel. The 82nd Airborne Division, under Brigadier General James M. Gavin, would drop northeast of them to take the bridges at Grave and Nijmegen and the British 1st Airborne Division, under Major-General Roy Urquhart, with the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, under Major General Stanisław Sosabowski, attached, would drop at the extreme north end of the route, capturing the road bridge at Arnhem and the rail bridge at Oosterbeek. The 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division would be flown to the captured Deelen Airfield on D+5.

The First Allied Airborne Army had been created on 16 August as the result of British requests for a coordinated headquarters for airborne operations, a concept approved by General Eisenhower on 20 June. The British had strongly hinted that a British officer – Browning in particular – be appointed its commander. Browning for his part decided to bring his entire staff with him on the operation to establish his field HQ using the much-needed 32 Airspeed Horsa gliders for administrative personnel, and six Waco CG-4A gliders for U.S. Signals&#x27; personnel. Since the bulk of both troops and aircraft were American, Brereton, a U.S. Army Air Forces officer, was named by Eisenhower on 16 July and appointed by SHAEF on 2 August. Brereton had no experience in airborne operations but had extensive command experience at the air force level in several theaters, most recently as commander of Ninth Air Force, which gave him a working knowledge of the operations of IX Troop Carrier Command.
Market would be the largest airborne operation in history, delivering over 34,600 men of the 101st, 82nd and 1st Airborne Divisions and the Polish Brigade. 14,589 troops were landed by glider and 20,011 by parachute. Gliders also brought in 1,736 vehicles and 263 artillery pieces. 3,342 tons of ammunition and other supplies were brought by glider and parachute drop.

To deliver its 36 battalions of airborne infantry and their support troops to the continent, the First Allied Airborne Army had under its operational control the 14 groups of IX Troop Carrier Command, and after 11 September the 16 squadrons of 38 Group RAF (an organization of converted bombers providing support to resistance groups) and a transport formation, 46 Group.

The combined force had 1,438 C-47/Dakota transports (1,274 USAAF and 164 RAF) and 321 converted RAF bombers. The Allied glider force had been rebuilt after Normandy until by 16 September it numbered 2,160 CG-4A Waco gliders, 916 Airspeed Horsas (812 RAF and 104 U.S. Army) and 64 General Aircraft Hamilcars (large cargo gliders). The U.S. had only 2,060 glider pilots available, so that none of its gliders would have a co-pilot but would instead carry an extra passenger.

Because the C-47s served as paratrooper transports and glider tugs and because IX Troop Carrier Command would provide all the transports for both British parachute brigades, this massive force could deliver only 60 percent of the ground forces in one lift. This limit was the reason for the decision to split the troop-lift schedule into successive days. Ninety percent of the USAAF transports on the first day would drop parachute troops, with the same proportion towing gliders on the second day (the RAF transports were almost entirely used for glider operations). Brereton rejected having two airlifts on the first day, although this had been accomplished during Operation Dragoon, albeit with slightly more daylight (45 minutes) and against negligible opposition.

17 September was on a dark moon and in the days following it the new moon set before dark. Allied airborne doctrine prohibited big operations in the absence of all light, so the operation would have to be carried out in daylight. The risk of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; interception was judged small, given the crushing air superiority of Allied fighters but there were concerns about the increasing number of flak units in the Netherlands, especially around Arnhem. Brereton&#x27;s experience with tactical air operations judged that flak suppression would be sufficient to permit the troop carriers to operate without prohibitive loss. The invasion of Southern France had demonstrated that large scale daylight airborne operations were feasible. Daylight operations, in contrast to those in Sicily and Normandy, would have much greater navigational accuracy and time-compression of succeeding waves of aircraft, tripling the number of troops that could be delivered per hour. The time required to assemble airborne units on the drop zone after landing would be reduced by two-thirds.

IX Troop Carrier Command&#x27;s transport aircraft had to tow gliders and drop paratroopers, duties that could not be performed simultaneously. Although every division commander requested two drops on the first day, Brereton&#x27;s staff scheduled only one lift based on the need to prepare for the first drop by bombarding German flak positions for half a day and a weather forecast on the afternoon of 16 September (which soon proved erroneous) that the area would have clear conditions for four days, so allowing drops during them.

After one week preparations were declared complete. The planning and training for the airborne drops at Sicily and Normandy had taken months. One United States Air Force historian noted that &#x27;Market&#x27; was the only large airborne operation of the war in which the USAAF &quot;had no training program, no rehearsals, almost no exercises, and a... low level of tactical training.&quot;

Gavin had doubts about the plan. In his diary he wrote, &quot;It looks very rough. If I get through this one I will be very lucky.&quot; He was also highly critical of Browning, writing that he &quot;... unquestionably lacks the standing, influence and judgment that comes from a proper troop experience... his staff was superficial... Why the British units fumble along... becomes more and more apparent. Their tops lack the know-how, never do they get down into the dirt and learn the hard way.&quot;

==== Garden ====

Garden consisted primarily of XXX Corps and was initially spearheaded by the Guards Armoured Division, with the 43rd Wessex and 50th Northumbrian Infantry Divisions in reserve. They were expected to arrive at the south end of the 101st Airborne Division&#x27;s area on the first day, the 82nd&#x27;s by the second day and the 1st&#x27;s by the fourth day at the latest. The airborne divisions would then join XXX Corps in the breakout from the Arnhem bridgehead.

Four days was a long time for an airborne force to fight unsupported. Even so, before Operation Market Garden started it seemed to the Allied high command that the German resistance had broken. Most of the German Fifteenth Army in the area appeared to be fleeing from the Canadians and they were known to have no &quot;Panzergruppen&quot;. It was thought that XXX Corps would face limited resistance on their route up Highway 69 and little armour. Meanwhile, the German defenders would be spread out over trying to contain the pockets of airborne forces, from the Second Army in the south to Arnhem in the north.

=== German preparation ===

The rout of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during July and August led the Allies to believe that the German army was a spent force unable to reconstitute its shattered units. During those two months the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; had suffered a string of defeats with heavy losses. Between 6 June and 14 August it had suffered 23,019 killed in action, 198,616 missing or taken prisoner and 67,240 wounded. Many of the formations the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; had at the beginning of the Normandy campaign had been annihilated or reduced to skeleton formations by the end of August. As the German armies retreated towards the German frontier, they were often harried by air attacks and bombing raids by aircraft of the Allied air forces, inflicting casualties and destroying vehicles. Attempts to halt the Allied advance often seemed fruitless as hurried counter-attacks and blocking positions were brushed aside and at times there seemed to be too few German units to hold anywhere. By early September the situation was beginning to change. Some 65,000 troops of the German Fifteenth Army were extricated from the area with 225 guns and 750 trucks by a flotilla of commandeered freighters, barges and small boats. From there they moved to the Netherlands.

Adolf Hitler began to take a personal interest in the apparent disintegration of Army Group B, which comprised the German armies in northern France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. On 4 September he recalled &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Gerd von Rundstedt, who had been in retirement since Hitler had dismissed him as &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; Commander-in-Chief West on 2 July, and reinstated him in his former command, replacing &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Walter Model, who had taken command just 18 days previously and would henceforth command only Army Group B. Rundstedt immediately began to plan a defence against what Wehrmacht intelligence judged to be 60 Allied divisions at full strength, although Eisenhower possessed only 49 divisions.

Model set out to stop the Allied advance. The German 719th Infantry Division, part of LXXXVIII Corps, was dispatched south to the Albert Canal and Model requested reinforcements from Germany, stating that he would require 25 infantry divisions and six armoured divisions to hold; he envisioned a line stretching from Antwerp via Maastricht to Metz and from there to follow the line of the Albert Canal to the Meuse and the Siegfried Line. Meanwhile, Colonel General Kurt Student, commander of the &quot;Fallschirmjaeger&quot;, the German airborne forces, received orders from Alfred Jodl, Chief of the Operations Staff of the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot;, to immediately move from Berlin and proceed to the Netherlands, where he would collect all available units and build a front near the Albert Canal, which was to be held at all costs. This front was to be held by the new First Parachute Army, a euphemistic name for a paper formation. Its units were scattered throughout Germany and the Netherlands and consisted either of units in the process of being formed or remnants cadred by survivors of previous units.

Though the situation seemed dire, the German front was starting to form into what Robert Kershaw terms &quot;a crust&quot;. Leadership, initiative, and a good staff system were beginning to create an organised push-back out of the initial chaos. On 4 September, the 719th infantry division began to dig in along the Albert Canal and was soon joined by forces under the command of Lieutenant General Kurt Chill. Although Chill only officially commanded the 85th Infantry Division, which had suffered heavy casualties during the retreat from Normandy, he had assumed command of the remnants of the 84th and 89th Infantry Divisions en route. Initially ordered to take his command to the Rhineland for rest and reinforcements, Chill disregarded the order and moved his forces to the Albert Canal, linking up with the 719th; he also had &quot;reception centres&quot; set up at the bridges crossing the Albert Canal, where small groups of retreating troops were picked up and turned into ad hoc units. By 7 September the 176th Infantry Division, a &quot;Kranken&quot; division composed of elderly men and men with various medical complaints, had arrived from the Siegfried Line and elements of the First Parachute Army began to appear. At this stage the Army consisted of approximately seven &quot;Fallschirmjaeger&quot; regiments composed of some 20,000 airborne troops along with a collection of anti-aircraft batteries and a mix of 25 self-propelled guns and tank destroyers. &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and SS units were also allocated to Student&#x27;s command, and Hitler had promised Model that 200 Panther tanks would be sent straight from the production lines; he also ordered all Tiger tanks, &quot;Jagdpanther&quot; self-propelled guns, and 88 mm guns that were available in Germany to be transferred to the West.

On 5 September, Model&#x27;s forces were bolstered by the arrival of the II SS Panzer Corps, which consisted of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions under the command of Lieutenant General Wilhelm Bittrich. The Corps had been reduced to approximately 6,000–7,000 men, 20–30% of its original strength in the course of continuous action since late June including in the Falaise pocket; losses in officers and NCOs had been especially high. Model ordered the two divisions to rest and refit in &quot;safe&quot; areas behind the new German line; these areas coincidentally were to be Eindhoven and Arnhem. The 10th SS Panzer Division was to be restored to full strength in order to provide an armoured reserve and thus the 9th SS Panzer Division was ordered to transfer all of its heavy equipment to its sister division; it was intended that the 9th would then be transported to Germany for replenishment. At the time of Operation Market Garden, the 10th SS Panzer Division had an approximate strength of 3,000 men; an armoured infantry regiment, divisional reconnaissance battalion, two artillery battalions, and an engineer battalion, all partially motorised. However, Bittrich said after the war that he only had five tanks at Arnhem. Other formations were appearing to strengthen the German defences. Between 16 and 17 September, two infantry divisions from Fifteenth Army assembled in Brabant, under strength but well-equipped and able to act as a reserve. Near Eindhoven and Arnhem a number of scratch formations were being assembled. Several SS units, including an NCO training battalion and a &quot;panzergrenadier&quot; reserve battalion, were being prepared to enter combat and Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine personnel were being grouped into &quot;Fliegerhorst&quot; and &quot;Schiffstammabteilung&quot; formations. There were also a number of training battalions that were being equipped, several depot battalions from the Panzer Division &quot;Hermann Göring&quot; and various artillery, anti-aircraft, and field police units scattered throughout the north of the Netherlands.

=== Intelligence ===

==== German ==== 

Rundstedt and Model suspected that a large Allied offensive was imminent, having received many intelligence reports that described a &#x27;constant stream&#x27; of reinforcements to the right wing of the British Second Army. Anthony Blunt is accused of passing information from MI5. The senior intelligence officer of Army Group B believed the Second Army would launch an offensive in the direction of Nijmegen, Arnhem and Wesel with a primary objective of reaching the industrial area along the Ruhr river. He was convinced that airborne troops would be used in this offensive but was unsure where they would be deployed, suspecting areas along the Siegfried Line north of Aachen or possibly even near the Saar. Second Army would assemble its units at the Maas-Scheldt and Albert Canals. The right wing of the Army would be the assault force, composed primarily of armoured units, which would force a crossing of the Maas and attempt to break through to the Ruhr industrial area near Roermond. The left wing would cover the Army&#x27;s northern flank by moving up to the Waal near Nijmegen and isolating the German 15th Army situated on the Dutch coast.

==== Allied ====

A number of reports about German troop movements reached Allied high command, including details of the identity and location of German armoured formations. The UK Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park which monitored and decrypted German radio traffic produced intelligence reports codenamed Ultra. These were sent to senior Allied commanders, but they only reached army headquarters level and were not passed down any lower. Ultra reports revealed the movement of the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions to Nijmegen and Arnhem, creating enough concern for Eisenhower to send his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith, to raise the issue with Montgomery on 10 September. However, Montgomery dismissed Smith&#x27;s concerns and refused to alter the plans for the landing of 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem. Aerial photographs of Arnhem taken by a photo-reconnaissance Spitfire XI from RAF&#x27;s No. 16 Squadron showed tanks in the area. However, most of the original photos have disappeared and this cannot be verified. The only tanks partly visible in the remaining images are probably a Panzer IV and a Panzer III, both of which were unlikely to be from the 9th and 10th SS, who had Tiger I and Panther tanks. There was also information from members of the Dutch resistance that the SS Divisions were in the area, although they didn&#x27;t specify if there were tanks. Fearing that 1st Airborne Division might be in grave danger if it landed at Arnhem the chief intelligence officer of the division, Major Brian Urquhart, arranged a meeting with Browning and informed him of the armour present at Arnhem. Browning dismissed his claims and ordered the division&#x27;s senior medical officer to send Urquhart on sick leave on account of &quot;nervous strain and exhaustion&quot;.
The 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions actually had very few tanks with them. Bittrich, commander of the two divisions, later said that he had almost no tanks left during the Battle of Arnhem as they had mostly been destroyed during the battle at Falaise. In fact, no German tanks were involved in the battle on the first day, and the two which engaged the British on 18 September were destroyed. Field Marshal Walter Model was, coincidently, in Oosterbeek and it was he who ordered all available armoured vehicles to the area. It was this rapid reaction by a high-ranking officer that resulted in large numbers of Axis armour at Arnhem, rather than the presence of the SS Divisions.

== Battle ==

=== Day 1: Sunday, 17 September 1944 ===

==== Early successes ====


Operation Market Garden opened with Allied success all round. In the first landing, almost all troops arrived on top of their drop zones without incident. In the 82nd Airborne Division, 89% of troops landed on or within of their drop zones and 84% of gliders landed on or within of their landing zones. This contrasted with previous operations where night drops had resulted in units being scattered by up to . Losses to enemy aircraft and flak were light; German flak was described in reports as &quot;heavy but inaccurate&quot;. By the end of the first day all water crossings were 100 percent in allied hands, or German troops prevented from using the crossings, except for the large Nijmegen bridge.

In the south, the 101st met little resistance and captured four of five bridges assigned to them. After a brief delay caused by four 88 mm guns and a machine gun post, the bridge at Son was blown up by the Germans on approach. Later that day several small attacks by the German 59th Infantry Division were beaten off. Small units of the 101st moved south of Son, towards Eindhoven. Later that day they made contact with German forces. Elements of the 44th Royal Tank Regiment who were advancing in the VIII Corps sector assisted the 101st.

To their north, the 82nd arrived with a small group dropped near Grave securing the bridge. They also succeeded in capturing one of the vitally important bridges over the Maas-Waal canal, the lock-bridge at Heumen. The 82nd concentrated their efforts to seize the Groesbeek Heights instead of capturing their prime objective, the Nijmegen bridge. The capture of the Groesbeek Heights was to set up a blocking position on the high ground to prevent a German attack out of the nearby Klever Reichswald and to deny the heights to German artillery observers. Browning, the commander of the 1st Airborne Army agreed with the assertions of Gavin, the commander of the 82nd, that Groesbeek Heights were the priority. Gavin wanted to occupy the Grave and the Maas (Meuse)-Waal canal bridges before Nijmegen bridge. He would attempt to seize the Nijmegen bridge only when these were secure, thus releasing troops for Nijmegen.

Before the operation on 15 September Gavin verbally ordered Lt-Col Linquist of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment to send a battalion to the Nijmegen bridge after landing. He had decided that there were enough troops for the other objectives. Linquist later said he understood he should send a battalion after his regiment had completed their earlier assigned targets. Linquist&#x27;s battalion approached the bridge that evening delaying the seizure of the bridge. The battalion was stopped by a SS unit that had driven south from Arnhem. A part of the SS unit returned to Arnhem but found the northern end of the Arnhem bridge occupied by the British 1st Airborne. In an attempt to cross the bridge most of the SS unit was killed, including the commander.

The 508th was tasked with taking the long Nijmegen highway bridge if possible but because of miscommunication they did not start until late in the day. General Gavin&#x27;s orders to Colonel Lindquist of the 508th were to &quot;move without delay&quot; onto the Nijmegen road bridge. Lindquist&#x27;s 508th started jumping at 13:28 with 1,922 men. The jump was perfect with the regiment 90% assembled by 15:00. The commander of 3rd Battalion wrote later that...&quot;we could not have landed better under any circumstances&quot;. The 508th was still sitting around when Gavin asked them at 18:00 if they had got to the bridge yet.

They faced the same disadvantage as the British at Arnhem in dropping many miles from their objective. If they had attacked earlier they would have faced only a dozen German bridge guards. By the time the 508th attacked, troops of the 10th SS Reconnaissance Battalion were arriving. The attack failed, leaving the Nijmegen bridge in German hands.

Capturing this bridge was vital. Unlike some of the bridges to the south which were over smaller rivers and canals that could be bridged by engineering units, the Nijmegen and Arnhem bridges crossed two arms of the Rhine that could not be bridged easily. If either of the Nijmegen or Arnhem bridges were not captured and held, the advance of XXX Corps would be blocked and Operation Market Garden would fail.

==== British landings ====

The 1st Airborne Division landed at 13:30 without serious incident but problems associated with the poor plan began soon after. Only half of the division arrived with the first lift and only half of these (1st Parachute Brigade) could advance on the bridge. The remaining troops had to defend the drop zones overnight for the arrival of the second lift on the following day. Thus the division&#x27;s primary objective had to be tackled by less than half a brigade. While the paratroopers marched eastwards to Arnhem, the Reconnaissance Squadron was to race to the bridge in their jeeps and hold it until the rest of the brigade arrived. The unit set off to the bridge late and having traveled only a short distance the vanguard was halted by a strong German defensive position; the squadron could make no further progress.

This had grave consequences. Five hours after the initial landing, feeling that the British were tied down in Arnhem, the Reconnaissance Battalion of the 9th SS Panzer Division was able to cross the Arnhem bridge and drive to Nijmegen and the bridge over the Waal branch of the Rhine. No British airborne unit was at the bridge.

Arnhem veteran Tom Hicks of 1st Parachute Squadron of the Royal Engineers described the problems the paratroops faced: &quot;They (the Germans) had guns that out-ranged ours. We had no artillery with us so they could just lay off and pick you off kind of thing. If we wanted to get a gun out of action we had to send a patrol out, do it man to man kind of thing.&quot;

Two of the three battalions of the 1st Parachute Brigade were slowed down by small German units of a training battalion which had quickly established a thin blocking line covering the obvious routes into Arnhem. Lieutenant-Colonel John Frost&#x27;s 2nd Parachute Battalion, advancing eastwards along the southernmost road into Arnhem near the Rhine, found its route largely undefended. They arrived at the bridge in the evening and set up defensive positions at the north end. They were joined by Brigade HQ, led by Major Tony Hibbert, which was the brigade&#x27;s only other unit to reach the bridge.

Two attempts to capture the arched steel bridge and its southern approach failed. Of the other battalions, the 3rd Parachute Battalion had covered only half the distance to the bridge when they halted for the night, the rear of their column being under attack and needing time to catch up. The 1st Parachute Battalion was similarly fragmented, yet pushed on around the flank of the German line throughout the night. Frequent skirmishes resulted in their making little more progress. The 3rd Battalion under Captain James Cleminson, KBE, MC, ambushed a German staff car and killed the commander of Arnhem&#x27;s garrison, Major-General Friedrich Kussin, as well as his aide and his driver.

==== Communication breakdown ====

Some loss of communication between the bridge and divisional headquarters in one of the drop zones was expected, because separated them and the main radio was the Type 22 set, with an effective range of . The British radios did not function at any range; some had difficulty receiving signals from just a few hundred metres and others received nothing at all. It was found after landing that the radios had been set to different frequencies, two of which coincided with German and British public broadcasting stations. Other theories have been advanced to explain the greatly reduced range of the 1st Airborne Division radio sets. Thus communication between 1st Airborne units was poor while German defences were being coordinated and reinforced. John Greenacre&#x27;s study points out that radio communications failures were experienced by the division before, were warned about prior to the operation and provided for by bringing extra field telephone wire. The more powerful WS19HP set was used by the 1st Brigade on D+1.

The only means of calling for air support was through two special American units dropped with the 1st Airborne Division. These units were equipped with &quot;Veeps&quot;: jeeps having Very High Frequency SCR-193 crystal sets. It was found impossible to communicate with aircraft on the higher of two frequencies for this and the sets could not be tuned to the lower frequency. Despite efforts to re-tune them, one set was soon destroyed by mortar fire and the other abandoned the next day, cutting the only possible link with RAF fighter-bombers. The pilots were under orders not to attack on their own initiative, since from the air there was no easy way to distinguish friend from foe; together with poor weather, this led to a lack of air support. After the war it was found that the Royal Corps of Signals was either unaware or failed to tell divisional signals of the communication problems identified in November 1943 due to sun spots by the Scientific Advisor&#x27;s Office to the 21st Army Group. Urquhart ordered the aerials to be used, which were useless due to the physics of radio propagation. The wrong frequencies were part of the same problem due to signals personnel not knowing the science of radio communications.

==== XXX Corps advance ====

On the morning of 17 September Horrocks was given confirmation that the operation was to take place that day. At 12:30 hours Horrocks received a signal that the first wave of the airborne forces had left their bases within the United Kingdom and set the time for the ground attack to start at 14:35 hours. At 14:15 hours 300 guns of the Corps artillery opened fire, firing a rolling barrage in front of XXX Corps start line that was wide and in depth. The barrage was supported by seven squadrons of RAF Hawker Typhoons firing rockets at all known German positions along the road to Valkenswaard.
The advance was led by tanks and infantry of the Irish Guards and started on time when Lieutenant Keith Heathcote, commanding the lead tank, ordered his driver to advance. The lead units of the Irish Guards Group had broken out of XXX Corps bridgehead on the Maas-Schelde canal and crossed into the Netherlands by 15:00 hours. After crossing the border the Irish Guards were ambushed by infantry and anti-tank guns dug in on both sides of the main road. Portions of the artillery barrage were refined and fresh waves of Hawker Typhoons were called in. The Guardsmen moved forward to clear the German positions, manned by elements from two German parachute battalions and two battalions of the 9th SS Panzer Division, and soon routed the German forces flanking the road. Interrogation of captured German soldiers led to some of them willingly, others after being threatened, pointing out the remaining German positions. The fighting soon died down and the advance resumed. By last light the town of Valkenswaard had been reached and occupied by the Irish Guards Group.

Horrocks had expected that the Irish Guards would have been able to advance the to Eindhoven within two-three hours; however, they had only covered . The operation was already starting to fall behind schedule. In Valkenswaard engineers were moved up to construct a Class 40 Bailey bridge over a stream, which was completed within 12 hours.

==== German reactions ====
On the German side, it was soon clear what was happening. Model was staying at the Tafelberg Hotel in Oosterbeek, a village to the west of Arnhem, when the British began to land in the countryside to the west of Oosterbeek. He rapidly deduced the likely focus of the attack and after evacuating his headquarters, organised a defense. Bittrich sent a reconnaissance company of the 9th SS Panzer Division to Nijmegen to reinforce the bridge defenses. By midnight, Model had gained a clear picture of the situation and had organised the defense of Arnhem. The confusion usually caused by airborne operations was absent at Arnhem and the advantage of surprise was lost. During the operation, the Germans allegedly recovered a copy of the Market Garden plan from the body of an American officer, who should not have carried it into combat.

=== Day 2: Monday 18 September ===

Allied weather forecasters correctly predicted that England would be covered in fog on the morning of 18 September. The Second Lift was postponed for three hours and thick low clouds began to develop over the southern part of the battle zone, spreading during the day over the area, hampering supply and air support (Seven of the next eight days had poor weather and all air operations were cancelled on 22 and 24 September).

==== 1st Airborne zone ====
The 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions pushed towards the Arnhem bridge during the early hours and had made good progress but they were frequently halted in skirmishes as soon as it became light. With their long and unwieldy columns having to halt to beat off attacks whilst the troops in front carried on unaware, the Germans delayed segments of the two battalions, fragmented them and mopped up the remnants.
Early in the day the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion (sent south the day before) concluded it was not needed in Nijmegen and returned to Arnhem. Though aware of the British troops at the bridge, it attempted to cross by force and was beaten back with heavy losses, including its commanding officer, SS-Hauptsturmführer Viktor Gräbner.

By the end of the day the 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions had entered Arnhem and were within of the bridge with approximately 200 men, one-sixth their original strength. Most of the officers and non-commissioned officers had been killed, wounded or captured. The Second Lift was delayed by fog and jumped onto a landing zone under heavy attack but landed at full strength (the 4th Parachute Brigade consisting of the 10th, 11th and 156th Battalions of the Parachute Regiment, commanded by Brigadier-General John Winthrop Hackett) and C and D Companies of the 2nd South Staffordshire Regiment.

==== 82nd Airborne zone ====

Grave proved to be well defended and German forces continued to press on the 82nd deployed on the Groesbeek heights to the east of Nijmegen. The 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment defended against German attacks in Horst, Grafwegen and Riethorst. Early in the day, German counterattacks seized one of the Allied landing zones where the Second Lift was scheduled to arrive at 13:00. The 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment attacked at 13:10 and cleared the landing zone by 14:00, capturing 16 German Flak pieces and 149 prisoners. Delayed by weather in Britain, the Second Lift did not arrive until 15:30. This lift brought in elements of the 319th and 320th Glider Field Artillery battalions, the 456th Parachute Field Artillery battalion and medical support elements. Twenty minutes later, 135 B-24 bombers dropped supplies from low level.

==== 101st Airborne zone ====
Faced with the loss of the bridge at Son, the 101st unsuccessfully attempted to capture a similar bridge a few kilometres away at Best but found the approach blocked. Other units continued moving to the south and eventually reached the northern end of Eindhoven. At 06:00 hours the Irish Guards Group resumed the advance while facing determined resistance from German infantry and tanks. Around noon the 101st Airborne were met by the lead reconnaissance units from XXX Corps. At 16:00 radio contact alerted the main force that the Son bridge had been destroyed and requested that a Bailey bridge be brought forward. By nightfall, the Guards Armored Division had established itself in the Eindhoven area. However, transport columns were jammed in the packed streets of the town, and they were subjected to German aerial bombardment during the night. XXX Corps engineers, supported by German prisoners of war, constructed a class 40 Bailey bridge within 10 hours across the Wilhelmina Canal. During the day the British VIII and XII Corps, supporting the main attack, had forged bridgeheads across Meuse-Escaut Canal while facing stiff German resistance; the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division was transferred from XXX Corps to VIII Corps so to relieve XXX Corps from having to secure the ground gained thus far. Throughout the day German attacks were launched against XXX Corps and against the newly gained bridgeheads over the Meuse–Escaut Canal, all without success.

=== Day 3: Tuesday 19 September ===

==== Arnhem ====

At 03:00 the commanders of the 2nd Battalion and the 1st and 11th Parachute Battalions met to plan their attack. At 04:30, before dawn, the 1st Parachute Brigade began its attack towards Arnhem Bridge, with the 1st Battalion leading supported by remnants of the 3rd Battalion, with the 2nd South Staffordshires on the 1st Battalion&#x27;s left flank and the 11th Battalion following. As soon as it became light the 1st Battalion was spotted and halted by fire from the main German defensive line. Trapped in open ground and under heavy fire from three sides, the 1st Battalion disintegrated and what remained of the 3rd Battalion fell back. The 2nd South Staffordshires were similarly cut off and, save for about 150 men, overcome by midday. The 11th Battalion, (which had stayed out of much of the fighting) was then overwhelmed in exposed positions while attempting to capture high ground to the north. With no hope of breaking through, the 500 remaining men of these four battalions withdrew westwards in the direction of the main force, away in Oosterbeek.

The 2nd Battalion and attached units (approximately 600 men) were still in control of the northern approach ramp to the Arnhem bridge. They had been ceaselessly bombarded by enemy tanks and artillery from two battle groups led by SS-Sturmbannführer Brinkmann and one commanded by Major Hans-Peter Knaust. The Germans recognised that they would not be moved by infantry attacks such as those that had been bloodily repulsed on the previous day so instead they heavily shelled the short British perimeter with mortars, artillery and tanks; systematically demolishing each house to enable their infantry to exploit gaps and dislodge the defenders. Although in battle against enormous odds, the British clung to their positions and much of the perimeter was held.

==== Oosterbeek ====
To the north of Oosterbeek, the 4th Parachute Brigade led an attempt by the 1st Airborne Division to break through the German lines, but communication difficulties between British paratroopers and General Frederick Browning and the Americans, and enemy resistance, caused the attack to fail with heavy losses. The 1st Airborne Division, scattered far and wide and hard pressed by the enemy on all sides, had lost its offensive capability. Unable to help Lt.-Col. Frost, who commanded the only battalion that had made it to the Arnhem bridge, the remaining soldiers attempted to withdraw into a defensive pocket at Oosterbeek and hold a bridgehead on the north bank of the Rhine after overwhelming German resistance.

At 16:00 hours the British 4th Parachute Brigade&#x27;s withdrawal was supported by the arrival of 35 gliders containing a portion of the 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade and its anti-tank battery, who were deployed in a Landing Zone still controlled by the enemy, which killed all but a small contingent of the reinforcements. While the drop of the remainder of the Polish paratroopers was postponed due to dense fog, its commander General Sosabowski was parachuted into Driel.

==== Nijmegen ====

At 08:20, the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment made contact with the Grenadier Guards of XXX Corps advancing north at Grave. This enabled the regiment to move on to other missions and place the 3rd Battalion in division reserve. XXX Corps were from Arnhem with six hours in hand, &quot;The earlier delays had been made up&quot; Control of all troops now fell to XXX Corps whose prime objective was to seize the Nijmegen bridge having two companies from the Guards Armoured Division assisted by the US 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The attack got within of the bridge before being halted; skirmishing continued throughout the night. A plan was made to attack the south end of the bridge again with support from the 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, who would cross the River Waal in boats downstream of the bridge and then attack the north end. The boats were requested for late afternoon, however they did not arrive as requested.

The 1st and 5th Battalions, Coldstream Guards, were attached to the division. A supply attempt by 35 C-47s (out of 60 sent) was unsuccessful; the supplies were dropped from a high altitude and could not be recovered. Bad weather over English bases prevented the scheduled big glider mission carrying the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment from taking off, ending any hope for the scheduled reinforcements for the 82nd Airborne.

==== Wijchen ====

At 09:50 the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment was going forward to Wijchen, to attack the Edithbridge from its south end. The bridge was secured. After this fierce engagement they pushed on to the traffic bridge south of Wijchen. Another fierce engagement followed and this bridge was secured.

==== Eindhoven–Veghel ====

To their south, units of the 101st sent to take Best the day before, were forced to yield to German counter-attacks during the morning. British tanks arriving during the day helped push back the Germans by late afternoon. Later a small force of Panther tanks arrived at Son and started firing on the Bailey bridge. These too were beaten back by anti-tank guns that had recently landed and the bridge was secured. On the night of 19–20 September, 78 German bombers took off to attack Eindhoven. The Allies had no anti-aircraft guns in the city, allowing the Germans to drop &quot;a clear golden cluster of parachute flares&quot; and bomb Eindhoven without loss. The city centre was shattered and the water pressure failed; over 200 houses were &quot;gutted&quot; and 9,000 buildings were damaged, with over 1,000 civilian casualties, including 227 dead. An ammunition convoy and trucks carrying gasoline were also hit. General Matthew Ridgway, in Eindhoven during the attack, wrote: &quot;Great fires were burning everywhere, ammo trucks were exploding, gasoline trucks were on fire, and debris from wrecked houses clogged the streets.&quot; Elements of the 101st, based in and around the city, witnessed the attack and escaped loss. The 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment rushed into the burning city and rescued civilians during the night. According to Rick Atkinson, this was &quot;the only large, long-range air strike by German bombers during the fall of 1944&quot;.

=== Day 4: Wednesday 20 September ===

==== Arnhem bridge ====

Frost&#x27;s force at the bridge continued to hold and established communication via the public telephone system with 1st Division around noon learning that the division had no hope of relieving them and that XXX Corps was stopped to the south in front of Nijmegen bridge. By the afternoon the British positions around the north end of Arnhem bridge had weakened considerably. Casualties, mostly wounded, were high from constant shelling. An acute lack of ammunition, especially anti-tank munitions, enabled enemy armor to demolish British positions from point-blank range. Food, water and medical supplies were scarce, and so many buildings were on fire and in such serious danger of collapse that a two-hour truce was arranged to evacuate the wounded (including Lieutenant-Colonel Frost) into German captivity. Frederick Gough took over as commander when Frost left. While leading a remnant group in withdrawal from the bridge, toward Oosterbeek, for a joining with the rest of the 1st Division, Major Hibbert was captured.

The Germans overcame pockets of resistance throughout the day, gaining control of the northern bridge approaches and permitting reinforcements to cross the span and reinforce units further south near Nijmegen. The remaining British troops continued to fight on, some with just fighting knives, but by early Thursday morning almost all had been taken prisoner. The last radio message broadcast from the bridge – &quot;Out of ammo, God save the King&quot; – was heard only by German radio intercept operators.

While it was estimated that the 1st Airborne Division, 10,000 strong, would only need to hold the Arnhem bridge for two days, 740 had held it for twice as long against far heavier opposition than anticipated. While 81 British soldiers died defending Arnhem bridge, German losses cannot be stated with any accuracy, though they were high; 11 units known to have participated in the fighting reported 50% casualties after the battle. In memory of the fighting there, the bridge has been renamed the &quot;John Frost Bridge&quot;.

==== Oosterbeek ====

Further west, the remnants of the 1st Airborne Division were gathering at Oosterbeek for their last stand; those already there were not seriously challenged by the enemy that day. To the east of the village, the 1st, 3rd and 11th Parachute Battalions and the 2nd South Staffordshires were organised into a defensive position. In desperate fighting later in the day, they repulsed an enemy attack which threatened to cut the division off from the Rhine and seal the fate of the bridgehead.

In the woods to the west of Oosterbeek the 4th Parachute Brigade fought its way towards the divisional perimeter but was attacked by German troops supported by artillery, mortars and tanks, (some mounting flame-throwers). The brigade had many casualties and the 10th Battalion reached Oosterbeek in the early afternoon with only 60 men.

In the rear, the 156th Parachute Battalion fought off numerous enemy attacks before counter-attacking; the Germans did not know they were fighting men who were in full retreat. The battalion, down to 150 men, mounted a bayonet charge to capture a hollow in the ground in the woods where they were pinned down by enemy attacks for the next eight hours. Towards the end of the day, 75 men fixed bayonets, broke through the German lines and retreated to the Allied pocket at Oosterbeek.

==== Nijmegen ====

The 82nd did not drop on both sides of the Nijmegen bridge: all troops were dropped on the south side of the Waal river. Hence the Americans had no means to seize the bridge, other than by a frontal river crossing from the south. The only boats available were canvas folding boats (normally used only by engineers) from the British XXX Corps stores. These boats, described at the time as &quot;Bailey boats&quot;, did not arrive until the afternoon, and with time running short, a daylight assault crossing was ordered.

At about 15:00 (D+4), the 504th PIR began the river assault, when members of its 3rd Battalion – commanded by Major Julian Cook – were rowed across the Waal, by members of Company &quot;C&quot;, 307th Engineer Battalion (C/307th) in 26 boats. A shortage of paddles required some troopers to paddle the craft with their rifle butts. Despite heavy fire from the German side, about half the boats survived the first crossing and 11 survived the first two crossings. Before the day was over, some boat &quot;crews&quot; from C/307th had crossed the Waal five times, while ferrying across two entire battalions from the 504th. (The costly attack was later nicknamed &quot;Little Omaha&quot; in reference to Omaha Beach. 200 paratroopers were killed, while German losses exceeded 267.) The paratroopers then proceeded through the village of Lent, toward the north end of the bridge. As German forces withdrew from the north end, tanks of the Irish Guards began to cross the bridge from the south, supported by elements of 505th PIR, at 19:30 (D+4). The Irish Guards&#x27; tanks linked up with the 504th PIR north of the bridge, in Lent.

A perception that subsequent advances by XXX Corps were unreasonably slow has remained controversial. Frost and Hibbert&#x27;s forces controlled the Arnhem bridge, away for about another two-and-a-half hours (until about 22:00 that night) and some British resistance in that area continued until the early hours of the following morning. However, it was already dark when the Nijmegen bridge was captured, the overall situation was chaotic, and the depth of German opposition to the north was unknown, to the Allies, and even to German officers on the ground. For instance, the 10th SS Panzer Division commander, Heinz Harmel, when interviewed several decades later by Robert Kershaw (a former British Army officer), stated: &quot;The four panzers (Carrington&#x27;s Grenadier tank troop) who crossed the bridge made a mistake when they stayed in the village of Lent. If they had carried on their advance, it would have been all over for us.&quot; Harmel&#x27;s artillery map, preserved from the time of the battle, suggested that German troops between Nijmegen and Arnhem were extremely thin: there were a handful of security pickets with rifles at the Betuwe midpoint, in Elst. In fact, however, Harmel was evidently unaware that three Tiger tanks, one heavy gun and two companies of infantry had already been heading south from Arnhem towards Lent, when the Irish Guards&#x27; tanks crossed the Nijmegen bridge.

Sgt Peter Robinson, Guards Armoured Division, whose tank led the advance over the Nijmegen road bridge, stated:We reached the far end of the bridge and immediately there was a [German] roadblock. So the troop sergeant covered me through and then I got to the other side and covered the rest of the troop through. We were still being engaged; there was a gun in front of the church three or four hundred yards in front of us. We knocked him out. We got down the road to the railway bridge; we cruised round there very steady. We were being engaged all the time. Initially, four tanks crossed the bridge with a high probability some of the German explosive charges for demolition would activate. British engineers had cut some charges on the south of the bridge. As the tanks moved over the bridge they were fired on by single-shot, disposable anti-tank Panzerfausts, and had grenades dropped on them by German troops in the bridge girders – 180 German bodies were recovered from the girders with some unaccounted falling into the river below. Once across the bridge only a few 82nd troops met the first tanks as they crossed the bridge. After crossing the bridge one tank was destroyed and another badly damaged, yet moving, and was driven to the village of Lent on the north side of the bridge by the only survivor of the attack – a Sgt Knight – who had survived by feigning to be dead. The rest of the crews were killed, injured, or taken prisoner. One tank destroyed a German Sturmgeschütz assault gun lying in wait. The Guards tanks met the bulk of the 82nd troops north of the bridge in the village of Lent, north of the bridge and in darkness, after clearing out SS troops from the village and setting the church ablaze. It was dark by the time (19:30) the Irish Guards tanks linked up with the 504th PIR, north of the Nijmegen bridge. Moreover, on the road out of Lent, on the northern side of the railway bridge, the leading tank met two hidden German anti-tank guns in darkness. Even if the guns were located and destroyed, German troops with Panzerfausts were on the road and four available Guards tanks were low on ammunition. Only one of the four available tanks was a Firefly, mounting a gun capable of destroying a Tiger tank from the front. Three Tiger tanks were heading south to Lent, unbeknownst to the Guards tank crews. Unable to locate the anti-tank guns, the tanks stopped.

In addition, German forces were still threatening to retake the north end of the bridge. Many of the Guards tanks were still assisting the 82nd and XXX Corps infantry in Nijmegen. The Guards who were over the bridge could not leave the northern end of the bridge for fear of recapture. At Lent only five tanks were available, including the damaged tank, which now reportedly had a joint UK-US crew: it included members of the 82nd who had prior experience with Sherman tanks. Carrington&#x27;s tank was stationary, alone, at the northern end of the bridge for 45 minutes, awaiting infantry who were fighting German snipers in the girders as they moved across the bridge. In the meantime, Carrington was attacked by Germans with a Panzerfaust. After clearing the bridge of snipers, the Irish Guards crossed the bridge and formed a defence line. The line was reinforced with 82nd troops.

To the east, German attacks on the Groesbeek Heights made significant progress. A counterattack at Mook by elements of the 505th PIR and 1st Battalion, the Coldstream Guards of XXX Corps forced the Germans back to their line of departure by 20:00. The 508th PIR lost ground at Im Thal and Legewald, when attacked by German infantry and tanks. To the south, running battles between the 101st and various German units continued. Eventually several tanks and self-propelled guns managed to cut the roads but pulled back when low on ammunition.

=== Day 5: Thursday 21 September ===

==== Oosterbeek ====

Approximately 3,584 survivors of the 1st Airborne Division established themselves in the buildings and woods around Oosterbeek with the intention of holding a bridgehead on the north side of the Rhine until XXX Corps could arrive. Throughout the day their position was heavily attacked on all sides. In the southeast, Lonsdale Force (the remnants of the 1st, 3rd, and 11th Parachute Battalions and 2nd South Staffordshires) repulsed a big attack aided by the fire of the divisional light artillery. In the north the 7th King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers were almost overrun during the afternoon but a counterattack with bayonets restored the situation and the heavily depleted battalion moved further south to occupy a narrower front. The most serious attack of the day was made at dawn against &quot;B&quot; Company, 1st Battalion, Border Regiment which controlled a vital area of high ground in the southwestern tip of the perimeter overlooking the Heveadorp ferry crossing at Driel, which was the division&#x27;s only straightforward means of receiving reinforcements from the south. The company was attacked by enemy infantry and armour, including captured French tanks equipped with flamethrowers, and the heights were lost. Counterattacks failed and the remnants of the company were redeployed. The division was left in a precarious position, controlling just of the riverbank. The division held ground to similar attacks elsewhere on their front.

A supply attempt by RAF Stirlings of 38 Group was disrupted by the only Luftwaffe fighter interception during the operation. Fw 190s intercepted the Stirlings at low altitude and shot down 15. Anti-aircraft fire accounted for 8 further losses. The Fw 190s were able to penetrate the screen of Allied fighters sent to cover the drop when the U.S. 56th Fighter Group was late in arriving in its patrol sector between Lochem and Deventer. The 56th redeemed itself to an extent by shooting down 15 of the 22 Fw 190s as they departed.

==== Remainder of Polish paratroopers enter the battle ====
After two days of delay due to the weather, the remainder of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade under Major-General Stanislaw Sosabowski entered the battle on the afternoon of 21 September, delivered at about 17:15 by 114 C-47s of the U.S. 61st and 314th Troop Carrier Groups. Two of the brigade&#x27;s three battalions were dropped amidst heavy German fire, opposite the 1st Airborne Division&#x27;s position on a new drop zone south of the Rhine near the village of Driel. The third battalion was dropped 12–15 miles away near Grave. Overall, the poor coordination by the British air transfer officers and persistent attacks by Luftwaffe aircraft caused their supplies to be dropped away on the opposite side of the Rhine.

Intending to use the Heveadorp ferry to reinforce the division, they discovered that the opposite bank was dominated by the enemy and that the ferry was missing; it was later found downstream past the road bridge, completely unserviceable. Unable to help the British, the Polish withdrew to Driel for the night and organised defence there, with the Rhine behind their backs and German units increasing in strength around them. The brigade had lost 25% of its fighting strength, amounting to 590 casualties. Several attempts to cross the Rhine on improvised equipment were only partly successful due to heavy German fire and an inability by the 1st Airborne to secure the landing area on the Rhine&#x27;s northern bank. The 1st Airborne Division made radio contact during the day with guns of the 64th Medium Regiment of XXX Corps&#x27; artillery, which had advanced with the ground forces and were assigned to the division for support. Unlike many others, this radio link worked throughout the battle and the regiment provided valuable fire support to the division.

==== Nijmegen ====

Despite the capture of Nijmegen bridge and the clearing of the town on the previous evening, the five tanks of Guards Armoured Division which were across the river did not advance due to: darkness, one tank having been hit, meeting hidden German anti-tank guns, not knowing the full situation on the road ahead and having to secure the northern end of the bridge until infantry were fully in place. Unbeknown to the leading tank crews, three Tiger tanks and two companies of infantry were heading down the road south from Arnhem to Lent. The division resumed its advance about 18 hours later, at noon in daylight with reinforcements from Nijmegen.

Horrocks claimed he needed to hold his force as his troops were still fighting in Nijmegen and supplies were slow coming up the single road from Belgium. The Coldstream Guards Group were repulsing an attack on the Groesbeek position, the Irish Guards Group had moved back south to Eindhoven to meet another attack, the Grenadiers had just captured the approaches to the bridge with assistance by the 82nd Airborne paratroops and had five tanks across to support securing the north end of the bridge, and the Welsh Guards were in reserve for the 82nd Airborne. The Guards Armoured Division was scattered over 25 square miles of the south bank of the Waal. Horrocks stated, &quot;Jim Gavin, the divisional commander, could have had no idea of the utter confusion that reigned in Nijmegen at the time, with sporadic battles going on all over the place, and particularly on our one road to the rear where chaos reigned&quot;.

The Market Garden plan depended upon a single highway as the route of advance and supply. This imposed a delay, although the delay was not that great. A problem was that other units could not be deployed on other routes to maintain momentum. Brigadier General Gavin opinioned that this would not have been an issue with firm leadership, although he failed to discuss his own failings in maintaining the set schedule. The historian Max Hastings argued that the delays in moving towards Arnhem &quot;reflected poorly on the British Army&quot;. Carrington stated that he met no one who &quot;suggested we should press on to Arnhem.&quot; The historian Robin Neillands argued that the failure of Gavin&#x27;s 82nd Airborne to take the Nijmegan bridge on 17 September, was a &quot;major contribution to the failure of the entire Arnhem operation and it will not do to pass the blame for that failure on to the British or to Captain Lord Carrington.&quot;

The delay enabled the Germans to reinforce the defence already established at Ressen (an SS infantry battalion, eleven tanks, an infantry battalion, two 88 mm batteries, twenty 20 mm flak and the remnants of the forces fighting at Arnhem), aided by use of the bridge following their capture of its northern end. The advance of the Guards, hindered by marshes that prevented off-road movement, was soon halted by a firm German defensive line. The Guards spearhead did not have the strength to outflank the line. The 43rd Division was ordered to take over the lead, work its way around the enemy positions and make contact with the Polish airborne troops at Driel to the west. The 43rd was away and there was a traffic jam between them and Nijmegen. It was not until the following day, Friday, that the whole division crossed the River Waal and began its advance.

The Germans, clearly starting to gain the upper hand at Arnhem, continued counterattacking all along the path of XXX Corps. XXX Corps still managed to advance with the 101st Airborne Division and XXX Corps holding ground. Glider tugs and cargo carriers delivered supplies to the 82nd Airborne Division. About 60% of the supplies were recovered with 351 of the gliders being counted as effective, partly with the help of Dutch civilians. Most of the 82nd and 101st, reinforced with British armoured units, were engaged in defensive fighting with the objective of holding the highway corridor. Small engagements were fought along the whole length of the corridor.

=== Day 6: Friday 22 September (&quot;Black Friday&quot;) ===

The Germans, wary after unsuccessful and costly attacks the previous day, shelled and mortared the airborne positions heavily. By the end of the battle some 110 guns had been brought to Oosterbeek as the Germans shifted to the tactics that had worked so well at Arnhem bridge. Attacks were limited, conducted against specific positions and even individual houses. Numerous well-sited British anti-tank guns also caused German reluctance to attack. The survivors of the 1st Airborne were outnumbered 4 to 1. The Polish 1st Parachute Brigade at Driel, unable to cross the Rhine, nonetheless forced a redeployment of German forces. Fearing a Polish attempt to recapture Arnhem bridge or, worse, an attempt to cut the road to the south and so trap the 10th SS Panzer Division then blocking the route of the Guards Armoured Division to Arnhem, the Germans withdrew 2,400 troops from Oosterbeek. They were moved south of the river to engage the Polish paratroopers at Driel, making attacks to little effect through the day. 

The British 43rd Wessex Division had moved up in order to relieve the Guards Armoured Division. Elements of the 43rd took Oosterhout from the Germans on 22 September, and then gained Opheusden and Dodewaard the following day but they were unable to push the frontline any further.

==== Link-up between the Poles and XXX Corps ====

The fog lifted as leading elements of the 43rd Division attempted to advance to Driel, exposing them to German fire. Whilst passing the outskirts of Elst at the De Hoop crossroads the 5th Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry came across a column of Tiger I tanks of schwere Panzer-Kompanie &quot;Hummel.&quot; The Cornwalls set up an ambush and succeeded in knocking out five Tigers in a combined use of mines and PIATS. They arrived in Driel during the evening. Lacking assault craft, an unsuccessful attempt was made that night to put elements of the Polish brigade across the river. British and Polish engineers on both sides of the Rhine had worked through the day to improvise a crossing using small boats linked by signals cable but the cable kept breaking forcing the Polish troops to slowly row across against the strong current. The attempt was made under enemy observation and fire and only 52 soldiers of the 8th Polish Parachute Company survived the crossing before a halt was called at dawn. 

While much of the corridor was firmly in Allied hands, German counterattacks were still being mounted along its length. During the previous night, two mixed armoured formations on either side of Highway 69 attacked between Veghel and Grave; one group managed to cut the highway and prevent any further advance to Arnhem. 

=== Day 7: Saturday 23 September ===
The Germans had figured out what the Poles were attempting to do and they spent the rest of the day trying to cut off the British in their northern bridgehead from the riverside. The British managed to hold on and both sides suffered heavy losses. The Germans also attacked the Poles on the south side in order to tie them down but several tanks arrived from XXX Corps and the German attack was defeated. Boats and engineers from the Canadian army also arrived that day and another river crossing that night landed 150 troops of the Polish 3rd Parachute Battalion on the north bank of the Rhine.

To the south several more German attacks from their position astride the road were stopped but the road was still cut. XXX Corps then sent a unit of the Guards Armoured Division south and re-took the road. The rest of the force to the north continued to wait for infantry to move up, still only a few kilometres south of Arnhem.

The 325th GIR was finally delivered to reinforce the 82nd Airborne, originally planned for 19 September, and while it was immediately 75% effective, arrived far too late to affect the battle in that sector.

=== Day 8: Sunday 24 September ===

Another German force cut the road to the south of Veghel and set up defensive positions for the night. It was not clear to the Allies at this point how much of a danger this represented but the principal objective of Operation Market Garden, i.e. the Allied crossing of the Rhine, was abandoned this day and the decision made to go over to the defensive with a new front line in Nijmegen. Nonetheless, an attempt was made on Sunday night to reinforce the 1st Airborne Division with the 4th Battalion, The Dorsetshire Regiment. Two companies were put across the river but the location of the crossing point was ill-advised and the Dorsets landed among German positions. Fragmented by their landing and immediately pinned down, of the 315 men who crossed only 75 reached Oosterbeek; the remainder were taken prisoner. As a result of this failure, it was decided to withdraw the 1st Airborne Division from its bridgehead on the northern side of the Rhine.

=== Day 9: Monday 25 September ===
At dawn the 1st Airborne Division received their orders to withdraw across the Rhine; this was called &quot;Operation Berlin&quot;. This could not be done until nightfall and in the meantime the division struggled to survive. In a departure from their cautious attritional tactics of the previous days, the Germans formed two potent SS battlegroups and made a significant thrust along a narrow front in the eastern sector. This succeeded in breaking through the thin front line and for a time the division was in peril. The attack met with increasing resistance as it pushed deeper into the British lines and was finally broken up by a heavy bombardment of the 64th Medium Regiment.

Employing every ruse to give the Germans the impression that their positions were unchanged, the 1st Airborne Division began its withdrawal at 22:00. British and Canadian engineer units ferried the troops across the Rhine, covered by the Polish 3rd Parachute Battalion on the north bank. By early the next morning they had withdrawn 2,398 survivors, leaving 300 men to surrender on the north bank at first light, when German fire prevented their rescue. Of approximately 10,600 men of the 1st Airborne Division and other units who fought north of the Rhine, 1,485 had died and 6,414 were taken prisoner of whom one third were wounded.

To the south the newly arrived 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division attacked the Germans holding the highway and secured it by the next day. The German bridgehead on the island by this time initially encompassed the villages of Elden, Elst, Huissen and Bemmelthe latter considered the most important. Elst however was lost on 25 September after several days of bitter street fighting with troops from the 43rd Wessex. Meanwhile, the village of Bemmel was captured by the 5th East Yorkshire Regiment on the same day.

=== Further fighting, 26–28 September ===

On 26 September the Germans then crossed the Rhine in battalion strength and managed to gain a small bridgehead at Randwijk. This was only lightly held by 43rd Wessex Reconnaissance troops but on seeing the Germans were soon reinforced by the Hampshires and Somersets with additional support from tanks of the 8th Armoured brigade. Their intention was to take out the dyke road near Randwijk which was used by the Germans to ferry the crossings. Despite the interference from the Luftwaffe, the British were able to force the Germans out after a final gun battle in the village churchthe Hampshires took 150 POWs. The German bridgehead south of the Neder Rijn was effectively destroyed. The following two days saw the 6th and 7th Green Howards attempt to take Baal and Haalderen, two villages both to the northeast and east of Bemmel respectively. This however was a failure. To the south of Haalderen, on the bank of the Waal River, lay a number of brickworks where the tall chimneys were used as German observation points, from where artillery fire could be directed.

From 28 September onwards, the II Fallschirmjäger Korps launched a series of assaults from the Klever Reichswald against the Allied positions east of Nijmegen. These attacks were in preparation for a much larger counter-attack planned by Bittrich. Delays in the preparations of 2nd SS Panzer Korps however meant these were repelled as they weren&#x27;t properly supported by the XII SS Korps, even though they carried out some local diversionary attacks across the Neder-Rijn towards Doorwerth and Wageningenthese too being repulsed.

Hitler ordered the Nijmegen bridges to be destroyed, in the hope that supplies and reinforcements to the Allies would be hampered, and to enable a German counterattack to retake the bridgehead. Various attempts at destroying both bridges proved a costly failure, particularly to the Luftwaffe, who launched many sorties – in one day forty-six fighters were lost to the RAF and anti-aircraft fire. Nevertheless, an attempt by three groups of four German Marine Einsatzkommandos (frogmen) set off from upstream from the Nijmegen bridges to place explosives under them. The frogmen then used the river current in an attempt to return to their lines. The operation was a partial success − the railway bridge was blown up, a span managed to break away from a section and fell into the river, making it totally unusable, but the road bridge was only slightly damaged because the mine had been badly placed. Of the twelve men, three were killed, seven were captured, and two managed to return to their lines. The bridges however were repaired albeit temporarily – Royal Engineers were able to span a prefabricated Bailey bridge both over the railway bridge and the damaged section of the road bridge.

== Casualties ==
XXX Corps suffered fewer than 1,500 casualties, which stands in stark contrast to the 8,000 casualties suffered by the 1st Airborne Division. On several occasions, units of the flanking British Corps made contact with paratroopers before units of XXX Corps, and fought on to support them until the end of the operation. The higher toll by the 101st Airborne Division reflects the reality that in addition to contending with the local German defenders, they also had to combat German troops retreating from the XXX Corps advance.

German casualties are harder to determine, due to incomplete records. Rundstedt provided an official figure of 3,300, but this has been challenged by historians. Conservative estimates range from 6,400 to 8,000 killed and wounded. Kershaw listed the German order of battle, with between 6,315 and 8,925 casualties. In &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, Cornelius Ryan estimated 7,500 to 10,000 additional casualties to those provided by Rundstedt, for a final total of 10,800–13,300 losses. A contemporary paper by the 21st Army Group claimed that 16,000 German prisoners were taken during the course of Operation Market Garden. The report also claimed the destruction of 159 German aircraft, and 30 tanks or self-propelled guns during the operation.

== Honours ==

=== Victoria Cross ===

Five Victoria Crosses were awarded during Operation Market Garden. On 19 September, RAF Douglas Dakota Mk. III, &quot;KG374&quot;, c/n 12383, (ex-USAAF C-47A-DK, &quot;42-92568&quot;), &#x27;YS-DM&#x27;, of 271 Squadron, RAF Down Ampney, Gloucester, piloted by F/Lt. David Lord, was hit by anti-aircraft fire in the starboard engine while on a supply sortie to Arnhem. Fire spread over the starboard wing, as Lord spent ten minutes making two passes over very small drop zones (which, unknown to the crew, had been overrun by German forces) to drop eight ammunition panniers. Just after the last pannier was dropped, the fuel tank exploded and tore off the wing, and only the navigator F/O Harry King escaped. He was made a POW the following morning, spending the rest of the war in Stalag Luft I at Barth, Germany. Lord, the second pilot P/O R. E. H. &quot;Dickie&quot; Medhurst (son of Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Medhurst), the wireless operator F/O Alec Ballantyne, and air dispatchers Cpl. P. Nixon, Dvr. A. Rowbotham, Dvr. J. Ricketts, and Dvr. L. Harper of 223 Company RASC, were killed. Following the release of King from prison camp, full details of the action became known and Lord received a posthumous Victoria Cross (VC) on 13 November 1945, the only VC awarded to any member of Transport Command during the Second World War. In May 1949, the Dutch Government awarded Harry King the Netherlands Bronze Cross.

From 17 to 20 September, John Hollington Grayburn of the 2nd Parachute Battalion &quot;led his men with supreme gallantry and determination. Although in pain and weakened by his wounds, short of food and without sleep, his courage never flagged. There is no doubt that, had it not been for this officer&#x27;s inspiring leadership and personal bravery, the Arnhem bridge could never have been held for this time.&quot; John Grayburn&#x27;s posthumous award of the Victoria Cross was accompanied by his posthumous promotion to captain.

Also on 19 September, Captain Lionel Queripel of the 10th Parachute Battalion, though injured in the face and both arms, personally remained as a solitary rear guard after ordering his men to withdraw, over their protests. He was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

On 20 September, Lance Sergeant John Baskeyfield&#x27;s &quot;superb gallantry [was] beyond praise. During the remaining days at Arnhem stories of his valour were a constant inspiration to all ranks. He spurned danger, ignored pain and, by his supreme fighting spirit, infected all who witnessed his conduct with the same aggressiveness and dogged devotion to duty which characterised his actions throughout.&quot; Sergeant Baskeyfield, a member of the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment, posthumously received his Victoria Cross.

On 25 September, Major Robert Henry Cain, also of the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment, &quot;showed superb gallantry. His powers of endurance and leadership were the admiration of all his fellow officers and stories of his valour were being constantly exchanged amongst the troops. His coolness and courage under incessant fire could not be surpassed.&quot; Major Cain was the only Victoria Cross recipient to survive the battle.

=== Medal of Honor ===

Three American soldiers received the Medal of Honor, posthumously. On 19 September, Private First Class Joe E. Mann of the 101st Airborne Division, under attack and injured in both arms, &quot;which were bandaged to his body... yelled &quot;grenade&quot; and threw his body over the grenade, and as it exploded, he died.&quot;

On 21 September, Private John R. Towle of the 82nd Airborne Division, under attack and &quot;motivated only by his high conception of duty ... rushed approximately 125 yards through grazing enemy fire to an exposed position from which he could engage [an] enemy half-track with his rocket launcher. While in a kneeling position preparatory to firing on the enemy vehicle, Pvt. Towle was mortally wounded by a mortar shell. By his heroic tenacity, at the price of his life, Pvt. Towle saved the lives of many of his comrades and was directly instrumental in breaking up the enemy counterattack.&quot;

On 18 September, Robert G. Cole, commanding the 3rd Battalion of the 502d PIR in Best, Netherlands, got on the radio. A pilot asked him to put some orange identification panels in front of his position. Cole decided to do it himself. For a moment, Cole raised his head, shielding his eyes to see the plane. A German sniper in a farmhouse only 300 yards (270 m) away shot Cole, killing him instantly. Two weeks later, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bayonet charge near Carentan on 11 June. As his widow and two-year-old son looked on, Cole&#x27;s mother accepted his posthumous award on the Fort Sam Houston parade ground where Cole had played as a child.

=== Military Order of William ===

For gallantry during Operation Market Garden, two units received the highest Dutch military award, the Military Order of William. On 8 October 1945, the US 82nd Airborne Division was awarded the Knights 4th class honour by HM Queen Wilhelmina. The division was also allowed to add &quot;Nijmegen 1944&quot; to her battle honors.

On 31 May 2006, HM Queen Beatrix awarded the Knights 4th class honour to the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade.

== Aftermath ==

=== German counter-attack ===


Model attempted to regain the Nijmegen bridgehead in an effort to contain the Allied offensive and drive them off the Betuwe, also known as &#x27;the Island.&#x27; Bittrich led II SS Panzer Korps in the counteroffensive with the aim of retaking Nijmegen and its bridges. British forces now consisted of the 43rd Wessex, the 50th Northumbrian divisions assisted later by the American 101st and backed by XXX Corps artillery. The line held by the Allies was east of the main road Nijmegen–Arnhem, the line ran through Elst, Bemmel and just west of Haalderen down to the Waal River. Commencing on 30 September, the Germans with some armoured support attacked the Allied linesome ground was gained and over the next few days they continued their attacks. By 3 October the Germans had been repelled, suffering heavy losses in the process, including many of the heavy tanks.

British forces from 50th Division then launched a counter-attack on 4 and 5 October, recapturing most of the lost ground, and also capturing the villages of Bemmel and Haalderen, giving extra strength to hold the bridgehead. The 10th SS Division suffered such grievous losses that it was incapable of any offensive action.

The Germans made one final effort, this time against the American 101st, who had relieved the 43rd Wessex around Randwijk, Driel and Opheusden. The 116th Panzer Division were beaten back at Driel and were forced to withdraw on 5 October. The following day, the 363rd Volksgrenadier Division attempted to take Randwijk and Opheusden from the Americans, and a bitter battle was fought for the possession of the latter. Opheusden lay in rubble and soon became a no man&#x27;s land, while the Allies stood firm. The 363rd Division was itself destroyed in the fighting.

On 7 October, Arnhem bridge was finally bombed and destroyed by Martin B-26 Marauders of 344th Bomb Group, USAAF. Now unable to ferry heavy equipment across the river, the Germans were unable to mount any further attacks.

Von Rundstedt gave permission for Model to abandon the Arnhem bridgehead, and thus was reduced to small outposts. In November, the Germans flooded the island.

=== Debate on Allied strategy and tactics ===

Operation Market Garden has remained a controversial battle for several reasons.

Allied tactics and strategy have been much debated. The operation was the result of a strategy debate at the highest levels of Allied command in Europe. Much post-war analysis has thus probed the alternatives that were not taken, such as giving priority to securing the Scheldt estuary and so opening the port of Antwerp. But Montgomery insisted that the First Canadian Army should clear the German garrisons in Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk first although the ports were damaged and would not be navigable for some time. Admiral Cunningham warned that Antwerp would be &quot;as much use as Timbuktu&quot; unless the approaches were cleared, and Admiral Ramsay warned SHAEF and Montgomery that the Germans could block the Scheldt Estuary with ease. The (French) Channel ports were &quot;resolutely defended&quot; and Antwerp was the only solution. But the Germans reinforced their island garrisons, and the Canadians &quot;sustained 12,873 casualties in an operation which could have been achieved at little cost if tackled immediately after the capture of Antwerp. ... This delay was a grave blow to the Allied build-up before winter approached.&quot;

==== Optimistic planning ====

Historian Antony Beevor said in 2021 that &quot;Market Garden was a very bad plan, right from the start.&quot;
Among the controversial aspects of the plan was the necessity that all the main bridges be taken. The terrain was also ill-suited for the mission of XXX Corps. Brereton had ordered that the bridges along XXX Corps&#x27; route should be captured with &quot;thunderclap surprise&quot;.

The decision to drop the 82nd Airborne on the Groesbeek Heights, several kilometres from the Nijmegen Bridge, has been questioned because it resulted in a long delay in its capture. Browning and Gavin considered holding a defensive blocking position on the ridge a prerequisite for holding the highway corridor. Gavin generally favoured accepting the higher initial casualties involved in dropping as close to objectives as possible in the belief that distant drop zones would result in lower chances of success. With the 82nd responsible for holding the centre of the salient, he and Browning decided the ridge must take priority. Combined with the 1st Airborne Division&#x27;s delays within Arnhem, which left the Arnhem bridge open to traffic until 20:00, the Germans were given vital hours to create a defence on the Nijmegen bridge.

At Arnhem, the RAF planners selected the drop zones, refusing to drop near the town on the north side of the target bridge because of flak at Deelen. Another suitable drop zone just to the south of the bridge was rejected because it was thought to be too marshy for landing gliders containing the force&#x27;s heavy equipment. However, that same drop zone was selected for the 1st Polish Brigade in the third lift, which suggests they were well aware of its suitability. Urquhart made his objections to the RAF planners, who were unmoved, even when he informed them that the troops and glider pilots were willing to take whatever risks landing closer to the objectives entailed. Urquhart made the best of the RAF planners&#x27; decision and thus the three main landing and drop zones were from the bridge, with the fourth being away.

==== Weather ====

A precarious timetable at the mercy of the weather resulted in the 101st Airborne Division being without its artillery for two days, the 82nd Airborne without its artillery for a day and without its glider infantry regiment for four days, and the British 1st Airborne Division without its fourth brigade until the fifth day. The more time required to complete the air drops, the longer each division had to devote forces to defending the drop and landing zones, weakening their offensive power.

==== Priority of operation ====

Several weeks prior to the plan taking shape, the British had captured Antwerp and its all-important port facilities. This action had the potential to greatly shorten the Allies&#x27; supply lines and trap Gustav-Adolf von Zangen&#x27;s 15th Army of 80,000 men on the south side of the Scheldt Estuary. Instead, Von Zangen&#x27;s men, with most of their heavy equipment including their artillery, escaped by boat to South Beveland peninsula (Zeeland province, the Netherlands). In September, the peninsula could have been sealed by a short advance of only past Antwerp. Instead, because priority on supplies went to Market Garden, the First Canadian Army paused at Antwerp and then fought the costly Battle of the Scheldt in October. In the aftermath of Market Garden, Antwerp was not made operational until 28 November. By 1 October, over 240 Allied supply ships were waiting, unable to unload their cargo because of the limited port facilities on the continent.

==== Missed opportunities ====

Arnhem bridge was not the only Rhine crossing. Had the Market Garden planners realised that a ferry was available at Driel, the British might have secured that instead of the Arnhem bridge. Being a shorter distance away from their western drop and landing zones, the 1st Parachute Brigade could have concentrated to hold the Oosterbeek heights, instead of one battalion farther away at the road bridge; in this case, Arnhem was &quot;one bridge too many&quot;. A contrasting view is that the attack into Arnhem was intended to capture the rail bridge, the pontoon bridge and the road bridge; that the rail bridge was blown in the face of Frost&#x27;s 2nd Parachute Battalion, the pontoon bridge had been disabled by the removal of several sections and that this left only the highway bridge intact; the Heveadorp ferry was no substitute for a bridge.

Hypothetically, had XXX Corps pushed north, they might have arrived at the south end and secured it (had the Guards Armoured sent more than five Sherman tanks across the bridge at Nijmegen and had they not been later stopped by the German position at Ressen), leaving the way open for another crossing to the north at some other point. There was the smaller possibility of arriving with Frost&#x27;s force intact. This perceived &quot;lack of guts&quot; caused some bitterness at the time among members of both the British 1st Airborne and the U.S. 82nd Airborne. As it was, XXX Corps did not resume the drive to Arnhem that night, but rather eighteen hours later.

The commander of XXX Corps advocated another course of action. About to the west was another bridge at Rhenen, which he predicted would be undefended, because of all the efforts being directed on Oosterbeek. This was true, but the corps was never authorised to take the bridge; if it had, it is almost certain they would have crossed unopposed into the rear of the German lines. By this time, it appears that Montgomery was more concerned with the German assaults on Market Garden&#x27;s lengthy &quot;tail&quot;.

Bad choices were made throughout the operation, and opportunities were ignored. The commander of the Glider Pilot Regiment had asked for a small force with gliders to land on the southern side of the bridge at Arnhem to quickly capture it, but he was denied. This was surprising in light of the fact that in Normandy, the British 6th Airborne Division had used such coup-de-main tactics to take the Pegasus Bridge. In Britain, the commander of the British 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, whose troops were slated to fly into a captured airfield, pleaded with his superiors to allow a brigade to fly in with gliders to assist Major-General Urquhart&#x27;s trapped forces. Browning declined the offer, &quot;as situation better than you think&quot; and reaffirmed his intention to fly the 52nd Division into Deelen airfield as planned. This was probably fortunate, as glider landings on undefended landing zones before the eyes of an alert enemy could have resulted in catastrophe. There was another airfield near Grave and the 52nd Lowland could have been landed there, as the 1st Light Antitank Battery did on 26 September. The Polish 1st Parachute Brigade commander, Sosabowski, was prepared to try a dangerous drop through the fog which held up his deployment but again was refused.

Market Garden was a risky plan that required a willingness to gamble at the tactical and operational levels. Unfortunately, the detailed planning and leadership required at those levels was not always present. The 1st Airborne Division, the least experienced in working as a whole division, was given the most difficult objective. In Beevor&#x27;s view this reflected both the British desire to continue to be seen as an equal partner of the US in the war effort and the fact that US opinion would no longer stand for American troops being placed in the most risky position under British command. As such it represented the triumph of political necessity over the military reality that by this point (unlike in North Africa) US forces were better battlefield performers than the exhausted and overstretched British.

The failure of the 82nd Airborne Division to attach maximum importance to the early capture of Nijmegen Bridge was a major mistake. XXX Corps was also criticised for its inability to keep to the operation&#x27;s timetable. The most notable example of this was on Wednesday 20 September, when the Nijmegen Bridge had finally been captured and elements of the Guards Armoured Division, after crossing, promptly came to a halt for the night to rest, refuel, and rearm. XXX Corps was delayed at Son by a bridge demolition, and again at Nijmegen (having arrived by D+3, within the maximum time estimate, having compensated for the delay to build a Bailey Bridge at Son). The lead unit of XXX Corps, the Guards Armoured Division, was led by a commander (Allan Adair) whom Montgomery had sought to remove prior to D-Day. This action was blocked due to Adair&#x27;s popularity. Gavin regretted giving his division&#x27;s most important tasks (Groesbeek ridge and Nijmegen) to the 508th PIR rather than his best regiment, Tucker&#x27;s 504th PIR.

==== Intelligence failure ====

Unlike the American airborne divisions in the area, British forces at Arnhem ignored the local Dutch resistance. There was a reason for this: Britain&#x27;s spy network in the Netherlands had been thoroughly and infamously compromised – the so-called &quot;England game&quot;, which had only been discovered in April 1944, therefore British intelligence took pains to minimise all civilian contact. U.S. units, without this bad experience, made use of Dutch help. As things turned out, knowledge of the Driel ferry or of the underground&#x27;s secret telephone network could have changed the result of the operation, especially since Allied radio equipment failed, having to rely on messengers. The latter would have given the XXX Corps and Airborne High Command knowledge about the dire situation at Arnhem.

After the war, claims arose that the Dutch resistance had indeed been penetrated. One high-ranking Dutch officer who had worked in counter-intelligence at SHAEF, Lieutenant-Colonel Oreste Pinto, published a popular book, &quot;Spy Catcher&quot;, part-memoir and part counter-intelligence handbook. Pinto, who had made a name for himself in World War I for his part in uncovering Mata Hari, claimed that a minor figure in the Dutch resistance, Christiaan Lindemans (nicknamed &quot;King Kong&quot;) had been a German agent and had betrayed Operation Market Garden to the Germans. Lindemans was arrested in October 1944, but committed suicide in his cell in 1946, while awaiting trial. In 1969, the French journalist and historian Anne Laurens concluded that Lindemans had been a double agent.

==== Tributes to the participants ==== 
Eisenhower wrote to Urquhart: &quot;In this war there has been no single performance by any unit that has more greatly inspired me or more highly excited my admiration, than the nine days action of your division between 17 and 26 September&quot;.

Montgomery predicted that &quot;in years to come it will be a great thing for a man to be able to say: &#x27;I fought at Arnhem&#x27;.&quot;

CBS war correspondent Bill Downs, who was assigned to Montgomery&#x27;s campaign since the Normandy invasion, famously said of Nijmegen that it was &quot;...a single, isolated battle that ranks in magnificence and courage with Guam, Tarawa, Omaha Beach...a story that should be told to the blowing of bugles and the beating of drums for the men whose bravery made the capture of this crossing over the Waal River possible.&quot;

=== Debate on outcome ===

==== Contemporaneous ====

Both Churchill and Montgomery claimed that the operation was nearly or 90% successful, although in Montgomery&#x27;s equivocal acceptance of responsibility for failure he blames lack of support, and also refers to the Battle of the Scheldt which was undertaken by Canadian troops not involved in Market Garden.

Churchill claimed in a telegram to Jan Smuts on 9 October that

In 1948, Eisenhower wrote that &quot;The attack began well and unquestionably would have been successful except for the intervention of bad weather.&quot; Eisenhower was isolated in the SHAEF HQ at Granville, which did not even have radio or telephone links, so his staff were largely ignorant of the details of the operation. Bedell Smith&#x27;s objections were brushed aside by Montgomery, as were those of Montgomery&#x27;s chief of staff Freddie de Guingand who went to England on sick leave.

Responsibility for the failure &quot;began with Eisenhower and extended to Montgomery, Brereton, Browning, and, on the ground side, Dempsey and Horrocks, neither of whom ... galvanised their tank units while there was still time to have seized and held Arnhem bridge&quot;. D&#x27;Este notes that Montgomery&#x27;s admission of a mistake was unique: &quot;the only admission of failure by a senior Allied commander&quot;.

Montgomery claimed that Market Garden was &quot;90% successful&quot; and said:

One notable Dutch reaction was:

==== Later assessments ====

The post-war American official history of the campaign, written by Charles MacDonald, stated that the operation &quot;accomplished much of what it had been designed to accomplish. Nevertheless, by the merciless logic of war, Market Garden was a failure.&quot; The operation failed to establish a bridgehead across the Neder Rijn (Lower Rhine) river and turn the northern flank of the West Wall. MacDonald stated that a salient deep had been created in the German lines. This salient created a constant threat of an Allied breakout to the north and proved advantageous when the 21st Army Group launched subsequent operations. While a collapse of the German military in the Netherlands was not a formal objective of the operation, MacDonald wrote that &quot;few would deny that many Allied commanders had nurtured the hope&quot; but the operation also failed to realise this. The British official history of the campaign noted that the operation failed, but won &quot;a valuable salient and a bridgehead over the Waal.&quot; The official history conceded that these &quot;had no immediate effect on the Allies advance into Germany.&quot; The German official history stated that &quot;In terms of the Allies&#x27; original objectives, the operation was a total failure&quot;; it failed to cut-off German forces in the Netherlands, failed to flank to the West Wall, and ended any possibility that the war could end before the end of the year. The reasons for these failures are stated to have primarily been poor terrain, bad weather conditions, and faulty intelligence. However, the history conceded that the German counter-objectives (&quot;to hem in the Allied troops south of the Lower Rhine and to destroy them there&quot;) were likewise not met.

Rick Atkinson wrote that while &quot;one-fifth of the Netherlands had been liberated ... the rest would endure another nine months of occupation&quot;, which resulted in 16,000 civilian deaths. Atkinson stated that the terrain captured &quot;led nowhere&quot;, and that the operation failed to achieve its objectives due to &quot;an epic cock-up [of] poor plan[ing] with deficient intelligence, haphazard execution, and indifferent generalship&quot;. Carlo D&#x27;Este wrote &quot;What had begun with high optimism had turned into a military disaster&quot;, and that despite the heroics at Arnhem bridge, the operation &quot;failed to establish a bridgehead north of the Rhine&quot;. D&#x27;Este argued that this resulted in a stalemate through winter, which saw lengthy attritional battles that obtained little significant territory and caused high casualties.

David Fraser wrote that Market Garden was a strategic failure. Stephen Ashley Hart stated that the operation was &quot;partly unsuccessful&quot;, and that Montgomery &quot;immediately reconstituted the Second (British) Army so that it could launch Operation Gatwick, an eastward thrust intended to reach the Rhine near Krefeld&quot;. This second attempt was cancelled due to the &quot;precarious state of the ... salient and the failure to clear the flank-threatening enemy salient at Venlo&quot;. Michael Reynolds wrote that &quot;With the war still in progress, it was inevitable that Market Garden would be presented to the British and American people as a victory.&quot;, but stated &quot;In reality, it was a strategic failure&quot; that failed to obtain the desired objectives. Reynolds stated &quot;The salient achieved led nowhere and was to prove extremely costly in the coming months&quot;, and that &quot;The seven [British commanders] most directly involved ... bear responsibility for the failure of the Operation. It is also clear that, whilst the German commanders were prepared to take all necessary measures and risk to win the battle, even to point of using men untrained in ground warfare, their British adversaries were [not]&quot;.

Milton Shulman wrote that the &quot;airborne operation had achieved some useful results&quot; by driving a wedge into the German position and &quot;thereby isolating the Fifteenth Army north of Antwerp from the First Parachute Army on the eastern side of the bulge. This segregation from the rest of the German front complicated the supply problem of Fifteenth Army, which was forced to rely on the inferior crossings over the Maas and the Waal rivers west of the Allied penetration.&quot; Shulman stated that the terrain captured &quot;served as an important base for subsequent operations against the Germans on the Rhine&quot;, ensured the Allied forces maintained the initiative, forced the Germans to remain on the defensive and ensured they could not assemble enough forces for a counterattack towards Antwerp, and stated that German Fifteenth Army commander called the loss of bridges and terrain as &quot;a great embarrassment to us&quot;.

Chester Wilmot stated that the captured terrain was &quot;of immense tactical value&quot;, which removed &quot;the threat of an immediate counter-stroke against Antwerp; strategically, however, it was in danger of becoming a blind alley, unless the bridgeheads over the Maas and the Waal could be quickly exploited.&quot; However, Wilmot noted that the operation failed to achieve its actual objectives, and that Montgomery&#x27;s claim of a 90 per cent success &quot;is difficult to support, unless the success of the operation is judged merely in terms of the number of bridges captured.&quot; Citing the commander of the First Parachute Army, Wilmot stated that the weather was the main contributing factor to the failure of the operation. John Warren wrote that &quot;the greatest airborne operation of the war&quot; had &quot;ended in failure&quot;, which had seen &quot;all objectives save Arnhem ... won, but without Arnhem the rest were as nothing.&quot; Gerhard Weinberg wrote &quot;At the end of ten days of bitter fighting ... the attempt to &#x27;bounce&#x27; the [Rhine] had failed by a narrow margin in the face of reviving Germany resistance&quot;.

=== Subsequent combat in the Netherlands ===

After Operation Market Garden failed to establish a bridgehead across the Rhine, Allied forces launched offensives on three fronts in the south of the Netherlands. To secure shipping to the vital port of Antwerp they advanced northwards and westwards, the Canadian First Army taking the Scheldt Estuary in the Battle of the Scheldt. Allied forces also advanced eastwards in Operation Aintree to secure the banks of the Meuse as a natural boundary for the established salient. This attack on the German bridgehead west of the Meuse near Venlo was for the Allies an unexpectedly protracted affair, which included the Battle of Overloon. After &quot;Aintree&quot;&#x27;s completion Operation Pheasant was launched on 20 October which saw the Market Garden salient expand westward and resulted in the liberation of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

In February 1945, Allied forces in Operation Veritable advanced from the Groesbeek heights which had been taken during Market Garden, and into Germany, crossing the Rhine in March during Operation Plunder. As a result of Operation Plunder, the city of Arnhem was finally liberated by I Canadian Corps on 14 April 1945 after two days of fighting. A surrender of the remaining German forces in the west of the Netherlands was signed on 5 May.

==== Famine in the Netherlands ====
A tragic consequence of the operation&#x27;s failure was the Dutch famine of 1944–45, also known as the &#x27;Hunger Winter&#x27;. During the battle Dutch railway workers, incited by the Dutch government in London, went on strike in order to aid the Allied assault. In retribution Germany forbade food transportation, and in the following winter more than twenty thousand Dutch citizens starved to death.

=== Memorials and remembrance ===


The prized Arnhem bridge for which the British had fought so hard did not survive the war. As the front line stabilised south of the Rhine, B-26 Marauders of 344th Bomb Group, USAAF destroyed it on 7 October to deny its use to the Germans. It was replaced with a bridge of similar appearance in 1948 and renamed John Frost Bridge (John Frostbrug) on 17 December 1977.

There are a number of monuments in the EindhovenNijmegenArnhem corridor. A memorial near Arnhem reads:

Several museums in the Netherlands are dedicated to Operation Market Garden, including the Freedom Museum in Groesbeek, Wings of Liberation Museum Park in Best (near Eindhoven) and Airborne Museum Hartenstein in Oosterbeek. Annually there is a commemorative walk in Oosterbeek on the first Saturday of September which attracts tens of thousands of participants.

On 16 September 1994, 101st Airborne veterans unveiled a &quot;Monument for the Dutch&quot; in Sint-Oedenrode. The monument is a gift from the veterans to the civilians who fought alongside of the U.S. troops, much to the surprise and relief of the U.S. soldiers. The inscription on the monument is in English and reads &quot;Dedicated to the people of the Corridor by the veterans of the 101st Airborne Division, in grateful appreciation of their courage, compassion and friendship&quot;.

The &quot;Airborne trail&quot; () was created as a permanent reminder of Operation Market Garden by the Dutch hiking association, (OLAT) (&#x27;Hiking Sports Club of the Long-Distance Walkers of Olland&#x27;). It is a , long-distance pedestrian hiking trail that follows as closely as possible the path of the liberating forces, from Lommel to Arnhem. It was officially opened in September 2004, during the festivities marking the 60th anniversary of the Liberation.

A Commemorative Project plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2009, to commemorate the unique military and historical ties between Canada and the Netherlands. A hole, a par five, on the south course (Hylands Golf Course Uplands) in Ottawa, Ontario was named &quot;Arnhem, in honour of the Royal Canadian Artillery squadrons that took part in Second World War allied airborne Operation from 17 to 26 September 1944. The operation, intended to secure a series of bridges so the allies could advance into Germany, fell short when the allied forces were unsuccessful in securing the bridge over the Rhine at Arnhem.&quot;

The village of Somerby in Leicestershire has a memorial hall dedicated to the men of the 10th battalion who were based there and who did not return. Each year there is a parade in their honour led by the Seaforth Highlanders.

<text>In complex dynamics, the Julia set and the [[Julia set|Fatou set]] are two complementary sets (Julia &quot;laces&quot; and Fatou &quot;dusts&quot;) defined from a function. Informally, the Fatou set of the function consists of values with the property that all nearby values behave similarly under repeated iteration of the function, and the Julia set consists of values such that an arbitrarily small perturbation can cause drastic changes in the sequence of iterated function values.
Thus the behavior of the function on the Fatou set is &quot;regular&quot;, while on the Julia set its behavior is &quot;chaotic&quot;.

The Julia set of a function    is commonly denoted formula_1 and the Fatou set is denoted formula_2 These sets are named after the French mathematicians Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou whose work began the study of complex dynamics during the early 20th century.

==Formal definition==
Let formula_3 be a non-constant meromorphic function from the Riemann sphere onto itself. Such functions formula_3 are precisely the non-constant complex rational functions, that is, formula_5 where formula_6 and formula_7 are complex polynomials. Assume that &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; have no common roots, and at least one has degree larger than 1. Then there is a finite number of open sets formula_8 that are left invariant by formula_3 and are such that:
# The union of the sets formula_10 is dense in the plane and
# formula_3 behaves in a regular and equal way on each of the sets formula_10.

The last statement means that the termini of the sequences of iterations generated by the points of formula_10 are either precisely the same set, which is then a finite cycle, or they are finite cycles of circular or annular shaped sets that are lying concentrically. In the first case the cycle is &quot;attracting&quot;, in the second case it is &quot;neutral&quot;.

These sets formula_10 are the Fatou domains of formula_3, and their union is the Fatou set formula_16 of formula_3. Each of the Fatou domains contains at least one critical point of formula_3, that is, a (finite) point &quot;z&quot; satisfying formula_19, or formula_20 if the degree of the numerator formula_21 is at least two larger than the degree of the denominator formula_7, or if formula_23 for some &quot;c&quot; and a rational function formula_24 satisfying this condition.

The complement of formula_16 is the Julia set formula_26 of formula_3. If all the critical points are preperiodic, that is they are not periodic but eventually land on a periodic cycle, then formula_26 is all the sphere. Otherwise, formula_26 is a nowhere dense set (it is without interior points) and an uncountable set (of the same cardinality as the real numbers). Like formula_16, formula_26 is left invariant by formula_3, and on this set the iteration is repelling, meaning that formula_33 for all &quot;w&quot; in a neighbourhood of &quot;z&quot; (within formula_26). This means that formula_3 behaves chaotically on the Julia set. Although there are points in the Julia set whose sequence of iterations is finite, there are only a countable number of such points (and they make up an infinitesimal part of the Julia set). The sequences generated by points outside this set behave chaotically, a phenomenon called &quot;deterministic chaos&quot;.

There has been extensive research on the Fatou set and Julia set of iterated rational functions, known as rational maps. For example, it is known that the Fatou set of a rational map has either 0, 1, 2 or infinitely many components. Each component of the Fatou set of a rational map can be classified into one of four different classes.

==Equivalent descriptions of the Julia set==
* formula_26 is the smallest closed set containing at least three points which is completely invariant under &quot;f&quot;.
* formula_26 is the closure of the set of repelling periodic points.
* For all but at most two points formula_38 the Julia set is the set of limit points of the full backwards orbit formula_39 (This suggests a simple algorithm for plotting Julia sets, see below.)
* If &quot;f&quot; is an entire function, then formula_26 is the boundary of the set of points which converge to infinity under iteration.
* If &quot;f&quot; is a polynomial, then formula_26 is the boundary of the filled Julia set; that is, those points whose orbits under iterations of &quot;f&quot; remain bounded.

==Properties of the Julia set and Fatou set==
The Julia set and the Fatou set of &quot;f&quot; are both completely invariant under iterations of the holomorphic function &quot;f&quot;:
: formula_42
: formula_43

==Examples==
For formula_44 the Julia set is the unit circle and on this the iteration is given by doubling of angles (an operation that is chaotic on the points whose argument is not a rational fraction of formula_45). There are two Fatou domains: the interior and the exterior of the circle, with iteration towards 0 and ∞, respectively.

For formula_46 the Julia set is the line segment between −2 and 2. There is one Fatou domain: the points not on the line segment iterate towards ∞. (Apart from a shift and scaling of the domain, this iteration is equivalent to formula_47 on the unit interval, which is commonly used as an example of chaotic system.)

The functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are of the form formula_48, where &quot;c&quot; is a complex number. For such an iteration the Julia set is not in general a simple curve, but is a fractal, and for some values of &quot;c&quot; it can take surprising shapes. See the pictures below.
For some functions &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) we can say beforehand that the Julia set is a fractal and not a simple curve. This is because of the following result on the iterations of a rational function:

This means that each point of the Julia set is a point of accumulation for each of the Fatou domains. Therefore, if there are more than two Fatou domains, &quot;each&quot; point of the Julia set must have points of more than two different open sets infinitely close, and this means that the Julia set cannot be a simple curve. This phenomenon happens, for instance, when &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is the Newton iteration for solving the equation formula_49:

:formula_50

The image on the right shows the case &quot;n&quot; = 3.

==Quadratic polynomials==

A very popular complex dynamical system is given by the family of complex quadratic polynomials, a special case of rational maps. Such quadratic polynomials can be expressed as 
: formula_51
where &quot;c&quot; is a complex parameter. Fix some formula_52 large enough that formula_53 (For example, if is in the Mandelbrot set, then formula_54 so we may simply let formula_55) Then the filled Julia set for this system is the subset of the complex plane given by
: formula_56
where formula_57 is the &quot;n&quot;th iterate of formula_58 The Julia set formula_59 of this function is the boundary of formula_60.
The parameter plane of quadratic polynomials – that is, the plane of possible &quot;c&quot; values – gives rise to the famous Mandelbrot set. Indeed, the Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of all &quot;c&quot; such that formula_59 is connected. For parameters outside the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set is a Cantor space: in this case it is sometimes referred to as Fatou dust.

In many cases, the Julia set of &quot;c&quot; looks like the Mandelbrot set in sufficiently small neighborhoods of &quot;c&quot;. This is true, in particular, for so-called Misiurewicz parameters, i.e. parameters &quot;c&quot; for which the critical point is pre-periodic. For instance:
* At &quot;c&quot; = &quot;i&quot;, the shorter, front toe of the forefoot, the Julia set looks like a branched lightning bolt.
* At &quot;c&quot; = −2, the tip of the long spiky tail, the Julia set is a straight line segment.

In other words, the Julia sets formula_59 are locally similar around Misiurewicz points.

==Generalizations==
The definition of Julia and Fatou sets easily carries over to the case of certain maps whose image contains their domain; most notably transcendental meromorphic functions and Adam Epstein&#x27;s finite-type maps.

Julia sets are also commonly defined in the study of dynamics in several complex variables.

== Pseudocode ==
The below pseudocode implementations hard code the functions for each fractal. Consider implementing complex number operations to allow for more dynamic and reusable code.

 xtmp = (zx * zx + zy * zy) ^ (n / 2) * cos(n * atan2(zy, zx)) + cx;
 zy = (zx * zx + zy * zy) ^ (n / 2) * sin(n * atan2(zy, zx)) + cy;
 zx = xtmp;
 iteration = iteration + 1;
 if (iteration == max_iteration)
 return black;
 else
 return iteration;


Another recommended option is to reduce color banding between iterations by using a renormalization formula for the iteration. 

Such formula is given to be,
:formula_65
:formula_66

where formula_67 is the escaping iteration, bounded by some formula_68 such that formula_69 and formula_70, and formula_71 is the magnitude of the last iterate before escaping.

This can be implemented, very simply, like so:

# simply replace the last 4 lines of code from the last example with these lines of code:

if(iteration == max_iteration)
 return black;
else 
 abs_z = zx * zx + zy * zy;
 return iteration + 1 - log(log(abs_z))/log(n);

The difference is shown below with a Julia set defined as formula_72 where formula_73.

==The potential function and the real iteration number==
The Julia set for formula_44 is the unit circle, and on the outer Fatou domain, the &quot;potential function&quot; &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is defined by &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = log|&quot;z&quot;|. The equipotential lines for this function are concentric circles. As formula_75 we have

:formula_76

where formula_77 is the sequence of iteration generated by &quot;z&quot;. For the more general iteration formula_63, it has been proved that if the Julia set is connected (that is, if &quot;c&quot; belongs to the (usual) Mandelbrot set), then there exist a biholomorphic map &quot;ψ&quot; between the outer Fatou domain and the outer of the unit circle such that formula_79. This means that the potential function on the outer Fatou domain defined by this correspondence is given by:

:formula_80

This formula has meaning also if the Julia set is not connected, so that we for all &quot;c&quot; can define the potential function on the Fatou domain containing ∞ by this formula. For a general rational function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) such that ∞ is a critical point and a fixed point, that is, such that the degree &quot;m&quot; of the numerator is at least two larger than the degree &quot;n&quot; of the denominator, we define the &quot;potential function&quot; on the Fatou domain containing ∞ by:

:formula_81

where &quot;d&quot; = &quot;m&quot; − &quot;n&quot; is the degree of the rational function.

If &quot;N&quot; is a very large number (e.g. 10100), and if &quot;k&quot; is the first iteration number such that formula_82, we have that

:formula_83

for some real number formula_84, which should be regarded as the real iteration number, and we have that:

:formula_85

where the last number is in the interval [0, 1).

For iteration towards a finite attracting cycle of order &quot;r&quot;, we have that if formula_86 is a point of the cycle, then formula_87 (the &quot;r&quot;-fold composition), and the number

:formula_88

is the &quot;attraction&quot; of the cycle. If &quot;w&quot; is a point very near formula_86 and &quot;w&quot;′ is &quot;w&quot; iterated &quot;r&quot; times, we have that

:formula_90

Therefore, the number formula_91 is almost independent of &quot;k&quot;. We define the potential function on the Fatou domain by:

:formula_92

If ε is a very small number and &quot;k&quot; is the first iteration number such that formula_93, we have that

:formula_94

for some real number formula_84, which should be regarded as the real iteration number, and we have that:

:formula_96

If the attraction is ∞, meaning that the cycle is &quot;super-attracting&quot;, meaning again that one of the points of the cycle is a critical point, we must replace &quot;α&quot; by

:formula_97

where &quot;w&quot;′ is &quot;w&quot; iterated &quot;r&quot; times and the formula for &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) by:

:formula_98

And now the real iteration number is given by:

:formula_99

For the colouring we must have a cyclic scale of colours (constructed mathematically, for instance) and containing &quot;H&quot; colours numbered from 0 to &quot;H&quot;−1 (&quot;H&quot; = 500, for instance). We multiply the real number formula_84 by a fixed real number determining the density of the colours in the picture, and take the integral part of this number modulo &quot;H&quot;.

The definition of the potential function and our way of colouring presuppose that the cycle is attracting, that is, not neutral. If the cycle is neutral, we cannot colour the Fatou domain in a natural way. As the terminus of the iteration is a revolving movement, we can, for instance, colour by the minimum distance from the cycle left fixed by the iteration.

==Field lines==
In each Fatou domain (that is not neutral) there are two systems of lines orthogonal to each other: the &quot;equipotential lines&quot; (for the potential function or the real iteration number) and the &quot;field lines&quot;.

If we colour the Fatou domain according to the iteration number (and &quot;not&quot; the real iteration number formula_84, as defined in the previous section), the bands of iteration show the course of the equipotential lines. If the iteration is towards ∞ (as is the case with the outer Fatou domain for the usual iteration formula_102), we can easily show the course of the field lines, namely by altering the colour according as the last point in the sequence of iteration is above or below the &quot;x&quot;-axis (first picture), but in this case (more precisely: when the Fatou domain is super-attracting) we cannot draw the field lines coherently - at least not by the method we describe here. In this case a field line is also called an external ray.

Let &quot;z&quot; be a point in the attracting Fatou domain. If we iterate &quot;z&quot; a large number of times, the terminus of the sequence of iteration is a finite cycle &quot;C&quot;, and the Fatou domain is (by definition) the set of points whose sequence of iteration converges towards &quot;C&quot;. The field lines issue from the points of &quot;C&quot; and from the (infinite number of) points that iterate &quot;into&quot; a point of &quot;C&quot;. And they end on the Julia set in points that are non-chaotic (that is, generating a finite cycle). Let &quot;r&quot; be the order of the cycle &quot;C&quot; (its number of points) and let formula_86 be a point in &quot;C&quot;. We have formula_104 (the r-fold composition), and we define the complex number α by

:formula_105

If the points of &quot;C&quot; are formula_106, α is the product of the &quot;r&quot; numbers formula_107. The real number 1/|α| is the &quot;attraction&quot; of the cycle, and our assumption that the cycle is neither neutral nor super-attracting, means that . The point formula_86 is a fixed point for formula_109, and near this point the map formula_109 has (in connection with field lines) character of a rotation with the argument β of α (that is, formula_111).

In order to colour the Fatou domain, we have chosen a small number ε and set the sequences of iteration formula_112 to stop when formula_93, and we colour the point &quot;z&quot; according to the number &quot;k&quot; (or the real iteration number, if we prefer a smooth colouring). If we choose a direction from formula_86 given by an angle &quot;θ&quot;, the field line issuing from formula_86 in this direction consists of the points &quot;z&quot; such that the argument &quot;ψ&quot; of the number formula_116 satisfies the condition that

:formula_117

For if we pass an iteration band in the direction of the field lines (and away from the cycle), the iteration number &quot;k&quot; is increased by 1 and the number ψ is increased by β, therefore the number formula_118 is constant along the field line.

A colouring of the field lines of the Fatou domain means that we colour the spaces between pairs of field lines: we choose a number of regularly situated directions issuing from formula_86, and in each of these directions we choose two directions around this direction. As it can happen that the two field lines of a pair do not end in the same point of the Julia set, our coloured field lines can ramify (endlessly) in their way towards the Julia set. We can colour on the basis of the distance to the center line of the field line, and we can mix this colouring with the usual colouring. Such pictures can be very decorative (second picture).

A coloured field line (the domain between two field lines) is divided up by the iteration bands, and such a part can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the unit square: the one coordinate is (calculated from) the distance from one of the bounding field lines, the other is (calculated from) the distance from the inner of the bounding iteration bands (this number is the non-integral part of the real iteration number). Therefore, we can put pictures into the field lines (third picture).

== Plotting the Julia set ==

Methods : 
* Distance Estimation Method for Julia set (DEM/J)
* Inverse Iteration Method (IIM)

===Using backwards (inverse) iteration (IIM) ===
 
As mentioned above, the Julia set can be found as the set of limit points of the set of pre-images of (essentially) any given point. So we can try to plot the Julia set of a given function as follows. Start with any point &quot;z&quot; we know to be in the Julia set, such as a repelling periodic point, and compute all pre-images of &quot;z&quot; under some high iterate formula_120 of &quot;f&quot;.

Unfortunately, as the number of iterated pre-images grows exponentially, this is not feasible computationally. However, we can adjust this method, in a similar way as the &quot;random game&quot; method for iterated function systems. That is, in each step, we choose at random one of the inverse images of &quot;f&quot;.

For example, for the quadratic polynomial &quot;fc&quot;, the backwards iteration is described by

:formula_121

At each step, one of the two square roots is selected at random.

Note that certain parts of the Julia set are quite difficult to access with the reverse Julia algorithm. For this reason, one must modify IIM/J ( it is called MIIM/J) or use other methods to produce better images.

===Using DEM/J===
As a Julia set is infinitely thin we cannot draw it effectively by backwards iteration from the pixels. It will appear fragmented because of the impracticality of examining infinitely many startpoints. Since the iteration count changes vigorously near the Julia set, a partial solution is to imply the outline of the set from the nearest color contours, but the set will tend to look muddy.

A better way to draw the Julia set in black and white is to estimate the distance of pixels (DEM) from the set and to color every pixel whose center is close to the set. The formula for the distance estimation is derived from the formula for the potential function &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;z&quot;). When the equipotential lines for &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) lie close, the number formula_122 is large, and conversely, therefore the equipotential lines for the function formula_123 should lie approximately regularly. It has been proven that the value found by this formula (up to a constant factor) converges towards the true distance for z converging towards the Julia set.

We assume that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is rational, that is, formula_5 where &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and &quot;q&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) are complex polynomials of degrees &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, respectively, and we have to find the derivative of the above expressions for &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;z&quot;). And as it is only formula_77 that varies, we must calculate the derivative formula_126 of formula_77 with respect to &quot;z&quot;. But as formula_128 (the &quot;k&quot;-fold composition), formula_126 is the product of the numbers formula_130, and this sequence can be calculated recursively by formula_131, starting with formula_132 (&quot;before&quot; the calculation of the next iteration formula_133).

For iteration towards ∞ (more precisely when , so that ∞ is a super-attracting fixed point), we have

:formula_134

() and consequently:

:formula_135

For iteration towards a finite attracting cycle (that is not super-attracting) containing the point and having order &quot;r&quot;, we have

:formula_136

and consequently:

:formula_137

For a super-attracting cycle, the formula is:

:formula_138

We calculate this number when the iteration stops. Note that the distance estimation is independent of the attraction of the cycle. This means that it has meaning for transcendental functions of &quot;degree infinity&quot; (e.g. sin(&quot;z&quot;) and tan(&quot;z&quot;)).

Besides drawing of the boundary, the distance function can be introduced as a 3rd dimension to create a solid fractal landscape.

<doc id="56435" wikidata="Q12174" url="?curid=56435" title="Obesity">
<text>Obesity is a medical condition, considered by multiple organizations to be a disease, in which excess body fat has accumulated to such an extent that it can potentially have negative effects on health. People are classified as obese when their body mass index (BMI)—a person&#x27;s weight divided by the square of the person&#x27;s height—is over ; the range is defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values to calculate obesity. Obesity is a major cause of disability and is correlated with various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis.
Obesity has individual, socioeconomic, and environmental causes. Some known causes are diet, low physical activity, automation, urbanization, genetic susceptibility, medications, mental disorders, economic policies, endocrine disorders, and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
While many people living with obesity attempt to lose weight and are often successful, maintaining weight loss long-term is rare. Obesity prevention requires a complex approach, including interventions at medical, societal, community, family, and individual levels. Changes to diet as well as exercising are the main treatments recommended by health professionals. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat or sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. The World Health Organization stresses that the disease is a societal responsibility and that these dietary choices should be made the most available, affordable, and accessible options. Medications can be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading to feeling full earlier, or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Many do not realize that metabolic surgery is not only about reducing intake, it has also been shown to alter gut hormones for a period of time. 
Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2022, over 1 billion people lived with obesity worldwide (879 million adults and 159 million children), representing more than a double of adult cases (and four times higher than cases among children) registered in 1990. Obesity is more common in women than in men. Today, obesity is stigmatized in most of the world. Conversely, some cultures, past and present, have a favorable view of obesity, seeing it as a symbol of wealth and fertility. The World Health Organization, the US, Canada, Japan, Portugal, Germany, the European Parliament and medical societies, e.g. the American Medical Association, classify obesity as a disease. Others, such as the UK, do not.

==Classification==

Obesity is typically defined as a substantial accumulation of body fat that could impact health. Medical organizations tend to classify people living with obesity as based on body mass index (BMI) – a ratio of a person&#x27;s weight in kilograms to the square of their height in meters. For adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines &quot;overweight&quot; as a BMI 25 or higher, and &quot;obesity&quot; as a BMI 30 or higher. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) further subdivides obesity based on BMI, with a BMI 30 to 35 called class 1 obesity; 35 to 40, class 2 obesity; and 40+, class 3 obesity.

For children, obesity measures take age into consideration along with height and weight. For children aged 5–19, the WHO defines obesity as a BMI two standard deviations above the median for their age (a BMI around 18 for a five-year old; around 30 for a 19-year old). For children under five, the WHO defines obesity as a weight three standard deviations above the median for their height.

Some modifications to the WHO definitions have been made by particular organizations. The surgical literature breaks down class II and III or only class III obesity into further categories whose exact values are still disputed.
* Any BMI ≥ 35 or 40 kg/m2 is &quot;severe obesity&quot;.
* A BMI of ≥ 35 kg/m2 and experiencing obesity-related health conditions or ≥ 40 or 45 kg/m2 is &quot;morbid obesity&quot;.
* A BMI of ≥ 45 or 50 kg/m2 is &quot;super obesity&quot;.

As Asian populations develop negative health consequences at a lower BMI than Caucasians, some nations have redefined obesity; Japan has defined obesity as any BMI greater than 25 kg/m2 while China uses a BMI of greater than 28 kg/m2.

The preferred obesity metric in scholarly circles is the body fat percentage (BF%) – the ratio of the total weight of person&#x27;s fat to his or her body weight, and BMI is viewed merely as a way to approximate BF%. According to &quot;American Society of Bariatric Physicians&quot;, levels in excess of 32% for women and 25% for men are generally considered to indicate obesity.

BMI is now viewed as outdated in numerous countries. It ignores variations between individuals in amounts of lean body mass, particularly muscle mass. Individuals involved in heavy physical labor or sports may have high BMI values despite having little fat. For example, more than half of all NFL players are classified as &quot;obese&quot; (BMI ≥ 30), and 1 in 4 are classified as &quot;extremely obese&quot; (BMI ≥ 35), according to the BMI metric. However, their mean body fat percentage, 14%, is well within what is considered a healthy range. Similarly, Sumo wrestlers may be categorized by BMI as &quot;severely obese&quot; or &quot;very severely obese&quot; but many Sumo wrestlers are not categorized as obese when body fat percentage is used instead (having &lt;25% body fat). Some Sumo wrestlers were found to have no more body fat than a non-Sumo comparison group, with high BMI values resulting from their high amounts of lean body mass.

Canada utilises BMI sparingly within their method of defining levels of obesity through use of the Edmonton Scale (for adult obesity). This scale also introduces factors such as Quality of Life, Mental Health &amp; Mobility amongst others. In recent years, Canada chose to allow both Chile &amp; Ireland to adapt their obesity guidelines to suit both countries&#x27; health systems. In Ireland, obesity is now defined as &quot;a Complex, Chronic &amp; Relapsing Disease&quot;.

==Effects on health==

Obesity increases a person&#x27;s risk of developing various metabolic diseases, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer disease, depression, and certain types of cancer. Depending on the degree of obesity and the presence of comorbid disorders, obesity is associated with an estimated 2–20 year shorter life expectancy. High BMI is a marker of risk for, but not a direct cause of, diseases caused by diet and physical activity.

===Mortality===
Obesity is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide. The mortality risk is lowest at a BMI of 20–25 kg/m2 in non-smokers and at 24–27 kg/m2 in current smokers, with risk increasing along with changes in either direction. This appears to apply in at least four continents. Other research suggests that the association of BMI and waist circumference with mortality is U- or J-shaped, while the association between waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio with mortality is more positive. In Asians the risk of negative health effects begins to increase between 22 and 25 kg/m2. In 2021, the World Health Organization estimated that obesity caused at least 2.8 million deaths annually. On average, obesity reduces life expectancy by six to seven years, a BMI of 30–35 kg/m2 reduces life expectancy by two to four years, while severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) reduces life expectancy by ten years.

===Morbidity===
Obesity increases the risk of many physical and mental conditions. These comorbidities are most commonly shown in metabolic syndrome, a combination of medical disorders which includes: diabetes mellitus type 2, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and high triglyceride levels. A study from the RAK Hospital found that obese people are at a greater risk of developing long COVID. The CDC has found that obesity is the single strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.

Complications are either directly caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing a common cause such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle. The strength of the link between obesity and specific conditions varies. One of the strongest is the link with type 2 diabetes. Excess body fat underlies 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women.

Health consequences fall into two broad categories: those attributable to the effects of increased fat mass (such as osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, social stigmatization) and those due to the increased number of fat cells (diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). Increases in body fat alter the body&#x27;s response to insulin, potentially leading to insulin resistance. Increased fat also creates a proinflammatory state, and a prothrombotic state.

==== Metrics of health ====
Newer research has focused on methods of identifying healthier obese people by clinicians, and not treating obese people as a monolithic group. Obese people who do not experience medical complications from their obesity are sometimes called &quot;(metabolically) healthy obese&quot;, but the extent to which this group exists (especially among older people) is in dispute. The number of people considered &quot;metabolically healthy&quot; depends on the definition used, and there is no universally accepted definition. There are numerous obese people who have relatively few metabolic abnormalities, and a minority of obese people have no medical complications. The guidelines of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists call for physicians to use risk stratification with obese patients when considering how to assess their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

In 2014, the BioSHaRE–EU Healthy Obese Project (sponsored by Maelstrom Research, a team under the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre) came up with two definitions for &quot;healthy obesity&quot;, one more strict and one less so:
To come up with these criteria, BioSHaRE controlled for age and tobacco use, researching how both may effect the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity, but not found to exist in the metabolically healthy obese. Other definitions of metabolically healthy obesity exist, including ones based on waist circumference rather than BMI, which is unreliable in certain individuals.

Another identification metric for health in obese people is calf strength, which is positively correlated with physical fitness in obese people. Body composition in general is hypothesized to help explain the existence of metabolically healthy obesity—the metabolically healthy obese are often found to have low amounts of ectopic fat (fat stored in tissues other than adipose tissue) despite having overall fat mass equivalent in weight to obese people with metabolic syndrome.

===Survival paradox===

Although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available research evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox. The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis and has subsequently been found in those with heart failure and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

In people with heart failure, those with a BMI between 30.0 and 34.9 had lower mortality than those with a normal weight. This has been attributed to the fact that people often lose weight as they become progressively more ill. Similar findings have been made in other types of heart disease. People with class I obesity and heart disease do not have greater rates of further heart problems than people of normal weight who also have heart disease. In people with greater degrees of obesity, however, the risk of further cardiovascular events is increased. Even after cardiac bypass surgery, no increase in mortality is seen in the overweight and obese. One study found that the improved survival could be explained by the more aggressive treatment obese people receive after a cardiac event. Another study found that if one takes into account chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in those with PAD, the benefit of obesity no longer exists.

==Causes==
The &quot;a calorie is a calorie&quot; model of obesity posits a combination of excessive food energy intake and a lack of physical activity as the cause of most cases of obesity. A limited number of cases are due primarily to genetics, medical reasons, or psychiatric illness. The satiety value shows that the feeling of satiety per calorie varies between food types. Increasing rates of obesity at a societal level are felt to be due to an easily accessible and palatable diet, increased reliance on cars, and mechanized manufacturing.

Some other factors have been proposed as causes towards rising rates of obesity worldwide, including insufficient sleep, endocrine disruptors, increased usage of certain medications (such as atypical antipsychotics), increases in ambient temperature, decreased rates of smoking, demographic changes, increasing maternal age of first-time mothers, changes to epigenetic dysregulation from the environment, increased phenotypic variance via assortative mating, social pressure to diet, among others. According to one study, factors like these may play as big of a role as excessive food energy intake and a lack of physical activity; however, the relative magnitudes of the effects of any proposed cause of obesity is varied and uncertain, as there is a general need for randomized controlled trials on humans before definitive statement can be made.

According to the Endocrine Society, there is &quot;growing evidence suggesting that obesity is a disorder of the energy homeostasis system, rather than simply arising from the passive accumulation of excess weight&quot;.

===Diet===


1961

2001–03

Map of dietary energy availability per person per day in 1961 (left) and 2001–2003 (right) Calories per person per day (kilojoules per person per day)








Excess appetite for palatable, high-calorie food (especially fat, sugar, and certain animal proteins) is seen as the primary factor driving obesity worldwide, likely because of imbalances in neurotransmitters affecting the drive to eat. Dietary energy supply per capita varies markedly between different regions and countries. It has also changed significantly over time. From the early 1970s to the late 1990s the average food energy available per person per day (the amount of food bought) increased in all parts of the world except Eastern Europe. The United States had the highest availability with per person in 1996. This increased further in 2003 to . During the late 1990s, Europeans had per person, in the developing areas of Asia there were per person, and in sub-Saharan Africa people had per person. Total food energy consumption has been found to be related to obesity.

The widespread availability of dietary guidelines has done little to address the problems of overeating and poor dietary choice. From 1971 to 2000, obesity rates in the United States increased from 14.5% to 30.9%. During the same period, an increase occurred in the average amount of food energy consumed. For women, the average increase was per day ( in 1971 and in 2004), while for men the average increase was per day ( in 1971 and in 2004). Most of this extra food energy came from an increase in carbohydrate consumption rather than fat consumption. The primary sources of these extra carbohydrates are sweetened beverages, which now account for almost 25 percent of daily food energy in young adults in America, and potato chips. Consumption of sweetened beverages such as soft drinks, fruit drinks, and iced tea is believed to be contributing to the rising rates of obesity and to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency is related to diseases associated with obesity.

As societies become increasingly reliant on energy-dense, big-portions, and fast-food meals, the association between fast-food consumption and obesity becomes more concerning. In the United States, consumption of fast-food meals tripled and food energy intake from these meals quadrupled between 1977 and 1995.

Agricultural policy and techniques in the United States and Europe have led to lower food prices. In the United States, subsidization of corn, soy, wheat, and rice through the U.S. farm bill has made the main sources of processed food cheap compared to fruits and vegetables. Calorie count laws and nutrition facts labels attempt to steer people toward making healthier food choices, including awareness of how much food energy is being consumed.

Obese people consistently under-report their food consumption as compared to people of normal weight. This is supported both by tests of people carried out in a calorimeter room and by direct observation.

===Sedentary lifestyle===

A sedentary lifestyle may play a significant role in obesity. Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work, and currently at least 30% of the world&#x27;s population gets insufficient exercise. This is primarily due to increasing use of mechanized transportation and a greater prevalence of labor-saving technology in the home. In children, there appear to be declines in levels of physical activity (with particularly strong declines in the amount of walking and physical education), likely due to safety concerns, changes in social interaction (such as fewer relationships with neighborhood children), and inadequate urban design (such as too few public spaces for safe physical activity). World trends in active leisure time physical activity are less clear. The World Health Organization indicates people worldwide are taking up less active recreational pursuits, while research from Finland found an increase and research from the United States found leisure-time physical activity has not changed significantly. Physical activity in children may not be a significant contributor.

In both children and adults, there is an association between television viewing time and the risk of obesity. Increased media exposure increases the rate of childhood obesity, with rates increasing proportionally to time spent watching television.

===Genetics===

Like many other medical conditions, obesity is the result of an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Polymorphisms in various genes controlling appetite and metabolism predispose to obesity when sufficient food energy is present. As of 2006, more than 41 of these sites on the human genome have been linked to the development of obesity when a favorable environment is present. People with two copies of the FTO gene (fat mass and obesity associated gene) have been found on average to weigh 3–4 kg more and have a 1.67-fold greater risk of obesity compared with those without the risk allele. The differences in BMI between people that are due to genetics varies depending on the population examined from 6% to 85%.

Obesity is a major feature in several syndromes, such as Prader–Willi syndrome, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, Cohen syndrome, and MOMO syndrome. (The term &quot;non-syndromic obesity&quot; is sometimes used to exclude these conditions.) In people with early-onset severe obesity (defined by an onset before 10 years of age and body mass index over three standard deviations above normal), 7% harbor a single point DNA mutation.

Studies that have focused on inheritance patterns rather than on specific genes have found that 80% of the offspring of two obese parents were also obese, in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight. Different people exposed to the same environment have different risks of obesity due to their underlying genetics.

The thrifty gene hypothesis postulates that, due to dietary scarcity during human evolution, people are prone to obesity. Their ability to take advantage of rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater adipose reserves would be more likely to survive famine. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies. This theory has received various criticisms, and other evolutionarily-based theories such as the drifty gene hypothesis and the thrifty phenotype hypothesis have also been proposed.

===Other illnesses===
Certain physical and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) as well as some congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and some eating disorders such as binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders. Obesity and depression influence each other mutually, with obesity increasing the risk of clinical depression, and also depression leading to a higher chance of developing obesity.

=== Drug-induced obesity ===
Certain medications may cause weight gain or changes in body composition; these include insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, steroids, certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin and valproate), pizotifen, and some forms of hormonal contraception.

===Social determinants===


While genetic influences are important to understanding obesity, they cannot completely explain the dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally. Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to increases in body weight on an individual basis, the cause of the shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated. There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors.

The correlation between social class and BMI varies globally. Research in 1989 found that in developed countries women of a high social class were less likely to be obese. No significant differences were seen among men of different social classes. In the developing world, women, men, and children from high social classes had greater rates of obesity. In 2007 repeating the same research found the same relationships, but they were weaker. The decrease in strength of correlation was felt to be due to the effects of globalization. Among developed countries, levels of adult obesity, and percentage of teenage children who are overweight, are correlated with income inequality. A similar relationship is seen among US states: more adults, even in higher social classes, are obese in more unequal states.

Many explanations have been put forth for associations between BMI and social class. It is thought that in developed countries, the wealthy are able to afford more nutritious food, they are under greater social pressure to remain slim, and have more opportunities along with greater expectations for physical fitness. In undeveloped countries the ability to afford food, high energy expenditure with physical labor, and cultural values favoring a larger body size are believed to contribute to the observed patterns. Attitudes toward body weight held by people in one&#x27;s life may also play a role in obesity. A correlation in BMI changes over time has been found among friends, siblings, and spouses. Stress and perceived low social status appear to increase risk of obesity.

Smoking has a significant effect on an individual&#x27;s weight. Those who quit smoking gain an average of 4.4 kilograms (9.7 lb) for men and 5.0 kilograms (11.0 lb) for women over ten years. However, changing rates of smoking have had little effect on the overall rates of obesity.

In the United States, the number of children a person has is related to their risk of obesity. A woman&#x27;s risk increases by 7% per child, while a man&#x27;s risk increases by 4% per child. This could be partly explained by the fact that having dependent children decreases physical activity in Western parents.

In the developing world urbanization is playing a role in increasing rate of obesity. In China overall rates of obesity are below 5%; however, in some cities rates of obesity are greater than 20%. In part, this may be because of urban design issues (such as inadequate public spaces for physical activity). Time spent in motor vehicles, as opposed to active transportation options such as cycling or walking, is correlated with increased risk of obesity.

Malnutrition in early life is believed to play a role in the rising rates of obesity in the developing world. Endocrine changes that occur during periods of malnutrition may promote the storage of fat once more food energy becomes available.

===Gut bacteria===

The study of the effect of infectious agents on metabolism is still in its early stages. Gut flora has been shown to differ between lean and obese people. There is an indication that gut flora can affect the metabolic potential. This apparent alteration is believed to confer a greater capacity to harvest energy contributing to obesity. Whether these differences are the direct cause or the result of obesity has yet to be determined unequivocally. The use of antibiotics among children has also been associated with obesity later in life.

An association between viruses and obesity has been found in humans and several different animal species. The amount that these associations may have contributed to the rising rate of obesity is yet to be determined.

=== Other factors ===
Not getting enough sleep is also associated with obesity. Whether one causes the other is unclear. Even if short sleep does increase weight gain, it is unclear if this is to a meaningful degree or if increasing sleep would be of benefit.

Some have proposed that chemical compounds called &quot;obesogens&quot; may play a role in obesity.

Certain aspects of personality are associated with being obese. Loneliness, neuroticism, impulsivity, and sensitivity to reward are more common in people who are obese while conscientiousness and self-control are less common in people who are obese. Because most of the studies on this topic are questionnaire-based, it is possible that these findings overestimate the relationships between personality and obesity: people who are obese might be aware of the social stigma of obesity and their questionnaire responses might be biased accordingly. Similarly, the personalities of people who are obese as children might be influenced by obesity stigma, rather than these personality factors acting as risk factors for obesity.

In relation to globalization, it is known that trade liberalization is linked to obesity; research, based on data from 175 countries during 1975–2016, showed that obesity prevalence was positively correlated with trade openness, and the correlation was stronger in developing countries.

==Pathophysiology==

Two distinct but related processes are considered to be involved in the development of obesity: sustained positive energy balance (energy intake exceeding energy expenditure) and the resetting of the body weight &quot;set point&quot; at an increased value. The second process explains why finding effective obesity treatments has been difficult. While the underlying biology of this process still remains uncertain, research is beginning to clarify the mechanisms.

At a biological level, there are many possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of obesity. This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman&#x27;s laboratory. While leptin and ghrelin are produced peripherally, they control appetite through their actions on the central nervous system. In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the melanocortin pathway being the most well understood. The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain&#x27;s feeding and satiety centers, respectively.

The arcuate nucleus contains two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated in part by leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.

==Management==
The main treatment for obesity consists of weight loss via lifestyle interventions, including prescribed diets and physical exercise. Although it is unclear what diets might support long-term weight loss, and although the effectiveness of low-calorie diets is debated, lifestyle changes that reduce calorie consumption or increase physical exercise over the long term also tend to produce some sustained weight loss, despite slow weight regain over time.

Although 87% of participants in the National Weight Control Registry were able to maintain 10% body weight loss for 10 years, the most appropriate dietary approach for long term weight loss maintenance is still unknown. In the US, intensive behavioral interventions combining both dietary changes and exercise are recommended. Intermittent fasting has no additional benefit of weight loss compared to continuous energy restriction. Adherence is a more important factor in weight loss success than whatever kind of diet an individual undertakes.

Several hypo-caloric diets are effective. In the short-term low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term, however, all types of low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. Heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar.

Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may lower the risk of heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.

=== Health policy ===
Obesity is a complex public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. As such, managing it requires changes in the wider societal context and effort by communities, local authorities, and governments. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts have been made to increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes.

Mass media campaigns seem to have limited effectiveness in changing behaviors that influence obesity, but may increase knowledge and awareness regarding physical activity and diet, which might lead to changes in the long term. Campaigns might also be able to reduce the amount of time spent sitting or lying down and positively affect the intention to be active physically. Nutritional labelling with energy information on menus might be able to help reducing energy intake while dining in restaurants. Some call for policy against ultra-processed foods.

==Medical interventions==

=== Medication ===

Since the introduction of medicines for the management of obesity in the 1930s, many compounds have been tried. Most of them reduce body weight by small amounts, and several of them are no longer marketed for obesity because of their side effects. Out of 25 anti-obesity medications withdrawn from the market between 1964 and 2009, 23 acted by altering the functions of chemical neurotransmitters in the brain. The most common side effects of these drugs that led to withdrawals were mental disturbances, cardiac side effects, and drug abuse or drug dependence. Deaths were reportedly associated with seven products.

Five medications beneficial for long-term use are: orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss after one year ranged from 3.0 to 6.7 kg (6.6-14.8 lbs) over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, phentermine–topiramate is available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected lorcaserin and phentermine-topiramate, in part because of associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Lorcaserin was available in the United States and then removed from the market in 2020 due to its association with cancer. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death; however, liraglutide, when used for type 2 diabetes, does reduce cardiovascular events.

In 2019 a systematic review compared the effects on weight of various doses of fluoxetine (60 mg/d, 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d, 10 mg/d) in obese adults. When compared to placebo, all dosages of fluoxetine appeared to contribute to weight loss but lead to increased risk of experiencing side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea during period of treatment. However, these conclusions were from low certainty evidence. When comparing, in the same review, the effects of fluoxetine on weight of obese adults, to other anti-obesity agents, omega-3 gel and not receiving a treatment, the authors could not reach conclusive results due to poor quality of evidence.

Among antipsychotic drugs for treating schizophrenia clozapine is the most effective, but it also has the highest risk of causing the metabolic syndrome, of which obesity is the main feature. For people who gain weight because of clozapine, taking metformin may reportedly improve three of the five components of the metabolic syndrome: waist circumference, fasting glucose, and fasting triglycerides.

=== Surgery ===
The most effective treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion. Surgery for severe obesity is associated with long-term weight loss, improvement in obesity-related conditions, and decreased overall mortality; however, improved metabolic health results from the weight loss, not the surgery. One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending on the type of procedure performed) at 10 years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures. Complications occur in about 17% of cases and reoperation is needed in 7% of cases.

==Epidemiology==

In earlier historical periods obesity was rare and achievable only by a small elite, although already recognised as a problem for health. But as prosperity increased in the Early Modern period, it affected increasingly larger groups of the population. Prior to the 1970s, obesity was a relatively rare condition even in the wealthiest of nations, and when it did exist it tended to occur among the wealthy. Then, a confluence of events started to change the human condition. The average BMI of populations in first-world countries started to increase, and consequently there was a rapid increase in the proportion of people overweight and obese.

In 1997, the WHO formally recognized obesity as a global epidemic. As of 2008, the WHO estimates that at least 500 million adults (greater than 10%) are obese, with higher rates among women than men. The global prevalence of obesity more than doubled between 1980 and 2014. In 2014, more than 600 million adults were obese, equal to about 13 percent of the world&#x27;s adult population, with that figure growing to 16% by 2022, according to the World Health Organisation The percentage of adults affected in the United States as of 2015–2016 is about 39.6% overall (37.9% of males and 41.1% of females). In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that overweight and obesity were replacing more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition and infectious diseases as one of the most significant cause of poor health.

The rate of obesity also increases with age at least up to 50 or 60 years old and severe obesity in the United States, Australia, and Canada is increasing faster than the overall rate of obesity. The OECD has projected an increase in obesity rates until at least 2030, especially in the United States, Mexico and England with rates reaching 47%, 39% and 35%, respectively.

Once considered a problem only of high-income countries, obesity rates are rising worldwide and affecting both the developed and developing world. These increases have been felt most dramatically in urban settings.

Sex- and gender-based differences also influence the prevalence of obesity. Globally there are more obese women than men, but the numbers differ depending on how obesity is measured.

==History==

===Etymology===
&quot;Obesity&quot; is from the Latin &quot;obesitas&quot;, which means &quot;stout, fat, or plump&quot;. &quot;Ēsus&quot; is the past participle of &quot;edere&quot; (to eat), with &quot;ob&quot; (over) added to it. &quot;The Oxford English Dictionary&quot; documents its first usage in 1611 by Randle Cotgrave.

===Historical attitudes===
Ancient Greek medicine recognizes obesity as a medical disorder and records that the Ancient Egyptians saw it in the same way. Hippocrates wrote that &quot;Corpulence is not only a disease itself, but the harbinger of others&quot;. The Indian surgeon Sushruta (6th century BCE) related obesity to diabetes and heart disorders. He recommended physical work to help cure it and its side effects. For most of human history, mankind struggled with food scarcity. Obesity has thus historically been viewed as a sign of wealth and prosperity. It was common among high officials in Ancient East Asian civilizations. In the 17th century, English medical author Tobias Venner is credited with being one of the first to refer to the term as a societal disease in a published English language book.

With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, it was realized that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers. Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range played a significant role in the development of industrialized societies. Height and weight thus both increased through the 19th century in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. In the 1950s, increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased, heart and kidney disease became more common.
During this time period, insurance companies realized the connection between weight and life expectancy and increased premiums for the obese.

Many cultures throughout history have viewed obesity as the result of a character flaw. The &quot;obesus&quot; or fat character in Ancient Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times, food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of sloth and lust. In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and obesity is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers.

Public perceptions in Western society regarding healthy body weight differ from those regarding the weight that is considered ideal – and both have changed since the beginning of the 20th century. The weight that is viewed as an ideal has become lower since the 1920s. This is illustrated by the fact that the average height of Miss America pageant winners increased by 2% from 1922 to 1999, while their average weight decreased by 12%. On the other hand, people&#x27;s views concerning healthy weight have changed in the opposite direction. In Britain, the weight at which people considered themselves to be overweight was significantly higher in 2007 than in 1999. These changes are believed to be due to increasing rates of adiposity leading to increased acceptance of extra body fat as being normal.

Obesity is still seen as a sign of wealth and well-being in many parts of Africa. This has become particularly common since the HIV epidemic began.

===The arts===
The first sculptural representations of the human body 20,000–35,000 years ago depict obese females. Some attribute the Venus figurines to the tendency to emphasize fertility while others feel they represent &quot;fatness&quot; in the people of the time. Corpulence is, however, absent in both Greek and Roman art, probably in keeping with their ideals regarding moderation. This continued through much of Christian European history, with only those of low socioeconomic status being depicted as obese.

During the Renaissance some of the upper class began flaunting their large size, as can be seen in portraits of Henry VIII of England and Alessandro dal Borro. Rubens (1577–1640) regularly depicted heavyset women in his pictures, from which derives the term Rubenesque. These women, however, still maintained the &quot;hourglass&quot; shape with its relationship to fertility. During the 19th century, views on obesity changed in the Western world. After centuries of obesity being synonymous with wealth and social status, slimness began to be seen as the desirable standard. In his 1819 print, &quot;The Belle Alliance, or the Female Reformers of Blackburn!!!,&quot; artist George Cruikshank criticised the work of female reformers in Blackburn and used fatness as a means to portray them as unfeminine.

==Society and culture==

===Economic impact===
In addition to its health impacts, obesity leads to many problems, including disadvantages in employment and increased business costs. 

In 2005, the medical costs attributable to obesity in the US were an estimated $190.2 billion or 20.6% of all medical expenditures, while the cost of obesity in Canada was estimated at CA$2 billion in 1997 (2.4% of total health costs). The total annual direct cost of overweight and obesity in Australia in 2005 was A$21 billion. Overweight and obese Australians also received A$35.6 billion in government subsidies. The estimated range for annual expenditures on diet products is $40 billion to $100 billion in the US alone.

The Lancet Commission on Obesity in 2019 called for a global treaty—modelled on the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control—committing countries to address obesity and undernutrition, explicitly excluding the food industry from policy development. They estimate the global cost of obesity $2 trillion a year, about or 2.8% of world GDP.

Obesity prevention programs have been found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing obesity may improve the public&#x27;s health, but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending. Sin taxes such as a sugary drink tax have been implemented in certain countries globally to curb dietary and consumer habits, and as an effort to offset the economic tolls.
Obesity can lead to social stigmatization and disadvantages in employment. When compared to their ideal weight counterparts, workers with obesity, on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40 kg/m2 filed twice as many workers&#x27; compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9 kg/m2. They also had more than 12 times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees&#x27; Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance that would otherwise be free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35 kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year. This becomes a Catch 22 position as many insurance companies will refuse to pay for treatment methods for workers living with obesity.

Some research shows that people with obesity are less likely to be hired for a job and are less likely to be promoted. People with obesity are also paid less than their counterparts who do not live with obesity for an equivalent job; women with obesity on average make 6% less and men with obesity make 3% less.

Specific industries, such as the airline, healthcare and food industries, have special concerns. Due to rising rates of obesity, airlines face higher fuel costs and pressures to increase seating width. In 2000, the extra weight of passengers with obesity cost airlines US$275 million. The healthcare industry has had to invest in special facilities for handling patients with class III obesity, including special lifting equipment and bariatric ambulances. Costs for restaurants are increased by litigation accusing them of causing obesity. In 2005, the US Congress discussed legislation to prevent civil lawsuits against the food industry in relation to obesity; however, it did not become law.

With the American Medical Association&#x27;s 2013 classification of obesity as a chronic disease, it is thought that health insurance companies will more likely pay for obesity treatment, counseling and surgery, and the cost of research and development of adipose treatment pills or gene therapy treatments should be more affordable if insurers help to subsidize their cost. The AMA classification is not legally binding, however, so health insurers still have the right to reject coverage for a treatment or procedure.

In 2014, The European Court of Justice ruled that morbid obesity is a disability. The Court said that if an employee&#x27;s obesity prevents them from &quot;full and effective participation of that person in professional life on an equal basis with other workers&quot;, then it shall be considered a disability and that firing someone on such grounds is discriminatory.

In low-income countries, obesity can be a signal of wealth. A 2023 experimental study found that obese individuals in Uganda were more likely to access credit.

===Size acceptance===


The principal goal of the fat acceptance movement is to decrease discrimination against people who are overweight and obese. However, some in the movement are also attempting to challenge the established relationship between obesity and negative health outcomes.

A number of organizations exist that promote the acceptance of obesity. They have increased in prominence in the latter half of the 20th century. The US-based National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA) was formed in 1969 and describes itself as a civil rights organization dedicated to ending size discrimination.

The International Size Acceptance Association (ISAA) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) which was founded in 1997. It has more of a global orientation and describes its mission as promoting size acceptance and helping to end weight-based discrimination. These groups often argue for the recognition of obesity as a disability under the US Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The American legal system, however, has decided that the potential public health costs exceed the benefits of extending this anti-discrimination law to cover obesity.

===Industry influence on research===
In 2015, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published an article on the Global Energy Balance Network, a nonprofit founded in 2014 that advocated for people to focus on increasing exercise rather than reducing calorie intake to avoid obesity and to be healthy. The organization was founded with at least $1.5M in funding from the Coca-Cola Company, and the company has provided $4M in research funding to the two founding scientists Gregory A. Hand and Steven N. Blair since 2008.

===Reports===
Many organizations have published reports pertaining to obesity. In 1998, the first US Federal guidelines were published, titled &quot;Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults: The Evidence Report&quot;. In 2006, the Canadian Obesity Network, now known as Obesity Canada published the &quot;Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on the Management and Prevention of Obesity in Adults and Children&quot;. This is a comprehensive evidence-based guideline to address the management and prevention of overweight and obesity in adults and children.

In 2004, the United Kingdom Royal College of Physicians, the Faculty of Public Health and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health released the report &quot;Storing up Problems&quot;, which highlighted the growing problem of obesity in the UK. The same year, the House of Commons Health Select Committee published its &quot;most comprehensive inquiry [...] ever undertaken&quot; into the impact of obesity on health and society in the UK and possible approaches to the problem. In 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued a guideline on the diagnosis and management of obesity, as well as policy implications for non-healthcare organizations such as local councils. A 2007 report produced by Derek Wanless for the King&#x27;s Fund warned that unless further action was taken, obesity had the capacity to debilitate the National Health Service financially. In 2022 the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) published a comprehensive review of research on what local authorities can do to reduce obesity.

The Obesity Policy Action (OPA) framework divides measure into &quot;upstream&quot; policies, &quot;midstream&quot; policies, and &quot;downstream&quot; policies. Upstream policies have to do with changing society, while midstream policies try to alter behaviors believed to contribute to obesity at the individual level, while downstream policies treat currently obese people.

==Childhood obesity==

The healthy BMI range varies with the age and sex of the child. Obesity in children and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95th percentile. The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity. Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21st century, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children. In the UK, there were 60% more obese children in 2005 compared to 1989. In the US, the percentage of overweight and obese children increased to 16% in 2008, a 300% increase over the prior 30 years.

As with obesity in adults, many factors contribute to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity are believed to be the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Advertising of unhealthy foods to children also contributes, as it increases their consumption of the product. Antibiotics in the first 6 months of life have been associated with excess weight at age seven to twelve years of age. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver disease.

Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Brief weight management interventions in primary care (e.g. delivered by a physician or nurse practitioner) have only a marginal positive effect in reducing childhood overweight or obesity. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.

==Other animals==

Obesity in pets is common in many countries. In the United States, 23–41% of dogs are overweight, and about 5.1% are obese. The rate of obesity in cats was slightly higher at 6.4%. In Australia, the rate of obesity among dogs in a veterinary setting has been found to be 7.6%. The risk of obesity in dogs is related to whether or not their owners are obese; however, there is no similar correlation between cats and their owners.

<text>Infrared astronomy is a sub-discipline of astronomy which specializes in the observation and analysis of astronomical objects using infrared (IR) radiation. The wavelength of infrared light ranges from 0.75 to 300 micrometers, and falls in between visible radiation, which ranges from 380 to 750 nanometers, and submillimeter waves.

Infrared astronomy began in the 1830s, a few decades after the discovery of infrared light by William Herschel in 1800. Early progress was limited, and it was not until the early 20th century that conclusive detections of astronomical objects other than the Sun and Moon were made in infrared light. After a number of discoveries were made in the 1950s and 1960s in radio astronomy, astronomers realized the information available outside the visible wavelength range, and modern infrared astronomy was established.

Infrared and optical astronomy are often practiced using the same telescopes, as the same mirrors or lenses are usually effective over a wavelength range that includes both visible and infrared light. Both fields also use solid state detectors, though the specific type of solid state photodetectors used are different. Infrared light is absorbed at many wavelengths by water vapor in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, so most infrared telescopes are at high elevations in dry places, above as much of the atmosphere as possible. There have also been infrared observatories in space, including the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Herschel Space Observatory, and more recently the James Webb Space Telescope.

==History==
The discovery of infrared radiation is attributed to William Herschel, who performed an experiment in 1800 where he placed a thermometer in sunlight of different colors after it passed through a prism. He noticed that the temperature increase induced by sunlight was highest &quot;outside&quot; the visible spectrum, just beyond the red color. That the temperature increase was highest at infrared wavelengths was due to the spectral response of the prism rather than properties of the Sun, but the fact that there was any temperature increase at all prompted Herschel to deduce that there was invisible radiation from the Sun. He dubbed this radiation &quot;calorific rays&quot;, and went on to show that it could be reflected, transmitted, and absorbed just like visible light.

Efforts were made starting in the 1830s and continuing through the 19th century to detect infrared radiation from other astronomical sources. Radiation from the Moon was first detected in 1856 by Charles Piazzi Smyth, the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, during an expedition to Tenerife to test his ideas about mountain top astronomy. Ernest Fox Nichols used a modified Crookes radiometer in an attempt to detect infrared radiation from Arcturus and Vega, but Nichols deemed the results inconclusive. Even so, the ratio of flux he reported for the two stars is consistent with the modern value, so George Rieke gives Nichols credit for the first detection of a star other than our own in the infrared.

The field of infrared astronomy continued to develop slowly in the early 20th century, as Seth Barnes Nicholson and Edison Pettit developed thermopile detectors capable of accurate infrared photometry and sensitive to a few hundreds of stars. The field was mostly neglected by traditional astronomers until the 1960s, with most scientists who practiced infrared astronomy having actually been trained physicists. The success of radio astronomy during the 1950s and 1960s, combined with the improvement of infrared detector technology, prompted more astronomers to take notice, and infrared astronomy became well established as a subfield of astronomy.

Infrared space telescopes entered service. In 1983, IRAS made an all-sky survey. In 1995, the European Space Agency created the Infrared Space Observatory. Before this satellite ran out of liquid helium in 1998, it discovered protostars and water in our universe (even on Saturn and Uranus).

On 25 August 2003, NASA launched the Spitzer Space Telescope, previously known as the Space Infrared Telescope Facility. In 2009, the telescope ran out of liquid helium and lost the ability to see far infrared. It had discovered stars, the Double Helix Nebula, and light from extrasolar planets. It continued working in 3.6 and 4.5 micrometer bands. Since then, other infrared telescopes helped find new stars that are forming, nebulae, and stellar nurseries. Infrared telescopes have opened up a whole new part of the galaxy for us. They are also useful for observing extremely distant things, like quasars. Quasars move away from Earth. The resulting large redshift make them difficult targets with an optical telescope. Infrared telescopes give much more information about them.

During May 2008, a group of international infrared astronomers proved that intergalactic dust greatly dims the light of distant galaxies. In actuality, galaxies are almost twice as bright as they look. The dust absorbs much of the visible light and re-emits it as infrared light.

== Modern infrared astronomy ==
Infrared radiation with wavelengths just longer than visible light, known as near-infrared, behaves in a very similar way to visible light, and can be detected using similar solid state devices (because of this, many quasars, stars, and galaxies were discovered). For this reason, the near infrared region of the spectrum is commonly incorporated as part of the &quot;optical&quot; spectrum, along with the near ultraviolet. Many optical telescopes, such as those at Keck Observatory, operate effectively in the near infrared as well as at visible wavelengths. The far-infrared extends to submillimeter wavelengths, which are observed by telescopes such as the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory.

Like all other forms of electromagnetic radiation, infrared is utilized by astronomers to study the universe. Indeed, infrared measurements taken by the 2MASS and WISE astronomical surveys have been particularly effective at unveiling previously undiscovered star clusters. Examples of such embedded star clusters are FSR 1424, FSR 1432, Camargo 394, Camargo 399, Majaess 30, and Majaess 99. Infrared telescopes, which includes most major optical telescopes as well as a few dedicated infrared telescopes, need to be chilled with liquid nitrogen and shielded from warm objects. The reason for this is that objects with temperatures of a few hundred kelvins emit most of their thermal energy at infrared wavelengths. If infrared detectors were not kept cooled, the radiation from the detector itself would contribute noise that would dwarf the radiation from any celestial source. This is particularly important in the mid-infrared and far-infrared regions of the spectrum.

To achieve higher angular resolution, some infrared telescopes are combined to form astronomical interferometers. The effective resolution of an interferometer is set by the distance between the telescopes, rather than the size of the individual telescopes. When used together with adaptive optics, infrared interferometers, such as two 10 meter telescopes at Keck Observatory or the four 8.2 meter telescopes that make up the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, can achieve high angular resolution.
The principal limitation on infrared sensitivity from ground-based telescopes is the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Water vapor absorbs a significant amount of infrared radiation, and the atmosphere itself emits at infrared wavelengths. For this reason, most infrared telescopes are built in very dry places at high altitude, so that they are above most of the water vapor in the atmosphere. Suitable locations on Earth include Mauna Kea Observatory at 4205 meters above sea level, the Paranal Observatory at 2635 meters in Chile and regions of high altitude ice-desert such as Dome C in Antarctic. Even at high altitudes, the transparency of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is limited except in infrared windows, or wavelengths where the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is transparent. The main infrared windows are listed below:

As is the case for visible light telescopes, space is the ideal place for infrared telescopes. Telescopes in space can achieve higher resolution, as they do not suffer from blurring caused by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and are also free from infrared absorption caused by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Current infrared telescopes in space include the Herschel Space Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and the James Webb Space Telescope. Since putting telescopes in orbit is expensive, there are also airborne observatories, such as the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy and the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. These observatories fly above most, but not all, of the atmosphere, and water vapor in the atmosphere absorbs some of infrared light from space. 
== Infrared technology ==
One of the most common infrared detector arrays used at research telescopes is HgCdTe arrays. These operate well between 0.6 and 5 micrometre wavelengths. For longer wavelength observations or higher sensitivity other detectors may be used, including other narrow gap semiconductor detectors, low temperature bolometer arrays or photon-counting Superconducting Tunnel Junction arrays.

Special requirements for infrared astronomy include: very low dark currents to allow long integration times, associated low noise readout circuits and sometimes very high pixel counts.

Low temperature is often achieved by a coolant, which can run out. Space missions have either ended or shifted to &quot;warm&quot; observations when the coolant supply used up. For example, WISE ran out of coolant in October 2010, about ten months after being launched. (See also NICMOS, Spitzer Space Telescope)

=== Space observatories ===

Many space telescopes detect electromagnetic radiation in a wavelength range that overlaps at least to some degree with the infrared wavelength range. Therefore it is difficult to define which space telescopes are infrared telescopes. Here the definition of &quot;infrared space telescope&quot; is taken to be a space telescope whose main mission is detecting infrared light.

Eight infrared space telescopes have been operated in space. They are:

* Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), operated 1983 (10 months). A joint mission of US (NASA), UK and the Netherlands.
* Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), operated 1995-1998, ESA mission.
* Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), operated 1996-1997, BMDO mission.
* Spitzer Space Telescope, operated 2003-2020, NASA mission.
* Akari, operated 2006-2011, JAXA mission.
* Herschel Space Observatory, operated 2009-2013, ESA mission.
* Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), operated 2009-2024, NASA mission.
* James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), operated 2022-, NASA mission.
* Euclid telescope, operated 2023-, ESA mission.

In addition, SPHEREx is a telescope scheduled for launch in 2025. NASA is also planning to launch the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST), originally known as the Wide Field InfraRed Space Telescope (WFIRST), in 2027.

Many other smaller space-missions and space-based detectors of infrared radiation have been operated in space. These include the Infrared Telescope (IRT) that flew with the Space Shuttle.

The Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) is sometimes mentioned as an infrared satellite, although it is a submillimeter satellite.

==== Infrared instruments on space telescopes ====

For many space telescopes, only some of the instruments are capable of infrared observation. Below are listed some of the most notable of these space observatories and instruments:

* Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite (1989-1993) Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) instrument
* Hubble Space Telescope (1990-) Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instrument (1997-1999, 2002-2008)
* Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) camera (2009-) observes infrared.

=== Airborne Observatories ===

Three airplane-based observatories have been used (other aircraft have also been used occasionally to host infrared space studies) to study the sky in infrared. They are:

* Galileo Observatory, a NASA mission. Was active 1965-1973.
* Kuiper Airborne Observatory, a NASA mission. Was active 1974-1995.
* SOFIA, a NASA-DLR mission. Was active 2010-2022.

=== Ground-based observatories ===

Many ground-based infrared telescopes exist around the world. The largest are:

* VISTA
* UKIRT
* IRTF
* WIRO

<doc id="56438" wikidata="Q417738" url="?curid=56438" title="Akhnaten (opera)">
<text>Akhnaten is an opera in three acts based on the life and religious convictions of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV), written by the American composer Philip Glass in 1983. The libretto is by Philip Glass in association with Shalom Goldman, Robert Israel, Richard Riddell, and Jerome Robbins. According to the composer, this work is the culmination of a trilogy including his two other biographical operas, &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; (about Albert Einstein) and &quot;Satyagraha&quot; (about Mahatma Gandhi). These three people were all driven by an inner vision which altered the age in which they lived: Akhenaten in religion, Einstein in science, and Gandhi in politics.

The text, taken from original sources, is sung in the original languages, linked together with the commentary of a narrator in a modern language, such as English or German. Egyptian texts of the period are taken from a poem of Akhenaten himself, from the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, and from extracts of decrees and letters from the Amarna Period, the seventeen-year period of Akhenaten&#x27;s rule. Other portions are in Akkadian and Biblical Hebrew. Akhnaten&#x27;s Hymn to the Sun is sung in the language of the audience.

== Performance history ==
&quot;Akhnaten&quot; was commissioned by Württembergische Staatstheater, Stuttgart and had its world premiere on March 24, 1984, at the Stuttgart State Theatre, under the German title &quot;Echnaton&quot;. Paul Esswood sang the title role, German director Achim Freyer staged the opera in an abstract style with highly ritualistic movements. The American premiere, directed by David Freeman, was on October 12, 1984, at the Houston Grand Opera, where Glass&#x27;s opera &quot;The Making of the Representative for Planet 8&quot; also premiered. The UK premiere, based on the American production, was on June 17, 1985, by English National Opera at the London Coliseum. This production was revived at the London Coliseum in March 1987.

The award-winning Polish premiere, directed by Henryk Baranowski, was on May 20, 2000, at the Grand Theatre in Łódź. The French premiere was on September 23, 2002, at Opéra national du Rhin in Strasbourg as a co-production with Boston Lyric Opera which had premiered the production in February 2002
A new co-production by English National Opera and LA Opera and in collaboration with Improbable directed by Phelim McDermott starring Anthony Roth Costanzo and Zachary James premiered at the London Coliseum on March 4, 2016, which won a 2017 Olivier Award, and at LA Opera on November 5, 2016. A revival of this production in London took place in March 2019 and played at the Metropolitan Opera in their 2019/2020 season, winning the 2022 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording. The 2019 Met production was streamed online on June 20 and November 14, 2020, and February 12, 2021, and returned in 2022. A new production directed and choreographed by Nanine Linning premiered at Theater Heidelberg on June 6, 2014, another new production directed by Laura Scozzi premiered at Oper Bonn on March 11, 2018.

A November 2020 production at Opéra de Nice Côte d’Azur was performed without an audience and screened online, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This production was produced and choreographed by longtime Glass collaborator Lucinda Childs, who conducted rehearsals remotely. She also performed the speaking roles in the opera, which were pre-recorded and projected during the performance.

== Roles ==
== Music ==
The orchestra&#x27;s size is about the size employed for early 19th-century opera: 2 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (both doubling oboe d&#x27;amore), 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 2 french horns, 2 trumpets, 2 trombones, tuba, percussion (3 players), celesta (doubling synthesizer), 12 violas, 8 celli, and 6 double basses.

Since the Stuttgart State Opera house was being restored in 1984 and the orchestra pit of the &quot;&quot; at the Stuttgart State Theatre, where the premiere was to take place, was considerably smaller, Glass chose to completely leave out the violins (about 20), giving the orchestra a darker, sombre character. Apart from this, this was Glass&#x27;s most &quot;conventional&quot; opera orchestra until then (compared to &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, written for the six-piece Philip Glass Ensemble, and &quot;Satyagraha&quot;, scored for woodwinds and strings only). 

== Synopsis ==
The opera is divided into three acts:

=== Act 1: Year 1 of Akhnaten&#x27;s Reign in Thebes ===
&quot;Thebes, 1370 BC&quot;

&quot;Prelude, verse 1, verse 2, verse 3&quot;

Set in the key of A minor, the strings introduce a ground bass theme, with following variations. (A passacaglia). The scribe recites funeral texts from the pyramids. &quot;Open are the double doors of the horizon; unlocked are its bolts.&quot;

&quot;Scene 1: Funeral of Akhnaten&#x27;s father Amenhotep III&quot;

Heralded by hammering drums, Aye and a small male chorus chant a funeral hymn in Egyptian, later joined by the full chorus. The music is basically a march, based on the chords of A major and F minor (with added major sixth), and grows to ecstatic intensity towards the end.

&quot;Scene 2: The Coronation of Akhnaten&quot;

After a lengthy orchestral introduction, during which Akhnaten appears, heralded by a solo trumpet, the High Priest, Aye, and Horemhab sing a ritual text. After that, the Narrator recites a list of royal titles bestowed upon Akhnaten, while he is crowned. After the coronation, the chorus repeats the ritual text from the beginning of the scene. Again, the main key is A minor.

&quot;Scene 3: The Window of Appearances&quot;

After an introduction in A minor, dominated by tubular bells, Akhnaten sings a praise to the Creator (in Egyptian) at the window of public appearances. This is the first time he actually sings, after he has already been on stage for 20 minutes (and 40 minutes into the opera) and the effect of his countertenor voice (which in 1983 was even more rare than nowadays) is startling. He is joined by Queen Tye, whose soprano soars high above the soon intertwining voices of the royal couple, and later by Nefertiti, who actually sings lower notes than he.

=== Act 2: Years 5 to 15 in Thebes and Akhetaten ===
&quot;Scene 1: The Temple&quot;

The scene opens again in A minor, with the High Priest and a group of priests singing a hymn to Amun, principal god of the old order, in his temple. The music becomes increasingly dramatic, as Akhnaten, together with Queen Tye and his followers, attack the temple. This scene has only wordless singing. The harmonies grow very chromatic, finally reaching A major and E minor. The temple roof is removed and the sun god Aten&#x27;s rays invade the temple, thus ending Amun&#x27;s reign and laying the foundation for the worship of the One God: the Sun God Aten.

&quot;Scene 2: Akhnaten and Nefertiti&quot;

Two solo celli introduce a &quot;love theme&quot;. Accompanied by a solo trombone while the harmony switches to B(sus), the Narrator recites a prayer-like poem to the sun god. The strings softly take over the music in E minor, and the same poem is recited again, this time actually as a love poem from Akhnaten to Nefertiti. Then Akhnaten and Nefertiti sing the same text to each other (in Egyptian), as an intimate love duet. After a while, the trumpet associated with Akhnaten joins them as the highest voice, turning the duet into a trio.

&quot;Scene 3: The City – Dance&quot;

The Narrator speaks a text taken from the boundary stones of the new capital of the empire, Akhet-Aten (The Horizon of Aten), describing the construction of the city, with large, light-filled spaces. After a brass fanfare, the completion of the city is celebrated in a light-hearted dance, contrasting with the stark, ritualistic music with which this act began. (In the Stuttgart premiere, the dance actually described the construction of the city.) The dance scene was omitted from the UK premiere production and its 1987 revival.

&quot;Scene 4: Hymn&quot;

What now follows is a hymn to the only god Aten, a long aria (alternating between A minor and A major) by Akhnaten, and the central piece of the opera. Notably, it is the only text sung in the language of the audience, praising the sun giving life to everything. After the aria, an off-stage chorus sings Psalm 104 in Hebrew, dating some 400 years later, which has strong resemblances to Akhnaten&#x27;s Hymn, thus emphasizing Akhnaten as the first founder of a monotheistic religion.

=== Act 3: Year 17 and the Present ===
&quot;Akhnaten, 1358 BC&quot;

&quot;Scene 1: The Family&quot;

Two oboes d&#x27;amore play the &quot;love theme&quot; from act 2. Akhnaten, Nefertiti and their six daughters, sing wordlessly in contemplation. They are oblivious to what happens outside of the palace. As the music switches from E minor to F minor, the Narrator reads letters from Syrian vassals, asking for help against their enemies. Since the king does not send troops, his land is being seized and plundered by their enemies. The scene focuses again on Akhnaten and his family, still oblivious to the country falling apart.

&quot;Scene 2: The Attack and Fall of the City&quot;

The music moves again to a vigorous F minor. Horemhab, Aye and the High Priest of Amon instigate the people (as the chorus), singing part of the vassal&#x27;s letters (in their original Akkadian language) until finally the palace is attacked, the royal family killed, and the city of the sun destroyed.

&quot;Scene 3: The Ruins&quot;

The music of the very beginning of the opera returns. The scribe recites an inscription on Aye&#x27;s tomb, praising the death of &quot;the great criminal&quot; and the new reign of the old gods. He then describes the restoration of Amun&#x27;s temple by Akhnaten&#x27;s son Tutankhamun. The Prelude music grows stronger and the scene moves to present-day Egypt, to the ruins of Amarna, the former capital Akhetaten. The Narrator appears as a modern tourist guide and speaks a text from a guide book, describing the ruins. &quot;There is nothing left of this glorious city of temples and palaces.&quot;

&quot;Scene 4: Epilogue&quot;

The ghosts of Akhnaten, Nefertiti and Queen Tye appear, singing wordlessly amongst the ruins. The funeral procession from the beginning of the opera appears on the horizon, and they join it. The music introduces a bass line from the beginning of &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, the first part of Glass&#x27;s &quot;portrait&quot; trilogy (The second one being &quot;Satyagraha&quot; and the third one &quot;Akhnaten&quot;), thus providing a musical bracket for the whole trilogy.

<doc id="56439" wikidata="Q174843" url="?curid=56439" title="Jeff Bridges">
<text>Jeffrey Leon Bridges (born December 4, 1949) is an American actor. He is known for his leading man roles in film and television. In a career spanning over seven decades, he has received various accolades, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe, in addition to nominations for three BAFTA Awards and two Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2019, he was awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Award.

Born into a prominent acting family, Bridges appeared on the television series &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; (1958–1960) alongside his father, Lloyd, and brother, Beau. He made his feature film debut in the drama &quot;Halls of Anger&quot; (1970), and starred in &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971), which earned him his first Academy Award nomination. As a leading man, he starred in the adventure film &quot;King Kong&quot; (1976); science fiction film &quot;Tron&quot; (1982); thrillers &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Morning After&quot; (1986); dramas &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; (1989), &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; (1996); and crime comedy &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998).

Bridges received further Oscar nominations for his roles in &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot; (1974), &quot;Starman&quot; (1984), &quot;The Contender&quot; (2000), &quot;True Grit&quot; (2010), and &quot;Hell or High Water&quot; (2016); and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as an alcoholic singer in &quot;Crazy Heart&quot; (2009). He has also starred in big-budget films, such as &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; (2003), &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008), and &quot;&quot; (2010). On television, he earned Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his performances in the HBO film &quot;A Dog Year&quot; (2009), and the Hulu series &quot;The Old Man&quot; (2022–2024).

== Early life and education ==
Bridges was born on December 4, 1949, in Los Angeles, the son of actor Lloyd Bridges (1913–1998) and actress and writer Dorothy Bridges (née Simpson; 1915–2009). He is one of four children: older brother Beau Bridges (born December 9, 1941), who is also an actor; a younger sister Lucinda; and a brother named Garrett, who died of sudden infant death syndrome in 1948. His maternal grandfather was an immigrant from Liverpool, England.

Bridges and his siblings were raised in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. He shared a close relationship with his brother Beau, who acted as a surrogate father when their father was working. He graduated from University High School in 1967. At age 17 he toured with his father in a stage production of &quot;Anniversary Waltz&quot;, and then moved to New York City, where he studied acting at the Herbert Berghof Studio. He also served in the United States Coast Guard Reserve as a boatswain&#x27;s mate from 1967 to 1975 in San Luis Obispo, California, with a terminal rating of Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Second Class.

== Career ==
=== 1951–1970: Early roles ===

Bridges made his first screen appearance in an uncredited role in &quot;The Company She Keeps&quot; (1951); the film was released shortly after his first birthday. In his youth, Bridges and his brother Beau made occasional appearances on their father&#x27;s show &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; (1958–1961) and the CBS anthology series &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot; (1962–1963). In 1965, he played a supporting role alongside his father in an episode of &quot;The Loner&quot;. In 1969, he played Job Corps crew member Cal Baker in the &quot;Lassie&quot; episode &quot;Success Story&quot;.

=== 1971–1989: Breakthrough and stardom ===
In 1971, he played the lead role Mike in the television film &quot;In Search of America&quot;. His first major role came in the 1971 film &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, for which he garnered a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He next co-starred in the 1972 gritty boxing film &quot;Fat City&quot;, directed by John Huston. In 1973, he starred as Junior Jackson in &quot;The Last American Hero&quot;, a film based on the true story of NASCAR driver Junior Johnson. He was again nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his performance opposite Clint Eastwood in the 1974 film &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot;.

In 1976, he starred as the protagonist Jack Prescott in the first remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;, opposite Jessica Lange. This film was a commercial success, earning $90 million worldwide, more than triple its $23 million budget, and also winning an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. Towards the end of the decade he acted in mystery &quot;Somebody Killed Her Husband&quot; (1978) opposite Farrah Fawcett, the satirical black comedy &quot;Winter Kills&quot; (1979) alongside John Huston, and the comedy-drama &quot;The American Success Company&quot; (1979). In 1980 he acted in Michael Cimino&#x27;s large Western ensemble film &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; acting opposite Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, John Hurt, Sam Waterston, and Isabelle Huppert. The film was a public critical and commercial failure and was blamed for the downfall of the studio, United Artists. 
In 1982, Bridges starred in one of his better-known roles in the science fiction film &quot;Tron&quot;, in which he played Kevin Flynn, a video game programmer. Critic Roger Ebert praised the film describing it as &quot;brilliant&quot; and comparing it to &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), writing, &quot;This movie is machine to dazzle and delight us...[and] in a technical way maybe it&#x27;s breaking ground for a generation of movies in which computer-generated universes will be the background for mind-generated stories about emotion-generated personalities&quot;. Also in 1982 he voiced Prince Lir in the animated fantasy film &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; alongside Alan Arkin, Mia Farrow, and Angela Lansbury and starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Kiss Me Goodbye&quot; directed by Robert Mulligan, acting alongside Sally Field.

In 1984, he starred in the John Carpenter directed science fiction romance &quot;Starman&quot; playing an alien opposite Karen Allen. For his performance he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. During this period he also performed in the neo-noir &quot;Against All Odds&quot; (1984) with James Woods and Rachel Ward, the thrillers &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; (1985) opposite Glenn Close and &quot;The Morning After&quot; (1986) with Jane Fonda, and the crime comedy &quot;Nadine&quot; (1987) alongside Kim Basinger. In 1988 he portrayed automobile entrepreneur Preston Tucker in the Francis Ford Coppola directed biographical film &quot;&quot; which earned positive reviews. The following year he acted in two romance films, the Alan J. Pakula directed &quot;See You in the Morning&quot; with Alice Krige and Farrah Fawcett and the Steve Kloves directed &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; starring opposite Michelle Pfeiffer and his real life brother Beau Bridges.

=== 1990–2007: Established actor ===

In 1990 he reunited with Cybill Shepard for Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;Texasville&quot;, a sequel to the 1971 film &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, which Bridges had starred in. The film also starred Cloris Leachman, Eileen Brennan, and Randy Quaid. The film was based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Larry McMurtry. Bridges said of making the film, &quot;[It] was like constantly being hit over the head by deja vu. Every day I&#x27;d grab Peter and place him in some corner on the street where we were shooting and I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Now 20 years ago what did you say to me as I was standing right here?&#x27;&quot;. The following year he starred in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s fantasy comedy-drama &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991) opposite Robin Williams, Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer. In the film he plays a misanthropic radio shock jock who befriends a homeless person on the quest to find love and the Holy Grail. For their performances they both received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In 1992 he produced and starred as a man released from prison in the Martin Bel directed drama &quot;American Heart&quot; earning the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead. Film critic Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Bridges&#x27; performance writing, &quot;It&#x27;s time to recognize Mr. Bridges as the most underappreciated great actor of his generation...he has managed to transform himself to an astonishing degree.&quot;

In 1993 he starred in the Peter Weir directed drama &quot;Fearless&quot; (1993) alongside Isabella Rossellini, John Turturro, and Rosie Perez. His role is thought by some critics to be one of his best performances. One critic dubbed it a masterpiece; Pauline Kael wrote that he &quot;may be the most natural and least self-conscious screen actor that has ever lived&quot;. In 1994, he starred as Lt. Jimmy Dove in the action film &quot;Blown Away&quot;, opposite Tommy Lee Jones and Forest Whitaker. His real-life father Lloyd Bridges was also featured in the film, playing the uncle of Bridges&#x27; character. The film was not a financial success, managing to recoup $30 million of its $50 million budget at the box office, with its release a few weeks after another explosive-themed film, &quot;Speed&quot;. On July 11, 1994, Bridges received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture industry. The star is located at 7065 Hollywood Boulevard. Bridges portrayed James Butler &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok in the western film &quot;Wild Bill&quot; (1995) acting with Ellen Burstyn, John Hurt and Bruce Dern. The film received mixed reviews and was a box-office bomb. In 1996 he acted in the Showtime television film &quot;Hidden in America&quot; alongside his brother Beau Bridges and Frances McDormand.
The following year acted in Ridley Scott&#x27;s survival drama &quot;White Squall&quot; and co-starred with Barbra Streisand in the romantic comedy &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;. In 1998, he starred as what is arguably his most iconic role, Jeffrey &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski, in the Coen brothers&#x27; noir comedy &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. He played a fictional president of the United States in the political drama &quot;The Contender&quot; acting opposite Gary Oldman and Joan Allen. For his performance he earned his fourth Academy Award nomination as well as nods for the Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor. The following year he acted in the science-fiction drama &quot;K-Pax&quot; opposite Kevin Spacey. He portrayed businessman Charles S. Howard in the horse racing drama film &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; co-starring with Tobey Maguire and Chris Cooper. The film was based on the by Laura Hillenbrand. The film earned an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination. He also starred in the 2005 Terry Gilliam fantasy film &quot;Tideland&quot; co-starring with Janet McTeer and Jennifer Tilly. That was Bridges&#x27; second collaboration with Gilliam, the first being 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Fisher King&quot; alongside Robin Williams.

Bridges hosted VH1&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Greatest Albums of Rock and Roll&quot; series in 2001. Bridges narrated the documentary &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; (2002), about the making of a Terry Gilliam retelling of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, tentatively titled &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;, which would have starred Johnny Depp as Sancho Panza and Jean Rochefort as the quixotic hero. Bridges also narrated the documentaries National Geographic&#x27;s &quot;Lewis &amp; Clark: Great Journey West&quot; (2002, IMAX), Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Raising the Mammoth&quot; (2000), and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Heroes of Rock and Roll&quot; (1979). He voiced the character Big Z in the animated film &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (2007). Bridges has performed TV commercial voiceover work as well, including Hyundai&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Think About It&quot; advertising campaign, and the Duracell advertisements in the &quot;Trusted Everywhere&quot; campaign.

=== 2008–present: Career expansion ===

In 2008, Bridges shaved his head to play the role of Obadiah Stane in the Marvel comic book adaptation of &quot;Iron Man&quot; starring Robert Downey Jr. In July 2008, at San Diego Comic-Con, he appeared in a teaser, reprising his 1982 fan favorite role of Kevin Flynn for &quot;&quot;. Also in 2008 he acted in the HBO film &quot;A Dog Year&quot; earning a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He then acted in the comedy films &quot;How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Open Road&quot; (2009). He gained widespread acclaim for his role as an alcoholic country singer in &quot;Crazy Heart&quot; (2009) for which he earned the Academy Award for Best Actor as well as the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Bridges is one of the youngest actors ever to be nominated for an Academy Award (1972, age 22, Best Supporting Actor, &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;), and one of the oldest ever to win (winning the Best Actor in 2010 at age 60 for &quot;Crazy Heart&quot;).

In 2009, he acted in the satirical comedy &quot;The Men Who Stare at Goats&quot; alongside George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, and Kevin Spacey. In 2010 he reprised his role as Kevin Flynn in &quot;&quot; acting with Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde. Bridges received his sixth Academy Award nomination for his role in &quot;True Grit&quot;, a collaboration with the Coen brothers in which he starred alongside Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper, and Hailee Steinfeld. Both the film and Bridges&#x27; performance as Rooster Cogburn, were critically praised. Bridges lost to Colin Firth, whom he had beaten for the Oscar in the same category the previous year. On December 18, 2010, Bridges hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; he had hosted the show before in 1983 with his brother, Beau. With the December 18, 2010, episode Bridges beat Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s record for longest gap between hosting appearances on &quot;SNL&quot; (Weaver had a 24-year gap between her first time hosting in 1986 and her second time hosting in 2010, while Bridges had a 27-year gap between his first appearance in 1983 and his most recent one, also in 2010).
In 2013, he starred alongside Ryan Reynolds in the action comedy &quot;R.I.P.D.&quot; which was a box office and critical failure. That same year Bridges wrote &quot;The Dude and the Zen Master&quot; with Bernie Glassman. Bridges found himself at a party with Glassman and Ram Dass and their conversation led to discussing the parallels between &quot;The Dude&quot; from &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and Zen Buddhism. The book was formed from what has been described as a &quot;transcript of a five-day &#x27;hang&#x27; on a Montana ranch.&quot; The following year he produced and starred as the title role in dystopian drama &quot;The Giver&quot; and acted in the action fantasy film &quot;Seventh Son&quot;, which were both critically panned and the latter a box office flop. In 2015 Bridges voiced The Aviator in the animated film &quot;The Little Prince&quot; based on the 1943 children&#x27;s novella of the same name. The following year he narrated the documentary &quot;Dream Big: Engineering Our World&quot; (2015) and acted in the Taylor Sheridan directed neo-Western drama film &quot;Hell or High Water&quot; (2015) opposite Chris Pine and Ben Foster. For the role he received his a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, which would be his seventh Oscar nomination.

In 2017, he acted in the romantic drama &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; with Callum Turner and Kate Beckinsale and in the spy action comedy &quot;&quot; starring Taron Egerton and Colin Firth. In 2018 he acted in the neo-noir ensemble thriller &quot;Bad Times at the El Royale&quot; with Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, and Jon Hamm. For his contribution to films, he was presented with the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2019. Starting in 2022 he acted in the FX drama thriller series &quot;The Old Man&quot; opposite John Lithgow. For his performance he earned nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama. In 2024, Bridges received the annual Chaplin Gala Award which was held at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center. Also in 2024, it was announced that Bridges would be reprising his role as Kevin Flynn in &quot;&quot;.

In June 2024, he was cast as God in the upcoming comedy film &quot;&quot;.

== Interests ==
=== Music ===

Referring to his career as an actor and his passion for music, Bridges says, &quot;I dug what an actor did, but it took me a while to feel it, to truly appreciate the craft and the preparation. Plus, I was still playing music a lot, and I guess I had a hard time choosing: was I an actor or a musician, or could I be both?&quot; Bridges studied piano at a young age, strongly encouraged by his mother. Before his first lead role as an actor he already sold two songs to the acclaimed musician and composer Quincy Jones, who used his &quot;Lost in Space&quot; for the soundtrack of the 1970 film &quot;John and Mary&quot; and let Bridges contribute the vocals. While working on the 1980 film &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, he often played guitar with his co-star, singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson, between takes. His character in &quot;Crazy Heart&quot;, Bad Blake, was later based partly on Kristofferson. In 1982, he voiced the character of Prince Lír in the animated film &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;, and in that role sang on two songs, including a duet with Mia Farrow. He released his debut album &quot;Be Here Soon&quot; on January 1, 2000. In 2005, Bridges, known as &quot;The Dude&quot; in the film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, showed up at a Lebowski Fest in Los Angeles singing and playing the film&#x27;s theme song written by Bob Dylan, &quot;Man in Me&quot;.

On January 15, 2010, Bridges performed the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; from &quot;Crazy Heart&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. In the film &quot;The Contender&quot;, in which he co-starred, Bridges recorded a version of Johnny Cash&#x27;s standard &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; with Kim Carnes that played over the pivotal opening credits. In February 2010, he was among the nearly 80 musicians to sing on the charity-single remake of &quot;We Are the World&quot;. On October 24, 2010, Bridges appeared at Neil Young&#x27;s annual &quot;Bridge School Benefit&quot; concert and played a set with singer-songwriter Neko Case. On April 19, 2011, Country Music Television announced that Bridges had signed a recording contract with Blue Note Records/EMI Music Group. He worked with producer T Bone Burnett and released his second album, &quot;Jeff Bridges,&quot; on August 16, 2011. On November 5, 2011, Bridges played Austin City Limits in support of this album.

In 2015, he sang on the album &quot;Strangers Again&quot;, performing a duet with Judy Collins of the song &quot;Make Our Garden Grow&quot; from &quot;Candide&quot; by Leonard Bernstein. The same year, he released an ambient/spoken-word album entitled &quot;Sleeping Tapes&quot;. All proceeds from the album go directly to Bridges&#x27; charity No Kid Hungry. Bridges plays many guitars, including the Gretsch Chet Atkins Country Gentlemen Model G6122-19. In 2020, Bridges partnered with Breedlove Guitars to release his signature Oregon Concerto Bourbon CE with &quot;All In This Together&quot; scrawled across the fretboard.

=== Photography ===
Bridges has been an amateur photographer since high school. He began taking photographs on film sets during &quot;Starman&quot; at the suggestion of co-star Karen Allen in 1984, with his favorite camera, a Widelux F8 that his wife bought him. He published many of these photographs online and in a 2003 book entitled &quot;Pictures: Photographs by Jeff Bridges&quot;. In 2013, he received an Infinity Award for his photos from the International Center of Photography in New York. A follow-up book, &quot;Jeff Bridges: Pictures Volume Two&quot;, was published in 2019.

== Personal life ==

Bridges and his siblings inherited their family house in Malibu from their parents. In January 2025, the house burned down in the Palisades Fire.

=== Marriage and family ===
Bridges married Susan Geston in 1977. They had met while filming &quot;Rancho Deluxe&quot; (1975), on a ranch where Geston had been working as a waitress. They have three daughters, born in 1981, 1983 and 1985.

=== Religious beliefs ===
Bridges has studied Buddhism and has described himself as &quot;a Buddhistly bent guy&quot;. On most days, he meditates for half an hour before beginning work on a film set.

=== Health problems ===
On October 19, 2020, Bridges announced that he had been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and has gone through chemotherapy. On September 12, 2021, Bridges announced that his cancer was in remission: &quot;My cancer is in remission — the 9&quot; × 12&quot; [] mass has shrunk down to the size of a marble.&quot; Bridges also announced he contracted COVID-19 while in treatment and which he fought for almost five weeks.

He described the long process of recovery from both diseases, relating how large his tumor had grown, yet being unaware it was there. After five weeks in the hospital with Covid, he had months of recuperation at home before he could function again.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 1984, Bridges and other entertainment industry leaders founded the End Hunger Network aimed at encouraging, stimulating and supporting action to end childhood hunger. He supported President Obama&#x27;s initiative to End Childhood Hunger by 2015. In November 2010, Bridges became spokesman for the No Kid Hungry campaign of the organization Share our Strength. Its goal is to present and undertake a state-by-state strategy to end childhood hunger in the United States by 2015. Bridges also supports environmental causes and organizations such as the Amazon Conservation Team.

<doc id="56440" wikidata="Q4112212" url="?curid=56440" title="Orbital inclination">
<text>Orbital inclination measures the tilt of an object&#x27;s orbit around a celestial body. It is expressed as the angle between a reference plane and the orbital plane or axis of direction of the orbiting object.

For a satellite orbiting the Earth directly above the Equator, the plane of the satellite&#x27;s orbit is the same as the Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane, and the satellite&#x27;s orbital inclination is 0°. The general case for a circular orbit is that it is tilted, spending half an orbit over the northern hemisphere and half over the southern. If the orbit swung between 20° north latitude and 20° south latitude, then its orbital inclination would be 20°.

==Orbits==
The inclination is one of the six orbital elements describing the shape and orientation of a celestial orbit. It is the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of reference, normally stated in degrees. For a satellite orbiting a planet, the plane of reference is usually the plane containing the planet&#x27;s equator. For planets in the Solar System, the plane of reference is usually the ecliptic, the plane in which the Earth orbits the Sun. This reference plane is most practical for Earth-based observers. Therefore, Earth&#x27;s inclination is, by definition, zero.

Inclination can instead be measured with respect to another plane, such as the Sun&#x27;s equator or the invariable plane (the plane that represents the angular momentum of the Solar System, approximately the orbital plane of Jupiter).

===Natural and artificial satellites===
The inclination of orbits of natural or artificial satellites is measured relative to the equatorial plane of the body they orbit, if they orbit sufficiently closely. The equatorial plane is the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the central body.

An inclination of 30° could also be described using an angle of 150°. The convention is that the normal orbit is prograde, an orbit in the same direction as the planet rotates. Inclinations greater than 90° describe retrograde orbits (backward). Thus:
* An inclination of 0° means the orbiting body has a prograde orbit in the planet&#x27;s equatorial plane.
* An inclination greater than 0° and less than 90° also describes a prograde orbit.
* An inclination of 63.4° is often called a critical inclination, when describing artificial satellites orbiting the Earth, because they have zero apogee drift.
* An inclination of exactly 90° is a polar orbit, in which the spacecraft passes over the poles of the planet.
* An inclination greater than 90° and less than 180° is a retrograde orbit.
* An inclination of exactly 180° is a retrograde equatorial orbit.

For impact-generated moons of terrestrial planets not too far from their star, with a large planet–moon distance, the orbital planes of moons tend to be aligned with the planet&#x27;s orbit around the star due to tides from the star, but if the planet–moon distance is small, it may be inclined. For gas giants, the orbits of moons tend to be aligned with the giant planet&#x27;s equator, because these formed in circumplanetary disks. Strictly speaking, this applies only to regular satellites. Captured bodies on distant orbits vary widely in their inclinations, while captured bodies in relatively close orbits tend to have low inclinations owing to tidal effects and perturbations by large regular satellites.

===Exoplanets and multiple star systems===
The inclination of exoplanets or members of multi-star star systems is the angle of the plane of the orbit relative to the plane perpendicular to the line of sight from Earth to the object.
* An inclination of 0° is a face-on orbit, meaning the plane of the exoplanet&#x27;s orbit is perpendicular to the line of sight with Earth.
* An inclination of 90° is an edge-on orbit, meaning the plane of the exoplanet&#x27;s orbit is parallel to the line of sight with Earth.

Since the word &quot;inclination&quot; is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination, the angle between the planet&#x27;s orbit and its star&#x27;s rotational axis is expressed using the term the &quot;spin-orbit angle&quot; or &quot;spin-orbit alignment&quot;. In most cases the orientation of the star&#x27;s rotational axis is unknown.

Because the radial-velocity method more easily finds planets with orbits closer to edge-on, most exoplanets found by this method have inclinations between 45° and 135°, although in most cases the inclination is not known. Consequently, most exoplanets found by radial velocity have true masses no more than 40% greater than their minimum masses. If the orbit is almost face-on, especially for superjovians detected by radial velocity, then those objects may actually be brown dwarfs or even red dwarfs. One particular example is HD 33636 B, which has true mass 142 MJ, corresponding to an M6V star, while its minimum mass was 9.28 MJ.

If the orbit is almost edge-on, then the planet can be seen transiting its star.

==Calculation==

In astrodynamics, the inclination formula_1 can be computed from the orbital momentum vector formula_2 (or any vector perpendicular to the orbital plane) as
formula_3
where formula_4 is the z-component of formula_2.

Mutual inclination of two orbits may be calculated from their inclinations to another plane using cosine rule for angles.

==Observations and theories==
Most planetary orbits in the Solar System have relatively small inclinations, both in relation to each other and to the Sun&#x27;s equator:

On the other hand, the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris have inclinations to the ecliptic of 17° and 44° respectively, and the large asteroid Pallas is inclined at 34°.

In 1966, Peter Goldreich published a classic paper on the evolution of the Moon&#x27;s orbit and on the orbits of other moons in the Solar System. He showed that, for each planet, there is a distance such that moons closer to the planet than that distance maintain an almost constant orbital inclination with respect to the planet&#x27;s equator (with an orbital precession mostly due to the tidal influence of the planet), whereas moons farther away maintain an almost constant orbital inclination with respect to the ecliptic (with precession due mostly to the tidal influence of the sun). The moons in the first category, with the exception of Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton, orbit near the equatorial plane. He concluded that these moons formed from equatorial accretion disks. But he found that the Moon, although it was once inside the critical distance from the Earth, never had an equatorial orbit as would be expected from various scenarios for its origin. This is called the lunar inclination problem, to which various solutions have since been proposed.

==Other meaning==
For planets and other rotating celestial bodies, the angle of the equatorial plane relative to the orbital plane – such as the tilt of the Earth&#x27;s poles toward or away from the Sun – is sometimes also called inclination, but less ambiguous terms are axial tilt or obliquity.

<doc id="56442" wikidata="Q4656430" url="?curid=56442" title="A Dictionary of Modern English Usage">
<text>A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926), by Henry Watson Fowler (1858–1933), is a style guide to British English usage and writing. It covers a wide range of topics that relate to usage, including: plurals, nouns, verbs, punctuation, cases, parentheses, quotation marks, the use of foreign terms, and so on. The dictionary became the standard for other style guides to writing in English. The 1926 first edition remains in print, along with the 1965 second edition, which is edited by Ernest Gowers, and was reprinted in 1983 and 1987. The 1996 third edition was re-titled as &quot;The New Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;, and revised in 2004, was mostly rewritten by Robert W. Burchfield, as a usage dictionary that incorporated corpus linguistics data; and the 2015 fourth edition, revised and re-titled &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot;, was edited by Jeremy Butterfield, as a usage dictionary. Informally, readers refer to the style guide and dictionary as Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage, Fowler, and Fowler&#x27;s.

==Linguistic approach==
&quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; encourages a direct, vigorous writing style, and opposes artificiality, by advising against convoluted sentence construction and the use of archaisms. It opposes pedantry, and ridicules artificial grammar rules unwarranted by natural English usage, such as bans on ending a sentence with a preposition, rules on the placement of the word &quot;only&quot;, and rules distinguishing between &quot;which&quot; and &quot;that&quot;. It classifies and condemns clichés. It discusses the terms &quot;battered ornament&quot;, &quot;vogue words&quot;, and &quot;worn-out humour&quot;, and defends useful distinctions between words whose meanings were coalescing in practice, thereby guiding the speaker and the writer away from illogical sentence construction, and the misuse of words. In the entries &quot;Pedantic Humour&quot; and &quot;Polysyllabic Humour&quot; Fowler is critical of the use of arcane words (archaisms) and the use of unnecessarily long words.

==Quotations==
Widely and often cited, &quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; is renowned for its witty passages, such as:
; Didacticism : The speaker who has discovered that &quot;Juan&quot; and &quot;Quixote&quot; are not pronounced in Spain as he used to pronounce them as a boy is not content to keep so important a piece of information to himself; he must have the rest of us call them &quot;Hwan&quot; and &quot;Kēhōtā&quot;; at any rate he will give us the chance of mending our ignorant ways by doing so.
; French Words : Display of superior knowledge is as great a vulgarity as display of superior wealth—greater indeed, inasmuch as knowledge should tend more definitely than wealth towards discretion and good manners.
; Inversion : Writers who observe the poignancy sometimes given by inversion, but fail to observe that &#x27;sometimes&#x27; means &#x27;when exclamation is appropriate&#x27;, adopt inversion as an infallible enlivener; they aim at freshness and attain frigidity.
; Split infinitive : The English-speaking world may be divided into (1) those who neither know nor care what a split infinitive is; (2) those who do not know, but care very much; (3) those who know and condemn; (4) those who know and approve; and (5) those who know and distinguish. ... Those who neither know nor care are the vast majority, and are a happy folk, to be envied by most of the minority classes.
; Terribly : It is strange that a people with such a fondness for understatement as the British should have felt the need to keep changing the adverbs by which they hope to convince listeners of the intensity of their feelings.
; True and false etymology : &quot;Welsh rabbit&quot; is amusing and right. &quot;Welsh rarebit&quot; is stupid and wrong.
==Editions==
Before writing &quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot;, Henry W. Fowler and his younger brother, Francis George Fowler (1871–1918), wrote and revised &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot; (1906), a grammar and usage guide. Assisted in the research by Francis, who died in 1918 of tuberculosis contracted (1915–16) whilst serving with the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War (1914–1918), Henry dedicated the first edition of the &quot;Dictionary&quot; to his late brother:

The first edition of &quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; was published in 1926, and then was reprinted with corrections in 1930, 1937, 1954, and in 2009, with an introduction and commentary by the linguist David Crystal. The second edition, titled &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;, was published in 1965, revised and edited by Ernest Gowers. The third edition, &quot;The New Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;, was published in 1996, edited by Robert Burchfield; and in 2004, Burchfield&#x27;s revision of the 1996 edition was published as &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;. The fourth edition, &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot;, was published in 2015, edited by Jeremy Butterfield.

The modernisation of &quot;A Dictionary of English Usage&quot; (1926) yielded the &quot;Pocket Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; (1999), edited by the lexicographer Robert Allen, which is based upon Burchfield&#x27;s 1996 edition; the modernised edition is a forty per cent abridgement realised with reduced-length entries and the omission of about half the entries of the 1996 edition. A second edition of Allen&#x27;s &quot;Pocket Fowler&quot; was published in 2008, the content of which the publisher said &quot;harks back to the original 1926 edition&quot;.

<doc id="56444" wikidata="Q83363" url="?curid=56444" title="Jeans">
<text>Jeans are a type of trousers made from denim or dungaree cloth. Often the term &quot;jeans&quot; refers to a particular style of trousers, called &quot;blue jeans&quot;, with the addition of copper pocket rivets added by Jacob W. Davis in 1871 and patented by Davis and Levi Strauss on May 20, 1873. Prior to the patent, the term &quot;blue jeans&quot; had been long in use for various garments (including trousers, overalls, and coats), constructed from blue-colored denim.

Originally designed for miners, modern jeans were popularized as casual wear by Marlon Brando and James Dean in their 1950s films, particularly &quot;The Wild One&quot; and &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, leading to the fabric becoming a symbol of rebellion among teenagers, especially members of the greaser subculture. From the 1960s onwards, jeans became common among various youth subcultures and subsequently young members of the general population. Nowadays, they are one of the most popular types of trousers in Western culture. Historic brands include Levi&#x27;s, Lee, and Wrangler.

== History ==
===Fabric ===
Research on the trade of jean fabric shows that it emerged in the cities of Genoa, Italy, and Nîmes, France. Gênes, the French word for Genoa, might be the origin of the word &quot;&quot;. In Nîmes, weavers tried to reproduce jean fabric but instead developed a similar twill fabric that became known as denim, &quot;de Nîmes&quot;, meaning &quot;from Nîmes&quot;. Genoa&#x27;s jeans fabric was a fustian textile of &quot;medium quality and of reasonable cost&quot;, very similar to cotton corduroy for which Genoa was famous, and was &quot;used for work clothes in general&quot;. The Genoese navy equipped its sailors with jeans, as they needed a fabric that could be worn wet or dry. Nîmes&#x27;s &quot;denim&quot; was coarser, considered higher quality, and was used &quot;for over garments such as smocks or overalls&quot;. In 1576, a quantity of &quot;jean fustians&quot; arrived into the port of Barnstaple on a vessel from Bristol. Nearly all indigo, needed for dyeing, came from indigo bush plantations in India until the late 19th century. It was replaced by indigo synthesis methods developed in Germany.
By the 17th century, jean was a crucial textile for working-class people in Northern Italy. This is seen in a series of genre paintings from around the 17th century attributed to an artist now referred to as the Master of the Blue Jeans. The ten paintings depict impoverished scenes with lower-class figures wearing a fabric that looks like denim. The fabric would have been Genoese jean, which was cheaper. Genre painting came to prominence in the late 16th century, and the non-nobility subject matter in all ten paintings places them among others that portray similar scenes.

Dungaree was mentioned for the first time in the 17th century, when it was referred to as cheap, coarse thick cotton cloth, often colored blue but sometimes white, worn by impoverished people in what was then a region of Bombay, India a dockside village called Dongri. This cloth was &quot;dungri&quot; in Hindi. Dungri was exported to England and used for manufacturing of cheap, robust working clothes. In English, the word &quot;dungri&quot; became pronounced as &quot;dungaree&quot;.

=== Rivets ===

The term &quot;jeans&quot; appears first in 1795, when a Swiss banker by the name Jean-Gabriel Eynard and his brother Jacques went to Genoa and both were soon heading a flourishing commercial concern. In 1800 Massena&#x27;s troops entered the town and Jean-Gabriel was entrusted with their supply. In particular he furnished them with uniforms cut from blue cloth called &quot;bleu de Genes&quot; whence later derives the famous garment known worldwide as &quot;blue jeans&quot;.

Levi Strauss, as a young man in 1851, went from Germany to New York to join his older brothers who ran a goods store. In 1853, he moved to San Francisco to open his own dry goods business. Jacob Davis was a tailor who often bought bolts of cloth from the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. wholesale house. In 1872, Davis wrote to Strauss asking to partner with him to patent and sell clothing reinforced with rivets. The copper rivets were to reinforce the points of stress, such as pocket corners and at the bottom of the button fly. Strauss accepted Davis&#x27;s offer, and the two men received US patent No. 139,121 for an &quot;Improvement in Fastening Pocket-Openings&quot; on May 20, 1873.
Davis and Strauss experimented with different fabrics. An early attempt was brown cotton duck, a bottom-weight fabric. Finding denim a more suitable material for work-pants, they began using it to manufacture their riveted pants. The denim used was produced by an American manufacturer. Popular legend incorrectly states that it was imported from Nîmes. A popular myth is that Strauss initially sold brown canvas pants to miners, later dyed them blue, turned to using denim, and only after Davis wrote to him, added rivets.

Initially, Strauss&#x27;s jeans were simply sturdy trousers worn by factory workers, miners, farmers, and cattlemen throughout the North American West. During this period, men&#x27;s jeans had the fly down the front, whereas women&#x27;s jeans had the fly down the left side. When Levi Strauss &amp; Co. patented the modern, mass-produced prototype in 1873, there were two pockets in the front and a patch pocket on the back right reinforced with copper rivets. The small riveted watch pocket was first added by Levi Strauss to their jeans in the late 1870s.

===20th century evolution===
In 1901, Levi Strauss added the back left pocket to their 501 model. This created the now familiar and industry-standard five-pocket configuration with two large pockets and small watch pocket in front with two pockets on the rear.

The popularity of &quot;waist overalls&quot;, as jeans were sometimes called, expanded during World War II. By the 1960s, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s jeans had the zipper down the front. Historic photographs indicate that in the decades before they became a staple of fashion, jeans generally fit quite loosely, much like a pair of bib overalls without the bib. Indeed, until 1960, Levi Strauss called its flagship product &quot;waist overalls&quot; rather than &quot;jeans&quot;.

After James Dean popularized them in the movie &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, wearing jeans became a symbol of youth rebellion during the 1950s. During the 1960s, the wearing of jeans became more acceptable, and by the 1970s it had become general fashion in the United States for casual wear. In Japan in 1977, a professor of Osaka University Philip Karl Pehda chastised a female student wearing jeans in the classroom. Then he was protested by the students, and a controversy arose in the country.

Examples of intentional denim distressing strictly to make them more fashionable can be seen as early as 1935 in Vogue&#x27;s June issue. Michael Belluomo, editor of &quot;Sportswear International Magazine&quot;, Oct/Nov 1987, p. 45, wrote that in 1965, Limbo, a boutique in the New York East Village, was &quot;the first retailer to wash a new pair of jeans to get a used, worn effect, and the idea became a hit.&quot; He continued, &quot;[Limbo] hired East Village artists to embellish the jeans with patches, decals, and other touches, and sold them for $200.&quot; In the early 1980s the denim industry introduced the stone-washing technique developed by GWG also known as &quot;Great Western Garment Co.&quot; Donald Freeland of Edmonton, Alberta, pioneered the method, which helped to bring denim to a larger and more versatile market. Acceptance of jeans continued through the 1980s and 1990s. Originally a utilitarian garment, jeans became a common fashion choice in the second half of the 20th century.

In the early 21st century, &quot;Details Men&#x27;s Style Manual&quot; devoted a chapter to jeans, saying, &quot;Now that jeans have become more acceptable cocktail-hour attire, you should probably own more than one pair.&quot; Calling Levi&#x27;s 501s &quot;an icon from the moment they were introduced,&quot; and &quot;the quintessential pair of jeans,&quot; the guidebook calls the standard straight leg design, &quot;a classic clean-cut &quot;American Graffiti&quot; look.&quot;

== Manufacturing processes ==

=== Dyeing ===

Traditionally, jeans were dyed to a blue color using natural indigo dye. Most denim is now dyed using synthetic indigo. Approximately 20 thousand tons of indigo are produced annually for this purpose, though only a few grams of the dye are required for each pair. For other colors of denim other dyes must be used. Currently, jeans are produced in any color that can be achieved with cotton.

For more information on dyeing, refer to denim and the discussion there of using pigment dyes.

=== Pre-shrinking ===
In 1962, Levi Strauss introduced their own pre-shrunk jeans (Lee and Wrangler jeans had already long been pre-shrunk); these did not shrink further after purchase, allowing the consumer to purchase a correctly fitting size. Pre-shrink is common in jeans nowadays. These jeans were known as the 505 regular fit jeans. The 505s are almost identical to the 501s with the exception of the button-fly. The Levi&#x27;s Corporation also introduced a slim boot-cut fit known as 517 and 527. The difference between the two is that the 517s sit at the waist line and the 527s sit below the waist line. Later, Levi&#x27;s would develop other styles and fits such as the loose, slim, comfort, relaxed, skinny, and a regular fit with a tapered leg.

=== Used and distressed looks ===
A significant amount of the aesthetic treatment of jeans may occur after the denim has been cut and sewn into the final garment. Many denim articles are washed to make them softer and to reduce or minimize shrinkage even beyond what sanforization prevents. Significantly washed denim can resemble dry denim which has faded naturally over extended use. Such distressing may be supplemented by chemical treatments or physical techniques such as stone washing.

The used or &quot;acid wash&quot; look is created by means of abrading the jeans or treating them with chemicals, such as acryl resin, phenol, a hypochlorite, potassium permanganate, caustic soda, acids etc.

Ripping or distressing of jeans, though also arising naturally as a result of wear and tear, is sometimes deliberately performed by suppliers—with distressed clothing sometimes selling for more than a nondistressed pair. For example, Pucci sold &quot;embellished mid-rise boyfriend jeans&quot; for £600 (US$860).

====Changes in appearance due to use====
Over time dry denim will fade, which is considered fashionable in some circumstances. During the process of wear, fading will usually occur on those parts of the article that receive the most stress. On a pair of jeans, this includes the upper thighs, the ankles, and the areas behind the knees. Patterns of fading in jeans caused by prolonged periods of wear include:
* honeycombs – meshes of faded line-segments that form behind the knees
* whiskers – faded streaks that form radially from the crotch area
* stacks – irregular bands of fading above the ankle caused by accordioning of the fabric due to contact with the foot or shoe
* train tracks – fading along the out-seams due to abrasion

===== Distressed jeans =====
Distressed denim emerged from the cultural punk movement in the 1970s. Early punks tore apart consumer goods as an expression of their anger towards capitalism and corporate greed.

Punks used safety pins in garments to encourage the youth to not buy endless, meaningless fashion, and thus fund corporations. Clothes manufacturers gentrified the notion by selling clothes with safety pins already in them, so the original meaning of punk was lost. Denim became a key target of this politically fueled deconstruction, with both men and women donning torn pants and jackets, accessorized with safety pins and slogans. 

The trend became popular again in the 1990s with the emergence of grunge fashion. The grunge youth wore loose-fitting ripped jeans, flannel shirts or woolen Pendletons layered over T-shirts. Their anti-conformist approach to fashion led to the popularization of the casual chic look, a trend which continued into the 2000s.

=== Environmental and humanitarian impact ===
A typical pair of blue jeans uses of water during its life cycle. This includes the water to irrigate the cotton crop, manufacture the jeans, and the numerous washes by the consumer. During production, the typical amount for washing with traditional Pullman machines reaches 90 litres per jeans, which can be reduced to about 27 litres using modern frontloaders. Novel washing processes such as Droptima can reduce that to 6 litres fresh water plus 4 litres used water.

The production of jeans with a &quot;used look&quot; can be more environmentally damaging than regular jeans, depending on how the waste compounds are processed. Sandblasting and treating with sandpaper has the risk of causing silicosis to the workers, and in Turkey, more than 5,000 textile workers have been stricken with this disease, and 46 people are known to have died. Some companies have announced they are banning the use of sandblasting.

== Care and wear ==
Despite most jeans being &quot;pre-shrunk&quot;, they are still sensitive to slight further shrinkage and loss of color from being washed. The Levi Strauss company recommends avoiding washing jeans as much as possible. These and other suggestions to avoid washing jeans where possible have encountered criticism. Cory Warren, editor of &quot;LS&amp;Co. Unzipped&quot;, clarifies in a response to such a criticism:

For those who prefer to refrain from washing their jeans there have been suggestions to freeze them in order to kill the germs that cause odor. However, this advice has been proven ineffective.

== Legal cases ==
===Italian rape trial===
In Rome, Italy, in 1992, a 45-year-old driving instructor was accused of rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told her that if she was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act consensual (&quot;because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them... and by removing the jeans... it was no longer rape but consensual sex&quot;). The court stated in its decision &quot;it is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.&quot;

The ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans and holding placards that read &quot;Jeans: An Alibi for Rape&quot;. As a sign of support, the California Senate and the California Assembly followed suit. Patricia Giggans, the executive director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women (now Peace Over Violence) soon made Denim Day an annual event. at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. Wearing jeans on that day has become an international symbol of protest against such attitudes about sexual assault. In 2008 the Supreme Court of Cassation overturned the ruling, so there is no longer a &quot;denim&quot; defense to the charge of rape.

===Rokotov-Faibishenko case===

In 1957, during the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Moscow, Soviet Union (present-day Russia), Western-made jeans were first introduced to the communist state and sparked &quot;jeans fever&quot; at the time. People preferred to wear Western-made blue jeans rather than local-made black ones. In Soviet ideology, such an action challenged communist-made jeans and symbolized Western victory. In 1961, two ringleaders, Y. T. Rokotov and V. P. Faibishenko, were caught with their group for smuggling currencies from other countries along with blue jeans and other contraband. Under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev, the duo were executed.

== Trends==
=== Worldwide market for jeans ===
North America accounts for 39% of global purchases for jeans, followed by Western Europe at 20%, Japan and Korea at 10% and the rest of the world at 31%.

United States consumers spent more than US$14 billion on jeans in 2004 and US$15 billion in 2005. US consumers bought US$13.8 billion of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s jeans in the year that ended April 30, 2011 (~$ in ), according to market-research firm NPD Group.

=== Soviet Union ===

In the Soviet Union, jeans were the symbol of the Western way of life. The &quot;jeans fever&quot; in the USSR started in 1957 during the World Festival of Youth and Students. According to a 1961 Soviet textile dictionary, jeans were initially referred to as a &quot;worker&#x27;s uniform&quot; (рабочий костюм, &quot;rabochii kostyum&quot;).

The jeans brand Rokotov and Fainberg is named after the defendants in the Rokotov–Faibishenko case, Yan T. Rokotov and Vladislav P. Faibishenko, who were executed for, among other things, trafficking in jeans.

Although not outright banned, jeans were hard to come by in the Soviet Union since they were seen as a symbol of rebellion by the Soviet youth, who wanted to emulate the style of film and rock stars of the West. The Soviet government resisted supplying the market with jeans as it would mean responding to the market, a capitalist principle. People went to great lengths, sometimes by resorting to violence and other illegal activities, to obtain real Western-made jeans. That led to the creation of black markets and to the bootlegging of jeans, which since has become an important cultural element of the history of the Soviet Union.

=== Market-share shift to activewear ===
In 2014, teens were buying more fashion and athleisure clothing from brands such as Nike and Lululemon over denim classics from brands like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Activewear in 2014 comprised 28% of teens&#x27; apparel purchases, up from 6% in 2008. In 2014, Nike, Lululemon, Under Armour, and Adidas were the most popular brands for athletic apparel among teen consumers. Fashion retailers have begun to adjust their offerings accordingly. Bloomberg reports that Levi&#x27;s stuck to its core product (denim) instead of adapting to consumer trends. As a result, Levi&#x27;s sales decreased from over US$7 billion to US$4.8 billion in 2015.

In February 2021, it was found that sales for athleisure had risen by 84% since March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 lockdowns.

==Variations on the basic type==
* Cigarette: Designed to fit quite closely, but not tightly, to the thigh area, with a less close fit to the calf
* Cropped: Where the leg is cut to a lesser length, to somewhere above the ankle
* Relaxed
* Skinny: Worn to flatter the figure in the fashion of tight or close fitting
* Wide-leg; or with cropped variant: The waist line rides up past the wearer&#x27;s actual waist, material below the knee is altogether away from the leg and descends as a straight line, standard type descends down to the ankle; cropped variant: the leg ceases at the lower leg mid-way down (or stops further down toward the ankle)
* Mom/Mum: Jeans which have a high waist (above the belly button), and are loose around the thighs, with a somewhat tapered fit.
* Straight-leg: Jeans which are the same width at the leg opening as they are at the bottom of the leg, making for a slightly baggy fit.
* Boyfriend: Often with a mid-low waist, boyfriend jeans have a baggy, &quot;borrowed from the boys&quot; fit.
* Flared, or bell-bottomed: Often fitted around the thigh area, then become wider from the knee down.
* High-waisted jeans were first popularized in the 1970s, but they have seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years. High-waisted jeans are characterized by a high rise that sits above the belly button. They can be fitted, relaxed, or loose-fitting, and they come in a variety of washes and colors.

=== Low-rise jeans ===
Media reported in 2017 that the trend of low-rise jeans, famous in the 1990s and 2000s, was coming back into fashion due to a sparked by an interest in Y2K style.

In the early 2000s, low-rise jeans were commonly seen on celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Paris Hilton, Gwen Stefani and Christina Aguilera, attributing to the Y2K style. In 2021, online searches for &#x27;y2k fashion&#x27; had risen by 193%, showing that the fashion style was making a comeback, and low-rise jeans were becoming a common clothing item for teenagers and young adults. 

Low-rise jeans usually come or more below the navel. Manufactured low-rise jeans have a shorter rise (distance between the waistband and crotch seam). The low-rise look can also be accomplished by letting jeans with longer rises fall lower than they are meant to. This is a less extreme version of sagging, which was popularized by male hip-hop artists in the 1990s.

<text>Theo Wade Brown (26 May 1950 – 30 April 2002) was an English carpenter, designer and engineer.

Brown was also a bon viveur, amateur musician and genuine eccentric. With his handlebar moustache and long red hair, he was an unmistakable figure.

Brown was a well-known member of the London film special effects community, and one of the core team at the Computer Film Company that won a Scientific and Technical Academy Award for developing digital film technology.

Brown later designed the Northlight film scanner for the Computer Film Company scanner division (now Filmlight), and was responsible not only for its remarkable engineering design, but also its 1920s-style marble and steel appearance—an artistic flourish that was characteristic of Brown&#x27;s approach to life.

Brown suffered from bipolar disorder which led eventually to his death.

In 2010, he was posthumously awarded a Scientific and Technical Academy Award for his work at Filmlight on the Northlight scanner technology.

Main road transportations are provided by the European route E4. The Örnsköldsvik Airport provides daily flights to and from the Stockholm-Arlanda Airport courtesy of Höga Kusten Flyg, and also charter flights to Turkey courtesy of Pegasus Airlines. Railway transportation will in the future be provided by high-speed railway Botniabanan, which is currently under construction. There is also a harbour, where cargo ships load and unload timber and other merchandise. In North America the town is known for its excellent hockey players, a number of whom play with the NHL.

== Recreation and sports ==
Due to the hilly surroundings, hiking and exploring the scenery of the High Coast is popular in the area. In the wintertime, skiing is popular. Both cross-country skiing, alpine skiing and even ski jumping is practiced almost in the downtown area. Since Örnsköldsvik is a coastal town, there are also beaches near town, as well as campsites. There&#x27;s also an indoor water park called Paradisbadet, with one of the longest water slides in Europe.

Sports is also popular, the main spectator sport in town is ice hockey, with the local team Modo Hockey in Swedish Hockey League, the main league for ice hockey in Sweden. The local football teams are not quite as successful, but still pretty popular, on the men&#x27;s side especially the teams Friska Viljor FC from central Örnsköldsvik and Anundsjö IF from Bredbyn outside of town, and women&#x27;s Själevads IK. A couple floorball teams from town have also had some success.

==Notable people==
Örnsköldsvik is the birthplace of many world-famous ice hockey players, including Nils Johansson, Per Svartvadet, Peter Forsberg, Markus Näslund, Niklas Sundström, Andreas Salomonsson, Magnus Wernblom, Mattias Timander, Victor Hedman, Tobias Enström, and the twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin. The Sedin twins were top players for the Vancouver Canucks, and Hedman plays for the Tampa Bay Lightning. Many stars from hockey&#x27;s previous generation, including Anders Hedberg, Thomas Gradin, and Anders Kallur were also either Örnsköldsvik natives (Hedberg) and/or played in the town for the Modo Hockey club.
