<text>The Hurrians (; ; also called Hari, Khurrites, Hourri, Churri, Hurri) were a people who inhabited the Ancient Near East during the Bronze Age. They spoke the Hurrian language, and lived throughout northern Syria, upper Mesopotamia and southeastern Anatolia.

The Hurrians were first documented in the city of Urkesh, where they built their first kingdom. Their largest and most influential Hurrian kingdom was Mitanni. The population of the Hittite Empire in Anatolia included a large population of Hurrians, and there is significant Hurrian influence in Hittite mythology. By the Early Iron Age, the Hurrians had been assimilated with other peoples. The state of Urartu later covered some of the same area. A related people to the Hurrians are the Urartians.

==History==
===Early Bronze Age===

The Khabur River valley became the heart of the Hurrian lands for a millennium. The first known Hurrian kingdom emerged around the city of Urkesh (modern Tell Mozan) during the third millennium BC. There is evidence that they were initially allied with the Akkadian Empire of Mesopotamia, indicating they had a firm hold on the area by the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2254–2218 BC). A king of Urkesh with the Hurrian name Tupkish had a queen with the name Uqnitum, Akkadian for &quot;girl of lapis lazuli&quot;.

===Middle Bronze Age===
Hurrian names occur sporadically in northwestern Mesopotamia and the area of Kirkuk in modern Iraq by the Middle Bronze Age. Their presence was attested at Nuzi, Urkesh and other sites. They eventually occupied a broad arc of fertile farmland stretching from the Khabur River valley in the west to the foothills of the Zagros Mountains in the east. By this point, during the Old Babylonian period in the early second millennium BC, the Amorite kingdom of Mari to the south had subdued Urkesh and made it a vassal state. Urkesh later became a Mitanni religious center.

The Hurrians also migrated further west in this period. By 1725 BC they are found also in parts of northern Syria, such as Alalakh. The mixed Amorite–Hurrian kingdom of Yamhad is recorded as struggling for this area with the early Hittite king Hattusilis I around 1600 BC. Hurrians also settled in the coastal region of Adaniya in the country of Kizzuwatna, southern Anatolia. Yamhad eventually weakened vis-a-vis the powerful Hittites, but this also opened Anatolia for Hurrian cultural influences. The Hittites were influenced by both the Hurrian cultures over the course of several centuries.

The city of Shibaniba (Tell Billa) may have also played an important role at that time. Possible Hurrian occupation was identified at Tell Billa during the middle of the second millennium BC. In 2022 Tell Billa was proposed as the possible site of the city of Šimānum (possibly known as Asimānum during the Akkadian Empire). Šimānum was important during the Ur III period (ca 2100 BC).

===Late Bronze Age===

The Mitanni Empire was a strong regional power limited by the Hittites to the north, Egyptians to the southwest, Kassites to the southeast, and later by the Assyrians to the east. At its maximum extent Mitanni ranged as far as west as Kizzuwatna by the Taurus mountains, Tunip in the south, Arraphe in the east, and north to Lake Van. Their sphere of influence is shown in spread Hurrian place names, personal names. Eventually, after an internal succession crisis, Mitanni fell to the Hittites, later to fall under the control of the Assyrians.

The Hurrian entity of Mitanni, which first rose to power before 1550 BC, was first mentioned in the records of Egyptian pharaohs Thutmose I (1506–1493 BC) and Thutmose III (1479–1425 BC), the later most notably associated with the Battle of Megiddo in that pharaoh&#x27;s 22 regnal year. Most of the time Egyptians referred to the kingdom as Naharin. Later, Mitanni and Hanigalbat (the Assyrian name for Mitanni) are mentioned in the Amarna Letters during the time of Pharaoh Akhenaten (1353–1336 BC). Domestically, Mitanni records have been found at a number of places in the region including several Hittite sites as well as Tell Bazi, Alalakh, Nuzi, Mardaman, Kemune, and Müslümantepe among others.

Another major center of Hurrian influence was the kingdom of Arrapha. Excavations at Yorgan Tepe, ancient Nuzi, proved this to be one of the most important sites for our knowledge about the Hurrians. Hurrian kings such as Ithi-Teshup and Ithiya ruled over Arrapha, yet by the mid-fifteenth century BC they had become vassals of the Great King of Mitanni.

===Urartu===
At the end of the second millennium BC the Urartians around Lake Van and Mount Ararat rose in power forming the Kingdom of Urartu. During the 11th and 10th centuries BC, the kingdom eventually encompassed a region stretching from the Caucasus Mountains in the north, to the borders of northern Assyria and northern Ancient Iran in the south, and controlled much of eastern Anatolia. Some scientists consider Urartu to be a re-consolidation of earlier Hurrian populations mainly due to linguistic factors, but this view is not universally held.

=== Shubaru/Shubria ===
After the destruction of Mitanni by the Hittites around 1350-1325 BC, the term &quot;Shubaru&quot; was used in Assyrian sources to refer to the remnants of the Mitanni in the upper Tigris valley. The Shubaru people revolted against the Assyrians multiple times in the last centuries of the second millennium BC. The term is related to &quot;Shubria&quot;, the name of a country located north of the upper Tigris River valley. Shubria was located between Urartu and Assyria and existed as an independent kingdom until its conquest by Assyria in 673–672 BC. The Shubrians worshipped the Hurrian deity Teshub, and several Shubrian names have Hurrian origins. Hurrians formed part of the Shubrian population and may have been the predominant group. Some scholars have suggested that Shubria was the last remnant of Hurrian civilization, or even constituted the original homeland of the Hurrians. Karen Radner writes that Shubria &quot;can certainly be described as [a] (linguistically and culturally) Hurrian&quot; state. According to Radner, a letter from the king of Shubria to an Assyrian magnate from the time of Sargon II was composed in the Hurrian language.

==Culture and society==
Knowledge of Hurrian culture relies on archaeological excavations at sites such as Nuzi and Alalakh as well as on cuneiform tablets, primarily from Hattusa (Boghazköy), the capital of the Hittites, whose civilization was greatly influenced by the Hurrians. Tablets from Nuzi, Alalakh, and other cities with Hurrian populations (as shown by personal names) reveal Hurrian cultural features even though they were written in Akkadian. Hurrian cylinder seals were carefully carved and often portrayed mythological motifs. They are a key to the understanding of Hurrian culture and history.

The 2nd millennium Hurrians were masterful ceramists. Their pottery is commonly found in Mesopotamia and in the lands west of the Euphrates; it was highly valued in distant Egypt, by the time of the New Kingdom. Archaeologists use the terms Khabur ware and Nuzi ware for two types of wheel-made pottery used by the Hurrians. Khabur ware is characterized by reddish painted lines with a geometric triangular pattern and dots, while Nuzi ware has very distinctive forms, and are painted in brown or black. They were also skilled at glass working.

The Hurrians had a reputation in metallurgy. It is proposed that the Sumerian term for &quot;coppersmith&quot; &quot;tabira&quot;/&quot;tibira&quot; was borrowed from Hurrian, which would imply an early presence of the Hurrians way before their first historical mention in Akkadian sources. Copper was traded south to Mesopotamia from the highlands of Anatolia. The Khabur Valley had a central position in the metal trade, and copper, silver and even tin were accessible from the Hurrian-dominated countries Kizzuwatna and Ishuwa situated in the Anatolian highland. Gold was in short supply, and the Amarna letters inform us that it was acquired from Egypt. Not many examples of Hurrian metal work have survived, except from the later Urartu. Some small fine bronze lion foundation pegs were discovered at Urkesh.

Among the Hurrian texts from Ugarit are the oldest known instances of written music, dating from c. 1400 BC. Among these fragments are found the names of four Hurrian composers, Tapšiẖuni, Puẖiya(na), Urẖiya, and Ammiya.

==Religion==

The Hurrian culture made a great impact on the religion of the Hittites. From the Hurrian cult centre at Kummanni in Kizzuwatna, Hurrian religion spread to the Hittite people. Syncretism merged the Old Hittite and Hurrian religions. Hurrian religion spread to Syria, where Baal became the counterpart of Teshub. The Hurrian religion, in different forms, influenced the entire ancient Near East, except ancient Egypt and southern Mesopotamia.

While the Hurrian and Urartian languages are related, there is little similarity between corresponding systems of belief.


The main gods in the Hurrian pantheon were:
* Teshub, &quot;Teshup&quot;, the mighty weather god.
* Hebat, &quot;Hepa&quot;, his wife, the mother goddess, later equated with the main sun goddess of the Hittites
* Sarruma, &quot;Šarruma&quot;, their son, a mountain god of Syrian origin.
* Kumarbi, grain god, the father of Teshub and a &quot;father of gods&quot; similar to Enlil; his home as described in mythology is the city of Urkesh.
* Shaushka, &quot;Šauska&quot;, the Hurrian counterpart of Ishtar, and a goddess of love, war and healing.
* Shimegi, &quot;Šimegi&quot;, the sun god.
* Kushuh, &quot;Kušuh&quot;, the moon god and a guardian of oaths. Symbols of the sun and the crescent moon appear joined together in the Hurrian iconography.
* Nergal, a Sumerian deity of the netherworld, who had a prominent temple in Urkesh in the earliest period of recorded Hurrian history. Possibly a stand-in for a god whose Hurrian name is presently unknown.
* Ea, &quot;Hayya&quot;, the god of wisdom, who was also Sumerian in origin.
* Allani, goddess of the netherworld.
* Ishara, a goddess of Syrian origin.
* Aštabi, a war god. 
* Nupatik, a prominent god of uncertain function.
* Hutena and Hutellura, fate and birth goddesses.

Hurrian cylinder seals often depict mythological creatures such as winged humans or animals, dragons and other monsters. The interpretation of these depictions of gods and demons remains uncertain. They may have been both protective and evil spirits. Some are reminiscent of the Assyrian shedu.

The Hurrian gods do not appear to have had particular home temples, like in the Mesopotamian or Ancient Egyptian religion. Some important cult centres were Kummanni in Kizzuwatna and Hittite Yazilikaya. Harran was at least later a religious centre for the moon god, and Shauskha had an important temple in Nineve, when the city was under Hurrian rule. A temple of Nergal was built in Urkesh in the late third millennium BC. The town of Kahat was a religious centre in the kingdom of Mitanni.

The Hurrian myth &quot;The Songs of Ullikummi&quot;, preserved among the Hittites, is a parallel to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;; the castration of Uranus by Cronus may be derived from the castration of Anu by Kumarbi, while Zeus&#x27;s overthrow of Cronus and Cronus&#x27;s regurgitation of the swallowed gods is like the Hurrian myth of Teshub and Kumarbi. It has been argued that the worship of Attis drew on Hurrian myth.

==Language==

The agglutinating and highly ergative Hurrian language is related to the Urartian language, the language of the ancient kingdom of Urartu. Together they form the Hurro-Urartian language family. The external connections of the Hurro-Urartian languages are disputed. There exist various proposals for a genetic relationship to other language families (e.g., the Northeast Caucasian languages), but none of these are generally accepted.

The Hurrians adopted the Akkadian language and Cuneiform script for their own writing about 2000 BC. Texts in the Hurrian language in cuneiform have been found at Hattusa, Ugarit (Ras Shamra), as well as in one of the longest of the Amarna letters (EA 27), written by King Tushratta of Mitanni to Pharaoh Amenhotep III. It was the only long Hurrian text known until a multi-tablet collection of literature in Hurrian with a Hittite translation was discovered at Hattusa in 1983.

==Archaeology==
Hurrian settlements are distributed over three modern countries, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. The heart of the Hurrian world is bisected by the modern border between Syria and Turkey. Several sites are situated within the border zone, making access for excavations problematic. A threat to the ancient sites are the many dam projects in the Euphrates, Tigris and Khabur valleys. Several rescue operations have already been undertaken when the construction of dams put entire river valleys under water.

The first major excavations of Hurrian sites in Iraq and Syria began in the 1920s and 1930s. They were led by the American archaeologist Edward Chiera at Yorghan Tepe (Nuzi), and the British archaeologist Max Mallowan at Chagar Bazar and Tell Brak. Recent excavations and surveys in progress are conducted by American, Belgian, Danish, Dutch, French, German and Italian teams of archaeologists, with international participants, in cooperation with the Syrian Department of Antiquities. The tells, or city mounds, often reveal a long occupation beginning in the Neolithic and ending in the Roman period or later. The characteristic Hurrian pottery, the Khabur ware, is helpful in determining the different strata of occupation within the mounds. The Hurrian settlements are usually identified from the Middle Bronze Age to the end of the Late Bronze Age, with Tell Mozan (Urkesh) being the main exception.

<text>Thornton Niven Wilder (April 17, 1897 – December 7, 1975) was an American playwright and novelist (and occasional actor in his own plays.) He won three Pulitzer Prizes, for the novel &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; and for the plays &quot;Our Town&quot; and &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, and a U.S. National Book Award for the novel &quot;The Eighth Day&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Wilder was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of Amos Parker Wilder, a newspaper editor and later a U.S. diplomat, and Isabella Thornton Niven.

Wilder had four siblings as well as a twin who was stillborn. All of the surviving Wilder children spent part of their childhood in China when their father was stationed in Hong Kong and Shanghai as U.S. Consul General. Thornton&#x27;s older brother, Amos Niven Wilder, became Hollis Professor of Divinity at the Harvard Divinity School. He was a noted poet and was instrumental in developing the field of theopoetics. Their sister Isabel Wilder was an accomplished writer. They had two more sisters, Charlotte Wilder, a poet, and Janet Wilder Dakin, a zoologist.

==Education==

Wilder began writing plays while at the Thacher School in Ojai, California, where he did not fit in and was teased by classmates as overly intellectual. According to a classmate, &quot;We left him alone, just left him alone. And he would retire at the library, his hideaway, learning to distance himself from humiliation and indifference.&quot; His family lived for a time in China, where his sister Janet was born in 1910. He attended the English China Inland Mission Chefoo School at Yantai, but returned with his mother and siblings to California in 1912 because of the unstable political conditions in China at the time. Thornton graduated from Berkeley High School in 1915.

Wilder served a three-month enlistment in the U.S. Army&#x27;s Coast Artillery Corps at Fort Adams in Rhode Island during World War I, eventually rising to the rank of corporal. He attended Oberlin College before earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1920 at Yale University, where he refined his writing skills as a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, a literary society. He earned his Master of Arts degree in French literature from Princeton University in 1926.

==Career==

After graduating, Wilder went to Italy and studied archaeology and Italian (1920–21) as part of an eight-month residency at The American Academy in Rome, and then taught French at the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, beginning in 1921. His first novel, &quot;The Cabala&quot;, was published in 1926. In 1927, &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; brought him commercial success and his first Pulitzer Prize (1928). He resigned from the Lawrenceville School in 1928. From 1930 to 1937, he taught at the University of Chicago, during which time he published his translation of André Obey&#x27;s own adaptation of the tale &quot;Le Viol de Lucrece&quot; (1931) under the title &quot;Lucrece&quot; (Longmans Green, 1933). In Chicago, he became famous as a lecturer and was chronicled on the celebrity pages. In 1938, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his play &quot;Our Town&quot;, and he won the prize again in 1943 for his play &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;.

World War II saw Wilder rise to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Air Force Intelligence, first in Africa, then in Italy until 1945. He received several awards for his military service. He went on to be a visiting professor at Harvard University, where he served for a year as the Charles Eliot Norton professor. Though he considered himself a teacher first and a writer second, he continued to write all his life, receiving the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1957 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963. In 1968 he won the National Book Award for his novel &quot;The Eighth Day&quot;.

Proficient in four languages, Wilder translated plays by André Obey and Jean-Paul Sartre. He wrote the libretti of two operas, &quot;The Long Christmas Dinner&quot;, composed by Paul Hindemith, and &quot;The Alcestiad&quot;, composed by Louise Talma and based on his own play. Alfred Hitchcock, whom he admired, asked him to write the screenplay of his thriller &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, and he completed a first draft for the film.

&quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; (1927) tells the story of several unrelated people who happen to be on a bridge in Peru when it collapses, killing them. Philosophically, the book explores the question of why unfortunate events occur to people who seem &quot;innocent&quot; or &quot;undeserving&quot;. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928, and in 1998 it was selected by the editorial board of the American Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of the twentieth century. The book was quoted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair during the memorial service for victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Since then its popularity has grown enormously. The book is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and film-making, where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks to events before the disaster.

Wilder wrote &quot;Our Town&quot;, a popular play (and later film) set in fictional Grover&#x27;s Corners, New Hampshire. It was inspired in part by Dante&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot; and in part by his friend Gertrude Stein&#x27;s novel &quot;The Making of Americans&quot;. Wilder suffered from writer&#x27;s block while writing the final act. &quot;Our Town&quot; employs a choric narrator called the Stage Manager and a minimalist set to underscore the human experience. Wilder himself played the Stage Manager on Broadway for two weeks and later in summer stock productions. Following the daily lives of the Gibbs and Webb families, as well as the other inhabitants of Grover&#x27;s Corners, the play illustrates the importance of the universality of the simple, yet meaningful lives of all people in the world in order to demonstrate the value of appreciating life. The play won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize.

In 1938, Max Reinhardt directed a Broadway production of &quot;The Merchant of Yonkers&quot;, which Wilder had adapted from Austrian playwright Johann Nestroy&#x27;s &quot;Einen Jux will er sich machen&quot; (1842). It was a failure, closing after 39 performances.

His play &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; opened in New York on November 18, 1942, featuring Fredric March and Tallulah Bankhead. Again, the themes are familiar – the timeless human condition; history as progressive, cyclical, or entropic; literature, philosophy, and religion as the touchstones of civilization. Three acts dramatize the travails of the Antrobus family, allegorizing the alternate history of mankind. It was claimed by Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson, authors of &quot;A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake&quot;, that much of the play was the result of unacknowledged borrowing from James Joyce&#x27;s last work.

In his novel &quot;The Ides of March&quot; (1948), Wilder reconstructed the characters and events leading to, and culminating in, the assassination of Julius Caesar. He had met Jean-Paul Sartre on a U.S. lecture tour after the war, and was under the influence of existentialism, although rejecting its atheist implications.

In 1954, Tyrone Guthrie encouraged Wilder to rework &quot;The Merchant of Yonkers&quot; into &quot;The Matchmaker&quot;. This time the play opened in 1955 and enjoyed a healthy Broadway run of 486 performances with Ruth Gordon in the title role, winning a Tony Award for Guthrie, its director. It became the basis for the hit 1964 musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, with a book by Michael Stewart and score by Jerry Herman.

In 1960, Wilder was awarded the first ever Edward MacDowell Medal by The MacDowell Colony for outstanding contributions to American culture.

In 1962 and 1963, Wilder lived for 20 months in the small town of Douglas, Arizona, apart from family and friends. There he started his longest novel, &quot;The Eighth Day&quot;, which went on to win the National Book Award. According to Harold Augenbraum in 2009, it &quot;attack[ed] the big questions head on, ... [embedded] in the story of small-town America&quot;.

His last novel, &quot;Theophilus North&quot;, was published in 1973, and made into the film &quot;Mr. North&quot; in 1988.

The Library of America republished all of Wilder&#x27;s plays in 2007, together with some of his writings on the theater and the screenplay of &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;. In 2009, a second volume was released, containing his first five novels, six early stories, and four essays on fiction. Finally, the third and final volume in the Library of America series on Wilder was released in 2011, containing his last two novels &quot;The Eighth Day&quot; and &quot;Theophilus North&quot;, as well as four autobiographical sketches.

==Personal life==
Six years after Wilder&#x27;s death, Samuel Steward wrote in his autobiography that he had sexual relations with him. In 1937, Gertrude Stein had given Steward, then a college professor, a letter of introduction to Wilder. According to Steward, Alice B. Toklas told him that Wilder liked him and that Wilder had reported he was having trouble starting the third act of &quot;Our Town&quot; until he and Steward walked around Zürich all night in the rain and the next day wrote the whole act, opening with a crowd in a rainy cemetery. Penelope Niven disputes Steward&#x27;s claim of a relationship with Wilder and, based on Wilder&#x27;s correspondence, says Wilder worked on the third act of &quot;Our Town&quot; over the course of several months and completed it several months before he first met Steward. Robert Gottlieb, reviewing Penelope Niven&#x27;s work in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2013, claimed Wilder had become infatuated with a man, not identified by Gottlieb, and Wilder&#x27;s feelings were not reciprocated. Gottlieb asserted that &quot;Niven ties herself in knots in her discussion of Wilder&#x27;s confusing sexuality&quot; and that &quot;His interest in women was unshakably nonsexual.&quot; He takes Steward&#x27;s view that Wilder was a latent homosexual but never comfortable with sex.

Wilder had a wide circle of friends, including writers Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald, Toklas, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Stein; actress Ruth Gordon; fighter Gene Tunney; and socialite Sibyl, Lady Colefax.

From the earnings of &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot;, in 1930 Wilder had a house built for his family in Hamden, Connecticut, designed by Alice Trythall Washburn, one of the few female architects working at the time. His sister Isabel lived there for the rest of her life. This became his home base, although he traveled extensively and lived away for significant periods.

==Death==
Wilder died of heart failure in his Hamden, Connecticut, house on December 7, 1975, at age 78. He is interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hamden.

<doc id="51685" wikidata="Q465800" url="?curid=51685" title="Auxiliary verb">
<text>An auxiliary verb (abbreviated ) is a verb that adds functional or grammatical meaning to the clause in which it occurs, so as to express tense, aspect, modality, voice, emphasis, etc. Auxiliary verbs usually accompany an infinitive verb or a participle, which respectively provide the main semantic content of the clause. An example is the verb &quot;have&quot; in the sentence &quot;I have finished my lunch.&quot; Here, the auxiliary &quot;have&quot; helps to express the perfect aspect along with the participle, &quot;finished&quot;. Some sentences contain a chain of two or more auxiliary verbs. Auxiliary verbs are also called helping verbs, helper verbs, or (verbal) auxiliaries. Research has been conducted into split inflection in auxiliary verbs.

==Basic examples==
Below are some sentences that contain representative auxiliary verbs from English, Spanish, German and French, with the auxiliary verb marked in bold:

::a. Do you want tea? 

::b. She has given her best shot. 

::c. He cogido tu lápiz. 
:::(I) have grabbed your pencil = &#x27;I have taken your pencil.&#x27;

::d. Das wurde mehrmals gesagt. 
:::That became many times said = &#x27;That was said many times.&#x27;

::e. Sie ist nach Hause gegangen. 
:::She is to home gone = &#x27;She went home/She has gone home.&#x27;

::f. J″ai vu le soleil. 
:::I have seen the sun = &#x27;I have seen the sun/I saw the sun.&#x27;

::g. Nous sommes hébergés par un ami. 
:::We are hosted by a friend.

These auxiliaries help express a question, show tense/aspect, or form passive voice. Auxiliaries like these typically appear with a full verb that carries the main semantic content of the clause.

==Traits across languages==
Auxiliary verbs typically help express grammatical tense, aspect, mood, and voice. They generally appear together with an infinitive. The auxiliary is said to &quot;help&quot; the infinitive. The auxiliary verbs of a language form a closed class, i.e., there is a fixed, relatively small number of them.

Widely acknowledged verbs that can serve as auxiliaries in English and many related languages are the equivalents of &quot;be&quot; to express passive voice, and &quot;have&quot; (and sometimes &quot;be&quot;) to express perfect aspect or past time reference.

In some treatments, the copula &quot;be&quot; is classed as an auxiliary even though it does not &quot;help&quot; another verb, e.g.,

::The bird is in the tree. 

Definitions of auxiliary verbs are not always consistent across languages, or even among authors discussing the same language. Modal verbs may or may not be classified as auxiliaries, depending on the language. In the case of English, verbs are often identified as auxiliaries based on their grammatical behavior, as described below. In some cases, verbs that function similarly to auxiliaries, but are not considered full members of that class (perhaps because they carry some independent lexical information), are called &quot;semi-auxiliaries&quot;. In French, for example, verbs such as &quot;devoir&quot; (have to), &quot;pouvoir&quot; (be able to), &quot;aller&quot; (be going to), &quot;vouloir&quot; (want), &quot;faire&quot; (make), and &quot;laisser&quot; (let), when used together with the infinitive of another verb, can be called semi-auxiliaries. There has also been a study on auxiliary verb constructions in Dravidian languages.

==English==

The following sections consider auxiliary verbs in English. They list auxiliary verbs, then present the diagnostics that motivate this special class (subject-auxiliary inversion and negation with &quot;not&quot;). The modal verbs are included in this class, due to their behavior with respect to these diagnostics.

===List of auxiliaries in English===
A list of verbs that (can) function as auxiliaries in English is as follows:

::&quot;be&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;dare&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;have&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;might&quot;, &quot;must&quot;, &quot;need&quot;, &quot;ought&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, &quot;would&quot;

The status of &quot;dare (not)&quot;, &quot;need (not)&quot;, and &quot;ought (to)&quot; is debatable and the use of these verbs as auxiliaries can vary across dialects of English. If the negative forms &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;won&#x27;t&quot;, etc. are viewed as separate verbs (and not as contractions), then the number of auxiliaries increases. The verbs &quot;do&quot; and &quot;have&quot; can also function as full verbs or as light verbs, which can be a source of confusion about their status. The modal verbs (&quot;can&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;might&quot;, &quot;must&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, &quot;would&quot;, and &quot;dare&quot;, &quot;need&quot; and &quot;ought&quot; when included) form a subclass of auxiliary verbs. Modal verbs are defective insofar as they cannot be inflected, nor do they appear as gerunds, infinitives, or participles.

The following table summarizes the auxiliary verbs in standard English and the meaning contribution to the clauses in which they appear. Many auxiliary verbs are listed more than once in the table based upon discernible differences in use.

Deontic modality expresses an ability, necessity, or obligation that is associated with an agent subject. Epistemic modality expresses the speaker&#x27;s assessment of reality or likelihood of reality. Distinguishing between the two types of modality can be difficult, since many sentences contain a modal verb that allows both interpretations.

=== List of auxiliaries unique to African American Vernacular English ===
African American Vernacular English makes a variety of finer tense/aspect distinctions than other dialects of English by making use of unique variant forms of, in particular: habitual &#x27;be&#x27;, reduced &#x27;done&#x27; (dən), and stressed &#x27;been&#x27; (BIN):
===Diagnostics for identifying auxiliary verbs in English===
The verbs listed in the previous section can be classified as auxiliaries based upon two diagnostics: they allow subject–auxiliary inversion (the type of inversion used to form questions etc.) and (equivalently) they can take &quot;not&quot; as a postdependent (a dependent that follows its head). The following examples illustrate the extent to which subject–auxiliary inversion can occur with an auxiliary verb but not with a full verb. (The asterisk * is the means commonly used in linguistics to indicate that the example is grammatically unacceptable or that a particular construction has never been attested in use).

::a. He was working today.
::b. Was he working today? 

::a. He worked today.
::b. *Worked he today? 

::a. She can see it.
::b. Can she see it? 

::a. She sees it.
::b. *Sees she it? 

The following examples illustrate that the negation &quot;not&quot; can appear as a postdependent of a finite auxiliary verb, but not as a postdependent of a finite full verb:

::a. Sam would try that.
::b. Sam would not try that. 

::a. Sam tried that.
::b. *Sam tried not that. 
::a. Tom could help.
::b. Tom could not help. 

::a. Tom helped.
::b. *Tom helped not. 

A third diagnostic that can be used for identifying auxiliary verbs is verb phrase ellipsis. See the article on verb phrase ellipsis for examples.

These criteria lead to the copula &quot;be&quot; and non-copular use of &quot;be&quot; as an existential verb being considered an auxiliary (it undergoes inversion and takes postdependent &quot;not&quot;, e.g., &quot;Is she the boss?&quot;, &quot;She is not the boss&quot;, &quot;Is there a God?&quot;, &quot;There is a God&quot;). However, if one defines &quot;auxiliary verb&quot; as a verb that somehow &quot;helps&quot; another verb, then the copula &quot;be&quot; is not an auxiliary, because it appears without another verb. The literature on auxiliary verbs is somewhat inconsistent in this area.

There are also some properties that some but not all auxiliary verbs have. Their presence can be used to conclude that the verb is an auxiliary, but their absence does not guarantee the converse. One such property is to have the same form in the present tense, also for the first and the third person singular. This in particular is typical for &quot;modal&quot; auxiliary verbs, such as &quot;will&quot; and &quot;must&quot;. (Examples: &quot;He will come tomorrow&quot;, &quot;she must do it at once&quot;, not &quot;he wills&quot; or &quot;she musts&quot;.)

==Light verbs==
Some syntacticians distinguish between auxiliary verbs and light verbs. The two are similar insofar as both verb types contribute mainly just functional information to the clauses in which they appear. Hence both do not qualify as separate predicates, but rather they form part of a predicate with another expression – usually with a full verb in the case of auxiliary verbs and usually with a noun in the case of light verbs.

In English, light verbs differ from auxiliary verbs in that they cannot undergo inversion and they cannot take &quot;not&quot; as a postdependent. The verbs &quot;have&quot; and &quot;do&quot; can function as auxiliary verbs or as light verbs (or as full verbs). When they are light verbs, they fail the inversion and negation diagnostics for auxiliaries, e.g.

Note that in some dialects (for example, the West and South West dialects of Hiberno-English), the inversion test may sound correct to native speakers.
::a. They had a long meeting.
::b. *Had they a long meeting? 

::c. *They had not a long meeting. 

::a. She did a report on pandering politicians.
::b. *Did she a report on pandering politicians? 
::c. *She did not a report on pandering politicians. 

(In some cases, though, &quot;have&quot; may undergo auxiliary-type inversion and negation even when it is not used as an auxiliary verb – see .)
Sometimes the distinction between auxiliary verbs and light verbs is overlooked or confused. Certain verbs (e.g., &quot;used to&quot;, &quot;have to&quot;, etc.) may be judged as light verbs by some authors, but as auxiliaries by others.

<text>Richard Lloyd (born October 25, 1951) is an American guitarist and songwriter, best known as a founding member of the rock band Television.

== Early life ==
Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Lloyd first became interested in music as a child.

Lloyd attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City. In his early teens, he studied drums with William Kessler, who was the ghostwriter for Cozy Cole, one of the famous big-band drummers. A few years later, he turned to the guitar.

== Teenage years ==
When Lloyd was in his middle teens, he met a fellow guitarist from Brooklyn named Velvert Turner. Turner claimed he knew Jimi Hendrix. Per Turner, Hendrix considered Turner his &quot;little brother&quot;, and took him on as his protégé, inviting him to various clubs and teaching him guitar from Hendrix&#x27;s apartment on W 12th St. As Turner and Lloyd were best friends, Turner asked for permission to teach Lloyd what he was learning, and so Lloyd and Turner began practicing together under the teaching auspice of Hendrix. Lloyd frequently attended Hendrix&#x27;s shows, as well as those of other well-known acts such as Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart, The Allman Brothers Band, and the Grateful Dead.

At Stuyvesant High School, during the 11th grade, Lloyd decided that he was going to become a well-known guitarist, and so he stopped bringing his textbooks or homework to school, instead bringing an electric guitar in a hardshell case. When his teachers would ask him where his schoolbooks were, he would point to the case. Being asked to open the case, the teachers would proclaim &quot;I don&#x27;t see any books in there – only an electric guitar&quot;, and Lloyd&#x27;s retort was &quot;That&#x27;s the book I&#x27;m studying.&quot; He still managed to pass all of his tests but quit in May 1969, before graduation, because he did not believe in diplomas, and he considered that having a high school diploma would not do him any good in his pursuit of the music business. That summer his parents moved to Montclair, New Jersey, and gave him an ultimatum: he could either get a job or repeat the 12th grade in a new high school. He chose the latter, which led to his deep friendship with another guitarist named Al Anderson, who went on to be one of a couple of Americans to play in Bob Marley&#x27;s touring band, The Wailers, along with Donald Kinsey.

== Early music career ==
After quitting a second high school before graduation, he moved to Boston, where he lived for two years. It was during this time that he enjoyed his first public performance, sitting in with John Lee Hooker at the Jazz workshop on Boylston Street. By this time Lloyd had already met and knew Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Guy, and members of Led Zeppelin, and could be frequently found backstage conversing with his heroes. John Lee Hooker asked him what he did and Lloyd replied that he was a guitarist, whereupon John Lee Hooker called him over and whispered into his ear &quot;the secret of the electric guitar&quot; and invited him to sit in with the band. After living in Boston for a period of time, Lloyd moved back to New York, but desired to visit other centers of musical culture. He first decided to hitchhike across Route 66, but after considering how long it might take, he flew directly to Los Angeles instead. He spent the next two years in Los Angeles from 1971, practicing the electric guitar without an amplifier and going to record company parties, which at that time were very ostentatious. He lived as a roommate with Richard Cromelin, the music critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, so again, he had access to the highest level and echelon of rock &#x27;n roll.

In 1973, he heard about the New York Dolls and the beginning of a brand-new New York scene, so he arranged with a friend who owned a Lotus Europa to take him as a passenger across the country. As they made their way through the country, with stops in famous towns like Memphis and New Orleans, he reached New York and heard the unpleasant news that the Mercer Arts Center, known for hosting the first concerts of bands like the Dolls, the Modern Lovers and Suicide, had collapsed. He began frequenting shows at the Diplomat Hotel and other spots, and seeing the possibility of a new scene, began contemplating putting a band together. He met a fellow named Terry Ork at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, who had a huge loft in Chinatown and needed a roommate, so Lloyd moved into Ork&#x27;s Chinatown loft, living in the front room, a small room facing East Broadway. Ork worked for Andy Warhol making silkscreen prints at night and working at a theatrical poster shop called Cinemabilia during the daytime. Ork very much wanted to manage or create a band such as Warhol had done with The Velvet Underground. During discussions with Lloyd, Ork mentioned that he knew of another guitarist without a band who was auditioning a couple of songs at Reno Sweeney&#x27;s audition night. Reno Sweeney&#x27;s was an off-Broadway-style club on W. 13th St that mostly hosted singers like Peter Allen and Bette Midler.

== Television ==
Ork and Lloyd went to Reno Sweeney&#x27;s one night during the summer of 1973, where Richard saw Tom Miller play three songs. Lloyd leaned over to Ork during the second song and told him that this fellow had something, but was missing something, and what he was missing, Lloyd had. He advised Ork that if Terry could convince Tom, the combination of Lloyd and Miller would have the makings of the band Terry Ork was looking for. This was the beginning of the formation of the band Television. Miller would eventually change his last name to Verlaine and Richard Meyers became Richard Hell and promised to learn the bass as they went along. With the addition of Billy Ficca on drums, the quartet was complete. Television rehearsed seven days a week for five or six hours a day during the fall and winter of 1973, and made their first public performance on March 2, 1974, at the Town House Theatre on W. 44th St.

Television were looking for a club where they could develop an audience and play more often as the house band, when Verlaine spotted a guy putting up the awning on a bar on the Bowery which stood under a flophouse for homeless alcoholics. Verlaine and Lloyd went back up and discussed the possibility of playing in this new club, which was to be called CBGB. After Television&#x27;s manager Ork promised CBGB a large take at the bar, Television was given a gig at the end of March 1974. CBGB was run by Hilly Kristal, who had planned to feature country, bluegrass and blues (CBGB) at the club, but when several original rock bands like Blondie, the Ramones and Talking Heads started to show up after finding out that there was a place to play, Ork became the official booking agent for the club. CBGB started to get noticed after bands like Television and Talking Heads started to fill the place up, and when a young poet named Patti Smith began playing double bills with Television, the club started becoming famous. CBGB closed its doors in New York in 2007.

After recording demos for various record companies, Richard Hell left the band and was replaced by Blondie&#x27;s bass player at the time, Fred Smith. Fred Smith&#x27;s solid bass playing allowed for a more transcendent and profound music from the two guitarists and drummer, resulting in their being signed to Elektra Records in 1977.

Television recorded two albums for Elektra: &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot;. As a debut release in 1977, &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; remains on lists of greatest albums in rock and roll history, and never has been out of print.

After recording &quot;Adventure&quot; in 1978, and finding success elusive in the United States, Television disbanded after a successful series of dates at New York&#x27;s The Bottom Line. The various members went their separate ways, although all of them continued in the music industry, occasionally to reunite.

== Solo career ==

In 1978, a single of Lloyd&#x27;s song, &quot;I Thought You Wanted to Know,&quot; was released with guitar and harmony vocal by an uncredited Lloyd and lead vocal, bass, and piano by Chris Stamey. The release was credited to Chris Stamey and the dB&#x27;s, although Stamey was the only dB to appear on the recording. 

After Television first disbanded in 1978, Lloyd released a solo album for Elektra Records, titled &quot;Alchemy&quot;. His solo career has included work as a guitarist and session musician for various artists including Matthew Sweet, John Doe (of the band X), and Swiss singer-songwriter Stephan Eicher. In 1990, Lloyd recorded a version of the Roky Erikson/13th Floor Elevators song &quot;Fire Engine&quot;, which was included on the tribute album compilation &quot;Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye&quot;.

He is known to teach other aspiring guitarists in his studio in New York City, where he frequently produces other acts. He acted as producer, recording engineer and band member on the Rocket from the Tombs album &quot;Rocket Redux&quot;, released on Smog Veil Records. He has also produced a number of records for other New York bands, including The Blondes, Inc., Christopher Purdy, Miss Mother USA and Kevin Otto; as well as &quot;Skinny Girls Are Trouble&quot; (2010), the third album by country-punk songwriter Jim Neversink. His other current projects include a reformation of Rocket from the Tombs. He still owns the famous pinstriped Stratocaster he played with Television.

In 1991 he contributed guitar parts to &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, the album by American alternative rock musician Matthew Sweet.

In 1994, he was cast by Cynthia Plaster Caster.

As of 2016, Lloyd has released seven solo albums, beginning with &quot;Alchemy&quot; in 1979, &quot;Field of Fire&quot; in 1986 (reissued in 2007 with an additional disc of music), the live disc &quot;Real Time&quot; in 1987 (recorded at CBGB) and &quot;The Cover Doesn&#x27;t Matter&quot; in 2001. &quot;The Radiant Monkey&quot; was released on Parasol Records in late 2007. The CD features Lloyd on everything but drums (played by session drummer Chris Purdy, with Television&#x27;s Billy Ficca on one track). &quot;The Jamie Neverts Story&quot;, released on Parasol in 2009, was Lloyd&#x27;s tribute to his hero, Jimi Hendrix; and was dedicated to the memory of his friend Velvert Turner; &quot;Jamie Neverts&quot; was the secret name that Velvert and Lloyd came up with to prevent all the kids in the neighborhood from trying to come along when they went to see Hendrix.

In 2010, he released &quot;Lodestones&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;Nuggets From the Vault&quot;. It was issued on vinyl in 2018 for Record Store Day. Of the album, Lloyd said: &quot;I found a large box of unmarked cassettes going back quite a few years. When I began listening to them, I found a number of finished products – songs that for some reason I [had] failed to put on records. [I] got a machine to transfer the cassettes to CDs and I transferred [the] CDs to my machine at my studio and mastered them. When finished I had a 10 song record.&quot;. According to Lloyd&#x27;s website, other players on the record are John Klages and David Leonard on rhythm guitar, and most likely Steve Cohen on bass and Ed Shockley on drums. In 2016, he released &quot;Rosedale&quot;. While Lloyd plays all the instruments on most of the album, Billy Ficca and Chris Frantz also play on a few tracks, and local musicians bassist Terry Clouse and drummer Jeff Brakebill from his new hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee, are also featured. In 2018, Lloyd published his memoir, &quot;Everything Is Combustible: Television, CBGB&#x27;s and Five Decades of Rock and Roll.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In 2015, Lloyd married Sheila O&#x27;Keefe. His memoir notes he has a son, Dylan.

<doc id="51691" wikidata="Q7600005" url="?curid=51691" title="Stanley Unwin (comedian)">
<text>Stanley Unwin (7 June 1911 – 12 January 2002), sometimes billed as Professor Stanley Unwin, was a British comic actor and writer.

He invented his own comic language, &quot;Unwinese&quot;, referred to in the film &quot;Carry On Regardless&quot; (1961) as &quot;gobbledygook&quot;. Unwinese was a corrupted form of English in which many of the words were altered in playful and humorous ways, as in its description of Elvis Presley and his contemporaries as being &quot;wasp-waist and swivel-hippy&quot;. Unwin claimed that the inspiration came from his mother, who once told him that on the way home she had &quot;falolloped (fallen) over&quot; and &quot;grazed her kneeclabbers&quot;.

==Early life==
Unwin&#x27;s parents, Ivan Oswald Unwin (1880–1914) and his wife Jessie Elizabeth ( Brand; 1883–1968) emigrated from England to the Union of South Africa in the early 1900s. Their son was born in Pretoria in 1911. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1914, due to the family&#x27;s poverty Unwin&#x27;s mother arranged for the family to return to England. She worked as a cook at Bow Road police station. By 1919, Unwin had been sent to the National Children&#x27;s Home in Congleton, Cheshire. In the late 1920s, he studied radio, television and languages at Regent Street Polytechnic in London.

In 1937, he married Frances, with whom he had two daughters and a son. Unwin later stated that Unwinese had its roots in enlivening the bedtime stories that he used to tell his children. In 1940, he was given a job in transmitter maintenance for the BBC, and was assigned to the Borough Hill transmitting station in Daventry. Unwin, Frances and their nine-month-old daughter, Marion, moved to Long Buckby in Northamptonshire, where Unwin would reside for the rest of his life.

==Comedy career==
Unwin&#x27;s early career and training introduced him to wireless and radio communication, and this, coupled with work in the BBC&#x27;s War Reporting Unit from about 1944, ultimately proved to be his passage into the media.

While based in Birmingham from 1947 to 1951, Unwin made his first, accidental, transmission. While testing equipment, he gave the microphone to broadcaster F.R. &quot;Buck&quot; Buckley, who ad-libbed a spoof commentary about an imaginary sport called &quot;Fasche&quot;. Buckley then introduced Unwin as &quot;Codlington Corthusite&quot;, whereupon Unwin continued the sketch in Unwinese. The recording was broadcast on Pat Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Mirror of the Month&quot; programme and a favourable audience reaction led to the commissioning of another sketch in which Unwin, playing an inhabitant of Atlantis, was interviewed about life in the sunken city. A letter of praise from Joyce Grenfell, whom Unwin admired, gave him confidence and he determined on a career in show business.

After the war, while in Egypt and recording a series of shows by Frankie Howerd, Unwin stood in for the comedian when Howerd fell ill. Unwin&#x27;s next major breakthrough came when producer Roy Speer introduced him to the comedian Ted Ray. Once Ray had heard Unwin talking, he said simply: &quot;I want him in the series&quot;namely, &quot;The Spice of Life&quot;, co-starring June Whitfield and Kenneth Connor. During the mid-1950s, Unwin performed in about a dozen shows for Speer and made the acquaintance of Johnnie Riscoe and his daughter, Patsy, who would become his managers for the rest of his career. By the end of the 1950s, Unwin had ventured into the film industry, being given a part in the Cardew Robinson film &quot;Fun at St. Fanny&#x27;s&quot; (1956).

In 1968, Unwin was invited to narrate &quot;Happiness Stan&quot;, a six song fairy tale about a boy of the same name, taking up the entire side two of the Small Faces&#x27; album &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot;, which reached number 1 in the UK Albums Chart.

In 1969, Unwin appeared in Gerry Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Supermarionation&quot; TV series &quot;The Secret Service&quot;, both in person and as the voice of the puppet character Father Stanley Unwin, whose appearance was based on him. Episodes typically comprised one or more scenes in which the character of Unwin would attempt to baffle opponents with his gobbledegook. When Lew Grade, Anderson&#x27;s financial backer and head of distributor ITC, was introduced to the Unwinese dialogue, he cancelled the production on the basis that he believed viewers would not understand what Unwin was saying, despite the fact that such confusion was intentional.

Though professionally retired in his later decades, Unwin still continued to make occasional appearances. In the 1970s, he appeared on &quot;The Max Bygraves Show&quot; on ITV, sometimes speaking normally and sometimes in gobbledegook. In the final episode, Bygraves tested a number of gobbledegook phrases on Unwin, who claimed that he could not understand them. In 1985, Unwin recorded with Suns of Arqa on their album &quot;Ark of the Arqans&quot;, providing spoken word accompaniment in Unwinese on the first three tracks. In 1987, he recorded again with Suns of Arqa on their track &quot;Erasmus Meets The Earthling&quot;, featured on their album &quot;Seven&quot;, and a remixed version of this track was released again in the 1990s. He appeared as himself in a hospital scene of Inside Victor Lewis-Smith. In 1994, Unwin collaborated with British dance music act Wubble-U on their single &quot;Petal&quot;; on its re-release in 1998, the track ranked number 55 in the UK Chart. In 1998, Unwin made a cameo appearance in the Aardman Animations series &quot;Rex the Runt&quot;, as an accountant who speaks largely in fairly standard English, occasionally lapsing inexplicably into Unwinese.

===Unwinese===
Unwinese, also known as &quot;Basic Engly Twenty Fido&quot;, was an ornamented and mangled form of English in which many of the words were deliberately corrupted in a playful and humorous manner, but which was still largely comprehensible to the listener. Unwin&#x27;s performances could be hilarious yet disorientating, where the meaning and context were conveyed in a disguised and picturesque style. For example, in his talk on music, &quot;Populode of the Musicolly&quot;, Unwin says:

Unwinese has been compared to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s nonsense poetry, such as &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, where the sentences sound superficially like English when read aloud, but their precise meaning is unclear.

==Death and legacy==
Unwin died at Danetre Hospital in Daventry on 12 January 2002. He is buried in the churchyard at Long Buckby, with Frances, who predeceased him in 1993. Their gravestone bears the epitaph, &quot;Reunitey in the heavenly-bodeDeep Joy!&quot;.

A thanksgiving service was held at St Lawrence&#x27;s Church in Long Buckby and ended with a rendering of &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; by John Percival and friends. The valediction had been prepared by Unwin&#x27;s family in his own style: &quot;Goodly Byelode loyal peeploders! Now all gatherymost to amuse it and have a tilty elbow or a nice cuffle-oteedeeOh Yes!&quot;

Suns of Arqa released a tribute album to Unwin (entitled &quot;Tributey&quot;) following his death, featuring a selection of his works with the band over the years, as well as various interviews.

Unwin&#x27;s work is considered to have been a significant influence on the two books written by John Lennon: &quot;In His Own Write&quot; (1964) and &quot;A Spaniard in the Works&quot; (1965).

<doc id="51692" wikidata="Q7172360" url="?curid=51692" title="Pete and Dud">
<text>Pete and Dud were characters played by the comedians and entertainers Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. 

The dialogue format originated in 1964 when Dudley Moore invited Peter Cook to appear in a television performance. Cook scripted a conversation between two men from Dagenham wearing flat caps. This proved to be very popular with television audiences and the partnership was continued during the series &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;.

Pete is a know-it-all and would-be intellectual, very much in the spirit of E. L. Wisty, and Dud is a put-upon Herbert in a subservient role, who tries to impress Pete with his knowledge. Neither of them has any real sense.

The &quot;Dagenham Dialogues&quot; between the two ranged from paintings (Pete finds the Mona Lisa snooty, and the bottoms of Rubens&#x27;s nudes seem to follow them around the room), reasons why geckos do not live long and being annoyed by film stars (including &quot;bloody Greta Garbo&quot; and &quot;bloody Anna Magnani&quot;) pestering them for romance.

During the 1970s, Cook and Moore used a similar formula for the more adult Derek and Clive recordings.

The comic and personal relationship between Cook and Moore is the subject of the play &quot;Pete and Dud: Come Again&quot;, by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde. In 2010, a group of comedians, Hugh Dennis, Angus Deayton and Alistair McGowan among them, recreated some of the Pete and Dud comic routines on BBC Two in &quot;Pete and Dud: the Lost Sketches&quot;.

Recalling his relationship with David Bowie, English musician Brian Eno has stated &quot;We knew each other for over 40 years, in a friendship that was always tinged by echoes of Pete and Dud.”. Eno has recalled that during the recording sessions for Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot; album, he and Bowie would communicate in Peter Cook and Dudley Moore voices: &quot;We slipped into Peter Cook and Dudley Moore characters. Bowie was Pete and I was Dud, and for the whole time we stayed in character. “Ooh, I dunno about that synthesizer part, Dud.”” Bowie himself recalled, &quot;Brian and I did have Pete and Dud down pretty pat. Long dialogues about John Cage performing on a ‘prepared layer’ at the Bricklayers Arms on the Old Kent Road and the like. Quite silly.”

<text>Kent M. Keith (born in 1949 in Brooklyn) is an American writer and leader in higher education. 

Raised in Nebraska, California, Virginia, Rhode Island and Hawaii, where he graduated from secondary school, Keith entered Harvard College to study government. After graduating, he read philosophy and politics at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, received his J.D. degree at Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, and earned an Ed. D. from the Rossier School of Education at the University of Southern California.

His early career was as an attorney with Cades Schutte Fleming &amp; Wright and then as Director of the State of Hawaii Department of Planning and Economic Development. He was the President of Chaminade University from 1989 to 1995 and was then the Senior Vice President for the YMCA of Honolulu. From 2007 to 2012 he was CEO of the Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership (US), and from 2012 to 2015 he was CEO of the Greenleaf Centre for Servant Leadership (Asia) based in Singapore. In 2015, he became president of Pacific Rim Christian University in Honolulu.

==The Paradoxical Commandments==
&quot;The Paradoxical Commandments&quot; is both a poem and a book by Keith, which he wrote as an undergraduate. It is often found in slightly altered form.

In 1997, Keith learned that the poem &quot;The Paradoxical Commandments&quot; had hung on the wall of Mother Teresa&#x27;s children&#x27;s home in Calcutta, India; and, two decades after writing the original poem, Dr. Keith wrote a book of the same title expanding on the themes of the poem: &quot;Anyway: The Paradoxical Commandments: Finding Personal Meaning in a Crazy World.&quot;

<doc id="51695" wikidata="Q51056" url="?curid=51695" title="Franz Joseph I of Austria">
<text>Franz Joseph I or Francis Joseph I ( ; ; 18 August 1830 – 21 November 1916) was Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary, and the ruler of the other states of the Habsburg monarchy from 1848 until his death in 1916. In the early part of his reign, his realms and territories were referred to as the Austrian Empire, but were reconstituted as the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867. From 1 May 1850 to 24 August 1866, he was also president of the German Confederation.

In December 1848, Franz Joseph&#x27;s uncle Emperor Ferdinand I abdicated the throne at Olomouc, as part of Minister President Felix zu Schwarzenberg&#x27;s plan to end the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Franz Joseph then acceded to the throne. In 1854, he married his first cousin Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria, with whom he had four children: Sophie, Gisela, Rudolf, and Marie Valerie. Largely considered to be a reactionary, Franz Joseph spent his early reign resisting constitutionalism in his domains. The Austrian Empire was forced to cede its influence over Tuscany and most of its claim to Lombardy–Venetia to the Kingdom of Sardinia, following the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 and the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. Although Franz Joseph ceded no territory to the Kingdom of Prussia after the Austrian defeat in the Austro-Prussian War, the Peace of Prague (23 August 1866) settled the German Question in favour of Prussia, which prevented the unification of Germany from occurring under the House of Habsburg.

Franz Joseph was troubled by nationalism throughout his reign. He concluded the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which granted greater autonomy to Hungary and created the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. He ruled peacefully for the next 45 years, but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in 1867, the suicide of his son Rudolf in 1889, and the assassinations of his wife Elisabeth in 1898 and his nephew and heir presumptive, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in 1914.

After the Austro-Prussian War, Austria-Hungary turned its attention to the Balkans, which was a hotspot of international tension because of conflicting interests of Austria with not only the Ottoman but also the Russian Empire. The Bosnian Crisis was a result of Franz Joseph&#x27;s annexation in 1908 of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had already been occupied by his troops since the Congress of Berlin (1878). On 28 June 1914, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo resulted in Austria-Hungary&#x27;s declaration of war against the Kingdom of Serbia, which was an ally of the Russian Empire. This activated a system of alliances declaring war on each other, which resulted in World War I. Franz Joseph died in 1916, after ruling his domains for almost 68 years. He was succeeded by his grandnephew Charles I &amp; IV.

==Early life==

Franz Joseph was born on 18 August 1830 in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna (on the 65th anniversary of the death of Francis of Lorraine) as the eldest son of Archduke Franz Karl (the younger son of Francis I), and Sophie, Princess of Bavaria. Because his uncle, reigning from 1835 as the Emperor Ferdinand, was disabled by seizures, and his father unambitious and retiring, the mother of the young Archduke &quot;Franzi&quot; brought him up as a future emperor, with emphasis on devotion, responsibility and diligence.

For this reason, Franz Joseph was consistently built up as a potential successor to the imperial throne by his politically ambitious mother from early childhood.

Up to the age of 7, little &quot;Franzi&quot; was brought up in the care of the nanny (&quot;Aja&quot;) Louise von Sturmfeder. Then the &quot;state education&quot; began, the central contents of which were &quot;sense of duty&quot;, religiosity and dynastic awareness. The theologian Joseph Othmar von Rauscher conveyed to him the inviolable understanding of rulership of divine origin (divine grace), and therefore a belief that no participation of the population in rulership in the form of parliaments was required.

The educators Heinrich Franz von Bombelles and Colonel Johann Baptist Coronini-Cronberg ordered Archduke Franz to study an enormous amount of time, which initially comprised 18 hours per week and was expanded to 50 hours per week by the age of 16. One of the main focuses of the lessons was language acquisition: in addition to French, the diplomatic language of the time, Latin and Ancient Greek, Hungarian, Czech, Italian and Polish were the most important national languages of the monarchy. In addition, the archduke received general education that was customary at the time (including mathematics, physics, history, geography), which was later supplemented by law and political science. Various forms of physical education completed the extensive program.

On his 13th birthday, Franz Joseph was appointed Colonel-Inhaber of Dragoon Regiment No. 3 and the focus of his training shifted to imparting basic strategic and tactical knowledge. From that point onward, army style dictated his personal fashionfor the rest of his life, he normally wore the uniform of a military officer. Franz Joseph was soon joined by three younger brothers: Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian (born 1832, the future Emperor Maximilian of Mexico); Archduke Karl Ludwig (born 1833, father of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria), and Archduke Ludwig Viktor (born 1842), and a sister, Archduchess Maria Anna (born 1835), who died at the age of 4.

==Revolutions of 1848==
During the Revolutions of 1848, the Austrian Chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich resigned (March–April 1848). The young archduke, who (it was widely expected) would soon succeed his uncle on the throne, was appointed Governor of Bohemia on 6 April 1848, but never took up the post. Sent instead to the front in Italy, he joined Field Marshal Radetzky on campaign on 29 April, receiving his baptism of fire on 5 May at Santa Lucia.

By all accounts, he handled his first military experience calmly and with dignity. Around the same time, the imperial family was fleeing revolutionary Vienna for the calmer setting of Innsbruck, in Tyrol. Called back from Italy, the archduke joined the rest of his family at Innsbruck by mid-June. It was here that Franz Joseph first met his cousin and eventual future bride, Elisabeth, then a girl of 10, but apparently the meeting made little impression.

Following Austria&#x27;s victory over the Italians at Custoza in late July 1848, the court felt it safe to return to Vienna, and Franz Joseph travelled with them. But within a few weeks, Vienna again appeared unsafe, and in September, the court left once more, this time for Olmütz in Moravia. By now, Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz, an influential military commander in Bohemia, was determined to see the young archduke soon put on the throne. It was thought that a new ruler would not be bound by the oaths to respect constitutional government to which Ferdinand had been forced to agree, and that it was necessary to find a young, energetic emperor to replace the kindly but mentally unfit Ferdinand.

By the abdication of his uncle Ferdinand and the renunciation of his father (the mild-mannered Franz Karl), Franz Joseph succeeded as Emperor of Austria at Olmütz on 2 December 1848. At this time, he first became known by his second as well as his first Christian name. The name &quot;Franz Joseph&quot; was chosen to bring back memories of the new Emperor&#x27;s great-granduncle, Emperor Joseph II (Holy Roman Emperor from 1765 to 1790), remembered as a modernising reformer.

Under the guidance of the new prime minister, Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, the new emperor at first pursued a cautious course, granting a constitution in March 1849. At the same time, a military campaign was necessary against the Hungarians, who had rebelled against Habsburg central authority in the name of their ancient constitution. Franz Joseph was also almost immediately faced with a renewal of the fighting in Italy, with King Charles Albert of Sardinia taking advantage of setbacks in Hungary to resume the war in March 1849.

However, the military tide began to turn swiftly in favor of Franz Joseph and the Austrian whitecoats. Almost immediately, Charles Albert was decisively beaten by Radetzky at Novara and forced to sue for peace, as well as to renounce his throne.

===Revolution in Hungary===
Unlike other Habsburg ruled areas, the Kingdom of Hungary had an old historic constitution, which limited the power of the crown and had greatly increased the authority of the parliament since the 13th century.
The Hungarian reform laws (April laws) were based on the 12 points that established the fundaments of modern civil and political rights, economic and societal reforms in the Kingdom of Hungary. The crucial turning point of the Hungarian events were the April laws which was ratified by his uncle King Ferdinand, however the new young Austrian monarch Francis Joseph arbitrarily &quot;revoked&quot; the laws without any legal competence. The monarchs had no right to revoke Hungarian parliamentary laws which were already signed. This unconstitutional act irreversibly escalated the conflict between the Hungarian parliament and Francis Joseph. The Austrian Stadion Constitution was accepted by the Imperial Diet of Austria, where Hungary had no representation, and which traditionally had no legislative power in the territory of Kingdom of Hungary; despite this, it also tried to abolish the Diet of Hungary (which existed as the supreme legislative power in Hungary since the late 12th century.)

The new Austrian constitution also went against the historical constitution of Hungary, and even tried to nullify it. Even the territorial integrity of the country was in danger: On 7 March 1849, an imperial proclamation was issued in the name of the Emperor Francis Joseph, according to the new proclamation, the territory of Kingdom of Hungary would be carved up and administered by five military districts, while the Principality of Transylvania would be reestablished. These events represented a clear and obvious existential threat for the Hungarian state. The new constrained Stadion Constitution of Austria, the revocation of the April laws and the Austrian military campaign against Kingdom of Hungary resulted in the fall of the pacifist Batthyány government (which sought agreement with the court) and led to the sudden emergence of Lajos Kossuth&#x27;s followers in the Hungarian parliament, who demanded the full independence of Hungary. The Austrian military intervention in the Kingdom of Hungary resulted in strong anti-Habsburg sentiment among Hungarians, thus the events in Hungary grew into a war for total independence from the Habsburg dynasty.

====Constitutional and legitimacy problems in Hungary====

On 7 December 1848, the Diet of Hungary formally refused to acknowledge the title of the new king, &quot;as without the knowledge and consent of the diet no one could sit on the Hungarian throne&quot;, and called the nation to arms. While in most Western European countries (like France and the United Kingdom) the monarch&#x27;s reign began immediately upon the death of their predecessor, in Hungary the coronation was indispensable; if it were not properly executed, the kingdom remained &quot;orphaned&quot;.

Even during the long personal union between the Kingdom of Hungary and other Habsburg ruled areas, the Habsburg monarchs had to be crowned as King of Hungary in order to promulgate laws there or exercise royal prerogatives in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary. From a legal point of view, according to the coronation oath, a crowned Hungarian king could not relinquish the Hungarian throne during his life; if the king was alive and unable to do his duty as ruler, a governor (or regent, as they would be called in English) had to assume the royal duties. Constitutionally, Franz Joseph&#x27;s uncle Ferdinand was still the legal king of Hungary. If there was no possibility to inherit the throne automatically due to the death of the predecessor king (since King Ferdinand was still alive), but the monarch wanted to relinquish his throne and appoint another king before his death, technically only one legal solution remained: the parliament had the power to dethrone the king and elect a new king. Due to the legal and military tensions, the Hungarian parliament did not grant Franz Joseph that favour. This event gave to the revolt an excuse of legality. Actually, from this time until the collapse of the revolution, Lajos Kossuth (as elected regent-president) became the de facto and de jure ruler of Hungary.

====Military difficulties in Hungary====
While the revolutions in the Austrian territories had been suppressed by 1849 in Hungary, the situation was more severe and Austrian defeat seemed imminent. Sensing a need to secure his right to rule, Franz Joseph sought help from Russia, requesting the intervention of Tsar Nicholas I, in order &quot;to prevent the Hungarian insurrection developing into a European calamity&quot;. For the Russian military support, Franz Joseph kissed the hand of the tsar in Warsaw on 21 May 1849. Tsar Nicholas supported Franz Joseph in the name of the Holy Alliance, and sent a 200,000 strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces. After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under brutal martial law.

With order now restored throughout his empire, Franz Joseph felt free to renege on the constitutional concessions he had made, especially as the Austrian parliament meeting at Kremsier had behaved—in the young Emperor&#x27;s eyes—abominably. The 1849 constitution was suspended, and a policy of absolutist centralism was established, guided by the Minister of the Interior, Alexander Bach.

====Assassination attempt in 1853====
On 18 February 1853, Franz Joseph survived an assassination attempt by Hungarian nationalist János Libényi. The emperor was taking a stroll with one of his officers, Count Maximilian Karl Lamoral O&#x27;Donnell, on a city bastion, when Libényi approached him. He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck. Franz Joseph almost always wore a uniform, which had a high collar that almost completely enclosed the neck. The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material, precisely to counter this kind of attack. Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life. Count O&#x27;Donnell struck Libényi down with his sabre.

O&#x27;Donnell, hitherto a Count only by virtue of his Irish nobility, was made a Count of the Habsburg monarchy (&quot;Reichsgraf&quot;). Another witness who happened to be nearby, the butcher Joseph Ettenreich, swiftly overpowered Libényi. For his deed he was later elevated to the nobility by the emperor and became Joseph von Ettenreich. Libényi was subsequently put on trial and condemned to death for attempted regicide. He was executed on the Simmeringer Heide.

After this unsuccessful attack, the emperor&#x27;s brother Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian called upon Europe&#x27;s royal families for donations to construct a new church on the site of the attack. The church was to be a votive offering for the survival of the emperor. It is located on Ringstraße in the district of Alsergrund close to the University of Vienna, and is known as the Votivkirche. The survival of Franz Joseph was also commemorated in Prague by erecting a new statue of St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of the emperor, on Charles Bridge. It was donated by Count Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky, the first minister-president of the Austrian Empire.

==Consolidation of domestic policy==

The next few years saw the seeming recovery of Austria&#x27;s position on the international scene following the near disasters of 1848–1849. Under Schwarzenberg&#x27;s guidance, Austria was able to stymie Prussian scheming to create a new German Federation under Prussian leadership, excluding Austria. After Schwarzenberg&#x27;s premature death in 1852, he could not be replaced by statesmen of equal stature, and the emperor himself effectively took over as prime minister. He was one of the most prominent Roman Catholic rulers in Europe, and a fierce enemy of Freemasonry.

===Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867===
The 1850s witnessed several failures of Austrian external policy: the Crimean War, the dissolution of its alliance with Russia, and defeat in the Second Italian War of Independence. The setbacks continued in the 1860s with defeat in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, which resulted in the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.

The Hungarian political leaders had two main goals during the negotiations. One was to regain the traditional status (both legal and political) of the Hungarian state, which was lost after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The other was to restore the series of reform laws of the revolutionary parliament of 1848, which were based on the 12 points that established modern civil and political rights, economic and societal reforms in Hungary.

The Compromise partially re-established the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hungary, separate from, and no longer subject to the Austrian Empire. Instead, it was regarded as an equal partner with Austria. The compromise put an end to 18 years of absolutist rule and military dictatorship which had been introduced by Francis Joseph after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Franz Joseph was crowned King of Hungary on 8 June, and on 28 July he promulgated the laws that officially turned the Habsburg domains into the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. 

According to Emperor Franz Joseph, &quot;There were three of us who made the agreement: Deák, Andrássy and myself.&quot; However, the role of Empress Elisabeth (Sisi) cannot be understated in facilitating this compromise. Fluent in Hungarian and deeply sympathetic to the Hungarian cause, Elisabeth fostered close relationships with Hungarian leaders, including Count Gyula Andrássy, and worked behind the scenes to persuade Francis Joseph to adopt a more conciliatory approach. Her influence helped build the trust necessary for successful negotiations, and her personal popularity in Hungary significantly bolstered the monarchy&#x27;s legitimacy in the region.

Political difficulties in Austria mounted continuously through the late 19th century and into the 20th century. However, Franz Joseph remained immensely respected; the emperor&#x27;s patriarchal authority held the Empire together while the politicians squabbled among themselves.

===Bohemian question===

Following the accession of Franz Joseph to the throne in 1848, the political representatives of the Kingdom of Bohemia hoped and insisted that account should be taken of their historical state rights in the upcoming constitution. They felt the position of Bohemia within the Habsburg monarchy should have been highlighted by a coronation of the new ruler to the king of Bohemia in Prague (the last coronation took place in 1836). However, before the 19th century the Habsburgs had ruled Bohemia by hereditary right and a separate coronation was not deemed necessary.

His new government installed the system of neoabsolutism in Austrian internal affairs to make the Austrian Empire a unitary, centralised and bureaucratically administered state. When Franz Joseph returned to constitutional rule after the debacles in Italy at Magenta and Solferino and summoned the diets of his lands, the question of his coronation as king of Bohemia again returned to the agenda, as it had not since 1848. On 14 April 1861, Emperor Franz Joseph received a delegation from the Bohemian Diet with his words (in Czech):

In contrast to his predecessor Emperor Ferdinand (who spent the rest of his life after his abdication in 1848 in Bohemia and especially in Prague), Franz Joseph was never crowned separately as king of Bohemia. In 1861, the negotiations failed because of unsolved constitutional problems. However, in 1866, a visit of the monarch to Prague following defeat at the Battle of Königgrätz was a huge success, testified by the considerable numbers of new photographs taken.

In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian compromise and the introduction of the dual monarchy left the Czechs and their aristocracy without the recognition of separate Bohemian state rights for which they had hoped. Bohemia remained part of the Austrian Crown Lands. In Bohemia, opposition to dualism took the form of isolated street demonstrations, resolutions from district representations, and even open air mass protest meetings, confined to the biggest cities, such as Prague. The Czech newspaper &quot;Národní listy&quot; complained that the Czechs had not yet been compensated for their wartime losses and sufferings during the Austro-Prussian War, and had just seen their historic state rights tossed aside and their land subsumed into the &quot;other&quot; half of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, commonly called &quot;Cisleithania&quot;.

The Czech hopes were revived again in 1870–1871. In an Imperial Rescript of 26 September 1870, Franz Joseph referred again to the prestige and glory of the Bohemian Crown and to his intention to hold a coronation. Under Minister-President Karl Hohenwart in 1871, the government of Cisleithania negotiated a series of fundamental articles spelling out the relationship of the Bohemian Crown to the rest of the Habsburg Monarchy. On 12 September 1871, Franz Joseph announced:

For the planned coronation, the composer Bedřich Smetana had written the opera &quot;Libuše&quot;, but the ceremony did not take place. The creation of the German Empire, domestic opposition from German-speaking liberals (especially German-Bohemians) and from Hungarians doomed the Fundamental Articles. Hohenwart resigned and nothing changed.

Many Czech people were waiting for political changes in monarchy, including Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and others. Masaryk served in the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; (Upper House) from 1891 to 1893 in the Young Czech Party and again from 1907 to 1914 in the Realist Party (which he had founded in 1900), but he did not campaign for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. In Vienna in 1909 he helped Hinko Hinković&#x27;s defense in the fabricated trial against prominent Croats and Serbs members of the Serbo-Croatian Coalition (such as Frano Supilo and Svetozar Pribićević), and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years and a number of death penalties. The Bohemian question would remain unresolved for the entirety of Franz Joseph&#x27;s reign.

==Foreign policy==
===German question===

The main foreign policy goal of Franz Joseph had been the unification of Germany under the House of Habsburg. This was justified on grounds of precedence; from 1452 to the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, with only one brief period of interruption under the House of Wittelsbach, the Habsburgs had generally held the German crown. However, Franz Joseph&#x27;s desire to retain the non-German territories of the Habsburg Austrian Empire in the event of German unification proved problematic.

Two factions quickly developed: a party of German intellectuals favouring a Greater Germany (&quot;Großdeutschland&quot;) under the House of Habsburg; the other favouring a Lesser Germany (&quot;Kleindeutschland&quot;). The Greater Germans favoured the inclusion of Austria in a new all-German state on the grounds that Austria had always been a part of Germanic empires, that it was the leading power of the German Confederation, and that it would be absurd to exclude eight million Austrian Germans from an all-German nation state. The champions of a lesser Germany argued against the inclusion of Austria on the grounds that it was a multi-nation state, not a German one, and that its inclusion would bring millions of non-Germans into the German nation state.

If Greater Germany were to prevail, the crown would necessarily have to go to Franz Joseph, who had no desire to cede it in the first place to anyone else. On the other hand, if the idea of a smaller Germany won out, the German crown could of course not possibly go to the Emperor of Austria, but would naturally be offered to the head of the largest and most powerful German state outside of Austria—the King of Prussia. The contest between the two ideas, quickly developed into a contest between Austria and Prussia. After Prussia decisively won the Seven Weeks War, this question was solved; Austria lost no territories to Prussia as long as they remained out of German affairs.

=== Three Emperors League ===
In 1873, two years after the unification of Germany, Franz Joseph entered into the League of Three Emperors (&quot;Dreikaiserbund&quot;) with Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany and Emperor Alexander II of Russia, who was succeeded by Tsar Alexander III in 1881. The league had been designed by the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, as an attempt to maintain the peace of Europe. It would last intermittently until 1887.

=== Vatican ===
In 1903, Franz Joseph&#x27;s veto of Jus exclusivae of Cardinal Mariano Rampolla&#x27;s election to the papacy was transmitted to the Papal conclave by Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko. It was the last use of such a veto, as the new Pope Pius X prohibited future uses and provided for excommunication for any attempt.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===


During the mid-1870s, a series of violent rebellions against Ottoman rule broke out in the Balkans, and the Turks responded with equally violent and oppressive reprisals. Tsar Alexander II of Russia, wanting to intervene against the Ottomans, sought and obtained an agreement with Austria-Hungary.

In the Budapest Convention of 1877, the two powers agreed that Russia would annex southern Bessarabia, and Austria-Hungary would observe a benevolent neutrality toward Russia in the pending war with the Turks. As compensation for this support, Russia agreed to Austria-Hungary&#x27;s annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. A scant 15 months later, the Russians imposed on the Ottomans the Treaty of San Stefano, which reneged on the Budapest accord and declared that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be jointly occupied by Russian and Austrian troops.

The treaty was overturned by the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, which allowed sole Austrian occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina but did not specify a final disposition of the provinces. That omission was addressed in the Three Emperors&#x27; League agreement of 1881, when both Germany and Russia endorsed Austria-Hungary&#x27;s right to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, by 1897, under a new tsar, the Russian Imperial government had again withdrawn its support for Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian foreign minister, Count Mikhail Muravyov, stated that an Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina would raise &quot;an extensive question requiring special scrutiny&quot;.

In 1908, the Russian foreign minister, Alexander Izvolsky, offered Russian support, for the third time, for the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, in exchange for Austrian support for the opening of the Bosporus Strait and the Dardanelles to Russian warships. Austria&#x27;s foreign minister, Alois von Aehrenthal, pursued this offer vigorously, resulting in the quid pro quo understanding with Izvolsky, reached on 16 September 1908 at the Buchlau Conference. However, Izvolsky made this agreement with Aehrenthal without the knowledge of Tsar Nicholas II or his government in St. Petersburg, or any of the other foreign powers including Britain, France and Serbia.

Based upon the assurances of the Buchlau Conference and the treaties that preceded it, Franz Joseph signed the proclamation announcing the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina into the Empire on 6 October 1908. However a diplomatic crisis erupted, as both the Serbs and the Italians demanded compensation for the annexation, which the Austro-Hungarian government refused to entertain. The incident was not resolved until the revision of the Treaty of Berlin in April 1909, exacerbating tensions between Austria-Hungary and the Serbs.

==Outbreak of World War I==

On 28 June 1914, Franz Joseph&#x27;s nephew and heir presumptive Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his morganatic wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were assassinated by Gavrilo Princip, a Yugoslav nationalist of Serbian ethnicity, during a visit to Sarajevo. Franz Joseph learned about the assassination of Franz Ferdinand from his adjutant, cavalry General Eduard von Paar, who also wrote the emperor&#x27;s reaction in his diary: &quot;one has not to defy the Almighty. In this manner a superior power has restored that order which I unfortunately was unable to maintain.&quot;

While the emperor was shaken, and interrupted his holiday to return to Vienna, he soon resumed his vacation at his Kaiservilla at Bad Ischl. Initial decision-making during the &quot;July Crisis&quot; fell to Count Leopold Berchtold, the Austrian foreign minister; Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, the chief of staff for the Austro-Hungarian army and the other ministers. The ultimate resolution of deliberations by the Austro-Hungarian government during the weeks following the assassination of the Archduke was to give Serbia an ultimatum of itemized demands with which it was virtually certain Serbia would be unable or unwilling to comply, thus serving as a &quot;legal basis for war&quot;.

A week after delivery of the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia; on 28 July, war was declared. Within weeks, the Germans, Russians, French and British had all entered the fray which eventually became known as World War I. On 6 August, Franz Joseph signed the declaration of war against Russia.

==Death==
Franz Joseph died in the Schönbrunn Palace on the evening of 21 November 1916, at the age of 86. His death was a result of developing pneumonia of the right lung several days after catching a cold while walking in Schönbrunn Park with King Ludwig III of Bavaria. He was succeeded by his grandnephew Charles I &amp; IV, who reigned until the collapse of the empire following its defeat at the end of the First World War in 1918.

He is buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.

== Family ==
It was generally felt in the court that the emperor should marry and produce heirs as soon as possible. Various potential brides were considered, including Princess Elisabeth of Modena, Princess Anna of Prussia and Princess Sidonia of Saxony. Although in public life Franz Joseph was the unquestioned director of affairs, in his private life his mother still wielded crucial influence. Sophie wanted to strengthen the relationship between the Houses of Habsburg and Wittelsbach—descending from the latter house herself—and hoped to match Franz Joseph with her sister Ludovika&#x27;s eldest daughter, Helene (&quot;Néné&quot;), who was four years the emperor&#x27;s junior.

However, Franz Joseph fell deeply in love with Néné&#x27;s younger sister Elisabeth (&quot;Sisi&quot;), a beautiful girl of 15, and insisted on marrying her instead. Sophie acquiesced, despite her misgivings about Sisi&#x27;s appropriateness as an imperial consort, and the young couple were married on 24 April 1854 in St. Augustine&#x27;s Church, Vienna.

Their marriage would eventually prove to be an unhappy one; though Franz Joseph was passionately in love with his wife, the feeling was not mutual. Elisabeth never truly acclimatized to life at court, and was frequently in conflict with the imperial family. Their first daughter Sophie died as an infant, and their only son Rudolf died by suicide in 1889 in the infamous Mayerling Incident.

In 1885, Franz Joseph met Katharina Schratt, a leading actress of the Vienna stage, and she became his friend and confidante. This relationship lasted the rest of his life, and was—to a certain degree—tolerated by Elisabeth. Franz Joseph built Villa Schratt in Bad Ischl for her, and also provided her with a small palace in Vienna. Though their relationship lasted for 34 years, it remained platonic.

The empress was an inveterate traveller, horsewoman, and fashion maven who was rarely seen in Vienna. Sisi was obsessed about preserving her beauty, carrying out many bizarre routines and strenuous exercise, and as a result suffered from ill health. She was stabbed to death by an Italian anarchist in 1898 while on a visit to Geneva. A few days after the funeral, Robert of Parma wrote in a letter to his friend Tirso de Olazábal that &quot;It was pitiful to look at the Emperor, he showed a great deal of energy in his immense pain, but at times one could see all the immensity of his grief.&quot; Franz Joseph never fully recovered from the loss. According to the future empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma he told his relatives: &quot;You&#x27;ll never know how important she was to me&quot; or, according to some sources, &quot;You will never know how much I loved this woman.&quot;

===Relationship with Franz Ferdinand===

Archduke Franz Ferdinand became heir presumptive (&quot;Thronfolger&quot;) to the throne of Austria-Hungary in 1896 after the deaths of his cousin Rudolf (in 1889) and his father Karl Ludwig (in 1896). The relationship between him and Franz Joseph had always been a fairly contentious one, which was further exacerbated when Franz Ferdinand announced his desire to marry Countess Sophie Chotek. The emperor would not even consider giving his blessing to the union, as Sophie was merely of noble rank, not dynastic rank.

Although the emperor received letters from members of the imperial family throughout the fall and winter of 1899 beseeching him to relent, Franz Joseph stood his ground. He finally gave his consent in 1900. However, the marriage was to be morganatic, and any children of the marriage would be ineligible to succeed to the throne. The couple were married on 1 July 1900 at Reichstadt. The emperor did not attend the wedding, nor did any of the archdukes. After that, the two men disliked and mistrusted each other.

His interactions with Franz Ferdinand were strained; the emperor&#x27;s personal attendant recollected in his memoirs that:&lt;br&gt; &quot;thunder and lightning always raged when they had their discussions.&quot; 

Following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and Sophie in 1914, Franz Joseph&#x27;s daughter, Marie Valerie, noted that her father expressed his greater confidence in the new heir presumptive, his grandnephew Archduke Charles. The emperor admitted to his daughter, regarding the assassination: &lt;br&gt;&quot;For me, it is a relief from a great worry.&quot;

===Legacy===
Franz Josef Land in the Russian Arctic was named in his honour in 1873 by the Austro-Hungarian North Pole expedition which first reported finding it. The Franz Josef Glacier in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island also bears his name.

Franz Joseph founded in 1872 the &quot;Franz Joseph University&quot; (Hungarian: &quot;Ferenc József Tudományegyetem&quot;, Romanian: &quot;Universitatea Francisc Iosif&quot;) in the city of Cluj-Napoca (at that time a part of Austria-Hungary under the name of Kolozsvár). The university was moved to Szeged after Cluj became a part of Romania, becoming the University of Szeged.

In certain areas, celebrations are still being held in remembrance of Franz Joseph&#x27;s birthday.

<doc id="51696" wikidata="Q191139" url="?curid=51696" title="Fabien Barthez">
<text>Fabien Alain Barthez (born 28 June 1971) is a French racing driver and former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. At club level, he played football in both France and England with Toulouse, Marseille, Monaco, Manchester United and Nantes. At international level, he played for the France national team, with whom he won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, representing his nation at a total of three editions of both the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship; he also reached the final of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, after which he retired from international football.

Nicknamed &quot;Le Divin Chauve&quot; (&quot;The Divine Bald One&quot;), due to his trademark shaved head, Barthez was France&#x27;s most capped player in the FIFA World Cup, with 17 appearances at the finals and shares the record for the most World Cup finals clean sheets with Peter Shilton, with ten. In club football, he won the UEFA Champions League with Olympique Marseille in 1993 as well as several Ligue 1 and Premier League titles. After retiring from football in 2007, Barthez began a career in motorsport in 2008.

==Early life==
Barthez was born in Lavelanet, Ariège.

==Club career==
===Marseille===
Barthez made his first division debut for Toulouse on 21 September 1991, against Nancy. He joined Marseille in 1992, and won both the French championship and the Champions League at the end of his first season in Marseille, keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory over Milan in final of the latter competition. The 1993 victory made him the youngest goalkeeper to win a Champions League title until Iker Casillas did so in 2000.

Marseille, however, would be stripped of their domestic title, though not of the Champions League crown, due to their involvement in a domestic match fixing scandal, and a year later (1994) would suffer a forced relegation to the second division due to a related financial bankruptcy. He stayed with the club in Division 2 for the 1994–95 season, despite many offers from elite French clubs, helping Marseille to the title. This, however, did not earn them a promotion back to Ligue 1 due to their punishment (they were promoted the following season, after finishing second in division 2).

===Monaco===
In 1995, Barthez joined Monaco and won Ligue 1 titles in 1997 and 2000. He also played in Jean Tigana&#x27;s talented Monaco side, which famously put his future club Manchester United out of the Champions League in 1998 on away goals after a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford.

===Manchester United===
As a result of Barthez&#x27;s success in the World Cup and the Euros, he caught the attention of Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who was searching for a star goalkeeper to replace the recently departed Peter Schmeichel, as Ferguson did not think that the previous season&#x27;s goalkeeper, Mark Bosnich, was a long-term replacement. Barthez joined United for £7.8 million in 2000. He was later reunited with national teammate Laurent Blanc, who joined United in 2001. The Barthez–Blanc head-kissing ritual was performed at the start of Champions League matches.

Well known for being eccentric, Barthez started out well for Manchester United. His first season was a triumph as he answered all the questions about how he would handle rainy Manchester compared to sunny Monaco. Barthez performed brilliantly throughout the season and became a crowd favourite. The fans loved his eccentric behaviour, his taunting dribbles and step-overs past opposing strikers, and most importantly, his remarkable reaction saves. Very often, it was critical saves that kept United from defeat or dropping valuable points, helping United to the 2000–01 FA Premier League title, their third in a row.

A memorable incident happened when Manchester United faced Leeds United in March 2001. After dropping a cross from Robbie Keane, Barthez deliberately kicked out with his foot at Ian Harte, who fell to the ground on the edge of six yard box, and the referee awarded a penalty to Leeds. Harte stepped up but Barthez made a low, one-handed save to his right. The only blemish in his first season was his failed attempt at &quot;psyching out&quot; West Ham United&#x27;s Paolo Di Canio in the FA Cup Fourth Round; Di Canio beat the offside trap, while Barthez stood still with his hand up expecting the referee to blow his whistle, or Di Canio to stop. Di Canio continued and scored the only goal of the game, and later said it was &quot;better to score and then see whether the goalkeeper is right or wrong&quot;.

The 2001–02 season was split into two parts for him. The first half was tumultuous. The Frenchman seemed to be taking some unnecessary risks outside his penalty area, and his antics began to have consequences that allowed unneeded goals for opposing teams. He was at fault for two goals in a 3–2 home defeat by Deportivo de La Coruña in October 2001. Ferguson said how &quot;eventually he will get caught out&quot; and it wouldn&#x27;t happen again. But another couple of late errors against Arsenal in a 3–1 defeat at Highbury the following month put much pressure on Barthez, with two goals gifted to Thierry Henry, one of which came from a mis-hit clearance. Barthez was at the centre of further controversy when, after already being on a yellow card following an argument with Matthew Upson, he was caught by television cameras raising his middle fingers behind his back towards the Arsenal supporters, who had been taunting him for his errors towards the end of the match; the incident was missed by the referee Peter Jones, however. There was much speculation as to what was the source of Barthez&#x27;s decline, and critics such as the BBC&#x27;s Phil McNulty urged him to be dropped. Sir Alex Ferguson, however, had faith in his goalkeeper, and stuck by him. Consequently, in the second half of the season, Barthez repaired his reputation with consistent, solid performances and the spectacular saves that he was famous for. His turn in fortunes was shown in a 2–2 draw with Derby County at Pride Park. Derby forward Malcolm Christie looked to have sealed his hat-trick, but referee Steve Dunn controversially disallowed the goal, ruling that Christie kicked the ball out of Barthez&#x27;s hands.

He was also noted for playing mind games before opposition players took a penalty. The first time this occurred was in November 2001 when Leicester City came to Old Trafford. As Muzzy Izzet prepared to take a penalty, Barthez stood aside from the goal, with his hands behind him on the post. Izzet, tired of waiting, slotted the ball in the bottom corner, but referee Andy D&#x27;Urso made him retake the penalty, this time with Barthez in goal. Izzet went the same way, but Barthez denied him with a fine save to his right. An almost identical incident happened less than a year later in October 2002, when Barthez was unhappy about the awarding of a penalty to Fulham, and so went from post to post banging his boots, and refused to be in goal for the penalty. This time he was booked for his antics by referee Mike Dean, and so he then took his place between the posts and made it work again by saving Steed Malbranque&#x27;s spot kick.

The 2002–03 season ended with another Premier League crown for United. The season was a mixed bag for Barthez. One highlight was a fabulous save to deny Dietmar Hamann&#x27;s 30-yard rocket at Anfield against Liverpool, as United held on to win 2–1. In other games, he let goals go past him that he would have been expected to save, and suffered from a run of poor form towards the end of the season. Barthez was also widely criticized in United&#x27;s exit to Real Madrid in the Champions League, especially for Ronaldo&#x27;s opener which beat him at the near post. It would prove to be his last ever game with United as Sir Alex Ferguson&#x27;s patience had finally run out. Barthez was dropped for the final three games of the season, with Roy Carroll taking his place.

===Return to Marseille===
Barthez&#x27;s poor form at the end of the previous season and the arrival of American newcomer Tim Howard in summer of 2003, saw the Frenchman face competition for a starting spot at United. As Barthez had only returned from international duty in August, Howard played during the club&#x27;s American tour of the summer, and his performances led Ferguson to choose him to start over Barthez in the Community Shield in August. By October, Howard had won the starting goalkeeper&#x27;s job from Barthez; as a result, United agreed to release Barthez from his contract at Old Trafford after the 2003–04 season, and also agreed to loan Barthez out to his former club Marseille for the remainder of that season. Barthez began training with Marseille, who took on a portion of his wages, but FIFA initially blocked the loan deal on the grounds that it was not agreed upon within the international transfer window. The two clubs agreed on a loan deal after the transfer window reopened on 1 January 2004, and Barthez joined Marseille soon afterwards. On 27 April, Marseille and Barthez agreed to a two-and-a-half-year contract which would keep him at the club until spring 2006.

Barthez was involved in a controversy during a friendly match between Marseille and Morocco&#x27;s Wydad Casablanca on 12 February 2005. With ten minutes left, a Marseille player was sent off and a brawl erupted between players on the pitch. Barthez was reported for spitting on the Moroccan referee. On 21 April, Barthez was summoned to a hearing before the disciplinary committee of the French Football Federation (FFF); the following day, he received a six-month suspension, with the last three months being suspended. In an unusual move, the federal council of the FFF appealed the suspension, arguing that the punishment should have been for a minimum of six full months. Eventually, his suspension was extended to six full months due to political pressures.

===Retirement===
On 8 August 2006, Barthez announced he was still hoping to play professional football for another two years, insisting he was also looking to continue his career in the French international setup. His ideal scenario would have been a return to first club Toulouse, where he could be close enough to allow him to take care of his sick mother. But he said if he did not have a club by 31 August he would not carry on with football. On 5 October 2006, it was confirmed that he had retired from football, having failed to agree a return to Toulouse. Barthez commented: &quot;The only club I wanted to go to was not so happy to have me. It happens and you have to live with it.&quot;

===Comeback===

On 17 December 2006, Barthez announced his return to football by signing a contract with Ligue 1 side Nantes, who were lacking an experienced goalkeeper following Mickaël Landreau&#x27;s move to Paris Saint-Germain the previous summer. Serbian goalkeeper Vladimir Stojković, originally recruited to replace Landreau, failed to impress and left Nantes at the winter break following a rift within the squad.

On 29 April, Nantes chairman Rudi Roussillon announced that following an altercation with a Nantes fan, Barthez had left the city with his family. The next day, Barthez confirmed that he had quit the team, and the club terminated his contract. Barthez denied that he was planning to retire, and in an article for French daily &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, he said that he was looking for another contract for at least two years. Barthez was linked with numerous clubs, but nothing ever materialised and he had to face never playing professional football again.

===Luzenac===
In 2012, Barthez became the honorary president of Championnat National team Luzenac, where he personally picked Quentin Westberg and Nicolas Dieuze to sign for the club.

==International career==

===Early international career===
On 26 May 1994, Barthez won his first cap for France in a 1–0 victory against Australia. Barthez was understudy to Bernard Lama at UEFA Euro 1996 – at which France reached the semi-finals – after testing positive for cannabis earlier that year; he was suspended for two months as a result. Following a later suspension to Lama instead, however, Barthez subsequently gained the number one goalkeeping position shortly after the tournament and would not relinquish it for a decade.

===1998 World Cup===

In the 1998 FIFA World Cup, which was hosted by his home country, Barthez conceded only two goals in seven games and won the Yashin Award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament, also placing second in the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper award that year, behind José Luis Chilavert. Barthez was also well known during the tournament for letting teammate and good friend Laurent Blanc kiss his shaved head before the start of every match, supposedly for good luck. Barthez was an integral part of his national team&#x27;s inaugural triumph which also made it the first time in 20 years that a host had won the World Cup. He kept five clean sheets throughout the tournament, with the only goals he conceded being a penalty in the group stage against Denmark, and another goal against Croatia in the semi-final. In the quarter-final shootout defeat of rivals Italy, he kept a clean sheet, and also saved Demetrio Albertini&#x27;s penalty kick. He kept another clean sheet in the final, which ended in a 3–0 win over defending champions Brazil. During the game, Barthez was also at the centre of a notable controversial incident when he made a spectacular save while rushing out and attempting to anticipate Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, doing his trademark leap/step-over the attacking striker to grab the ball, which injured Ronaldo in the process; Barthez later commented that he never intended to hurt the striker. Following France&#x27;s World Cup victory, Barthez was one of the most popular national players in France, after Zinedine Zidane.

===Euro 2000===
Two years later, Barthez was again the starter as his country won Euro 2000. It was the first time in 26 years that a national team held both the World Cup and Euro titles, a feat last accomplished by West Germany in 1974. After that triumph, France held the top position in the FIFA World Rankings system from 2001 to 2002.

===2002 World Cup and Euro 2004===
Barthez played on France&#x27;s World Cup team again in 2002 in which they exited in the first round without winning a game or scoring a goal; he kept his only clean sheet of the tournament in his nation&#x27;s second group match, a 0–0 draw against Uruguay. He was also his nation&#x27;s starting keeper throughout their victorious Confederations Cup campaign in 2003, and at Euro 2004; in the latter tournament, he saved David Beckham&#x27;s penalty shot in the opening round robin match, but France went out in the quarter-finals to eventual winners Greece.

===2006 World Cup===

His place as starting goalkeeper in France&#x27;s 2006 World Cup campaign, in the face of a substantial public campaign in support of Grégory Coupet, was surprising to many, even more so given Coupet&#x27;s flawless performance in the remainder of the World Cup qualifying campaign after Barthez&#x27;s suspension. The decision was met with derision in the French press and also led to Coupet&#x27;s walking out of the national squad before the tournament, though he was to return one day later. The move was viewed by some as a desire to keep the veterans of France&#x27;s 1998 World Cup victory on the team. &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot; reported after the World Cup that Barthez would have walked out of the squad had he not been named the starter.

France had a slow start in the group stage, drawing their first two games and putting their chances of reaching the knock-out stages at risk. Fortunately, Barthez&#x27;s team found their form and won their final round robin match 2–0 to advance to the next stage, where they upset heavily favoured Spain 3–1 in the round of 16.

In defeating Brazil, 1–0 on 1 July 2006, Barthez, having made only one save in the game (on an injury time shot from Ronaldo), became the first keeper to blank the Brazilian team in consecutive World Cup finals matches, the first being the 1998 final (3–0). France is now one of only four nations (along with Italy, Argentina and the Netherlands) to have shut Brazil out twice in the World Cup finals, and the first to have done it in consecutive matches, both times with Barthez in goal.

Barthez again kept another clean sheet – his fourth of the tournament – in the semi-final against Portugal (with Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s penalty shot the winning goal), though he appeared in questionable form. A few minutes from time, he spectacularly spilled a free-kick which Luís Figo recovered, heading over the bar although unchallenged. He did, however, redeem himself in injury time when a French defender fumbled the ball, enabling a Portuguese player to mount a last-moment attack. Barthez scrambled out of the net and blocked the first shot.

During the final against Italy, he briefly captained his team for the remainder of the second period of extra time after Zidane was sent off. During the penalty shootout, neither he nor his Italian counterpart Gianluigi Buffon made a save, and France striker David Trezeguet&#x27;s missed shot ultimately proved decisive. This proved to be Barthez&#x27;s 87th and final international appearance, as he retired from international football following the tournament.

==Motorsport career==

After retiring from football in 2007, Barthez began a career in motorsport in 2008. He began competing at selected events in the Porsche Carrera Cup France that year with the team SOFREV Auto Sport Promotion. He also competed at two events in the THP Spider Cup. In 2009, he raced in a number of various motorsport series such as the French GT Championship, Bioracing Series and the Caterham Sigma Cup France as well as the Porsche Carrera Cup France. He continued to race in the FFSA GT Championship in 2010 and picked up his first podium in race 1 at Dijon-Prenois. In the 2012 season, he won his first race in the FFSA series at the Circuito de Navarra in race two and finished seventh in the championship. In 2013, he was crowned French GT Champion alongside Morgan Moullin-Traffort, driving a Ferrari.

In 2013, he also competed in the newly re-branded FIA GT Series alongside Gérard Tonelli in the Gentleman Trophy class with SOFREV ASP, driving a GT3-spec Ferrari 458 Italia.

In February 2014, it was announced that Barthez would enter the 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans race, driving Sofrev ASP&#x27;s Ferrari 458. Barthez and his co-drivers finished 29th overall and ninth in the LMGTE Am class.

==Coaching career==
On 2 July 2010, after Laurent Blanc&#x27;s appointment as the new manager of the France national team, Barthez was named among the team&#x27;s technical staff as a goalkeeping coach.

==Style of play==
Rated by pundits as one of the greatest goalkeepers of his generation, in his prime, Barthez was considered to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world, and is regarded as one of the best French players ever in his position, being named the fourth greatest French goalkeeper of all time in IFFHS&#x27; Century elections, behind Bernard Lama, Pierre Chayriguès and Julien Darui. Standing at , he was not particularly tall for a goalkeeper, although he was extremely athletic, and was known for his elevation, as well as his decision-making, bravery, ability to read the game and commitment when coming out to collect the ball, which made him effective in the air and enabled him to command his area effectively in spite of his short stature; however, at times, he was still caught out on high balls due to his lack of height and poor handling, and he also came under criticism on occasion for his indecisiveness when struggling to deal with crosses. A flamboyant and instinctive keeper, he was also extremely agile and possessed excellent reflexes, which enabled him to produce spectacular, acrobatic and decisive reaction saves; he also possessed a good positional sense.

In addition to his shot-stopping abilities, Barthez was also known to be a passionate, popular, and highly recognisable footballing figure, who stood out for his outgoing personality, self-assurance, and composure under pressure, as well as his leadership from the back and authoritative presence in goal. Furthermore, Barthez was highly regarded for his exceptional skills with the ball at his feet, as well as his accurate distribution with his left foot, which enabled him to play the ball out from the back or launch an attack with his quick throws or long goal kicks; his confidence in possession often led him to be involved in the build-up of plays, and he often operated outside the penalty area, and would even occasionally attempt to dribble with the ball past opposing strikers with feints such as nutmegs or stepovers. He was also very quick off his line, and often acted as a sweeper-keeper, thus contributing to the evolution of the role. While he received plaudits for his goalkeeping ability in the media, throughout his career Barthez also frequently came under criticism from pundits for his stubbornness, and his aggressive, unorthodox and eccentric style of play, as well as for taking unnecessary risks; he was also deemed to be inconsistent, unreliable and prone to errors and lapses in concentration.

==Personal life==
Through his career, Barthez was known for his active romantic life, and dated Canadian model Linda Evangelista. She became pregnant but miscarried, six months into the pregnancy. The couple broke up in 2000, reunited in 2001, and then officially ended their relationship in 2002. Barthez is a smoker. Known for his eccentric and superstitious personality, Barthez often wore red briefs underneath his goalkeeping shorts, and usually cut off the sleeves of his goalkeeping jersey. Although most starting goalkeepers are usually assigned the number 1 shirt, he instead chose to wear the number 16 shirt.

==Endorsements==
During his playing career, Barthez signed advertising deals with McDonald&#x27;s and Adidas.

<text>A deposition in the law of the United States, or examination for discovery in the law of Canada, involves the taking of sworn, out-of-court oral testimony of a witness that may be reduced to a written transcript for later use in court or for discovery purposes. Depositions are commonly used in litigation in the United States and Canada. They are almost always conducted outside court by the lawyers themselves, with no judge present to supervise the examination.

==History==

Depositions by written interrogatories first appeared around the mid-15th century as a procedure for discovery, factfinding, and evidence preservation in suits in equity in English courts. They differed radically from modern depositions in three ways: (1) the party seeking a witness&#x27;s testimony merely propounded written interrogatories which were read out loud by a master or court-appointed commissioner to the witness in a closed proceeding without parties or counsel present; (2) the witness&#x27;s first-person oral answers under oath were not recorded verbatim, but were summarized by the master, commissioner, or a clerk appointed by them into a third-person continuous narrative; and (3) the resulting written product (also called a &quot;deposition&quot;) was filed with the court under seal and its contents were not revealed or &quot;published&quot; to the parties until shortly before trial. 

The modern deposition by oral examination began to develop in New York in the early 19th century when Chancellor James Kent of the New York Court of Chancery allowed masters to actually examine witnesses (that is, pursue lines of questions in real time based on the witness&#x27;s preceding answers) rather than read static interrogatories (which tended to be broadly worded and resulted in very inefficient depositions). He also allowed parties and counsel to be present during depositions. This meant depositions were no longer secret and led to counsel insisting on taking over the examinations themselves. These developments gradually spread across the United States and Canada.

During the late 19th century, summary narratives by court-appointed examiners were replaced by verbatim transcripts by court reporters. Finally, the merger of common law and equity procedure led to the adoption of live testimony in open court as the default method of taking trial evidence in all trials (equity had used depositions by written interrogatories in lieu of live testimony), which reduced the deposition to its modern role in American civil procedure as a discovery and evidence preservation device.

==By country==

===Canada===
In Canada, the process is nearly identical to that followed in the United States, but the proceeding is called an examination for discovery. Typically, the questions for the witness will be a mixture of direct questions and cross-examinations on prior statements. While most of the same objections to form are applicable as in the United States, the witness&#x27;s lawyer may additionally take certain questions &quot;under advisement&quot; as a means of delaying answering the question, without making a formal objection.

The process is considered in Canada to be time-consuming and expensive when conducted without limits. As a result, Rule 31.05.1 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure has, since January 1, 2010, limited examinations for discovery to seven hours per party except with consent of the other parties or the leave of the court. British Columbia implemented similar reforms on July 1, 2010, although the new Rule 7-2(2) can be read in two ways, it appears to be that each party can examine each other party for a maximum of seven hours unless the court orders otherwise. The alternative reading is that each party is only to be examined for a maximum of seven hours.

===China===

In mainland China, it is generally illegal to take depositions for use in foreign courts.

===United States===
&quot;Deposition&quot; is the preferred term in U.S. federal courts and in the majority of U.S. states. In some unusual situations, depositions can be taken during or even after trial.

====Civil procedure====
In almost all cases pending in United States federal courts, depositions are carried out under Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. About 35 states use versions of the FRCP in their state courts. Other states have discovery rules that are set out either in court rules or statutes, and which vary somewhat from one state to another. According to FRCP Rule 30, the number of depositions is limited to ten depositions per side (i.e. plaintiffs and defendants), with deposition of each deponent limited to a single day of no more than seven hours (unless specified otherwise in local rules of the district).

The person to be &quot;deposed&quot; (questioned) at a deposition, known as the &quot;deponent&quot;, is usually notified to appear at the appropriate time and place by means of a subpoena. Frequently, the most desired witness (the deponent) is an opposite party to the action. In that instance, legal notice may be given to that person&#x27;s attorney, and a subpoena is not required. However, if the witness is not a party to the lawsuit (a third party) or is reluctant to testify, then a subpoena must be served on that party. To ensure an accurate record of statements made during a deposition, a court reporter is present and typically transcribes the deposition by digital recording or stenographic means. Depending upon the amount in controversy and the ability of the witness to appear at trial, audio or video recordings of the deposition are sometimes taken as well.

=====Conduct of depositions=====
Depositions usually take place at the office of the court reporter or in the office of one of the law firms involved in a case. However, depositions are also sometimes taken at a witness&#x27;s workplace or home, or in a nearby hotel&#x27;s conference room. Generally, the deposition is attended by the person who is to be deposed, their attorney, court reporter, and other parties in the case who can appear personally or be represented by their counsels. Any party to the action and their attorneys have the right to be present and to ask questions.

Prior to taking a deposition, the court reporter administers the same oath or affirmation that the deponent would take if the testimony were being given in court in front of a judge and jury. Thereafter, the court reporter makes a verbatim digital or stenographic record of all that is said during the deposition, in the same manner that witness testimony is recorded in court. Some jurisdictions allow stenomask technology in lieu of traditional stenographic equipment, although many jurisdictions still prohibit stenomask because of its disconcerting effect on some lawyers and witnesses.

Attorneys for the deposing litigant are often present, although this is not required in all jurisdictions. The attorney who has ordered the deposition begins questioning of the deponent (this is referred to as &quot;direct examination&quot; or &quot;direct&quot; for short). Since nods and gestures cannot be recorded, the witness is instructed to answer all questions aloud. After the direct examination, other attorneys in attendance have an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. The first attorney may ask more questions at the end, in &quot;re-direct&quot;, which may be followed by &quot;re-cross&quot;.

During the course of the deposition, one attorney or another may object to questions asked. In most jurisdictions, only two types of objections are allowed: The first is to assert a privilege and the second is to object to the form of the question asked. Objections to form are frequently used to signal the witness to be careful in answering the question. Since the judge is not present, all other objections, in particular those involving the rules of evidence, are generally preserved until trial. They still can be made sometime at the deposition to indicate the serious problem to judge and witness, but the witness must answer the question despite these objections. If the form objection is made, the opposite party still has the right to re-phrase the same question and ask it again. Indeed, in Texas, lawyers were so aggressively using objections to indirectly coach their witnesses on the record that all objections outside four narrow categories are now prohibited and making such prohibited objections waives &quot;all&quot; objections to the question or answer at issue. California is the major &quot;outlier&quot; on deposition objections; under the California Civil Discovery Act as enacted in 1957 and heavily revised in 1986, most objections must be given on the record at the deposition (and must be specific as to the objectionable nature of the question or response) or they are permanently waived.

As with oral examination at trial, depositions can become heated at times, with some attorneys asking harassing questions to provoke witnesses into losing their tempers, some witnesses giving evasive answers, and occasional use of profane language. In extreme situations, one side or the other may ask the reporter to mark the record, then may suspend the deposition, demand a rush transcript, and file an emergency motion to compel a response, for a protective order, or for sanctions. Some courts have magistrates or discovery commissioners who are on call for such contingencies, and the parties are supposed to use them to referee such disputes over the telephone or via email before resorting to filing motions. In extreme circumstances where the relationship between the lawyers, parties, or witnesses has totally broken down, the court may require the use of a discovery referee who will have authority to sit in on depositions and rule immediately on objections as they are presented, may order that all further depositions take place in court in the presence of a judge, or may grant terminating sanctions if the record is already clear as to which party or attorney is responsible for the breakdown in civility.

Parties can bring documents to the deposition and ask document identification questions to build a foundation for making the documents admissible as evidence at trial, as long as the deponent admits their authenticity. The court reporter and all parties in the case are usually provided a copy of the documents during the deposition for review.

In recent years, developments in litigation technology has allowed the use of paper documents to be replaced by electronic documents and exhibits in the deposition. In such cases, the examining attorney marks and distributes the official exhibits electronically using a laptop or tablet device. The deponent, court reporter, and all parties receive digital official exhibits or courtesy copies. Combined with live transcript feed technology and legal videography, digital exhibit technology has made participation in remote depositions more functional and popular.

Under FRCP 30(d)(1) and its state counterparts, a deposition normally must take place for no longer than seven hours on one day per each deponent, unless otherwise stipulated by the parties or ordered by the court. The deposing party who knows that a deposition will require more than seven hours on one day must either ask the deponent to stipulate to more time, or, if the deponent is uncooperative, promptly file a motion for a longer deposition. For many years, California was the major exception to this rule, in that its Civil Discovery Act had &quot;no&quot; default time limit; depositions could theoretically proceed indefinitely, or at least until the deposition became so obviously excessive and burdensome that the deponent was able to move for a protective order. However, in January 2013, the California legislature amended the Civil Discovery Act to fall in line with the federal rule, by requiring that depositions will typically be limited to seven hours of total testimony. This new rule does not apply to &quot;any case brought by an employee or applicant for employment against an employer for acts or omissions arising out of or relating to the employment relationship.&quot;
After the deposition, the transcript is then published in the form of a hardcopy booklet, which is provided to the deponent as well as to any party to the suit who wishes to purchase a copy. The booklet will have the case caption (the name of the court, case number, and names of the parties) on the front. Inside, the pages have line numbers along the left margin, so that the parties can precisely cite testimony by page and line in later court documents. Timestamps are inserted into the margin if a video recording is being made; in the event the witness is unavailable for trial, the parties or the court will use the timestamps to identify admissible segments which a video editor will stitch together to present to the jury. A concordance is automatically generated by the stenographic system&#x27;s software and included in the back of the booklet. Finally, the booklet includes the court reporter&#x27;s certificate in which they formally certify the truth and accuracy of the transcript. (In some states, the court reporter is also a notary public.) Most court reporters can also provide a digital copy of the transcript in ASCII, RealLegal, and PDF formats.

The court reporter also keeps a copy of the documents provided to the deponent during the deposition for document identification questions, unless digital document and exhibit technology is employed, in which case the deponent and all parties receive the official exhibits in real time. The deponent normally has the right to read and sign the deposition transcript before it is filed with the court. The deponent cannot change his testimony as recorded by the court reporter in the deposition transcript, but under rule 30(e) the deponent can correct on an additional &quot;errata sheet&quot; any mistakes in the deposition transcript shortly after the transcript has been typed and bound.

The errata sheet allows the deponent to make any modifications that make &quot;changes in form or substance,&quot; giving the deponent the option to alter their record from the original transcript. Issues may arise where a party attempts to make substantive changes to testimony through errata sheets.

=====Use of depositions=====
The chief values of obtaining a deposition, as with any discovery proceeding, is to give all litigant parties in a contested case a fair preview of the evidence, and to provide support documents for further trials and dispositive motions. The process provides a &quot;level playing field&quot; of information among the litigants and avoids surprises at trial (traditionally regarded as an unfair tactic). Another benefit of taking depositions is to preserve a witness&#x27;s recollection while it is still fresh, since the trial may still be months or years away. When a witness&#x27;s testimony in open court is inconsistent with that given at deposition, a party can introduce the deposition to impeach (or contradict) the witness. In the event a witness is unavailable for trial (usually because they are deceased, seriously ill, or live hundreds of miles away), their deposition may be read or played before the jury and made part of the record in the case, with the same legal force as live testimony. In some states, stenographic, audio, or video records of depositions can be offered into evidence even if the witness is available. Deposition of the opposite party is often used to produce self-incriminating statements from the deponent, also document identification questions can make exhibits admissible for hearings and summary judgment motions.

Sometimes, after a number of witnesses have been deposed, the parties will have enough information that they can reasonably predict the outcome of a prospective trial, and may decide to arrive at a compromise settlement, thus avoiding trial and preventing additional costs of litigation. Accordingly, while most depositions are not videotaped, opposing counsel may use the opportunity to get an impression of the witness&#x27;s affect and appearance, because these are telling factors as to how that person will present in front of a jury. Furthermore, deposition transcripts are frequently submitted in support of motions for summary judgment as evidence that there is no triable issue of fact. The moving party may use transcripts to argue that even if all the testimony given at deposition was given again at trial, no reasonable factfinder could find in the opponent&#x27;s favor on a material issue of fact. The rationale is that generally, a witness must give consistent testimony on all material issues of fact both at deposition &quot;and&quot; at trial (unless there is a very good reason for changing one&#x27;s answers), or else the inconsistencies can and will be used to impeach his credibility.

====Criminal procedure====
In some United States jurisdictions, depositions may be taken in criminal cases, for reasons that vary between jurisdictions. In federal criminal cases, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 15 governs the taking of depositions. Each state has its own laws which govern the taking of depositions.

Most jurisdictions provide that depositions may be taken to perpetuate the testimony of a witness, that is, preserve their testimony for trial. If the person requested to testify (deponent) is a party to the lawsuit or someone who works for an involved party, notice of time and place of the examination before trial can be given to the other side&#x27;s attorney, but if the witness is an independent third party, a subpoena must be served on him/her if he/she is recalcitrant. This occurs when a witness may not be able to testify at trial. The deposition of the witness is taken and, if the witness is unable to appear at trial, the deposition may be used to establish the witness&#x27; testimony in lieu of the witness actually testifying. Regarding depositions to preserve testimony, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution establishes a constitutional right of the defendant to be present during the deposition and to cross-examine the witness. The defendant may waive this right.

Some jurisdictions provide that depositions may be taken for purposes of discovery. In these jurisdictions, the defendant does not have a constitutional right to be present, although such a right may be established by statute.

Some jurisdictions require that because of the sensitive nature of taking a deposition of a minor, it must be videotaped.

A defendant in a criminal case may not be deposed without their consent because of the Fifth Amendment right to not give testimony against oneself.

<doc id="51698" wikidata="Q2039387" url="?curid=51698" title="Extended real number line">
<text>In mathematics, the extended real number system is obtained from the real number system formula_1 by adding two elements denoted formula_2 and formula_3 that are respectively greater and lower than every real number. This allows for treating the potential infinities of infinitely increasing sequences and infinitely decreasing series as actual infinities. For example, the infinite sequence formula_4 of the natural numbers increases &quot;infinitively&quot; and has no upper bound in the real number system (a potential infinity); in the extended real number line, the sequence has formula_2 as its least upper bound and as its limit (an actual infinity). In calculus and mathematical analysis, the use of formula_2 and formula_3 as actual limits extends significantly the possible computations. It is the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of the real numbers.

The extended real number system is denoted formula_8, formula_9, or formula_10. When the meaning is clear from context, the symbol formula_2 is often written simply as formula_12.

There is also a distinct projectively extended real line where formula_2 and formula_3 are not distinguished, i.e., there is a single actual infinity for both infinitely increasing sequences and infinitely decreasing sequences that is denoted as just formula_12 or as formula_16.

==Motivation==
===Limits===
The extended number line is often useful to describe the behavior of a function formula_17 when either the argument formula_18 or the function value formula_17 gets &quot;infinitely large&quot; in some sense. For example, consider the function formula_17 defined by

:formula_21.

The graph of this function has a horizontal asymptote at formula_22. Geometrically, when moving increasingly farther to the right along the formula_18-axis, the value of formula_24 approaches 0. This limiting behavior is similar to the limit of a function formula_25 in which the real number formula_18 approaches formula_27 except that there is no real number that formula_18 approaches when formula_18 increases infinitely. Adjoining the elements formula_2 and formula_3 to formula_1 enables a definition of &quot;limits at infinity&quot; which is very similar to the usual defininion of limits, except that formula_33 is replaced by formula_34 (for formula_2) or formula_36 (for formula_3). This allows proving and writing
:formula_38

===Measure and integration===

In measure theory, it is often useful to allow sets that have infinite measure and integrals whose value may be infinite.

Such measures arise naturally out of calculus. For example, in assigning a measure to formula_1 that agrees with the usual length of intervals, this measure must be larger than any finite real number. Also, when considering improper integrals, such as

:formula_40

the value &quot;infinity&quot; arises. Finally, it is often useful to consider the limit of a sequence of functions, such as 

:formula_41.

Without allowing functions to take on infinite values, such essential results as the monotone convergence theorem and the dominated convergence theorem would not make sense.

==Order and topological properties==

The extended real number system formula_8, defined as formula_9 or formula_10, can be turned into a totally ordered set by defining formula_45 for all formula_46. With this order topology, formula_8 has the desirable property of compactness: Every subset of formula_48 has a supremum and an infimum (the infimum of the empty set is formula_2, and its supremum is formula_3). Moreover, with this topology, formula_48 is homeomorphic to the unit interval formula_52. Thus the topology is metrizable, corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this interval. There is no metric, however, that is an extension of the ordinary metric on formula_1.

In this topology, a set formula_54 is a neighborhood of formula_2 if and only if it contains a set formula_56 for some real number formula_57. The notion of the neighborhood of formula_3 can be defined similarly. Using this characterization of extended-real neighborhoods, limits with formula_18 tending to formula_2 or formula_3, and limits &quot;equal&quot; to formula_2 and formula_3, reduce to the general topological definition of limits—instead of having a special definition in the real number system.

==Arithmetic operations==

The arithmetic operations of formula_1 can be partially extended to formula_48 as follows:

:formula_66

For exponentiation, see . Here, formula_67 means both formula_68 and formula_69, while formula_70 means both formula_71 and formula_72.

The expressions formula_73, formula_74, and formula_75 (called indeterminate forms) are usually left undefined. These rules are modeled on the laws for infinite limits. However, in the context of probability or measure theory, formula_76 is often defined as 0.

When dealing with both positive and negative extended real numbers, the expression formula_77 is usually left undefined, because, although it is true that for every real nonzero sequence formula_17 that converges to 0, the reciprocal sequence formula_79 is eventually contained in every neighborhood of formula_80, it is &quot;not&quot; true that the sequence formula_79 must itself converge to either formula_3 or formula_83 Said another way, if a continuous function formula_17 achieves a zero at a certain value formula_27 then it need not be the case that formula_79 tends to either formula_3 or formula_12 in the limit as formula_18 tends to formula_90. This is the case for the limits of the identity function formula_91 when formula_18 tends to 0, and of formula_93 (for the latter function, neither formula_3 nor formula_12 is a limit of formula_96, even if only positive values of formula_18 are considered).

However, in contexts where only non-negative values are considered, it is often convenient to define formula_98. For example, when working with power series, the radius of convergence of a power series with coefficients formula_99 is often defined as the reciprocal of the limit-supremum of the sequence formula_100. Thus, if one allows formula_77 to take the value formula_2, then one can use this formula regardless of whether the limit-supremum is 0 or not.

==Algebraic properties==

With the arithmetic operations defined above, formula_48 is not even a semigroup, let alone a group, a ring or a field as in the case of formula_1. However, it has several convenient properties:
* formula_105 and formula_106 are either equal or both undefined.
* formula_107 and formula_108 are either equal or both undefined.
* formula_109 and formula_110 are either equal or both undefined.
* formula_111 and formula_112 are either equal or both undefined
* formula_113 and formula_114 are equal if both are defined.
* If formula_115 and if both formula_116 and formula_117 are defined, then formula_118.
* If formula_115 and formula_120 and if both formula_121 and formula_122 are defined, then formula_123.

In general, all laws of arithmetic are valid in formula_48 as long as all occurring expressions are defined.

==Miscellaneous==

Several functions can be continuously extended to formula_48 by taking limits. For instance, one may define the extremal points of the following functions as:
:formula_126,
:formula_127,
:formula_128,
:formula_129.

Some singularities may additionally be removed. For example, the function formula_130 can be continuously extended to formula_48 (under &quot;some&quot; definitions of continuity), by setting the value to formula_2 for formula_133, and 0 for formula_134 and formula_135. On the other hand, the function formula_136 can&quot;not&quot; be continuously extended, because the function approaches formula_3 as formula_18 approaches 0 from below, and formula_2 as formula_18 approaches 0 from above, i.e., the function not converging to the same value as its independent variable approaching to the same domain element from both the positive and negative value sides.

A similar but different real-line system, the projectively extended real line, does not distinguish between formula_2 and formula_3 (i.e. infinity is unsigned). As a result, a function may have limit formula_12 on the projectively extended real line, while in the extended real number system only the absolute value of the function has a limit, e.g. in the case of the function formula_136 at formula_133. On the other hand, on the projectively extended real line, formula_146 and formula_147 correspond to only a limit from the right and one from the left, respectively, with the full limit only existing when the two are equal. Thus, the functions formula_148 and formula_149 cannot be made continuous at formula_150 on the projectively extended real line.

<doc id="51702" wikidata="Q1045706" url="?curid=51702" title="Superscalar processor">
<text>A superscalar processor (or multiple-issue processor) is a CPU that implements a form of parallelism called instruction-level parallelism within a single processor. In contrast to a scalar processor, which can execute at most one single instruction per clock cycle, a superscalar processor can execute or start executing more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions to different execution units on the processor. It therefore allows more throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time which can even be less than 1) than would otherwise be possible at a given clock rate. Each execution unit is not a separate processor (or a core if the processor is a multi-core processor), but an execution resource within a single CPU such as an arithmetic logic unit.

While a superscalar CPU is typically also pipelined, superscalar and pipelining execution are considered different performance enhancement techniques. The former (superscalar) executes multiple instructions in parallel by using multiple execution units, whereas the latter (pipeline) executes multiple instructions in the same execution unit in parallel by dividing the execution unit into different phases. In the &quot;Simple superscalar pipeline&quot; figure, fetching two instructions at the same time is superscaling, and fetching the next two before the first pair has been written back is pipelining.

The superscalar technique is traditionally associated with several identifying characteristics (within a given CPU):
* Instructions are issued from a sequential instruction stream
* The CPU dynamically checks for data dependencies between instructions at run time (versus software checking at compile time)
* The CPU can execute multiple instructions per clock cycle

==History==
Seymour Cray&#x27;s CDC 6600 from 1964, while not capable of issuing multiple instructions per cycle, is often cited as an early influence to modern superscalar processors for its ability to execute instructions simultaneously through multiple functional units. The 1967 IBM System/360 Model 91, was another early influence that introduced out-of-order execution, pioneering use of Tomasulo&#x27;s algorithm. The Intel i960CA (1989), the AMD 29000-series 29050 (1990), and the Motorola MC88110 (1991), microprocessors were the first commercial single-chip superscalar microprocessors. RISC microprocessors like these were the first to have superscalar execution, because RISC architectures free transistors and die area which can be used to include multiple execution units and the traditional uniformity of the instruction set favors superscalar dispatch (this was why RISC designs were faster than CISC designs through the 1980s and into the 1990s, and it&#x27;s far more complicated to do multiple dispatch when instructions have variable bit length).

Except for CPUs used in low-power applications, embedded systems, and battery-powered devices, essentially all general-purpose CPUs developed since about 1998 are superscalar.

The P5 Pentium was the first superscalar x86 processor; the Nx586, P6 Pentium Pro and AMD K5 were among the first designs which decode x86-instructions asynchronously into dynamic microcode-like &quot;micro-op&quot; sequences prior to actual execution on a superscalar microarchitecture; this opened up for dynamic scheduling of buffered &quot;partial&quot; instructions and enabled more parallelism to be extracted compared to the more rigid methods used in the simpler P5 Pentium; it also simplified speculative execution and allowed higher clock frequencies compared to designs such as the advanced Cyrix 6x86.

==Scalar to superscalar==
The simplest processors are scalar processors. Each instruction executed by a scalar processor typically manipulates one or two data items at a time. By contrast, each instruction executed by a vector processor operates simultaneously on many data items. An analogy is the difference between scalar and vector arithmetic. A superscalar processor is a mixture of the two. Each instruction processes one data item, but there are multiple execution units within each CPU thus multiple instructions can be processing separate data items concurrently.

Superscalar CPU design emphasizes improving the instruction dispatcher accuracy and allowing it to keep the multiple execution units in use at all times. This has become increasingly important as the number of units has increased. While early superscalar CPUs would have two ALUs and a single FPU, a later design such as the PowerPC 970 includes four ALUs, two FPUs, and two SIMD units. If the dispatcher is ineffective at keeping all of these units fed with instructions, the performance of the system will be no better than that of a simpler, cheaper design.

A superscalar processor usually sustains an execution rate in excess of one instruction per machine cycle. But merely processing multiple instructions concurrently does not make an architecture superscalar, since pipelined, multiprocessor or multi-core architectures also achieve that, but with different methods.

In a superscalar CPU the dispatcher reads instructions from memory and decides which ones can be run in parallel, dispatching each to one of the several execution units contained inside a single CPU. Therefore, a superscalar processor can be envisioned as having multiple parallel pipelines, each of which is processing instructions simultaneously from a single instruction thread.

Most modern superscalar CPUs also have logic to reorder the instructions to try to avoid pipeline stalls and increase parallel execution.

==Limitations==
Available performance improvement from superscalar techniques is limited by three key areas:

* The degree of intrinsic parallelism in the instruction stream (instructions requiring the same computational resources from the CPU)
* The complexity and time cost of dependency checking logic and register renaming circuitry
* The branch instruction processing

Existing binary executable programs have varying degrees of intrinsic parallelism. In some cases instructions are not dependent on each other and can be executed simultaneously. In other cases they are inter-dependent: one instruction impacts either resources or results of the other. The instructions codice_1 can be run in parallel because none of the results depend on other calculations. However, the instructions codice_2 might not be runnable in parallel, depending on the order in which the instructions complete while they move through the units.

Although the instruction stream may contain no inter-instruction dependencies, a superscalar CPU must nonetheless check for that possibility, since there is no assurance otherwise and failure to detect a dependency would produce incorrect results.

No matter how advanced the semiconductor process or how fast the switching speed, this places a practical limit on how many instructions can be simultaneously dispatched. While process advances will allow ever greater numbers of execution units (e.g. ALUs), the burden of checking instruction dependencies grows rapidly, as does the complexity of register renaming circuitry to mitigate some dependencies. Collectively the power consumption, complexity and gate delay costs limit the achievable superscalar speedup.

However even given infinitely fast dependency checking logic on an otherwise conventional superscalar CPU, if the instruction stream itself has many dependencies, this would also limit the possible speedup. Thus the degree of intrinsic parallelism in the code stream forms a second limitation.

==Alternatives==
Collectively, these limits drive investigation into alternative architectural changes such as very long instruction word (VLIW), explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC), simultaneous multithreading (SMT), and multi-core computing.

With VLIW, the burdensome task of dependency checking by hardware logic at run time is removed and delegated to the compiler. Explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC) is like VLIW with extra cache prefetching instructions.

Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is a technique for improving the overall efficiency of superscalar processors. SMT permits multiple independent threads of execution to better utilize the resources provided by modern processor architectures. The fact that they are independent means that we know that the instruction of one thread can be executed out of order and/or in parallel with the instruction of a different one. Also, one independent thread will not produce a pipeline bubble in the code stream of a different one, for example, due to a branch. 

Superscalar processors differ from multi-core processors in that the several execution units are not entire processors. A single processor is composed of finer-grained execution units such as the ALU, integer multiplier, integer shifter, FPU, etc. There may be multiple versions of each execution unit to enable the execution of many instructions in parallel. This differs from a multi-core processor that concurrently processes instructions from &quot;multiple&quot; threads, one thread per processing unit (called &quot;core&quot;). It also differs from a pipelined processor, where the multiple instructions can concurrently be in various stages of execution, assembly-line fashion.

The various alternative techniques are not mutually exclusive—they can be (and frequently are) combined in a single processor. Thus a multicore CPU is possible where each core is an independent processor containing multiple parallel pipelines, each pipeline being superscalar. Some processors also include vector capability.

<doc id="51706" wikidata="Q249743" url="?curid=51706" title="Very long instruction word">
<text>Very long instruction word (VLIW) refers to instruction set architectures that are designed to exploit instruction-level parallelism (ILP). A VLIW processor allows programs to explicitly specify instructions to execute in parallel, whereas conventional central processing units (CPUs) mostly allow programs to specify instructions to execute in sequence only. VLIW is intended to allow higher performance without the complexity inherent in some other designs.

The traditional means to improve performance in processors include dividing instructions into sub steps so the instructions can be executed partly at the same time (termed &quot;pipelining&quot;), dispatching individual instructions to be executed independently, in different parts of the processor (&quot;superscalar architectures&quot;), and even executing instructions in an order different from the program (&quot;out-of-order execution&quot;). These methods all complicate hardware (larger circuits, higher cost and energy use) because the processor must make all of the decisions internally for these methods to work.

In contrast, the VLIW method depends on the programs providing all the decisions regarding which instructions to execute simultaneously and how to resolve conflicts. As a practical matter, this means that the compiler (software used to create the final programs) becomes more complex, but the hardware is simpler than in many other means of parallelism.

== History ==

The concept of VLIW architecture, and the term &quot;VLIW&quot;, were invented by Josh Fisher in his research group at Yale University in the early 1980s. His original development of trace scheduling as a compiling method for VLIW was developed when he was a graduate student at New York University. Before VLIW, the notion of prescheduling execution units and instruction-level parallelism in software was well established in the practice of developing horizontal microcode. Before Fisher the theoretical aspects of what would be later called VLIW were developed by the Soviet computer scientist Mikhail Kartsev based on his Sixties work on military-oriented M-9 and M-10 computers. His ideas were later developed and published as a part of a textbook two years before Fisher&#x27;s seminal paper, but because of the Iron Curtain and because Kartsev&#x27;s work was mostly military-related it remained largely unknown in the West.

Fisher&#x27;s innovations involved developing a compiler that could target horizontal microcode from programs written in an ordinary programming language. He realized that to get good performance and target a wide-issue machine, it would be necessary to find parallelism beyond that generally within a basic block. He also developed region scheduling methods to identify parallelism beyond basic blocks. Trace scheduling is such a method, and involves scheduling the most likely path of basic blocks first, inserting compensating code to deal with speculative motions, scheduling the second most likely trace, and so on, until the schedule is complete.

Fisher&#x27;s second innovation was the notion that the target CPU architecture should be designed to be a reasonable target for a compiler; that the compiler and the architecture for a VLIW processor must be codesigned. This was inspired partly by the difficulty Fisher observed at Yale of compiling for architectures like Floating Point Systems&#x27; FPS164, which had a complex instruction set computing (CISC) architecture that separated instruction initiation from the instructions that saved the result, needing very complex scheduling algorithms. Fisher developed a set of principles characterizing a proper VLIW design, such as self-draining pipelines, wide multi-port register files, and memory architectures. These principles made it easier for compilers to emit fast code.

The first VLIW compiler was described in a Ph.D. thesis by John Ellis, supervised by Fisher. The compiler was named Bulldog, after Yale&#x27;s mascot.

Fisher left Yale in 1984 to found a startup company, Multiflow, along with cofounders John O&#x27;Donnell and John Ruttenberg. Multiflow produced the TRACE series of VLIW minisupercomputers, shipping their first machines in 1987. Multiflow&#x27;s VLIW could issue 28 operations in parallel per instruction. The TRACE system was implemented in a mix of medium-scale integration (MSI), large-scale integration (LSI), and very large-scale integration (VLSI), packaged in cabinets, a technology obsoleted as it grew more cost-effective to integrate all of the components of a processor (excluding memory) on one chip.

Multiflow was too early to catch the following wave, when chip architectures began to allow multiple-issue CPUs. The major semiconductor companies recognized the value of Multiflow technology in this context, so the compiler and architecture were subsequently licensed to most of these firms.

== Motivation ==

A processor that executes every instruction one after the other (i.e., a non-pipelined scalar architecture) may use processor resources inefficiently, yielding potential poor performance. The performance can be improved by executing different substeps of sequential instructions simultaneously (termed &quot;pipelining&quot;), or even executing multiple instructions entirely simultaneously as in superscalar architectures. Further improvement can be achieved by executing instructions in an order different from that in which they occur in a program, termed out-of-order execution.

These three methods all raise hardware complexity. Before executing any operations in parallel, the processor must verify that the instructions have no interdependencies. For example, if a first instruction&#x27;s result is used as a second instruction&#x27;s input, then they cannot execute at the same time and the second instruction cannot execute before the first. Modern out-of-order processors have increased the hardware resources which schedule instructions and determine interdependencies.

In contrast, VLIW executes operations in parallel, based on a fixed schedule, determined when programs are compiled. Since determining the order of execution of operations (including which operations can execute simultaneously) is handled by the compiler, the processor does not need the scheduling hardware that the three methods described above require. Thus, VLIW CPUs offer more computing with less hardware complexity (but greater compiler complexity) than do most superscalar CPUs. This is also complementary to the idea that as many computations as possible should be done before the program is executed, at compile time.

== Design ==

In superscalar designs, the number of execution units is invisible to the instruction set. Each instruction encodes one operation only. For most superscalar designs, the instruction width is 32 bits or fewer.

In contrast, one VLIW instruction encodes multiple operations, at least one operation for each execution unit of a device. For example, if a VLIW device has five execution units, then a VLIW instruction for the device has five operation fields, each field specifying what operation should be done on that corresponding execution unit. To accommodate these operation fields, VLIW instructions are usually at least 64 bits wide, and far wider on some architectures.

For example, the following is an instruction for the Super Harvard Architecture Single-Chip Computer (SHARC). In one cycle, it does a floating-point multiply, a floating-point add, and two autoincrement loads. All of this fits in one 48-bit instruction:

codice_1

Since the earliest days of computer architecture, some CPUs have added several arithmetic logic units (ALUs) to run in parallel. Superscalar CPUs use hardware to decide which operations can run in parallel at runtime, while VLIW CPUs use software (the compiler) to decide which operations can run in parallel in advance. Because the complexity of instruction scheduling is moved into the compiler, complexity of hardware can be reduced substantially.

A similar problem occurs when the result of a parallelizable instruction is used as input for a branch. Most modern CPUs &quot;guess&quot; which branch will be taken even before the calculation is complete, so that they can load the instructions for the branch, or (in some architectures) even start to compute them speculatively. If the CPU guesses wrong, all of these instructions and their context need to be &quot;flushed&quot; and the correct ones loaded, which takes time.

This has led to increasingly complex instruction-dispatch logic that attempts to guess correctly, and the simplicity of the original reduced instruction set computing (RISC) designs has been eroded. VLIW lacks this logic, and thus lacks its energy use, possible design defects, and other negative aspects.

In a VLIW, the compiler uses heuristics or profile information to guess the direction of a branch. This allows it to move and preschedule operations speculatively before the branch is taken, favoring the most likely path it expects through the branch. If the branch takes an unexpected way, the compiler has already generated compensating code to discard speculative results to preserve program semantics.

Vector processor cores (designed for large one-dimensional arrays of data called &quot;vectors&quot;) can be combined with the VLIW architecture such as in the Fujitsu FR-V microprocessor, further increasing throughput and speed.

== Implementations ==

Cydrome was a company producing VLIW numeric processors using emitter-coupled logic (ECL) integrated circuits in the same timeframe (late 1980s). This company, like Multiflow, failed after a few years.

One of the licensees of the Multiflow technology is Hewlett-Packard, which Josh Fisher joined after Multiflow&#x27;s demise. Bob Rau, founder of Cydrome, also joined HP after Cydrome failed. These two would lead computer architecture research at Hewlett-Packard during the 1990s.

Along with the above systems, during the same time (1989–1990), Intel implemented VLIW in the Intel i860, their first 64-bit microprocessor, and the first processor to implement VLIW on one chip. This processor could operate in both simple RISC mode and VLIW mode:

In the early 1990s, Intel introduced the i860 RISC microprocessor. This simple chip had two modes of operation: a scalar mode and a VLIW mode. In the VLIW mode, the processor always fetched two instructions and assumed that one was an integer instruction and the other floating-point.
The i860&#x27;s VLIW mode was used extensively in embedded digital signal processor (DSP) applications since the application execution and datasets were simple, well ordered and predictable, allowing designers to fully exploit the parallel execution advantages enabled by VLIW. In VLIW mode, the i860 could maintain floating-point performance in the range of 20-40 double-precision MFLOPS; a very high value for its time and for a processor running at 25-50Mhz.

In the 1990s, Hewlett-Packard researched this problem as a side effect of ongoing work on their PA-RISC processor family. They found that the CPU could be greatly simplified by removing the complex dispatch logic from the CPU and placing it in the compiler. Compilers of the day were far more complex than those of the 1980s, so the added complexity in the compiler was considered to be a small cost.

VLIW CPUs are usually made of multiple RISC-like execution units that operate independently. Contemporary VLIWs usually have four to eight main execution units. Compilers generate initial instruction sequences for the VLIW CPU in roughly the same manner as for traditional CPUs, generating a sequence of RISC-like instructions. The compiler analyzes this code for dependence relationships and resource requirements. It then schedules the instructions according to those constraints. In this process, independent instructions can be scheduled in parallel. Because VLIWs typically represent instructions scheduled in parallel with a longer instruction word that incorporates the individual instructions, this results in a much longer opcode (termed &quot;very long&quot;) to specify what executes on a given cycle.

Examples of contemporary VLIW CPUs include the TriMedia media processors by NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors), the Super Harvard Architecture Single-Chip Computer (SHARC) DSP by Analog Devices, the ST200 family by STMicroelectronics based on the Lx architecture (designed in Josh Fisher&#x27;s HP lab by Paolo Faraboschi), the FR-V from Fujitsu, the BSP15/16 from Pixelworks, the CEVA-X DSP from CEVA, the Jazz DSP from Improv Systems, the HiveFlex series from Silicon Hive, and the MPPA Manycore family by Kalray. The Texas Instruments TMS320 DSP line has evolved, in its C6000 family, to look more like a VLIW, in contrast to the earlier C5000 family. One or more Qualcomm Hexagons can be found in most cell phones today. These contemporary VLIW CPUs are mainly successful as embedded media processors for consumer electronic devices.

VLIW features have also been added to configurable processor cores for system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. For example, Tensilica&#x27;s Xtensa LX2 processor incorporates a technology named Flexible Length Instruction eXtensions (FLIX) that allows multi-operation instructions. The Xtensa C/C++ compiler can freely intermix 32- or 64-bit FLIX instructions with the Xtensa processor&#x27;s one-operation RISC instructions, which are 16 or 24 bits wide. By packing multiple operations into a wide 32- or 64-bit instruction word and allowing these multi-operation instructions to intermix with shorter RISC instructions, FLIX allows SoC designers to realize VLIW&#x27;s performance advantages while eliminating the code bloat of early VLIW architectures.
The Infineon Carmel DSP is another VLIW processor core intended for SoC. It uses a similar code density improvement method called &quot;configurable long instruction word&quot; (CLIW).

Outside embedded processing markets, Intel&#x27;s Itanium IA-64 explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC) and Elbrus 2000 appear as the only examples of a widely used VLIW CPU architectures. However, EPIC architecture is sometimes distinguished from a pure VLIW architecture, since EPIC advocates full instruction predication, rotating register files, and a very long instruction word that can encode non-parallel instruction groups. VLIWs also gained significant consumer penetration in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, though both Nvidia and AMD have since moved to RISC architectures to improve performance on non-graphics workloads.

ATI Technologies&#x27; (ATI) and Advanced Micro Devices&#x27; (AMD) TeraScale microarchitecture for graphics processing units (GPUs) is a VLIW microarchitecture.

In December 2015, the first shipment of PCs based on VLIW CPU Elbrus-4s was made in Russia.

The Neo by REX Computing is a processor consisting of a 2D mesh of VLIW cores aimed at power efficiency.

The Elbrus 2000 () and its successors are Russian 512-bit wide VLIW microprocessors developed by Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies (MCST) and fabricated by TSMC.

== Backward compatibility ==
When silicon technology allowed for wider implementations (with more execution units) to be built, the compiled programs for the earlier generation would not run on the wider implementations, as the encoding of binary instructions depended on the number of execution units of the machine.

Transmeta addressed this issue by including a binary-to-binary software compiler layer (termed &quot;code morphing&quot;) in their Crusoe implementation of the x86 architecture. This mechanism was advertised to basically recompile, optimize, and translate x86 opcodes at runtime into the CPU&#x27;s internal machine code. Thus, the Transmeta chip is &quot;internally&quot; a VLIW processor, effectively decoupled from the x86 CISC instruction set that it executes.

Intel&#x27;s Itanium architecture (among others) solved the backward-compatibility problem with a more general mechanism. Within each of the multiple-opcode instructions, a bit field is allocated to denote dependency on the prior VLIW instruction within the program instruction stream. These bits are set at compile time, thus relieving the hardware from calculating this dependency information. Having this dependency information encoded in the instruction stream allows wider implementations to issue multiple non-dependent VLIW instructions in parallel per cycle, while narrower implementations would issue a smaller number of VLIW instructions per cycle.

Another perceived deficiency of VLIW designs is the code bloat that occurs when one or more execution unit(s) have no useful work to do and thus must execute &quot;No Operation&quot; NOP instructions. This occurs when there are dependencies in the code and the instruction pipelines must be allowed to drain before later operations can proceed.

Since the number of transistors on a chip has grown, the perceived disadvantages of the VLIW have diminished in importance. VLIW architectures are growing in popularity, especially in the embedded system market, where it is possible to customize a processor for an application in a system-on-a-chip.

<text>The Russulales are an order of the Agaricomycetes, (which include the agaric genera &quot;Russula&quot; and &quot;Lactarius&quot; and their polyporoid and corticioid relatives). According to the &quot;Dictionary of the Fungi&quot; (10th edition, 2008), the order consists of 12 families, 80 genera, and 1767 species. According to &quot;Species Fungorum&quot; (January 2016), the order contains 13 families, 117 genera (16 not assigned to a family), and 3,060 species.

Russuloid agarics represent an independent evolutionary line of agarics, not directly related to the Agaricales.

This group also includes a number of russuloid hypogeous fungi, polypores such as &quot;Bondarzewia&quot;, some tooth fungi (e.g. &quot;Auriscalpium vulgare&quot;), and club fungi e.g. &quot;Artomyces&quot;. Basidiospores in this group are typically ornamented with amyloid warts or but a few exceptions are known, e.g. &quot;Heterobasidion annosum&quot;. The genus &quot;Clavicorona&quot; was often treated in the Russulales, but its type species, &quot;C. taxophila&quot;, is in the Agaricales. The remaining species are retained in the Russulales in the genus &quot;Artomyces&quot;.

==Genera &quot;Incertae sedis&quot;==
There are several genera classified in the Russulales that are i) poorly known, ii) have not been subjected to DNA analysis, or iii) if analysed phylogenetically do not group with as yet named or identified families, and have not been assigned to a specific family (i.e., &quot;Incertae sedis&quot; with respect to familial placement). These include:
*&quot;Aleurocystidiellum&quot;
*&quot;Dentipellopsis&quot;
*&quot;Gloeoasterostroma&quot;
*&quot;Gloeohypochnicium&quot;
*&quot;Gloeopeniophorella&quot;
*&quot;Haloaleurodiscus&quot;
*&quot;Neoalbatrellus&quot;
*&quot;Polypus&quot;
*&quot;Scopulodontia&quot;
*&quot;Scytinostromella&quot;

<text>In calculus, Taylor&#x27;s theorem gives an approximation of a formula_1-times differentiable function around a given point by a polynomial of degree formula_1, called the formula_1-th-order Taylor polynomial. For a smooth function, the Taylor polynomial is the truncation at the order &quot;formula_1&quot; of the Taylor series of the function. The first-order Taylor polynomial is the linear approximation of the function, and the second-order Taylor polynomial is often referred to as the quadratic approximation. There are several versions of Taylor&#x27;s theorem, some giving explicit estimates of the approximation error of the function by its Taylor polynomial.

Taylor&#x27;s theorem is named after the mathematician Brook Taylor, who stated a version of it in 1715, although an earlier version of the result was already mentioned in 1671 by James Gregory.

Taylor&#x27;s theorem is taught in introductory-level calculus courses and is one of the central elementary tools in mathematical analysis. It gives simple arithmetic formulas to accurately compute values of many transcendental functions such as the exponential function and trigonometric functions.
It is the starting point of the study of analytic functions, and is fundamental in various areas of mathematics, as well as in numerical analysis and mathematical physics. Taylor&#x27;s theorem also generalizes to multivariate and vector valued functions. It provided the mathematical basis for some landmark early computing machines: Charles Babbage&#x27;s Difference Engine calculated sines, cosines, logarithms, and other transcendental functions by numerically integrating the first 7 terms of their Taylor series.

== Motivation ==

If a real-valued function formula_5 is differentiable at the point formula_6, then it has a linear approximation near this point. This means that there exists a function &quot;h&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;) such that

formula_7

Here

formula_8

is the linear approximation of formula_5 for &quot;x&quot; near the point &quot;a&quot;, whose graph formula_10 is the tangent line to the graph formula_11 at . The error in the approximation is:
formula_12

As &quot;x&quot; tends to &quot;a,&quot; this error goes to zero much faster than formula_13, making formula_14 a useful approximation.
For a better approximation to formula_5, we can fit a quadratic polynomial instead of a linear function:

formula_16

Instead of just matching one derivative of formula_5 at formula_6, this polynomial has the same first and second derivatives, as is evident upon differentiation.

Taylor&#x27;s theorem ensures that the &quot;quadratic approximation&quot; is, in a sufficiently small neighborhood of formula_6, more accurate than the linear approximation. Specifically,

formula_20

Here the error in the approximation is

formula_21

which, given the limiting behavior of formula_22, goes to zero faster than formula_23 as &quot;x&quot; tends to &quot;a&quot;.

 Similarly, we might get still better approximations to &quot;f&quot; if we use polynomials of higher degree, since then we can match even more derivatives with &quot;f&quot; at the selected base point.

In general, the error in approximating a function by a polynomial of degree &quot;k&quot; will go to zero much faster than formula_24 as &quot;x&quot; tends to &quot;a&quot;. However, there are functions, even infinitely differentiable ones, for which increasing the degree of the approximating polynomial does not increase the accuracy of approximation: we say such a function fails to be analytic at &quot;x = a&quot;: it is not (locally) determined by its derivatives at this point.

Taylor&#x27;s theorem is of asymptotic nature: it only tells us that the error formula_25 in an approximation by a formula_1-th order Taylor polynomial &quot;Pk&quot; tends to zero faster than any nonzero formula_1-th degree polynomial as formula_28. It does not tell us how large the error is in any concrete neighborhood of the center of expansion, but for this purpose there are explicit formulas for the remainder term (given below) which are valid under some additional regularity assumptions on &quot;f&quot;. These enhanced versions of Taylor&#x27;s theorem typically lead to uniform estimates for the approximation error in a small neighborhood of the center of expansion, but the estimates do not necessarily hold for neighborhoods which are too large, even if the function &quot;f&quot; is analytic. In that situation one may have to select several Taylor polynomials with different centers of expansion to have reliable Taylor-approximations of the original function (see animation on the right.)

There are several ways we might use the remainder term:

# Estimate the error for a polynomial &quot;Pk&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of degree &quot;k&quot; estimating formula_5 on a given interval (&quot;a&quot; – &quot;r&quot;, &quot;a&quot; + &quot;r&quot;). (Given the interval and degree, we find the error.)
# Find the smallest degree &quot;k&quot; for which the polynomial &quot;Pk&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) approximates formula_5 to within a given error tolerance on a given interval (&quot;a&quot; − &quot;r&quot;, &quot;a&quot; + &quot;r&quot;) . (Given the interval and error tolerance, we find the degree.)
# Find the largest interval (&quot;a&quot; − &quot;r&quot;, &quot;a&quot; + &quot;r&quot;) on which &quot;Pk&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) approximates formula_5 to within a given error tolerance. (Given the degree and error tolerance, we find the interval.)

== Taylor&#x27;s theorem in one real variable ==

=== Statement of the theorem ===

The precise statement of the most basic version of Taylor&#x27;s theorem is as follows:

The polynomial appearing in Taylor&#x27;s theorem is the formula_32-th order Taylor polynomial

formula_33

of the function &quot;f&quot; at the point &quot;a&quot;. The Taylor polynomial is the unique &quot;asymptotic best fit&quot; polynomial in the sense that if there exists a function and a formula_1-th order polynomial &quot;p&quot; such that

formula_35

then &quot;p&quot; = &quot;Pk&quot;. Taylor&#x27;s theorem describes the asymptotic behavior of the remainder term

formula_36

which is the approximation error when approximating &quot;f&quot; with its Taylor polynomial. Using the little-o notation, the statement in Taylor&#x27;s theorem reads as

formula_37

=== Explicit formulas for the remainder ===

Under stronger regularity assumptions on &quot;f&quot; there are several precise formulas for the remainder term &quot;Rk&quot; of the Taylor polynomial, the most common ones being the following.

These refinements of Taylor&#x27;s theorem are usually proved using the mean value theorem, whence the name. Additionally, notice that this is precisely the mean value theorem when formula_38. Also other similar expressions can be found. For example, if &quot;G&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable with a non-vanishing derivative on the open interval between formula_39 and formula_40, then

formula_41

for some number formula_42 between formula_39 and formula_40. This version covers the Lagrange and Cauchy forms of the remainder as special cases, and is proved below using Cauchy&#x27;s mean value theorem. The Lagrange form is obtained by taking formula_45 and the Cauchy form is obtained by taking formula_46.

The statement for the integral form of the remainder is more advanced than the previous ones, and requires understanding of Lebesgue integration theory for the full generality. However, it holds also in the sense of Riemann integral provided the (&quot;k&quot; + 1)th derivative of &quot;f&quot; is continuous on the closed interval [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;x&quot;].

Due to the absolute continuity of &quot;f&quot; on the closed interval between formula_47 and formula_48, its derivative &quot;f&quot; exists as an &quot;L&quot;-function, and the result can be proven by a formal calculation using the fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts.

=== Estimates for the remainder ===

It is often useful in practice to be able to estimate the remainder term appearing in the Taylor approximation, rather than having an exact formula for it. Suppose that &quot;f&quot; is -times continuously differentiable in an interval &quot;I&quot; containing &quot;a&quot;. Suppose that there are real constants &quot;q&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; such that

formula_49

throughout &quot;I&quot;. Then the remainder term satisfies the inequality

formula_50

if , and a similar estimate if . This is a simple consequence of the Lagrange form of the remainder. In particular, if

formula_51

on an interval with some formula_52 , then

formula_53

=== Example in two dimensions ===

For example, the third-order Taylor polynomial of a smooth function formula_54 is, denoting formula_55,

formula_56

== Proofs ==

=== Proof for Taylor&#x27;s theorem in one real variable ===

Let

formula_57

where, as in the statement of Taylor&#x27;s theorem,

formula_58

It is sufficient to show that

formula_59

The proof here is based on repeated application of L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule. Note that, for each formula_60, formula_61. Hence each of the first formula_62 derivatives of the numerator in formula_63 vanishes at formula_64, and the same is true of the denominator. Also, since the condition that the function formula_65 be formula_1 times differentiable at a point requires differentiability up to order formula_62 in a neighborhood of said point (this is true, because differentiability requires a function to be defined in a whole neighborhood of a point), the numerator and its formula_68 derivatives are differentiable in a neighborhood of formula_39. Clearly, the denominator also satisfies said condition, and additionally, doesn&#x27;t vanish unless formula_6, therefore all conditions necessary for L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule are fulfilled, and its use is justified. So

formula_71

where the second-to-last equality follows by the definition of the derivative at formula_72.

=== Alternate proof for Taylor&#x27;s theorem in one real variable ===

Let formula_73 be any real-valued continuous function to be approximated by the Taylor polynomial.

Step 1: Let formula_74 and formula_75 be functions. Set formula_74 and formula_75 to be

formula_78

formula_79

Step 2: Properties of formula_74 and formula_75:

formula_82

Similarly, 

formula_83

formula_84

Step 3: Use Cauchy Mean Value Theorem

Let formula_85 and formula_86 be continuous functions on formula_87. Since formula_88 so we can work with the interval formula_89. Let formula_85 and formula_86 be differentiable on formula_92. Assume formula_93 for all formula_94.
Then there exists formula_95 such that

formula_96

Note: formula_97 in formula_98 and formula_99 so

formula_100

for some formula_95.

This can also be performed for formula_102:

formula_103

for some formula_104.
This can be continued to formula_105.

This gives a partition in formula_98:

formula_107

with

formula_108

Set formula_109:

formula_110

Step 4: Substitute back

formula_111

By the Power Rule, repeated derivatives of formula_112, formula_113, so:

formula_114

This leads to:

formula_115

By rearranging, we get:

formula_116

or because formula_117 eventually:

formula_118

=== Derivation for the mean value forms of the remainder ===

Let &quot;G&quot; be any real-valued function, continuous on the closed interval between formula_47 and formula_48 and differentiable with a non-vanishing derivative on the open interval between formula_47 and formula_48, and define

formula_123

For formula_124. Then, by Cauchy&#x27;s mean value theorem,

for some formula_42 on the open interval between formula_47 and formula_48. Note that here the numerator formula_128 is exactly the remainder of the Taylor polynomial for formula_11. Compute

formula_130

plug it into () and rearrange terms to find that

formula_131

This is the form of the remainder term mentioned after the actual statement of Taylor&#x27;s theorem with remainder in the mean value form.
The Lagrange form of the remainder is found by choosing formula_132 and the Cauchy form by choosing formula_133.

Remark. Using this method one can also recover the integral form of the remainder by choosing

formula_134

but the requirements for &quot;f&quot; needed for the use of mean value theorem are too strong, if one aims to prove the claim in the case that &quot;f&quot; is only absolutely continuous. However, if one uses Riemann integral instead of Lebesgue integral, the assumptions cannot be weakened.

=== Derivation for the integral form of the remainder ===

Due to the absolute continuity of formula_135 on the closed interval between formula_47 and formula_48, its derivative formula_138 exists as an formula_139-function, and we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts. This same proof applies for the Riemann integral assuming that formula_135 is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval between formula_47 and formula_48, and this leads to the same result as using the mean value theorem.

The fundamental theorem of calculus states that

formula_143

Now we can integrate by parts and use the fundamental theorem of calculus again to see that

formula_144

which is exactly Taylor&#x27;s theorem with remainder in the integral form in the case formula_145. The general statement is proved using induction. Suppose that
Integrating the remainder term by parts we arrive at

formula_146

Substituting this into the formula shows that if it holds for the value formula_147, it must also hold for the value formula_148. Therefore, since it holds for formula_145, it must hold for every positive integer formula_147.

=== Derivation for the remainder of multivariate Taylor polynomials ===

We prove the special case, where formula_151 has continuous partial derivatives up to the order formula_148 in some closed ball formula_153 with center formula_154. The strategy of the proof is to apply the one-variable case of Taylor&#x27;s theorem to the restriction of formula_155 to the line segment adjoining formula_156 and formula_154. Parametrize the line segment between formula_154 and formula_156 by formula_160 We apply the one-variable version of Taylor&#x27;s theorem to the function formula_161:

formula_162

Applying the chain rule for several variables gives

formula_163

where formula_164 is the multinomial coefficient. Since formula_165, we get:

formula_166

<doc id="51718" wikidata="Q939090" url="?curid=51718" title="United States Atomic Energy Commission">
<text>The United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was an agency of the United States government established after World War II by the U.S. Congress to foster and control the peacetime development of atomic science and technology. President Harry S. Truman signed the McMahon/Atomic Energy Act on August 1, 1946, transferring the control of atomic energy from military to civilian hands, effective on January 1, 1947. This shift gave the members of the AEC complete control of the plants, laboratories, equipment, and personnel assembled during the war to produce the atomic bomb.

An increasing number of critics during the 1960s charged that the AEC&#x27;s regulations were insufficiently rigorous in several important areas, including radiation protection standards, nuclear reactor safety, plant siting, and environmental protection.

By 1974, the AEC&#x27;s regulatory programs had come under such strong attack that the U.S. Congress decided to abolish the AEC. The AEC was abolished by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which assigned its functions to two new agencies: the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. On August 4, 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed into law the Department of Energy Organization Act, which created the Department of Energy. The new agency assumed the responsibilities of the Federal Energy Administration (FEA), the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), the Federal Power Commission (FPC), and various other federal agencies.

==History==
In creating the AEC, Congress declared that atomic energy should be employed not only in the form of nuclear weapons for the nation&#x27;s defense, but also to promote world peace, improve the public welfare and strengthen free competition in private enterprise. At the same time, the McMahon Act which created the AEC also gave it unprecedented powers of regulation over the entire field of nuclear science and technology. It furthermore explicitly prevented technology transfer between the United States and other countries, and required FBI investigations for all scientists or industrial contractors who wished to have access to any AEC controlled nuclear information. The signing was the culmination of long months of intensive debate among politicians, military planners and atomic scientists over the fate of this new energy source and the means by which it would be regulated. President Truman appointed David Lilienthal as the first Chairman of the AEC. 
Congress gave the new civilian AEC extraordinary power and considerable independence to carry out its mission. To provide the AEC exceptional freedom in hiring its scientists and engineers, AEC employees were exempt from the civil service system. The AEC&#x27;s first order of business was to inspect the scattered empire of atomic plants and laboratories to be inherited from the U.S. Army.

Because of the great need for security, all production facilities and nuclear reactors would be government-owned, while all technical information and research results would be under AEC control. The National Laboratory system was established from the facilities created under the Manhattan Project. Argonne National Laboratory was one of the first laboratories authorized under this legislation as a contractor-operated facility dedicated to fulfilling the new AEC&#x27;s missions. Argonne was the first of the regional laboratories to involve universities in the Chicago area. Others were the Clinton (CEW) labs and the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the Northeast, although a similar lab in Southern California did not eventuate.

On 11 March 1948 Lilienthal and Kenneth Nichols were summoned to the White House where Truman told them &quot;I know you two hate each other’s guts&quot;. He directed that &quot;the primary objective of the AEC was to develop and produce atomic weapons&quot;, Nichols was appointed a major general and replaced Leslie Groves as chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP); previously Lilienthal had opposed his appointment. Lilienthal was told to &quot;forgo your desire to place a bottle of milk on every doorstop and get down to the business of producing atomic weapons.&quot; Nichols became General Manager of the AEC on 2 November 1953.

The AEC was in charge of developing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, taking over these responsibilities from the wartime Manhattan Project. In its first decade, the AEC oversaw the operation of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, devoted primarily to weapons development, and in 1952, the creation of new second weapons laboratory in California, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The AEC also carried out the &quot;crash program&quot; to develop the hydrogen bomb (H-bomb), and the AEC played a key role in the prosecution of the Rosenbergs for espionage.

The AEC also began a program of regular nuclear weapons testing, both in the faraway Pacific Proving Grounds and at the Nevada Test Site in the western United States. While the AEC also supported much basic research, the vast majority of its early budget was devoted to nuclear weapons development and production.

After serving as director of the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer voiced strong opinions to the AEC, as chairman of its general advisory board of nuclear scientists, against development of the &quot;super&quot; or hydrogen bomb along with Lilienthal. Subsequently, Lilienthal left the AEC at the White House&#x27;s request in 1950 and Oppenheimer&#x27;s appointment to the board was not renewed in 1952. With them removed, President Truman announced his decision to develop and produce the hydrogen bomb. The first test firing of an experimental H-bomb (&quot;Ivy Mike&quot;) was carried out in the Central Pacific on November 1, 1952, under President Truman. Furthermore, U.S. Navy Admiral Lewis W. Strauss was appointed in 1953 by the new President Eisenhower as the Chairman of the AEC, to carry out the military development and production of the H-bomb.

Lilienthal wanted to give high priority to peaceful uses, especially with nuclear power plants. However, coal was still cheap, and the electric power industry was not interested. The first experimental nuclear power plant was started in Pennsylvania under President Eisenhower in 1954.

=== Domestic uranium procurement program ===
The AEC developed a program for sourcing uranium domestically. Before 1947, the main sources for the mineral had been Canada and (what was then) the Belgian Congo, though the Manhattan Project also secretly processed uranium from the tailings of vanadium plants in the US West during World War II. The Colorado Plateau was known to contain veins of carnotite ore, which contains both vanadium and uranium. The AEC developed its program in accordance with the principle of free enterprise. Rather than discovering, mining, and processing the ore itself, the federal government provided geological information, built roads, and set a fixed rate for purchasing ore through one of the mills in the area. This prompted individuals to discover and produce the ore, which the government would then buy. The AEC was the only legal buyer of uranium from the beginning of the program in 1947 through 1966. From 1966 to the end of the program in 1970, the AEC continued to buy uranium to support the market until private industry could develop sufficiently.

Because the government itself was not producing ore, it claimed that it had no obligation to regulate miner safety. A congressional report published in 1995 concluded that, &quot;The government failed to act to require the reduction of the hazard by ventilating the mines, and it failed to adequately warn the miners of the hazard to which they were being exposed.&quot; The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 sought to compensate miners and families who developed cancer as a result of exposure to radon gas in uranium mines.

===Regulations and experiments===
The AEC was connected with the U.S. Department of Defense by a &quot;Military Liaison Committee&quot;&#x27;. The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy exercised congressional oversight over the AEC and had considerable power in influencing AEC decisions and policy.

The AEC&#x27;s far-reaching powers and control over a subject matter which had far-reaching social, public health, and military implications made it an extremely controversial organization. One of the drafters of the McMahon Act, James R. Newman, famously concluded that the bill made &quot;the field of atomic energy [an] island of socialism in the midst of a free-enterprise economy&quot;.

Before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was created, nuclear regulation was the responsibility of the AEC, which Congress first established in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. Eight years later, Congress replaced that law with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which for the first time made the development of commercial nuclear power possible, and resolved a number of other outstanding problems in implementing the first Atomic Energy Act. The act assigned the AEC the functions of both encouraging the use of nuclear power and regulating its safety. The AEC&#x27;s regulatory programs sought to ensure public health and safety from the hazards of nuclear power without imposing excessive requirements that would inhibit the growth of the industry. This was a difficult goal to achieve, especially in a new industry, and within a short time the AEC&#x27;s programs stirred considerable controversy. Stephanie Cooke has written that:

the AEC had become an oligarchy controlling all facets of the military and civilian sides of nuclear energy, promoting them and at the same time attempting to regulate them, and it had fallen down on the regulatory side ... a growing legion of critics saw too many inbuilt conflicts of interest.

The AEC had a history of involvement in experiments involving radioactive iodine. In a 1949 operation called the &quot;Green Run&quot;, the AEC released iodine-131 and xenon-133 to the atmosphere which contaminated a area containing three small towns near the Hanford site in Washington. In 1953, the AEC ran several studies on the health effects of radioactive iodine in newborns and pregnant women at the University of Iowa. Also in 1953, the AEC sponsored a study to discover if radioactive iodine affected premature babies differently from full-term babies. In the experiment, researchers from Harper Hospital in Detroit orally administered iodine-131 to 65 premature and full-term infants who weighed from . In another AEC study, researchers at the University of Nebraska College of Medicine fed iodine-131 to 28 healthy infants through a gastric tube to test the concentration of iodine in the infants&#x27; thyroid glands.

===Public opinion and abolition of the AEC===
During the 1960s and early 1970s, the Atomic Energy Commission came under fire from opposition concerned with more fundamental ecological problems such as the pollution of air and water. Under the Nixon Administration, environmental consciousness grew exponentially and the first Earth Day was held on April 22, 1970. Along with rising environmental awareness came a growing suspicion of the AEC and public hostility for their projects increased. In the public eye, there was a strong association between nuclear power and nuclear weapons, and even though the AEC had made a push in the late 1960s, to portray their efforts as being geared toward peaceful uses of atomic energy, criticism of the agency grew. The AEC was chiefly held responsible for the health problems of people living near atmospheric test sites from the early 1960s, and there was a strong association of nuclear energy with the radioactive fallout from these tests. Around the same time, the AEC was also struggling with opposition to nuclear power plant siting as well as nuclear testing. An organized push was finally made to curb the power held by the AEC, and in 1970 the AEC was forced to prepare an Environmental impact statement (EIS) for a nuclear test in northwestern Colorado as part of the initial preparation for Project Rio Blanco.

In 1973, the AEC predicted that, by the turn of the century, one thousand reactors would be needed producing electricity for homes and businesses across the United States. However, after 1973, orders for nuclear reactors declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose. Some partially completed nuclear power plants in the U.S. were stricken, and many planned nuclear plants were canceled.

By 1974, the AEC&#x27;s regulatory programs had come under such strong attack that Congress decided to abolish the agency. Supporters and critics of nuclear power agreed that the promotional and regulatory duties of the AEC should be assigned to different agencies. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 transferred the regulatory functions of the AEC to the new Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which began operations on January 19, 1975. Promotional functions went to the Energy Research and Development Administration which was later incorporated into the United States Department of Energy.

Lasting through the mid-1970s, the AEC, along with other entities including the Department of Defense, National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Society, the Manhattan Project, and various universities funded or conducted human radiation experiments. The government covered up most of these radiation mishaps until 1993, when President Bill Clinton ordered a change of policy. Nuclear radiation was known to be dangerous and deadly (from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945), and the experiments were designed to ascertain the detailed effect of radiation on human health. In Oregon, 67 prisoners with inadequate consent to vasectomies had their testicles exposed to irradiation. In Chicago, 102 volunteers with unclear consent received injections of strontium and cesium solutions to simulate radioactive fallout.

==Relationship with science==

===Ecology===
For many years, the AEC provided the most conspicuous example of the benefit of atomic age technologies to biology and medicine.
Shortly after the Atomic Energy Commission was established, its Division of Biology and Medicine began supporting diverse programs of research in the life sciences, mainly the fields of genetics, physiology, and ecology. Specifically concerning the AEC&#x27;s relationship with the field of ecology, one of the first approved funding grants went to Eugene Odum in 1951. This grant sought to observe and document the effects of radiation emission on the environment from a recently built nuclear facility on the Savannah River in South Carolina. Odum, a professor at the University of Georgia, initially submitted a proposal requesting annual funding of $267,000, but the AEC rejected the proposal and instead offered to fund a $10,000 project to observe local animal populations and the effects of secondary succession on abandoned farmland around the nuclear plant.

In 1961, AEC chairman Glenn T. Seaborg established the Technical Analysis Branch (to be directed by Hal Hollister) to study the long-term biological and ecological effects of nuclear war. Throughout the early 1960s, this group of scientists conducted several studies to determine nuclear weapons&#x27; ecological consequences and their implications for human life. As a result, during the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. government placed emphasis on the development and potential use of &quot;clean&quot; nuclear weapons to mitigate these effects.

In later years, the AEC began providing increased research opportunities to scientists by approving funding for ecological studies at various nuclear testing sites, most notably at Eniwetok, which was part of the Marshall Islands. Through their support of nuclear testing, the AEC gave ecologists a unique opportunity to study the effects of radiation on whole populations and entire ecological systems in the field. Prior to 1954, no one had investigated a complete ecosystem with the intent to measure its overall metabolism, but the AEC provided the means as well as the funding to do so. Ecological development was further spurred by environmental concerns about radioactive waste from nuclear energy and postwar atomic weapons production. In the 1950s, such concerns led the AEC to build a large ecology research group at their Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which was instrumental in the development of radioecology. A wide variety of research efforts in biology and medicine took place under the umbrella of the AEC at national laboratories and at some universities with agency sponsorship and funding. As a result of increased funding as well as the increased opportunities given to scientists and the field of ecology in general, a plethora of new techniques were developed which led to rapid growth and expansion of the field as a whole. One of these techniques afforded to ecologists involved the use of radiation, namely in ecological dating and to study the effects of stresses on the environment.

In 1969, the AEC&#x27;s relationship with science and the environment was brought to the forefront of a growing public controversy that had been building since 1965. In search for an ideal location for a large-yield nuclear test, the AEC settled upon the island of Amchitka, part of the Aleutian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The main public concern was about their location choice, as there was a large colony of endangered sea otters in close proximity. To help defuse the issue, the AEC sought a formal agreement with the Department of the Interior and the U.S. state of Alaska to help transplant the colony of sea otters to other former habitats along the West Coast.

===Arctic ecology===
The AEC played a role in expanding the field of arctic ecology. From 1959 to 1962, the Commission&#x27;s interest in this type of research peaked. For the first time, extensive effort was placed by a national agency on funding bio-environmental research in the Arctic. Research took place at Cape Thompson on the northwest coast of Alaska, and was tied to an excavation proposal named Project Chariot. The excavation project was to involve a series of underground nuclear detonations that would create an artificial harbor, consisting of a channel and circular terminal basin, which would fill with water. This would have allowed for enhanced ecological research of the area in conjunction with any nuclear testing that might occur, as it essentially would have created a controlled environment where levels and patterns of radioactive fallout resulting from weapons testing could be measured. The proposal never went through, but it evidenced the AEC&#x27;s interest in Arctic research and development.

The simplicity of biotic compositions and ecological processes in the arctic regions of the globe made ideal locations in which to pursue ecological research, especially since at the time there was minimal human modification of the landscape. All investigations conducted by the AEC produced new data from the Arctic, but few or none of them were supported solely on that basis. While the development of ecology and other sciences was not always the primary objective of the AEC, support was often given to research in these fields indirectly as an extension of their efforts for peaceful applications of nuclear energy.

==Reports==
The AEC issued a large number of technical reports through their technical information service and other channels. These had many numbering schemes, often associated with the lab from which the report was issued. AEC report numbers included AEC-AECU (unclassified), AEC-AECD (declassified), AEC-BNL (Brookhaven National Lab), AEC-HASL (Health and Safety Laboratory), AEC-HW (Hanford Works), AEC-IDO (Idaho Operations Office), AEC-LA (Los Alamos), AEC-MDCC (Manhattan District), AEC-TID (Technical Information Division), and others. Today, these reports can be found in library collections that received government documents, through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), and through public domain digitization projects such as the Technical Report Archive &amp; Image Library, which are available via HathiTrust.

<text>Robert Aurand Moon (April 15, 1917, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, US – April 10, 2001, Leesburg, Florida, US), sometimes called &quot;Mr. ZIP&quot;, is considered the father of the ZIP Code or Zone Improvement Plan, a mechanism to route mail in the United States.

==Biography==
The U.S. Postal Service had been providing a premium level &quot;air mail&quot; service since the introduction of regular air transportation. As air transportation reliability improved and cost per ounce of mail decreased, it began to make financial sense to transport larger quantities of mail via intercontinental airlines rather than ship, and interstate via the old airmail routes rather than via train. But this made the sorting of mail by hand the new &quot;bottleneck&quot; for mail service. Rather than leisurely hand sorting mail bound for various destinations while passenger trains traveled between town centers, there was a need for machine sorting speed that could match the increased volume traveling between communities by jet and direct trucking.

Rather than being sorted within a city, destined for another city, the structure of delivery had by necessity become sorting at regional sorting centers that were connected by various modes of transport (rail, air and road), with the regional centers responsible for routing mail and packages to each local post office in their region.

In 1944, Moon submitted his idea for the while working as a postal inspector in Philadelphia, but no action was taken. Following his third submission of the concept, in 1963 it received the approval of a top-level postal service committee which shares credit for further development of the Zoning Improvement Plan, &quot;ZIP&quot;. Mr. Moon&#x27;s system described the routing to general regions of the country using the first three digits of what would eventually become a five-digit and later a nine-digit system. The next two digits of the first five-digit numeric code would be for smaller delivery areas, and were the work of others. The first &quot;Directory of Post Offices&quot; using five-digit ZIP code numbers would be published in 1963.

The &quot;Mr. ZIP&quot; cartoon character that was seen on postal delivery vehicles across the United States was originally developed by ad man Harold Wilcox, whose father was a postman. Wilcox&#x27;s agency, Cunningham &amp; Walsh, originally displayed the image for a Chase Manhattan bank-by-mail campaign.

<doc id="51723" wikidata="Q127141" url="?curid=51723" title="Microsoft Bob">
<text>Microsoft Bob was a Microsoft software product intended to provide a more user-friendly interface for the Windows 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems, supplanting the Windows Program Manager. The program was released on March 11, 1995, and discontinued in early 1996. Microsoft Bob presented screens showing a house, with rooms that the user could visit containing familiar objects corresponding to computer applications, such as a desk with pen and paper and a checkbook. Clicking on the pen and paper would open the system&#x27;s word processor.

A cartoon dog named Rover and other cartoon characters provided guidance using speech balloons.

Upon release, Microsoft Bob was criticized in the media and did not gain wide acceptance with users, which resulted in its discontinuation. Its legacy would be observed in future Microsoft products, notably the use of virtual assistants. The Rover character later reappeared as a Windows XP search companion.

==History==
Microsoft Bob was released in March 1995 (before Windows 95 was released), although it had been widely publicized under the codename Utopia. The project leader for Bob was Karen Fries, a Microsoft researcher. The design was based on research by professors Clifford Nass and Byron Reeves of Stanford University. Melinda Gates, ex-wife of Bill Gates, was the marketing manager for the product. Microsoft originally purchased the domain name bob.com from Boston-area techie Bob Antia, but later traded it to Bob Kerstein for the windows2000.com domain name.

==Applications==
Microsoft Bob includes various office-suite programs such as a finance application and a word processor. The user interface was designed to simplify the navigational experience for novice computer users.

Similar to early graphical shells like Jane, the main interface is portrayed as the inside of a house, with different rooms corresponding to common real-world room styles such as a kitchen or family room. Each room contains decorations and furniture, as well as icons that represent applications. The user may also fully customize the entire house and has full control over each room&#x27;s decoration. The user may add, remove or reposition all objects. The user can also add or remove rooms and change the destinations of each door. The program offers multiple themes for room designs and decorations, such as contemporary and postmodern.

The applications built into Microsoft Bob are represented by matching decorations. For example, clicking on a clock opens the calendar, while a pen and paper represent the word processor. The user can also add shortcuts to applications on the computer. These shortcuts display the icon inside various styles of decorations, such as boxes and picture frames.

Bob includes the ability to install new applications, but because of the failure of the product, only a single add-on application package, Microsoft Great Greetings, was released.

Released just as the Internet was beginning to become popular, Bob offered an email client with which a user could subscribe to MCI Mail, a dial-up email account. The price was $5.00 per month to send up to 15 emails. Each email was limited to 5,000 characters, and each additional email after the limit was reached was an additional 45 cents. Customers were required to call a toll-free phone number to set up the account.

Bob features &quot;Assistants&quot;, cartoon characters intended to help the user navigate the virtual house or perform tasks in the main interface or within the built-in applications.

==Gateway 2000 edition==
A special Gateway 2000-branded edition of Microsoft Bob 1.00a was bundled with the Gateway 2000 computer around 1995. This edition contains Gateway branding on the login screen along with additional rooms and backgrounds not seen in the retail version. One additional room is the attic, which contains the image of a Gateway 2000 computer box. In addition to the extra rooms, more icons appear by default in the new rooms.

==Reception and legacy==
Although a Consumer Electronics Show demonstration was met with generally positive reactions, reviewers generally derided the software, and Microsoft Bob became one of Microsoft&#x27;s more visible product failures. &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the characters irritating and the home design apparently the work of an &quot;esthetically challenged sixth-grader,&quot; criticized the hardware requirements and storage file formats and concluded that the program was not as simple to use as Microsoft had advertised. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the home environment &quot;sterile&quot; and &quot;lifeless,&quot; wrote that the characters&#x27; cuteness wore thin quickly and criticized the scarce customization and access to Windows components. According to PC Data, the real sales from Bob&#x27;s release until its discontinuation amounted to only about 58,000 copies—far short of Microsoft&#x27;s estimate that it would sell millions as had Microsoft Works and &quot;Encarta&quot;. Despite being discontinued just one year after launch, Microsoft Bob continued to be sharply criticized in reviews and popular media. In 2017, Melinda Gates acknowledged that the software &quot;needed a more powerful computer than most people had back then.&quot;

Microsoft Bob was listed seventh in &quot;PC World&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 25 worst tech products of all time and as the number-one worst product of the decade by CNET.com. It was also listed among the 50 worst inventions in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which called Bob &quot;overly cutesy&quot; and an &quot;operating system designed around Clippy.&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s Steve Ballmer mentioned Bob as an example in which &quot;we decided that we have not succeeded and let&#x27;s stop [now].&quot;

Microsoft employee Raymond Chen disclosed that an encrypted copy of Bob was included on Windows XP installation CDs in order to consume space to prevent piracy. It was thought that by consuming an additional 30 megabytes on the disc (in the era of dial-up internet access), users with 56 kbit/s modems would be dissuaded from attempting to download the software illegally. Retired Microsoft engineer David Plummer has identified himself as the employee responsible for the encrypted copy. The installer routine would check for the &quot;blob of Bob&quot; and if an &quot;OEM blob&quot; was detected, only an OEM product key would be accepted. Tech journalist Harry McCracken called the story &quot;a delightfully urban legend-y tale&quot; and noted its similarities to an April Fools&#x27; Day joke claiming that Bob was hidden in Windows Vista.

The use of virtual assistants in Microsoft Bob later inspired Clippit, nicknamed &quot;Clippy&quot; (by the uninitiated) the paperclip, the default Office Assistant in Microsoft Office. Rover, the dog mascot character introduced with Bob, became a &quot;search companion&quot; for Windows XP&#x27;s file-search function.

Microsoft graphic designer Vincent Connare designed the typeface Comic Sans when he noticed that Rover&#x27;s speech was displayed in Times New Roman, which he felt was inappropriate for a cartoon dog. Although Connare&#x27;s font did not appear in the final release of Microsoft Bob because its characters did not fit within any of the typographical grids, it later debuted in Microsoft&#x27;s 3D Movie Maker and became an additional typeface for Windows 95.

<text>Melinda French Gates (born Melinda Ann French; August 15, 1964) is an American philanthropist and a former multimedia product developer and manager at Microsoft. Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, she graduated from Duke University and started working at Microsoft in 1987. Shortly afterwards, she began dating the company&#x27;s co-founder and then-CEO Bill Gates, whom she married in 1994. In 2000, she and Gates co-founded the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the world&#x27;s largest private charitable organization. The couple, who have three children together, divorced in 2021. In 2024, she resigned from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to pursue philanthropy independently, having received $12.5 billion for charitable work as part of her separation agreement. 

&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine has consistently ranked French Gates as one of the world&#x27;s most powerful women. She and her ex-husband have received numerous awards and honors for their charitable work, including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and the French Legion of Honour. She was recognized as one of the BBC&#x27;s 100 women of 2021.

==Early life and education==
Melinda Ann French was born on August 15, 1964, in Dallas, Texas. She is the second of four children born to Raymond Joseph French Jr., an aerospace engineer, and Elaine Agnes Amerland, a homemaker. She has an older sister and two younger brothers.

French, a Catholic, attended St. Monica Catholic School, where she was the valedictorian of her class. At age 14, French was introduced to the Apple II by her father and Mrs. Bauer, a school teacher who advocated teaching computer science at the all-girls school. It was from this experience she developed her interest in computer games and the BASIC programming language.

French graduated as valedictorian from Ursuline Academy of Dallas in 1982. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science and economics from Duke University in 1986 and an MBA from Duke&#x27;s Fuqua School of Business in 1987. At Duke, French was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, Beta Rho Chapter.

== Career ==
French Gates&#x27;s first job was tutoring children in mathematics and computer programming. After graduation, she became a marketing manager with Microsoft, being responsible for the development of multimedia products. These included Cinemania, Encarta, Publisher, Microsoft Bob, Money, Works (Macintosh) and Word. She worked on Expedia, which became one of the most popular travel booking websites. In the early 1990s, French Gates was appointed as General Manager of Information Products, a position which she held until 1996. She left Microsoft that year, reportedly, to focus on starting a family.

French Gates served as a member of Duke University&#x27;s board of trustees from 1996 to 2003. She attends the annual Bilderberg Group conference and has held a seat on the board of directors of Graham Holdings (formerly The Washington Post Company) since 2004. She was also on the board of directors at Drugstore.com but left in August 2006 to focus on philanthropic projects. Since 2000, French Gates has been in the public eye, stating &quot;As I thought about strong women of history, I realized that they stepped out in some way.&quot; This has allowed her work shaping and advancing the goals of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to be publicly recognized. By 2022, Bill and Melinda had given US$59.1 billion of their personal wealth to the foundation. In 2015, French Gates founded Pivotal Ventures as a separate, independent organization to identify and implement innovative solutions to problems affecting U.S. women and families. On May 13, 2024, French Gates resigned as co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to be effective June 7.

===Writing===
In 2019, French Gates debuted as an author with the book &quot;The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World&quot;. Former president Barack Obama starred in a comedy sketch, in order to promote it. The book highlights the failure to acknowledge women&#x27;s unpaid work, drawing on feminist economist Dame Marilyn Waring&#x27;s book &quot;If Women Counted&quot;.

==Personal life==

Melinda began dating Microsoft CEO Bill Gates in 1987, after meeting him at a trade fair in New York. In 1994, she married Gates in a private ceremony held in Lanai, Hawaii. They have three children: daughters Jennifer Gates Nassar (born 1996) and Phoebe Gates (born 2002) and son Rory Gates (born 1999). The family maintained a home in an earth-sheltered mansion overlooking Lake Washington in Medina, Washington. The family also owned an oceanfront residence in Del Mar, California.

In May 2021, Bill and Melinda Gates announced their decision to divorce, after 27 years of marriage. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Melinda Gates had been meeting with divorce lawyers since, at least, October 2019, after Bill&#x27;s business dealings with convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein, became public. Although the couple did not have a prenuptial agreement, Melinda Gates (who filed) did not request spousal support. She was allocated over $2 billion worth of shares and stocks from the divorce, although the full details of the financial settlement have not been disclosed. The divorce was finalized on August 2, 2021. She has publicly used the name Melinda French Gates, since the couple separated. 

In October 2021, Melinda and Bill both attended the wedding of their eldest daughter, Jennifer, to the Olympic equestrian Nayel Nassar. In March 2022, Melinda said that she and Bill were &quot;friendly&quot; but not &quot;friends.” In November 2022, she was reported to be dating former Fox News correspondent Jon Du Pre. In April 2024, a spokesperson quashed rumors that French Gates and Du Pre had become engaged, confirming that the two were no longer dating. French Gates became a grandmother, for the first time, in March 2023, when Jennifer gave birth to a daughter.

After the divorce, the now independently wealthy French Gates has become a prominent megadonor to the Democratic Party, with a focus on abortion rights. She donated over $10 million to Democratic causes, in the time leading up to the 2024 US presidential election. In that election, she endorsed Joe Biden and then, after he stepped aside, Kamala Harris, her first presidential endorsements.

French Gates is a practicing Catholic.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1998, Melinda and Bill Gates were each honored with an American Library Association Honorary Membership. In 2002, Melinda and Bill Gates received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out, annually, by Jefferson Awards. In December 2005, Melinda and Bill were named, by &quot;Time,&quot; as Persons of the Year, alongside Bono. Melinda and Bill Gates received the Spanish Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation on May 4, 2006, in recognition of their world impact through charitable giving. In November 2006, French Gates was awarded the Insignia of the Order of the Aztec Eagle, together, with Bill, who was awarded the Placard of the same order, both for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program &quot;Un país de lectores&quot;.

In May 2006, in honor of her work to improve the lives of children locally and around the world, Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital dedicated the Melinda French Gates Ambulatory Care building at Seattle Children&#x27;s (formerly Children&#x27;s Hospital and Regional Medical Center). She chaired a campaign for the hospital to fundraise $300 million to expand facilities, fund under-compensated and uncompensated care, and grow the hospital&#x27;s research program to find cures and treatments.

In 2007, French Gates received an honorary doctorate in medicine from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2009, she and her then-husband received honorary degrees from the University of Cambridge. Their benefaction of $210 million in 2000 set up the Gates Cambridge Trust, which funds postgraduate scholars from outside the UK to study at the university. Lastly, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by Duke University, in 2013, in honor of her philanthropic commitment.

She has been repeatedly recognized, by Forbes in its annual list of the 100 Most Powerful Women, ranking #3 in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2017, #4 in 2012 and 2016, #5 in 2020 and 2021, and #6 in 2011, 2018, 2019 and 2022, #10 in 2023. She was awarded the UCSF medal in 2013. French Gates was appointed an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 2013, for services to philanthropy and international development. In recognition of the foundation&#x27;s philanthropic activities in India, Bill and Melinda, jointly, received India&#x27;s third-highest civilian honor, Padma Bhushan, in 2015. In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded French Gates and her husband with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, for their philanthropic efforts.

In 2017, President François Hollande awarded France&#x27;s highest national honor to French Gates and her husband, for their charitable efforts, i.e. as Commander of the Legion of Honour. That year, she was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal 2016 of the United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN), Berlin-Brandenburg, &quot;for outstanding services to peace and international understanding&quot; in the historic Berlin Town Hall. That year, French Gates was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 12 in the list of 200 Most Influential Philanthropists and Social Entrepreneurs Worldwide. In June 2024, she delivered the Commencement address at Stanford University.

==Women in technology==
French Gates&#x27;s experience of a male-dominated workplace at Microsoft inspired her to encourage more women in the computing field. In September 2016, she announced her desire to increase diversity in the workplace, especially in the technology industry, stating: &quot;Every company needs technology, and yet we&#x27;re graduating fewer women technologists. That is not good for society. We have to change it.&quot; French Gates also spoke about this topic at the 2017 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, an annual series of conferences. She was recognized as one of the BBC&#x27;s 100 women of 2021.

<doc id="51727" wikidata="Q201783" url="?curid=51727" title="Moped">
<text>A moped () is a type of small motorcycle, generally having a less stringent licensing requirement than full motorcycles or automobiles. Historically, the term exclusively meant a similar vehicle with both bicycle pedals and a motorcycle engine. Mopeds typically travel only slightly faster than bicycles on public roads.

Traditional mopeds are distinguishable by their pedals, similar to a bicycle. Some mopeds have a step-through frame design, while others have motorcycle frame designs, including a backbone and a raised fuel tank, mounted directly between the saddle and the head tube. Some resemble motorized bicycles, similar to modern ebikes. Most are similar to a regular motorcycle but with pedals and a crankset that may be used with or instead of motor drive. Although mopeds usually have two wheels, some jurisdictions classify low-powered three- or four-wheeled vehicles (including ATVs and go-kart) as a moped.

In some countries, a moped can be any motorcycle with an engine capacity below (most commonly or lower).

==Etymology==

The word &quot;moped&quot; was coined by the Swedish journalist Harald Nielsen in 1952, as a portmanteau of the Swedish words and . The claimed derivation from the term &quot;motor-velocipede&quot; is incorrect. According to Douglas Harper, the Swedish terms originated from &quot;(&quot;trampcykel med&quot;) mo(tor och&quot;) ped(aler&quot;)&quot;, which means &quot;pedal cycle with engine and pedals&quot; (the earliest versions had auxiliary pedals). Like some of the earliest two wheeled motorcycles, all mopeds were once equipped with bicycle pedals.

==History==

The term &quot;moped&quot; now only applies to low-power (often super-economy) vehicles, but pedals were fitted to some early motorcycles, such as the pictured 1912 Douglas. Pedaling away from stationary was a great improvement over &quot;run and jump&quot; and light pedal assistance (LPA) was valuable for climbing hills. Better transmissions with wider ranges, better clutches and much better engine performance made pedals obsolete on most motorcycles by 1918 but the pedals on mopeds remained valuable for their original purposes as late as the 1990s.

The earliest mopeds were bicycles with a helper motor in various locations, for example on top of the front wheel; they were also called cyclemotors. An example of that type is the VéloSoleX brand, which simply has a roller driving the front tire.

A more innovative design was known in the UK as the Cyclemaster. This had a complete powered rear wheel which was simply substituted for the bicycle rear wheel, which originated from a design by two DKW engineers in Germany. Slightly larger machines, commonly with a engine were known as autocycles. On the other hand, some mopeds, such as the Czech-made Jawa, were derived from motorcycles.

A further category of low-powered two-wheelers exists today in some jurisdictions for bicycles with helper motors – these are often defined as power-assisted bicycles or motorized bicycles. Other jurisdictions may categorize the same machines as mopeds, creating a certain amount of confusion. In many countries three-wheelers and microcars are classified as mopeds or variations thereof. This practice is not restricted to the third world; France and Belgium classify microcars such as the Aixam similarly or as &quot;light quadricycles&quot;. The Ariel 3, a motorised three-wheeler is classed as a moped.

As of 1977, the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic considers the moped any two-wheeled or three-wheeled vehicle which is fitted with an internal combustion engine having a cylinder capacity not exceeding 50 cc.
==Emissions==

Mopeds can achieve fuel economy of over . The emissions of mopeds have been the subject of multiple studies. Studies have found that two-stroke 50 cc mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emit ten to thirty times the hydrocarbons and particulate emissions of the outdated Euro 3 automobile standards. In the same study, four-stroke mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emitted three to eight times the hydrocarbons and particulate emissions of the Euro 3 automobile standards. Approximate parity with automobiles was achieved with NOx emissions in these studies. Emissions performance was tested on a g/km basis and was unaffected by fuel economy. Currently in the United States, the EPA allows motorcycles, scooters, and mopeds with engine displacements less than to emit ten times the NOx and six times the CO as the median Tier II bin 5 automobile regulations. An additional air quality problem can also arise from the use of moped and scooter transportation over automobiles, as a higher density of motorized vehicles can be supported by existing transportation infrastructure.

==Safety==

Safely riding a moped mostly requires the same considerations as safely riding a motorcycle. However the lower speeds reduce some dangers and increase others. The biggest danger is that other traffic may not notice the presence of a moped; bright clothes and reflective fittings help. Drivers may even see the moped, recognize it as harmless to them and simply forget it is there, pulling out of side-turnings into its path. Similarly, a car approaching a moped from behind will approach it more quickly than the driver expects, and the driver&#x27;s attention may be more attuned to other automobile traffic rather than the moped, increasing the likelihood of an accident. This is a particular problem for mopeds used on high-speed roads where they may not be intended to travel.

Mopeds are often tuned for higher speeds, powers or engine displacements. For this to be legally allowed in most jurisdictions, such vehicles should be re-registered as motorcycles, and their driver&#x27;s license requirements, taxes, insurance costs, and minimum driver age may be higher. A tuned vehicle, not designed for higher speeds, is not as safe as a purpose-designed motorcycle. A survey of Finnish high school vocational and gymnasium students found that 80% and 70% of their respective mopeds were tuned. Only 10% of trade school students had a moped that conformed to legislation. The average maximum speed was 72 km/h (45 mph), far higher than the legally allowable 45 km/h (28 mph). Another study reported that of school-age moped owners, 50% of boys and 15% of girls have an illegally tuned moped.

==Sports moped==

In the United Kingdom during the 1970s, a high-performance derivation of the moped concept was developed, aimed at 16-year-olds. It was created in order to circumvent governmental legislation aimed at forcing young motorcycle riders off the road. These new laws, called the &quot;Sixteener Law&quot;, were introduced by John Peyton, the then Conservative Party Minister for Transport in 1971. They forbade 16-year-olds from riding motorcycles of up to capacity as they had done before, and limited them to machines until they were 17. The law provoked motorcycle manufacturers to develop new class of motorcycle which were then called &quot;sports mopeds&quot; or, colloquially, &quot;sixteener specials&quot; and was subject to much criticism. The market for these was primarily young males.

Sports mopeds were ostensibly motorcycles, capable of doing more than in some cases, with bicycle-style pedals added to them which the law required were capable of propelling the vehicle. Models were produced by Japanese manufacturers Honda, Yamaha and Suzuki, and European companies such as Puch, Fantic, Gilera, Gitane and Garelli from 1972 onwards, the most famous of which was the Yamaha FS1-E. They included roadsters, enduro and motocrossers, cafe racers and choppers or scooters, and led to a boom interest in motorcycling similar to the early 1960 rocker period. The government responded again by bringing in even more restrictive legislation in 1977 which limited mopeds to a weight of and a top speed to . The move contributed to the decline of the UK motorcycle market. In Continental Europe no such restrictions existed and such vehicles could be ridden by 14-year-olds.

<text>In mathematical analysis, Lipschitz continuity, named after German mathematician Rudolf Lipschitz, is a strong form of uniform continuity for functions. Intuitively, a Lipschitz continuous function is limited in how fast it can change: there exists a real number such that, for every pair of points on the graph of this function, the absolute value of the slope of the line connecting them is not greater than this real number; the smallest such bound is called the &quot;Lipschitz constant&quot; of the function (and is related to the &quot;modulus of uniform continuity&quot;). For instance, every function that is defined on an interval and has a bounded first derivative is Lipschitz continuous.

In the theory of differential equations, Lipschitz continuity is the central condition of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the solution to an initial value problem. A special type of Lipschitz continuity, called contraction, is used in the Banach fixed-point theorem.

We have the following chain of strict inclusions for functions over a closed and bounded non-trivial interval of the real line:

: [[Continuously differentiable]] ⊂ Lipschitz continuous ⊂ formula_1-[[Hölder continuous]],

where formula_2. We also have

: Lipschitz continuous ⊂ [[absolutely continuous]] ⊂ [[uniformly continuous]].

== Definitions ==
Given two metric spaces (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;X&quot;) and (&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;d&quot;&quot;Y&quot;), where &quot;d&quot;&quot;X&quot; denotes the metric on the set &quot;X&quot; and &quot;d&quot;&quot;Y&quot; is the metric on set &quot;Y&quot;, a function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is called Lipschitz continuous if there exists a real constant &quot;K&quot; ≥ 0 such that, for all &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2 in &quot;X&quot;,
:formula_3
Any such &quot;K&quot; is referred to as a Lipschitz constant for the function &quot;f&quot; and &quot;f&quot; may also be referred to as K-Lipschitz. The smallest constant is sometimes called the (best) Lipschitz constant of &quot;f&quot; or the dilation or dilatation of &quot;f&quot;. If &quot;K&quot; = 1 the function is called a short map, and if 0 ≤ &quot;K&quot; &lt; 1 and &quot;f&quot; maps a metric space to itself, the function is called a contraction.

In particular, a real-valued function &quot;f&quot; : R → R is called Lipschitz continuous if there exists a positive real constant K such that, for all real &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2,
:formula_4
In this case, &quot;Y&quot; is the set of real numbers R with the standard metric &quot;d&quot;&quot;Y&quot;(&quot;y1&quot;, &quot;y2&quot;) = |&quot;y1&quot; − &quot;y2&quot;|, and &quot;X&quot; is a subset of R.

In general, the inequality is (trivially) satisfied if &quot;x&quot;1 = &quot;x&quot;2. Otherwise, one can equivalently define a function to be Lipschitz continuous if and only if there exists a constant &quot;K&quot; ≥ 0 such that, for all &quot;x&quot;1 ≠ &quot;x&quot;2, 
:formula_5
For real-valued functions of several real variables, this holds if and only if the absolute value of the slopes of all secant lines are bounded by &quot;K&quot;. The set of lines of slope &quot;K&quot; passing through a point on the graph of the function forms a circular cone, and a function is Lipschitz if and only if the graph of the function everywhere lies completely outside of this cone (see figure).

A function is called locally Lipschitz continuous if for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; there exists a neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;f&quot; restricted to &quot;U&quot; is Lipschitz continuous. Equivalently, if &quot;X&quot; is a locally compact metric space, then &quot;f&quot; is locally Lipschitz if and only if it is Lipschitz continuous on every compact subset of &quot;X&quot;. In spaces that are not locally compact, this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.

More generally, a function &quot;f&quot; defined on &quot;X&quot; is said to be Hölder continuous or to satisfy a Hölder condition of order α &gt; 0 on &quot;X&quot; if there exists a constant &quot;M&quot; ≥ 0 such that
:formula_6 
for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. Sometimes a Hölder condition of order α is also called a uniform Lipschitz condition of order α &gt; 0.

For a real number &quot;K&quot; ≥ 1, if
:formula_7
then &quot;f&quot; is called K&quot;-bilipschitz (also written K&quot;-bi-Lipschitz). We say &quot;f&quot; is bilipschitz or bi-Lipschitz to mean there exists such a &quot;K&quot;. A bilipschitz mapping is injective, and is in fact a homeomorphism onto its image. A bilipschitz function is the same thing as an injective Lipschitz function whose inverse function is also Lipschitz.

==Examples==
;Lipschitz continuous functions that are everywhere differentiable:
;Lipschitz continuous functions that are not everywhere differentiable:
;Lipschitz continuous functions that are everywhere differentiable but not continuously differentiable:
;Continuous functions that are not (globally) Lipschitz continuous:
;Differentiable functions that are not (locally) Lipschitz continuous:
;Analytic functions that are not (globally) Lipschitz continuous:

==Properties==
*An everywhere differentiable function &quot;g&quot; : R → R is Lipschitz continuous (with &quot;K&quot; = sup |&quot;g&quot;′(&quot;x&quot;)|) if and only if it has a bounded first derivative; one direction follows from the mean value theorem. In particular, any continuously differentiable function is locally Lipschitz, as continuous functions are locally bounded so its gradient is locally bounded as well.
*A Lipschitz function &quot;g&quot; : R → R is absolutely continuous and therefore is differentiable almost everywhere, that is, differentiable at every point outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero. Its derivative is essentially bounded in magnitude by the Lipschitz constant, and for &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;, the difference &quot;g&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) − &quot;g&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is equal to the integral of the derivative &quot;g&quot;′ on the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;].
**Conversely, if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;I&quot; → R is absolutely continuous and thus differentiable almost everywhere, and satisfies |&quot;f′&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)| ≤ &quot;K&quot; for almost all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant at most &quot;K&quot;.
**More generally, Rademacher&#x27;s theorem extends the differentiability result to Lipschitz mappings between Euclidean spaces: a Lipschitz map &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → R&quot;m&quot;, where &quot;U&quot; is an open set in R&quot;n&quot;, is almost everywhere differentiable. Moreover, if &quot;K&quot; is the best Lipschitz constant of &quot;f&quot;, then formula_8 whenever the total derivative &quot;Df&quot; exists.
*For a differentiable Lipschitz map formula_9 the inequality formula_10 holds for the best Lipschitz constant formula_11 of formula_12. If the domain formula_13 is convex then in fact formula_14.
*Suppose that {&quot;fn&quot;} is a sequence of Lipschitz continuous mappings between two metric spaces, and that all &quot;fn&quot; have Lipschitz constant bounded by some &quot;K&quot;. If &quot;fn&quot; converges to a mapping &quot;f&quot; uniformly, then &quot;f&quot; is also Lipschitz, with Lipschitz constant bounded by the same &quot;K&quot;. In particular, this implies that the set of real-valued functions on a compact metric space with a particular bound for the Lipschitz constant is a closed and convex subset of the Banach space of continuous functions. This result does not hold for sequences in which the functions may have &quot;unbounded&quot; Lipschitz constants, however. In fact, the space of all Lipschitz functions on a compact metric space is a subalgebra of the Banach space of continuous functions, and thus dense in it, an elementary consequence of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem (or as a consequence of Weierstrass approximation theorem, because every polynomial is locally Lipschitz continuous).
*Every Lipschitz continuous map is uniformly continuous, and hence continuous. More generally, a set of functions with bounded Lipschitz constant forms an equicontinuous set. The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem implies that if {&quot;fn&quot;} is a uniformly bounded sequence of functions with bounded Lipschitz constant, then it has a convergent subsequence. By the result of the previous paragraph, the limit function is also Lipschitz, with the same bound for the Lipschitz constant. In particular the set of all real-valued Lipschitz functions on a compact metric space &quot;X&quot; having Lipschitz constant ≤ &quot;K&quot;  is a locally compact convex subset of the Banach space &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).
*For a family of Lipschitz continuous functions &quot;f&quot;α with common constant, the function formula_15 (and formula_16) is Lipschitz continuous as well, with the same Lipschitz constant, provided it assumes a finite value at least at a point. 
*If &quot;U&quot; is a subset of the metric space &quot;M&quot; and &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → R is a Lipschitz continuous function, there always exist Lipschitz continuous maps &quot;M&quot; → R that extend &quot;f&quot; and have the same Lipschitz constant as &quot;f&quot; (see also Kirszbraun theorem). An extension is provided by 
::formula_17 
:where &quot;k&quot; is a Lipschitz constant for &quot;f&quot; on &quot;U&quot;.

==Lipschitz manifolds==
A Lipschitz structure on a topological manifold is defined using an atlas of charts whose transition maps are bilipschitz; this is possible because bilipschitz maps form a pseudogroup. Such a structure allows one to define locally Lipschitz maps between such manifolds, similarly to how one defines smooth maps between smooth manifolds: if and are Lipschitz manifolds, then a function formula_18 is locally Lipschitz if and only if for every pair of coordinate charts formula_19 and formula_20, where and are open sets in the corresponding Euclidean spaces, the composition
formula_21
is locally Lipschitz. This definition does not rely on defining a metric on or .

This structure is intermediate between that of a piecewise-linear manifold and a topological manifold: a PL structure gives rise to a unique Lipschitz structure. While Lipschitz manifolds are closely related to topological manifolds, Rademacher&#x27;s theorem allows one to do analysis, yielding various applications.

==One-sided Lipschitz==
Let &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) be an upper semi-continuous function of &quot;x&quot;, and that &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a closed, convex set for all &quot;x&quot;. Then &quot;F&quot; is one-sided Lipschitz if
:formula_22 
for some &quot;C&quot; and for all &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2.

It is possible that the function &quot;F&quot; could have a very large Lipschitz constant but a moderately sized, or even negative, one-sided Lipschitz constant. For example, the function

:formula_23

has Lipschitz constant &quot;K&quot; = 50 and a one-sided Lipschitz constant &quot;C&quot; = 0. An example which is one-sided Lipschitz but not Lipschitz continuous is &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;e&quot;−&quot;x&quot;, with &quot;C&quot; = 0.

<text>A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to a belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with a closed loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward. The powered pulley is called the drive pulley, while the unpowered pulley is called the idler pulley. There are two main industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, coal, ore, sand, overburden and more.

== Overview ==

Conveyors are durable and reliable components used in automated distribution and warehousing, as well as manufacturing and production facilities. In combination with computer-controlled pallet handling equipment this allows for more efficient retail, wholesale, and manufacturing distribution. It is considered a labor-saving system that allows large volumes to move rapidly through a process, allowing companies to ship or receive higher volumes with smaller storage space and with labor expense.

Belt conveyors are the most commonly used powered conveyors because they are the most versatile and the least expensive. Products are conveyed directly on the belt so both regular and irregular shaped objects, large or small, light and heavy, can be transported successfully. Belt conveyors are also manufactured with curved sections that use tapered rollers and curved belting to convey products around a corner. These conveyor systems are commonly used in postal sorting offices and airport baggage handling systems.

Belt conveyors are generally fairly similar in construction consisting of a metal frame with rollers at either end of a flat metal bed. Rubber conveyor belts are commonly used to convey items with irregular bottom surfaces, small items that would fall in between rollers (e.g. a sushi conveyor bar), or bags of product that would sag between rollers. The belt is looped around each of the rollers and when one of the rollers is powered (by an electrical motor) the belting slides across the solid metal frame bed, moving the product. In heavy use applications, the beds in which the belting is pulled over are replaced with rollers. The rollers allow weight to be conveyed as they reduce the amount of friction generated from the heavier loading on the belting. The exception to the standard belt conveyor construction is the sandwich belt conveyor. The sandwich belt conveyor uses two conveyor belts, instead of one. These two conventional conveyor belts are positioned face to face, to firmly contain the items being carried in a &quot;sandwich-like&quot; hold.

Belt conveyors can be used to transport products in a straight line or through changes in elevation or direction. For conveying bulk materials, over gentle slopes or gentle curvatures, a troughed belt conveyor is used. The trough of the belt ensures that the flowable material is contained within the edges of the belt. The trough is achieved by keeping the idler rollers in an angle to the horizontal at the sides of the idler frame. A pipe conveyor is used for material travel paths that require sharper bends and inclines up to 35 degrees. A pipe conveyor features the edges of the belt being rolled together to form a circular section like a pipe. Like a troughed belt conveyor, a pipe conveyor also uses idler rollers. However, in this case, the idler frame completely surrounds the conveyor belt helping it to retain the pipe section while pushing it forward. In the case of travel paths requiring high angles and snake-like curvatures, a sandwich belt is used. The sandwich belt design enables materials carried to travel along a path of high inclines up to 90-degree angles, enabling a vertical path as opposed to a horizontal one. This transport option is also powered by idlers.

Other important components of the belt conveying system apart from the pulleys and idler rollers include the drive arrangement of reducer gear boxes, drive motors, and associated couplings. scrapers to clean the belt, chutes for controlling the discharge direction, skirts for containing the discharge on the receiving belt, take up assembly for &quot;tensioning&quot; the belt, safety switches for personnel safety and technological structures like stringer, short post, drive frames, pulley frames make up the balance items to complete the belt conveying system. In certain applications, belt conveyors can also be used for static accumulation or cartons.

== History ==
Primitive conveyor belts have been in use since the 19th century. In 1868, an English shipwright Joseph Thomas Parlour from Pimlico patented a grain elevator with a conveyor belt while Illinoisan Charles Denton of Ames Plow Co. patented a reaper with a belt &quot;conveyer&quot;. By the 1880s conveyor belts were used in American elevators, sugarcane mills and sawmills, as well as British maltings.

In 1892, Thomas Robins began a series of inventions which led to the development of a conveyor belt used for carrying coal, ores and other products. In 1901, Sandvik invented and started the production of steel conveyor belts. In 1905, Richard Sutcliffe invented the first conveyor belts for use in coal mines which revolutionized the mining industry. In 1913, Henry Ford introduced conveyor-belt assembly lines at Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Highland Park, Michigan factory.

In 1972, the French society REI created in New Caledonia the longest straight-belt conveyor in the world in that moment, at a length of . Hyacynthe Marcel Bocchetti was the concept designer.. The longest conveyor belt is that of the Bou Craa phosphate mine in Western Sahara (1973, 98 km in 11 sections). The longest single-span conveyor belt is at the Boddington bauxite mine in Western Australia (31 km).

In 1957, the B. F. Goodrich Company patented a Möbius strip conveyor belt, that it went on to produce as the &quot;Turnover Conveyor Belt System&quot;. Incorporating a half-twist, it had the advantage over conventional belts of a longer life because it could expose all of its surface area to wear and tear. Such Möbius strip belts are no longer manufactured because untwisted modern belts can be made more durable by constructing them from several layers of different materials. In 1970, Intralox, a Louisiana-based company, registered the first patent for all plastic, modular belting.

== Structure ==
The belt consists of one or more layers of material. It is common for belts to have three layers: a top cover, a carcass and a bottom cover. The purpose of the carcass is to provide linear strength and shape. The carcass is often a woven or metal fabric having a warp &amp; weft. The warp refers to longitudinal cords whose characteristics of resistance and elasticity define the running properties of the belt. The weft represents the whole set of transversal cables allowing to the belt specific resistance against cuts, tears and impacts and at the same time high flexibility. The most common carcass materials are steel, polyester, nylon, cotton and aramid (class of heat-resistant and strong synthetic fibers, with Twaron or Kevlar as brand names). The covers are usually various rubber or plastic compounds specified by use of the belt.

Steel conveyor belts are used when high strength class is required. For example, the highest strength class conveyor belt installed is made of steel cords. This conveyor belt has a strength class of and it operates at Chuquicamata mine, in Chile. Polyester, nylon and cotton are popular with low strength classes. Aramid is used in the range . The advantages of using aramid are energy savings, enhanced lifetimes and improved productivity. As an example, a , underground belt installed at Baodian Coal Mine, part of in Yanzhou Coal Mining Company, China, was reported to provide energy savings of over 15%. Whilst Shenhua Group, has installed several aramid conveyor belts, including a belt with a length of .

== Applications ==
Today there are different types of conveyor belts that have been created for conveying different kinds of material available in PVC and rubber materials. 
Material flowing over the belt may be weighed in transit using a beltweigher. Belts with regularly spaced partitions, known as &quot;elevator belts&quot;, are used for transporting loose materials up steep inclines. Belt Conveyors are used in self-unloading bulk freighters and in live bottom trucks. Belt conveyor technology is also used in conveyor transport such as moving sidewalks or escalators, as well as on many manufacturing assembly lines. Stores often have conveyor belts at the check-out counter to move shopping items, and may use checkout dividers in this process. Ski areas also use conveyor belts to transport skiers up the hill. Industrial and manufacturing applications for belt conveyors include package handling, trough belt conveyors, trash handling, bag handling, coding conveyors, and more. Integration of Human-Machine Interface(HMI) to operate the conveyor system is in the developing stages and will prove to be an efficient innovation.

=== Long belt conveyors ===

The longest belt conveyor system in the world is in Western Sahara. It was built in 1972 by Friedrich Krupp GmbH (now thyssenkrupp) and is long, from the phosphate mines of Bu Craa to the coast south of El-Aaiun.

The longest conveyor system in an airport is the Dubai International Airport baggage handling system at . It was installed by Siemens and commissioned in 2008, and has a combination of traditional belt conveyors and tray conveyors.

Boddington Bauxite Mine in Western Australia is officially recognized as having the world&#x27;s longest single flight conveyor. Single flight means the load is not transferred, it is a single continuous system for the entire length. This conveyor is a cable belt conveyor system with a conveyor feeding a conveyor. Cable belt conveyors are a variation on the more conventional idler belt system. Instead of running on top of idlers, cable belt conveyors are supported by two endless steel cables (steel wire rope) which are in turn supported by idler pulley wheels. This system feeds bauxite through the difficult terrain of the Darling Ranges to the Worsley Alumina refinery.

The second longest single trough belt conveyor is the Impumelelo conveyor near Secunda, South Africa. It was designed by Conveyor Dynamics, Inc. based in Bellingham, Washington, USA and constructed by ELB Engineering based in Johannesburg South Africa. The conveyor transports coal from a mine to a refinery that converts the coal to diesel fuel. The third longest trough belt conveyor in the world is the Curragh conveyor near Westfarmers, QLD, Australia. Conveyor Dynamics, Inc. supplied the basic engineering, control system and commissioning. Detail engineering and Construction was completed by Laing O&#x27;Rourke.

The longest single-belt international conveyor runs from Meghalaya in India to a cement factory at Chhatak Bangladesh. It is about long and conveys limestone and shale at , from the quarry in India to the cement factory ( long in India and long in Bangladesh). The conveyor was engineered by AUMUND France and Larsen &amp; Toubro. The conveyor is actuated by three synchronized drive units for a total power of about 1.8 MW supplied by ABB (two drives at the head end in Bangladesh and one drive at the tail end in India). The conveyor belt was manufactured in lengths on the Indian side and lengths on the Bangladesh side. The idlers, or rollers, of the system are unique in that they are designed to accommodate both horizontal and vertical curves along the terrain. Dedicated vehicles were designed for the maintenance of the conveyor, which is always at a minimum height of above the ground to avoid being flooded during monsoon periods.

=== Belt conveyor safety system ===
Conveyors used in industrial settings include tripping mechanisms such as trip cords along the length of the conveyor. This allows for workers to immediately shut down the conveyor when a problem arises. Warning alarms are included to notify employees that a conveyor is about to turn on. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued regulations for conveyor safety, as OSHA 1926.555.

Some other systems used to safeguard the conveyor are belt sway switches, speed switches, belt rip switch, and emergency stops. The belt sway switch will stop the conveyor if the belt starts losing its alignment along the structure. The speed switch will stop the belt if the switch is not registering that the belt is running at the required speed. The belt rip switch will stop the belt when there is a cut, or a flap indicating that the belt is in danger of further damage. An emergency stop may be located on the conveyor control box in case of trip chord malfunctions.

=== Reuse ===
Worn rubber or elastomer belts can be reused in many ways. Applications for the material include toolbox liners, anti-fatigue floor mats, dock bumpers, landscale edging, livestock fencing, and water diversion.

<text>The term dark moon describes the last visible crescent of a waning Moon. The duration of a dark moon varies between 1.5 and 3.5 days, depending on its ecliptic latitude. In current astronomical usage, the new moon occurs in the middle of this dark period, when the Moon and Sun are in conjunction. This definition has entered popular usage, so that calendars will typically indicate the date of the &quot;new moon&quot; rather than the &quot;dark moon&quot;.

== Dark moon as the 30th division ==

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines the new moon as &quot;the first visible crescent of the Moon, after conjunction with the Sun&quot;. &quot;Dark moon&quot; is a term used for a waning crescent moon. When the Moon&#x27;s orbit is divided into 30 segments, as the ancient Greeks did in the time of Homer, the Babylonians did, and the Indians still do today (calling them &quot;tithi&quot;), the last phase is called the &quot;dark moon&quot;. In Greek, it was called the &quot;old moon&quot; and associated with Hecate. In India, it is called Amavasya and associated with Kali. Both of these goddesses have a dark connotation, hence the term dark moon.

In Babylonian, Greek, and Indian culture, the dark moon occurs within the 12° of angular distance between the Moon and the Sun before conjunction (a type of syzygy). The new moon occurs within the 12° after syzygy. This 12° arc is called &quot;uma&quot; by the Babylonians and &quot;tithi&quot; by the Indians.

The Moon takes a mean duration of 23 hours and 37 minutes to cover this length, but this period can vary from 21 to 26 hours because of the Moon&#x27;s orbital anomaly. This means that the &quot;dark moon&quot; actually lasts approximately 23 hours and 37 minutes and includes any time marked as &quot;new moon&quot; on a lunar calendar, and not 1.5 to 3.5 days as stated earlier.

<text>A non-rigid airship, commonly called a blimp (), is an airship (dirigible) without an internal structural framework or a keel. Unlike semi-rigid and rigid airships (e.g. Zeppelins), blimps rely on the pressure of their lifting gas (usually helium, rather than flammable hydrogen) and the strength of the envelope to maintain their shape. Blimps are known for their use in advertising, surveillance, and observation due to their maneuverability, slow speeds and steady flight capabilities.

==Principle==
Since blimps keep their shape with internal overpressure, typically the only solid parts are the passenger car (gondola) and the tail fins. A non-rigid airship that uses heated air instead of a light gas (such as helium) as a lifting medium is called a hot-air airship (sometimes there are battens near the bow, which assist with higher forces there from a mooring attachment or from the greater aerodynamic pressures there).

Volume changes of the lifting gas due to temperature changes or to changes of altitude are compensated for by pumping air into internal ballonets (air bags) to maintain the overpressure. Without sufficient overpressure, the blimp loses its ability to be steered and is slowed due to increased drag and distortion. The propeller air stream can be used to inflate the ballonets and so the hull. In some models, such as the Skyship 600, differential ballonet inflation can provide a measure of pitch trim control.

The engines driving the propellers are usually directly attached to the gondola, and in some models are partly steerable.

Blimps are the most commonly built airships because they are relatively easy to build and easy to transport once deflated. However, because of their unstable hull, their size is limited. A blimp with too long a hull may kink in the middle when the overpressure is insufficient or when maneuvered too fast (this has also happened with semi-rigid airships with weak keels). This led to the development of semi-rigids and rigid airships.

Modern blimps are launched somewhat heavier than air (overweight), in contrast to historic blimps. The missing lift is provided by lifting the nose and using engine power, or by angling the engine thrust. Some types also use steerable propellers or ducted fans. Operating in a state heavier than air avoids the need to dump ballast at lift-off and also avoids the need to lose costly helium lifting gas on landing (most of the Zeppelins achieved lift with very inexpensive hydrogen, which could be vented without concern to decrease altitude).
==Etymology==

The origin of the word &quot;blimp&quot; has been the subject of some confusion. Lennart Ege notes two possible derivations:
A 1943 etymology, published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, supports a British origin during the First World War when the British were experimenting with lighter-than-air craft. The initial non-rigid aircraft was called the A-limp; and a second version called the B-limp was deemed more satisfactory.

Yet a third derivation is given by Barnes and James in &quot;Shorts Aircraft since 1900&quot;:
Dr. A. D. Topping researched the origins of the word and concluded that the British had never had a &quot;Type B, limp&quot; designation, and that Cunningham&#x27;s coinage appeared to be the correct explanation.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; notes its use in print in 1916: &quot;Visited the Blimps ... this afternoon at Capel&quot;. In 1918, the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; said that it was &quot;an onomatopœic name invented by that genius for apposite nomenclature, the late Horace Short&quot;.

==Use==
The B-class blimps were patrol airships operated by the United States Navy during and shortly after World War I. The Navy learned a great deal from the DN-1 fiasco. The result was the very successful B-type airships. Dr. Jerome Hunsaker was asked to develop a theory of airship design. This was followed by then-Lieutenant John H. Towers, USN, returning from Europe having inspected British designs, and the U.S. Navy subsequently sought bids for 16 blimps from American manufacturers. On 4 February 1917 the Secretary of the Navy directed that 16 nonrigid airships of Class B be procured. Ultimately Goodyear built 9 envelopes, Goodrich built five and Curtiss built the gondolas for all of those 14 ships. Connecticut Aircraft contracted with U.S. Rubber for its two envelopes and with Pigeon Fraser for its gondolas. The Curtiss-built gondolas were modified JN-4 fuselages and were powered by OX-5 engines. The Connecticut Aircraft blimps were powered by Hall-Scott engines.

In 1930, a former German airship officer, Captain Anton Heinen, working in the US for the US Navy on its dirigible fleet, attempted to design and build a four-place blimp called the &quot;family air yacht&quot; for private fliers which the inventor claimed would be priced below $10,000 and easier to fly than a fixed-wing aircraft if placed in production. It was unsuccessful.

In 2021, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; said that &quot;consensus is that there are about 25 blimps still in existence and only about half of them are still in use for advertising purposes&quot;. The Airsign Airship Group is the owner and operator of 8 of these active ships, including the Hood Blimp, DirecTV blimp, and the MetLife blimp.

=== Surveillance blimp ===
This blimp is a type of airborne early warning and control aircraft, typically as the active part of a system which includes a mooring platform, communications and information processing. Example systems include the U.S. JLENS and Israeli Aeronautics Defense Skystar 300.

Surveillance blimps known as aerostats have been used extensively in the Middle East by the United States military, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.

<text>A drawing board (also drawing table, drafting table or architect&#x27;s table) is, in its antique form, a kind of multipurpose desk which can be used for any kind of drawing, writing or impromptu sketching on a large sheet of paper or for reading a large format book or other oversized document or for drafting precise technical illustrations (such as engineering drawings or architectural drawings). The drawing table used to be a frequent companion to a pedestal desk in a study or private library, during the pre-industrial and early industrial era.

During the Industrial Revolution, draftsmanship gradually became a specialized trade and drawing tables slowly moved out of the libraries and offices of most gentlemen. They became more utilitarian and were built of steel and plastic instead of fine woods and brass.

More recently, engineers and draftsmen use the drawing board for making and modifying drawings on paper with ink or pencil. Different drawing instruments (set square, protractor, etc.) are used on it to draw parallel, perpendicular or oblique lines. There are instruments for drawing circles, arcs, other curves and symbols too (compass, French curve, stencil, etc.). However, with the gradual introduction of computer aided drafting and design (CADD or CAD) in the last decades of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century, the drawing board is becoming less common.

A drawing table is also sometimes called a mechanical desk because, for several centuries, most mechanical desks were drawing tables. Unlike the gadgety mechanical desks of the second part of the 18th century, however, the mechanical parts of drawing tables were usually limited to notches, ratchets, and perhaps a few simple gears, or levers or cogs to elevate and incline the working surface.

Very often a drawing table could look like a writing table or even a pedestal desk when the working surface was set at the horizontal and the height adjusted to 29 inches, in order to use it as a &quot;normal&quot; desk. The only giveaway was usually a lip on one of the sides of the desktop. This lip or edge stopped paper or books from sliding when the surface was given an angle. It was also sometimes used to hold writing implements. When the working surface was extended at its full height, a drawing table could be used as a standing desk.

Many reproductions have been made and are still being produced of drawing tables, copying the period styles they were originally made in during the 18th and 19th centuries.

== History ==
In the 18th and 19th centuries, drawing paper was dampened and then its edges glued to the drawing board. After drying the paper would be flat and smooth. The completed drawing was then cut free. Paper could also be secured to the drawing board with drawing pins or even C-clamps. More recent practice is to use self-adhesive drafting tape to secure paper to the board, including the sophisticated use of individualized adhesive dots from a dispensing roll. Some drawing boards are magnetized, allowing paper to be held down by long steel strips. Boards used for overlay drafting or animation may include registration pins or peg bars to ensure alignment of multiple layers of drawing media.

==Contemporary drafting tables==
Despite the prevalence of computer aided drafting, many older architects and even some structural designers still rely on paper and pencil graphics produced on a drafting table.

Modern drafting tables typically rely on a steel frame. Steel provides as much strength as the old oak drafting table frames and much easier portability. Typically the drafting board surface is a thick sheet of compressed fibreboard with sheets of Formica laminated to all its surfaces. The drafting board surface is usually secured to the frame by screws which can easily be removed for drafting table transportation.

The steel frame allows mechanical linkages to be installed that control both the height and angle of the drafting board surface. Typically, a single foot pedal is used to control a clutch which clamps the board in the desired position. A heavy counterweight full of lead shot is installed in the steel linkage so that if the pedal is accidentally released, the drafting board will not spring into the upright position and injure the user. Drafting table linkages and clutches have to be maintained to ensure that this safety mechanism counterbalances the weight of the table surface.

The drafting table surface is usually covered with a thin vinyl sheet called a board cover. This provides an optimum surface for pen and pencil drafting. It allows compasses and dividers to be used without damaging the wooden surface of the board. A board cover must be frequently cleaned to prevent graphite buildup from making new drawings dirty. At the bottom edge of the table, a single strip of aluminum or steel may serve as a place to rest drafting pencils. More purpose-built trays are also used which hold pencils even while the board is being adjusted.

Various types of drafting machine may be attached to the board surface to assist the draftsperson or artist. Parallel rules often span the entire width of the board and are so named because they remain parallel to the top edge of the board as they are moved up and down. Drafting machines use pre-calibrated scales and built in protractors to allow accurate drawing measurement.

Some drafting tables incorporate electric motors to provide the up and down and angle adjustment of the drafting table surface. These tables are at least as heavy as the original oak and brass drafting tables and so sacrifice portability for the convenience of push button table adjustment.

==Modern-day idiom==
The expression &quot;&quot; is used when a plan or course of action needs to be changed, often drastically; usually due to a very unsuccessful result; e.g., &quot;The battle plan, the result of months of conferences, failed because the enemy retreated too far back. It was back to the drawing board for the army captains.&quot;

The phrase was coined in the caption to a Peter Arno cartoon of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; of March 1, 1941.

<doc id="51744" wikidata="Q466255" url="?curid=51744" title="American Pie (song)">
<text>&quot;American Pie&quot; is a song by American singer and songwriter Don McLean. Recorded and released in 1971 on the album of the same name, the single was the number-one US hit for four weeks in 1972 starting January 15 after just eight weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts (where it entered at number 69). The song also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. In the UK, the single reached number 2, where it stayed for three weeks on its original 1971 release, and a reissue in 1991 reached No. 12. The song was listed as the No. 5 song on the RIAA project Songs of the Century. A truncated version of the song was covered by Madonna in 2000 and reached No. 1 in at least 15 countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. At 8 minutes and 42 seconds, McLean&#x27;s combined version is the sixth longest song to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (at the time of release it was the longest). The song also held the record for almost 50 years for being the longest song to reach number one before Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;All Too Well (10 Minute Version)&quot; broke the record in 2021. Due to its exceptional length, it was initially released as a two-sided 7-inch single. &quot;American Pie&quot; has been described as &quot;one of the most successful and debated songs of the 20th century&quot;.

The repeated phrase &quot;the day the music died&quot; refers to a plane crash in 1959 that killed early rock and roll stars Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens, ending the era of early rock and roll; this became the popular nickname for that crash. The theme of the song goes beyond mourning McLean&#x27;s childhood music heroes, reflecting the deep cultural changes and profound disillusion and loss of innocence of his generation – the early rock and roll generation – that took place between the 1959 plane crash and either late 1969 or late 1970. The meaning of the other lyrics, which cryptically allude to many of the jarring events and social changes experienced during that period, has been debated for decades. McLean repeatedly declined to explain the symbolism behind the many characters and events mentioned; he eventually released his songwriting notes to accompany the original manuscript when it was sold in 2015, explaining many of these. McLean further elaborated on the lyrical meaning in a 2022 documentary celebrating the song&#x27;s 50th anniversary, in which he stated the song was driven by impressionism, and debunked some of the more widely speculated symbols.

In 2017, McLean&#x27;s original recording was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. To mark the 50th anniversary of the song, McLean performed a 35-date tour through Europe, starting in Wales and ending in Austria, in 2022.

==Background==

Don McLean drew inspiration for the song from his childhood experience delivering newspapers during the time of the plane crash that killed early rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper:

McLean reportedly wrote &quot;American Pie&quot; in Saratoga Springs, New York, at Caffè Lena, but a 2011 &quot;New York Times&quot; article quotes McLean as disputing this claim. Some employees at Caffè Lena claim that he started writing the song there, and then continued to write the song in both Cold Spring, New York, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. McLean claims that the song was only written in Cold Spring and Philadelphia. Tin &amp; Lint, a bar on Caroline Street in Saratoga Springs, claims the song was written there, and a plaque marks the table. While a 2022 documentary on the history of the song claims Saint Joseph&#x27;s University as where the song was first performed, McLean insists that the song made its debut in Philadelphia at Temple University when he opened for Laura Nyro on March 14, 1971.

The song was produced by Ed Freeman and recorded with a few session musicians. Freeman did not want McLean to play rhythm guitar on the song but eventually relented. McLean and the session musicians rehearsed for two weeks but failed to get the song right. At the last minute, the pianist Paul Griffin was added, which is when the tune came together. McLean used a 1969 or 1970 Martin D-28 guitar to provide the basic chords throughout &quot;American Pie&quot;.

The song debuted in the album &quot;American Pie&quot; in October 1971 and was released as a single in November. The song&#x27;s eight-and-a-half-minute length meant that it could not fit entirely on one side of the 45 RPM record, so United Artists had the first taking up the A-side of the record and the final the B-side. Radio stations initially played the A-side of the song only, but soon switched to the full album version to satisfy their audiences.

Upon the single release, &quot;Cash Box&quot; called it &quot;folk-rock&#x27;s most ambitious and successful epic endeavor since &#x27;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;monumental accomplishment of lyric writing&quot;.

===Interpretations===


The song has nostalgic themes, stretching from the late 1950s until late 1969 or 1970. Except to acknowledge that he first learned about Buddy Holly&#x27;s death on February 3, 1959 – McLean was age 13 – when he was folding newspapers for his paper route on the morning of February 4, 1959 (hence the line &quot;February made me shiver/with every paper I&#x27;d deliver&quot;), McLean has generally avoided responding to direct questions about the song&#x27;s lyrics; he has said: &quot;They&#x27;re beyond analysis. They&#x27;re poetry.&quot; He also stated in an editorial published in 2009, on the 50th anniversary of the crash that killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; Richardson (all of whom are alluded to in the final verse in a comparison with the Christian Holy Trinity), that writing the first verse of the song exorcised his long-running grief over Holly&#x27;s death and that he considers the song to be &quot;a big song... that summed up the world known as America&quot;. McLean dedicated the &quot;American Pie&quot; album to Holly.

Some commentators have identified the song as outlining the darkening of cultural mood, as over time the cultural vanguard passed from Pete Seeger and Joan Baez (the &quot;King and Queen&quot; of folk music), then from Elvis Presley (known as &quot;the King&quot; of Rock and Roll), to Bob Dylan (&quot;the Jester&quot; – who wore a jacket similar to that worn by cultural icon James Dean, was known as &quot;the voice of his generation&quot; (&quot;a voice that came from you and me&quot;), and whose motorcycle accident (&quot;in a cast&quot;) left him in reclusion for many years, recording in studios rather than touring (&quot;on the sidelines&quot;)), to The Beatles (John Lennon, punned with Vladimir Lenin, and &quot;the Quartet&quot; – although McLean has stated the Quartet is a reference to other people), to The Byrds (who wrote one of the first psychedelic rock songs, &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, and then &quot;fell fast&quot; – the song was banned, band member Gene Clark entered rehabilitation, known colloquially as a &quot;fallout shelter&quot;, and shortly after, the group declined as it lost members, changed genres, and alienated fans), to The Rolling Stones (who released &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; and the singles &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; and &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; (&quot;Jack Flash&quot;, &quot;Satan&quot;, &quot;The Devil&quot;), and used Hells Angels – &quot;Angels born in Hell&quot; – as Altamont event security, with fatal consequences, bringing the 1960s to a violent end), and to Janis Joplin (the &quot;girl who sang the blues&quot; but just &quot;turned away&quot; – she died of a heroin overdose the following year).

It has also been speculated that the song contains numerous references to post-World War II American political events, such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy (known casually as &quot;Jack&quot;), First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy (&quot;his widowed bride&quot;), and subsequent killing of his assassin (whose courtroom trial obviously ended as a result [&quot;adjourned&quot;]), the Cuban Missile Crisis (&quot;Jack be nimble, Jack be quick&quot;), the murders of civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, and elements of culture such as sock hops (&quot;kicking off shoes&quot; to dance, preventing damage to the varnished floor), cruising with a pickup truck, the rise of the political protest song (&quot;a voice that came from you and me&quot;), drugs and the counterculture, the Manson Family and the Tate–LaBianca murders in the &quot;summer swelter&quot; of 1969 (the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;) and much more.

Apparent allusions to notable 50s songs include Don Cornell&#x27;s &quot;The Bible Tells Me So&quot; (&quot;If the Bible tells you so?&quot;), Marty Robbins&#x27; &quot;A White Sport Coat&quot;, the lonely teenager (&quot;With a pink carnation&quot;) mirroring Robbins&#x27; narrator who is rejected in favor of another man for the prom, and The Monotones&#x27; &quot;The Book of Love&quot; (&quot;Did you write the book of love&quot;).

Many additional and alternative interpretations have also been proposed.

For example, Bob Dylan&#x27;s first performance in Great Britain was also at a pub called &quot;The King and Queen&quot;, and he also appeared more literally &quot;on the sidelines in a (the) cast&quot; – as one of many stars at the back far right of the cover art of the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (&quot;the Sergeants played a marching tune&quot;).

The song title itself is a reference to apple pie, an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its signature comfort foods, as seen in the popular expression &quot;As American as apple pie&quot;. By the twentieth century, this had become a symbol of American prosperity and national pride.

The original United Artists Records inner sleeve featured a free verse poem written by McLean about William Boyd, also known as Hopalong Cassidy, along with a picture of Boyd in full Hopalong regalia. Its inclusion in the album was interpreted to represent a sense of loss of a simplistic type of American culture as symbolized by Hopalong Cassidy and by extension black and white television as a whole.

Mike Mills of R.E.M. reflected: &quot;&#x27;American Pie&#x27; just made perfect sense to me as a song and that&#x27;s what impressed me the most. I could say to people this is how to write songs. When you&#x27;ve written at least three songs that can be considered classic that is a very high batting average and if one of those songs happens to be something that a great many people think is one of the greatest songs ever written you&#x27;ve not only hit the top of the mountain but you&#x27;ve stayed high on the mountain for a long time.&quot;

===McLean&#x27;s responses===
When asked what &quot;American Pie&quot; meant, McLean jokingly replied, &quot;It means I don&#x27;t ever have to work again if I don&#x27;t want to.&quot; Later, he stated, &quot;You will find many interpretations of my lyrics but none of them by me... Sorry to leave you all on your own like this but long ago I realized that songwriters should make their statements and move on, maintaining a dignified silence.&quot; He also commented on the popularity of his music, &quot;I didn&#x27;t write songs that were just catchy, but with a point of view, or songs about the environment.&quot;

In February 2015, however, McLean announced he would reveal the meaning of the lyrics to the song when the original manuscript went for auction in New York City, in April 2015. The lyrics and notes were auctioned on April 7, 2015, and sold for $1.2 million. In the sale catalogue notes, McLean revealed the meaning in the song&#x27;s lyrics: &quot;Basically in &#x27;American Pie&#x27; things are heading in the wrong direction. It [life] is becoming less idyllic. I don&#x27;t know whether you consider that wrong or right but it is a morality song in a sense.&quot; The catalogue confirmed that the song climaxes with a description of the killing of Meredith Hunter at the Altamont Free Concert, ten years after the plane crash that killed Holly, Valens, and Richardson, and did acknowledge that some of the more well-known symbols in the song were inspired by figures such as Elvis Presley (&quot;the king&quot;) and Bob Dylan (&quot;the jester&quot;).

In 2017, Bob Dylan was asked about how he was referenced in the song. &quot;A jester? Sure, the jester writes songs like &#x27;Masters of War&#x27;, &#x27;A Hard Rain&#x27;s a-Gonna Fall&#x27;, &#x27;It&#x27;s Alright, Ma&#x27; – some jester. I have to think he&#x27;s talking about somebody else. Ask him.&quot;

In 2022, the documentary &quot;The Day the Music Died: The Story of Don McLean&#x27;s American Pie&quot;, produced by Spencer Proffer, was released on the Paramount+ video on-demand service. Proffer said that he told McLean: &quot;It&#x27;s time for you to reveal what 50 years of journalists have wanted to know.&quot; McLean stated that he &quot;needed a big song about America&quot;, and the first verse and melody (&quot;A long, long time ago...&quot;) seemed to just come to mind.

McLean also answered some of the long-standing questions on the song&#x27;s lyrics, although not all. He revealed that Presley was not the king referenced in the song, Joplin was not the &quot;girl who sang the blues&quot;, and Dylan was not the jester, although he is open to other interpretations. He explained that the &quot;marching band&quot; refers to the military–industrial complex, &quot;sweet perfume&quot; refers to tear gas, and Los Angeles is the &quot;coast&quot; that the Trinity head to (&quot;caught the last train for the coast&quot;), commenting &quot;even God has been corrupted&quot;. He also said that the line &quot;This&#x27;ll be the day that I die&quot; originated from the John Wayne film &quot;The Searchers&quot; (which inspired Buddy Holly&#x27;s song &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;), and the chorus&#x27;s line &quot;Bye-bye, Miss American Pie&quot; was inspired by a song by Pete Seeger, &quot;Bye Bye, My Roseanna&quot;. McLean had originally intended to use &quot;Miss American apple pie&quot;, but &quot;apple&quot; was dropped.

On the whole, McLean stated that the lyrics were meant to be impressionist, and that many of the lyrics, only a portion of which were included in the finished recording, were completely fictional with no basis in real-life events.

==Parodies, revisions, and uses==
In 1999, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic wrote and recorded a parody of &quot;American Pie&quot;. Titled &quot;The Saga Begins&quot;, the song recounts the plot of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; from Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x27;s point of view. While McLean gave permission for the parody, he did not make a cameo appearance in its video, despite popular rumor. McLean himself praised the parody, even admitting to almost singing Yankovic&#x27;s lyrics during his own live performances because his children played the song so often. An unrelated comedy film franchise by Universal Pictures, who secured the rights to McLean&#x27;s title, also debuted in 1999.

&quot;American Pie&quot; was the last song to be played on Virgin Radio before it was rebranded as Absolute Radio in 2008. It was also the last song played on BFBS Malta in 1979.

Jeremy Renner sings an a cappella version in the 2006 movie &quot;Love Comes to the Executioner&quot;, as his character walks to the execution chamber.

In 2012, the City of Grand Rapids, Michigan, created a lip dub video to &quot;American Pie&quot; in response to a &quot;Newsweek&quot; article that stated the city was &quot;dying&quot;. (Due to licensing issues, the version used in the video was not the original, but rather a later-recorded live version.) The video was hailed as a fantastic performance by many, including film critic Roger Ebert, who said it was &quot;the greatest music video ever made&quot;.

On March 21, 2013, Harmonix announced that &quot;American Pie&quot; would be the final downloadable track made available for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series of music video games. This was the case until &quot;Rock Band 4&quot; was released on October 6, 2015, reviving the series&#x27; weekly releases of DLC.

On March 14, 2015, the National Museum of Mathematics announced that one of two winners of its songwriting contest was &quot;American Pi&quot; by mathematics education professor Dr. Lawrence M. Lesser. The contest was in honor of &quot;Pi Day of the Century&quot; because &quot;3/14/15&quot; would be the only day in the 21st-century showing the first five digits of π (pi).

On April 20, 2015, John Mayer covered &quot;American Pie&quot; live on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, at the request of the show&#x27;s eponymous host.

On January 29, 2021, McLean released a re-recording of &quot;American Pie&quot; featuring lead vocals by country a cappella group Home Free.

The song was featured in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Black Widow&quot; movie in 2021. It is the favorite song of the character Yelena Belova, and sung by Red Guardian later in the film to comfort her.

&quot;American Pie&quot; is also featured in the 2021 Tom Hanks movie &quot;Finch&quot;.

During his visit to the United States in 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol sang this song at a state dinner. This has attracted worldwide attention, as well as the attention of Don McLean. 

==Madonna version==
===Background and release===
American singer Madonna recorded a cover version of &quot;American Pie&quot; for the soundtrack of her film &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; (2000). Her cover is much shorter than the original, containing only the beginning of the first verse and all of the second and sixth verses. Reworked as a dance-pop track, it was produced by Madonna and William Orbit. It was recorded in September 1999 in New York City, after Rupert Everett, Madonna&#x27;s co-star in &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot;, convinced her to cover the song for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Madonna said of her choice to cover the song: &quot;To me, it&#x27;s a real millennium song. We&#x27;re going through a big change in terms of the way we view pop culture, because of the Internet. In a way, it&#x27;s like saying goodbye to music as we knew it—and to pop culture as we knew it.&quot; &quot;American Pie&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; on February 8, 2000, by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records.

&quot;American Pie&quot; was later included as an international bonus track on her eighth studio album, &quot;Music&quot; (2000). However, it was not included on her greatest hits compilation &quot;GHV2&quot; (2001), as Madonna had regretted putting it on &quot;Music&quot;, elaborating: &quot;It was something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing, but it didn&#x27;t belong on the album so now it&#x27;s being punished... My gut told me not to [put the song on &quot;Music&quot;], but I did it and then I regretted it so just for that reason it didn&#x27;t deserve a place on &quot;GHV2&quot;&quot;. A remix of the song was featured on her remix compilation album &quot;Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones&quot; (2022).

===Reception===
&quot;American Pie&quot; was an international hit, reaching number one in numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Iceland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Finland. The song was the 19th-best-selling single of 2000 in the UK and the ninth best-selling single of 2000 in Sweden. The single was not released commercially in the United States, but it reached number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 due to strong radio airplay.

Chuck Taylor of &quot;Billboard&quot; was impressed by the recording and commented, &quot;Applause to Madonna for not pandering to today&#x27;s temporary trends and for challenging programmers to broaden their playlists. ... In all, a fine preview of the forthcoming soundtrack to &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot;.&quot; Peter Robinson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the cover as &quot;brilliant&quot;. Don McLean himself praised the cover, saying it was &quot;a gift from a goddess&quot;, and that her version is &quot;mystical and sensual&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;, on the other hand, gave it a negative review, saying that &quot;Killdozer did it first and did it better&quot;, that it was &quot;sub-karaoke fluff&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s a blessing she didn&#x27;t bother recording the whole thing.&quot;

In 2017, the Official Charts Company stated the song had sold 400,000 copies in the United Kingdom and was her 16th best selling single to date in the nation.

===Music video===
The music video, filmed in the southern United States and in London, and directed by Philipp Stölzl, depicts a diverse array of ordinary Americans, including scenes showing same-sex couples kissing. Throughout the music video Madonna, who is wearing a tiara on her head, dances and sings in front of a large American flag.

Two versions of the video were produced, the first of which was released as the official video worldwide, and later appeared on Madonna&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2009). The second version used the &quot;Humpty Remix&quot;, a more upbeat and dance-friendly version of the song. The latter aired on MTV in the US to promote &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot;; it features different footage and new outtakes of the original while omitting the lesbian kiss. Everett, who provides backing vocals in the song, is also featured in the video.

* An interpretation of the lyrics based on a supposed interview of McLean by DJ Casey Kasem. McLean later confirmed the Buddy Holly reference in a letter to Adams but denied ever speaking to Kasem.
* This article correlates McLean&#x27;s biography with the historic events in the song. McLean pointed to WCFL (Chicago, Illinois) radio disc jockey Bob Dearborn as the partial basis for most mainstream interpretations of &quot;American Pie&quot;. Dearborn&#x27;s analysis, mailed to listeners on request, bears the date January 7, 1972. Roteman&#x27;s reprinting added photos but replaced the date January 7, 1972, by an audio link bearing the date February 28, 1972, the date Dearborn aired his interpretation on WCFL (http://user.pa.net/~ejjeff/bobpie.ram (Bob Dearborn&#x27;s American Pie Analysis original broadcast February 28, 1972)).
* Among the potpourri is a copy of the January 7, 1972, Bob Dearborn letter, plus an audio recording, in which he delineates his interpretation of &quot;American Pie&quot;.

<text>Baen Books () is an American publishing house for science fiction and fantasy. In science fiction, it emphasizes space opera, hard science fiction, and military science fiction. The company was established in 1983 by science fiction publisher and editor Jim Baen. After his death in 2006, he was succeeded as publisher by long-time executive editor Toni Weisskopf.

==History==
Baen Books was founded in 1983 out of a negotiated agreement between Jim Baen and Simon &amp; Schuster. Simon &amp; Schuster was undergoing massive reorganization and wanted to hire Baen to head and revitalize the science fiction line of its Pocket Books division. Baen, with financial backing from some friends, counteroffered with a proposal to start up a new company named Baen Books and provide Simon &amp; Schuster with a science fiction line to distribute instead.

According to &quot;Locus&quot;″s 2004 Book Summary, Baen Books was the ninth most active publisher in the U.S. in terms of most books published in the genres indicated, and the fifth most active publisher of the dedicated science fiction imprints, publishing a total of 67 titles (of which 40 were original titles). It is difficult to judge the issue of quality but, based on the number of times a title published by Baen Books appeared in the bestseller lists produced by the major bookselling chains, it is ranked the seventh most popular science fiction publisher. In 2005, Baen moved up to the eighth position in the total books published with 72 books published (of which 40 were original titles).

==Electronic publishing==

Beginning in mid-1999, Baen emphasized electronic publishing and Internet-focused promotions for its publications. The discussions on Baen&#x27;s bar convinced him to do so. Baen&#x27;s electronic strategy is explained exhaustively in a series of &quot;letters&quot; or &quot;essays&quot; called The Prime Palaver by Baen Free Library &quot;First Librarian&quot; Eric Flint, but in a nutshell, emphasizes distribution of unencrypted digital versions of its works free of digital rights management copy protection schemes through Baen Ebooks (formerly Webscriptions, which was not formally part of Baen Books, but in effect an independent e-publisher). Baen and his successors believe that DRM does more harm than good to a publisher. Consequently, Baen also makes its entire catalog available in multiple formats for downloading and typically prices electronic versions of its books at or below that of paperback editions—and makes a profit doing it. According to essays on Baen&#x27;s science fiction e-magazine &quot;Jim Baen&#x27;s Universe&quot;, also edited by Flint, the strategy is if anything, getting stronger and more fruitful with the passage of time, especially with the advent of e-book readers such as the Amazon Kindle, and the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook.

===Baen&#x27;s Bar===
Initially, the company invested resources in &quot;Baen&#x27;s Bar&quot;, its online community service that provides a forum for customers, authors, and editors to interact, beginning as a BBS. In the early 2000s, a blogger wrote: &quot;Like every other publisher, Jim Baen set up a website. But several of his authors and fan friends convinced him to put a chat client on his site. Since he was interested, and since several of those authors (like Jerry Pournelle, a former columnist for &quot;Byte Magazine&quot;, for instance) were very Internet savvy, he did. The chat client grew into an incredibly vibrant community called Baen&#x27;s Bar.&quot;

On February 15, 2021, American author Jason Sanford posted via Patreon &quot;Baen Books Forum Being Used to Advocate for Political Violence&quot;. Publisher Toni Weisskopf released a statement saying the Bar will remain closed pending an investigation. The site was reopened on April 9, 2021.

===Baen&#x27;s Webscriptions===
In addition to selling individual titles in electronic format, Baen has distributed serialized e-book versions of new books at reduced prices in monthly bundles. Originally called &quot;Webscriptions&quot;, these &quot;Monthly Baen Bundles&quot; are scheduled three months in advance of print publication. Webscription.net was implemented by Baen&#x27;s preferred website expert, Arnold Bailey, who also sold e-books for other publishers. At the start of 2012, the Webscription.net website was redesigned, renamed to Baen Ebooks, and moved to baenebooks.com. Despite the new name, Baen Ebooks continues to sell e-books for other publishers, notably science fiction genre rival Night Shade Books.

Baen&#x27;s standard setup is based on monthly bundles. Each month, whichever books Baen has coming out in paper (paperback or hardcover, new or reissued) are bundled put together in a fixed price (currently $20) bundle regardless of the number of books (historically 4–9 books, average 5–6). The &quot;Monthly Baen Bundles&quot; are released in installments beginning three months prior to physical publication. The first installment released three months prior to paper publication includes roughly a half of every book in the bundle, with some books usually included in their entirety. The second installment, two months prior to print publication includes roughly three quarters, and the third installment on the 16th of the month prior to official print release includes the full text. The first two installments are generally available only as HTML, while the last includes all formats supported. Each bundle can only be bought until the 15th of the month prior to official print publication, which is about the time the printed books reach retailers. (Until December 2012, bundles remained on sale indefinitely.)

Another avenue for distribution that Baen uses for some of its new titles is the offering of (electronic advance reading copies) 3 to 5 months prior to publication. Marketed as a premium product for the fans who absolutely positively have to read it now, they are priced at $15 per single title and can differ from the final text (as they are electronic proofs). After print publication, the &quot;cleaned up and finalized&quot; electronic copy is available both online through the monthly bundle or as a single title (priced variably $7–10, older titles are less).

The electronic versions by Baen are produced in five common formats (HTML, Palm Pilot/Mobipocket/Kindle format, Rocketbook, EPUB/Stanza, Sony LRF, RTF, and MS Reader versions), all unencrypted in drastic contrast to the rest of the e-publishing industries strategy. Jim Baen disliked Adobe&#x27;s portable document format for reading purposes, but Baen Ebooks offers some non-Baen titles in that format. When customers purchase a title from Baen, they can read it online or download it in any format they want as often as they want. Baen instituted a parallel practice of using promotional CD-ROMs with permissive copyright licenses containing many of its stable of authors&#x27; works. Whether downloaded or by CD-ROM, the source material is available in all the formats Baen supports.

The great majority of books published by Baen are still available as e-books, long after the hardcover or paperback versions have gone out of print. This is especially important for midlist titles, which rarely get reprinted. Until December 2012, it was also possible to purchase older monthly bundles.

Baen has made liberal use of free content in its marketing efforts. For example, free sample chapters of its books are typically available on the Baen Web site. The &quot;Baen Free Library&quot; allows free access to dozens of titles from the company&#x27;s backlist, often the first book published in a series by a Baen author. Baen also provides free electronic copies of its books to readers who are blind, paralyzed, dyslexic, or are amputees.

Baen&#x27;s emphasis on electronic publishing has generated press coverage for the company. In 2001, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine described Webscriptions as &quot;innovative&quot;. Charles N. Brown, publisher of &quot;Locus&quot; magazine, has praised Baen&#x27;s approach in an interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying &quot;Baen has shown that putting up electronic versions of books doesn&#x27;t cost you sales. It gains you a larger audience for all of your books. As a result, they&#x27;ve done quite well.&quot;

===Magazine experiments===
Baen&#x27;s first run at magazine-style book publishing took place in the late 1970s, in the form of &quot;Destinies&quot;, a quarterly &#x27;bookazine&#x27; that featured fiction and non-fiction by well-known and new authors that Baen was promoting. It was published by Ace, where Baen was employed at the time. Under the aegis of Baen Books in the 1980s, he published two more bookazine series. The first was &quot;Far Frontiers&quot;. The second was &quot;New Destinies&quot;, edited by Baen, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Michael A. Banks.

==== &quot;The Grantville Gazettes&quot; ====
Baen&#x27;s began the experimental publication of &quot;The Grantville Gazette&quot;, an e-magazine anthology series specifically related to the popular &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; alternate history plenum. The &quot;Gazettes&quot; are professionally edited and approved fan fiction. They are published on a regular schedule and available individually at Baen Books or Amazon, or by subscription.

==== &quot;Jim Baen&#x27;s Universe&quot; ====
In the early 2000s, Baen tried magazine-like publishing again, establishing two self-sustaining e-zine enterprises with a separate staff for each, both spearheaded by Eric Flint: &quot;Jim Baen&#x27;s Universe&quot; and the &quot;Grantville Gazette&quot; series, which was reconfigured after &quot;Grantville Gazette V&quot;.

The general audience speculative fiction anthology &quot;Baen&#x27;s Universe&quot; is available only online. At approximately 120,000 words, this latter publication is unusually large when compared to most traditional print editions of science fiction magazines, and the average size of the newly reconfigured &quot;Gazette&quot;s is similarly generous.

===Baen Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)===
From 1999 to 2011, Baen&#x27;s e-books were produced by Webscriptions under contract for Baen Books in various (at least five) common digital formats. Because these multiple formats complicate the issue of identifying electronic versions, Baen and Webscriptions did not use DOIs to identify their e-books (even though some of their books had DOIs). The electronic e-ARC practices also complicate things in &quot;publications dates&quot;, since the first released text starts two to three months before the release of the print copy, though the released text is not guaranteed to fully copy edited—and so occasionally differs from the final released fully copy-edited versions. Thus, like the &quot;Grantville Gazettes&quot; the e-publication date antedates the print copy by about two months—the interval before the release of the last third and the hardcover print edition is simultaneously released.

<text>Cisco Systems, Inc. (using the trademark Cisco) is an American multinational digital communications technology conglomerate corporation headquartered in San Jose, California. Cisco develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment and other high-technology services and products. Cisco specializes in specific tech markets, such as the Internet of things (IoT), domain security, videoconferencing, and energy management with products including Webex, OpenDNS, Jabber, Duo Security, Silicon One, and Jasper.

Cisco Systems was founded in December 1984 by Leonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner, two Stanford University computer scientists who had been instrumental in connecting computers at Stanford. They pioneered the concept of a local area network (LAN) being used to connect distant computers over a multiprotocol router system. The company went public in 1990 and, by the end of the dot-com bubble in 2000, had a market capitalization of $500 billion, surpassing Microsoft as the world&#x27;s most valuable company.

Cisco stock (CSCO) was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average on June 8, 2009, and is also included in the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq-100, the Russell 1000, and the Russell 1000 Growth Stock indices.

== History ==

=== 1984–1995: Origins and initial growth ===
Cisco Systems was founded in December 1984 by Sandy Lerner along with her husband Leonard Bosack. Lerner was the director of computer facilities for the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. Bosack was in charge of the Stanford University computer science department&#x27;s computers.

Cisco&#x27;s initial product has roots in Stanford University&#x27;s campus technology. In the early 1980s students and staff at Stanford, including Bosack, used technology on the campus to link all of the school&#x27;s computer systems to talk to one another, creating a box that functioned as a multiprotocol router called the &quot;Blue Box&quot;. The Blue Box used circuitry made by Andy Bechtolsheim, and software that was originally written at Stanford by research engineer William Yeager. Due to the underlying architecture, and its ability to scale well, Yeager&#x27;s well-designed invention became a key to Cisco&#x27;s early success.

In 1985, Bosack and Stanford employee Kirk Lougheed began a project to formally network Stanford&#x27;s campus. They adapted Yeager&#x27;s software into what became the foundation for Cisco IOS, despite Yeager&#x27;s claims that he had been denied permission to sell the Blue Box commercially. On July 11, 1986, Bosack and Lougheed were forced to resign from Stanford and the university contemplated filing criminal complaints against Cisco and its founders for the theft of its software, hardware designs, and other intellectual properties. In 1987, Stanford licensed the router software and two computer boards to Cisco. In addition to Bosack, Lerner, Lougheed, Greg Satz (a programmer), and Richard Troiano (who handled sales), completed the early Cisco team. The company&#x27;s first CEO was Bill Graves, who held the position from 1987 to 1988. In 1988, John Morgridge was appointed CEO.

The name &quot;Cisco&quot; was derived from the city name &quot;San Francisco&quot;, which is why the company&#x27;s engineers insisted on using the lower case &quot;cisco&quot; in its early years. The logo is a stylized depiction of the two towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.

On February 16, 1990, Cisco Systems went public with a market capitalization of $224 million, and was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. On August 28, 1990, Lerner was fired. Upon hearing the news, her husband Bosack resigned in protest.

Although Cisco was not the first company to develop and sell dedicated network nodes, it was one of the first to sell commercially successful routers supporting multiple network protocols. Classical, CPU-based architecture of early Cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system IOS allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent software upgrades. Some popular models of that time (such as Cisco 2500) managed to stay in production for almost a decade virtually unchanged. The company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment, entering the SP market with product lines such as Cisco 7000 and Cisco 8500.

Between 1992 and 1994, Cisco acquired several companies in Ethernet switching, such as Kalpana, Grand Junction and most notably, Mario Mazzola&#x27;s Crescendo Communications, which together formed the Catalyst business unit. At the time, the company envisioned layer 3 routing and layer 2 (Ethernet, Token Ring) switching as complementary functions of different intelligence and architecture—the former was slow and complex, the latter was fast but simple. This philosophy dominated the company&#x27;s product lines throughout the 1990s.

In 1995, John Morgridge was succeeded by John T. Chambers.

=== 1996–2005: Internet and silicon intelligence ===

The Internet Protocol (IP) became widely adopted in the mid-to-late 1990s. Cisco introduced products ranging from modem access shelves (AS5200) to core GSR routers, making them a major player in the market. In late March 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, Cisco became the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion. As of July 2014, with a market cap of about US$129 billion, it was still one of the most valuable companies.

The perceived complexity of programming routing functions in silicon led to the formation of several startups determined to find new ways to process IP and MPLS packets entirely in hardware and blur boundaries between routing and switching. One of them, Juniper Networks, shipped their first product in 1999 and by 2000 chipped away about 30% from Cisco SP Market share. In response, Cisco later developed homegrown ASICs and fast processing cards for GSR routers and Catalyst 6500 switches. In 2004, Cisco also started the migration to new high-end hardware CRS-1 and software architecture IOS XR.

=== 2006–2012: The Human Network ===

As part of a rebranding campaign in 2006, Cisco Systems adopted the shortened name &quot;Cisco&quot; and created &quot;The Human Network&quot; advertising campaign. These efforts were meant to make Cisco a &quot;household&quot; brand—a strategy designed to support the low-end Linksys products and future consumer products.

On the more traditional business side, Cisco continued to develop its routing, switching and security portfolio. The quickly growing importance of Ethernet also influenced the company&#x27;s product lines. Limits of IOS and aging Crescendo architecture also forced Cisco to look at merchant silicon in the carrier Ethernet segment. This resulted in a new ASR 9000 product family intended to consolidate the company&#x27;s carrier Ethernet and subscriber management business around EZChip-based hardware and IOS-XR.

In March 2007, Cisco acquired Reactivity Inc, a privately held XML gateway provider based in Redwood City, California. Cisco placed the Reactivity team and product portfolio under its Datacenter Switching and Security Technology Group, which reported to the company&#x27;s then senior vice president Jayshree Ullal.

Throughout the mid-2000s, Cisco also built a significant presence in India, establishing its Globalization Centre East in Bangalore for $1 billion. Cisco also expanded into new markets by acquisition—one example being a 2009 purchase of mobile specialist Starent Networks.

Cisco continued to be challenged by both domestic competitors Alcatel-Lucent, Juniper Networks, and an overseas competitor Huawei. Due to lower-than-expected profit in 2011, Cisco reduced annual expenses by $1 billion. The company cut around 3,000 employees with an early-retirement program who accepted a buyout and planned to eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs (around 14 percent of the 73,400 total employees before curtailment). During the 2011 analyst call, Cisco&#x27;s CEO John Chambers called out several competitors by name, including Juniper and HP.

On July 24, 2012, Cisco received approval from the EU to acquire NDS (a TV software developer) for US$5 billion. In 2013, Cisco sold its Linksys home-router unit to Belkin International Inc., signaling a shift to sales to businesses rather than consumers.

=== 2013–present ===

On July 23, 2013, Cisco Systems announced a definitive agreement to acquire Sourcefire for $2.7 billion. On August 14, 2013, Cisco Systems announced it would cut 4,000 jobs from its workforce, which was roughly 6%, starting in 2014. At the end of 2013, Cisco announced poor revenue due to depressed sales in emerging markets, caused by economic uncertainty and by fears of the National Security Agency planting backdoors in its products.

In April 2014, Cisco announced funding for early-stage firms to focus on the Internet of Things. The investment fund was allocated to investments in IoT accelerators and startups such as The Alchemist Accelerator, Ayla Networks and EVRYTHNG. Later that year, the company announced it was laying off another 6,000 workers or 8% of its global workforce, as part of a second restructuring. On November 4, 2014, Cisco announced an investment in Stratoscale.

On May 4, 2015, Cisco announced CEO and Chairman John Chambers would step down as CEO on July 26, 2015, but remain chairman. Chuck Robbins, senior vice president of worldwide sales &amp; operations and 17-year Cisco veteran, was announced as the next CEO. On July 23, 2015, Cisco announced the divestiture of its television set-top-box and cable modem business to Technicolor SA for $600 million, a division originally formed by Cisco&#x27;s $6.9 billion purchase of Scientific Atlanta. The deal came as part of Cisco&#x27;s gradual exit from the consumer market, and as part of an effort by Cisco&#x27;s new leadership to focus on cloud-based products in enterprise segments. Cisco indicated that it would still collaborate with Technicolor on video products. On November 19, 2015, Cisco, alongside ARM Holdings, Dell, Intel, Microsoft and Princeton University, founded the OpenFog Consortium, to promote interests and development in fog computing.

In January 2016, Cisco invested in VeloCloud, a software-defined WAN (SD-WAN) start-up with a cloud offering for configuring and optimizing branch office networks. Cisco contributed to VeloCloud&#x27;s $27 million Series C round, led by March Capital Partners.

In February 2017, Cisco launched a cloud-based secure internet gateway, called Cisco Umbrella, to provide safe internet access to users who do not use their corporate networks or VPNs to connect to remote data centers. Immediately after reporting their fourth-quarter earnings for 2017, Cisco&#x27;s price-per-share value jumped by over 7%, while its earnings per share ratio increased from 60 to 61 cents per share, due in part to Cisco&#x27;s outperformance of analyst expectations. In September 2017, Chambers announced that he would step down from the executive chairman role at the end of his term on the board in December 2017. On December 11, 2017, Robbins was elected to succeed Chambers as executive chairman while retaining his role as CEO, and Chambers was given the title of &quot;Chairman Emeritus&quot;.

Reuters reported that &quot;Cisco Systems Inc&#x27;s (CSCO.O) product revenue in Russia grew 20 percent in 2017, ahead of Cisco&#x27;s technology product revenue growth in the other so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, China and India.&quot;

On May 1, 2018, Cisco Systems agreed to buy AI-driven business intelligence startup Accompany for $270 million. As of June 2018, Cisco Systems ranked 444th on Forbes Global 2000 list, with $221.3 billion market cap.

In 2019, Cisco acquired CloudCherry, a customer experience management company, and Voicea, an artificial intelligence company.

In 2019, Cisco also introduced the &quot;Silicon One&quot; ASIC chip with the G100 model reaching a speed of 25.6 Tbit/s. The Silicon One competes against the Tomahawk series by Broadcom the Nvidia Spectrum, the Marvell Teralynx and the Intel Tofino. In 2023, the Silicon One G200 will offer a speed of 51.2 Tbit/sec.

== Corporate structure ==
===Acquisitions and subsidiaries===

Cisco acquired a variety of companies to spin products and talent into the company. In 1995–1996 the company completed 11 acquisitions. Several acquisitions, such as Stratacom, were one of the biggest deals in the industry when they occurred. During the Internet boom in 1999, the company acquired Cerent Corporation, a start-up company located in Petaluma, California, for about US$7 billion. It was the most expensive acquisition made by Cisco to that date, and only the acquisition of Scientific Atlanta has been larger. In 1999, Cisco also acquired a stake for $1 billion in KPMG Consulting to enable establishing Internet firm Metrius founded by Keyur Patel of Fuse. Several acquired companies have grown into $1Bn+ business units for Cisco, including LAN switching, Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) platform Webex and home networking. The latter came as result of Cisco acquiring Linksys in 2003 and in 2010 was supplemented with new product line dubbed Cisco Valet.

Cisco announced on January 12, 2005, that it would acquire Airespace for US$450 million to reinforce the wireless controller product lines.

Cisco announced on January 4, 2007, that it would buy IronPort in a deal valued at US$830 million and completed the acquisition on June 25, 2007. IronPort was best known for its IronPort AntiSpam, its SenderBase email reputation service and its email security appliances. Accordingly, IronPort was integrated into the Cisco Security business unit. Ironport&#x27;s Senderbase was renamed as Sensorbase to take account of the input into this database that other Cisco devices provide. SensorBase allows these devices to build a risk profile on IP addresses, therefore allowing risk profiles to be dynamically created on http sites and SMTP email sources.

In 2010, Cisco bought Starent Networks (a mobile packet core company) for $2.9 billion and Moto Development Group, a product design consulting firm that helped develop Cisco&#x27;s Flip video camera. Also in 2010, Cisco became a key stakeholder in &quot;e-Skills Week&quot;. In March 2011, Cisco completed the acquisition of privately held network configuration and change management software company Pari Networks.

Although many buy-ins (such as Crescendo Networks in 1993, Tandberg in 2010) resulted in acquisition of flagship technology to Cisco, many others have failed—partially or completely. For instance, in 2010 Cisco occupied a meaningful share of the packet-optical market, revenues were still not on par with US$7 billion price tag paid in 1999 for Cerent. Some of acquired technologies (such as Flip from Pure Digital) saw their product lines terminated.

=== Network Emergency Response ===

As part of its Crisis Response initiative, Cisco maintains several Network Emergency Response Vehicles (NERV)s. The vehicles are maintained and deployed by Cisco employees during natural disasters and other public crises. The vehicles are self-contained and provide wired and wireless services including voice and radio interoperability, voice over IP, network-based video surveillance and secured high-definition video-conferencing for leaders and first responders in crisis areas with up to 3-72 Mbit/s of bandwidth (up and down) via a 1.8-meter satellite antenna.

NERVs are based at Cisco headquarters sites in San Jose, California, and at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, allowing strategic deployment in North America. They can become fully operational within 15 minutes of arrival. High-capacity diesel fuel-tanks allow the largest vehicles to run for up to 72 hours continuously. The NERV has been deployed to incidents such as the October 2007 California wildfires; hurricanes Gustav, Ike and Katrina; the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion, tornado outbreaks in North Carolina and Alabama in 2011; and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

The Crisis Response Operations team maintains and deploys smaller, more portable communication kits to emergencies outside of North America. In 2010, the team deployed to assist in earthquake recovery in Haiti and Christchurch (New Zealand). In 2011, they deployed to flooding in Brazil, as well as in response to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

In 2011, Cisco received the Innovation Preparedness award from the American Red Cross Silicon Valley Chapter for its development and use of these vehicles in disasters.

== Controversies ==
=== Shareholder relations ===
A class action lawsuit filed on April 20, 2001, accused Cisco of making misleading statements that &quot;were relied on by purchasers of Cisco stock&quot; and of insider trading. While Cisco denied all allegations in the suit, on August 18, 2006, Cisco&#x27;s liability insurers, its directors and officers paid the plaintiffs US$91.75 million to settle the suit.

=== Intellectual property disputes ===
On December 11, 2008, the Free Software Foundation filed suit against Cisco regarding Cisco&#x27;s failure to comply with the GPL and LGPL licenses and make the applicable source code publicly available. On May 20, 2009, Cisco settled this lawsuit by complying with FSF licensing terms and making a monetary contribution to the FSF.

In October 2020, Cisco was ordered to pay US$1.9 billion to Centripetal Networks for infringement on four cybersecurity patents.

=== Censorship in China ===
Cisco has been criticized for its involvement in censorship in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. According to author Ethan Gutmann, Cisco and other telecommunications equipment providers supplied the Chinese government with surveillance and Internet infrastructure equipment that is used to block Internet websites and track online activities in China. Cisco has stated that it does not customize or develop specialized or unique filtering capabilities to enable governments to block access to information and that it sells the same equipment in China as it sells worldwide.

Wired News had uncovered a purported leaked, confidential PowerPoint presentation from Cisco that detailed the commercial opportunities of the Golden Shield Project of Internet control. In May 2011, a group of Falun Gong practitioners filed a lawsuit under the Alien Tort Statute alleging that Cisco knowingly developed and customized its product to assist the Chinese government in prosecution and abuse of Falun Gong practitioners. The lawsuit was dismissed in September 2014 by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, which decision was appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in September 2015. On July 7, 2023, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court&#x27;s decision and ruled the lawsuit may proceed to trial.

=== Tax fraud investigation ===
In October 2007, employees of Cisco&#x27;s Brazilian unit were arrested on charges that they had imported equipment without paying import duties. In response, Cisco stated that they do not import directly into Brazil, and instead use middlemen.

=== Antitrust lawsuit ===
On December 1, 2008, Multiven filed an antitrust lawsuit against Cisco Systems, Inc. Multiven&#x27;s complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes/patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services (SMARTnet). In May 2010, Cisco accused the person who filed the antitrust suit, British-Nigerian technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye, with hacking and pressured the US government to extradite him from Canada. Cisco settled the antitrust lawsuit two months after Alfred-Adekeye&#x27;s arrest by making its software updates available to all Multiven customers.

=== Remotely monitoring users&#x27; connections ===
Cisco&#x27;s Linksys E2700, E3500, E4500 devices have been reported to be remotely updated to a firmware version that forces users to register for a cloud service, allows Cisco to monitor their network use and ultimately shut down the cloud service account and thus render the affected router unusable.

=== Firewall backdoor developed by NSA ===
According to the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; the NSA has developed JETPLOW for gaining access to ASA (series 5505, 5510, 5520, 5540 and 5550) and 500-series PIX Firewalls.

Cisco&#x27;s Chief Security Officer addressed the allegations publicly and denied working with any government to weaken Cisco products for exploitation or to implement security backdoors.

A document included in the trove of National Security Agency files released with Glenn Greenwald&#x27;s book &quot;No Place to Hide&quot; details how the agency&#x27;s Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit and other NSA employees intercept servers, routers and other network gear being shipped to organizations targeted for surveillance and install covert firmware onto them before they are delivered. These Trojan horse systems were described by an NSA manager as being &quot;some of the most productive operations in TAO because they pre-position access points into hard target networks around the world.&quot;

Cisco denied the allegations in a customer document saying that no information was included about specific Cisco products, supply chain intervention or implant techniques, or new security vulnerabilities. Cisco&#x27;s general counsel also said that Cisco does not work with any government, including the United States government, to weaken its products. The allegations are reported to have prompted the company&#x27;s CEO to express concern to the President of the United States. Whistle blowers like Edward Snowden, and journalist reporter Julian Assange have echoed similar sentiments publicly.

=== Spherix patent suit ===
In March 2014, Cisco Systems was sued for patent infringement. Spherix says that over $43 billion of Cisco&#x27;s sales infringe on old Nortel patents owned by Spherix. Officials with Spherix are saying that a wide range of Cisco products, from switches to routers, infringe on 11 former Nortel patents that the company now owns.

=== India net censorship role ===
 Cisco Systems is alleged to be helping the Indian Jammu and Kashmir administration build a firewall that will prevent Internet users in Kashmir from accessing blacklisted websites, including social media portals, through fixed-line connections. Cisco denies the allegations.

=== Caste discrimination lawsuit ===
In 2020, a lawsuit was initiated against Cisco and two of its employees by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing for alleged discrimination against an Indian engineer on account of him being from a lower caste than them.

=== Xinjiang ===
In 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including Cisco, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang.

<text>Marcel &quot;Marco&quot; van Basten (; born 31 October 1964) is a Dutch former football manager and player who played as a striker for Ajax and AC Milan, as well as the Netherlands national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he scored 300 goals in a high-profile career, but played his last match in 1993, at the age of 28, due to recurring ankle injury which forced him to announce his retirement two years later. He was later the head coach of Ajax and the Netherlands national team.

Known for his close ball control, attacking intelligence, impeccable headers, and spectacular strikes and volleys, Van Basten was named FIFA World Player of the Year in 1992 and won the Ballon d&#x27;Or three times, in 1988, 1989 and 1992. At club level, he won three Eredivisie titles and the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with Ajax, and four Serie A titles and two European Cups with Milan. With the Netherlands, Van Basten won UEFA Euro 1988 where he earned the Golden Boot, scoring five goals, including a memorable volley in the final against the Soviet Union, considered one of the best ever.

In 1998, Van Basten was ranked sixth in the FIFA Player of the Century internet poll, tenth in the European player of the Century election held by the IFFHS and 12th in the IFFHS&#x27; World Player of the Century election. He was also voted eighth in a poll organised by the French magazine &quot;France Football&quot;, consulting their former Ballon d&#x27;Or winners to elect the Football Player of the Century. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players. In 2004, a poll for the 100 greatest Dutch people was held in the Netherlands: Van Basten ranked number 25, the second highest for a football player, behind Johan Cruyff. In 2007, &quot;Sky Sports&quot; ranked Van Basten first on its list of great athletes who had their careers cut short.

==Playing career==
===Early years===
Marco van Basten was born on 31 October 1964 in Utrecht and grew up in the &quot;Oog In Al&quot; neighborhood. He began playing for a local team, EDO, when he was six years old. A year later, he moved to UVV Utrecht. After nine years there, he briefly played for another club from Utrecht, Elinkwijk.

===Ajax===
Ajax signed 16-year-old Marco for the 1981–82 season after his 19-year-old brother Stanley was rejected. Their father Joop had kept the younger son at another club with the hope that Ajax would take Stanley in professionally. He played his first match for Ajax on 3 April 1982, coming on as a substitute for Johan Cruyff, and scoring a debut goal in the team&#x27;s 5–0 victory over NEC.

In the 1982–83 season, he competed with the European top scorer and first choice Holland international Wim Kieft for the position of centre forward, and scored nine goals in 20 league matches. Ajax chose to sell Kieft to Italian Serie A club Pisa the following season, and 18 year old Van Basten solidified his position as his team&#x27;s main attacker similarly in the national team.

He was the top scorer in the league for four consecutive seasons, from 1983–84 to 1986–87, scoring 118 goals in 112 matches. In the 1985–86 season, he scored 37 goals in 26 league matches, including six goals against Sparta Rotterdam and five against Heracles Almelo, and won the European Golden Boot. He also scored the winning goal in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final against Lokomotive Leipzig in 1987. In total he scored 128 goals in 133 league matches for Ajax. In November 1986 he scored his most famous goal in an Ajax jersey, a spectacular overhead kick against FC Den Bosch.

===AC Milan===
In 1987, Milan president Silvio Berlusconi signed Van Basten, along with fellow countryman Ruud Gullit. In 1988, the Dutch legion got completed when Frank Rijkaard joined the club (at the time only three non-Italians were allowed). In his first season, Milan won their first &quot;Scudetto&quot; in eight years, but Van Basten played only 11 matches and was constantly troubled by an ankle injury. In 1988–89, Van Basten won the Ballon d&#x27;Or as Europe&#x27;s top footballer. He scored 19 goals in Serie A and 32 goals in all competitions that year, including two goals in the final of the European Cup, as Milan triumphed against Steaua București. In 1989–90, he became &quot;Capocannoniere&quot; again (Serie A&#x27;s leading goal scorer); Milan also successfully defended the European Cup after beating Benfica 1–0 in the final match, during which Van Basten provided the assist for Rijkaard&#x27;s match-winning goal.

Milan struggled in the 1990–91 season, as Sampdoria won the &quot;Scudetto&quot;. After Van Basten fell out with Arrigo Sacchi, Berlusconi sacked the manager. Fabio Capello took over the following season, and Milan went undefeated in the league to win another &quot;Scudetto&quot;. Van Basten scored 25 league goals, and became &quot;Capocannoniere&quot; again; his tally from the 1991–92 season was the highest number of goals that a player had scored in a single Serie A season since Luís Vinício achieved the same tally during the 1965–66 season.
In November 1992, he became the first player to score four goals in a Champions League match, against IFK Göteborg, including a picture perfect bicycle kick. In December 1992, Van Basten was named FIFA World Player of the Year. Milan stretched their unbeaten run into the 1992–93 season, going 58 matches over two seasons before they lost a match. Van Basten was exceptional in the early part of the season. He was again voted the European player of the year, becoming the third player after Johan Cruyff and Michel Platini to win the award three times.

His troublesome ankle injury recurred in a game against Ancona, forcing him to endure another six-month layoff, and undergo a series of surgeries. He returned for the last few matches in the season, before Milan lost 1–0 to Marseille in the Champions League final. The match was Van Basten&#x27;s final match for the Italian club. He came off in the 86th minute for Stefano Eranio, after a hard tackle behind from Basile Boli condemned Van Basten to the third ankle surgery of his career.

Van Basten had been hopeful of playing for his country at the 1994 World Cup as well as for his club in the 1994–95 season after spending the whole 1993–94 season out of action (missing Milan&#x27;s victory in the European Cup as well as their Serie A title glory), but his club ordered him not to take part in the World Cup amid fear of ruining his rehabilitation. He finally conceded defeat in his battle to recover on 17 August 1995, when he announced his retirement as a player after two whole years on the sidelines. Van Basten made a farewell appearance to thank the Milan fans before a home game at the San Siro, with an emotional Milan coach Fabio Capello breaking down in tears.

==International career==

In 1984, Van Basten debuted for the Netherlands national football team during a UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying against Iceland.

At UEFA Euro 1988, Van Basten played a pivotal role in the Dutch team&#x27;s victorious campaign. He scored a total of five goals, including a hat-trick against England in the first round, the winning goal in the semi-final against West Germany, and a spectacular volley from an acute angle in the 2–0 final against the Soviet Union, during which he also provided the assist for Gullit&#x27;s opening goal. He finished the competition as the top scorer and was named player of the tournament. He was also included in team of the tournament. In a 2002 UK poll, Van Basten&#x27;s volley against the Soviet Union was ranked #21 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.

The Dutch national team exited the 1990 World Cup early, losing 2–1 to eventual champions West Germany in the second round. Van Basten never scored in the World Cup finals. At UEFA Euro 1992, the Netherlands defeated reigning World Champions Germany 3–1 in the first round to top their group and reach the semi-finals, where they surprisingly lost to the eventual champions Denmark in a penalty shoot-out, with Peter Schmeichel saving a penalty shot from Van Basten. Although he went scoreless throughout the tournament, he was included in team of the tournament for the second time in 1992.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
Regarded as one of the greatest and most complete strikers and players in the history of the sport, due to his prolific goalscoring and great skill set, Van Basten was dubbed the &quot;Swan Of Utrecht&quot; for his elegance and intelligent attacking play, and was known for his penchant for scoring acrobatic goals. His height and strength allowed him to excel in the air, and his technical ability and agility saw him execute spectacular strikes throughout his career, such as volleys and bicycle kicks. A fast and opportunistic striker with quick reactions and excellent movement, he often took advantage of loose balls in the penalty area due to his ability to anticipate defenders, and was capable of both controlling fast and difficult balls well with one touch, or even shooting first time. Possessing a powerful and accurate shot, and clinical, varied finishing from anywhere along the pitch, he was capable of scoring goals with either foot from inside or outside the penalty area, as well as with his head; he was also an accurate penalty kick and free-kick taker. Throughout his career, Van Basten converted 53 penalties out of the 57 he took, with a 93.0% success rate, the sixth highest in history, behind Ledio Pano (100%), Matthew Le Tissier (97.9%), Zico (97.8%), Cuauhtémoc Blanco (97.3%), and Ferenc Puskás (96.7%). Before taking penalties, Van Basten often used to perform a characteristic hop.

Although he was mainly known as a traditional attacker who operated in the penalty area as a centre-forward throughout his career, Van Basten also possessed excellent vision and distribution, in addition to his goalscoring ability, which enabled him to play in deeper, more creative positions, as a second striker, for example, and which allowed him to participate in the build-up of attacking plays and provide assists to his teammates in addition to scoring goals himself; one of his most notable assists was the one he provided to Frank Rijkaard for Milan&#x27;s winning goal in the 1990 European Cup final against Benfica. Despite his large stature, Van Basten possessed excellent technical skills and ball control, as well as good balance and a notable elegance on the ball, which inspired his nickname. As such, his strong physique, combined with his close control, also enabled him to hold up the ball for teammates when playing with his back to goal.

Despite his ability, Van Basten&#x27;s career was severely affected by many grave injuries, which eventually forced him to retire from football prematurely at the age of 28. Lack of protection from referees and inadequate football rules against rugged defending and tackles from behind were identified as the source of the injuries which ultimately led to his career&#x27;s demise; consequently, Van Basten&#x27;s early retirement due to his injuries led to widespread debate in the football world over whether rash challenges from behind should be rendered illegal in football, in order to protect talented players more effectively. During the 1994 World Cup, an automatic red was also shown for tackles from behind or with studs showing. In 1998, prior to the World Cup that year, FIFA completely outlawed the tackle from behind; this ruling came to be known colloquially as the &quot;Van Basten law&quot; in the media. Although Van Basten was known for often being on the receiving end of hard challenges from his opponents throughout his career, former referee Daniele Tombolini described Van Basten as a player who was known for his physical play himself, and who utilised his strength and committed a lot of fouls during matches.

===Reception and legacy===
Considered by pundits to be one of the greatest and most complete players of all time, in 1998, Van Basten was ranked sixth in the FIFA Player of the Century internet poll, tenth in the European player of the Century election held by the IFFHS, and 12th in the IFFHS World Player of the Century election. He was also ranked eighth in a poll to determine &quot;France Football&quot;″s &quot;Football Player of the Century.&quot; In 1999, Van Basten was named the ninth greatest player of the twentieth Century by &quot;World Soccer&quot; magazine. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100, his list of the world&#x27;s 125 greatest living players, and also placed fourth in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll, celebrating the best European footballers of the past fifty years. He was also ranked 25th in a poll for the 100 greatest Dutch people. In 2007, &quot;Sky Sports&quot; ranked Van Basten first on its list of great athletes who had their careers cut short. In 2016 Van Basten was included in UEFA&#x27;s All-time Euro XI, while in 2017, he was named the 13th greatest player of all time by &quot;FourFourTwo&quot;.
Numerous players, managers, and other footballing figures have also lauded Van Basten as one of the greatest players of all time. In 1994, defender Pietro Vierchowod described Van Basten as &quot;the absolute number one&quot; and as a &quot;superstar,&quot; also adding that &quot;he is strong with his head, good with either foot, capable of changing the face of a game with a single play or, [even] when he is not at his best, of becoming the best assist-provider for his teammates.&quot; Former defender Jürgen Kohler, who often faced Van Basten throughout his career, described him as &quot;a player with exceptional abilities. He was a big personality not only as a sportsman, but also as a private person. I benefited from him. It is as simple as this. He was a big milestone in my career and for me he is one of the players who are the most outstanding personalities of the last century. Not only in sports, also as a human being.&quot; When asked of their duels, he commented: &quot;the duels between us were simply tough with everything football offers. He stood and I delivered and then I stood and he delivered.&quot;

Former Arsenal player Tony Adams described Van Basten as the toughest and most difficult opponent he had ever faced in 2006, stating: &quot;He’s the quickest 6 ft 3 in centre-forward I’ve ever seen! Just awesome. He was as quick as Ian Wright, as good in the air as Joe Jordan and he held the ball up better than Alan Smith. I put him in front of Maradona. Technically, Maradona was brilliant and he had amazing feet, but [V]an Basten could head, volley – he had power and strength.&quot; Fellow former defender Giuseppe Bergomi also described Van Basten as the strongest player he ever faced in 2018, commenting: &quot;The best player of all time for me [...] is Maradona, but the strongest player I ever faced was [V]an Basten because at least I could beat Maradona to the ball with my head.&quot;

In 2017, two of Van Basten&#x27;s former Milan teammates, Demetrio Albertini and Marco Simone, labelled the Dutchman as the best player they had ever played with, with the former stating, &quot;The best player I have ever played with is Van Basten, the best overall. He had elegance and strength. He stopped playing at only 28 years of age, which is truly young.&quot; That same year, another one of his fellow former Milan teammates, Paolo Maldini, labelled Van Basten as the most complete player with whom he had ever played. Another former Milan teammate of Van Basten, Giovanni Cornacchini, described the Dutch striker as the greatest player of all time in 2019. Former Milan Vice-Chairman and CEO Adriano Galliani instead described Van Basten as Milan&#x27;s greatest player ever in 2018. In 2017, Roberto Baggio named Van Basten as the player with whom he would have most liked to have played, commenting: &quot;I&#x27;d have liked to play with him. He&#x27;s the player that I exchanged shirts with most willingly.&quot;

In 2019, former Milan coach Fabio Capello described Van Basten and Ronaldo as the best players he ever coached. His predecessor at Milan, Arrigo Sacchi, described Van Basten as the best striker of all time in 2014, commenting: &quot;Marco van Basten remains for me the best striker of all time. No other forward has worked as hard for the team as Marco did at Milan. I above all remember him for his elegance, his grace and his incredible quality.&quot; When Hernán Crespo was asked in 2015 who was the greatest centre-forward of all time, he echoed Sacchi&#x27;s views, responding: &quot;Marco van Basten. He did everything: dribbling, shooting, headers, acrobatics. And he played with his team and for his team.&quot; In 2019, Antonio Cassano described Van Basten and Ronaldo as the best forwards in the history of the game.

==Managerial career==

===Jong Ajax===
Van Basten officially left Milan in 1995 and retired from football, stating he would never try management. However, he changed his mind and took a course with the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB). His first stint as a manager was as an assistant to his former teammate John van &#x27;t Schip with the second team of Ajax in 2003–04.

===Netherlands===
On 29 July 2004, Van Basten was named the new manager of the Netherlands national team, with Van &#x27;t Schip as his assistant. Van Basten&#x27;s appointment as manager of the Netherlands sparked a little controversy at the time, since he only just started his managerial career and the media argued that he did not have a lot of experience yet.
After UEFA Euro 2004, veterans Frank de Boer and Jaap Stam retired from international football, while Michael Reiziger retired after being left out of Van Basten&#x27;s first squad. Van Basten also omitted Ruud van Nistelrooy from that squad, as the striker was suspended for the first two games of 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification and Van Basten only wanted to use players eligible for those games. His debut on 18 August was a 2–2 draw away to Sweden. Van Basten dropped more experienced players such as Roy Makaay, Clarence Seedorf, Patrick Kluivert and Edgar Davids, while sending several inexperienced AZ players to the World Cup, including Joris Mathijsen, Denny Landzaat and Kew Jaliens. Several veterans, including Edwin van der Sar, Phillip Cocu and Mark van Bommel, did make the squad. His team went unbeaten in their first 16 games until losing a friendly 3–1 at home to Italy on 12 November 2005.

The Netherlands were widely tipped to do well at the 2006 World Cup, having achieved the highest points average of any team in qualification, as well as breaking their reputation for in-fighting, and having a short journey to the finals in Germany. The team were in Group C, considered the Group of death by international media for also containing Argentina, Ivory Coast and Serbia &amp; Montenegro, the last of whom conceded only one goal in qualification. The Netherlands were eliminated in a 1–0 loss to Portugal in the Round of 16, with both teams receiving two red cards each.
In November 2006, Van Basten recalled Seedorf for a friendly against England at the Amsterdam Arena. He denied allegations that he had caved in to media pressure to name Seedorf in place of the injured Wesley Sneijder. In May 2007, Van Basten announced the end of his long-running dispute with Van Nistelrooy, who had previously declared never to play for a Dutch national squad with Van Basten as its manager.

Van Basten had a contract with the KNVB for managing the Dutch national side until 2008. The KNVB had expressed its wishes to extend his contract to include the World Cup qualification route to 2010 World Cup in South Africa. On 22 February 2008, Van Basten signed a four-year contract with Ajax, starting from 1 July. His UEFA Euro 2008 selection was marred by Seedorf refusing to join the 30-man provisional squad unless Van Basten resigned, with Van Bommel having already made the same ultimatum.

At the tournament in Austria and Switzerland, the Netherlands beat world champions Italy 3–0 in their first match, followed by a 4–1 win over World Cup runners-up France. In their third match, having already qualified for the next round, Van Basten selected non-regulars such as Maarten Stekelenburg, Wilfred Bouma and Ibrahim Afellay for the starting lineup against Romania, a match the &quot;Oranje&quot; won 2–0. In the quarter-finals, Van Basten faced fellow Dutchman Guus Hiddink&#x27;s Russia. With the score at 1–1 after 90 minutes, Hiddink and Russia went on to win the match 3–1 in extra-time. He finished his reign with a record of 35 wins, 11 draws and six losses in 52 matches.

===Return to Ajax===
Van Basten became manager of Ajax after Euro 2008 but resigned on 6 May 2009 after his team failed to qualify for the Champions League. Van Basten started the season well, having spent millions on players such as Miralem Sulejmani, Ismaïl Aissati, Darío Cvitanich, Evander Sno, Eyong Enoh and Oleguer. However, in the second half of the season, striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar left for Real Madrid, and Van Basten started switching around his lineups. When Ajax lost 11 points in four matches, the Eredivisie title was out of sight. However, Ajax still had the chance to finish in second place, which would have ensured a place in the third qualifying round of the Champions League. Two important losses against PSV (6–2) and Sparta Rotterdam (4–0), however, ensured that Van Basten&#x27;s Ajax could only finish third in the league. Van Basten decided to resign as Ajax manager at the end of the 2008–09 season. Van Basten subsequently became a pundit for Sport1, but was still planning to return as a manager. He finished his reign with a record of 26 wins, 8 draws and 11 losses in 45 matches.

===Heerenveen===
On 13 February 2012, it was announced that Van Basten would become the manager of Eredivisie club Heerenveen in the 2012–13 season. Van Basten led Heerenveen to an eighth-place finish in the 2012–13 year campaign. He then led them to a fifth-place finish the following season, during the 2013–14 campaign. He finished his reign with a record of 27 wins, 18 draws and 27 losses in 72 matches.

===AZ===
AZ Alkmaar announced on 18 April 2014 that Van Basten would replace Dick Advocaat at the start of the 2014–15 season. On 28 August 2014, Van Basten took a leave of absence for the following match against Dordrecht, with multiple Dutch news outlets reporting he was suffering of stress-related heart palpitations, and was replaced by assistant coaches Alex Pastoor and Dennis Haar. Later, on 3 September, AZ confirmed that Van Basten was given an extended leave of absence until 14 September. On 16 September 2014, parties agreed Van Basten would relinquish his role as manager in order to sign a new contract as assistant coach until 2016; this was motivated by Van Basten himself, who stated the stress caused by his full-time role as head coach was causing him physical and mental issues. He finished his stint with two wins and three losses in five matches.

===FIFA technical director===
After a year at AZ, Van Basten decided to take up the vacant post of assistant coach under the new head coach of the Netherlands national team, Danny Blind. Van Basten would work together with fellow assistant coach Ruud van Nistelrooy, whom Van Basten had initially sent away when he was head coach of the Netherlands. In August 2016, Van Basten announced he would be leaving the role to take up a position at FIFA as technical director.

In March 2018, Van Basten travelled to Iran with FIFA president Gianni Infantino to mark 100 years of the Iran Football Federation. After meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani they were welcomed by the president of Iranian Football Federation Mehdi Taj at the Tehran Olympic Hotel. Attending the Tehran Derby, Van Basten called for the ban on women entering sports venues to be lifted.

==After retirement==

Van Basten played in the Demetrio Albertini testimonial match at the San Siro in March 2006, and headed in a goal before being substituted early in the first half. On 22 July 2006, he also returned for the testimonial match to celebrate the 11-year Arsenal career of Dennis Bergkamp, in what was the first match played at the new Emirates Stadium. He played in the second half for the Ajax legends team. He entered the match as part of a double substitution that also introduced Johan Cruyff. He took part in Tyskie&#x27;s (a Polish beer company) advertising campaign with Luís Figo and Zbigniew Boniek.

==Media and sponsorship==
Van Basten features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series, and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 14&quot;. Throughout his playing career, Van Basten was sponsored by Italian sportswear company Diadora. One of the most marketable players in the world, in the late 1980s Diadora launched his own personalized football boots, the San Siro Van Basten, earning him two million dollars over 5 years.

After his retirement from coaching, Van Basten became an analyst, and was described by ESPN in 2016 as a &quot;rather cerebral&quot; analyst who &quot;ponders the problems of FIFA and suggests changes to the offside rule.&quot; On 23 November 2019, while Van Basten was working as an analyst for the Dutch edition of the Fox Sports network, he said &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; (meaning &quot;Hail victory&quot; in German), a verbal salutation associated with the Nazi salute, during a live broadcast. Van Basten stated that he believed his microphone was off when he made the remark, and that it was in response to his colleague Hans Kraay&#x27;s interview with Heracles&#x27;s German manager, Frank Wormuth, following the team&#x27;s 4–1 loss to Ajax. Van Basten said: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my intention to shock people, I apologise. I just wanted to make a comment about Hans&#x27; German. It was an ill-placed joke.&quot; His use of the term attracted particular controversy as it occurred on a weekend during which Dutch football clubs were observing a minute of silence prior to matches in protest against discrimination. Following the incident, the network described Van Basten&#x27;s comment as &quot;stupid and inappropriate,&quot; and suspended him until 7 December. Electronic Arts also announced that Van Basten&#x27;s cards in FIFA Ultimate Team would no longer be available in FIFA 20 stating the company has &quot;an expectation that our commitment to quality and diversity is upheld.&quot; However he has returned to FIFA 21.

<text>Plantago is a genus of about 200 species of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae, commonly called plantains or fleaworts. The common name plantain is shared with the unrelated cooking plantain. Most are herbaceous plants, though a few are subshrubs growing to tall.

==Description==
The leaves are sessile or have a poorly defined petiole. They have three or five parallel veins that diverge in the wider part of the leaf. Leaves are broad or narrow, depending on the species. The inflorescences are borne on stalks typically tall, and can be a short cone or a long spike, with numerous tiny wind-pollinated flowers.

==Species==
The boundaries of the genus &quot;Plantago&quot; have been fairly stable, with the main question being whether to include &quot;Bougueria&quot; (one species from the Andes) and &quot;Littorella&quot; (2–3 species of aquatic plants).

There are about 200 species of &quot;Plantago&quot;, including:

=== Etymology ===
The genus name &quot;Plantago&quot; descends from the classical Latin name , which in classical Latin meant some &quot;Plantago&quot; species, including &quot;Plantago major&quot; and &quot;Plantago media&quot;. In Latin the name was formed from the classical Latin word = &quot;sole of the foot&quot;. The name was so formed in Latin because the leaves of these species grow out near flat at ground level. The suffix in Latin means &quot;a sort of&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species are found all over the world, including the Americas, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa and Europe. Many species in the genus are cosmopolitan weeds. They are found in many different habitats, most commonly in wet areas like seepages or bogs. They can also be found in alpine and semi-alpine or coastal areas. The cosmopolitan weeds can be frequently seen at the side of roads.

== Ecology ==
Plantains are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth).

==Uses==
Plantain has been consumed as human food since prehistory. For example, archaeological recovery along California&#x27;s Central Coast has demonstrated use of this species as a food since the Millingstone Horizon. The broad-leaved varieties are sometimes used as a leaf vegetable for salads, green sauce, and so on. Tender young plantain leaves can be eaten raw and older leaves can be cooked. The seeds can be cooked like rice.

&quot;Plantago&quot; species have been used since prehistoric times as herbal remedies. The herb is astringent, anti-toxic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-histamine, as well as demulcent, expectorant, styptic and diuretic. Externally, a poultice of the leaves is useful for insect bites, poison-ivy rashes, minor sores, and boils. In folklore it is even claimed to be able to cure snakebite and was used by the Dakota Indian tribe of North America for this. Internally, it is used for coughs and bronchitis, as a tea, tincture, or syrup. Tea made from the leaves may help cure diarrhea.

Plantain seed husks expand and become mucilaginous when wet, especially those of &quot;P. psyllium&quot;, which is used in common over-the-counter bulk laxative and fiber supplement products such as Metamucil. &quot;P. psyllium&quot; seed is useful for constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, dietary fiber supplementation, and diverticular disease. Mucilage from desert indianwheat (&quot;P. ovata&quot;) is obtained by grinding off the husk. This mucilage, also known as psyllium, is commonly sold as Isabgol, a laxative which is used to control irregular bowel syndrome and constipation. It has been used as an indigenous Ayurvedic and Unani medicine for a whole range of bowel problems. Psyllium supplements are typically used in powder form, along with adequate amounts of fluids. A dose of at least 7 grams daily taken with adequate amounts of fluid (water, juice) is used by some for management of elevated cholesterol. There are a number of psyllium products used for constipation. The usual dose is about 3.5 grams twice a day. Psyllium is also a component of several ready-to-eat cereals.

In Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia, leaves from &quot;Plantago major&quot; are used as a folk remedy to preventing infection on cuts and scratches because of its antiseptic properties. In Slovenia and other Central European regions, the leaves were traditionally used topically as a cure for blisters resulting from friction (such as caused by tight shoes etc.).

There may also be a use for plantains in the abatement of enteric methane from ruminants, as the natural compounds present (e.g. condensed tannins; ~14 g/kg DM), affect the acetate-propionate ratio in the rumen, which is a primary mechanism by which methanogenesis is restricted. Currently this is not a viable option in any significant scale due to agronomic difficulties.

==Culture==
As Old English &quot;Wegbrade&quot; the plantago is one of the nine plants invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon &quot;Nine Herbs Charm&quot;, recorded in the 10th century.

<text>A tercet is composed of three lines of poetry, forming a stanza or a complete poem.

==Examples of tercet forms==

English-language haiku is an example of an unrhymed tercet poem. A poetic triplet is a tercet in which all three lines follow the same rhyme, AAA; triplets are rather rare; they are more customarily used sparingly in verse of heroic couplets or other couplet verse, to add extraordinary emphasis.

Other types of tercet include an enclosed tercet where the lines rhyme in an ABA pattern and terza rima where the ABA pattern of a verse is continued in the next verse by making the outer lines of the next stanza rhyme with the central line of the preceding stanza, BCB, as in the &quot;terza rima&quot; or &quot;terzina&quot; form of Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. There has been much investigation of the possible sources of the Dantesque &quot;terzina&quot;, which Benedetto Croce characterised as &quot;linked, enclosed, disciplined, vehement and yet calm&quot;. William Baer observes of the tercets of terza rima, &quot;These interlocking rhymes tend to pull the listener&#x27;s attention forward in a continuous flow... Given this natural tendency to glide forward, terza rima is especially well-suited to narration and description&quot;.

The tercet also forms part of the villanelle, where the initial five stanzas are tercets, followed by a concluding quatrain.

A tercet may also form the separate halves of the ending sestet in a Petrarchan sonnet, where the rhyme scheme is ABBAABBACDCCDC, as in Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Cross of Snow&quot;. For example, while &quot;Cross of Snow&quot; is indeed a Petrarchan sonnet, it does not follow the form of ABBA, ABBA CDC, CDC. Instead, its form is ABBA CDDC EFG EFG. A tercet also ends sestinas where the keywords of the lines before are repeated in a highly ordered form.

==History==
Tercets (or &quot;&quot;) using parallelism appear in Biblical Hebrew poetry.

The tercet was introduced into English poetry by Sir Thomas Wyatt in the 16th century. It was employed by Shelley and is the form used in Byron&#x27;s &quot;The Prophecy of Dante&quot;.

<doc id="51760" wikidata="Q16483" url="?curid=51760" title="Graves' disease">
<text>Graves&#x27; disease, also known as toxic diffuse goiter or Basedow’s disease, is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid. It frequently results in and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It also often results in an enlarged thyroid. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, poor tolerance of heat, diarrhea and unintentional weight loss. Other symptoms may include thickening of the skin on the shins, known as pretibial myxedema, and eye bulging, a condition caused by Graves&#x27; ophthalmopathy. About 25 to 30% of people with the condition develop eye problems.

The exact cause of the disease is unclear, but symptoms are a result of antibodies binding to receptors on the thyroid causing over-expression of thyroid hormone. Persons are more likely to be affected if they have a family member with the disease. If one monozygotic twin is affected, a 30% chance exists that the other twin will also have the disease. The onset of disease may be triggered by physical or emotional stress, infection, or giving birth. Those with other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, are more likely to be affected. Smoking increases the risk of disease and may worsen eye problems. The disorder results from an antibody, called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), that has a similar effect to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). These TSI antibodies cause the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormones. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with blood tests and radioiodine uptake. Typically, blood tests show a raised T3 and T4, low TSH, increased radioiodine uptake in all areas of the thyroid, and TSI antibodies.
The three treatment options are radioiodine therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy involves taking iodine-131 by mouth, which is then concentrated in the thyroid and destroys it over weeks to months. The resulting hypothyroidism is treated with synthetic thyroid hormones. Medications such as beta blockers may control some of the symptoms, and antithyroid medications such as methimazole may temporarily help people, while other treatments are having effect. Surgery to remove the thyroid is another option. Eye problems may require additional treatments.
Graves disease develops in about 0.5% of males and 3.0% of females. It occurs about 7.5 times more often in women than in men. Often, it starts between the ages of 40 and 60, but can begin at any age. It is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States (about 50 to 80% of cases). The condition is named after Irish surgeon Robert Graves, who described it in 1835. A number of prior descriptions also exist.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of Graves disease virtually all result from the direct and indirect effects of hyperthyroidism, with main exceptions being Graves ophthalmopathy, goiter, and pretibial myxedema (which are caused by the autoimmune processes of the disease). Symptoms of the resultant hyperthyroidism are mainly insomnia, hand tremor, hyperactivity, hair loss, excessive sweating, oligomenorrhea, itching, heat intolerance, weight loss despite increased appetite, diarrhea, frequent defecation, palpitations, periodic partial muscle weakness or paralysis in those especially of Asian descent, and skin warmth and moistness. Further signs that may be seen on physical examination are most commonly a diffusely enlarged (usually symmetric), nontender thyroid, lid lag, excessive lacrimation due to Graves&#x27; ophthalmopathy, arrhythmias of the heart, such as sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions, and hypertension.

==Cause==
The exact cause is unclear, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While a theoretical mechanism occurs by which exposure to severe stressors and high levels of subsequent distress such as post-traumatic stress disorder could increase the risk of immune disease and cause an aggravation of the autoimmune response that leads to Graves disease, more robust clinical data are needed for a firm conclusion.

===Genetics===
A genetic predisposition for Graves&#x27; disease is seen, with some people more prone to develop TSH receptor-activating antibodies due to a genetic cause. Human leukocyte antigen DR (especially DR3) appears to play a role. To date, no clear genetic defect has been found to point to a single-gene cause.

Genes believed to be involved include those for thyroglobulin, thyrotropin receptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (&quot;PTPN22&quot;), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4, among others.

===Infectious trigger===
Since Graves disease is an autoimmune disease that appears suddenly, often later in life, a viral or bacterial infection may trigger antibodies, which cross-react with the human TSH receptor, a phenomenon known as antigenic mimicry.

The bacterium &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot; bears structural similarity with the human thyrotropin receptor and was hypothesized to contribute to the development of thyroid autoimmunity arising for other reasons in genetically susceptible individuals.
In the 1990s, &quot;Y. enterocolitica&quot; was suggested to be possibly associated with Graves&#x27; disease.
More recently, the role for &quot;Y. enterocolitica&quot; has been disputed.

Epstein–Barr virus is another potential trigger.

==Mechanism==
Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins recognize and bind to the TSH receptor, which stimulates the secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroxine receptors in the pituitary gland are activated by the surplus hormone, suppressing additional release of TSH in a negative feedback loop. The result is very high levels of circulating thyroid hormones and a low TSH level.

===Pathophysiology===

Graves&#x27; disease is an autoimmune disorder, in which the body produces antibodies that are specific to a self-protein - the receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone. (Antibodies to thyroglobulin and to the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 may also be produced.)

These antibodies cause hyperthyroidism because they bind to the TSHr and chronically stimulate it. The TSHr is expressed on the thyroid follicular cells of the thyroid gland (the cells that produce thyroid hormone), and the result of chronic stimulation is an abnormally high production of T3 and T4. This, in turn, causes the clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and the enlargement of the thyroid gland visible as goiter.

The infiltrative exophthalmos frequently encountered has been explained by postulating that the thyroid gland and the extraocular muscles share a common antigen, which is recognized by the antibodies. Antibodies binding to the extraocular muscles would cause swelling behind the eyeball.

The &quot;orange peel&quot; skin has been explained by the infiltration of antibodies under the skin, causing an inflammatory reaction and subsequent fibrous plaques.

The three types of autoantibodies to the TSH receptor are:

# Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins: these antibodies (mainly IgG) act as long-acting thyroid stimulants, activating the cells through a slower and more drawn out process compared to TSH, leading to an elevated production of thyroid hormone.
# Thyroid growth immunoglobulins: these antibodies bind directly to the TSH receptor and have been implicated in the growth of thyroid follicles.
# Thyrotrophin binding-inhibiting immunoglobulins: these antibodies inhibit the normal union of TSH with its receptor.
#* Some actually act as if TSH itself is binding to its receptor, thus inducing thyroid function.
#* Other types may not stimulate the thyroid gland, but prevent TSI and TSH from binding to and stimulating the receptor.
Another effect of hyperthyroidism is bone loss from osteoporosis, caused by an increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus in the urine and stool. The effects can be minimized if the hyperthyroidism is treated early. Thyrotoxicosis can also augment calcium levels in the blood by as much as 25%. This can cause stomach upset, excessive urination, and impaired kidney function.

==Diagnosis==
Graves disease may present clinically with one or more of these characteristic signs:
* Rapid heartbeat (80%)
* Diffuse palpable goiter with audible bruit (70%)
* Tremor (40%)
* Exophthalmos (protuberance of one or both eyes), periorbital edema (25%)
* Fatigue (70%), weight loss (60%) with increased appetite in young people and poor appetite in the elderly, and other symptoms of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis
* Heat intolerance (55%)
* Tremulousness (55%)
* Palpitations (50%)

Two signs are truly diagnostic of Graves&#x27; disease (i.e., not seen in other hyperthyroid conditions): exophthalmos and non-pitting edema (pretibial myxedema). Goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland and is of the diffuse type (i.e., spread throughout the gland). Diffuse goiter may be seen with other causes of hyperthyroidism, although Graves&#x27; disease is the most common cause of diffuse goiter. A large goiter will be visible to the naked eye, but a small one (mild enlargement of the gland) may be detectable only by physical examination. Occasionally, goiter is not clinically detectable, but may be seen only with computed tomography or ultrasound examination of the thyroid. Another sign of Graves&#x27; disease is hyperthyroidism, that is, overproduction of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Normal thyroid levels are also seen, and occasionally also hypothyroidism, which may assist in causing goiter (though it is not the cause of the Graves&#x27; disease). Hyperthyroidism in Graves&#x27; disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of hyperthyroidism, by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4.

Other useful laboratory measurements in Graves disease include thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, usually undetectable in Graves disease due to negative feedback from the elevated T3 and T4), and protein-bound iodine (elevated). Serologically detected thyroid-stimulating antibodies, radioactive iodine uptake, or thyroid ultrasound with Doppler all can independently confirm a diagnosis of Graves disease.

Biopsy to obtain histiological testing is not normally required, but may be obtained if thyroidectomy is performed.

The goiter in Graves disease is often not nodular, but thyroid nodules are also common. Differentiating common forms of hyperthyroidism such as Graves&#x27; disease, single thyroid adenoma, and toxic multinodular goiter is important to determine proper treatment. The differentiation among these entities has advanced, as imaging and biochemical tests have improved. Measuring TSH-receptor antibodies with the h-TBII assay has been proven efficient and was the most practical approach found in one study.

===Eye disease===

Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), or thyroid eye disease (TED), is the most common extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves&#x27; disease. It is a form of idiopathic lymphocytic orbital inflammation, and although its pathogenesis is not completely understood, autoimmune activation of orbital fibroblasts, which in TAO express the TSH receptor, is thought to play a central role.

Hypertrophy of the extraocular muscles, adipogenesis, and deposition of nonsulfated glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronate, causes expansion of the orbital fat and muscle compartments, which within the confines of the bony orbit may lead to dysthyroid optic neuropathy, increased intraocular pressures, proptosis, venous congestion leading to chemosis and periorbital edema, and progressive remodeling of the orbital walls. Other distinctive features of TAO include lid retraction, restrictive myopathy, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, and exposure keratopathy.

Severity of eye disease may be classified by the mnemonic: &quot;NO SPECS&quot;:
* Class 0: No signs or symptoms
* Class 1: Only signs (limited to upper lid retraction and stare, with or without lid lag)
* Class 2: Soft tissue involvement (oedema of conjunctivae and lids, conjunctival injection, etc.)
* Class 3: Proptosis
* Class 4: Extraocular muscle involvement (usually with diplopia)
* Class 5: Corneal involvement (primarily due to lagophthalmos)
* Class 6: Sight loss (due to optic nerve involvement)
Typically, the natural history of TAO follows Rundle&#x27;s curve, which describes a rapid worsening during an initial phase, up to a peak of maximum severity, and then improvement to a static plateau without, however, resolving back to a normal condition.

==Management==
Treatment of Graves disease includes antithyroid drugs that reduce the production of thyroid hormone, radioiodine (radioactive iodine I-131) and thyroidectomy (surgical excision of the gland). As operating on a hyperthyroid patient is dangerous, prior to thyroidectomy, preoperative treatment with antithyroid drugs is given to render the patient euthyroid. Each of these treatments has advantages and disadvantages, and no single treatment approach is considered the best for everyone.

Treatment with antithyroid medications must be administered for six months to two years to be effective. Even then, upon cessation of the drugs, the hyperthyroid state may recur. The risk of recurrence is about 40–50%, and lifelong treatment with antithyroid drugs carries some side effects such as agranulocytosis and liver disease. Side effects of the antithyroid medications include a potentially fatal reduction in the level of white blood cells. Therapy with radioiodine is the most common treatment in the United States, while antithyroid drugs and/or thyroidectomy are used more often in Europe, Japan, and most of the rest of the world.

β-Blockers (such as propranolol) may be used to inhibit the sympathetic nervous system symptoms of tachycardia and nausea until antithyroid treatments start to take effect. Pure β-blockers do not inhibit lid retraction in the eyes, which is mediated by alpha adrenergic receptors.

===Antithyroid drugs===
The main antithyroid drugs are carbimazole (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. These drugs block the binding of iodine and coupling of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU). Others include granulocytopenia (dose-dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia. Patients on these medications should see a doctor if they develop sore throat or fever. The most common side effects are rash and peripheral neuritis. These drugs also cross the placenta and are secreted in breast milk. Lugol&#x27;s iodine may be used to block hormone synthesis before surgery.

A randomized control trial testing single-dose treatment for Graves found methimazole achieved euthyroid state more effectively after 12 weeks than did propylthyouracil (77.1% on methimazole 15 mg vs 19.4% in the propylthiouracil 150 mg groups).

No difference in outcome was shown for adding thyroxine to antithyroid medication and continuing thyroxine versus placebo after antithyroid medication withdrawal. However, two markers were found that can help predict the risk of recurrence. These two markers are a positive TSHr antibody (TSHR-Ab) and smoking. A positive TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment increases the risk of recurrence to 90% (sensitivity 39%, specificity 98%), and a negative TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment is associated with a 78% chance of remaining in remission. Smoking was shown to have an impact independent to a positive TSHR-Ab.

===Radioiodine===

Radioiodine (radioactive iodine-131) was developed in the early 1940s at the Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center. This modality is suitable for most patients, although some prefer to use it mainly for older patients. Indications for radioiodine are failed medical therapy or surgery and where medical or surgical therapy are contraindicated. Hypothyroidism may be a complication of this therapy, but may be treated with thyroid hormones if it appears. The rationale for radioactive iodine is that it accumulates in the thyroid and irradiates the gland with its beta and gamma radiations, about 90% of the total radiation being emitted by the beta (electron) particles. The most common method of iodine-131 treatment is to administer a specified amount in microcuries per gram of thyroid gland based on palpation or radiodiagnostic imaging of the gland over 24 hours. Patients who receive the therapy must be monitored regularly with thyroid blood tests to ensure they are treated with thyroid hormone before they become symptomatically hypothyroid.

Contraindications to RAI are pregnancy (absolute), ophthalmopathy (relative; it can aggravate thyroid eye disease), or solitary nodules.

Disadvantages of this treatment are a high incidence of hypothyroidism (up to 80%) requiring eventual thyroid hormone supplementation in the form of a daily pill(s). The radioiodine treatment acts slowly (over months to years) to destroy the thyroid gland, and Graves&#x27; disease–associated hyperthyroidism is not cured in all persons by radioiodine, but has a relapse rate that depends on the dose of radioiodine which is administered. In rare cases, radiation induced thyroiditis has been linked to this treatment.

===Surgery===

This modality is suitable for young people and pregnant females. Indications for thyroidectomy can be separated into absolute indications or relative indications. These indications aid in deciding which people would benefit most from surgery. The absolute indications are a large goiter (especially when compressing the trachea), suspicious nodules or suspected cancer (to pathologically examine the thyroid), and people with ophthalmopathy and additionally if it is the person&#x27;s preferred method of treatment or if refusing to undergo radioactive iodine treatment. Pregnancy is advised to be delayed for six months after radioactive iodine treatment.

Both bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy and the Hartley-Dunhill procedure (hemithyroidectomy on one side and partial lobectomy on other side) are possible.

Advantages are immediate cure and potential removal of carcinoma. Its risks are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, hypoparathyroidism (due to removal of the parathyroid glands), hematoma (which can be life-threatening if it compresses the trachea), relapse following medical treatment, infections (less common), and scarring. The increase in the risk of nerve injury can be due to the increased vascularity of the thyroid parenchyma and the development of links between the thyroid capsule and the surrounding tissues. Reportedly, a 1% incidence exists of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis after complete thyroidectomy. Risks related to anesthesia are many, thus coordination with the anesthesiologist and patient optimization for surgery preoperatively are essential. Removal of the gland enables complete biopsy to be performed to have definite evidence of cancer anywhere in the thyroid. (Needle biopsies are not so accurate at predicting a benign state of the thyroid). No further treatment of the thyroid is required, unless cancer is detected. Radioiodine uptake study may be done after surgery, to ensure all remaining (potentially cancerous) thyroid cells (i.e., near the nerves to the vocal cords) are destroyed. Besides this, the only remaining treatment will be levothyroxine, or thyroid replacement pills to be taken for the rest of the patient&#x27;s life.

A 2013 review article concludes that surgery appears to be the most successful in the management of Graves&#x27; disease, with total thyroidectomy being the preferred surgical option.

===Eyes===
Mild cases are treated with lubricant eye drops or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drops. Severe cases threatening vision (corneal exposure or optic nerve compression) are treated with steroids or orbital decompression. In all cases, cessation of smoking is essential. Double vision can be corrected with prism glasses and surgery (the latter only when the process has been stable for a while).

Difficulty closing eyes can be treated with lubricant gel at night, or with tape on the eyes to enable full, deep sleep.

Orbital decompression can be performed to enable bulging eyes to retreat back into the head. Bone is removed from the skull behind the eyes, and space is made for the muscles and fatty tissue to fall back into the skull. 

For management of clinically active Graves disease, orbitopathy (clinical activity score &gt;2) with at least mild to moderate severity, intravenous glucocorticoids are the treatment of choice, usually administered in the form of pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. Studies have consistently shown that pulse intravenous methylprednisolone is superior to oral glucocorticoids both in terms of efficacy and decreased side effects for managing Graves&#x27; orbitopathy.

==Prognosis==
If left untreated, more serious complications could result, including birth defects in pregnancy, increased risk of a miscarriage, bone mineral loss and, in extreme cases, death (e.g. indirectly through complications, or through a thyroid storm event). Graves&#x27; disease is often accompanied by an increase in heart rate, which may lead to further heart complications, including loss of the normal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), which may lead to stroke. If the eyes are proptotic (bulging) enough that the lids do not close completely at night, dryness will occur – with the risk of a secondary corneal infection, which could lead to blindness. Pressure on the optic nerve behind the globe can lead to visual field defects and vision loss, as well. Prolonged untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss, which may resolve when treated.

==Epidemiology==

Graves&#x27; disease occurs in about 0.5% of people. Graves&#x27; disease data has shown that the lifetime risk for women is around 3% and 0.5% for men. It occurs about 7.5 times more often in women than in men and often starts between the ages of 40 and 60. It is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States (about 50 to 80% of cases).

==History==
Graves disease owes its name to the Anglo-Irish doctor Robert James Graves, who described a case of goiter with exophthalmos in 1835. (Medical eponyms are often styled nonpossessively; thus &quot;Graves&#x27; disease&quot; and &quot;Graves disease&quot; are variant stylings of the same term.)

The German Karl Adolph von Basedow independently reported the same constellation of symptoms in 1840. As a result, on the European continent, the terms &quot;Basedow syndrome&quot;, &quot;Basedow disease&quot;, or &quot;Morbus Basedow&quot; are more common than &quot;Graves&#x27; disease&quot;.

Graves disease has also been called &quot;exophthalmic goiter&quot;.

Less commonly, it has been known as Parry disease, Begbie disease, Flajan disease, Flajani–Basedow syndrome, and Marsh disease. These names for the disease were derived from Caleb Hillier Parry, James Begbie, Giuseppe Flajani, and Henry Marsh. Early reports, not widely circulated, of cases of goiter with exophthalmos were published by the Italians Giuseppe Flajani and Antonio Giuseppe Testa, in 1802 and 1810, respectively. Prior to these, Caleb Hillier Parry, a notable provincial physician in England of the late 18th century (and a friend of Edward Miller-Gallus), described a case in 1786. This case was not published until 1825 - ten years ahead of Graves.

However, fair credit for the first description of Graves disease goes to the 12th-century Persian physician Sayyid Ismail al-Jurjani, who noted the association of goiter and exophthalmos in his &quot;Thesaurus of the Shah of Khwarazm&quot;, the major medical dictionary of its time.

==Society and culture==
=== Notable cases ===
* Ayaka, Japanese singer, was diagnosed with Graves disease in 2007. After going public with her diagnosis in 2009, she took a two-year hiatus from music to focus on treatment.
* Susan Elizabeth Blow, American educator and founder of the first publicly funded kindergarten in the United States, was forced to retire and seek treatment for Graves disease in 1884.
* George H. W. Bush, former U.S. president, developed new atrial fibrillation and was diagnosed in 1991 with hyperthyroidism due to the disease and treated with radioactive iodine. The president&#x27;s wife, Barbara Bush, also developed the disease around the same time, which, in her case, produced severe infiltrative exophthalmos.
* Rodney Dangerfield, American comedian and actor
* Gail Devers, American sprinter: A doctor considered amputating her feet after she developed blistering and swelling following radiation treatment for Graves&#x27; disease, but she went on to recover and win Olympic medals.
* Missy Elliott, American hip-hop artist
* Marty Feldman, British comedy writer, comedian and actor
* Sia, Australian singer and songwriter
* Sammy Gravano, Italian-American former underboss of the Gambino crime family
* Jim Hamilton, Scottish rugby player, discovered he had Graves&#x27; disease shortly after retiring from the sport in 2017.

* Wendy Williams, American TV show host
* Act Yasukawa, Japanese professional wrestler
=== Literature ===

* Ern Malley was an acclaimed Australian poet whose work was not published until after his death from Graves&#x27; disease in 1943. However, Malley&#x27;s existence and entire biography was actually later revealed to be a literary hoax.

==Research==
Agents that act as antagonists at thyroid stimulating hormone receptors are under investigation as a possible treatment for Graves&#x27; disease.

<doc id="51761" wikidata="Q2611" url="?curid=51761" title="Elias gamma coding">
<text>Elias formula_1 code or Elias gamma code is a universal code encoding positive integers developed by Peter Elias. It is used most commonly when coding integers whose upper-bound cannot be determined beforehand.

==Encoding==

To code a number &quot;x&quot; ≥ 1:
# Let formula_2 be the highest power of 2 it contains, so 2&quot;N&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; 2&quot;N&quot;+1.
# Write out formula_3 zero bits, then
# Append the binary form of formula_4, an formula_5-bit binary number.

An equivalent way to express the same process:
# Encode formula_3 in unary; that is, as formula_3 zeroes followed by a one.
# Append the remaining formula_3 binary digits of formula_4 to this representation of formula_3.

To represent a number formula_4, Elias gamma (γ) uses formula_12 bits.

The code begins (the implied probability distribution for the code is added for clarity):

==Decoding==
To decode an Elias gamma-coded integer:
#Read and count 0s from the stream until you reach the first 1. Call this count of zeroes &quot;N&quot;.
#Considering the one that was reached to be the first digit of the integer, with a value of 2&quot;N&quot;, read the remaining &quot;N&quot; digits of the integer.

==Uses==
Gamma coding is used in applications where the largest encoded value is not known ahead of time, or to compress data in which small values are much more frequent than large values.

Gamma coding can be more size efficient in those situations. For example, note that, in the table above, if a fixed 8-bit size is chosen to store a small number like the number 5, the resulting binary would be codice_1, while the γ-encoding variable-bit version would be codice_2, needing 3 bits less. On the contrary, bigger values, like 254 stored in fixed 8-bit size, would be codice_3 while the γ-encoding variable-bit version would be codice_4, needing 7 extra bits.

Gamma coding is a building block in the Elias delta code.

== Generalizations ==

Gamma coding does not code zero or negative integers.
One way of handling zero is to add 1 before coding and then subtract 1 after decoding.
Another way is to prefix each nonzero code with a 1 and then code zero as a single 0.

One way to code all integers is to set up a bijection, mapping integers (0, −1, 1, −2, 2, −3, 3, ...) to (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...) before coding. In software, this is most easily done by mapping non-negative inputs to odd outputs, and negative inputs to even outputs, so the least-significant bit becomes an inverted sign bit:
formula_13

Exponential-Golomb coding generalizes the gamma code to integers with a &quot;flatter&quot; power-law distribution, just as Golomb coding generalizes the unary code.
It involves dividing the number by a positive divisor, commonly a power of 2, writing the gamma code for one more than the quotient, and writing out the remainder in an ordinary binary code.

<doc id="51763" wikidata="Q23157" url="?curid=51763" title="Somerset">
<text>Somerset ( , ), archaically Somersetshire ( , , ) is a ceremonial county in South West England. It is bordered by the Bristol Channel, Gloucestershire, and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east, and Devon to the south-west. The largest settlement is the city of Bath, and the county town is Taunton.

Somerset is a predominantly rural county, especially to the south and west, with an area of and a population of 965,424. After Bath (101,557), the largest settlements are Weston-super-Mare (82,418), Taunton (60,479), and Yeovil (49,698). Wells (12,000) is a city, the second-smallest by population in England. For local government purposes the county comprises three unitary authority areas: Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset, and Somerset. Bath and North East Somerset Council is a member of the West of England Combined Authority.

The centre of Somerset is dominated by the Levels, a coastal plain and wetland. The north-east contains part of the Cotswolds uplands and all of the Mendip Hills, which are both national landscapes; the west contains the Quantock Hills and part of the Blackdown Hills, which are also national landscapes, and most of Exmoor, a national park. The major rivers of the county are the Avon, which flows through Bath and then Bristol, and the Axe, Brue, and Parrett, which drain the Levels.

There is evidence of Paleolithic human occupation in Somerset, and the area was subsequently settled by the Celts, Romans and Anglo-Saxons. The county played a significant part in Alfred the Great&#x27;s rise to power, and later the English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion. In the later medieval period its wealth allowed its monasteries and parish churches to be rebuilt in grand style; Glastonbury Abbey was particularly important, and claimed to house the tomb of King Arthur and Guinevere. The city of Bath is famous for its Georgian architecture, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The county is also the location of Glastonbury Festival, one of the UK&#x27;s major music festivals.

==Toponymy==
Somerset&#x27;s name derives from Old English , short for , meaning &quot;the people living at or dependent on Sumortūn (Somerton)&quot;. The first known use of &quot;Somersæte&quot; is in the law code of King Ine who was the Saxon King of Wessex from 688 to 726 CE, making Somerset along with Hampshire, Wiltshire and Dorset one of the oldest extant units of local government in the world. An alternative suggestion is the name derives from &quot;Seo-mere-saetan&quot; meaning &quot;settlers by the sea lakes&quot;. The same ending can also be seen in the neighbouring Dorset.

The Old English name is used in the motto of the county, , meaning &quot;all the people of Somerset&quot;. Adopted as the motto in 1911, the phrase is taken from the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Somerset was a shire of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and the phrase refers to the wholehearted support the people of Somerset gave to King Alfred in his struggle to save Wessex from Viking invaders.

Somerset settlement names are mostly Anglo-Saxon in origin (for example, Bath, Somerton, Wells and Keynsham), but numerous place names include British Celtic elements, such as the rivers Frome and Avon, and names of hills. For example, an Anglo-Saxon charter of 682 refers to Creechborough Hill as &quot;the hill which in the British language is &quot;Cructan&quot; and which to us is &quot;Crychbeorh&quot;&quot;. Some modern names are wholly Brittonic in origin, like Tarnock, Priddy, and Chard, while others have both Saxon and Brittonic elements, such as Pen Hill.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The caves of the Mendip Hills were settled during the Palaeolithic period, and contain extensive archaeological sites such as those at Cheddar Gorge. Bones from Gough&#x27;s Cave have been dated to 12,000 BCE, and a complete skeleton, known as Cheddar Man, dates from 7150 BCE. Examples of cave art have been found in Aveline&#x27;s Hole. Some caves continued to be occupied until modern times, including Wookey Hole.

The Somerset Levels—specifically dry points at Glastonbury and Brent Knoll—also have a long history of settlement, and are known to have been settled by Mesolithic hunters. Travel in the area was facilitated by the construction of one of the world&#x27;s oldest known engineered roadways, the Sweet Track, which dates from 3807 BCE or 3806 BCE.

The exact age of the henge monument at Stanton Drew stone circles is unknown, but it is believed to be Neolithic. There are numerous Iron Age hill forts, some of which, like Cadbury Castle and Ham Hill, were later reoccupied in the Early Middle Ages.

===Roman invasion===
On the authority of the future emperor Vespasian, as part of the ongoing expansion of the Roman presence in Britain, the Second Legion Augusta invaded Somerset from the south-east in 47 CE. The county remained part of the Roman Empire until around 409 CE, when the Roman occupation of Britain came to an end.
A variety of Roman remains have been found, including Pagans Hill Roman temple in Chew Stoke, Low Ham Roman Villa and the Roman Baths that gave their name to the city of Bath.

===Saxon and Norman invasions===

After the Romans left, Britain was invaded by Anglo-Saxon peoples. By 600 CE they had established control over much of what is now England, but Somerset was still in native British hands. The British held back Saxon advance into the south-west for some time longer, but by the early eighth century King Ine of Wessex had pushed the boundaries of the West Saxon kingdom far enough west to include Somerset. The Saxon royal palace in Cheddar was used several times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot.

The nature of the relations between the Britons and the Saxons in Somerset is not entirely clear. Ine&#x27;s laws demonstrate that the Britons were considered to be a significant enough population in Wessex to merit provisions; however, the laws also suggest that Britons could not attain the same social standing as the Saxons, and that many were slaves. In light of such policies, many Britons might have chosen to emigrate to places such as Brittany while those who remained would have had incentives to adopt Anglo-Saxon culture.

After the Norman Conquest, the county was divided into 700 fiefs, and large areas were owned by the crown, with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence. Somerset came under the political influence of several different nobles during the Middle Ages. During the Wars of the Roses, an important magnate was Humphrey Stafford, earl of Devon whose wider influence stretched from Cornwall to Wiltshire. After 1485, one of the county&#x27;s most influential figures was Henry VII&#x27;s chamberlain Giles Daubeney.

===The 17th–19th centuries===
Somerset contains HM Prison Shepton Mallet, which was England&#x27;s oldest prison still in use prior to its closure in 2013, having opened in 1610. During the English Civil War, Somerset was largely Parliamentarian, with key engagements being the Sieges of Taunton and the Battle of Langport.

In 1685, the Monmouth Rebellion was played out in Somerset and neighbouring Dorset. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and travelled north, hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, but they were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last pitched battle fought in England. Arthur Wellesley took his title, Duke of Wellington from the town of Wellington; he is commemorated on a nearby hill by a large, spotlit obelisk, known as the Wellington Monument.

The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelled the end for most of Somerset&#x27;s cottage industries. Farming continued to flourish, and the Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures and Commerce was founded in 1777 to improve farming methods. Despite this, two decades later agriculturist John Billingsley conducted a survey of the county&#x27;s agriculture in 1795 and found that agricultural methods could still be improved.

Coal mining was an important industry in north Somerset during the 18th and 19th centuries, and by 1800 it was prominent in Radstock.

The Somerset Coalfield reached its peak production by the 1920s. All the pits have now been closed, the last in 1973. Most of the surface buildings have been removed, and apart from a winding wheel outside Radstock Museum, little evidence of their former existence remains. Further west, the Brendon Hills were mined for iron ore in the late 19th century; this was taken by the West Somerset Mineral Railway to Watchet Harbour for shipment to the furnaces at Ebbw Vale.

===20th century===
Many Somerset soldiers died during the First World War, with the Somerset Light Infantry suffering nearly 5,000 casualties. War memorials were put up in most of the county&#x27;s towns and villages; only nine, described as the Thankful Villages, had none of their residents killed. During the Second World War the county was a base for troops preparing for the D-Day landings. Some of the hospitals which were built for the casualties of the war remain in use. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to repel a potential German invasion. The remains of its pill boxes can still be seen along the coast, and south through Ilminster and Chard.

A number of decoy towns were constructed in Somerset in World War II to protect Bristol and other towns. They were designed to mimic the nighttime geometry of &quot;blacked out&quot; streets, railway lines, and Bristol Temple Meads railway station, to encourage German bombers away from these targets. One, on the German radio navigation beam flight path to Bristol, was constructed on Beacon Batch. It was laid out by Shepperton Studios, based on aerial photographs of the city&#x27;s railway marshalling yards. The decoys were fitted with dim red lights, simulating activities such as the stoking of steam locomotives. Burning bales of straw soaked in creosote were used to simulate the effects of incendiary bombs dropped by the first wave of Pathfinder night bombers; meanwhile, incendiary bombs dropped on the correct location were quickly smothered, wherever possible. Drums of oil were also ignited to simulate the effect of a blazing city or town, with the aim of fooling subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs on the wrong location.

The Chew Magna decoy town was hit by half a dozen bombs on 2 December 1940, and over a thousand incendiaries on 3 January 1941. The following night the Uphill decoy town, protecting the airfield at Weston-super-Mare, was bombed; a herd of dairy cows was hit, killing some and severely injuring others.

==Geography==
===Boundaries===

The boundaries of Somerset are largely unaltered from medieval times. The main change has been in the north, where the River Avon formed the border with Gloucestershire, except that the hundred of Bath Forum, which straddles the Avon, formed part of Somerset. Bristol began as a town on the Gloucestershire side of the Avon, but as it grew it extended across the river into Somerset. In 1373 Edward III proclaimed &quot;that the town of Bristol with its suburbs and precincts shall henceforth be separate from the counties of Gloucester and Somerset ... and that it should be a county by itself&quot;.

The present-day northern border of Somerset (adjoining the counties of Bristol and Gloucestershire) runs along the southern bank of the Avon from the Bristol Channel, then follows around the southern edge of the Bristol built-up area, before continuing upstream along the Avon and then diverges from the river to include Bath and its historic hinterland to the north of the Avon, before meeting Wiltshire at the &quot;Three Shire Stones&quot; on the &quot;Fosse Way&quot; at Batheaston.

===Cities and towns===

Somerton took over from Ilchester as the county town in the late thirteenth century, but it declined in importance and the status of county town transferred to Taunton about 1366. The county has two cities, Bath and Wells, and 30 towns (including the county town of Taunton, which has no town council but instead is the chief settlement of the county&#x27;s only extant borough). The largest urban areas in terms of population are Bath, Weston-super-Mare, Taunton, Yeovil and Bridgwater.

Many settlements developed because of their strategic importance in relation to geographical features, such as river crossings or valleys in ranges of hills. Examples include Axbridge on the River Axe, Castle Cary on the River Cary, North Petherton on the River Parrett, and Ilminster, where there was a crossing point on the River Isle. Midsomer Norton lies on the River Somer; while the Wellow Brook and the &quot;Fosse Way&quot; Roman road run through Radstock. Chard is the most southerly town in Somerset and one of the highest, though at an altitude of Wiveliscombe is the highest town in the county.

=== Green belt ===

The county contains several-miles-wide sections of the Avon green belt area, which is primarily in place to prevent urban sprawl from the Bristol and Bath built up areas encroaching into the rural areas of North Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset, and Mendip districts in the county, as well as maintaining surrounding countryside. It stretches from the coastline between the towns of Portishead and Clevedon, extending eastwards past Nailsea, around the Bristol conurbation, and through to the city of Bath. The green belt border intersects with the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) along its south boundary, and meets the Cotswolds AONB by its eastern extent along the Wiltshire county border, creating an extended area protected from inappropriate development.

===Geology===

Much of the landscape of Somerset falls into types determined by the underlying geology. These landscapes are the limestone karst and lias of the north, the clay vales and wetlands of the centre, the oolites of the east and south, and the Devonian sandstone of the west.
To the north-east of the Somerset Levels, the Mendip Hills are moderately high limestone hills. The central and western Mendip Hills was designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1972 and covers . The main habitat on these hills is calcareous grassland, with some arable agriculture. To the south-west of the Somerset Levels are the Quantock Hills which was England&#x27;s first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty designated in 1956 which is covered in heathland, oak woodlands, ancient parklands with plantations of conifer and covers 99 square kilometres. The Somerset Coalfield is part of a larger coalfield which stretches into Gloucestershire. To the north of the Mendip hills is the Chew Valley and to the south, on the clay substrate, are broad valleys which support dairy farming and drain into the Somerset Levels.

===Caves and rivers===
There is an extensive network of caves, including Wookey Hole, underground rivers, and gorges, including the Cheddar Gorge and Ebbor Gorge. The county has many rivers, including the Axe, Brue, Cary, Parrett, Sheppey, Tone and Yeo. These both feed and drain the flat levels and moors of mid and west Somerset. In the north of the county the River Chew flows into the Bristol Avon. The Parrett is tidal almost to Langport, where there is evidence of two Roman wharfs. At the same site during the reign of King Charles I, river tolls were levied on boats to pay for the maintenance of the bridge.

===Levels and moors===

The Somerset Levels (or Somerset Levels and Moors as they are less commonly but more correctly known) are a sparsely populated wetland area of central Somerset, between the Quantock and Mendip hills. They consist of marine clay levels along the coast, and the inland (often peat based) moors. The Levels are divided into two by the Polden Hills. Land to the south is drained by the River Parrett while land to the north is drained by the River Axe and the River Brue. The total area of the Levels amounts to about 
and broadly corresponds to the administrative district of Sedgemoor but also includes the south west of Mendip district. Approximately 70% of the area is grassland and 30% is arable.

Stretching about inland, this expanse of flat land barely rises above sea level. Before it was drained, much of the land was under a shallow brackish sea in winter and was marsh land in summer. Drainage began with the Romans, and was restarted at various times: by the Anglo-Saxons; in the Middle Ages by the Glastonbury Abbey, during 1400–1770; and during the Second World War, with the construction of the Huntspill River. Pumping and management of water levels still continues.
The North Somerset Levels basin, north of the Mendips, covers a smaller geographical area than the Somerset Levels; and forms a coastal area around Avonmouth. It too was reclaimed by draining. It is mirrored, across the Severn Estuary, in Wales, by a similar low-lying area: the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels.

In the far west of the county, running into Devon, is Exmoor, a high Devonian sandstone moor, which was designated as a national park in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. The highest point in Somerset is Dunkery Beacon on Exmoor, with a maximum elevation of . Over 100 sites in Somerset have been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

===Coastline===

The coastline of the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary forms part of the northern border of Somerset.
The Bristol Channel has the second largest tidal range in the world. At Burnham-on-Sea, for example, the tidal range of a spring tide is more than .
Proposals for the construction of a Severn Barrage aim to harness this energy. The island of Steep Holm in the Bristol Channel is within the ceremonial county and is now administered by North Somerset Council.

The main coastal towns are, from the west to the north-east, Minehead, Watchet, Burnham-on-Sea, Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon and Portishead. The coastal area between Minehead and the eastern extreme of the administrative county&#x27;s coastline at Brean Down is known as Bridgwater Bay, and is a National Nature Reserve.
North of that, the coast forms Weston Bay and Sand Bay whose northern tip, Sand Point, marks the lower limit of the Severn Estuary. In the mid and north of the county the coastline is low as the level wetlands of the levels meet the sea. In the west, the coastline is high and dramatic where the plateau of Exmoor meets the sea, with high cliffs and waterfalls.

===Climate===
Along with the rest of South West England, Somerset has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, but convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours.

In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

== Governance ==

The ceremonial county of Somerset is currently governed by three unitary authorities: Bath and North East Somerset Council (B&amp;NES), North Somerset Council, and Somerset Council. 
B&amp;NES is also part of the West of England Combined Authority.

Modern local government in Somerset began in 1889, when an administrative county was created and Somerset County Council was established; Bath was administered separately as a county borough. 

In 1974, the county and council were abolished and replaced by two two-tier non-metropolitan counties, Somerset and Avon. Somerset was governed by a reconstituted county council and five districts: Mendip, Sedgemoor, South Somerset, Taunton Deane and West Somerset. Taunton Deane was granted borough status that same year. Avon consisted of six districts, of which three were created from areas formerly part of Somerset: Woodspring, Wansdyke, and Bath.

In 1996, Avon was abolished and its districts were renamed and reorganised into unitary authorities. Woodspring was renamed &#x27;North Somerset&#x27; and Wansdyke and Bath were abolished and a new district covering the same area created, named &#x27;Bath and North East Somerset&#x27;. In 1997 the two districts and non-metropolitan county became part of the new ceremonial county of Somerset. On 1 September 2019 the non-metropolitan districts of West Somerset and Taunton Deane merged, with the new district being called Somerset West and Taunton.

In 2023, the non-metropolitan county was reorganised by abolishing the four districts and their councils and reconstituting Somerset County Council as a unitary authority for the non-metropolitan county, with the powers of both a district and county council, renamed Somerset Council. The two existing unitary authorities were not altered. A previous attempt to reorganise the county as a unitary authority 2007 was rejected following local opposition.

Somerset&#x27;s local government records date to 1617, longer than those of any other county; a meeting of the Quarter Sessions held at Wells in that year decided that a room should be provided &quot;for the safe keeping of the records of the Sessions&quot;.

=== UK Parliament ===
, following the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the ceremonial county of Somerset is divided into 11 parliamentary constituencies, each returning one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons. 


=== European Parliament ===
From 1984 to 1994, Somerset was represented by Conservative Margaret Daly as part of the Somerset and Dorset West constituency for elections to the European Parliament.

From 1994 to 1999, Somerset was represented by Liberal Democrat Graham Watson as part of the Somerset and North Devon constituency for elections to the European Parliament.

From 1999 to 2020, Somerset was part of the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.

===Civil parishes===
Almost all of the county is covered by the lowest/most local form of English local government, the civil parish, with either a town or parish council (a city council in the instance of Wells) or a parish meeting; some parishes group together, with a single council or meeting for the group. The city of Bath (the area of the former county borough) and much of the town of Taunton are unparished areas.

== Demography ==
In the 2011 census the population of the Somerset County Council area was 571,600
with 193,400 in Bath and North East Somerset, and 216,700 in North Somerset giving a total for the ceremonial county of 981,700.

Population growth is higher than the national average, with a 6.4% increase, in the Somerset County Council area, since 1991, and a 17% increase since 1981. The population density is 1.4 persons per hectare, which can be compared to 2.07 persons per hectare for the South West region. Within the county, population density ranges 0.5 in West Somerset to 2.2 persons per hectare in Taunton Deane. The percentage of the population who are economically active is higher than the regional and national average, and the unemployment rate is lower than the regional and national average.

Somerset has a high white British population, with 94.6% registering as white British, and 2.0% as belonging to Black and ethnic minority (BME) groups, according to the 2011 Census. Over 25% of Somerset&#x27;s population is concentrated in Taunton, Bridgwater and Yeovil. The rest of the county is rural and sparsely populated. Over 9 million tourist nights are spent in Somerset each year, which significantly increases the population at peak times.

==Economy==


Somerset has few industrial centres, but it does have a variety of light industry and high technology businesses, along with traditional agriculture and an increasingly important tourism sector, resulting in an unemployment rate of 2.5%. Tourism was estimated in 2013 to support around 26,000 people.

Bridgwater was developed during the Industrial Revolution as the area&#x27;s leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped.

With its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. Leonardo Helicopters, formerly AgustaWestland, manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town.

Somerset is an important supplier of defence equipment and technology. A Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Bridgwater was built at the start of the Second World War, between the villages of Puriton and Woolavington, to manufacture explosives. The site was decommissioned and closed in July 2008. Templecombe has Thales Underwater Systems, and Taunton presently has the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and Avimo, which became part of Thales Optics. It was announced twice, in 2006 and 2007, that manufacturing is to end at Thales Optics&#x27; Taunton site, but the trade unions and Taunton Deane District Council are working to reverse or mitigate these decisions. Other high-technology companies include the optics company Gooch and Housego, at Ilminster. There are Ministry of Defence offices in Bath, and Norton Fitzwarren is the home of 40 Commando Royal Marines. The Royal Naval Air Station in Yeovilton, is one of Britain&#x27;s two active Fleet Air Arm bases and is home to the Royal Navy&#x27;s AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat helicopters and the Royal Marines Commando AgustaWestland AW101 Merlins.
Agriculture and food and drink production continue to be major industries in the county, employing over 15,000 people. Apple orchards were once plentiful, and Somerset is still a major producer of cider. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet are involved with the production of cider, especially Blackthorn Cider, which is sold nationwide, and there are specialist producers such as Burrow Hill Cider Farm and Thatchers Cider. Gerber Products Company in Bridgwater is the largest producer of fruit juices in Europe, producing brands such as Sunny Delight and Ocean Spray. Development of the milk-based industries, such as Ilchester Cheese Company and Yeo Valley Organic, have resulted in the production of ranges of desserts, yoghurts and cheeses.

Traditional willow growing and weaving (such as basket weaving) is not as extensive as it used to be but is still carried out on the Somerset Levels and is commemorated at the Willows and Wetlands Visitor Centre. Fragments of willow basket were found near the Glastonbury Lake Village, and it was also used in the construction of several Iron Age causeways. The willow was harvested using a traditional method of pollarding, where a tree would be cut back to the main stem. During the 1930s more than of willow were being grown commercially on the Levels. Largely due to the displacement of baskets with plastic bags and cardboard boxes, the industry has severely declined since the 1950s. By the end of the 20th century only about were grown commercially, near the villages of Burrowbridge, Westonzoyland and North Curry.

Towns such as Castle Cary and Frome grew around the medieval weaving industry. Street developed as a centre for the production of woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, with C&amp;J Clark establishing its headquarters in the village. C&amp;J Clark&#x27;s shoes are no longer manufactured there as the work was transferred to lower-wage areas, such as China and Asia.
The county has a long tradition of supplying freestone and building stone. Quarries at Doulting supplied freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral. Bath stone is also widely used. Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century, as did Hans Price in the 19th century, but it was used long before then. It was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel, at locations in Wiltshire such as Box. Bath stone is still used on a reduced scale today, but more often as a cladding rather than a structural material. Further south, Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from Ham Hill, which is also widely used in the construction industry. Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement. Until the 1960s, Puriton had Blue Lias stone quarries, as did several other Polden villages. Its quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball, adjacent to the King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain. Its derelict, early 20th century remains, was removed when the M5 motorway was constructed in the mid-1970s. Since the 1920s, the county has supplied aggregates. Foster Yeoman is Europe&#x27;s large supplier of limestone aggregates, with quarries at Merehead Quarry. It has a dedicated railway operation, Mendip Rail, which is used to transport aggregates by rail from a group of Mendip quarries.

In November 2008, a public sector inward investment organisation was launched, called Into Somerset, with the intention of growing the county&#x27;s economy by promoting it to businesses that may wish to relocate from other parts of the UK (especially London) and the world. This now part of the Heart of the South West Growth Hub.

===Nuclear electricity===
Hinkley Point C nuclear power station is a project to construct a 3,200 MW two reactor nuclear power station. On 18 October 2010, the British government announced that Hinkley Point – already the site of the disused Hinkley Point A and (operational at the time) Hinkley Point B power stations – was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. NNB Generation Company, a subsidiary of EDF, submitted an application for development consent to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on 31 October 2011. A protest group, Stop Hinkley, was formed to campaign for the closure of Hinkley Point B and oppose any expansion at the Hinkley Point site. In December 2013, the European Commission opened an investigation to assess whether the project breaks state-aid rules. On 8 October 2014 it was announced that the European Commission has approved the project, with an overwhelming majority and only four commissioners voting against the decision. Construction is underway and is projected to be completed in 2025.

==Emergency services==
All of the ceremonial county of Somerset is covered by the Avon and Somerset Police, a police force which also covers Bristol and South Gloucestershire. The police force is governed by the elected Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner. The Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service covers the area of Somerset County Council as well as the entire ceremonial county of Devon. The unitary districts of North Somerset and Bath &amp; North East Somerset are instead covered by the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, a service which also covers Bristol and South Gloucestershire. The South Western Ambulance Service covers the entire South West of England, including all of Somerset. The Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance is a charitable organisation based in the county.

==Culture==
In Arthurian legend, Avalon became associated with Glastonbury Tor when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have discovered the bones of King Arthur and his queen. What is more certain is that Glastonbury was an important religious centre by 700 and claims to be &quot;the oldest above-ground Christian church in the World&quot; situated &quot;in the mystical land of Avalon&quot;. The claim is based on dating the founding of the community of monks at AD 63, the year of the legendary visit of Joseph of Arimathea, who was supposed to have brought the Holy Grail.

During the Middle Ages there were also important religious sites at Woodspring Priory and Muchelney Abbey. The present Diocese of Bath and Wells covers Somerset – with the exception of the Parish of Abbots Leigh with Leigh Woods in North Somerset – and a small area of Dorset. The Episcopal seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells is now in the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew in the city of Wells, having previously been at Bath Abbey. Before the English Reformation, it was a Roman Catholic diocese; the county now falls within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton. The Benedictine monastery Saint Gregory&#x27;s Abbey, commonly known as Downside Abbey, is at Stratton-on-the-Fosse, and the ruins of the former Cistercian Cleeve Abbey are near the village of Washford.

Somerset has traditions of art, music and literature. Wordsworth and Coleridge wrote while staying in Coleridge Cottage, Nether Stowey. The novelist John Cowper Powys (1872–1963) lived in the Somerset village of Montacute from 1885 until 1894 and his novels &quot;Wood and Stone&quot; (1915) and &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; (1932) are set in Somerset. The writer Evelyn Waugh spent his last years in the village of Combe Florey.Traditional folk music, both song and dance, was important in the agricultural communities. Somerset songs were collected by Cecil Sharp and incorporated into works such as Holst&#x27;s &quot;A Somerset Rhapsody&quot;. Halsway Manor near Williton is an international centre for folk music. The tradition continues today with groups such as The Wurzels specialising in Scrumpy and Western music.

The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts takes place most years in Pilton, near Shepton Mallet, attracting over 170,000 music and culture lovers from around the world to see world-famous entertainers.
The Big Green Gathering which grew out of the Green fields at the Glastonbury Festival is held in the Mendip Hills between Charterhouse and Compton Martin each summer.
The annual Bath Literature Festival is one of several local festivals in the county; others include the Frome Festival and the Trowbridge Village Pump Festival, which, despite its name, is held at Farleigh Hungerford in Somerset. The annual circuit of West Country Carnivals is held in a variety of Somerset towns during the autumn, forming a major regional festival, and the largest Festival of Lights in Europe.

The county has several museums; those at Bath include the American Museum in Britain, the Museum of Bath Architecture, the Herschel Museum of Astronomy, the Jane Austen Centre, and the Roman Baths. Other visitor attractions which reflect the cultural heritage of the county include: Claverton Pumping Station, Dunster Working Watermill, the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton, Nunney Castle, The Helicopter Museum in Weston-super-Mare, King John&#x27;s Hunting Lodge in Axbridge, Blake Museum Bridgwater, Radstock Museum, Museum of Somerset in Taunton, the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury, and Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum.

Somerset has 11,500 listed buildings, 523 scheduled monuments, 192 conservation areas, 41 parks and gardens including those at Barrington Court, Holnicote Estate, Prior Park Landscape Garden and Tintinhull Garden, 36 English Heritage sites and 19 National Trust sites, including Clevedon Court, Fyne Court, Montacute House and Tyntesfield as well as Stembridge Tower Mill, the last remaining thatched windmill in England. Other historic houses in the county which have remained in private ownership or used for other purposes include Halswell House and Marston Bigot. A key contribution of Somerset architecture is its medieval church towers. Jenkins writes, &quot;These structures, with their buttresses, bell-opening tracery and crowns, rank with Nottinghamshire alabaster as England&#x27;s finest contribution to medieval art.&quot;

Bath Rugby play at the Recreation Ground in Bath, and the Somerset County Cricket Club are based at the County Ground in Taunton. The county&#x27;s highest ranked football club is Yeovil Town, currently playing in the National League. Horse racing courses are at Taunton, Bath and Wincanton.

The county is served by the regional &quot;Western Daily Press&quot; and local newspapers including the &quot;Weston &amp; Somerset Mercury&quot;, the &quot;Bath Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Chew Valley Gazette&quot;, &quot;Somerset County Gazette,&quot; &quot;Clevedon Mercury&quot; &quot;Mendip Times&quot;, and the &quot;West Somerset Free Press&quot;. Television is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country, while southwestern parts of the county can receive BBC South West. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset, BBC Radio Bristol (in northern parts of the county), Heart West, and Greatest Hits Radio South West in Yeovil.

A flag representing the historic county of Somerset was registered with the Flag Institute following a competition in July 2013.

==Transport==
Somerset has of roads. The main arterial routes, which include the M5 motorway, A303, A37, A38, A39, A358 and A361 give good access across the county, but many areas can only be accessed via narrow country lanes.

Rail services are provided by the West of England Main Line through Yeovil Junction, the Bristol to Exeter line, Heart of Wessex line which runs from Bristol Temple Meads to Weymouth and the Reading to Taunton line. The main train operator in Somerset is Great Western Railway, with other services operated by South Western Railway and CrossCountry.

Bristol Airport, located in North Somerset, provides national and international air services.

The Somerset Coal Canal was built in the early 19th century to reduce the cost of transportation of coal and other heavy produce. The first , running from a junction with the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal, along the Cam valley, to a terminal basin at Paulton, were in use by 1805, together with several tramways. A planned branch to Midford was never built, but in 1815 a tramway was laid along its towing path. In 1871 the tramway was purchased by the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway (S&amp;DJR), and operated until the 1950s.

The 19th century saw improvements to Somerset&#x27;s roads with the introduction of turnpikes, and the building of canals and railways. Nineteenth-century canals included the Bridgwater &amp; Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset &amp; Somerset Canal was proposed, but little of it was ever constructed and it was abandoned in 1803.

The usefulness of the canals was short-lived, though some have now been restored for recreation. The 19th century also saw the construction of railways to and through Somerset. The county was served by five pre-1923 Grouping railway companies: the Great Western Railway (GWR); a branch of the Midland Railway (MR) to Bath Green Park (and another one to Bristol); the S&amp;DJR, and the London &amp; South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR).

The former main lines of the GWR are still in use today, although many of its branch lines were scrapped as part of the Beeching cuts. The former lines of the S&amp;DJR closed completely, as has the branch of the Midland Railway to Bath Green Park (and to Bristol St Philips). The L&amp;SWR survived as a part of the present West of England Main Line. None of these lines, in Somerset, are electrified. Two branch lines, the West and East Somerset Railways, were rescued and transferred back to private ownership as &quot;heritage&quot; lines. The fifth railway was a short-lived light railway, the Weston, Clevedon &amp; Portishead Light Railway. The West Somerset Mineral Railway carried the iron ore from the Brendon Hills to Watchet.

Until the 1960s the piers at Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon, Portishead and Minehead were served by the paddle steamers of P &amp; A Campbell who ran regular services to Barry and Cardiff as well as Ilfracombe and Lundy Island. The original stone pier at Burnham-on-Sea was used for commercial goods, one of the reasons for the S&amp;DJR was to provide a link between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. The newer concrete pier at Burnham-on-Sea is claimed to be the shortest pier in Britain. In the 1970s the Royal Portbury Dock was constructed to provide extra capacity for the Port of Bristol.

For long-distance holiday traffic travelling through the county to and from Devon and Cornwall, Somerset is often regarded as a marker on the journey. North–south traffic moves through the county via the M5 motorway. Traffic to and from the east travels either via the A303 road, or the M4 motorway, which runs east–west, crossing the M5 motorway just beyond the northern limits of the county.

==Education==

State schools in Somerset are provided by three local education authorities: Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset, and the larger Somerset County Council. All state schools are comprehensive. In some areas primary, infant and junior schools cater for ages four to eleven, after which the pupils move on to secondary schools. There is a three-tier system of first, middle and upper schools in the Cheddar Valley, and in West Somerset, while most other schools in the county use the two-tier system. Somerset has 30 state and 17 independent secondary schools; Bath and North East Somerset has 13 state and 5 independent secondary schools; and North Somerset has 10 state and 2 independent secondary schools, excluding sixth form colleges.
Some of the county&#x27;s secondary schools have specialist school status. Some schools have sixth forms and others transfer their sixth formers to colleges. Several schools can trace their origins back many years, such as The Blue School in Wells and Richard Huish College in Taunton. Others have changed their names over the years such as Beechen Cliff School which was started in 1905 as the City of Bath Boys&#x27; School and changed to its present name in 1972 when the grammar school was amalgamated with a local secondary modern school, to form a comprehensive school. Many others were established and built since the Second World War. In 2006, 5,900 pupils in Somerset sat GCSE examinations, with 44.5% achieving 5 grades A-C including English and Maths (compared to 45.8% for England).

Sexey&#x27;s School is a state boarding school in Bruton that also takes day pupils from the surrounding area. The Somerset LEA also provides special schools such as Newbury Manor School, which caters for children aged between 10 and 17 with special educational needs. Provision for pupils with special educational needs is also made by the mainstream schools.

There is also a range of private or public schools. Many of these are for pupils between 11 and 18 years, such as King&#x27;s College, Taunton, Wellington School, Somerset and Taunton School. King&#x27;s School, Bruton, was founded in 1519 and received royal foundation status around 30 years later in the reign of Edward VI. Millfield is the largest co-educational boarding school. There are also preparatory schools for younger children, such as All Hallows, and Hazlegrove Preparatory School. Chilton Cantelo School offers places both to day pupils and boarders aged 7 to 16. Other schools provide education for children from the age of 3 or 4 years through to 18, such as King Edward&#x27;s School, Bath, Queen&#x27;s College, Taunton and Wells Cathedral School which is one of the five established musical schools for school-age children in Britain.

Some of these schools have religious affiliations, such as Monkton Combe School, Prior Park College, Sidcot School which is associated with the Religious Society of Friends, Downside School which is a Roman Catholic public school in Stratton-on-the-Fosse, situated next to the Benedictine Downside Abbey, and Kingswood School, which was founded by John Wesley in 1748 in Kingswood near Bristol, originally for the education of the sons of the itinerant ministers (clergy) of the Methodist Church.

===Further and higher education===
A wide range of adult education and further education courses is available in Somerset, in schools, colleges and other community venues. The colleges include Weston College, Bridgwater and Taunton College (formed in 2016 when Bridgwater College and Somerset College of Arts and Technology merged, and includes the Taunton-based University Centre Somerset), Bath College, Frome Community College, Richard Huish College, Strode College and Yeovil College. Somerset County Council operates Dillington House, a residential adult education college located in Ilminster.

The University of Bath, Bath Spa University and University Centre Weston are higher education establishments in the north of the county. The University of Bath gained its Royal Charter in 1966, although its origins go back to the Bristol Trade School (founded 1856) and Bath School of Pharmacy (founded 1907). It has a purpose-built campus at Claverton on the outskirts of Bath, and has 15,000 students. Bath Spa University, which is based at Newton St Loe, achieved university status in 2005, and has origins including the Bath Academy of Art (founded 1898), Bath Teacher Training College, and the Bath College of Higher Education. It has several campuses and 5,500 students.

<doc id="51764" wikidata="Q552098" url="?curid=51764" title="Rock Around the Clock">
<text>&quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; is a rock and roll song in the 12-bar blues format written by Max C. Freedman and James E. Myers (the latter being under the pseudonym &quot;Jimmy De Knight&quot;) in 1952. The best-known and most successful rendition was recorded by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets in 1954 for American Decca. It was a number one single for two months and did well on the United Kingdom charts; the recording also reentered the UK Singles Chart in the 1960s and 1970s.

It was the first rock and roll record to top the pop charts in both the US and UKBill Haley had American chart success with &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot; in 1953, and in 1954, &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; sung by Big Joe Turner reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. Haley&#x27;s recording became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth, particularly after it was included in the 1955 film &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;. It was number 1 on the pop charts for two months and went to number 3 on the R&amp;B chart.

The recording is widely considered to be the song that, more than any other, brought rock and roll into mainstream culture around the world. The song is ranked No. 159 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Although it was first recorded by Italian-American band Sonny Dae and His Knights on March 20, 1954, Myers claimed the song had been written specifically for Haley but, for legal reasons, Haley was unable to record it himself until April 12, 1954.

The original full title of the song was &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Rock Around the Clock Tonight!&quot;. This was later shortened to &quot;(We&#x27;re Gonna) Rock Around the Clock&quot;, though this form is generally only used on releases of the 1954 Bill Haley Decca Records recording; most other recordings of this song by Haley and others (including Sonny Dae) shorten this title further to its present form.

In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==False starts==
There are sources that indicate that &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was written in 1953, but documents uncovered by historian Jim Dawson indicate it was in fact written in late 1952. The original arrangement of the song bore little resemblance to the version recorded by Haley, and was in fact closer to a popular instrumental of the day called &quot;The Syncopated Clock&quot; (written by Leroy Anderson).

The song was credited to Myers (as &quot;Jimmy DeKnight&quot;) and Max C. Freedman when it was copyrighted on March 31, 1953. However, its exact authorship is disputed, with many speculating that Freedman wrote the song on his own. There were several earlier songs of the title &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (by Hal Singer and Wally Mercer), but they are unrelated to the Freedman/Myers song. In addition, it is sometimes erroneously stated that &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; is copied from a late-1940s Big Joe Turner recording, &quot;Around the Clock Blues&quot;. Though the titles are similar, the two songs bear little resemblance. There are many blues songs with the theme of partying or making love &quot;round the clock&quot;, with various actions specified at various hours.

However, the verse melody of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; does bear a very close similarity to that of Hank Williams&#x27; first hit, &quot;Move It On Over&quot;, from 1947. 

According to the Haley biographies &quot;Bill Haley&quot; by John Swenson and &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; by Dawson, the song was offered to Haley by Jimmy Myers in the wake of his first national success, &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot; in 1953, after being copyrighted with the U.S. Library of Congress on March 31. Haley and his Comets began performing the song on stage (Comets bass player Marshall Lytle and drummer Dick Richards say the first performances were in Wildwood, New Jersey at Phil and Eddie&#x27;s Surf Club), but Dave Miller, his producer, refused to allow Haley to record it for his Essex Records label (Swenson suggests a feud existed between Myers and Miller).

Haley himself claimed to have taken the sheet music into the recording studio at least twice, with Miller ripping up the music each time. Nonetheless, rumors of a 1953 demo recording by Haley persist to this day, although surviving members of the Comets deny this, as did Haley himself (quoted in the Swenson biography); a late-1960s bootleg single of the Decca Records version of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, with &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot; on the B-side and carrying the Essex label, occasionally turns up for sale with the claim that it is the demo version.

Myers next offered the song to and organized the recording by Sonny Dae &amp; His Knights, a novelty all-white musical group led by Italian-American Paschal Vennitti. The group&#x27;s subsequent recording, on the Arcade Records label (owned by Haley&#x27;s manager, Jack Howard), was a regional success, although it sounded very different from what Haley would later record.
==Decca recording session==
After leaving Essex Records in the spring of 1954, Bill Haley signed with Decca Records, and the band&#x27;s first recording session was set for April 12, 1954, at Decca&#x27;s studios in the Pythian Temple in New York City. The recording session almost failed to take place because the band was traveling on a ferry that got stuck on a sandbar en route to New York from Philadelphia. Once at the studio, producer Milt Gabler (Gabler was the uncle of actor Billy Crystal and had produced Louis Jordan as well as Billie Holiday), insisted the band work on a song entitled &quot;Thirteen Women (and Only One Man in Town)&quot; (written and previously recorded by Dickie Thompson), which Gabler wanted to promote as the A-side of the group&#x27;s first single for Decca.

Near the end of the session, the band finally recorded a take of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, but Haley&#x27;s vocals were drowned out by the band. A second take was quickly made with minimal accompaniment while Sammy Davis Jr. waited outside the studio for his turn behind the microphone. Decca engineers later combined the two versions into one version. (Comets piano player Johnny Grande tells a slightly different version, claiming that the only reason a second take was recorded was that the drummer made an error.)

Many musicians have claimed that they performed on the recording session for &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. Song co-writer Myers once claimed he had played drums on the piece, although he also claimed to have been advising the sound mixer in the recording booth. According to the official record sheet from the session, however, the musicians on the famous recording are:

* Bill Haley – vocals, rhythm guitar
* Marshall Lytle – double bass
* Franny Beecher - guitar
* Billy Williamson – steel guitar
* Johnny Grande – piano
* Billy Gussak – drums (session musician)
* Danny Cedrone – electric guitar
* Joey Ambrose (aka Joey D&#x27;Ambrosio) – tenor saxophone

Dick Richards, Haley&#x27;s drummer at the time, confirmed in a 2016 interview with Dutch journalist Gerbren Deves, that it was not him, but Gussak playing drums on the recording. Despite not being members of Bill Haley and His Comets, Gussak and Cedrone were trusted session players that Haley had used before. Cedrone&#x27;s guitar solo was one that he used before on Bill Haley And The Saddlemen&#x27;s version of &quot;Rock the Joint&quot; in 1952, and is considered one of the classic rock and roll guitar solos of all time. (Cedrone died in a fall down a stairway on June 17, 1954, and never lived to see his contribution become famous and legendary.) The second instrumental break recreates a popular rhythm and blues &quot;out chorus&quot; with tenor sax and guitar emulating the rhythm section.

The version of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; that was used in the movie &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; differs from the hit single version. The difference is in the two solo breaks. The record has the guitar solo taking the first break and the sax solo taking the second break. The movie version is just the opposite with the sax solo coming first.

In a 2005 retrospective on his uncle Milt Gabler&#x27;s work (&quot;The Milt Gabler Story&quot;), Billy Crystal identifies Haley&#x27;s 1954 recording of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; as the single most important song Gabler ever produced. Gabler had previously been responsible for the highly successful string of R&amp;B and jump blues recordings by Louis Jordan in the late 1940s, which were characterised by their strong beat, clearly enunciated lyrics and high production values, all features which Gabler sought to repeat in Haley&#x27;s recordings. Also significantly, &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was recorded in the very same month that Atlantic Records issued Big Joe Turner&#x27;s &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;. In relation to &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, Gabler said: &quot;I was aware that rock was starting. I knew what was happening in the Philadelphia area, and &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot; had been a hit about a year before that. It already was starting and I wanted to take it from there.&quot;

Although the record is sometimes claimed to be the first in the rock and roll genre, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; were generally not considered the first rock and roll records but rather &quot;the first white artists&#x27; interpretations of a sound already well-established by black musicians almost a decade before. It was a raucous, driving, unnamed variant of rhythm and blues that came complete with lyrics that talked about &#x27;rocking&#x27;.&quot; Later in the same article, Petridis relates that Tony Cajiao, then the editor of Now Dig This!, offered the conclusion &quot;... you have to say that Rock Around the Clock was the first record that really brought everything together, that made tremors around the world.&quot;

==Slow road to classic hit status==
As Gabler intended, &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was first issued in May 1954 as a B-side to &quot;Thirteen Women (and Only One Man in Town)&quot;. While the song did make the American &quot;Cashbox&quot; music charts (contrary to popular opinion that it was a flop), it was considered a commercial disappointment. It was not until 1955, when &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was used under the opening credits and four additional times in the film &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;, that the song truly took off.

Many versions of the story behind how &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was chosen for &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; circulated over the years. Recent research, however, reveals that the song was chosen from the collection of young Peter Ford, the son of &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; star Glenn Ford and dancer Eleanor Powell. The producers were looking for a song to represent the type of music the youth of 1955 were listening to. The elder Ford borrowed several records from his son, one of which was Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. In 2004, the song finished at #50 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.

On July 9, 1955 &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; became the first rock and roll recording to hit the top of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Pop charts, a feat it repeated on charts around the world. The song stayed at this place for eight weeks. The record was also no.1 for seven weeks on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; pop singles chart in 1955. The Bill Haley version also hit number three on the R&amp;B charts. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1955, behind Perez Prado&#x27;s &quot;Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)&quot;.

In the UK, Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was released on Brunswick Records (and Germany as well), reaching number 17 on the UK Singles Chart in January 1955, four months before it first entered the US pop charts. The song re-entered the UK chart to reach number one in November 1955 for three weeks, and after a three-week break returned there for a further two weeks in January 1956. It re-entered the charts again in September 1956, reaching number 5. The song was re-issued in 1968, when it made number 20, and again in 1974, when it reached number 12. The song&#x27;s original release saw it become the UK&#x27;s first million selling single and it went on to sell over 1.4 million copies in total.

The band performed the song on the May 31, 1955 episode of Texaco Star Theater hosted by Milton Berle in an a cappella and lip-synched versions. On August 7, 1955, the band performed the song on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, hosted by Ed Sullivan.

On the heels of the song breaking into the Top 20 in the UK in 1968, Decca began plugging the single in the US, where it briefly re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in June 1968, peaking at #118.

&quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; became wildly popular with teenagers around the world. The single, released by independent label Festival Records in Australia, was the biggest-selling recording in the country at the time. Columbia Pictures cashed in on the new craze by hiring Haley and his band to star in two movies, &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (1956) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot; (1957). In 1957, Haley toured Europe, bringing rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll to that continent for the first time.

In 1964, Bill Haley and His Comets recorded a sequel song entitled &quot;Dance Around the Clock&quot;. Haley actually recorded this song on five occasions (a Spanish-language version for Orfeón of Mexico City and an English version for the US label Newtown Records (both in 1964), two live versions for Buddah Records recorded in New York in 1969 (neither of which were released for 25 years), and once more in Nashville, Tennessee for the Swedish Sonet Records label in 1970). Despite these efforts, the song was not a commercial success.

Haley would re-record &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; many times over the years (even scoring a substantial hit with a version recorded for Sonet Records in 1968), but never recaptured the magic. In 1974, the original version of the song returned to the American charts when it was used as the theme for the movie &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and a re-recorded version by Haley was used as the opening theme for the TV series &quot;Happy Days&quot; during its first two seasons. In the UK, the song again reached the top 20 and as of 2013 remains the only non-Christmas single to have done so on five separate occasions. The original version was also featured in the 1978 film &quot;Superman&quot;, heard playing on a car radio just prior to Glenn Ford&#x27;s final scene in the film; Ford, as noted earlier, had starred in &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;. In 1981, about a year before Haley&#x27;s death, a portion of the 1954 recording was featured in the opening credits of Season 6 of &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;.

During the 1970s, Haley shortened his performances of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, dropping one verse and the second instrumental break from most performances. However, his last known recorded performance of the song, at a November 1979 command performance for Queen Elizabeth II, was a complete version.

Following Haley&#x27;s death in February 1981, a number of major tributes involving &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; occurred. That fall, a TV special marking the 30th anniversary of &quot;American Bandstand&quot; saw an all-star &quot;supergroup&quot; perform the song (accompanied by 1950s-era footage of Haley and the Comets). In 1982, Haley&#x27;s original recording was given the Grammy Hall of Fame Award. An excerpt from the recording was included in &quot;Haley&#x27;s Golden Medley&quot;, a hastily compiled single in the &quot;Stars on 45&quot; mold which made the UK record charts in 1982, reaching number 50. In 1989, Haley&#x27;s original Decca recording was incorporated into the &quot;dance mix&quot; single &quot;Swing The Mood&quot;, credited to Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers, but legal considerations forced the album version to substitute a patchwork of re-recordings from the 1950s and 1960s (in Haley&#x27;s case, a 1968 version of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; recorded for Sonet Records). Since &quot;Swing the Mood&quot; was still on the sales charts going into 1990, it meant that Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, in one way or another, appeared on UK or US sales charts in five consecutive decades.

&quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; is often cited as the biggest-selling vinyl rock and roll single of all time. The exact number of copies sold has never been audited; however, a figure of at least 25 million was cited by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; in its category &quot;Phonograph records: Biggest Sellers&quot; from the early 1970s until the 1990s, when the advent of compact discs led to Guinness discontinuing the category. Guinness consistently listed &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; as having the highest claim of any pop music recording, coming second in sales only to Bing Crosby&#x27;s 1942 recording of &quot;White Christmas&quot;, which was also listed as having sold 25 million copies. Haley&#x27;s version alone is estimated to have sold 15 million copies, with a total of 30 million copies counting all versions. A frequently used piece of promotion regarding the song is that it is said to be playing somewhere in the world every minute of the day.

==Length variation==
Although originally released on vinyl 45 and shellac 78 at a running time of 2 minutes and 8 seconds, most digital/CD releases of the original 1954 recording, starting with the &quot;From The Original Master Tapes&quot; compilation of Haley&#x27;s work with Decca Records, mastered by Steve Hoffman and released in 1985, clock in at 2:10. This is due to the inclusion of a &quot;count-in&quot; by one of the Comets (saying, &quot;One ... two&quot;) at the very start of the song. This was never included in the original single or album releases of the song. (All of Haley&#x27;s subsequent studio rerecordings of the song run longer than 2:10 with the exception of the abbreviated version recorded for &quot;Happy Days&quot;.) There are no other studio-recorded versions after the 1950s and &quot;Happy Days&quot; versions.

==Tributes==
In tribute to the influence of the song and the movie that launched its popularity, the March 29, 2005 50th anniversary of the opening of &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; was marked by several large celebrations in the United States organized by promoter Martin Lewis under the blanket title &quot;Rock Is Fifty&quot;. Rock Is Fifty also hosted additional celebrations in Los Angeles in July, 2005, as part of a &quot;Rock Around the Clock-a-Thon&quot; to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the date the song reached the No. 1 spot on the American charts, as well as to observe what would have been Haley&#x27;s 80th birthday. These events included numerous appearances and performances by surviving members of the original Comets, including the band&#x27;s induction into the Rock Walk hall of fame, a performance at the Viper Room club on the Sunset Strip, and a special performance for employees of NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena to celebrate the success of the Deep Impact space probe. A special video of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was created to mark the occasion and was featured on NASA&#x27;s website during July and August 2005. The anniversary was also marked by the publication of a book entirely devoted to the history of the song, &quot;Rock Around the Clock: The Record That Started the Rock Revolution&quot;, by Jim Dawson.

The United States House of Representatives also recognized the 40th anniversary of the composing of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; with a special statement by Rep. Robert A. Borski of Pennsylvania, which was read into the Congressional Record on March 31, 1993.
The Belgian band Telex covered the song in 1978. They performed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Their version peaked at number 51 in Australia in 1979.

The Sex Pistols covered it for their soundtrack The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle in 1979.

The song was featured in Season 7 of the series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in 2008 in a jive dance sequence.

Haley&#x27;s version appears in a 2017 commercial for Subway&#x27;s Reuben sandwich promotion.

The 1954 Decca Records studio recording was featured on the ABC TV show &quot;Dancing with the Stars: Juniors&quot; in the 2018 season during a dance sequence.

John Legend performed the song on the season finale of &quot;The Voice&quot; on &quot;NBC&quot; on May 21, 2019, as &quot;Block Around the Clock&quot;.

==Albums==
As Bill Haley&#x27;s best-known recording, there have been dozens of compilation album releases over the years entitled &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. The most notable of these compilations was the 1955 Decca Records album &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (Decca DL 8225) which contained most of the tracks Haley recorded as singles for the label in 1954 and 1955.

Another notable album release entitled &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was the 1970 Hallmark Records UK release &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (SHM 668) which was the first British release of a 1968 album entitled &quot;Bill Haley&#x27;s Biggest Hits&quot; which had been released in Sweden by Sonet Records. The album consisted of newly recorded renderings of Haley classics from the 1950s, along with some previously unrecorded songs.

<doc id="51765" wikidata="Q16966" url="?curid=51765" title="Duomo">
<text>Duomo (, ) is an Italian term for a church with the features of, or having been built to serve as a cathedral, whether or not it currently plays this role. The Duomo of Monza, for example, has never been a diocesan seat and is by definition not a cathedral. In a similar way, the town of Asolo has not had its own bishop since the 10th century, but the main church (rebuilt since then) is still called the Asolo Duomo. By contradistinction, the Italian word for a cathedral &quot;sensu stricto&quot; is &quot;cattedrale&quot;. There is no direct translation of &quot;duomo&quot; into English, leading to many such churches being erroneously called &quot;cathedral&quot; in English, regardless of whether the church in question hosts a bishop. Each city or town will have only one &quot;duomo&quot;, unless there are different denominations involved.

Locally, people usually use &quot;il Duomo&quot;, the &quot;Duomo&quot;, without regard to the full proper name of the church.

Similar words exist in other European languages: &quot;Dom&quot; (German and Dutch), &quot;dom&quot; (Romanian), &quot;dóm&quot; (Hungarian and Slovak), &quot;dôme&quot; (French - usually less common), &quot;domo&quot; (Portuguese), &quot;doms&quot; (Latvian), &quot;tum&quot; (Polish), &quot;domkirke&quot; (Danish and Norwegian), &quot;dómkirkja&quot; (Icelandic), &quot;domkyrka&quot; (Swedish), &quot;toomkirik&quot; (Estonian), &quot;tuomiokirkko&quot; (Finnish) and so on. Also in these languages the respective terms do not necessarily refer to a church functioning as a cathedral, but also to proto-cathedrals or simply prominent church buildings, which have never been a cathedral in the exact sense of that word. German &quot;Dom&quot; and Polish &quot;tum&quot; became the synecdoche used – &quot;pars pro toto&quot; – for most existing or former collegiate churches. Therefore, translation of these terms into English as &quot;cathedrals&quot; may not always be appropriate and should be used on a contextual basis. Generally, only the Italian &quot;duomo&quot; and the German &quot;Dom&quot; are likely to be encountered in English. 

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Zingarelli&quot;, the word &quot;duomo&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;domus&quot;, meaning &quot;house&quot;, as a cathedral is the &quot;house of God&quot;, or &quot;domus Dei&quot;. The &quot;Garzanti online dictionary&quot; also gives the etymology as deriving from &quot;house&quot;, but &quot;house of the bishop&quot; instead.

Italian cathedrals are often highly decorated and contain notable artworks; in many cases the buildings themselves are true artworks. Perhaps the best known &quot;duomo&quot; is the one in Florence, but other well-known cathedrals include the Milan Cathedral and those of Siena, Alba, Ancona, Mantua and Parma.

<text>Elias δ code or Elias delta code is a universal code encoding the positive integers developed by Peter Elias.

== Encoding ==
To code a number &quot;X&quot; ≥ 1:
# Let &quot;N&quot; = ⌊log2 &quot;X&quot;⌋; be the highest power of 2 in &quot;X&quot;, so 2&quot;N&quot; ≤ &quot;X&quot; &lt; 2&quot;N&quot;+1.
# Let &quot;L&quot; = ⌊log2 &quot;N&quot;+1⌋ be the highest power of 2 in &quot;N&quot;+1, so 2&quot;L&quot; ≤ &quot;N&quot;+1 &lt; 2&quot;L&quot;+1.
# Write &quot;L&quot; zeros, followed by
# the &quot;L&quot;+1-bit binary representation of &quot;N&quot;+1, followed by
# all but the leading bit (i.e. the last &quot;N&quot; bits) of &quot;X&quot;.

An equivalent way to express the same process:
#Separate &quot;X&quot; into the highest power of 2 it contains (2&quot;N&quot;) and the remaining &quot;N&quot; binary digits.
#Encode &quot;N&quot;+1 with Elias gamma coding.
#Append the remaining &quot;N&quot; binary digits to this representation of &quot;N&quot;+1.

To represent a number formula_1, Elias delta (δ) uses formula_2 bits.
This is useful for very large integers, where the overall encoded representation&#x27;s bits end up being fewer [than what one might obtain using Elias gamma coding] due to the formula_3 portion of the previous expression.

The code begins, using formula_4 instead of formula_5:

To decode an Elias delta-coded integer:
#Read and count zeros from the stream until you reach the first one. Call this count of zeros &quot;L&quot;.
#Considering the one that was reached to be the first digit of an integer, with a value of 2&quot;L&quot;, read the remaining &quot;L&quot; digits of the integer. Call this integer &quot;N&quot;+1, and subtract one to get &quot;N&quot;.
#Put a one in the first place of our final output, representing the value 2&quot;N&quot;.
#Read and append the following &quot;N&quot; digits.

Example:
 001010011
 1. 2 leading zeros in 001
 2. read 2 more bits i.e. 00101
 3. decode N+1 = 00101 = 5
 4. get N = 5 − 1 = 4 remaining bits for the complete code i.e. &#x27;0011&#x27;
 5. encoded number = 24 + 3 = 19

This code can be generalized to zero or negative integers in the same ways described in Elias gamma coding.

== Example code ==

=== Encoding ===

void eliasDeltaEncode(char* source, char* dest)
 IntReader intreader(source);
 BitWriter bitwriter(dest);
 while (intreader.hasLeft())
 int num = intreader.getInt();
 int len = 0;
 int lengthOfLen = 0;

 len = 1 + floor(log2(num)); // calculate 1+floor(log2(num))
 lengthOfLen = floor(log2(len)); // calculate floor(log2(len))
 for (int i = lengthOfLen; i &gt; 0; --i)
 bitwriter.outputBit(0);
 for (int i = lengthOfLen; i &gt;= 0; --i)
 bitwriter.outputBit((len » i) &amp; 1);
 for (int i = len-2; i &gt;= 0; i--)
 bitwriter.outputBit((num » i) &amp; 1);
 bitwriter.close();
 intreader.close();


=== Decoding ===

void eliasDeltaDecode(char* source, char* dest)
 BitReader bitreader(source);
 IntWriter intwriter(dest);
 while (bitreader.hasLeft())
 int num = 1;
 int len = 1;
 int lengthOfLen = 0;
 while (!bitreader.inputBit()) // potentially dangerous with malformed files.
 lengthOfLen++;
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; lengthOfLen; i++)
 len «= 1;
 if (bitreader.inputBit())
 len |= 1;
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; len-1; i++)
 num «= 1;
 if (bitreader.inputBit())
 num |= 1;
 intwriter.putInt(num); // write out the value
 bitreader.close();
 intwriter.close();


== Generalizations ==

Elias delta coding does not code zero or negative integers.
One way to code all non negative integers is to add 1 before coding and then subtract 1 after decoding.
One way to code all integers is to set up a bijection, mapping integers all integers (0, 1, −1, 2, −2, 3, −3, ...) to strictly positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...) before coding.
This bijection can be performed using the &quot;ZigZag&quot; encoding from Protocol Buffers (not to be confused with Zigzag code, nor the JPEG Zig-zag entropy coding).

<text>Sidney Altman (May 7, 1939 – April 5, 2022) was a Canadian-American molecular biologist, who was the Sterling Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Chemistry at Yale University. In 1989, he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Thomas R. Cech for their work on the catalytic properties of RNA.

==Family and education==
Altman was born on May 7, 1939, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His parents, Ray (Arlin), a textile worker, and Victor Altman, a grocer, were Jewish immigrants to Canada, each coming from Eastern Europe as a young adult, in the 1920s. Altman&#x27;s mother was from Białystok in Poland, and had come to Canada with her sister at the age of eighteen, learning English and working in a textile factory to earn money to bring the rest of their family to Quebec. Altman&#x27;s father, born in Ukraine, had been a worker on a collective farm in the Soviet Union. He was sponsored to come to Canada as a farm worker, but later, as a husband and a father of two sons, he supported the family by running a small grocery store in Montreal. Sidney Altman was later to look back on his parents&#x27; lives as an illustration of the value of the work ethic: &quot;It was from them I learned that hard work in stable surroundings could yield rewards, even if only in infinitesimally small increments.&quot;

As Altman reached adulthood, the family&#x27;s financial situation had become secure enough that he was able to pursue a college education. He went to the United States to study physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While at MIT, he was a member of the ice hockey team. After achieving his bachelor&#x27;s degree from MIT in 1960, Altman spent 18 months as a graduate student in physics at Columbia University. Due to personal concerns and the lack of opportunity for beginning graduate students to participate in laboratory work, he left the program without completing the degree. Some months later, he enrolled as a graduate student in biophysics at the University of Colorado Medical Center. His project was a study of the effects of acridines on the replication of bacteriophage T4 DNA. He received his Ph.D. in biophysics from the University of Colorado in 1967 with thesis advisor Leonard Lerman; Lerman went in 1967 to Vanderbilt University, where Altman worked briefly as a researcher in molecular biology before leaving for Harvard.

Altman was married to Ann M. Körner (daughter of Stephan Körner) in 1972. They are the parents of two children, Daniel and Leah. Having lived primarily in the United States since departing Montreal to attend MIT in 1958, Altman became a U.S. citizen in 1984, maintaining dual citizenship as a Canadian citizen as well.

==Career==
After receiving his Ph.D., Altman embarked upon the first of two research fellowships. He joined Matthew Meselson&#x27;s laboratory at Harvard University to study a DNA endonuclease involved in the replication and recombination of T4 DNA. Later, at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, Altman started the work that led to the discovery of RNase P and the enzymatic properties of the RNA subunit of that ribozyme. John D. Smith, as well as several postdoctoral colleagues, provided Altman with very good advice that enabled him to test his ideas. &quot;The discovery of the first radiochemically pure precursor to a tRNA molecule enabled me to get a job as an assistant professor at Yale University in 1971, a difficult time to get any job at all&quot;.

Altman&#x27;s career at Yale followed a standard academic pattern with promotion through the ranks until he became Professor in 1980. He was Chairman of his department from 1983 to 1985 and in 1985 became the Dean of Yale College for four years. On July 1, 1989, he returned to the post of Professor on a full-time basis. His doctoral students include Ben Stark.

While at Yale, Altman&#x27;s Nobel Prize work came with the analysis of the catalytic properties of the ribozyme RNase P, a ribonucleoprotein particle consisting of both a structural RNA molecule and one (in prokaryotes) or more (in eukaryotes) proteins. Originally, it was believed that, in the bacterial RNase P complex, the protein subunit was responsible for the catalytic activity of the complex, which is involved in the maturation of tRNAs. During experiments in which the complex was reconstituted in test tubes, Altman and his group discovered that the RNA component, in isolation, was sufficient for the observed catalytic activity of the enzyme, indicating that the RNA itself had catalytic properties, which was the discovery that earned him the Nobel Prize. Although the RNase P complex also exists in eukaryotic organisms, his later work revealed that in those organisms, the protein subunits of the complex are essential to the catalytic activity, in contrast to the bacterial RNase P.

==Recognition==
Altman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1988 and a member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1990.

==Death==
Altman died on April 5, 2022, in Rockleigh, New Jersey, after a long illness.
