<text>Human capital or human assets is a concept used by economists to designate personal attributes considered useful in the production process. It encompasses employee knowledge, skills, know-how, good health, and education. Human capital has a substantial impact on individual earnings. Research indicates that human capital investments have high economic returns throughout childhood and young adulthood.

Companies can invest in human capital; for example, through education and training, improving levels of quality and production.

==History==

Adam Smith included in his definition of capital &quot;the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of the society&quot;. The first use of the
term &quot;human capital&quot; may be by Irving Fisher. An early discussion with the phrase &quot;human capital&quot; was from Arthur Cecil Pigou:

But the term only found widespread use in economics after its popularization by economists of the Chicago School, in particular Gary Becker, Jacob Mincer, and Theodore Schultz.

The early 20th century Austrian sociologist Rudolf Goldscheid&#x27;s theory of organic capital and the human economy also served as a precedent for later concepts of human capital.

The use of the term in the modern neoclassical economic literature dates back to Jacob Mincer&#x27;s article &quot;Investment in Human Capital and Personal Income Distribution&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; in 1958. Then Theodore Schultz also contributed to the development of the subject matter. The best-known application of the idea of &quot;human capital&quot; in economics is that of Mincer and Gary Becker. Becker&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Human Capital&quot;, published in 1964, became a standard reference for many years. In this view, human capital is similar to &quot;physical means of production&quot;, e.g., factories and machines: one can invest in human capital (via education, training, medical treatment) and one&#x27;s outputs depend partly on the rate of return on the human capital one owns. Thus, human capital is a means of production, into which additional investment yields additional output. Human capital is substitutable, but not transferable like land, labor, or fixed capital.

Some contemporary growth theories see human capital as an important economic growth factor. Further research shows the relevance of education for the economic welfare of people.

Adam Smith defined four types of fixed capital (which is characterized as that which affords a revenue or profit without circulating or changing masters). The four types were:
# useful machines, instruments of the trade;
# buildings as the means of procuring revenue;
# improvements of land;
# the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of the society.
Smith defined human capital as follows:

Fourthly, of the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of the society. The acquisition of such talents, by the maintenance of the acquirer during his education, study, or apprenticeship, always costs a real expense, which is a capital fixed and realized, as it were, in his person. Those talents, as they make a part of his fortune, so do they likewise that of the society to which he belongs. The improved dexterity of a workman may be considered in the same light as a machine or instrument of trade which facilitates and abridges labor, and which, though it costs a certain expense, repays that expense with a profit.
Therefore, Smith argued, the productive power of labor are both dependent on the division of labor:

The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labor, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgement with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labor.

There is a complex relationship between the division of labor and human capital.

In the 1990s, the concept of human capital was extended to include natural abilities, physical fitness and healthiness, which are crucial for an individual&#x27;s success in acquiring knowledge and skills.

As a result of his conceptualization and modeling work using Human Capital as a key factor, the 2018 Nobel Prize for Economics was jointly awarded to Paul Romer, who founded the modern innovation-driven approach to understanding economic growth.

In the recent literature, the new concept of task-specific human capital was coined in 2004 by Robert Gibbons, an economist at MIT, and Michael Waldman, an economist at Cornell University. The concept emphasizes that in many cases, human capital is accumulated specific to the nature of the task (or, skills required for the task), and the human capital accumulated for the task are valuable to many firms requiring the transferable skills. This concept can be applied to job-assignment, wage dynamics, tournament, promotion dynamics inside firms, etc.

==Background==

&quot;Human capital&quot; in a broad sense is a collection of activities: all the knowledge, skills, abilities, experience, intelligence, training and competences possessed individually and collectively by individuals in a population. These resources are the total capacity of the people that represents a form of wealth that can be directed to accomplish the goals of the nation or state or a portion thereof. The human capital is further distributed into three kinds;
# Knowledge capital
# Social capital
# Emotional capital.

Many theories explicitly connect investment in human capital development to education, and the role of human capital in economic development, productivity growth, and innovation has frequently been cited as a justification for government subsidies for education and job skills training.

It was assumed in early economic theories, reflecting the context – i.e., the secondary sector of the economy was producing much more than the tertiary sector was able to produce at the time in most countries – to be a fungible resource, homogeneous, and easily interchangeable, and it was referred to simply as workforce or labor, one of three factors of production (the others being land, and assumed-interchangeable assets of money and physical equipment). Just as land became recognized as natural capital and an asset in itself, human factors of production were raised from this simple mechanistic analysis to human capital. In modern technical financial analysis, the term &quot;balanced growth&quot; refers to the goal of equal growth of both aggregate human capabilities and physical assets that produce goods and services.

The assumption that labor or workforces could be easily modelled in aggregate began to be challenged in 1950s when the tertiary sector, which demanded creativity, begun to produce more than the secondary sector was producing at the time in the most developed countries in the world. Accordingly, much more attention was paid to factors that led to success versus failure where human management was concerned. The role of leadership, talent, even celebrity was explored.

Today, most theories attempt to break down human capital into one or more components for analysis. Most commonly, Emotional capital is the set of resources (the personal and social emotional competencies) that is inherent to the person, useful for personal, professional and organizational development, and participates to social cohesion and has personal, economic and social returns (Gendron, 2004, 2008). Social capital, the sum of social bonds and relationships, has come to be recognized, along with many synonyms such as goodwill or brand value or social cohesion or social resilience and related concepts like celebrity or , as distinct from the talent that an individual (such as an athlete has uniquely) has developed that cannot be passed on to others regardless of effort, and those aspects that can be transferred or taught: instructional capital. Less commonly, some analyses conflate good instructions for health with health itself, or good knowledge management habits or systems with the instructions they compile and manage, or the &quot;intellectual capital&quot; of teams – a reflection of their social and instructional capacities, with some assumptions about their individual uniqueness in the context in which they work. In general, these analyses acknowledge that individual trained bodies, teachable ideas or skills, and social influence or persuasion power, are different.

Management accounting is often concerned with questions of how to model human beings as a capital asset. However it is broken down or defined,
human capital is vitally important for an organization&#x27;s success (Crook et al., 2011); human capital increases through education and experience. Human capital is also important for the success of cities and regions: a 2012 study examined how the production of university degrees and R&amp;D activities of educational institutions are related to the human capital of metropolitan areas in which they are located.

In 2010, the OECD encouraged the governments of advanced economies to embrace policies to increase innovation and knowledge in products and services as an economical path to continued prosperity. International policies also often address human capital flight, which is the loss of talented or trained persons from a country that invested in them, to another country which benefits from their arrival without investing in them.

==Measurement of human capital==
===World Economic Forum Global Human Capital Index===
Since 2012 the World Economic Forum has annually published its Global Human Capital Report, which includes the Global Human Capital Index (GHCI). In the 2017 edition, 130 countries are ranked from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) according to the quality of their investments in human capital. Norway is at the top, with 77.12.

===World Bank Human Capital Index===

In October 2018, the World Bank published the Human Capital Index (HCI) as a measurement of economic success. The Index ranks countries according to how much is invested in education and health care for young people. The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report on &quot;The Changing Nature of Work&quot; showcases the Index and explains its importance given the impact of technology on labor markets and the future of work. One of the central innovations of the World Bank Human Capital Index was the inclusion and harmonization of learning data across 164 countries. This introduced a measure of human capital which directly accounts for the knowledge and skills acquired from schooling, rather than using schooling alone, now widely recognized to be an incomplete proxy. The learning outcomes data, methodology, and applications to the human capital literature underlying this effort were published in &quot;Nature&quot;.

;Human Capital Index ranking (top 50 countries)
===Other methods===
A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by &quot;The Lancet&quot; in September 2018. Finland had the highest level of expected human capital: 28·4 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. Niger had the lowest at less than 1·6 years.

Measuring the human capital index of individual firms is also possible: a survey is made on issues like training or compensation, and a value between 0 (worst) and 100 (best) is obtained. Enterprises which rank high are shown to add value to shareholders.

=== Human capital management ===

Human capital management (HCM) is the term used to describe workforce practices and resources that focus on maximizing needed skills through the recruitment, training, and development of employees. Departments and software applications responsible for HCM often manage tasks that include administrative support, reporting and analytics, education and training, and hiring and recruitment.

==Cumulative growth==
Human capital is distinctly different from the tangible monetary capital due to the extraordinary characteristic of human capital to grow cumulatively over a long period of time. The growth of tangible monetary capital is not always linear due to the shocks of business cycles. During the period of prosperity, monetary capital grows at relatively higher rate while during the period of recession and depression, there is deceleration of monetary capital. On the other hand, human capital has uniformly rising rate of growth over a long period of time because the foundation of this human capital is laid down by the educational and health inputs. The current generation is qualitatively developed by the effective inputs of education and health. The future generation is more benefited by the advanced research in the field of education and health, undertaken by the current generation. Therefore, the educational and health inputs create more productive impacts upon the future generation and the future generation becomes superior to the current generation. In other words, the productive capacity of future generation increases more than that of current generation. Therefore, rate of human capital formation in the future generation happens to be more than the rate of human capital formation in the current generation. This is the cumulative growth of human capital formation generated by superior quality of manpower in the succeeding generation as compared to the preceding generation.

==Intangibility and portability==
Human capital is an intangible asset, and it is not owned by the firm that employs it and is generally not fungible. Specifically, individuals arrive at 9am and leave at 5pm (in the conventional office model) taking most of their knowledge and relationships with them.

Human capital when viewed from a time perspective consumes time in one of these key activities:

# Knowledge (activities involving one employee),
# Collaboration (activities involving more than 1 employee),
# Processes (activities specifically focused on the knowledge and collaborative activities generated by organizational structure – such as silo impacts, internal politics, etc.) and
# Absence (annual leave, sick leave, holidays, etc.).

Despite the lack of formal ownership, firms can and do gain from high levels of training, in part because it creates a corporate culture or vocabulary teams use to create cohesion.

In recent economic writings the concept of firm-specific human capital, which includes those social relationships, individual instincts, and instructional details that are of value within one firm (but not in general), appears by way of explaining some labour mobility issues and such phenomena as golden handcuffs. Workers can be more valuable where they are simply for having acquired this knowledge, these skills and these instincts. Accordingly, the firm gains for their unwillingness to leave and market talents elsewhere.

==Marxist analysis==
In some way, the idea of &quot;human capital&quot; is similar to Karl Marx&#x27;s concept of labor power: he thought in capitalism workers sold their labor power in order to receive income (wages and salaries). But long before Mincer or Becker wrote, Marx pointed to &quot;two disagreeably frustrating facts&quot; with theories that equate wages or salaries with the interest on human capital.

# The worker must actually &quot;work&quot;, exert their mind and body, to earn this &quot;interest.&quot; Marx strongly distinguished between one&#x27;s &quot;capacity&quot; to work, labor power, and the activity of working.
# A free worker cannot sell his human capital in one go; it is far from being a liquid asset, even more illiquid than shares and land. He does not sell his skills, but contracts to utilize those skills, in the same way that an industrialist sells his produce, not his machinery. The exception here are slaves, whose human capital can be sold, though the slave does not earn an income himself.

An employer must be receiving a profit from his operations, so that workers must be producing what Marx described as surplus-value, i.e., doing work beyond that necessary to maintain their labor power. Though having &quot;human capital&quot; gives workers some benefits, they are still dependent on the owners of non-human wealth for their livelihood.

The term appears in Marx&#x27;s article in the &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot; &quot;The Emancipation Question,&quot; January 17 and 22, 1859, although there the term is used to describe humans who act like a capital to the producers, rather than in the modern sense of &quot;knowledge capital&quot; endowed to or acquired by humans.

Neo-Marxist economists have argued that education leads to higher wages not by increasing human capital, but rather by making workers more compliant and reliable in a corporate environment. The reasoning of which being that higher education creates the illusion of a meritocracy, thus justifying economic inequality to the benefit of capitalists, regardless of whether the educated human capital actually provides additional labor value.

==Risk==
When human capital is assessed by activity-based costing via time allocations it becomes possible to assess human capital risk. Human capital risks can be identified if HR processes in organizations are studied in detail. Human capital risk occurs when the organization operates below attainable operational excellence levels. For example, if a firm could reasonably reduce errors and rework (the process component of human capital) from 10,000 hours per annum to 2,000 hours with attainable technology, the difference of 8,000 hours is human capital risk. When wage costs are applied to this difference (the 8,000 hours) it becomes possible to financially value human capital risk within an organizational perspective.

Risk accumulates in four primary categories:
# Absence activities (activities related to employees not showing up for work such as sick leave, industrial action, etc.). Unavoidable absence is referred to as Statutory Absence. All other categories of absence are termed &quot;Controllable Absence&quot;;
# Collaborative activities are related to the expenditure of time between more than one employee within an organizational context. Examples include: meetings, phone calls, instructor led training, etc.;
# Knowledge Activities are related to time expenditures by a single person and include finding/retrieving information, research, email, messaging, blogging, information analysis, etc.; and
# Process activities are knowledge and collaborative activities that result due to organizational context such as errors/rework, manual data transformation, stress, politics, etc.

==Corporate management==
In corporate management, human capital is one of the three primary components of intellectual capital (which, in addition to tangible assets, comprise the entire value of a company). Human capital is the value that the employees of a business provide through the application of skills, know-how and expertise. It is an organization&#x27;s combined human capability for solving business problems. Human capital is inherent in people and cannot be owned by an organization. Therefore, human capital leaves an organization when people leave. Human capital also encompasses how effectively an organization uses its people resources as measured by creativity and innovation. A company&#x27;s reputation as an employer affects the human capital it draws.

==Criticism==
Some labor economists have criticized the Chicago-school theory, claiming that it tries to explain all differences in wages and salaries in terms of human capital. One of the leading alternatives, advanced by Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz, is &quot;signaling theory&quot;. According to signaling theory, education does not lead to increased human capital, but rather acts as a mechanism by which workers with superior innate abilities can signal those abilities to prospective employers and so gain above average wages.

The concept of human capital can be infinitely elastic, including unmeasurable variables such as personal character or connections with insiders (via family or fraternity). This theory has had a significant share of study in the field proving that wages can be higher for employees on aspects other than human capital. Some variables that have been identified in the literature of the past few decades include, gender and nativity wage differentials, discrimination in the work place, and socioeconomic status.

The prestige of a credential may be as important as the knowledge gained in determining the value of an education. This points to the existence of market imperfections such as non-competing groups and labor-market segmentation. In segmented labor markets, the &quot;return on human capital&quot; differs between comparably skilled labor-market groups or segments.

Following Becker, the human capital literature often distinguishes between &quot;specific&quot; and &quot;general&quot; human capital. Specific human capital refers to skills or knowledge that is useful only to a single employer or industry, whereas general human capital (such as literacy) is useful to all employers. Economists view firm-specific human capital as risky, since firm closure or industry decline leads to skills that cannot be transferred (the evidence on the quantitative importance of firm specific capital is unresolved).

Human capital is central to debates about welfare, education, health care, and retirement.

In 2004, &quot;human capital&quot; () was named the German Un-Word of the Year by a jury of linguistic scholars, who considered the term inappropriate and inhumane, as individuals would be degraded and their abilities classified according to economically relevant quantities.

&quot;Human capital&quot; is often confused with human development. The UN suggests &quot;Human development denotes both the process of widening people&#x27;s choices and improving their well-being&quot;. The UN Human Development indices suggest that human capital is merely a means to the end of human development: &quot;Theories of human capital formation and human resource development view human beings as means to increased income and wealth rather than as ends. These theories are concerned with human beings as inputs to increasing production&quot;.

<doc id="45806" wikidata="Q188676" url="?curid=45806" title="Garuda">
<text>Garuda (; ; Vedic Sanskrit: , ) is a Hindu deity who is primarily depicted as the mount (&quot;vahana&quot;) of the Hindu god Vishnu. This divine creature is mentioned in the Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain faiths. Garuda is also the half-brother of the Devas, Gandharvas, Daityas, Danavas, Nāgas, Vanara and Yakshas. He is the son of the sage Kashyapa and Vinata. He is the younger brother of Aruna, the charioteer of the Sun. Garuda is mentioned in several other texts such as the Puranas and the Vedas.

Garuda is described as the king of the birds and a kite-like figure. He is shown either in a zoomorphic form (a giant bird with partially open wings) or an anthropomorphic form (a man with wings and some ornithic features). Garuda is generally portrayed as a protector with the power to swiftly travel anywhere, ever vigilant and an enemy of every serpent. He is also known as Tarkshya and Vainateya.

Garuda is a part of state insignia of India, Indonesia and Thailand. Both Indonesia and Thailand have Garuda as their coat of arms, the Indian Army uses the Garuda on their Guards Brigade Regimental Insignia. The Indian Air Force named their special operations unit after him as the Garud Commando Force. It is often associated with the Greater adjutant stork (&quot;Leptoptilos dubius&quot;).

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, is a divine eagle-like sun bird and the king of birds. A &quot;Garutman&quot; is mentioned in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; who is described as celestial deva with wings. The &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; embedded inside the &quot;Yajurveda&quot; text mentions Garuda as the personification of courage. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Garutman is stated to be same as Garuda, then described as the one who is fast, who can shapeshift into any form and enter anywhere. He is a powerful creature in the epics, whose wing flapping can stop the spinning of heaven, earth and hell. He is described to be the vehicle mount of the Hindu god Vishnu, and typically they are shown together. He is the younger brother of Aruna, who is a charioteer of the sun god, Surya.

According to George Williams, Garuda has roots in the verb &quot;gri&quot;, or speak. He is a metaphor in the Vedic literature for &quot;Rik&quot; (rhythms), &quot;Saman&quot; (sounds), &quot;Yajna&quot; (sacrifices), and the &quot;atman&quot; (Self, deepest level of consciousness). In the Puranas, states Williams, Garuda becomes a literal embodiment of the idea, and the Self who attached to and inseparable from the Supreme Self (Vishnu). Though Garuda is an essential part of the Vaishnavism, he also features prominently in Shaivism, Shaiva texts such as the &quot;Garuda Tantra&quot; and &quot;Kirana Tantra&quot;, and Shiva temples as a bird and as a metaphor of &quot;atman&quot;.

===Iconography===

The Hindu texts on Garuda iconography vary in their details. If in the bird form, he is eagle-like, typically with the wings slightly open as if ready and willing to fly wherever he needs to. In part human-form, he may have an eagle-like nose, beak or legs, his eyes are open and big, his body is the color of emerald, and his wings are golden-yellow. He may be shown with either two or four hands. If he is not carrying Vishnu, he holds a jar of &quot;amrita&quot; (immortality nectar) in one hand in the rear and an umbrella in the other, while the front pair of hands are in &quot;anjali&quot; (namaste) posture. If he is carrying Vishnu, the rear hands provide the support for Vishnu&#x27;s feet.

According to the text &quot;Silparatna&quot;, states Rao, Garuda is best depicted with only two hands and with four bands of colours: &quot;golden yellow colour from feet to knees, white from knees to the navel, scarlet from navel to neck, and black above the neck&quot;. His hands, recommends the text, should be in &quot;abhaya&quot; (nothing to fear) posture. In &quot;Sritatvanidhi&quot; text, the recommended iconography for Garuda is a kneeling figure, who wears one or more serpents, pointed bird-beak like nose, his two hands in &quot;namaste&quot; posture. This style is commonly found in Hindu temples dedicated to Vishnu.

In some iconography, Garuda carries Vishnu and his two consorts by his side: Lakshmi and Bhumi.

Garuda iconography is found in early temples of India, such as on the underside of the eave at Cave 3 entrance of the Badami cave temples (6th-century).

===Beliefs===

Garuda&#x27;s mythology is linked to that of Aruna, the charioteer of the Hindu sun god Surya. Both Aruna and Garuda developed from an egg. According to one version related by George Williams, Kashyapa Prajapati&#x27;s two wives Vinata and Kadru wanted to have children, and Kashyapa granted each of them a boon. Kadru asked for one thousand Nāga sons, while Vinata asked for just two, but each an equal to all of Kadru&#x27;s thousand sons. Kashyapa blessed them, and then retreated to a forest to meditate. Later, Kadru gave birth to one thousand eggs, while Vinata gave birth to two eggs. After incubating them for five hundred years, Kadru&#x27;s eggs hatched and out came her 1,000 sons. Vinata, eager for her own sons, impatiently broke one of her eggs. From this egg emerged the partially formed Aruna, looking radiant and reddish as the morning sun, but not as bright as the midday sun as he was promised to be. Aruna chided his mother Vinata for her impatience, and warned her to not break open the second egg, cursing her to be a slave until his brother rescued her. Aruna then left to become the charioteer of Surya, the sun god.
Vinata waited, and after many years, the second egg hatched and Garuda was born. After losing a bet to Kadru through trickery, Vinata was forced to become her slave. Garuda later asked his brothers to free his mother from her slavery, to which they demanded Amrita from heaven. Garuda waged a war against gods with his extraordinary might and abilities, and defeated all of them, including Indra. He then took Indra&#x27;s nectar vessel and flew back to earth. Vishnu then came to Garuda, and asked him to be his ride, to which he agreed. Indra requested that Garuda not give the Amrita to the Nagas though, as it would bring great trouble later, so they forged a plan. Upon reaching his brothers Garuda placed the vessel before them, and asked them to first purify themselves before drinking. Meanwhile, Jayanta (the son of Indra) stole the vessel back. On returning, the nagas were all devoured by Garuda.

Some myths present Garuda as so massive that he can block out the sun. The text &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; is named after him.

Garuda is presented in the Mahabharata as one who eats snake meat, such as the story about him planning to kill and eat Sumukha snake, where Indra intervenes. Garuda in anger, vaunt about his feats and compares himself to Indra&#x27;s equal. Vishnu teaches a lesson to Garuda and cured his pride on might. Garudas are also a race of birds who devour snakes in the epic.

The &quot;Suparṇākhyāna&quot;, a late Vedic period poem considered to be among the &quot;earliest traces of epic poetry in India,&quot; relates the legend of Garuda, and provides the basis for a later, expanded version which appears within the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;.

===Symbolism===
Garuda&#x27;s links to Vishnu – the Hindu god who fights injustice and destroys evil in his various avatars to preserve dharma – have made him an iconic symbol of kings&#x27; duty and power, an insignia of royalty or dharma. His eagle-like form is shown either alone or with Vishnu, signifying divine approval of the power of the state. He is found on the faces of many early Hindu kingdom coins with this symbolism, either as a single-headed bird or a three-headed bird that watches all sides.

Throughout the Mahabharata, Garuda is invoked as a symbol of impetuous violent force, speed, and martial prowess. Powerful warriors advancing rapidly on doomed foes are likened to Garuda swooping down on a serpent. Defeated warriors are like snakes beaten down by Garuda. The Mahabharata character Drona uses a military formation named after Garuda. Krishna carries the image of Garuda on his banner.

=== Temples ===

Though Garuda stautues and iconography can be seen in many Vishnu temples, there are very few temples dedicated to Garuda as a deity in India.

==== Vellamassery Garuda Temple, Triprangode, Tirur, Malappuram, Kerala ====
A 1800 year old ancient kavu dedicated to Garuda, it is famous in the state for the alleviation of &#x27;sarpa dosham&#x27;. Nearby the main temple is a rare subsidiary shrine dedicated to the Kurma avatar of Lord Vishnu.

==== Chemmanadu Sri Krishna Garuda Mahavishnu Temple, Tiruvaniyoor, Ernakulam, Kerala ====
This temple was believed to have been constructed after Garuda himself manifested in eagle form in front of the devotees during the consecration ceremony. Lord Vishnu is present in his Mohini &quot;swaroopam&quot; in this temple, adding to its rarity.

==== Garuda Swamy Temple, Koladevi, Mulbagal, Kolar, Karnataka ====

==Buddhism==

Garuda, also referred to as &quot;Garula&quot;, are golden-winged birds in Buddhist texts. Under the Buddhist concept of &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, they are one of the Aṣṭagatyaḥ, the eight classes of inhuman beings. In Buddhist art, they are shown as sitting and listening to the sermons of the Buddha. They are enemies of the Nāgas (snakes) and are sometimes depicted with a serpent held between their claws. Like the Hindu art, both zoomorphic (giant eagle-like bird) and partially anthropomorphic (part bird, part human) iconography is common across Buddhist traditions.
In Buddhism, the Garuda (Sanskrit; Pāli: ) are enormous predatory birds with a wingspan of 330 yojanas. They are described as beings with intelligence and social organisation. They are also sometimes known as (Sanskrit; Pāli: ), meaning &quot;well-winged, having good wings&quot;. Like the Nāgas, they combine the characteristics of animals and divine beings, and may be considered to be among the lowest of the devas. The Garudas have kings and cities, and at least some of them have the magical power of changing into human form when they wish to have dealings with people. On some occasions Garuda kings have had romances with human women in this form. Their dwellings are in groves of the &quot;simbalī&quot;, or silk-cotton tree.

Jataka stories describe them to be residents of Nagadipa or Seruma.

The Garuda are enemies to the nāga, a race of intelligent serpent- or dragon-like beings, whom they hunt. The Garudas at one time caught the nāgas by seizing them by their heads; but the nāgas learned that by swallowing large stones, they could make themselves too heavy to be carried by the Garudas, wearing them out and killing them from exhaustion. This secret was divulged to one of the Garudas by the ascetic Karambiya, who taught him how to seize a nāga by the tail and force him to vomit up his stone (Pandara Jātaka, J.518).

The Garudas were among the beings appointed by Śakra to guard Mount Sumeru and the  heaven from the attacks of the asuras.
In the Maha-samaya Sutta (Digha Nikaya 20), the Buddha is shown making temporary peace between the Nagas and the Garudas.

In the Qing dynasty fiction &quot;The Story of Yue Fei&quot; (1684), Garuda sits at the head of the Buddha&#x27;s throne. But when a celestial bat (an embodiment of the Aquarius constellation) flatulates during the Buddha&#x27;s expounding of the Lotus Sutra, Garuda kills her and is exiled from paradise. He is later reborn as Song dynasty General Yue Fei. The bat is reborn as Lady Wang, wife of the traitor Prime Minister Qin Hui, and is instrumental in formulating the &quot;Eastern Window&quot; plot that leads to Yue&#x27;s eventual political execution. &quot;The Story of Yue Fei&quot; plays on the legendary animosity between Garuda and the Nagas when the celestial bird-born Yue Fei defeats a magic serpent who transforms into the unearthly spear he uses throughout his military career. Literary critic C. T. Hsia explains the reason why Qian Cai, the book&#x27;s author, linked Yue with Garuda is because of the homology in their Chinese names. Yue Fei&#x27;s courtesy name is Pengju (). A Peng () is a giant mythological bird likened to the Middle Eastern roc. Garuda&#x27;s Chinese name is Great Peng, the Golden-Winged Illumination King ().

==Jainism==

The Garuda is a yaksha or guardian for Shantinatha in Jain iconography and mythology. Jain iconography shows Garuda as a human figure with wings and a strand-circle.

==As a cultural and national symbol==

In India and the rest of Southeast Asia the eagle symbolism is represented by Garuda, a large bird with eagle-like features that appears in both Hindu and Buddhist epic as the vahana (vehicle) of the god Vishnu. Garuda became the national emblem of Thailand and Indonesia; Thailand&#x27;s Garuda is rendered in a more traditional anthropomorphic style, while that of Indonesia is rendered in heraldic style with traits similar to the real Javan hawk-eagle.

<doc id="45807" wikidata="Q1897397" url="?curid=45807" title="Financial capital">
<text>Financial capital (also simply known as capital or equity in finance, accounting and economics) is any economic resource measured in terms of money used by entrepreneurs and businesses to buy what they need to make their products or to provide their services to the sector of the economy upon which their operation is based (e.g. retail, corporate, investment banking). In other words, financial capital is internal retained earnings generated by the entity or funds provided by lenders (and investors) to businesses in order to purchase real capital equipment or services for producing new goods or services.

In contrast, real capital (or economic capital) comprises physical goods that assist in the production of other goods and services (e.g. shovels for gravediggers, sewing machines for tailors, or machinery and tooling for factories).

== IFRS concepts of capital maintenance ==
&quot;Financial capital&quot; generally refers to saved-up financial wealth, especially that used in order to start or maintain a business. A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial reports. Under a financial concept of capital, such as &quot;invested money&quot; or &quot;invested purchasing power&quot;, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity. Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day.

Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units or units of constant purchasing power. Accordingly, there are three concepts of capital maintenance in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS):

# Physical capital maintenance;
# Financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units; and
# Financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power.

Financial capital is provided by lenders for a price: interest. Also see time value of money for a more detailed description of how financial capital may be analyzed. Furthermore, financial capital, is any liquid medium or mechanism that represents wealth, or other styles of capital. It is, however, usually purchasing power in the form of money available for the production or purchasing of goods, etcetera. Capital can also be obtained by producing more than what is immediately required and saving the surplus.

Financial capital can also be in the form of purchasable items such as computers or books that can contribute directly or indirectly to obtaining various other types of capital. Financial capital has been subcategorized by some academics as economic or &quot;productive capital&quot; necessary for operations, signaling capital which signals a company&#x27;s financial strength to shareholders, and regulatory capital which fulfills capital requirements.

==Sources of capital==
* Long term – usually above 7 years
** Share Capital
** Mortgage loan
** Retained Profit
** Venture capital
** Debenture
** Project finance
* Medium term – usually between 2 and 7 years
** Term Loans
** Revenue-based financing
** Leasing
** Hire Purchase
* Short term – usually under 2 years
** Bank Overdraft
** Trade credit
** Deferred Expenses
** Factoring

===Capital market===
* Long-term funds are bought and sold:
** Shares
** Debenture
** Long-term loans, often with a mortgage bond as security
** Reserve funds
** Euro Bonds

===Money market===
* Financial institutions can use short-term savings to lend out in the form of short-term loans:
** Commercial paper
** Credit on open account
** Bank overdraft
** Short-term loans
** Bills of exchange
** Factoring of debtors

==Differences between shares and debentures==
* Shareholders are effectively owners; debenture-holders are creditors.
* Shareholders may vote at AGMs (Annual General Meetings, alternatively Annual Shareholder Meetings) and be elected as directors; debenture-holders may not vote at AGMs or be elected as directors.
* Shareholders receive profit in the form of dividends; debenture-holders receive a fixed rate of interest.
* If there is no profit, the shareholder does not receive a dividend; interest is paid to debenture-holders regardless of whether or not a profit has been made.
*In case of dissolution the firm&#x27;s debenture holders are paid first, before shareholders.

==Types of capital==
===Fixed capital===
Fixed capital is money firms use to purchase assets that will remain permanently in the business and help it make a profit. Factors determining fixed capital requirements:
* Nature of business
* Size of business
* Stage of development
* Capital invested by the owners
* location of that area

===Working capital===

Firms use working capital to run their business. For example, money that they use to buy stock, pay expenses and finance credit. Factors determining working capital requirements:
* Size of business
* Stage of development
* Time of production
* Rate of stock turnover ratio
* Buying and selling terms
* Seasonal consumption
* Seasonal product
*profit level
*growth and expansion
*production cycle
*general nature of business
*business cycle
*business policies
*Debt ratio

===Own and borrowed capital===
Capital contributed by the owner or entrepreneur of a business, and obtained, for example, by means of savings or inheritance, is known as own capital or equity, whereas that which is granted by another person or institution via debt instruments is called borrowed capital, and this must usually be paid back with interest. The ratio between debt and equity is named leverage. It has to be optimized as a high leverage can bring a higher profit but create solvency risk.

Borrowed capital is capital that the business borrows from institutions or people, and includes debentures:
*Redeemable debentures
*Irredeemable debentures
* Debentures to bearer
* Ordinary debentures
* bonds
* deposits
*loans

Own capital is private capital that owners of a business (shareholders and partners, for example) provide, sometimes called owners equity. The ownership interest is typically represented in preferred shares, and may be of various types, for example:
* Preference shares/hybrid source of finance
** Ordinary preference shares
** Cumulative preference shares
** Participating preference shares
* Ordinary shares
* Bonus shares
* Founders&#x27; shares

These typically have preference over the common shares. This means the payments made to the shareholders are first paid to the preference shareholder(s) and then to the equity shareholders.

== Instruments ==
A contract regarding any combination of capital assets is called a financial instrument, and may serve as a 
*medium of exchange,
*standard of deferred payment,
*unit of account, or
*store of value.

Most indigenous forms of money (wampum, shells, tally sticks and such) and the modern fiat money are only a &quot;symbolic&quot; storage of value and not a real storage of value like commodity money.

=== Valuation ===
Normally, a financial instrument is priced accordingly to the perception by capital market players of its expected return and risk. Unit of account functions may come into question if valuations of complex financial instruments vary drastically based on timing. The &quot;book value&quot;, &quot;mark-to-market&quot; and &quot;mark-to-future&quot; conventions are three different approaches to reconciling financial capital value units of account.

==Issuing and trading==

Like money, financial instruments may be &quot;backed&quot; by state military fiat, credit (i.e. social capital held by banks and their depositors), or precious metals resources. Governments generally closely control the supply of it and usually require some &quot;reserve&quot; be held by institutions granting credit. Trading between various national currency instruments is conducted on a money market. Such trading reveals differences in probability of debt collection or store of value function of that currency, as assigned by traders.

When in forms other than money, financial capital may be traded on bond markets or reinsurance markets with varying degrees of trust in the social capital (not just credits) of bond-issuers, insurers, and others who issue and trade in financial instruments. When payment is deferred on any such instrument, typically an interest rate is higher than the standard interest rates paid by banks, or charged by the central bank on its money. Often such instruments are called fixed-income instruments if they have reliable payment schedules associated with the uniform rate of interest. A variable-rate instrument, such as many consumer mortgages, will reflect the standard rate for deferred payment set by the central bank prime rate, increasing it by some fixed percentage. Other instruments, such as citizen entitlements, e.g. &quot;U.S. Social Security&quot;, or other pensions, may be indexed to the rate of inflation, to provide a reliable value stream.

Typically commodity markets depend on politics that affect international trade, e.g. boycotts and embargoes, or factors that influence natural capital, e.g. weather that affects food crops. Meanwhile, stock markets are more influenced by trust in corporate leaders, i.e. individual capital, by consumers, i.e. social capital or &quot;brand capital&quot; (in some analyses), and internal organizational efficiency, i.e. instructional capital and infrastructural capital. Some enterprises issue instruments to specifically track one limited division or brand. &quot;Financial futures&quot;, &quot;Short selling&quot; and &quot;financial options&quot; apply to these markets, and are typically pure financial bets on outcomes, rather than being a direct representation of any underlying asset.

==Broadening the notion==

The relationship between financial capital, money, and all other styles of capital, especially human capital or labor, is assumed in central bank policy and regulations regarding instruments as above. Such relationships and policies are characterized by a political economy – feudalist, socialist, capitalist, green, anarchist or otherwise. In effect, the means of money supply and other regulations on financial capital represent the economic sense of the value system of the society itself, as they determine the allocation of labor in that society.

So, for instance, rules for increasing or reducing the money supply based on perceived inflation, or on measuring well-being, reflect some such values, reflect the importance of using (all forms of) financial capital as a stable store of value. If this is very important, inflation control is key - any amount of money inflation reduces the value of financial capital with respect to all other types.

If, however, the medium of exchange function is more critical, new money may be more freely issued regardless of impact on either inflation or well-being.

==Economic role==
Socialism, capitalism, feudalism, anarchism, and other civic theories take markedly different views of the role of financial capital in social life, and propose various political restrictions to deal with that.

Financial capitalism is the production of profit from the manipulation of financial capital. It is held in contrast to industrial capitalism, where profit is made from the manufacture of goods.

===Marxist perspectives===

It is common in Marxist theory to refer to the role of finance capital as the determining and ruling class interest in capitalist society, particularly in the latter stages.

<text>Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm ( ) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, a road network. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.
Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm finds the shortest path from a given source node to every other node. It can be used to find the shortest path to a specific destination node, by terminating the algorithm after determining the shortest path to the destination node. For example, if the nodes of the graph represent cities, and the costs of edges represent the average distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, then Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities. A common application of shortest path algorithms is network routing protocols, most notably IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First). It is also employed as a subroutine in algorithms such as Johnson&#x27;s algorithm.

The algorithm uses a min-priority queue data structure for selecting the shortest paths known so far. Before more advanced priority queue structures were discovered, Dijkstra&#x27;s original algorithm ran in formula_1 time, where formula_2 is the number of nodes. proposed a Fibonacci heap priority queue to optimize the running time complexity to formula_3. This is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights. However, specialized cases (such as bounded/integer weights, directed acyclic graphs etc.) can be improved further. If preprocessing is allowed, algorithms such as contraction hierarchies can be up to seven orders of magnitude faster.

Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm is commonly used on graphs where the edge weights are positive integers or real numbers. It can be generalized to any graph where the edge weights are partially ordered, provided the subsequent labels (a subsequent label is produced when traversing an edge) are monotonically non-decreasing.

In many fields, particularly artificial intelligence, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm or a variant offers a uniform cost search and is formulated as an instance of the more general idea of best-first search.

== History ==

Dijkstra thought about the shortest path problem while working as a programmer at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam in 1956. He wanted to demonstrate the capabilities of the new ARMAC computer. His objective was to choose a problem and a computer solution that non-computing people could understand. He designed the shortest path algorithm and later implemented it for ARMAC for a slightly simplified transportation map of 64 cities in the Netherlands (he limited it to 64, so that 6 bits would be sufficient to encode the city number). A year later, he came across another problem advanced by hardware engineers working on the institute&#x27;s next computer: minimize the amount of wire needed to connect the pins on the machine&#x27;s back panel. As a solution, he re-discovered Prim&#x27;s minimal spanning tree algorithm (known earlier to Jarník, and also rediscovered by Prim). Dijkstra published the algorithm in 1959, two years after Prim and 29 years after Jarník.

== Algorithm ==

The algorithm requires a starting node, and node &quot;N,&quot; with a distance between the starting node and &quot;N&quot;. Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm starts with infinite distances and tries to improve them step by step:

# Create a set of all unvisited nodes: the unvisited set.
# Assign to every node a distance from start value: for the starting node, it is zero, and for all other nodes, it is infinity, since initially no path is known to these nodes. During execution, the distance of a node &quot;N&quot; is the length of the shortest path discovered so far between the starting node and &quot;N&quot;.
# From the unvisited set, select the current node to be the one with the smallest (finite) distance; initially, this is the starting node (distance zero). If the unvisited set is empty, or contains only nodes with infinite distance (which are unreachable), then the algorithm terminates by skipping to step 6. If the only concern is the path to a target node, the algorithm terminates once the current node is the target node. Otherwise, the algorithm continues.
# For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and update their distances through the current node; compare the newly calculated distance to the one currently assigned to the neighbor and assign the smaller one to it. For example, if the current node &quot;A&quot; is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with its neighbor &quot;B&quot; has length 2, then the distance to &quot;B&quot; through &quot;A&quot; is 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8, then update it to 8 (the path to B through A is shorter). Otherwise, keep its current distance (the path to B through A is not the shortest).
# After considering all of the current node&#x27;s unvisited neighbors, the current node is removed from the unvisited set. Thus a visited node is never rechecked, which is correct because the distance recorded on the current node is minimal (as ensured in step 3), and thus final. Repeat from step 3.
# Once the loop exits (steps 3–5), every visited node contains its shortest distance from the starting node.

== Description ==

The shortest path between two intersections on a city map can be found by this algorithm using pencil and paper. Every intersection is listed on a separate line: one is the starting point and is labeled (given a distance of) 0. Every other intersection is initially labeled with a distance of infinity. This is done to note that no path to these intersections has yet been established. At each iteration one intersection becomes the current intersection. For the first iteration, this is the starting point.

From the current intersection, the distance to every neighbor (directly-connected) intersection is assessed by summing the label (value) of the current intersection and the distance to the neighbor and then relabeling the neighbor with the lesser of that sum and the neighbor&#x27;s existing label. I.e., the neighbor is relabeled if the path to it through the current intersection is shorter than previously assessed paths. If so, mark the road to the neighbor with an arrow pointing to it, and erase any other arrow that points to it. After the distances to each of the current intersection&#x27;s neighbors have been assessed, the current intersection is marked as visited. The unvisited intersection with the smallest label becomes the current intersection and the process repeats until all nodes with labels less than the destination&#x27;s label have been visited.

Once no unvisited nodes remain with a label smaller than the destination&#x27;s label, the remaining arrows show the shortest path.

==Pseudocode==
In the following pseudocode, is an array that contains the current distances from the to other vertices, i.e. is the current distance from the source to the vertex . The array contains pointers to previous-hop nodes on the shortest path from source to the given vertex (equivalently, it is the &quot;next-hop&quot; on the path &quot;from&quot; the given vertex &quot;to&quot; the source). The code , searches for the vertex in the vertex set that has the least value. returns the length of the edge joining (i.e. the distance between) the two neighbor-nodes and . The variable on line 14 is the length of the path from the node to the neighbor node if it were to go through . If this path is shorter than the current shortest path recorded for , then the distance of is updated to .
 1 function Dijkstra(&quot;Graph&quot;, &quot;source&quot;):
 2 
 3 for each vertex &quot;v&quot; in &quot;Graph.Vertices&quot;:
 4 dist[&quot;v&quot;] ← INFINITY
 5 prev[&quot;v&quot;] ← UNDEFINED
 6 add &quot;v&quot; to &quot;Q&quot;
 7 dist[&quot;source&quot;] ← 0
 8 
 9 while &quot;Q&quot; is not empty:
 10 &quot;u&quot; ← vertex in &quot;Q&quot; with minimum dist[u]
 11 remove u from &quot;Q&quot;
 12 
 13 for each neighbor &quot;v&quot; of &quot;u&quot; still in &quot;Q&quot;:
 14 &quot;alt&quot; ← dist[&quot;u&quot;] + Graph.Edges(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;)
 15 if &quot;alt&quot; &lt; dist[&quot;v&quot;]:
 16 dist[&quot;v&quot;] ← &quot;alt&quot;
 17 prev[&quot;v&quot;] ← &quot;u&quot;
 18
 19 return dist[], prev[]

To find the shortest path between vertices and , the search terminates after line 10 if . The shortest path from to can be obtained by reverse iteration:

 1 &quot;S&quot; ← empty sequence
 2 &quot;u&quot; ← &quot;target&quot;
 3 if prev[&quot;u&quot;] is defined or &quot;u&quot; = &quot;source&quot;: &quot;// Proceed if the vertex is reachable&quot;
 4 while &quot;u&quot; is defined: &quot;// Construct the shortest path with a stack S&quot;
 5 insert &quot;u&quot; at the beginning of &quot;S&quot; &quot;// Push the vertex onto the stack&quot;
 6 &quot;u&quot; ← prev[&quot;u&quot;] &quot;// Traverse from target to source&quot;

Now sequence is the list of vertices constituting one of the shortest paths from to , or the empty sequence if no path exists.

A more general problem is to find all the shortest paths between and (there might be several of the same length). Then instead of storing only a single node in each entry of all nodes satisfying the relaxation condition can be stored. For example, if both and connect to and they lie on different shortest paths through (because the edge cost is the same in both cases), then both and are added to . When the algorithm completes, data structure describes a graph that is a subset of the original graph with some edges removed. Its key property is that if the algorithm was run with some starting node, then every path from that node to any other node in the new graph is the shortest path between those nodes graph, and all paths of that length from the original graph are present in the new graph. Then to actually find all these shortest paths between two given nodes, a path finding algorithm on the new graph, such as depth-first search would work.

===Using a priority queue===
A min-priority queue is an abstract data type that provides 3 basic operations: , and . As mentioned earlier, using such a data structure can lead to faster computing times than using a basic queue. Notably, Fibonacci heap or Brodal queue offer optimal implementations for those 3 operations. As the algorithm is slightly different in appearance, it is mentioned here, in pseudocode as well:

 1 function Dijkstra(&quot;Graph&quot;, &quot;source&quot;):
 2 create vertex priority queue Q
 3
 4 dist[&quot;source&quot;] ← 0 &quot;// Initialization&quot;
 5 &quot;Q&quot;.add_with_priority(&quot;source&quot;, 0) &quot;// associated priority equals dist[·]&quot;
 6
 7 for each vertex &quot;v&quot; in &quot;Graph.Vertices&quot;:
 8 if &quot;v&quot; ≠ &quot;source&quot;
 9 prev[&quot;v&quot;] ← UNDEFINED &quot;// Predecessor of v&quot;
 10 dist[&quot;v&quot;] ← INFINITY &quot;// Unknown distance from source to v&quot;
 11 Q.add_with_priority(v, INFINITY)
 12
 13
 14 while &quot;Q&quot; is not empty: &quot;// The main loop&quot;
 15 &quot;u&quot; ← &quot;Q&quot;.extract_min() &quot;// Remove and return best vertex&quot;
 16 for each neighbor &quot;v&quot; of &quot;u&quot;: &quot;// Go through all v neighbors of u&quot;
 17 &quot;alt&quot; ← dist[&quot;u&quot;] + Graph.Edges(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;)
 18 if &quot;alt&quot; &lt; dist[&quot;v&quot;]:
 19 prev[&quot;v&quot;] ← &quot;u&quot;
 20 dist[&quot;v&quot;] ← &quot;alt&quot;
 21 &quot;Q&quot;.decrease_priority(&quot;v&quot;, &quot;alt&quot;)
 22
 23 return dist, prev

Instead of filling the priority queue with all nodes in the initialization phase, it is possible to initialize it to contain only &quot;source&quot;; then, inside the codice_1 block, the becomes an operation.

Yet another alternative is to add nodes unconditionally to the priority queue and to instead check after extraction (codice_2) that it isn&#x27;t revisiting, or that no shorter connection was found yet in the codice_3 block. This can be done by additionally extracting the associated priority codice_4 from the queue and only processing further codice_5 inside the codice_6 loop.

These alternatives can use entirely array-based priority queues without decrease-key functionality, which have been found to achieve even faster computing times in practice. However, the difference in performance was found to be narrower for denser graphs.

== Proof ==
To prove the correctness of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, mathematical induction can be used on the number of visited nodes.

&quot;Invariant hypothesis&quot;: For each visited node , is the shortest distance from to , and for each unvisited node , is the shortest distance from to when traveling via visited nodes only, or infinity if no such path exists. (Note: we do not assume is the actual shortest distance for unvisited nodes, while is the actual shortest distance)

=== Base case ===
The base case is when there is just one visited node, . Its distance is defined to be zero, which is the shortest distance, since negative weights are not allowed. Hence, the hypothesis holds.

=== Induction ===
Assuming that the hypothesis holds for formula_4 visited nodes, to show it holds for formula_5 nodes, let be the next visited node, i.e. the node with minimum . The claim is that is the shortest distance from to .

The proof is by contradiction. If a shorter path were available, then this shorter path either contains another unvisited node or not.

* In the former case, let be the first unvisited node on this shorter path. By induction, the shortest paths from to and through visited nodes only have costs and respectively. This means the cost of going from to via has the cost of at least + the minimal cost of going from to . As the edge costs are positive, the minimal cost of going from to is a positive number. However, is at most because otherwise w would have been picked by the priority queue instead of u. This is a contradiction, since it has already been established that + a positive number &lt; .
* In the latter case, let be the last but one node on the shortest path. That means . That is a contradiction because by the time is visited, it should have set to at most .

For all other visited nodes , the is already known to be the shortest distance from already, because of the inductive hypothesis, and these values are unchanged.

After processing , it is still true that for each unvisited node , is the shortest distance from to using visited nodes only. Any shorter path that did not use , would already have been found, and if a shorter path used it would have been updated when processing .

After all nodes are visited, the shortest path from to any node consists only of visited nodes. Therefore, is the shortest distance.

== Running time ==
Bounds of the running time of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm on a graph with edges &#x27; and vertices &#x27; can be expressed as a function of the number of edges, denoted formula_6, and the number of vertices, denoted formula_2, using big-O notation. The complexity bound depends mainly on the data structure used to represent the set &quot;. In the following, upper bounds can be simplified because formula_6 is formula_9 for any simple graph, but that simplification disregards the fact that in some problems, other upper bounds on formula_6 may hold.

For any data structure for the vertex set &quot;, the running time i s:

: formula_11

where formula_12 and formula_13 are the complexities of the &quot;decrease-key&quot; and &quot;extract-minimum&quot; operations in &quot;, respectively.

The simplest version of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm stores the vertex set &#x27; as a linked list or array, and edges as an adjacency list or matrix. In this case, extract-minimum is simply a linear search through all vertices in &#x27;, so the running time is formula_14.

For sparse graphs, that is, graphs with far fewer than formula_15 edges, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm can be implemented more efficiently by storing the graph in the form of adjacency lists and using a self-balancing binary search tree, binary heap, pairing heap, Fibonacci heap or a priority heap as a priority queue to implement extracting minimum efficiently. To perform decrease-key steps in a binary heap efficiently, it is necessary to use an auxiliary data structure that maps each vertex to its position in the heap, and to update this structure as the priority queue &quot; changes. With a self-balancing binary search tree or binary heap, the algorithm requires

: formula_16

time in the worst case; for connected graphs this time bound can be simplified to formula_17. The Fibonacci heap improves this to

: formula_18

When using binary heaps, the average case time complexity is lower than the worst-case: assuming edge costs are drawn independently from a common probability distribution, the expected number of &quot;decrease-key&quot; operations is bounded by formula_19, giving a total running time of

: formula_20

===Practical optimizations and infinite graphs===
In common presentations of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, initially all nodes are entered into the priority queue. This is, however, not necessary: the algorithm can start with a priority queue that contains only one item, and insert new items as they are discovered (instead of doing a decrease-key, check whether the key is in the queue; if it is, decrease its key, otherwise insert it). This variant has the same worst-case bounds as the common variant, but maintains a smaller priority queue in practice, speeding up queue operations.

Moreover, not inserting all nodes in a graph makes it possible to extend the algorithm to find the shortest path from a single source to the closest of a set of target nodes on infinite graphs or those too large to represent in memory. The resulting algorithm is called &quot;uniform-cost search&quot; (UCS) in the artificial intelligence literature and can be expressed in pseudocode as
 procedure uniform_cost_search(start) is
 node ← start
 frontier ← priority queue containing node only
 expanded ← empty set
 do
 if frontier is empty then
 return failure
 node ← frontier.pop()
 if node is a goal state then
 return solution(node)
 expanded.add(node)
 for each of node&#x27;s neighbors &quot;n&quot; do
 if &quot;n&quot; is not in expanded and not in frontier then
 frontier.add(&quot;n&quot;)
 else if &quot;n&quot; is in frontier with higher cost
 replace existing node with &quot;n&quot;

Its complexity can be expressed in an alternative way for very large graphs: when is the length of the shortest path from the start node to any node satisfying the &quot;goal&quot; predicate, each edge has cost at least &#x27;, and the number of neighbors per node is bounded by &#x27;, then the algorithm&#x27;s worst-case time and space complexity are both in .

Further optimizations for the single-target case include bidirectional variants, goal-directed variants such as the A* algorithm (see ), graph pruning to determine which nodes are likely to form the middle segment of shortest paths (reach-based routing), and hierarchical decompositions of the input graph that reduce routing to connecting &#x27; and &#x27; to their respective &quot;transit nodes&quot; followed by shortest-path computation between these transit nodes using a &quot;highway&quot;. Combinations of such techniques may be needed for optimal practical performance on specific problems.

=== Optimality for comparison-sorting by distance ===
As well as simply computing distances and paths, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm can be used to sort vertices by their distances from a given starting vertex.
In 2023, Haeupler, Rozhoň, Tětek, Hladík, and Tarjan (one of the inventors of the 1984 heap), proved that, for this sorting problem on a positively-weighted directed graph, a version of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm with a special heap data structure has a runtime and number of comparisons that is within a constant factor of optimal among comparison-based algorithms for the same sorting problem on the same graph and starting vertex but with variable edge weights. To achieve this, they use a comparison-based heap whose cost of returning/removing the minimum element from the heap is logarithmic in the number of elements inserted after it rather than in the number of elements in the heap.

===Specialized variants===
When arc weights are small integers (bounded by a parameter formula_21), specialized queues can be used for increased speed. The first algorithm of this type was Dial&#x27;s algorithm for graphs with positive integer edge weights, which uses a bucket queue to obtain a running time formula_22. The use of a Van Emde Boas tree as the priority queue brings the complexity to formula_23 . Another interesting variant based on a combination of a new radix heap and the well-known Fibonacci heap runs in time formula_24 . Finally, the best algorithms in this special case run in formula_25 time and formula_26 time.

== Related problems and algorithms ==
Dijkstra&#x27;s original algorithm can be extended with modifications. For example, sometimes it is desirable to present solutions which are less than mathematically optimal. To obtain a ranked list of less-than-optimal solutions, the optimal solution is first calculated. A single edge appearing in the optimal solution is removed from the graph, and the optimum solution to this new graph is calculated. Each edge of the original solution is suppressed in turn and a new shortest-path calculated. The secondary solutions are then ranked and presented after the first optimal solution.

Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm is usually the working principle behind link-state routing protocols. OSPF and IS-IS are the most common.

Unlike Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, the Bellman–Ford algorithm can be used on graphs with negative edge weights, as long as the graph contains no negative cycle reachable from the source vertex &quot;s&quot;. The presence of such cycles means that no shortest path can be found, since the label becomes lower each time the cycle is traversed. (This statement assumes that a &quot;path&quot; is allowed to repeat vertices. In graph theory that is normally not allowed. In theoretical computer science it often is allowed.) It is possible to adapt Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm to handle negative weights by combining it with the Bellman-Ford algorithm (to remove negative edges and detect negative cycles): Johnson&#x27;s algorithm.

The A* algorithm is a generalization of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm that reduces the size of the subgraph that must be explored, if additional information is available that provides a lower bound on the distance to the target.

The process that underlies Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm is similar to the greedy process used in Prim&#x27;s algorithm. Prim&#x27;s purpose is to find a minimum spanning tree that connects all nodes in the graph; Dijkstra is concerned with only two nodes. Prim&#x27;s does not evaluate the total weight of the path from the starting node, only the individual edges.

Breadth-first search can be viewed as a special-case of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm on unweighted graphs, where the priority queue degenerates into a FIFO queue.

The fast marching method can be viewed as a continuous version of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm which computes the geodesic distance on a triangle mesh.

=== Dynamic programming perspective ===
From a dynamic programming point of view, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm is a successive approximation scheme that solves the dynamic programming functional equation for the shortest path problem by the Reaching method.

In fact, Dijkstra&#x27;s explanation of the logic behind the algorithm: 

is a paraphrasing of Bellman&#x27;s Principle of Optimality in the context of the shortest path problem.

<text>A subwoofer (or sub) is a loudspeaker designed to reproduce low-pitched audio frequencies, known as bass and sub-bass, that are lower in frequency than those which can be (optimally) generated by a woofer. The typical frequency range that is covered by a subwoofer is about 20–200 Hz for consumer products, below 100 Hz for professional live sound, and below 80 Hz in THX-certified systems. Thus, one or more subwoofers are important for high-quality sound reproduction as they are responsible for the lowest two to three octaves of the ten octaves that are audible. This very low-frequency (VLF) range reproduces the natural fundamental tones of the bass drum, electric bass, double bass, grand piano, contrabassoon, tuba, in addition to thunder, gunshots, explosions, etc.

Subwoofers are never used alone, as they are intended to substitute the VLF sounds of &quot;main&quot; loudspeakers that cover the higher frequency bands. VLF and higher-frequency signals are sent separately to the subwoofer(s) and the mains by a &quot;crossover&quot; network, typically using active electronics, including digital signal processing (DSP). Additionally, subwoofers are fed their own low-frequency effects (LFE) signals that are reproduced at 10 dB higher than standard peak level.

Subwoofers can be positioned more favorably than the main speakers&#x27; woofers in the typical listening room acoustic, as the very low frequencies they reproduce are nearly omnidirectional and their direction largely indiscernible. However, much digitally recorded content contains lifelike binaural cues that human hearing may be able to detect in the VLF range, reproduced by a stereo crossover and two or more subwoofers. Subwoofers are not acceptable to all audiophiles, likely due to distortion artifacts produced by the subwoofer driver after the crossover and at frequencies above the crossover.

While the term &quot;subwoofer&quot; technically only refers to the speaker driver, in common parlance, the term often refers to a subwoofer driver mounted in a speaker enclosure (cabinet), often with a built-in amplifier.

Subwoofers are made up of one or more woofers mounted in a loudspeaker enclosure—often made of wood—capable of withstanding air pressure while resisting deformation. Subwoofer enclosures come in a variety of designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, tapped horn, transmission line, bandpass or isobaric designs. Each design has unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, low-frequency range, loudness, cabinet size, and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure, but they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.

The first home audio subwoofers were developed in the 1960s to add bass response to home stereo systems. Subwoofers came into greater popular consciousness in the 1970s with the introduction of Sensurround in movies such as &quot;Earthquake&quot;, which produced loud low-frequency sounds through large subwoofers. With the advent of the compact cassette and the compact disc in the 1980s, the reproduction of deep &quot;and&quot; loud bass was no longer limited by the ability of a phonograph record stylus to track a groove, and producers could add more low-frequency content to recordings. As well, during the 1990s, DVDs were increasingly recorded with &quot;surround sound&quot; processes that included a low-frequency effects (LFE) channel, which could be heard using the subwoofer in home-cinema (also called &quot;home theater&quot;) systems. During the 1990s, subwoofers also became increasingly popular in home stereo systems, custom car audio installations, and in PA systems. By the 2000s, subwoofers became almost universal in sound reinforcement systems in nightclubs and concert venues.

Unlike a system&#x27;s main loudspeakers, subwoofers can be positioned more optimally in a listening room&#x27;s acoustic. However, subwoofers are not universally accepted by audiophiles amid complaints of the difficulty of &quot;splicing&quot; the sound with that of the main speakers around the crossover frequency. This is largely due to the subwoofer driver&#x27;s non-linearity producing harmonic and intermodulation distortion products well above the crossover frequency, and into the range where human hearing can &quot;localize&quot; them, wrecking the stereo &quot;image&quot;.

==History==
===1920s to 1950s precursors===
From about 1900 to the 1950s, the &quot;lowest frequency in practical use&quot; in recordings, broadcasting and music playback was 100 Hz. When sound was developed for motion pictures, the basic RCA sound system was a single 8-inch (20 cm) speaker mounted in straight horn, an approach which was deemed unsatisfactory by Hollywood decisionmakers, who hired Western Electric engineers to develop a better speaker system. The early Western Electric experiments added a set of 18-inch drivers for the low end in a large, open-backed baffle (extending the range down to 50 Hz) and a high-frequency unit, but MGM was not pleased with the sound of the three-way system, as they had concerns about the delay between the different drivers.

In 1933, the head of MGM&#x27;s sound department, Douglas Shearer, worked with John Hilliard and James B. Lansing (who would later found Altec Lansing in 1941 and JBL in 1946) to develop a new speaker system that used a two-way enclosure with a W-shaped bass horn that could go as low as 40 Hz. The Shearing-Lansing 500-A ended up being used in &quot;screening rooms, dubbing theaters, and early sound reinforcement&quot;. In the late 1930s, Lansing created a smaller two-way speaker with a woofer in a vented enclosure, which he called the Iconic system; it was used as a studio monitor and in high-end home hi-fi set-ups.

During the 1940s swing era, to get deeper bass, &quot;pipelike opening[s]&quot; were cut into speaker enclosures, creating bass reflex enclosures, as it was found that even a fairly inexpensive speaker enclosure, once modified in this way, could &quot;transmit the driving power of a heavy...drumbeat—and sometimes not much else—to a crowded dancefloor.&quot; Prior to the development of the first subwoofers, woofers were used to reproduce bass frequencies, usually with a crossover point set at 500 Hz and a loudspeaker in an infinite baffle or in professional sound applications, a &quot;hybrid horn-loaded&quot; bass reflex enclosure (such as the 15-inch Altec Lansing A-7 enclosure nicknamed the &quot;Voice of the Theater&quot;, which was introduced in 1946). In the mid-1950s, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences selected the &quot;big, boxy&quot; Altec A-7 as the industry standard for movie sound reproduction in theaters.

===1960s: first subwoofers===
In September 1964, Raymon Dones, of El Cerrito, California, received the first patent for a subwoofer specifically designed to augment omnidirectionally the low frequency range of modern stereo systems (US patent 3150739). It was able to reproduce distortion-free low frequencies down to 15 cycles per second (15 Hz). A specific objective of Dones&#x27;s invention was to provide portable sound enclosures capable of high fidelity reproduction of low frequency sound waves without giving an audible indication of the direction from which they emanated. Dones&#x27;s loudspeaker was marketed in the US under the trade name &quot;The Octavium&quot; from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s. The Octavium was utilized by several recording artists of that era, most notably the Grateful Dead, bassist Monk Montgomery, bassist Nathan East, and the Pointer Sisters. The Octavium speaker and Dones&#x27;s subwoofer technology were also utilized, in a few select theaters, to reproduce low pitch frequencies for the 1974 blockbuster movie &quot;Earthquake&quot;. During the late 1960s, Dones&#x27;s Octavium was favorably reviewed by audiophile publications including &quot;Hi-Fi News&quot; and &quot;Audio Magazine&quot;.

Another early subwoofer enclosure made for home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell&#x27;s garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin-Vega 18-inch (45 cm) driver to provide servo control information to the amplifier, and it was offered for sale at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at &quot;Stereo Review&quot;. In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The subwoofer was reviewed positively in &quot;Stereophile&quot; magazine&#x27;s winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 received very good reviews in 1970 from &quot;High Fidelity&quot; magazine.

Another of the early subwoofers was developed during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, the former president of the Miller &amp; Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel&#x27;s business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store&#x27;s high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity&#x27;s full range electrostatic speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.

===1970s to 1980s===
The first use of a subwoofer in a recording session was in 1973 for mixing the Steely Dan album &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot;, when recording engineer Roger Nichols arranged for Kreisel to bring a prototype of his subwoofer to Village Recorders. Further design modifications were made by Kreisel over the next ten years, and in the 1970s and 1980s by engineer John P. D&#x27;Arcy; record producer Daniel Levitin served as a consultant and &quot;golden ears&quot; for the design of the crossover network (used to partition the frequency spectrum so that the subwoofer would not attempt to reproduce frequencies too high for its effective range, and so that the main speakers would not need to handle frequencies too low for their effective range). In 1976, Kreisel created the first satellite speakers and subwoofer system, named &quot;David and Goliath&quot;.

Subwoofers received a great deal of publicity in 1974 with the movie &quot;Earthquake&quot;, which was released in Sensurround. Initially installed in 17 U.S. theaters, the Cerwin-Vega &quot;Sensurround&quot; system used large subwoofers that were driven by racks of 500 watt amplifiers, triggered by control tones printed on one of the audio tracks on the film. Four of the subwoofers were positioned in front of the audience under (or behind) the film screen and two more were placed together at the rear of the audience on a platform. Powerful noise energy and loud rumbling in the range of 17 to 120 Hz were generated at the level of 110–120 decibels of sound pressure level, abbreviated dB(SPL). The new low frequency entertainment method helped the film become a box office success. More Sensurround systems were assembled and installed. By 1976, there were almost 300 Sensurround systems leapfrogging through select theaters. Other films to use the effect include the WW II naval battle epic &quot;Midway&quot; in 1976 and &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; in 1977.

For owners of 33 rpm LPs and 45 rpm singles, loud &quot;and&quot; deep bass was limited by the ability of the phonograph record stylus to track the groove. While some hi-fi aficionados had solved the problem by using other playback sources, such as reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature, with the popular introduction of the compact cassette in the late 1960s it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings. By the mid-1970s, 12-inch vinyl singles, which allowed for &quot;more bass volume&quot;, were used to record disco, reggae, dub and hip-hop tracks; dance club DJs played these records in clubs with subwoofers to achieve &quot;physical and emotional&quot; reactions from dancers.

In the early 1970s, David Mancuso hired sound engineer Alex Rosner to design additional subwoofers for his disco dance events, along with &quot;tweeter arrays&quot; to &quot;boost the treble and bass at opportune moments&quot; at his private, underground parties at The Loft. The demand for sub-bass sound reinforcement in the 1970s was driven by the important role of &quot;powerful bass drum&quot; in disco, as compared with rock and pop; to provide this deeper range, a third crossover point from 40 to 120 Hz (centering on 80 Hz) was added. The Paradise Garage discotheque in New York City, which operated from 1977 to 1987, had &quot;custom designed &#x27;sub-bass&#x27; speakers&quot; developed by Alex Rosner&#x27;s disciple, sound engineer Richard (&quot;Dick&quot;) Long that were called &quot;Levan Horns&quot; (in honor of resident DJ Larry Levan).

By the end of the 1970s, subwoofers were used in dance venue sound systems to enable the playing of &quot;[b]ass-heavy dance music&quot; that we &quot;do not &#x27;hear&#x27; with our ears but with our entire body&quot;. At the club, Long used four Levan bass horns, one in each corner of the dancefloor, to create a &quot;haptic and tactile quality&quot; in the sub-bass that you could feel in your body. To overcome the lack of sub-bass frequencies on 1970s disco records (sub-bass frequencies below 60 Hz were removed during mastering), Long added a DBX 100 &quot;Boom Box&quot; subharmonic pitch generator into his system to synthesize 25 to 50 Hz sub-bass from the 50 to 100 Hz bass on the records.

By the later 1970s, disco club sound engineers were using the same large Cerwin-Vega Sensurround-style folded horn subwoofers that were used in &quot;Earthquake&quot; and similar movies in dance club system installations. In the early 1980s, Long designed a sound system for the Warehouse dance club, with &quot;huge stacks of subwoofers&quot; which created &quot;deep and intense&quot; bass frequencies that &quot;pound[ed] through your system&quot; and &quot;entire body&quot;, enabling clubgoers to &quot;viscerally experience&quot; the DJs&#x27; house music mixes.

In Jamaica in the 1970s and 1980s, sound engineers for reggae sound systems began creating &quot;heavily customized&quot; subwoofer enclosures by adding foam and tuning the cabinets to achieve &quot;rich and articulate speaker output below 100 Hz&quot;. The sound engineers who developed the &quot;bass-heavy signature sound&quot; of sound reinforcement systems have been called &quot;deserving as much credit for the sound of Jamaican music as their better-known music producer cousins&quot;. The sound engineers for Stone Love Movement (a sound system crew), for example, modified folded horn subwoofers they imported from the US to get more of a bass reflex sound that suited local tone preferences for dancehall audiences, as the unmodified folded horn was found to be &quot;too aggressive&quot; sounding and &quot;not deep enough for Jamaican listeners&quot;.

In sound system culture, there are both &quot;low and high bass bins&quot; in &quot;towering piles&quot; that are &quot;delivered in large trucks&quot; and set up by a crew of &quot;box boys&quot;, and then positioned and adjusted by the sound engineer in a process known as &quot;stringing up&quot;, all to create the &quot;sound of reggae music you can literally feel as it comes off these big speakers&quot;. Sound system crews hold &#x27;sound clash&#x27; competitions, where each sound system is set up and then the two crews try to outdo each other, both in terms of loudness and the &quot;bass it produced&quot;.
In the 1980s, the Bose Acoustimass AM-5 became a popular subwoofer and small high-range satellite speaker system for home listening. Steve Feinstein stated that with the AM-5, the system&#x27;s &quot;appearance mattered as much as, if not more than, great sound&quot; to consumers of this era, as it was considered to be a &quot;cool&quot; look. The success of the AM-5 led to other makers launching subwoofer-satellite speaker systems, including Boston Acoustics Sub Sat 6 and 7, and the Cambridge SoundWorks Ensemble systems (by Kloss). Claims that these sub-satellite systems showed manufacturers and designers that home-cinema systems with a hidden subwoofer could be &quot;feasible and workable in a normal living room&quot; for mainstream consumers. Despite criticism of the AM-5 from audio experts, regarding a lack of bass range below 60 Hz, an &quot;acoustic hole&quot; in the 120 to 200 Hz range and a lack of upper range above 13 kHz for the satellites, the AM-5 system represented 30% of the US speaker market in the early 1990s.

In the 1980s, Origin Acoustics developed the first residential in-wall subwoofer named Composer. It used an aluminum 10-inch (25.4 cm) driver and a foam-lined enclosure designed to be mounted directly into wall studs during the construction of a new home. The frequency response for the Composer is 30 to 250 Hz.

===1990s to 2010s===
While in the 1960s and 1970s deep bass speakers were once an exotic commodity owned by audiophiles, by the mid-1990s they were much more popular and widely used, with different sizes and capabilities of sound output. An example of 1990s subwoofer use in sound reinforcement is the Ministry of Sound dance club which opened in 1991 in London. The dancefloor&#x27;s sound system was based on Richard Long&#x27;s design at Paradise Garage. The club spent about £500,000 on a sound system that used Martin Audio components in custom-built cabinets, including twelve 21&quot; 9,500 watt active subwoofers, twelve 18-inch subwoofers and twelve Martin Audio W8C mid-high speakers.

The popularity of the CD made it possible to add more low frequency content to recordings and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.

In 2015, Damon Krukowski wrote an article entitled &quot;Drop the Bass: A Case Against Subwoofers&quot; for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; magazine, based on his performing experience with Galaxie 500; he argues that &quot;for certain styles of music&quot;, especially acoustic music genres, &quot;these low-end behemoths are actually ruining our listening experience&quot; by reducing the clarity of the low end. In 2015, John Hunter from REL Acoustics stated that audiophiles tend to &quot;have a love/hate relationship with subwoofers&quot; because most subs have &quot;awful&quot;, &quot;entry-level&quot; sound quality and they are used in an &quot;inappropriate way&quot;, without integrating the bass seamlessly.

In 2018, some electronic dance music (EDM) sound systems for venues that play hardcore bass have multiple subwoofer arrays to deal with mid-bass (80–140 Hz), bass (40–80 Hz), and &quot;infra-bass&quot; (20–40 Hz).

==Construction and features==
Loudspeaker and enclosure design

Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) typically between 8-inch (20 cm) and 21-inch (53 cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, and single prototype subwoofers as large as 60-inch (152 cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10 cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home-cinema subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends on the design of the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25 cm, 30 cm, 38 cm, and 45 cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53 cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.

The reference efficiency of a loudspeaker system in its passband is given by:

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the speed of sound in air and the variables are Thiele/Small parameters: formula_3 is the resonance frequency of the driver, formula_4 is the volume of air having the same acoustic compliance as the driver suspension, and formula_5 is the driver formula_6 at formula_3 considering the electrical DC resistance of the driver voice coil. Deep low-frequency extension is a common goal for a subwoofer and small box volumes are also considered desirable, to save space and reduce the size for ease of transportation (in the case of sound reinforcement and DJ subwoofers). Hofmann&#x27;s &quot;Iron Law&quot; therefore mandates low efficiency under those constraints, and indeed most subwoofers require considerable power, much more than other individual drivers.

So, for the example of a closed-box loudspeaker system, the box volume formula_8 to achieve a given total formula_6 of the system formula_10 is proportional to formula_4:

: formula_12

where formula_13 is the system compliance ratio given by the ratio of the driver compliance and the enclosure compliance, which can be written as:

: formula_14

where formula_15 is the system resonance frequency.

Therefore, a decrease in box volume (i.e., a smaller speaker cabinet) and the same formula_16 will decrease the efficiency of the subwoofer. The normalized half-power frequency of a closed-box loudspeaker system is given by:

: formula_17

Here we note that if formula_18, then formula_19.

As the efficiency is proportional to formula_20, small improvements in low-frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase the efficiency of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements. Vented-box loudspeaker systems have a maximum theoretical efficiency that is 2.9 dB greater than that of the closed-box system.

Subwoofers are typically constructed by mounting one or more woofers in a cabinet of medium-density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, fiberglass, aluminum or other stiff materials. Because of the high air pressure that they produce in the cabinet, subwoofer enclosures often require internal bracing to distribute the resulting forces.

Subwoofers have been designed using a number of enclosure approaches: bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, tapped horn, transmission line and bandpass. Each enclosure type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency increase, bass extension, cabinet size, distortion, and cost.

Multiple enclosure types may even be combined in a single design, such as in computer audio with the subwoofer design of the Labtec LCS-2424 (later acquired by Logitech and used for their Z340/Z540/Z640/Z3/Z4), which is a (primitive) passive radiator bandpass enclosure with a bass reflex dividing chamber.

While not necessarily an enclosure type, isobaric (such as push-pull) coupled loading of two drivers has sometimes been used in subwoofer products of computer, home cinema and sound reinforcement class, and also DIY versions in automotive applications, to provide relatively deep bass for their size. Self-contained &quot;isobaric-like&quot; driver assemblies have been manufactured since the 2010s.

The smallest subwoofers are typically those designed for desktop multimedia systems. The largest common subwoofer enclosures are those used for concert sound reinforcement systems or dance club sound systems. An example of a large concert subwoofer enclosure is the 1980s-era Electro-Voice MT-4 &quot;Bass Cube&quot; system, which used four 18-inch (45 cm) drivers. An example of a subwoofer that uses a bass horn is the Bassmaxx B-Two, which loads an 18-inch (45 cm) driver onto an long folded horn. Folded horn-type subwoofers can typically produce a deeper range with greater efficiency than the same driver in an enclosure that lacks a horn. However, folded horn cabinets are typically larger and heavier than front-firing enclosures, so folded horns are less commonly used. Some experimental fixed-installation subwoofer horns have been constructed using brick and concrete to produce a very long horn that allows a very deep sub-bass extension.

Subwoofer output level can be increased by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs necessarily involve tradeoffs and compromises. Hofmann&#x27;s Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume (as in size) and to the cube of its cutoff frequency, that is how low in pitch it will go) applies to subwoofers just as it does to all loudspeakers. Thus, a subwoofer enclosure designer aiming at the deepest-pitched bass will probably have to consider using a large enclosure size; a subwoofer enclosure designer instructed to create the smallest possible cabinet (to make transportation easier) will need to compromise how low in pitch their cabinet will go.

===Frequency range and frequency response===
The frequency response specification of a speaker describes the range of frequencies or musical tones a speaker can reproduce, measured in hertz (Hz). The typical frequency range for a subwoofer is between 20–200 Hz. Professional concert sound system subwoofers typically operate below 100 Hz, and THX-certified systems operate below 80 Hz. Subwoofers vary in terms of the range of pitches that they can reproduce, depending on a number of factors such as the size of the cabinet and the construction and design of the enclosure and driver(s). Specifications of frequency response depend wholly for relevance on an accompanying amplitude value—measurements taken with a wider amplitude tolerance will give any loudspeaker a wider frequency response. For example, the JBL 4688 TCB Subwoofer System, a now-discontinued system which was designed for movie theaters, had a frequency response of 23–350 Hz when measured within a 10-decibel boundary (0 dB to −10 dB) and a narrower frequency response of 28–120 Hz when measured within a 6-decibel boundary (±3 dB).

Subwoofers also vary in regard to the sound pressure levels achievable and the distortion levels that they produce over their range. Some subwoofers, such as The Abyss by MartinLogan for example, can reproduce pitches down to around 18 Hz (which is about the pitch of the lowest rumbling notes on a huge pipe organ with 16 Hz bass pipes) to 120 Hz (±3 dB). Nevertheless, even though the Abyss subwoofer can go down to 18 Hz, its lowest frequency and maximum SPL with a limit of 10% distortion is 35.5 Hz and 79.8 dB at 2 meters. This means that a person choosing a subwoofer needs to consider more than just the lowest pitch that the subwoofer can reproduce.

===Amplification===
&#x27;Active subwoofers&#x27; include their own dedicated amplifiers within the cabinet. Some also include user-adjustable equalization that allows boosted or reduced output at particular frequencies; these vary from a simple &quot;boost&quot; switch, to fully parametric equalizers meant for detailed speaker and room correction. Some such systems are even supplied with a calibrated microphone to measure the subwoofer&#x27;s in-room response, so the automatic equalizer can correct the combination of subwoofer, subwoofer location, and room response to minimize the effects of room modes and improve low-frequency performance.

&#x27;Passive subwoofers&#x27; have a subwoofer driver and enclosure, but they do not include an amplifier. They sometimes incorporate internal passive crossovers, with the filter frequency determined at the factory. These are generally used with third-party power amplifiers, taking their inputs from active crossovers earlier in the signal chain. Inexpensive home-theater-in-a-box (HTIB) packages often come with a passive subwoofer cabinet that is amplified by the multi-channel amplifier. While few high-end home-cinema systems use passive subwoofers, this format is still popular in the professional sound industry.

===Equalization===
Equalization can be used to adjust the in-room response of a subwoofer system. Designers of active subwoofers sometimes include a degree of corrective equalization to compensate for known performance issues (e.g. a steeper than desired low end roll-off rate). In addition, many amplifiers include an adjustable low-pass filter, which prevents undesired higher frequencies from reaching the subwoofer driver. For example, if a listener&#x27;s main speakers are usable down to 80 Hz, then the subwoofer filter can be set so the subwoofer only works below 80 Hz. Typical filters involve some overlap in frequency ranges; a steep 4th-order 24 dB/octave low-pass filter is generally desired for subwoofers in order to minimize the overlap region. The filter section may also include a high-pass &quot;infrasonic&quot; or &quot;subsonic&quot; filter, which prevents the subwoofer driver from attempting to reproduce frequencies below its safe capabilities. Setting an infrasonic filter is important on bass reflex subwoofer cabinets, as the bass reflex design tends to create the risk of cone overexcursion at pitches below those of the port tuning, which can cause distortion and damage the subwoofer driver. For example, in a ported subwoofer enclosure tuned to 30 Hz, one may wish to filter out pitches below the tuning frequency; that is, frequencies below 30 Hz.

Some systems use parametric equalization in an attempt to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations, in part because of the resonance (i.e. standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.

===Phase control===
Changing the relative phase of the subwoofer with respect to the woofers in other speakers may or may not help to minimize unwanted destructive acoustic interference in the frequency region covered by both the subwoofer and the main speakers. It may not help at all frequencies, and may create further problems with frequency response, but even so is generally provided as an adjustment for subwoofer amplifiers. Phase control circuits may be a simple polarity reversal switch or a more complex continuously variable circuit.

Continuously variable phase control circuits are common in subwoofer amplifiers, and may be found in crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e. at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home-cinema receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.

The subwoofer phase can still be changed by moving the subwoofer closer to or further from the listening position, however this may not be always practical.

===Servo subwoofers===
Some active subwoofers use a servo feedback mechanism based on cone movement that modifies the signal sent to the voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from a comparison of the input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.

Servo-controlled subwoofers are not the same as Tom Danley&#x27;s ServoDrive subwoofers, whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The ServoDrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates power compression, the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil. This feature allows high-power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its ServoDrive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.

==Applications==

===Home audio===
The use of a subwoofer augments the bass capability of the main speakers, and allows them to be smaller without sacrificing low-frequency capability. A subwoofer does not necessarily provide superior bass performance in comparison to large conventional loudspeakers on ordinary music recordings due to the typical lack of very low frequency content on such sources. However, there are recordings with substantial low-frequency content that most conventional loudspeakers are ill-equipped to handle without the help of a subwoofer, especially at high playback levels, such as music for pipe organs with 32&#x27; (9.75 meter) bass pipes (16 Hz), very large bass drums on symphony orchestra recordings and electronic music with extremely low synth bass parts, such as bass tests or bass songs.

Frequencies which are sufficiently low are not easily localized by humans, hence many stereo and multichannel audio systems feature only one subwoofer channel and a single subwoofer can be placed off-center without affecting the perceived sound stage, since the sound that it produces will be difficult to localize. The intention in a system with a subwoofer is often to use small main speakers (of which there are two for stereo and five or more for surround sound or movie tracks) and to hide the subwoofer elsewhere (e.g. behind furniture or under a table), or to augment an existing speaker to save it from having to handle woofer-destroying low frequencies at high levels. This effect is possible only if the subwoofer is restricted to quite low frequencies, usually taken to be, say, 100 Hz and below—still less localization is possible if restricted to even lower maximum frequencies. Higher upper limits for the subwoofer (e.g. 125 Hz) are much more easily localized, making a single subwoofer impractical. Home-cinema systems typically use one subwoofer cabinet (the &quot;1&quot; in 5.1 surround sound). However, to &quot;improve bass distribution in a room that has multiple seating locations, and prevent nulls with weakened bass response, some home-cinema enthusiasts use 5.2- or 7.2- or 9.2-channel surround sound systems with two subwoofer cabinets in the same room.

Some users add a subwoofer because high levels of low-frequency bass are desired, even beyond what is in the original recording, as in the case of house music enthusiasts. Thus, subwoofers may be part of a package that includes satellite speakers, may be purchased separately, or may be built into the same cabinet as a conventional speaker system. For instance, some floor-standing tower speakers include a subwoofer driver in the lower portion of the same cabinet. Physical separation of subwoofer and satellite speakers not only allows placement in an inconspicuous location, but since sub-bass frequencies are particularly sensitive to room location (due to room resonances and reverberation &#x27;modes&#x27;), the best position for the subwoofer is not likely to be where the satellite speakers are located.

Higher end home-cinema systems and enthusiasts may also opt to take low-frequency bass reproduction even further by incorporating two or more external subwoofers. Having two subwoofers placed around the room ensures even distribution of bass, reducing subwoofer localization and pressurizing the room with low frequency notes that can be felt, just like the cinemas.

For greatest efficiency and best coupling to the room&#x27;s air volume, subwoofers can be placed in a corner of the room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener&#x27;s left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low-frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it is possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel&#x27;s speaker is out of phase with another.

The physically separate subwoofer/satellite arrangement, with small satellite speakers and a large subwoofer cabinet that can be hidden behind furniture, has been popularized by multimedia speaker systems such as Bose Acoustimass Home Entertainment Systems, Polk Audio RM2008 Series and Klipsch Audio Technologies ProMedia, among many others.

Low-cost HTIB systems advertise their integration and simplicity. Particularly among lower cost HTIB systems and with boomboxes, however, the inclusion of a subwoofer may be little more than a marketing technique. It is unlikely that a small woofer in an inexpensively-built compact plastic cabinet will have better bass performance than well-designed conventional (and typically larger) speakers in a plywood or MDF cabinet. Mere use of the term &quot;subwoofer&quot; is no guarantee of good or extended bass performance. Many multimedia subwoofers might better be termed &quot;mid bass cabinets&quot; (60 to 160 Hz), as they are too small to produce deep bass in the 30 to 59 Hz range.

Further, poorly-designed systems often leave everything below about 120 Hz (or even higher) to the subwoofer, meaning that the subwoofer handles frequencies which the ear can use for sound source localization, thus introducing an undesirable subwoofer &quot;localization effect&quot;. This is usually due to poor crossover designs or choices (too high a crossover point or insufficient crossover slope) used in many computer and home-cinema systems; localization also comes from port noise and from typically large amounts of harmonic distortion in the subwoofer design. Home subwoofers sold individually usually include crossover circuitry to assist with the integration of the subwoofer into an existing system.

===Car audio===
Automobiles are not well suited for the &quot;hidden&quot; subwoofer approach due to space limitations in the passenger compartments. It is not possible, in most circumstances, to fit such large drivers and enclosures into doors or dashboards, so subwoofers are installed in the trunk or back seat space. Some car audio enthusiasts compete to produce very high sound pressure levels in the confines of their vehicle&#x27;s cabin; sometimes dangerously high sound pressure levels. The &quot;SPL wars&quot; have drawn much attention to subwoofers in general, but subjective competitions in sound quality (&quot;SQ&quot;) have not gained equivalent popularity. Top SPL cars are not able to play normal music, or perhaps even to drive normally as they are designed solely for competition. Many non-competition subwoofers are also capable of generating high levels in cars due to the small volume of a typical car interior. High sound levels can cause hearing loss and tinnitus if one is exposed to them for an extended period of time.

In the 2000s, several car audio manufacturers produced subwoofers using non-circular shapes, including Boston Acoustic, Kicker, Sony, Bazooka, and X-Tant. Other major car audio manufacturers like Rockford Fosgate did not follow suit since non-circular subwoofer shapes typically carry some sort of distortion penalties. In situations of limited mounting space they provide a greater cone area and assuming all other variables are constant, greater maximum output. An important factor in the &quot;square sub vs round sub&quot; argument is the effects of the enclosure used. In a sealed enclosure, the maximum displacement is determined by

formula_21

where
* formula_22 is the volume of displacement (in m3)
* formula_23 is the amount of linear excursion the speaker is mechanically capable of (in m)
* formula_24 is the cone area of the subwoofer (in m2).
These are some of the Thiele/Small parameters which can either be measured or found with the driver specifications.

===Cinema sound===
After the introduction of Sensurround, movie theater owners began installing permanent subwoofer systems. Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track was a six-channel film sound format introduced in 1976 that used two subwoofer channels for stereo reproduction of low frequencies. In 1981, Altec introduced a dedicated cinema subwoofer model tuned to around 20 Hz: the 8182. Starting in 1983, THX certification of the cinema sound experience quantified the parameters of good audio for watching films, including requirements for subwoofer performance levels and enough isolation from outside sounds so that noise did not interfere with the listening experience. This helped provide guidelines for multiplex cinema owners who wanted to isolate each individual cinema from its neighbors, even as louder subwoofers were making isolation more difficult. Specific cinema subwoofer models appeared from JBL, Electro-Voice, Eastern Acoustic Works, Kintek, Meyer Sound Laboratories and BGW Systems in the early 1990s. In 1992, Dolby Digital&#x27;s six-channel film sound format incorporated a single LFE channel, the &quot;point one&quot; in 5.1 surround sound systems.

Tom Horral, a Boston-based acoustician, blames complaints about modern movies being too loud on subwoofers. He says that before subwoofers made it possible to have loud, relatively undistorted bass, movie sound levels were limited by the distortion in less capable systems at low frequency and high levels.
===Sound reinforcement===
Professional audio subwoofers used in rock concerts in stadia, DJ performances at dance music venues (e.g. electronic dance music) and similar events must be capable of very high bass output levels, at very low frequencies, with low distortion. This is reflected in the design attention given in the 2010s to the subwoofer applications for sound reinforcement, public address systems, dance club systems and concert systems. Cerwin-Vega states that when a subwoofer cabinet is added to an existing full-range speaker system, this is advantageous, as it moves the &quot;...lowest frequencies from your main [full-range] PA speakers&quot; thus &quot;...eliminat[ing] a large amount of the excess work that your main top [full-range] box was trying to reproduce. As a result, your main [full-range] cabinets will run more efficiently and at higher volumes.&quot; A different argument for adding subwoofer cabinets is that they may increase the &quot;level of clarity&quot; and &quot;perceived loudness&quot; of an overall PA system, even if the SPL is not actually increased. &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; states that adding a subwoofer enclosure to a full-range system will reduce &quot;cone excursion&quot;, thus lowering distortion, leading to an overall cleaner sound.

Consumer applications (as in home use) are considerably less demanding due to much smaller listening space and lower playback levels. Subwoofers are now almost universal in professional sound applications such as live concert sound, churches, nightclubs, and theme parks. Movie theaters certified to the THX standard for playback always include high-capability subwoofers. Some professional applications require subwoofers designed for very high sound levels, using multiple 12-, 15-, 18- or 21-inch drivers (30 cm, 40 cm, 45 cm, 53 cm respectively). Drivers as small as 10-inch (25 cm) are occasionally used, generally in horn-loaded enclosures.

The number of subwoofer enclosures used in a concert depends on a number of factors, including the size of the venue, whether it is indoors or outdoors, the amount of low-frequency content in the band&#x27;s sound, the desired volume of the concert, and the design and construction of the enclosures (e.g. direct-radiating versus horn-loaded). A tiny coffeehouse may only need a single 10-inch subwoofer cabinet to augment the bass provided by the full-range speakers. A small bar may use one or two direct-radiating 15-inch (40 cm) subwoofer cabinets. A large dance club may have a row of four or five twin 18-inch (45 cm) subwoofer cabinets, or more. In the largest stadium venues, there may be a very large number of subwoofer enclosures. For example, the 2009–2010 U2 360° Tour used 24 Clair Brothers BT-218 subwoofers (a double 18-inch (45 cm) box) around the perimeter of the central circular stage, and 72 proprietary Clair Brothers cardioid S4 subwoofers placed underneath the ring-shaped &quot;B&quot; stage which encircles the central main stage.

The main speakers may be &#x27;flown&#x27; from the ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and &#x27;flying points&#x27; (i.e. attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. One of the reasons subwoofers may be installed on the ground is that on-the-ground installation can increase the bass performance, particularly if the subwoofer is placed in the corner of a room (conversely, if a subwoofer cabinet is perceived as too loud, alternatives to on-the-ground or in-corner installation may be considered). There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45 cm) cabinets in a typical rock concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of medium-density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28 mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20 mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.

Touring subwoofer cabinets are typically designed with features that facilitate moving the enclosure (e.g. wheels, a &quot;towel bar&quot; handle and recessed handles), a protective grille for the speaker (in direct radiating-style cabinets), metal or plastic protection for the cabinets to protect the finish as the cabinets are being slid one on top of another, and hardware to facilitate stacking the cabinets (e.g. interlocking corners) and for &quot;flying&quot; the cabinets from stage rigging. In the 2000s, many small- to mid-size subwoofers designed for bands&#x27; live sound use and DJ applications are &quot;powered subs&quot;; that is, they have an integrated power amplifier. These models typically have a built-in crossover. Some models have a metal-reinforced hole in which a speaker pole can be mounted for elevating full-frequency range cabinets.

====Use in a full-range system====
In professional concert sound system design, subwoofers can be incorporated seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or mono full-range system by using an active crossover. The audio engineer typically adjusts the frequency point at which lower frequency sounds are routed to the subwoofer speaker(s), and mid-frequency and higher frequency sounds are sent to the full-range speakers. Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model. While 2010-era subwoofer cabinet manufacturers suggest placing subwoofers on either side of a stage (as implied by the inclusion of pole cups for the full-range PA cabinets), Dave Purton argues that for club gigs, having two subwoofer cabinets on either side of a stage will lead to gaps in bass coverage in the venue; he states that putting the two subwoofer cabinets together will create a more even, omnidirectional sub-bass tone.

====Aux-fed subwoofers====
Instead of being incorporated into a full-range system, concert subwoofers can be supplied with their own signal from a separate mix bus on the mixing console; often one of the auxiliary sends (&quot;aux&quot; or &quot;auxes&quot;) is used. This configuration is called &quot;aux-fed subwoofers&quot;, and has been observed to significantly reduce low-frequency &quot;muddiness&quot; that can build up in a concert sound system which has on stage a number of microphones each picking up low frequencies and each having different phase relationships of those low frequencies. The aux-fed subwoofers method greatly reduces the number of sources feeding the subwoofers to include only those instruments that have desired low-frequency information; sources such as kick drum, bass guitar, samplers and keyboard instruments. This simplifies the signal sent to the subwoofers and makes for greater clarity and low punch. Aux-fed subwoofers can even be stereo, if desired, using two auxiliary mix buses.

====Directional bass====
To keep low-frequency sound focused on the audience area and not on the stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are: music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing at the same time in different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theaters, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include: setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system. With a cardioid dispersion pattern, two end-fire subwoofers can be placed one in front of the other. The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds. The second subwoofer is delayed a precise amount corresponding to the time it takes sound to traverse the distance between speaker grilles.

=====Vertical array=====
Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a vertical array focuses the low frequencies forward to a greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low-frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.

=====Rear delay array=====
Another cardioid subwoofer array pattern can be used horizontally, one which takes few channels of processing and no change in required physical space. This method is often called &quot;cardioid subwoofer array&quot; or &quot;CSA&quot; even though the pattern of &quot;all&quot; directional subwoofer methods is cardioid. The CSA method reverses the enclosure orientation and inverts the polarity of one out of every three subwoofers across the front of the stage, and delays those enclosures for maximum cancellation of the target frequency on stage. Polarity inversion can be implemented electronically, by reversing the wiring polarity, or by physically positioning the enclosure to face rearward. This method reduces forward output relative to a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of subwoofers, but can solve problems of unwanted low-frequency energy coming into microphones on stage. Compared to the end-fire array, this method has less on-axis energy but more even pattern control throughout the audience, and more predictable cancellation rearward. The effect spans a range of slightly more than one octave.

A second method of rear delay array combines end-fire topology with polarity reversal, using two subwoofers positioned front to back, the drivers spaced one-quarter wavelength apart, the rear enclosure inverted in polarity and delayed by a few milliseconds for maximum cancellation on stage of the target frequency. This method has the least output power directed toward the audience, compared to other directional methods.
=====End-fire array=====
The end-fire subwoofer method, also called &quot;forward steered arrays&quot;, places subwoofer drivers co-axially in one or more rows, using destructive interference to reduce emissions to the sides and rear. This can be done with separate subwoofer enclosures positioned front to back with a spacing between them of one-quarter wavelength of the target frequency, the frequency that is least wanted on stage or most desired in the audience. Each row is delayed beyond the first row by an amount related to the speed of sound in air; the delay is typically a few milliseconds. The arrival time of sound energy from all the subwoofers is near-simultaneous from the audience&#x27;s perspective, but is canceled out to a large degree behind the subwoofers because of offset sound wave arrival times. Directionality of the target frequency can achieve as much as 25 dB rear attenuation, and the forward sound is coherently summed in line with the subwoofers. The positional technique of end-fire subwoofers came into widespread use in European live concert sound in 2006.

The end-fire array trades a few decibels of output power for directionality, so it requires more enclosures for the same output power as a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of enclosures. Sixteen enclosures in four rows were used in 2007 at one of the stages of the Ultra Music Festival, to reduce low-frequency interference to neighboring stages. Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it. The output pattern suffers from comb-filtering off-axis, but can be further shaped by adjusting the frequency response of each row of subwoofers.
=====Delay-shaded array=====
A long line of subwoofers placed horizontally along the front edge of the stage can be delayed such that the center subwoofers fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to &quot;their&quot; neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of the horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.

=====Directional enclosure=====
Some subwoofer enclosure designs rely on drivers facing to the sides or to the rear in order to achieve a degree of directionality. End-fire drivers can be positioned within a single enclosure that houses more than one driver.

===Variants===
Some less commonly-used bass enclosures are variants of the subwoofer enclosure&#x27;s normal range, such as the mid-bass cabinet (60–160 Hz) and the infrasonic (extra low) subwoofer (below 30 Hz).

===Enclosure designs===
Front-loaded subwoofers have one or more subwoofer speakers in a cabinet, typically with a grille to protect the speakers. In practice, many front-loaded subwoofer cabinets have a vent or port in the speaker cabinet, thus creating a bass reflex enclosure. Even though a bass reflex port or vent creates some additional phase delay, it adds SPL, which is often a key factor in PA and sound reinforcement system applications. As such, non-vented front-firing subwoofer cabinets are rare in pro audio applications.

Horn-loaded subwoofers have a subwoofer speaker that has a pathway following the loudspeaker. To save space, the pathway is often folded, so that the folded pathway will fit into a box-style cabinet. Cerwin-Vega states that its folded horn subwoofer cabinets, &quot;...on average, produce 6dB more output at 1 watt than a dual 18[-inch] vented box&quot; giving &quot;four times the output with half the number of drivers&quot;. The Cerwin-Vega JE-36C has a five feet long folded horn chamber length in the wooden cabinet.

Manifold subwoofers have two or more subwoofer speakers that feed the throat of a single horn. This increases SPL for the subwoofer, at the cost of increased distortion. EV has a manifold speaker cabinet in which four drivers are mounted as close together as practical. This is a different design than the &quot;multiple drivers in one throat&quot; approach. An unusual example of manifold subwoofer design is the Thomas Mundorf (TM) approach of having four subwoofers facing each other and sitting close together, which is used for theater in the round shows, where the audience surrounds the performers in a big circle (e.g. Metallica has used this in some concerts). The TM approach produces an omnidirectional bass sound. Cerwin-Vega defines a manifold enclosure as one in which &quot;...the driver faces into a tuned ported cavity. You hear sound directly from the back of the driver in addition to the sound that emanates out of the port. This type of enclosure design extends the frequency capability of the driver lower than it would reproduce by itself.&quot;

Bandpass subwoofers have a sealed cabinet within another cabinet, with the &quot;outer&quot; cabinet typically having a vent or port.

===Bass instrument amplification===
In rare cases, sound reinforcement subwoofer enclosures are also used for bass instrument amplification by electric bass players and synth bass players. For most bands and most small- to mid-size venues (e.g. nightclubs and bars), standard bass guitar speaker enclosures or keyboard amplifiers will provide sufficient sound pressure levels for onstage monitoring. Since a regular electric bass has a low &quot;E&quot; (41 Hz) as its lowest note, most standard bass guitar cabinets are only designed with a range that goes down to about 40 Hz. However, in some cases, performers wish to have extended sub-bass response that is not available from standard instrument speaker enclosures, so they use subwoofer cabinets. Just as some electric guitarists add huge stacks of guitar cabinets mainly for show, some bassists will add immense subwoofer cabinets with 18-inch woofers mainly for show, and the extension subwoofer cabinets will be operated at a lower volume than the main bass cabinets.

Bass guitar players who may use subwoofer cabinets include performers who play with extended range basses that include a low &quot;B&quot; string (about 31 Hz), bassists who play in styles where a very powerful sub-bass response is an important part of the sound (e.g. funk, Latin, gospel, R &amp; B, etc.), and/or bass players who perform in stadium-size venues or large outdoor venues. Keyboard players who use subwoofers for on-stage monitoring include electric organ players who use bass pedal keyboards (which go down to a low &quot;C&quot; which is about 33 Hz) and synth bass players who play rumbling sub-bass parts that go as low as 18 Hz. Of all of the keyboard instruments that are amplified onstage, synthesizers can produce some of the lowest pitches, because unlike a traditional electric piano or electric organ, which have as their lowest notes a low &quot;A&quot; and a low &quot;C&quot;, respectively, a synth does not have a fixed lowest octave. A synth player can add lower octaves to a patch by pressing an &quot;octave down&quot; button, which can produce pitches that are at the limits of human hearing.

Several concert sound subwoofer manufacturers suggest that their subs can be used for bass instrument amplification. Meyer Sound suggests that its 650-R2 Concert Series Subwoofer, a enclosure with two 18-inch drivers (45 cm), can be used for bass instrument amplification. While performers who use concert sound subwoofers for onstage monitoring may like the powerful sub-bass sound that they get onstage, sound engineers may find the use of large subwoofers (e.g. two 18-inch drivers (45 cm)) for onstage instrument monitoring to be problematic, because it may interfere with the &quot;Front of House&quot; sub-bass sound.

==Bass shakers==
Since infrasonic bass is felt, sub-bass can be augmented using tactile transducers. Unlike a typical subwoofer driver, which produces audible vibrations, tactile transducers produce low-frequency vibrations that are designed to be felt by individuals who are touching the transducer or indirectly through a piece of furniture or a wooden floor. Tactile transducers have recently emerged as a device class, called variously &quot;bass shakers&quot;, &quot;butt shakers&quot; and &quot;throne shakers&quot;. They are attached to a seat, for instance a drummer&#x27;s stool (&quot;throne&quot;) or gamer&#x27;s chair, car seat or home-cinema seating, and the vibrations of the driver are transmitted to the body then to the ear in a manner similar to bone conduction. They connect to an amplifier like a normal subwoofer. They can be attached to a large flat surface (for instance a floor or platform) to create a large low- frequency conduction area, although the transmission of low frequencies through the feet is not as efficient as through the seat.

The advantage of tactile transducers used for low frequencies is that they allow a listening environment that is not filled with loud low-frequency sound waves in the air. This helps the drummer in a rock music band to monitor their kick drum performance without filling the stage with powerful, loud low-frequency sound from a 15-inch (40 cm) subwoofer monitor and an amplifier, which can &quot;leak&quot; into other drum mics and lower the quality of the sound mix. By not having a large, powerful subwoofer monitor, a bass shaker also enables a drummer to lower the sound pressure levels that they are exposed to during a performance, reducing the risk of hearing damage. For home cinema or video game use, bass shakers help the user avoid disturbing others in nearby apartments or rooms, because even powerful sound effects such as explosion sounds in a war video game or the simulated rumbling of an earthquake in an adventure film will not be heard by others. However, some critics argue that the felt vibrations are disconnected from the auditory experience, and they claim that that music is less satisfying with the &quot;butt shaker&quot; than sound effects. As well, critics have claimed that the bass shaker itself can rattle during loud sound effects, which can distract the listener.

==World record claims==
With varying measures upon which to base claims, several subwoofers have been said to be the world&#x27;s largest, loudest or lowest.

===Matterhorn===
The Matterhorn is a subwoofer model completed in March 2007 by Danley Sound Labs in Gainesville, Georgia after a U.S. military request for a loudspeaker that could project infrasonic waves over a distance. The Matterhorn was designed to reproduce a continuous sine wave from 15 to 20 Hz, and generate 94 dB at a distance of , and more than 140 dB for music playback measured at the horn mouth. It can generate a constant 15 Hz sine wave tone at 140 dB for 24 hours a day, seven days a week with extremely low harmonic distortion. The subwoofer has a flat frequency response from 15 to 80 Hz, and is down 3 dB at 12 Hz. It was built within an intermodal container long and square. The container doors swing open to reveal a tapped horn driven by 40 long-throw 15-inch (40 cm) MTX speaker drivers each powered by its own 1000-watt amplifier. The manufacturer claims that 53 13-ply 18 mm sheets of plywood were used in its construction, though one of the fabricators wrote that double-thickness 26-ply sheets were used for convenience.

A diesel generator is housed within the enclosure to supply electricity when external power is unavailable. At the annual National Systems Contractors Association (NSCA) convention in March 2007, the Matterhorn was barred from making any loud demonstrations of its power because of concerns about damaging the building of the Orange County Convention Center. Instead, using only a single 20 amp electrical circuit for safety, visitors were allowed to step inside the horn of the subwoofer for an &quot;acoustic massage&quot; as the fractionally powered Matterhorn reproduced low level 10–15 Hz waves.

===Royal Device custom installation===
Another subwoofer claimed to be the world&#x27;s biggest is a custom installation in Italy made by Royal Device primarily of bricks, concrete and sound-deadening material consisting of two subwoofers embedded in the foundation of a listening room. The horn-loaded subwoofers each have a floor mouth that is , and a horn length that is , in a cavity under the floor of the listening room. Each subwoofer is driven by eight 18-inch subwoofer drivers with voice coils. The designers assert that the floor mouths of the horns are additionally loaded acoustically by a vertical wooden horn expansion and the room&#x27;s ceiling to create a 10 Hz &quot;full power&quot; wave at the listening position.

===Concept Design 60-inch===
A single diameter subwoofer driver was designed by Richard Clark and David Navone with the help of Eugene Patronis of the Georgia Institute of Technology. The driver was intended to break sound pressure level records when mounted in a road vehicle, calculated to be able to achieve more than 180 dBSPL. It was built in 1997, driven by DC motors connected to a rotary crankshaft somewhat like in a piston engine. The cone diameter was and was held in place with a surround. With a peak-to-peak stroke, it created a one-way air displacement of . It was capable of generating 5–20 Hz sine waves at various DC motor speeds—not as a response to audio signal—it could not play music. The driver was mounted in a stepvan owned by Tim Maynor but was too powerful for the amount of applied reinforcement and damaged the vehicle. MTX&#x27;s Loyd Ivey helped underwrite the project and the driver was then called the MTX &quot;Thunder 1000000&quot; (one million).

Still unfinished, the vehicle was entered in an SPL competition in 1997 at which a complaint was lodged against the computer control of the DC motor. Instead of using the controller, two leads were touched together in the hope that the motor speed was set correctly. The drive shaft broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162 dB. The Concept Design 60-inch was not shown in public after 1998.

===MTX Jackhammer===
The heaviest production subwoofer intended for use in automobiles is the MTX Jackhammer by MTX Audio, which features a diameter cone. The Jackhammer has been known to take upwards of 6000 watts sent to a dual voice coil moving within a strontium ferrite magnet. The Jackhammer weighs in at and has an aluminum heat sink. The Jackhammer has been featured on the reality TV show &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;.

<text>An eponym is a noun after which or for which someone or something is, or is believed to be, named. Adjectives derived from the word &quot;eponym&quot; include &quot;eponymous&quot; and &quot;eponymic&quot;. 

Eponyms are commonly used for time periods, places, innovations, biological nomenclature, astronomical objects, works of art and media, and tribal names. Various orthographic conventions are used for eponyms.

==Usage of the word==
The term &quot;eponym&quot; functions in multiple related ways, all based on an explicit relationship between two named things. &quot;Eponym&quot; may refer to a person or, less commonly, a place or thing for which someone or something is, or is believed to be, named. &quot;Eponym&quot; may also refer to someone or something named after, or believed to be named after, a person or, less commonly, a place or thing. A person, place, or thing named after a particular person share an eponymous relationship. In this way, Elizabeth I of England is the eponym of the Elizabethan era, but the Elizabethan era can also be referred to as the eponym of Elizabeth I of England. Eponyms may be named for things or places, for example 10 Downing Street, a building named after its street address. Adjectives and verbs may be eponyms, for example &quot;bowdlerize&quot;.

Adjectives derived from the word eponym include &quot;eponymous&quot; and &quot;eponymic&quot;. When Henry Ford is referred to as &quot;the &quot;eponymous&quot; founder of the Ford Motor Company&quot;, his surname &quot;Ford&quot; and the name of the motor company have an eponymous relationship. The word &quot;eponym&quot; can also refer to the title character of a fictional work (such as Rocky Balboa of the &quot;Rocky&quot; film series), as well as to self-titled works named after their creators (such as the album &quot;The Doors&quot; by the band the Doors). 

Walt Disney created the eponymous Walt Disney Company, with his name similarly extended to theme parks such as Walt Disney World. Medical eponymous terms are often called medical eponyms, although that usage is .

==History==
Periods have often been named after a ruler or other influential figure:
* One of the first recorded cases of eponymy occurred in the second millennium BC, when the Assyrians named each year after a high official (&quot;limmu&quot;).
* In ancient Greece, the eponymous archon was the highest magistrate in classical Athens. Eponymous archons served a term of one year which took the name of that particular archon (e.g., 594 BC was named after Solon). Later historians provided yet another case of eponymy by referring to the period of fifth-century Athens as The Age of Pericles after its most influential statesman Pericles.
* In Ptolemaic Egypt, the head priest of the Cult of Alexander and the Ptolemies was the eponymous priest after whom years were named.
* The Hebrew Bible explains the origins of peoples through individuals who bear their name. Jacob is renamed &quot;Israel&quot; (Gen 35:9) and his sons (or grandsons) name the original 12 tribes of Israel, while Edomites (Gen. 25:30), Moabites and Ammonites (Gen. 19:30-38), Canaanites (Gen. 9:20-27) and other tribes (the Kenites named after Cain (Cain&#x27;s life is detailed in Gen. 4:1-16)) are said to be named after other primal ancestors bearing their name. In most cases, the experiences and behavior of the ancestor is meant to indicate the characteristics of the people who take their name.
* In ancient Rome, one of the two formal ways of indicating a year was to cite the two annual consuls who served in that year. For example, the year we know as 59 BC would have been described as &quot;the consulship of Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus and Gaius Julius Caesar&quot; (although that specific year was known jocularly as &quot;the consulship of Julius and Caesar&quot; because of the insignificance of Caesar&#x27;s counterpart). Under the empire, the consuls would change as often as every two months, but only the two consuls at the beginning of the year would lend their names to that year.
* During the Christian era, itself eponymous, many royal households used eponymous dating by regnal years. The Roman Catholic Church, however, eventually used the &quot;Anno Domini&quot; dating scheme - based on the birth of Christ - on both the general public and royalty. The regnal year standard is still used with respect to statutes and law reports published in some parts of the United Kingdom and in some Commonwealth countries (England abandoned this practice in 1963).
* Government administrations may become referred to eponymously, such as &quot;Kennedy&#x27;s Camelot&quot; and &quot;the Nixon Era&quot;.
* British monarchs have become eponymous throughout the English-speaking world for time periods, fashions, etc. &quot;Elizabethan&quot;, &quot;Georgian&quot;, &quot;Victorian&quot;, and &quot;Edwardian&quot; are examples of these.

Trends
* Political trends or movements are often named after a government leader. Examples include &quot;Jacksonian democracy&quot;, &quot;Stalinism&quot;, &quot;Maoism&quot;, &quot;Obamacare&quot;, and &quot;Thatcherism&quot;.

==Other eponyms==
* In intellectual property law, an eponym can refer to a generic trademark or brand name, a form of metonymy, such as aspirin, heroin and thermos in the United States.
* In geography, places and towns can also be given an eponymous name through a relationship to an important figure. Peloponnesus, for instance, was said to derive its name from the Greek hero Pelops. In historical times, new towns have often been named (and older communities renamed) after their founders, discoverers, or notable individuals. Examples include Vancouver, British Columbia, named after explorer George Vancouver; and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, originally called Isbister&#x27;s Settlement but renamed after Queen Victoria&#x27;s husband and consort in 1866.
* In science and technology:
** Discoveries and innovations are often named after the discoverer or a figure influential in their advance. Examples are the Avogadro constant, the Diesel engine, meitnerium, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and the Apgar score. For a different view of the process see Stigler&#x27;s law of eponymy.
** In biological nomenclature, organisms often receive scientific names that honor a person. Examples are the plant &quot;Linnaea&quot; (after Carl Linnaeus), the baobab &quot;Adansonia&quot; (after Michel Adanson), and the moth &quot;Caligula&quot; (after the Roman emperor Caligula). Common names can also be named after a person. Later, people may decide that they do not wish to memorialize a particular person, resulting in efforts to change a long-standing name. As debating each individual name is time-consuming, the American Ornithological Society announced in 2024 that they would establish new common names for all birds in North America that had previously been named after a person, without regard to whether modern culture would judge the person well or poorly.
** Relatedly, biomedical terminology uses many eponymous terms, and many also have noneponymous synonyms. 
** Many astronomical objects are named after their discoverer or another person.
* In art:
** Plays, books, and other forms of entertainment may have eponymous names, such as the ancient Greek epic &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, derived from its principal character, Odysseus, and the novel &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.
** The term is also used in the music industry, usually with regard to record titles, where it is prevalent and leads to confusion. For example, Bad Company&#x27;s first album was entitled &quot;Bad Company&quot; and contained a popular song named &quot;Bad Company&quot;. Parodying this, the band R.E.M. titled a 1988 compilation album &quot;Eponymous&quot;. One especially convoluted case of eponyms is the 1969 song &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, named after the 1963 movie &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;; the band that wrote the song changed their name to Black Sabbath and released it on the album &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;.
* In tribal antiquity, both in ancient Greece and independently among the Hebrews, tribes often took the name of a legendary leader (as Achaeus for Achaeans, or Dorus for Dorians). The eponym gave apparent meaning to the mysterious names of tribes, and sometimes, as in the Sons of Noah, provided a primitive attempt at ethnology as well, in the genealogical relationships of eponymous originators.

==Orthographic conventions==

===Capitalized versus lowercase===
* Because proper nouns are capitalized in English, the usual default for eponyms is to capitalize the eponymous part of a term. When used as proper adjectives they are normally capitalized, for example Victorian, Shakespearean, and Kafkaesque.
* However, some eponymous adjectives and noun adjuncts are nowadays entered in many dictionaries as lowercase when they have evolved a common status, no longer deriving their meaning from the proper-noun origin. For example, &quot;Herculean&quot; when referring to Hercules himself, but often &quot;herculean&quot; when referring to the figurative, generalized extension sense; and &quot;quixotic&quot; and &quot;diesel engine&quot; [lowercase only]. For any given term, one dictionary may enter only lowercase or only cap, whereas other dictionaries may recognize the capitalized version as a variant, either equally common as, or less common than, the first-listed styling (marked with labels such as &quot;or&quot;, &quot;also&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, or &quot;sometimes&quot;). &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, in its section &quot;Words derived from proper names&quot;, gives some examples of both lowercase and capitalized stylings, including a few terms styled both ways, and says, &quot;Authors and editors must decide for themselves, but whatever choice is made should be followed consistently throughout a work.&quot;
* When the eponym is used together with a noun, the common-noun part is not capitalized (unless it is part of a title or it is the first word in a sentence). For example, in &quot;Parkinson disease&quot; (named after James Parkinson), &quot;Parkinson&quot; is capitalized, but &quot;disease&quot; is not. In addition, the adjectival form, where one exists, is usually lowercased for medical terms (thus &quot;parkinsonian&quot; although &quot;Parkinson disease&quot;), and gram-negative, gram-positive although Gram stain. Uppercase Gram-positive or Gram-negative however are also commonly used in scientific journal articles and publications. In other fields, the eponym derivative is commonly capitalized, for example, &quot;Newtonian&quot; in physics, and &quot;Platonic&quot; in philosophy (however, use lowercase &quot;platonic&quot; when describing love). The capitalization is retained after a prefix and hyphen, e.g. &quot;non-Newtonian&quot;.

For examples, see the comparison table below.

===Genitive versus attributive===
* English can use either genitive case or attributive position to indicate the adjectival nature of the eponymous part of the term. (In other words, that part may be either possessive or non-possessive.) Thus &quot;Parkinson&#x27;s disease&quot; and &quot;Parkinson disease&quot; are both acceptable. Medical dictionaries have been shifting toward nonpossessive styling in recent decades. Thus &quot;Parkinson disease&quot; is more likely to be used in the latest medical literature (especially in postprints) than &quot;Parkinson&#x27;s disease&quot;.

===National varieties of English===
* American and British English spelling differences may apply to eponyms. For example, British style would typically be &quot;caesarean section&quot;, which is also found in American medical publications, but &quot;cæsarean section&quot; (with a ligature) is sometimes seen in (mostly older) British writing, and &quot;cesarean&quot; is preferred by American dictionaries and some American medical works.

<doc id="45812" wikidata="Q311697" url="?curid=45812" title="Pim Fortuyn">
<text>Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, known as Pim Fortuyn (; 19 February 1948 – 6 May 2002), was a Dutch politician, author, civil servant, businessman, sociologist and academic who founded the party Pim Fortuyn List (Lijst Pim Fortuyn or LPF) in 2002.

Fortuyn worked as a professor at the Erasmus University of Rotterdam before branching into a business career and was an advisor to the Dutch government on social infrastructure. He then became prominent in the Netherlands as a press columnist, writer and media commentator.

Initially a Marxist who was sympathetic to the Communist Party of the Netherlands, and later a member of the Dutch Labour Party in the 1970s, Fortuyn&#x27;s beliefs began to shift to the right in the 1990s, especially related to the immigration policies of the Netherlands. Fortuyn criticised multiculturalism, immigration and Islam in the Netherlands. He called Islam &quot;a backward culture&quot;, and was quoted as saying that if it were legally possible, he would close the borders for Muslim immigrants. Fortuyn also supported tougher measures against crime and opposed state bureaucracy, wanting to reduce the Dutch financial contribution to the European Union. He was labelled a far-right populist by his opponents and in the media, but he fiercely rejected this label. Fortuyn was openly gay and a supporter of gay rights.

Fortuyn explicitly distanced himself from &quot;far-right&quot; politicians such as the Belgian Filip Dewinter, Austrian Jörg Haider, or Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Pen whenever compared to them. While he compared his own politics to centre-right politicians such as Silvio Berlusconi of Italy and Edmund Stoiber of Germany, he also admired former Dutch Prime Minister Joop den Uyl, a social democrat, and Democratic U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Fortuyn also criticised the polder model and the policies of the outgoing government of Wim Kok and repeatedly described himself and LPF&#x27;s ideology as pragmatic and not populistic. In March 2002, his newly created LPF became the largest party in Fortuyn&#x27;s hometown Rotterdam during the Dutch municipal elections held that year.

Fortuyn was assassinated during the 2002 Dutch national election campaign by Volkert van der Graaf, a left-wing environmentalist and animal rights activist. In court at his trial, van der Graaf said he murdered Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as &quot;scapegoats&quot; and targeting &quot;the weak members of society&quot; in seeking political power. The LPF went on to poll in second place during the election but went into decline soon after.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn was born on 19 February 1948 in Driehuis within the Dutch municipality of Velsen, as the third child to a middle class Catholic family. His father worked as a salesman and his mother was a housewife. He attended Mendelcollege secondary school in Haarlem where he was described as an academically gifted pupil. As a youth, Fortuyn initially wanted to train as a priest, but in 1967 he began to study sociology at the University of Amsterdam and transferred after a few months to the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. In 1971 he ended his study with the Academic degree Doctorandus. In 1981 he received a doctorate in sociology at the University of Groningen as a Doctor of Philosophy.

=== Career ===

==== Professional career ====

Fortuyn worked as a lecturer at the Nyenrode Business Universiteit and as an associate professor at the University of Groningen, where he taught Marxist sociology. He was also an employee of the Groningen University Newspaper for which he wrote columns. He was a Marxist at the time and sympathized with the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN), although he never became a full member. Later, he joined the Labour Party.

In 1989 Fortuyn became director of a government organisation administering student transport cards and worked as an advisor to the Social and Economic Council (SER). In 1990 he moved to Rotterdam. From 1991 to 1995, he was an extraordinary professor at the Erasmus University Rotterdam, appointed to the Albeda-chair in &quot;employment conditions in public service&quot; and ran an education consultancy business.

When his contract ended, he made a career of public speaking, writing books and press columns, and worked as a weekly columnist for &quot;Elsevier.&quot; He gradually involved himself in politics through regularly appearing on televised debate shows and became a familiar public figure for his charismatic and flamboyant speaking style. In 1994 he began hosting his own radio program on &quot;RTV Rijnmond&quot; and often appeared on the political debate show &quot;Buitenhof&quot; and later as a commentator on the business current affairs program &quot;Business Class&quot; on RTL Nederland. Fortuyn was openly gay, and said in a 2002 interview that he was Catholic.

==== Political career ====

Fortuyn began his political career on the left and was initially a Marxist due to an aversion to the Dutch political establishment which he described as dominated by pillarization and a &quot;regent mentality.&quot; He was sympathetic to the Dutch Communist Party but chose not to become a member due to personal disagreements with the party leadership and self-identified as a Marxist without becoming active in any communist organisations. In the 1970s he joined the Labour Party and became a social democrat. In 1986, his views shifted towards neoliberalism in the hope that the free market would lead to further individual emancipation, ending a perceived oppression by state bureaucracy. In 1991, he proposed firing half of all civil servants and promoted privatisation and decentralisation. In 1992, Fortuyn wrote &quot;Aan het volk van Nederland&quot; (&quot;To the people of the Netherlands&quot;), in which he declared himself to be the spiritual successor of the charismatic but controversial 18th-century Dutch patriot politician Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol. The book urges the already culturally emancipated citizen to use the free market to also liberate himself economically, from the welfare state. In 1989, Fortuyn left the Labour Party and during the 1990s became a member of the centre-right VVD and was briefly a political consultant to the Christian Democratic Appeal in the early 2000s.

Though on economic matters Fortuyn would largely remain a neoliberal, culturally he soon became strongly influenced by the neoconservative political philosopher and chief editor of the weekly &quot;Elsevier&quot; Hendrik Jan Schoo who made him a columnist in 1993. Schoo deplored that a progressive new class would have promoted multiculturalism, founding an anti-racist civil religion on article 1 of the Dutch constitution, forbidding discrimination. Whereas in the early 1990s Fortuyn had held liberal views on immigration, this changed under the influence of Schoo.

Dutch neocons understood that in the evermore secularising Netherlands a change on the lines of the Reagan Revolution had become highly improbable. Women&#x27;s rights, gay rights, abortion and euthanasia had been generally accepted. In his 1995 book &quot;De verweesde samenleving&quot; (&quot;The orphaned society&quot;), Fortuyn claimed that the progressive movement of the 1960s had eroded traditional norms and values. Both the roles of the &quot;symbolic father&quot; and the &quot;caring mother&quot; had been lost, leaving an orphaned population without guidance, to live out a meaningless decadent existence. However, Fortuyn did not propose a return to old socially conservative or Dutch Calvinist and iconoclastic values and argued that the media, schools and artists should provide a moral leadership, explicitly promoting and defending the new values of modern Western society, constantly recreating the Dutch identity. Fortuyn consistently retained a liberal stance on matters such as LGBT rights throughout his political career.

Adopting the philosophical analysis by Carl Schmitt, it was assumed that such an identity could only be defined in antithesis to some actually existing concrete enemy. Inspired by Samuel Huntington&#x27;s &quot;The Clash of Civilizations&quot;, Dutch ethnicity was to be re-invented by identifying that enemy as Islam. In his 1997 book &quot;Tegen de islamisering van onze cultuur&quot; (&quot;Against the islamisation of our culture&quot;), Fortuyn proposed that after the fall of communism a new adversary would be found in Muslim culture. Fortuyn explained the global fundamentalist wave of the 1990s as a backlash against the insecurities caused by globalisation. The Dutch should counter Islamic fundamentalism by promoting and defending their own &quot;fundament&quot;, Dutch culture, especially modernism and the Enlightenment values. These should not yet be imposed on the Dutch population as a whole, with the exception of immigrants. Whereas American neoconservatives promoted hard power policies in relation to the Muslim world, Dutch neocons favoured a soft power approach. Shortly before the September 11 attacks, Fortuyn called for a Cold War against Islam, meaning a non-military defensive enmity. The attacks and the War on Terror made Islam a main issue in Dutch politics for the first time.

Fortuyn announced his intention to run for parliament in a television interview with &quot;EenVandaag&quot; in 2001, although he did not specify which party he would seek to stand as a candidate with. Although he was already in contact with the newly formed Livable Netherlands (LN) party, he also considered running for the Christian Democratic Appeal which he had worked as a consultant for, or even creating his own list. Livable Netherlands founder Jan Nagel subsequently invited him to run as party leader and Fortuyn was elected &quot;lijsttrekker&quot; (lead candidate) by a large majority of party members at the LN conference on 26 November 2001, prior to the Dutch general election of 2002. In his leadership bid and general election campaign, Fortuyn attacked the mainstream parties on multiculturalism, immigration and law &amp; order. He also called for less government interference and for a reform of the Dutch public health and education systems. He concluded his acceptance speech by saying the words in English that would become his slogan; &quot;At your service!&quot; Support for LN rose dramatically during Fortuyn&#x27;s brief leadership, climbing from 2% in opinion polls to about 17%.

On 9 February 2002, Fortuyn gave an interview to &quot;Volkskrant&quot;, a Dutch newspaper (see below) regarding his beliefs on immigration and Islam. His statements were considered so controversial that LN dismissed him as &quot;lijsttrekker&quot; the next day. Against the advice of his campaign team, Fortuyn said in the interview that he favoured closing borders to Muslim immigrants and if possible he would abolish the &quot;peculiar article&quot; of the Dutch constitution forbidding discrimination (at the time it was generally assumed that he referred to Article 1, the equality before the law; it has been argued, however, that Fortuyn and the interviewer had confused this with Article 137 of the Penal Code, incitement to hatred).

===== Founding the LPF =====
Having been rejected by Livable Netherlands, Fortuyn founded his own party Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) on 11 February 2002, taking many former LN members and supporters with him. Heading the list of the Livable Rotterdam party, considered to be the local counterpart of the LPF, he achieved a major victory in the Rotterdam municipal council elections in early March 2002. The new party won about 36% of the seats, making it the largest party in the council. For the first time since the Second World War, the Labour Party was out of power in Rotterdam.

Fortuyn&#x27;s victory made him the subject of hundreds of interviews during the next three months, and he made many statements about his political ideology. In March he released his book &quot;The Mess of Eight Purple Years&quot; (&quot;De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars&quot;), which criticised the current political system in the Netherlands and was used as his political agenda for the upcoming general election. Purple is the colour to indicate a coalition government consisting of left parties (red) and conservative-liberal parties (blue). The Netherlands had been governed by such a coalition for eight years at that time.

On 14 March 2002, Fortuyn was pied by a left-wing activist from the Biotic Baking Brigade in The Hague. As a result, Fortuyn began to express a fear of being injured or assassinated and accused members of the Dutch political establishment of encouraging violence against him.

== Death ==
On 6 May 2002, at age 54, Fortuyn was assassinated by gunshot in Hilversum, North Holland, by Volkert van der Graaf. The attack took place in a car park outside a radio studio where Fortuyn had just given an interview. This was nine days before the general election, in which he was running. The attacker was pursued by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn&#x27;s driver, and was arrested by the police shortly afterward, still in possession of a handgun. Months later, Van der Graaf confessed in court to the first notable political assassination in the Netherlands since 1672 (excluding World War II). On 15 April 2003, he was convicted of assassinating Fortuyn and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving two-thirds of his sentence, the standard procedure under the Dutch penal system.

The assassination shocked many residents of the Netherlands and highlighted the cultural clashes within the country. Various conspiracy theories arose after Pim Fortuyn&#x27;s murder and deeply affected Dutch politics and society. Politicians from all parties suspended campaigning. After consultation with LPF, the government decided not to postpone the elections. As Dutch law did not permit modifying the ballots, Fortuyn became a posthumous candidate. The LPF made an unprecedented debut in the House of Representatives by winning 26 seats (17% of the 150 seats in the house). The LPF joined a cabinet with the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, but conflicts in the rudderless LPF quickly collapsed the cabinet, forcing new elections. By the following year, the party had lost support, winning only eight seats in the 2003 elections. It won no seats in the 2006 elections, by which time the Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, had emerged as a successor.

During the last months of his life, Fortuyn had become closer to the Catholic Church. To the surprise of many commentators and Dutch TV hosts, Fortuyn insisted on Fr. Louis Berger, a parish priest from The Hague, accompanying him in some of his last TV appearances. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Berger had become his &quot;friend and confessor&quot; during the last weeks of his life.

=== Burial ===
Fortuyn was initially buried in Driehuis in the Netherlands. He was re-interred on 20 July 2002, at San Giorgio della Richinvelda, in the province of Pordenone in Italy, where he had owned a house.

When asked about his opposition to Muslim immigration, Fortuyn explained that, &quot;I have no desire to go through the emancipation of women and homosexuals all over again.&quot; In August 2001, Fortuyn was quoted in the &quot;Rotterdams Dagblad&quot; newspaper saying, &quot;I am also in favour of a cold war with Islam. I see Islam as an extraordinary threat, as a hostile religion.&quot; In the TV program &quot;Business class&quot;, Fortuyn said that Muslims in the Netherlands did not accept Dutch society; he believed that the religion of Islam was fundamentally intolerant and incompatible with Western values. He said that Muslims in the Netherlands needed to accept living &quot;together&quot; with the Dutch, and that if this was unacceptable for them, then they were free to leave. His concluding words in the TV program were &quot;... I want to live together with the Muslim people, but .&quot; Fortuyn also maintained that he did not object to Muslim immigrants because of their race or ethnicity, and was not against a multi-racial society, but opposed what he saw as lack of integration and unwillingness to adapt to Dutch standards of modernity and social liberalism within Muslim communities. 


On 9 February 2002, additional statements made by him were carried in the &quot;Volkskrant&quot;. He said that the Netherlands, with a population of 16 million, had enough inhabitants, and the practice of allowing as many as 40,000 asylum-seekers into the country each year had to be stopped. The actual number for 2001 was 27,000, down slightly on the previous year. He claimed that if he became part of the next government, he would pursue a restrictive immigration policy while also granting citizenship to a large group of illegal immigrants.

He said that he did not intend to &quot;unload our Moroccan hooligans&quot; onto the Moroccan King Hassan. Hassan had died three years earlier. He considered Article 7 of the constitution, which asserts freedom of speech, of more importance than Article 1, which forbids discrimination on the basis of religion, life principles, political inclination, race, or sexual preference. Fortuyn distanced himself from Hans Janmaat of the Centrum Democraten, who in the 1980s wanted to remove all foreigners from the country and was repeatedly convicted for discrimination and hate speech.

Fortuyn proposed that all people who already resided in the Netherlands would be allowed to stay, provided the immigrants adopted the Dutch society&#x27;s consensus on human rights as their own. He stated: &quot;not integrating means leaving&quot; and &quot;the borders have to be hermetically closed&quot;. He said &quot;If it were legally possible, I&#x27;d say no more Muslims will get in here&quot;, claiming that the influx of Muslims would threaten freedoms in the liberal Dutch society. He thought Muslim culture had never undergone a process of modernisation and therefore still lacked acceptance of democracy and women&#x27;s, gays&#x27;, lesbians&#x27; and minorities&#x27; rights.

When asked by the Dutch newspaper &quot;Volkskrant&quot; whether he hated Islam, he replied:

I don&#x27;t hate Islam. I consider it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it&#x27;s just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It&#x27;s a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can&#x27;t humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that&#x27;s possible. That&#x27;s something that one can be proud of. And I&#x27;d like to keep it that way, thank you very much.

Fortuyn used the word &quot;achterlijk&quot;, literally meaning &quot;backward&quot;, but commonly used as an insult in the sense of &quot;retarded&quot;. After his use of &quot;achterlijk&quot; caused an uproar, Fortuyn said he had used the word with its literal meaning of &quot;backward&quot;.

Fortuyn wrote &quot;Against the Islamization of Our Culture&quot; (1997) (in Dutch).

===Fortuynism===

The ideology or political style that is derived from Pim Fortuyn, and in turn the LPF, is often called Fortuynism. Observers variously saw him as a political protest targeting the alleged elitism and bureaucratic style of the Dutch purple coalitions or as offering an appealing political style. The style was characterized variously as one &quot;of openness, directness and clearness&quot;, populism or simply as charisma. Another school holds Fortuynism as a distinct ideology, with an alternative vision of society. Some argued that Fortuynism was not just &quot;one&quot; ideology, but contained liberalism, populism and nationalism.

During the 2002 campaign, Fortuyn was accused by some of being on the &quot;extreme right&quot;, although others saw only certain similarities. While he employed anti-immigration rhetoric, he considered himself neither a radical nationalist nor a defender of traditional authoritarian values. On the contrary, Fortuyn claimed he wanted to protect the socio-culturally liberal values of the Netherlands, women&#x27;s rights and sexual minorities (he was openly gay himself), from the &quot;backward&quot; Islamic culture. He held liberal views favouring the drug policy of the Netherlands, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and related positions. Fortuyn was also a member of the Republican Society, and favoured a US-style system with an elected president, elected mayors and police commissioners. He also expressed support for the state of Israel throughout his political career.

The LPF also won support from some ethnic minorities; one of Fortuyn&#x27;s closest associates was of Cape Verdean origin, and one of the party&#x27;s MPs was a young woman of Turkish descent.

His ideology comprised the following positions:

* Civil liberties
* Classical liberalism
* Criticism of Islam
* Deregulation
* Direct democracy
* Euroscepticism
* Freedom of speech
* Laissez-faire
* LGBT rights
* Republicanism
* Secularism
* Separation of church and state
* Small government
* Women&#x27;s rights
==Criticism==

Fortuyn was compared with the politicians Jörg Haider and Jean-Marie Le Pen in the foreign press. These comparisons were often referred to by Dutch reporters and politicians. An explicit comparison with Le Pen was made by Ad Melkert, then &quot;lijsttrekker&quot; of the Labour Party, who said in Emmen on 24 April 2002: &quot;If you flirt with Fortuyn, then in the Netherlands the same thing will happen as happened in France. There they woke up with Le Pen, soon we will wake up with Fortuyn.&quot;

On 5 May, the day before the assassination, Fortuyn in a debate with Melkert organized by the &quot;Algemeen Dagblad&quot; newspaper claimed that he was demonized. In it he said that he often had to tell journalists that the image created of him in the media was incorrect.

Columnist Jan Blokker wrote that &quot;[a]fter reading [...] I realized once again that Professor Pim may really be called the Jean-Marie Le Pen, the Filip Dewinter, the Jörg Haider and the new Hans Janmaat of the Netherlands.&quot; Prime Minister Wim Kok accused Fortuyn of stirring up fear and stimulating xenophobia among the Dutch people. In the run-up to the 2002 election, GroenLinks leader Paul Rosenmöller claimed Fortuyn&#x27;s policies were &quot;not just right but extreme right&quot;.

Fortuyn often responded to criticism by stating that his views were misunderstood or distorted by the media, and in turn rejected comparisons and expressed his personal distaste for radical far-right politicians in other European countries. He explicitly distanced himself from Jean-Marie Le Pen and criticised some of his policies, including Le Pen&#x27;s downplaying of the Holocaust. In domestic politics, Fortuyn also distanced his views from hard-right Dutch politicians such as Hans Janmaat and Joop Glimmerveen (who called for the mass expulsion of foreigners from the Netherlands) by maintaining that if he came to power, he would pardon existing illegal immigrants if they had lived in the Netherlands for over five years and offer them a path to citizenship if they could be assimilated into society.

In an interview on the Dutch talk show &quot;Jensen!&quot; that was broadcast shortly before his death, Fortuyn accused members of the Dutch government and political establishment of putting his life in danger through repeatedly demonizing him and his beliefs.

==Legacy==

Fortuyn changed the Dutch political landscape. The 2002 elections, only weeks after Fortuyn&#x27;s death, were marked by large losses for the liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and especially the social democratic Labour Party (whose parliamentary group was halved in size); both parties replaced their leaders shortly after their losses. The election winners were the Pim Fortuyn List, and the Christian democratic Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) whose leader Jan Peter Balkenende went on to become prime minister. Some commentators in the mainstream political class speculated that Fortuyn&#x27;s perceived martyrdom created greater support for the LPF, hence that party&#x27;s brief surge to 17% of the electoral vote and 26 of the 150 seats in the Dutch Parliament. Others opined that voters who would have otherwise supported the LPF had Fortuyn not been murdered voted for the CDA as Balkenende had not joined in with other party leaders in attacking Fortuyn. Balkenende later claimed to have shared some of Fortuyn&#x27;s opinions and pledged to implement some of his policy ideas. Although the LPF was able to form a coalition with the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, it was bereft with internal strife and quickly lost steam. The coalition cabinet of Jan Peter Balkenende fell within three months, due to infighting within the LPF. In the following elections, the LPF was left with only eight seats in parliament (out of 150) and was not included in the new government. Many of the LPF&#x27;s successive leaders were not regarded as charismatic as Fortuyn and as the next cabinet under Balkenende continued many of the former coalition&#x27;s policies, it became harder for the LPF to present an alternative image to the government. However, political commentators speculated that discontented voters might vote for a non-traditional party, if a viable alternative was at hand. Later, the right-wing Party for Freedom, which has a strong stance on immigration, proposing to deport criminal, unemployed or not assimilated non-western immigrants, won nine (out of 150) seats in the 2006 elections and became the largest party in the 2023 elections, reaching 37 seats.

The Netherlands has made its asylum policy more strict. Opponents of Fortuynism, such as Paul Rosenmöller, Thom de Graaf, and Ad Melkert (all labelling Fortuyn as a right-wing extremist), have objected to what they think is a harsher political and social climate, especially towards immigrants and Muslims.

However, other commentators such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali, David Starkey and Douglas Murray have retrospectively defended some of Fortuyn&#x27;s beliefs. Former Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende also stated that he later agreed with some of Fortuyn&#x27;s criticisms of multiculturalism and the purple coalition under Wim Kok.

Contemporary Dutch politics is more polarized than it has been in recent years, especially on the issues for which Fortuyn was best known. People debate the success of their multicultural society, and whether they need to better assimilate newcomers. The government&#x27;s decision in 2004 to more strictly expel asylum seekers whose applications had failed was controversial. Fortuyn had advocated for a one-time amnesty for those asylum seekers who had resided in the Netherlands for an extended period.

In 2004, in a TV show, Fortuyn was chosen as De Grootste Nederlander (&quot;Greatest Dutchman of all-time&quot;), followed closely by William of Orange, the leader of the independence war that established the precursor to the present-day Netherlands. The election was not considered representative, as it was held by viewers&#x27; voting through the internet and by phoning in. Theo van Gogh had been murdered a few days before by a Muslim, which likely affected people&#x27;s voting in the TV contest for Fortuyn. The program later revealed that William of Orange had received the most votes, but many could not be counted until after the official closing time of the television show (and the proclamation of the winner), due to technical problems. The official rules of the show said that votes counted before the end of the show would be decisive, but it was suggested that all votes correctly cast before the closing of the vote would be counted. Following the official rules, the outcome was not changed.


Right-wing politicians gained greater public influence after Fortuyn&#x27;s death, such as former Minister for Integration &amp; Immigration Rita Verdonk, the prominent critic of Islam, Member of the House of Representatives Geert Wilders who in 2006 formed the Party for Freedom (which became the largest party in the House of Representatives in 2023) and Thierry Baudet, leader of the Forum for Democracy party. These politicians often focus on the debate over cultural assimilation and integration.

Supporters of Fortuyn went on to set up the annual &quot;Pim Fortuyn Prize&quot; which is awarded to opinion makers, politicians or commentators who best convey the ideas of Pim Fortuyn. Winners have included Ebru Umar and John van den Heuvel.

<text>Structural engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering in which structural engineers are trained to design the &#x27;bones and joints&#x27; that create the form and shape of human-made structures. Structural engineers also must understand and calculate the stability, strength, rigidity and earthquake-susceptibility of built structures for buildings and nonbuilding structures. The structural designs are integrated with those of other designers such as architects and building services engineer and often supervise the construction of projects by contractors on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, and vehicles where structural integrity affects functioning and safety. See glossary of structural engineering.

Structural engineering theory is based upon applied physical laws and empirical knowledge of the structural performance of different materials and geometries. Structural engineering design uses a number of relatively simple structural concepts to build complex structural systems. Structural engineers are responsible for making creative and efficient use of funds, structural elements and materials to achieve these goals.
==History==

Structural engineering dates back to 2700 B.C. when the step pyramid for Pharaoh Djoser was built by Imhotep, the first engineer in history known by name. Pyramids were the most common major structures built by ancient civilizations because the structural form of a pyramid is inherently stable and can be almost infinitely scaled (as opposed to most other structural forms, which cannot be linearly increased in size in proportion to increased loads).

The structural stability of the pyramid, whilst primarily gained from its shape, relies also on the strength of the stone from which it is constructed, and its ability to support the weight of the stone above it. The limestone blocks were often taken from a quarry near the building site and have a compressive strength from 30 to 250 MPa (MPa = Pa × 106). Therefore, the structural strength of the pyramid stems from the material properties of the stones from which it was built rather than the pyramid&#x27;s geometry.

Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction were carried out by artisans, such as stonemasons and carpenters, rising to the role of master builder. No theory of structures existed, and understanding of how structures stood up was extremely limited, and based almost entirely on empirical evidence of &#x27;what had worked before&#x27; and intuition. Knowledge was retained by guilds and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.

No record exists of the first calculations of the strength of structural members or the behavior of structural material, but the profession of a structural engineer only really took shape with the Industrial Revolution and the re-invention of concrete (see History of Concrete). The physical sciences underlying structural engineering began to be understood in the Renaissance and have since developed into computer-based applications pioneered in the 1970s.

===Timeline===

* 1452–1519 Leonardo da Vinci made many contributions.
* 1638: Galileo Galilei published the book &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; in which he examined the failure of simple structures.
* 1660: Hooke&#x27;s law by Robert Hooke.
* 1687: Isaac Newton published &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, which contains his laws of motion.
* 1750: Euler–Bernoulli beam equation.
* 1700–1782: Daniel Bernoulli introduced the principle of virtual work.
* 1707–1783: Leonhard Euler developed the theory of buckling of columns.
* 1826: Claude-Louis Navier published a treatise on the elastic behaviors of structures.
* 1873: Carlo Alberto Castigliano presented his dissertation &quot;Intorno ai sistemi elastici&quot;, which contains his theorem for computing displacement as the partial derivative of the strain energy. This theorem includes the method of &quot;least work&quot; as a special case.
* 1874: Otto Mohr formalized the idea of a statically indeterminate structure.
* 1922: Timoshenko corrects the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation.
* 1936: Hardy Cross&#x27; publication of the moment distribution method, an important innovation in the design of continuous frames.
* 1941: Alexander Hrennikoff solved the discretization of plane elasticity problems using a lattice framework.
* 1942: Richard Courant divided a domain into finite subregions.
* 1956: J. Turner, R. W. Clough, H. C. Martin, and L. J. Topp&#x27;s paper on the &quot;Stiffness and Deflection of Complex Structures&quot; introduces the name &quot;finite-element method&quot; and is widely recognized as the first comprehensive treatment of the method as it is known today.

===Structural failure===
The history of structural engineering contains many collapses and failures. Sometimes this is due to obvious negligence, as in the case of the Pétion-Ville school collapse, in which Rev. Fortin Augustin &quot; constructed the building all by himself, saying he didn&#x27;t need an engineer as he had good knowledge of construction&quot; following a partial collapse of the three-story schoolhouse that sent neighbors fleeing. The final collapse killed 94 people, mostly children.

In other cases structural failures require careful study, and the results of these inquiries have resulted in improved practices and a greater understanding of the science of structural engineering. Some such studies are the result of forensic engineering investigations where the original engineer seems to have done everything in accordance with the state of the profession and acceptable practice yet a failure still eventuated. A famous case of structural knowledge and practice being advanced in this manner can be found in a series of failures involving box girders which collapsed in Australia during the 1970s.

==Theory==

Structural engineering depends upon a detailed knowledge of applied mechanics, materials science, and applied mathematics to understand and predict how structures support and resist self-weight and imposed loads. To apply the knowledge successfully a structural engineer generally requires detailed knowledge of relevant empirical and theoretical design codes, the techniques of structural analysis, as well as some knowledge of the corrosion resistance of the materials and structures, especially when those structures are exposed to the external environment. Since the 1990s, specialist software has become available to aid in the design of structures, with the functionality to assist in the drawing, analyzing and designing of structures with maximum precision; examples include AutoCAD, StaadPro, ETABS, Prokon, Revit Structure, Inducta RCB, etc. Such software may also take into consideration environmental loads, such as earthquakes and winds.

==Profession==
Structural engineers are responsible for engineering design and structural analysis. Entry-level structural engineers may design the individual structural elements of a structure, such as the beams and columns of a building. More experienced engineers may be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building.

Structural engineers often specialize in particular types of structures, such as buildings, bridges, pipelines, industrial, tunnels, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft. Structural engineers who specialize in buildings may specialize in particular construction materials such as concrete, steel, wood, masonry, alloys and composites.

Structural engineering has existed since humans first started to construct their structures. It became a more defined and formalized profession with the emergence of architecture as a distinct profession from engineering during the industrial revolution in the late 19th century. Until then, the architect and the structural engineer were usually one and the same thing – the master builder. Only with the development of specialized knowledge of structural theories that emerged during the 19th and early 20th centuries, did the professional structural engineers come into existence.

The role of a structural engineer today involves a significant understanding of both static and dynamic loading and the structures that are available to resist them. The complexity of modern structures often requires a great deal of creativity from the engineer in order to ensure the structures support and resist the loads they are subjected to. A structural engineer will typically have a four or five-year undergraduate degree, followed by a minimum of three years of professional practice before being considered fully qualified.
Structural engineers are licensed or accredited by different learned societies and regulatory bodies around the world (for example, the Institution of Structural Engineers in the UK). Depending on the degree course they have studied and/or the jurisdiction they are seeking licensure in, they may be accredited (or licensed) as just structural engineers, or as civil engineers, or as both civil and structural engineers.
Another international organisation is IABSE(International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering). The aim of that association is to exchange knowledge and to advance the practice of structural engineering worldwide in the service of the profession and society.

==Specializations==

===Building structures===



Structural building engineering is primarily driven by the creative manipulation of materials and forms and the underlying mathematical and scientific ideas to achieve an end that fulfills its functional requirements and is structurally safe when subjected to all the loads it could reasonably be expected to experience. This is subtly different from architectural design, which is driven by the creative manipulation of materials and forms, mass, space, volume, texture, and light to achieve an end which is aesthetic, functional, and often artistic.

The structural design for a building must ensure that the building can stand up safely, able to function without excessive deflections or movements which may cause fatigue of structural elements, cracking or failure of fixtures, fittings or partitions, or discomfort for occupants. It must account for movements and forces due to temperature, creep, cracking, and imposed loads. It must also ensure that the design is practically buildable within acceptable manufacturing tolerances of the materials. It must allow the architecture to work, and the building services to fit within the building and function (air conditioning, ventilation, smoke extract, electrics, lighting, etc.). The structural design of a modern building can be extremely complex and often requires a large team to complete.

Structural engineering specialties for buildings include:
* Earthquake engineering
* Façade engineering
* Fire engineering
* Roof engineering
* Tower engineering
* Wind engineering

===Earthquake engineering structures===
Earthquake engineering structures are those engineered to withstand earthquakes.

The main objectives of earthquake engineering are to understand the interaction of structures with the shaking ground, foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes, and design and construct the structures to perform during an earthquake.

Earthquake-proof structures are not necessarily extremely strong like the El Castillo pyramid at Chichen Itza shown above.

One important tool of earthquake engineering is base isolation, which allows the base of a structure to move freely with the ground.

===Civil engineering structures===
Civil structural engineering includes all structural engineering related to the built environment. It includes:

The structural engineer is the lead designer on these structures, and often the sole designer. In the design of structures such as these, structural safety is of paramount importance (in the UK, designs for dams, nuclear power stations and bridges must be signed off by a chartered engineer).

Civil engineering structures are often subjected to very extreme forces, such as large variations in temperature, dynamic loads such as waves or traffic, or high pressures from water or compressed gases. They are also often constructed in corrosive environments, such as at sea, in industrial facilities, or below ground.

 resisted and significant deflections of structures.

The forces which parts of a machine are subjected to can vary significantly and can do so at a great rate. The forces which a boat or aircraft are subjected to vary enormously and will do so thousands of times over the structure&#x27;s lifetime. The structural design must ensure that such structures can endure such loading for their entire design life without failing.

These works can require mechanical structural engineering:
* Boilers and pressure vessels
* Coachworks and carriages
* Cranes
* Elevators
* Escalators
* Marine vessels and hulls

===Aerospace structures===

Aerospace structure types include launch vehicles, (Atlas, Delta, Titan), missiles (ALCM, Harpoon), Hypersonic vehicles (Space Shuttle), military aircraft (F-16, F-18) and commercial aircraft (Boeing 777, MD-11). Aerospace structures typically consist of thin plates with stiffeners for the external surfaces, bulkheads, and frames to support the shape and fasteners such as welds, rivets, screws, and bolts to hold the components together.

===Nanoscale structures===
A nanostructure is an object of intermediate size between molecular and microscopic (micrometer-sized) structures. In describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the nanoscale. Nanotextured surfaces have one dimension on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100 nm. Nanotubes have two dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100 nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, spherical nanoparticles have three dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100 nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and ultrafine particles (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometer range. The term &#x27;nanostructure&#x27; is often used when referring to magnetic technology.

===Structural engineering for medical science===
Medical equipment (also known as armamentarium) is designed to aid in the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of medical conditions. There are several basic types: diagnostic equipment includes medical imaging machines, used to aid in diagnosis; equipment includes infusion pumps, medical lasers, and LASIK surgical machines; medical monitors allow medical staff to measure a patient&#x27;s medical state. Monitors may measure patient vital signs and other parameters including ECG, EEG, blood pressure, and dissolved gases in the blood; diagnostic medical equipment may also be used in the home for certain purposes, e.g. for the control of diabetes mellitus. A biomedical equipment technician (BMET) is a vital component of the healthcare delivery system. Employed primarily by hospitals, BMETs are the people responsible for maintaining a facility&#x27;s medical equipment.

==Structural elements==


Any structure is essentially made up of only a small number of different types of elements:
* Columns
* Beams
* Plates
* Arches
* Shells
* Catenaries

Many of these elements can be classified according to form (straight, plane / curve) and dimensionality (one-dimensional / two-dimensional):

===Columns===
Columns are elements that carry only axial force (compression) or both axial force and bending (which is technically called a beam-column but practically, just a column). The design of a column must check the axial capacity of the element and the buckling capacity.

The buckling capacity is the capacity of the element to withstand the propensity to buckle. Its capacity depends upon its geometry, material, and the effective length of the column, which depends upon the restraint conditions at the top and bottom of the column. The effective length is formula_1 where formula_2 is the real length of the column and K is the factor dependent on the restraint conditions.

The capacity of a column to carry axial load depends on the degree of bending it is subjected to, and vice versa. This is represented on an interaction chart and is a complex non-linear relationship.

===Beams===

A beam may be defined as an element in which one dimension is much greater than the other two and the applied loads are usually normal to the main axis of the element. Beams and columns are called line elements and are often represented by simple lines in structural modeling.
* cantilevered (supported at one end only with a fixed connection)
* simply supported (fixed against vertical translation at each end and horizontal translation at one end only, and able to rotate at the supports)
* fixed (supported in all directions for translation and rotation at each end)
* continuous (supported by three or more supports)
* a combination of the above (ex. supported at one end and in the middle)

Beams are elements that carry pure bending only. Bending causes one part of the section of a beam (divided along its length) to go into compression and the other part into tension. The compression part must be designed to resist buckling and crushing, while the tension part must be able to adequately resist the tension.

===Trusses===


A truss is a structure comprising members and connection points or nodes. When members are connected at nodes and forces are applied at nodes members can act in tension or compression. Members acting in compression are referred to as compression members or struts while members acting in tension are referred to as tension members or ties. Most trusses use gusset plates to connect intersecting elements. Gusset plates are relatively flexible and unable to transfer bending moments. The connection is usually arranged so that the lines of force in the members are coincident at the joint thus allowing the truss members to act in pure tension or compression.

Trusses are usually used in large-span structures, where it would be uneconomical to use solid beams.

===Plates===
Plates carry bending in two directions. A concrete flat slab is an example of a plate. Plate behavior is based on continuum mechanics. Due to the complexity involved they are most often analyzed using a finite element analysis. 

They can also be designed with yield line theory, where an assumed collapse mechanism is analyzed to give an upper bound on the collapse load. This technique is used in practice but because the method provides an upper-bound (i.e. an unsafe prediction of the collapse load) for poorly conceived collapse mechanisms, great care is needed to ensure that the assumed collapse mechanism is realistic.

===Shells===

Shells derive their strength from their form and carry forces in compression in two directions. A dome is an example of a shell. They can be designed by making a hanging-chain model, which will act as a catenary in pure tension and inverting the form to achieve pure compression.

===Arches===
Arches carry forces in compression in one direction only, which is why it is appropriate to build arches out of masonry. They are designed by ensuring that the line of thrust of the force remains within the depth of the arch. It is mainly used to increase the bountifulness of any structure.

===Catenaries===
Catenaries derive their strength from their form and carry transverse forces in pure tension by deflecting (just as a tightrope will sag when someone walks on it). They are almost always cable or fabric structures. A fabric structure acts as a catenary in two directions.
==Materials==
Structural engineering depends on the knowledge of materials and their properties, in order to understand how different materials support and resist loads. It also involves a knowledge of Corrosion engineering to avoid for example galvanic coupling of dissimilar materials.

Common structural materials are:
* Iron: wrought iron, cast iron
* Concrete: reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete
* Alloy: steel, stainless steel
* Masonry
* Timber: hardwood, softwood
* Aluminium
* Composite materials: plywood
* Other structural materials: adobe, bamboo, carbon fibre, fiber reinforced plastic, mudbrick, roofing materials

<text>Tetanus (), also known as lockjaw, is a bacterial infection caused by &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot; and characterized by muscle spasms. In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body. Each spasm usually lasts for a few minutes. Spasms occur frequently for three to four weeks. Some spasms may be severe enough to fracture bones. Other symptoms of tetanus may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate. The onset of symptoms is typically 3 to 21 days following infection. Recovery may take months; about 10% of cases prove to be fatal.

&quot;C. tetani&quot; is commonly found in soil, saliva, dust, and manure. The bacteria generally enter through a break in the skin, such as a cut or puncture wound caused by a contaminated object. They produce toxins that interfere with normal muscle contractions. Diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms. The disease does not spread between people.

Tetanus can be prevented by immunization with the tetanus vaccine. In those who have a significant wound and have had fewer than three doses of the vaccine, both vaccination and tetanus immune globulin are recommended. The wound should be cleaned, and any dead tissue should be removed. In those who are infected, tetanus immune globulin, or, if unavailable, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used. Muscle relaxants may be used to control spasms. Mechanical ventilation may be required if a person&#x27;s breathing is affected.

Tetanus occurs in all parts of the world but is most frequent in hot and wet climates where the soil has a high organic content. In 2015, there were about 209,000 infections and about 59,000 deaths globally. This is down from 356,000 deaths in 1990. In the US, there are about 30 cases per year, almost all of which were in people who had not been vaccinated. An early description of the disease was made by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC. The cause of the disease was determined in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone at the University of Turin, and a vaccine was developed in 1924.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Tetanus often begins with mild spasms in the jaw muscles—also known as lockjaw. Similar spasms can also be a feature of trismus. The spasms can also affect the facial muscles, resulting in an appearance called &quot;risus sardonicus&quot;. Chest, neck, back, abdominal muscles, and buttocks may be affected. Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called opisthotonus. Sometimes, the spasms affect muscles utilized during inhalation and exhalation, which can lead to breathing problems.

Prolonged muscular action causes sudden, powerful, and painful contractions of muscle groups, called tetany. These episodes can cause fractures and muscle tears. Other symptoms include fever, headache, restlessness, irritability, feeding difficulties, breathing problems, burning sensation during urination, urinary retention, and loss of stool control.

Even with treatment, about 10% of people who contract tetanus die. The mortality rate is higher in unvaccinated individuals, and in people over 60 years of age.

=== Incubation period ===
The incubation period of tetanus may be up to several months but is usually about ten days. In general, the farther the injury site is from the central nervous system, the longer the incubation period. However, shorter incubation periods will have more severe symptoms. In &quot;trismus nascentium&quot; (i.e. neonatal tetanus), symptoms usually appear from 4 to 14 days after birth, averaging about 7 days. On the basis of clinical findings, four different forms of tetanus have been described.

=== Generalized tetanus ===
Generalized tetanus is the most common type of tetanus, representing about 80% of cases. The generalized form usually presents with a descending pattern. The first sign is trismus or lockjaw, then facial spasms (called &quot;risus sardonicus),&quot; followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, and rigidity of pectoral and calf muscles. Other symptoms include elevated temperature, sweating, elevated blood pressure, and episodic rapid heart rate. Spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes, with the body shaped into a characteristic form called opisthotonos. Spasms continue for up to four weeks, and complete recovery may take months.

=== Neonatal tetanus ===

Neonatal tetanus (&quot;trismus nascentium&quot;) is a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns, usually those born to mothers who themselves have not been vaccinated. If the mother has been vaccinated against tetanus, the infants acquire passive immunity, and are thus protected. It usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the stump is cut with a non-sterile instrument. As of 1998, neonatal tetanus was common in many developing countries, and was responsible for about 14% (215,000) of all neonatal deaths. In 2010, the worldwide death toll was approximately 58,000 newborns. As the result of a public health campaign, the death toll from neonatal tetanus was reduced by 90% between 1990 and 2010, and by 2013, the disease had been largely eliminated from all but 25 countries. Neonatal tetanus is rare in developed countries.

=== Local tetanus ===
Local tetanus is an uncommon form of the disease, in which people have persistent contraction of muscles in the same anatomic area as the injury. The contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding. Local tetanus is generally milder; only about 1% of cases are fatal, but it may precede the onset of generalized tetanus.

=== Cephalic tetanus ===
Cephalic tetanus is the rarest form of the disease (0.9–3% of cases), and is limited to muscles and nerves in the head. It usually occurs after trauma to the head area, including: skull fracture, laceration, eye injury, dental extraction, and otitis media, but it has been observed from injuries to other parts of the body. Paralysis of the facial nerve is most frequently implicated, which may cause lockjaw, facial palsy, or ptosis, but other cranial nerves can also be affected. Cephalic tetanus may progress to a more generalized form of the disease. Due to its rarity, clinicians may be unfamiliar with the clinical presentation, and may not suspect tetanus as the illness. Treatment can be complicated, as symptoms may be concurrent with the initial injury that caused the infection. Cephalic tetanus is more likely than other forms of tetanus to be fatal, with the progression to generalized tetanus carrying a 15–30% case fatality rate.

== Cause ==
Tetanus is caused by the tetanus bacterium, &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot;. The disease is an international health problem, as &quot;C. tetani&quot; endospores are ubiquitous. Endospores can be introduced into the body through a puncture wound (penetrating trauma). Due to &quot;C. tetani&quot; being an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack oxygen, such as a puncture wound. With the changes in oxygen levels, the turkey drumstick-shaped endospore can quickly spread.

The disease occurs almost exclusively in people who are inadequately immunized. It is more common in hot, damp climates with soil rich in organic matter. Manure-treated soils may contain spores, as they are widely distributed in the intestines and feces of many animals, such as horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens. In agricultural areas, a significant number of human adults may harbor the organism.

The spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated heroin. Rarely, tetanus can be contracted through surgical procedures, intramuscular injections, compound fractures, and dental infections. Animal bites can transmit tetanus.

Tetanus is often associated with rust, especially rusty nails. Although rust itself does not cause tetanus, objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or in places that harbor soil bacteria. Additionally, the rough surface of rusty metal provides crevices for dirt containing &quot;C. tetani&quot;, while a nail affords a means to puncture the skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound. An endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment may exist under the skin, and the puncturing object can deliver endospores to a suitable environment for growth. It is a common misconception that rust itself is the cause; a related misconception is that a puncture from a rust-free nail is not a risk.

== Pathophysiology ==

Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) binds to the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, is internalized, and is transported back through the axon until it reaches the central nervous system. Here, it selectively binds to and is transported into inhibitory neurons via endocytosis. It then leaves the vesicle for the neuron cytosol, where it cleaves vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) synaptobrevin, which is necessary for membrane fusion of small synaptic vesicles (SSV&#x27;s). SSV&#x27;s carry neurotransmitter to the membrane for release, so inhibition of this process blocks neurotransmitter release.

Tetanus toxin specifically blocks the release of the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine from inhibitory neurons. These neurotransmitters keep overactive motor neurons from firing and also play a role in the relaxation of muscles after contraction. When inhibitory neurons are unable to release their neurotransmitters, motor neurons fire out of control, and muscles have difficulty relaxing. This causes the muscle spasms and spastic paralysis seen in tetanus infection.

The tetanus toxin, tetanospasmin, is made up of a heavy chain and a light chain. There are three domains, each of which contributes to the pathophysiology of the toxin. The heavy chain has two of the domains. The N-terminal side of the heavy chain helps with membrane translocation, and the C-terminal side helps the toxin locate the specific receptor site on the correct neuron. The light chain domain cleaves the VAMP protein once it arrives in the inhibitory neuron cytosol.

There are four main steps in tetanus&#x27;s mechanism of action: binding to the neuron, internalization of the toxin, membrane translocation, and cleavage of the target VAMP.

=== Neurospecific binding ===

The toxin travels from the wound site to the neuromuscular junction through the bloodstream, where it binds to the presynaptic membrane of a motor neuron. The heavy chain C-terminal domain aids in binding to the correct site, recognizing and binding to the correct glycoproteins and glycolipids in the presynaptic membrane. The toxin binds to a site that will be taken into the neuron as an endocytic vesicle that will travel down the axon, past the cell body, and down the dendrites to the dendritic terminal at the spine and central nervous system. Here, it will be released into the synaptic cleft, and allowed to bind with the presynaptic membrane of inhibitory neurons in a similar manner seen with the binding to the motor neuron.

=== Internalization ===

Tetanus toxin is then internalized again via endocytosis, this time, in an acidic vesicle. In a mechanism not well understood, depolarization caused by the firing of the inhibitory neuron causes the toxin to be pulled into the neuron inside vesicles.

=== Membrane translocation ===

The toxin then needs a way to get out of the vesicle and into the neuron cytosol for it to act on its target. The low pH of the vesicle lumen causes a conformational change in the toxin, shifting it from a water-soluble form to a hydrophobic form. With the hydrophobic patches exposed, the toxin can slide into the vesicle membrane. The toxin forms an ion channel in the membrane that is nonspecific for Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl− ions. There is a consensus among experts that this new channel is involved in the translocation of the toxin&#x27;s light chain from the inside of the vesicle to the neuron cytosol, but the mechanism is not well understood or agreed upon. It has been proposed that the channel could allow the light chain (unfolded from the low pH environment) to leave through the toxin pore, or that the pore could alter the electrochemical gradient enough, by letting in or out ions, to cause osmotic lysis of the vesicle, spilling the vesicle&#x27;s contents.

=== Enzymatic target cleavage ===

The light chain of the tetanus toxin is zinc-dependent protease. It shares a common zinc protease motif (His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His) that researchers hypothesized was essential for target cleavage until this was more recently confirmed by experiment: when all zinc was removed from the neuron with heavy metal chelators, the toxin was inhibited, only to be reactivated when the zinc was added back in. The light chain binds to VAMP, and cleaves it between Gln76 and Phe77. Without VAMP, vesicles holding the neurotransmitters needed for motor neuron regulation (GABA and glycine) cannot be released, causing the above-mentioned deregulation of motor neurons and muscle tension.

==Diagnosis==
There are currently no blood tests for diagnosing tetanus. The diagnosis is based on the presentation of tetanus symptoms and does not depend upon isolation of the bacterium, which is recovered from the wound in only 30% of cases and can be isolated from people without tetanus. Laboratory identification of &quot;C. tetani&quot; can be demonstrated only by the production of tetanospasmin in mice. Having recently experienced head trauma may indicate cephalic tetanus--a rare form of tetanus resulting in weakened facial muscles and spasms--if no other diagnosis has been made.

The &quot;spatula test&quot; is a clinical test for tetanus that involves touching the posterior pharyngeal wall with a soft-tipped instrument and observing the effect. A positive test result is the involuntary contraction of the jaw (biting down on the &quot;spatula&quot;), and a negative test result would normally be a gag reflex attempting to expel the foreign object. A short report in &quot;The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene&quot; states that, in an affected subject research study, the spatula test had a high specificity (zero false-positive test results) and a high sensitivity (94% of infected people produced a positive test).

== Prevention ==
Unlike many infectious diseases, recovery from naturally acquired tetanus does not usually result in immunity. This is due to the extreme potency of the tetanospasmin toxin. Tetanospasmin will likely be lethal before it will provoke an immune response.

Tetanus can be prevented by vaccination with tetanus toxoid. The CDC recommends that adults receive a booster vaccine every ten years, and standard care practice in many places is to give the booster to any person with a puncture wound who is uncertain of when they were last vaccinated, or if they have had fewer than three lifetime doses of the vaccine. The booster may not prevent a potentially fatal case of tetanus from the current wound, however, as it can take up to two weeks for tetanus antibodies to form.

In children under the age of seven, the tetanus vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, DPT/DTaP vaccine, which also includes vaccines against diphtheria and pertussis. For adults and children over seven, the Td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) is commonly used.

The World Health Organization certifies countries as having eliminated maternal or neonatal tetanus. Certification requires at least two years of rates of less than 1 case per 1,000 live births. In 1998 in Uganda, 3,433 tetanus cases were recorded in newborn babies; of these, 2,403 died. After a major public health effort, Uganda was certified as having eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus in 2011.

===Post-exposure prophylaxis===
Tetanus toxoid can be given in case of suspected exposure to tetanus. In such cases, it can be given with or without tetanus immunoglobulin (also called &quot;tetanus antibodies&quot; or &quot;tetanus antitoxin&quot;). It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.

The guidelines for such events in the United States for people at least 11 years old (and not pregnant) are as follows:

==Treatment==
=== Mild tetanus ===
Mild cases of tetanus can be treated with:
* Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG), also called &quot;tetanus antibodies&quot; or &quot;tetanus antitoxin.&quot; It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.
* Antibiotic therapy to reduce toxin production. Metronidazole intravenous (IV) is a preferred treatment.
* Benzodiazepines can be used to control muscle spasms. Options include diazepam and lorazepam, oral or IV.

=== Severe tetanus ===
Severe cases will require admission to intensive care. In addition to the measures listed above for mild tetanus:
* Human tetanus immunoglobulin injected intrathecally (which increases clinical improvement from 4% to 35%).
* Tracheotomy and mechanical ventilation for 3 to 4 weeks. Tracheotomy is recommended for securing the airway, because the presence of an endotracheal tube is a stimulus for spasm.
* Magnesium sulfate, as an intravenous infusion, to control spasm and autonomic dysfunction.
* Diazepam as a continuous IV infusion.
* The autonomic effects of tetanus can be difficult to manage (alternating hyper- and hypotension hyperpyrexia/hypothermia), and may require IV labetalol, magnesium, clonidine, or nifedipine.

Drugs, such as diazepam or other muscle relaxants, can be given to control the muscle spasms. In extreme cases, it may be necessary to paralyze the person with curare-like drugs, and use a mechanical ventilator.

To survive a tetanus infection, the maintenance of an airway and proper nutrition are required. An intake of and at least 150 g of protein per day is often given in liquid form through a tube directly into the stomach (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), or through a drip into a vein (parenteral nutrition). This high-caloric diet maintenance is required because of the increased metabolic strain brought on by the increased muscle activity. Full recovery takes 4 to 6 weeks because the body must regenerate destroyed nerve axon terminals.

The antibiotic of choice is metronidazole. It can be given intravenously, by mouth, or by rectum. Of likewise efficiency is penicillin, but some raise the concern of provoking spasms because it inhibits GABA receptor, which is already affected by tetanospasmin.

== Epidemiology ==

In 2013, it caused about 59,000 deaths—down from 356,000 in 1990. Tetanus, notably the neonatal form, remains a significant public health problem in non-industrialized countries, with 59,000 newborns dying worldwide in 2008 as a result of neonatal tetanus. In the United States, from 2000 through 2007, an average of 31 cases were reported per year. Nearly all of the cases in the United States occur in unimmunized individuals, or individuals who have allowed their inoculations to lapse.
== In animals ==

Tetanus is found primarily in goats and sheep. The following are clinical symptoms found in affected goats and sheep. Extended head and neck, tail rigors 
(tail becomes rigid and straight), abnormal gait (walking becomes stiff and abnormal), arched back, stiffness of the jaw muscles, lockjaw,
twitching of eyes, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, difficulty or inability to eat and drink, abdominal bloat, spasms (uncontrolled muscular contractions) before death. 
Death sometimes is due to asphyxiation, secondary to respiratory paralysis.

==History==
Tetanus was well known to ancient civilizations, who recognized the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms. In 1884, Arthur Nicolaier isolated the strychnine-like toxin of tetanus from free-living, anaerobic soil bacteria. The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone, two pathologists of the University of Turin, who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time. They produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting pus from a person with fatal tetanus into their sciatic nerves, and testing their reactions while tetanus was spreading.

In 1891, &quot;C. tetani&quot; was isolated from a human victim by Kitasato Shibasaburō, who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies. In 1897, Edmond Nocard showed that tetanus antitoxin induced passive immunity in humans, and could be used for prophylaxis and treatment. Tetanus toxoid vaccine was developed by P. Descombey in 1924, and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during World War II.

===Etymology===
The word tetanus comes from the , which is further from the .

== Research ==
There is insufficient evidence that tetanus can be treated or prevented by vitamin C. This is at least partially due to the fact that the historical trials that were conducted in attempts to look for a possible connection between vitamin C and alleviating tetanus patients were of poor quality.

<text>A gyrocompass is a type of non-magnetic compass which is based on a fast-spinning disc and the rotation of the Earth (or another planetary body if used elsewhere in the universe) to find geographical direction automatically. A gyrocompass makes use of one of the seven fundamental ways to determine the heading of a vehicle. A gyroscope is an essential component of a gyrocompass, but they are different devices; a gyrocompass is built to use the effect of gyroscopic precession, which is a distinctive aspect of the general gyroscopic effect. Gyrocompasses, such as the fibre optic gyrocompass are widely used to provide a heading for navigation on ships. This is because they have two significant advantages over magnetic compasses:
* they find true north as determined by the axis of the Earth&#x27;s rotation, which is different from, and navigationally more useful than, &quot;magnetic&quot; north, and
* they have a greater degree of accuracy because they are unaffected by ferromagnetic materials, such as in a ship&#x27;s steel hull, which distort the magnetic field.

Aircraft commonly use gyroscopic instruments (but not a gyrocompass) for navigation and attitude monitoring; for details, see flight instruments (specifically the heading indicator) and gyroscopic autopilot.

== History ==
The first, not yet practical, form of gyrocompass was patented in 1885 by Marinus Gerardus van den Bos. A usable gyrocompass was invented in 1906 in Germany by Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe, and after successful tests in 1908 became widely used in the German Imperial Navy. Anschütz-Kaempfe founded the company Anschütz &amp; Co. in Kiel, to mass produce gyrocompasses; the company is today Raytheon Anschütz GmbH. The gyrocompass was an important invention for nautical navigation because it allowed accurate determination of a vessel’s location at all times regardless of the vessel’s motion, the weather and the amount of steel used in the construction of the ship.

In the United States, Elmer Ambrose Sperry produced a workable gyrocompass system (1908: ), and founded the Sperry Gyroscope Company. The unit was adopted by the U.S. Navy (1911), and played a major role in World War I. The Navy also began using Sperry&#x27;s &quot;Metal Mike&quot;: the first gyroscope-guided autopilot steering system. In the following decades, these and other Sperry devices were adopted by steamships such as the , airplanes, and the warships of World War II. After his death in 1930, the Navy named the after him.

Meanwhile, in 1913, C. Plath (a Hamburg, Germany-based manufacturer of navigational equipment including sextants and magnetic compasses) developed the first gyrocompass to be installed on a commercial vessel. C. Plath sold many gyrocompasses to the Weems’ School for Navigation in Annapolis, MD, and soon the founders of each organization formed an alliance and became Weems &amp; Plath.
Before the success of the gyrocompass, several attempts had been made in Europe to use a gyroscope instead. By 1880, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) tried to propose a gyrostat to the British Navy. In 1889, Arthur Krebs adapted an electric motor to the Dumoulin-Froment marine gyroscope, for the French Navy. That gave the &quot;Gymnote&quot; submarine the ability to keep a straight line while underwater for several hours, and it allowed her to force a naval block in 1890.

In 1923 Max Schuler published his paper containing his observation that if a gyrocompass possessed Schuler tuning such that it had an oscillation period of 84.4 minutes (which is the orbital period of a notional satellite orbiting around the Earth at sea level), then it could be rendered insensitive to lateral motion and maintain directional stability.

== Operation ==
A gyroscope, not to be confused with a gyrocompass, is a spinning wheel mounted on a set of gimbals so that its axis is free to orient itself in any way. When it is spun up to speed with its axis pointing in some direction, due to the law of conservation of angular momentum, such a wheel will normally maintain its original orientation to a fixed point in outer space (not to a fixed point on Earth). Since the Earth rotates, it appears to a stationary observer on Earth that a gyroscope&#x27;s axis is completing a full rotation once every 24 hours. Such a rotating gyroscope is used for navigation in some cases, for example on aircraft, where it is known as heading indicator or directional gyro, but cannot ordinarily be used for long-term marine navigation. The crucial additional ingredient needed to turn a gyroscope into a gyrocompass, so it would automatically position to true north, is some mechanism that results in an application of torque whenever the compass&#x27;s axis is not pointing north.

One method uses friction to apply the needed torque: the gyroscope in a gyrocompass is not completely free to reorient itself; if for instance a device connected to the axis is immersed in a viscous fluid, then that fluid will resist reorientation of the axis. This friction force caused by the fluid results in a torque acting on the axis, causing the axis to turn in a direction orthogonal to the torque (that is, to precess) along a line of longitude. Once the axis points toward the celestial pole, it will appear to be stationary and won&#x27;t experience any more frictional forces. This is because true north (or true south) is the only direction for which the gyroscope can remain on the surface of the earth and not be required to change. This axis orientation is considered to be a point of minimum potential energy.

Another, more practical, method is to use weights to force the axis of the compass to remain horizontal (perpendicular to the direction of the center of the Earth), but otherwise allow it to rotate freely within the horizontal plane. In this case, gravity will apply a torque forcing the compass&#x27;s axis toward true north. Because the weights will confine the compass&#x27;s axis to be horizontal with respect to the Earth&#x27;s surface, the axis can never align with the Earth&#x27;s axis (except on the Equator) and must realign itself as the Earth rotates. But with respect to the Earth&#x27;s surface, the compass will appear to be stationary and pointing along the Earth&#x27;s surface toward the true North Pole.

Since the gyrocompass&#x27;s north-seeking function depends on the rotation around the axis of the Earth that causes torque-induced gyroscopic precession, it will not orient itself correctly to true north if it is moved very fast in an east to west direction, thus negating the Earth&#x27;s rotation. However, aircraft commonly use heading indicators or directional gyros, which are not gyrocompasses and do not align themselves to north via precession, but are periodically aligned manually to magnetic north.

== Errors ==
A gyrocompass is subject to certain errors. These include steaming error, where rapid changes in course, speed and latitude cause deviation before the gyro can adjust itself. On most modern ships the GPS or other navigational aids feed data to the gyrocompass allowing a small computer to apply a correction.
Alternatively a design based on a strapdown architecture (including a triad of fibre optic gyroscopes, ring laser gyroscopes or hemispherical resonator gyroscopes and a triad of accelerometers) will eliminate these errors, as they do not depend upon mechanical parts to determinate rate of rotation.

== Mathematical model ==
We consider a gyrocompass as a gyroscope which is free to rotate about one of its symmetry axes, also the whole rotating gyroscope is free to rotate on the horizontal plane about the local vertical. Therefore there are two independent local rotations. In addition to these rotations we consider the rotation of the Earth about its north-south (NS) axis, and we model the planet as a perfect sphere. We neglect friction and also the rotation of the Earth about the Sun.

In this case a non-rotating observer located at the center of the Earth can be approximated as being an inertial frame. We establish cartesian coordinates formula_1 for such an observer (whom we name as 1-O), and the barycenter of the gyroscope is located at a distance formula_2 from the center of the Earth.

=== First time-dependent rotation ===
Consider another (non-inertial) observer (the 2-O) located at the center of the Earth but rotating about the NS-axis by formula_3 We establish coordinates attached to this observer as
formula_4
so that the unit formula_5 versor formula_6 is mapped to the point formula_7. For the 2-O neither the Earth nor the barycenter of the gyroscope is moving. The rotation of 2-O relative to 1-O is performed with angular velocity formula_8. We suppose that the formula_9 axis denotes points with zero longitude (the prime, or Greenwich, meridian).

=== Second and third fixed rotations ===
We now rotate about the formula_10 axis, so that the formula_11-axis has the longitude of the barycenter. In this case we have
formula_12

With the next rotation (about the axis formula_13 of an angle formula_14, the co-latitude) we bring the formula_15 axis along the local zenith (formula_16-axis) of the barycenter. This can be achieved by the following orthogonal matrix (with unit determinant)
formula_17

so that the formula_18 versor formula_19 is mapped to the point formula_20

=== Constant translation ===
We now choose another coordinate basis whose origin is located at the barycenter of the gyroscope. This can be performed by the following translation along the zenith axis
formula_21

so that the origin of the new system, formula_22 is located at the point formula_23 and formula_2 is the radius of the Earth. Now the formula_25-axis points towards the south direction.

=== Fourth time-dependent rotation ===
Now we rotate about the zenith formula_26-axis so that the new coordinate system is attached to the structure of the gyroscope, so that for an observer at rest in this coordinate system, the gyrocompass is only rotating about its own axis of symmetry. In this case we find
formula_27

The axis of symmetry of the gyrocompass is now along the formula_28-axis.

=== Last time-dependent rotation ===
The last rotation is a rotation on the axis of symmetry of the gyroscope as in
formula_29

== Dynamics of the system ==
Since the height of the gyroscope&#x27;s barycenter does not change (and the origin of the coordinate system is located at this same point), its gravitational potential energy is constant. Therefore its Lagrangian formula_30 corresponds to its kinetic energy formula_31 only. We have
formula_32
where formula_33 is the mass of the gyroscope, and
formula_34
is the squared inertial speed of the origin of the coordinates of the final coordinate system (i.e. the center of mass). This constant term does not affect the dynamics of the gyroscope and it can be neglected. On the other hand, the tensor of inertia is given by
formula_35
and
formula_36

Therefore we find
formula_37

The Lagrangian can be rewritten as
formula_38
where
formula_39
is the part of the Lagrangian responsible for the dynamics of the system. Then, since formula_40, we find
formula_41

Since the angular momentum formula_42 of the gyrocompass is given by formula_43 we see that the constant formula_44 is the component of the angular momentum about the axis of symmetry. Furthermore, we find the equation of motion for the variable formula_45 as
formula_46
or
formula_47

=== Particular case: the poles ===
At the poles we find formula_48 and the equations of motion become
formula_49

This simple solution implies that the gyroscope is uniformly rotating with constant angular velocity in both the vertical and symmetrical axis.

=== The general and physically relevant case ===
Let us suppose now that formula_50 and that formula_51, that is the axis of the gyroscope is approximately along the north-south line, and let us find the parameter space (if it exists) for which the system admits stable small oscillations about this same line. If this situation occurs, the gyroscope will always be approximately aligned along the north-south line, giving direction. In this case we find
formula_52

Consider the case that
formula_53
and, further, we allow for fast gyro-rotations, that is
formula_54

Therefore, for fast spinning rotations, formula_55 implies formula_56 In this case, the equations of motion further simplify to
formula_57

Therefore we find small oscillations about the north-south line, as formula_58, where the angular velocity of this harmonic motion of the axis of symmetry of the gyrocompass about the north-south line is given by
formula_59
which corresponds to a period for the oscillations given by
formula_60

Therefore formula_61 is proportional to the geometric mean of the Earth and spinning angular velocities. In order to have small oscillations we have required formula_62, so that the North is located along the right-hand-rule direction of the spinning axis, that is along the negative direction of the formula_63-axis, the axis of symmetry. As a side result, on measuring formula_64 (and knowing formula_65), one can deduce the local co-latitude formula_66

<doc id="45833" wikidata="Q1093499" url="?curid=45833" title="Palatino">
<text>Palatino is an old-style serif typeface designed by Hermann Zapf, initially released in 1949 by the Stempel foundry and later by other companies, most notably the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. Palatino is optimised for legitibility with open counters, balanced proportions, moderate stroke contrast and flared serifs.

== Background ==
Named after the 16th-century Italian master of calligraphy Giambattista Palatino, Palatino is based on the humanist types of the Italian Renaissance, which mirror the letters formed by a broad nib pen reflecting Zapf&#x27;s expertise as a calligrapher. Its capital &#x27;Y&#x27; is in the unusual &#x27;palm Y&#x27; style, inspired by the Greek letter upsilon, a trait found in some of the earliest versions of the letter such as that of Aldus Manutius. 

Unlike most Renaissance typeface revivals, which tend to have delicate proportions such as a low x-height (short lower-case letters and longer ascenders and descenders), Palatino has larger proportions, increasing legibility. Palatino was particularly intended as a design for trade or &#x27;jobbing&#x27; use, such as headings, advertisements and display printing, and was created with a solid, wide structure and wide apertures that could appear clearly on poor-quality paper, when read at a distance or printed at small sizes. 

Palatino is one of several related typefaces by Zapf, which Stempel marketed as an &quot;extended family&quot;. The group includes Palatino, Sistina, Michelangelo, and Aldus; Zapf&#x27;s biographer Jerry Kelly describes them as forming &quot;the largest type family based on classic renaissance forms at the time.&quot; These designs were strongly influenced by Italian Renaissance letter forms and Roman square capitals, although Zapf was unable to visit Italy until after he had finished the Palatino roman. Palatino rapidly became popular for book body text use, overshadowing the narrower and lighter Aldus, which Zapf had designed for this role. It has been described as one of the ten most used serif typefaces. Since Palatino was not originally designed for body text, some of its characters were intended to stand out with quirky, calligraphic design features, and Zapf later redesigned them with more sober alternates, which have become the norm on most digital versions.

Linotype licensed Palatino to Adobe and Apple who incorporated it into the PostScript digital printing technology as a standard font. This guaranteed its importance in digital and desktop publishing and made it (or a variant of it) a preinstalled font on most computers. As with many popular fonts, knockoff designs and rereleases under different names are common. Zapf retained an interest in the design, and continued to collaborate on new versions into his eighties.

==Palatino family==
===Palatino===

Palatino itself, as previously noted, has a solid structure, intended to read clearly on poor-quality paper and printing. Zapf&#x27;s friend Alexander Lawson wrote that &quot;the open counters that make Palatino such a legible letter were provided to overcome a then current printing problem in Germany, poor-quality paper. The weight of the type was also thickened beyond that of a normal roman in order to adapt to the lithographic and gravure printing processes of that period. Zapf has steadily maintained that he did not create Palatino as a book type but rather as a commercial face.&quot;

Due to Palatino&#x27;s increasing popularity in body text, multiple versions have been released for the changing technologies of handsetting, hot metal typesetting, phototypesetting and digital font design. Later versions often have regularised details such as a lower &#x27;t&#x27; and foot serifs on &#x27;p&#x27; and &#x27;q&#x27;. The italic in particular has gone through several redesigns, with the original for hand-set foundry type being distinctly narrow, the version for the Linotype machine distinctly wide to enable duplexing with the roman, and the versions for subsequent photosetting and digital technologies being in between the two extremes. Hutner and Kelly have described Palatino as &quot;distinctly modern... a modern type not copied from any specific early model.&quot;

Palatino&#x27;s italic in metal type included a set of swash capitals. These have not been found in digitisations, although digitisations of Zapf&#x27;s Renaissance Antiqua design (discussed below) do include a (slightly different) set. Later versions alter the descenders on many letters; Zapf originally had to keep these short to fit on the German common line standard, optimised for blackletter typefaces; later versions escape this restriction.

===Aldus===
Aldus is an old-style serif design, popular for use in book printing. Compared to Palatino, released some years earlier, it has a more condensed design lighter in colour, more graceful and refined and better suited to the high average quality of book printing. Aldus has a non-kerning roman and italic &quot;f&quot;, allowing the typographer to avoid ligatures. It appeared in the D. Stempel AG catalog in 1954 and Zapf used it to set his own &quot;Manuale Typographicum&quot;, a history of letter design.

Aldus is named for the Venetian Renaissance printer Aldus Manutius. The decision annoyed Zapf (who preferred the name &quot;Palatino Book&quot;) since it bears little direct resemblance to Aldus&#x27;s typefaces.

Like Palatino, an upgraded digitisation, Aldus Nova, has been released by Linotype.

===Michelangelo===
A set of titling capitals, based on Roman square capitals. The design has a &#x27;U&#x27; with a foot serif at bottom right, a &#x27;double-V&#x27;-style &#x27;W&#x27; with four top terminals and a &#x27;palm Y&#x27; similar to that on Palatino, inspired by the Greek letter upsilon. It was renamed &quot;Palatino Titling&quot; in the Palatino nova release (see below), since the rights to the name were held by Berthold who also published a digitisation.

===Sistina===
A slightly bolder set of titling capitals than Michaelangelo on the same basic structure. It was originally named &#x27;Aurelia Titling&#x27; after the Roman road named Via Aurelia; Zapf would later use the name for another separate font. The Palatino nova version (see below) is renamed &quot;Palatino Imperial&quot; and has small capitals as a lower case. It was created following an artistically productive 1950 visit to Italy, which Zapf had been unable to visit before. Zapf was very interested in the quality of Italian art and lettering, and his sketches of stonecarving in Florence also inspired the humanist sans-serif Optima.

===Kompakt===
An ultra-bold display type, with a slight slope but roman rather than italic letter forms. Unlike Palatino, it is very unlike the style of roman type printing used during the Renaissance, which did not use bold type.
===Zapf Renaissance Antiqua (1984–1986)===
Not part of Stempel&#x27;s metal Palatino family, Zapf Renaissance Antiqua is a separate interpretation by Zapf of the same Renaissance models dating to 1984–1986, initially created for Scangraphic and later digitised and sold by Linotype along with Palatino. Compared to Palatino, Zapf Renaissance Antiqua has greater stroke contrast, which carries through to the sharp serifs and wedge-like punctuation marks, but it also features smoother transitions between thick and thin strokes. It is also notable for including a full set of swash letterforms, with as many as five variants of each lowercase letter – something not included on digital versions of Palatino. According to Linotype the currently available digitisation is based on the versions prepared by Scangraphic for display use, with tight spacing and striking contrasts in stroke weight. A version marketed under the name “Zapf Renaissance Antiqua SB” contains these same high-contrast letterforms, but with looser spacing for running text. However, some typographers have criticized the poor quality of the spacing in all available digitizations, attributing it to an inaccurate conversion from its original, proprietary digital format into PostScript.

==Variants and similar typefaces==

===Digitisations===
Palatino&#x27;s early digitisation intended for PostScript use is very widely used or cloned. Later Palatino digitisations have different features and spacing. In 1999, Zapf revised Palatino for Linotype and Microsoft, called Palatino Linotype. The revised family incorporated extended Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic character sets. Linotype released a more complex redesign named Palatino nova, together with digitisations of some of Zapf&#x27;s other Renaissance-inspired designs and Aldus. Zapf also created a matching Palatino Sans and Palatino Sans Informal design in 2006.

===Palatino Linotype===
Palatino Linotype is the version of the Palatino family included with modern versions of Microsoft software. It incorporates extended Latin, Greek, Cyrillic characters, as well as currency signs, subscripts and superscripts, and fractions. The family includes roman and italic in text and bold weights.

Palatino Linotype was notable as being the first western OpenType font that Microsoft shipped; Palatino Linotype was bundled with Windows 2000. The OpenType version showcased some (then new) alternate features, including ligatures, true small caps, proportional and tabular figures, text figures and a variety of special alternate characters, such as the swash Capital Qu combination. This marks it out from earlier digitisations such as the OS X system version, which do not include ligatures such as &quot;Th&quot; and &quot;Qu&quot;. On release it was one of the few fonts to incorporate an interrobang.

===Palatino nova===
Palatino nova is a redesigned version of Palatino, by Hermann Zapf and Akira Kobayashi. This Palatino nova typeface family includes roman and italics in the light, text, medium, and bold weights, a new release of Aldus and versions of Michelangelo and Sistina under the name of &quot;Palatino Titling&quot; and &quot;Palatino Imperial&quot;.

The font family was premiered on November 24, 2005, the same day as Hermann Zapf&#x27;s 87th birthday celebration. A new digitisation of Aldus named Aldus nova was created at the same time.

===Palatino Sans===
Palatino Sans is a sans-serif design with stroke width modulation, resembling Zapf&#x27;s classic design Optima but with a softer, more organic feel. Unlike the serifed counterpart, the Sans families do not have full Greek or Cyrillic characters. Reviewing it for &quot;Typographica&quot; on release, font designer Hrant Papazian commented:
The confluence of competence, freedom and kiai... evident in Palatino Sans is breathtaking. The sober organicity, the bravado of the raised &#x27;r&#x27;, the confident flair of the italic; all done before, but never in such a usable, contemporary whole.

====Palatino Sans Informal====
Palatino Sans Informal incorporates informal characteristics to the Palatino Sans, such as asymmetrical A, K, N, W, X, Y, w.

===Palatino Arabic===
It is a family designed by Lebanese designer Nadine Chahine and Hermann Zapf. The design is based on the Al-Ahram typeface designed by Zapf in 1956 but reworked and modified to fit the Palatino nova family. The design is Naskh in style but with a strong influence of Thuluth style.

This family only comes in 1 font, with the Arabic characters based on Palatino nova Regular. It supports basic Latin, Arabic, Persian, and Urdu scripts. Chahine also created a version of Zapf&#x27;s Zapfino.

===Palatino eText (2013)===
It is a family designed by Toshi Omagari of Monotype Imaging, optimised for on-screen use. It includes a larger x-height and wider spacing. It is the standard four-font family, with bolds and italics.

==Palatino clones==
As one of the most iconic typefaces of the twentieth century, derivative designs based on Palatino were rapidly developed, taking advantage of the lack of practical copyright and the easy copying possible in the phototypesetting font market of the 1960s and 70s onwards. Many of these are almost indistinguishable from Palatino, and some even had Zapf&#x27;s involvement as a consultant.

===Palazzo Original===
Softmaker&#x27;s clone of Palatino, Palazzo Original, is unique for being based on the original metal type of Palatino: as a result, it contains many design features not seen in the digital versions of Palatino endorsed by Zapf and most clones. These include a &#x27;p&#x27; and &#x27;q&#x27; without foot serif and no serif on the centre stroke of the &#x27;E&#x27; and &#x27;F&#x27;, as well as a slightly more delicate design with a lower x-height. It has also been released as Marathon Serial without italics.

===PostScript clones===

Most modern Palatino clones are set to match the spacing and design of the PostScript version of Palatino that was a standard font in early digital publishing. In the Bitstream font collection, the Palatino equivalent is called &quot;Zapf Calligraphic&quot;.

URW++ sells its version as &quot;URW Palladio L&quot;. A version of this font was later released by URW under a free and open-source licence as part of the Ghostscript project to develop an open-source alternative to PostScript. As a result, it (or a derivative) is used by much open-source software such as R as a system font. Palladio, however, lacks the subtle stroke modulation and rounded corners which can be found for example in Palatino Linotype.

====Book Antiqua====
One of the best-known Palatino PostScript clones is &quot;Book Antiqua&quot; (originally by Monotype), distributed with much Microsoft software, beginning with Microsoft Windows. It is one of many clone PostScript typefaces distributed by Microsoft and Monotype around this time, including Arial (similar to Helvetica), Century Gothic (ITC Avant Garde) and Bookman Old Style (ITC Bookman). Book Antiqua resembles Palatino extremely closely and is almost indistinguishable from the original apart from a few detail differences. (&quot;Antiqua&quot; is another word for the &quot;Roman&quot; style of typefaces that Palatino is based on, as opposed to blackletter. The genre, inspired by Italian traditions of handwriting and calligraphy, has been a dominant influence on most typefaces and lettering created in the Western world since the Renaissance.)

In 1993, Zapf resigned from l&#x27;Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI) over what he viewed as its hypocritical attitude toward unauthorized copying by prominent ATypI members (namely Monotype). In the United States, the abstract design of a typeface is not protected by copyright, and can be imitated freely (unless the typeface is protected by a design patent, which is of much more limited duration and rarely applied for). Copyright protection is available for the representation of a typeface in software (a computer font), and the names of typefaces can be protected by trademark.

Microsoft has since licensed and distributes Linotype&#x27;s version of Zapf&#x27;s original design called &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot; in all versions of Windows since Windows 2000. During the Palatino Linotype development process, Zapf and Linotype requested that Microsoft cease to include Book Antiqua with Office, but Microsoft concluded that this was impossible as too many documents had already been created using it. A custom version of Book Antiqua was created by Monotype as a corporate font for the Parliament of the UK.

===Free and open-source versions and derivatives===
The first legal free version of Palatino was URW Palladio L. The open-source community greatly extended the character sets of the fonts and releases new, updated versions under new names.

*FPL Neu is a typeface based on &quot;URW Palladio L&quot; font. It has both text figures and lining figures. It is available both in Type 1 format and OpenType format.
*TeX Gyre Pagella is another similar typeface based on the &quot;URW Palladio L&quot; font. Pagella includes accents for European languages as well as glyphs for a few non-European languages. This typeface is released in formats compatible with LaTeX as well as with modern OpenType compatible systems. It is a part of the TeX Gyre project to make updated, expanded, OpenType versions of URW&#x27;s open-source fonts.
*Domitian is a typeface based on &quot;URW Palladio L&quot; font released recently in 2020. It was meant to be a drop in of Adobe Palatino, and extends more characters on top of Palladio.

Asana Math is an OpenType mathematical font designed to look like Palatino (so that math can visually match the text). It is based on the Type 1 &quot;pxfonts&quot; by Young Ryu.

==Awards==

Palatino Sans and Palatino Sans Informal won Type Directors Club Type Design Competition 2007 award under Type System / Superfamily category.

Palatino Arabic won 2008 Type Directors Club TDC2 2008 award under Text / Type Family category.

The Aldine type of the Italian renaissance is one of the most influential typefaces in history. Copies based in it made by printers in Paris from the 1530s onwards by engravers such as Claude Garamond became the main style of type used in Europe, and influenced most successive type styles such as those of the Dutch renaissance. Other Aldine roman-influenced revivals include:
* Bembo by Monotype (1929), very popular in book printing.
* Dante designed by Giovanni Mardersteig and also released by Monotype.
* Minion by Robert Slimbach of Adobe Systems.
* Requiem by Jonathan Hoefler.

<text>Optima is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Hermann Zapf and released by the D. Stempel AG foundry, Frankfurt, West Germany in 1958.

Though classified as a sans-serif, Optima has a subtle swelling at the terminals suggesting a glyphic serif. Optima was inspired by classical Roman capitals and the stonecarving on Renaissance-period tombstones Zapf saw in Florence on a 1950 holiday to Italy.

Zapf intended Optima to be a typeface that could serve for both body text and titling. To prove its versatility, Zapf set his entire book &quot;About Alphabets&quot; in the regular weight. Zapf retained an interest in the design, collaborating on variants and expansions into his eighties.

== History ==

Interested in calligraphy and the history of Italian printing and lettering, Zapf first visited Italy in 1950. While in Florence, Zapf was particularly interested in the design of the lettering in tombstones of the cemetery of the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence, in which the strokes subtly widen as they reach stroke terminals without ending in a serif. He quickly sketched an early draft of the design on a 1000 lira banknote. Zapf was to work on the development of Optima during most of the following decade.

In his book &quot;About Alphabets&quot;, Zapf commented that his key aim in designing Optima&#x27;s capitals, inspired by the Roman capital model, was the desire to avoid the monotony of all capital letters having a roughly square footprint, as he felt was true of some early sans-serif designs. Like the Roman capitals, Optima&#x27;s &#x27;E&#x27; and &#x27;R&#x27; occupy about a half-square, the &#x27;M&#x27; is wide and its sides are splayed.

On the suggestion of Monroe Wheeler of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Zapf decided to adapt his typeface to be used as a book type. &quot;He thereupon changed the proportions of the lowercase, and by means of photography, he tested the suitability of the design for continuous reading application.&quot; Zapf designed the capital letters of Optima after the inscriptions on the Trajan Column (A.D. 113). Optima was the first German typeface not based on the standard baseline alignment. Zapf stated: &quot;This base line is not ideal for a roman, as it was designed for the high x-height of the Fraktur and Textura letters. Thus, too many German types have ascenders which are too long and descenders which are too short. The proportions of Optima Roman are now in the Golden Section: lowercase x-height equalling the minor and ascenders-descenders the major. However, the curved lines of the stems of each letter result from technical considerations of type manufacturing rather than purely esthetic considerations.&quot;

The development of Optima occurred during the period 1955–1958. Optima was first manufactured as a foundry version in 1958 by Stempel of Frankfurt, and by Mergenthaler in America shortly thereafter. It was released to the public at an exhibition in Düsseldorf the same year. Zapf himself wanted to name the new type face &quot;New Roman&quot;, but the marketing staff insisted that it be named &quot;Optima&quot;. In a memoir written for Linotype, Zapf commented: 

Zapf wrote later in his life of his preference for Optima over all of his other typefaces, but he also mentioned “a father should not have a favorite among his daughters.”

==Structure==
Optima&#x27;s design follows humanist lines; its capitals (like those of Palatino, Hans Eduard Meier&#x27;s Syntax and Carol Twombly&#x27;s Trajan) originate from the classic Roman monumental capital model, reflecting a reverence for Roman capitals as an ideal form.

Optima is an example of a modulated-stroke sans-serif, a design type where the strokes are variable in width. The design style has been intermittently favored since the late nineteenth century; Optima is one of the most lasting examples of the genre. Optima was originally targeted by Stempel&#x27;s Walter Cunz as a competitor to Ludwig &amp; Mayer&#x27;s Colonia design, which has not been digitised. Shaw also suggests the little-known 1948 design Romann Antiqua, as well as Stellar by Robert Hunter Middleton as predecessors, and notes the existence of Pascal by José Mendoza y Almeida (1962) as a design with a similar set of influences. Optima is however quite restrained in stroke width variation; more display-oriented predecessors such as Britannic show far more differentiation in stroke width than Optima does.

Optima&#x27;s sloped version was originally an oblique or sloped roman, in which the letters do not take on handwriting characteristics. For Optima nova (discussed below) Zapf decided to create a new true italic with a greater slant angle.

During late development of Optima, Zapf also began working on a non-modulated sans for Linotype, to be named Magnus and intended to compete with Gill Sans. It has never been released.

==Optima Greek (1973)==
A Greek variant designed by Matthew Carter, based on sketches from Hermann Zapf. No digital versions have been produced.

==Optima Classified (1976)==
A variant designed by Matthew Carter, based closely on Optima Medium. No digital versions have been produced.

==Optima nova (2002)==

&quot;Optima nova&quot; is a redesign of the original font family, designed by Hermann Zapf and Linotype GmbH type director Akira Kobayashi. The new family contains seven font weights, adding light, demi, and heavy font weights, but removing extra black weight. Medium weight is readjusted to between medium and bold weights in the old family scale. Glyph sets are expanded to include Adobe CE and Latin Extended characters, with light to bold weight fonts supporting proportional lining figures, old style figures, and small caps.

The initial and most common release of Optima, like many sans-serif fonts, has an oblique style instead of an italic: the shapes are merely tilted to the right. In Optima nova, this is replaced by a true italic. (In interviews, Zapf has said that this was his original goal from the beginning, but the need to release Optima quickly forced him to settle for an oblique.)

Even in Roman fonts, letters such as Q, a, f are redesigned. The overall bounding boxes were widened in Optima nova.

Reviewing it, John Berry wrote that &quot;its &#x27;color&#x27; on the page comes much closer to that of the original metal version than any of the earlier photo/digital versions did&quot; but that &quot;ends of the strokes in the letters &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;, and &#x27;s&#x27; flare much more dramatically than they ever did in the older Optima — so much so that these letters almost look as though they have serifs...It’s a subtle difference, but it’s disturbing if you’re used to the understated elegance of Optima’s letterforms.&quot;

===Optima nova Condensed===
A condensed variant which consists of light to bold weights, but no italic fonts. The glyph set does not support proportional lining figures, old style figures, or small caps.

===Optima nova Titling===
A titling capitals variant, which contains only capital letters, with restyled letterform. The glyph set is the same as &quot;Optima nova Condensed&quot;, but also includes extra ligatures. Berry writes in his review of the &quot;nova&quot; release: &quot;it has softly curved joins and interior angles. Instead of the added crispness of detail that you might expect of a face designed for display use, this one looks more sculptural.&quot;

In the tradition of hand lettering and lapidary inscription, the titling face shares similarities with the work of Zapf&#x27;s friend Herb Lubalin, especially the exuberant ligatures (for which Lubalin&#x27;s ITC Lubalin Graph and ITC Avant Garde are notable). Further influence of A.M. Cassandre and Rudolf Koch, whose work greatly inspired the young Zapf, can also be seen in Optima.

==Optima Pro Cyrillic (2010)==
In April 2010, Linotype announced the release of Cyrillic version of the original Optima family, in OpenType Pro font formats. Released fonts include Optima Pro Cyrillic Roman, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique.

==Derivatives==
As with many commonly used fonts, knockoff designs and re-releases under different names have been released, some created by Zapf himself. These all tend to copy the original version, rather than the Optima nova design which represents Zapf&#x27;s final thoughts on the design. In the Bitstream font collection, Zapf Humanist 601 is provided as an Optima clone. Other Optima clones include Optane from the WSI Fonts collection, Opulent by Rubicon Computer Labs Inc., Ottawa from Corel, CG Omega and Eterna. Freely available implementations include URW Classico (available with URW Font package from Ghostscript). Linux Biolinum and Libertinus Sans are libre fonts inspired by it. Zapf&#x27;s Palatino Sans is a more informal typeface in the same style, with a design reminiscent of brushstrokes or calligraphy.

Kontour Type designed the Utile Display typeface, inspired from the Optima typeface.

==Notable usages==
 Optima is used for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington and used in the official logo and most publications associated with Expo 67 in Montreal.

Optima was chosen as the font to be used for the names of those who lost their lives in the September 11 attacks, carved into bronze parapets, at the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum, which is named &quot;Reflecting Absence&quot;. More recently, was used by U.S. politician John McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign.

Opinions on the design have been variable, partly because of its extensive use. Erik Spiekermann described it as &quot;used on parking garages &amp; hospitals across the United States. Tired &amp; inappropriate. I don’t blame the typeface but the designers.&quot; He also commented &quot;Optima is patronizing. It hasn&#x27;t got the guts to be either a proper Sans or Serif, so it keeps all its options open and appeals to the middle...It suits everything and pleases nobody.&quot;

Jonathan Hoefler described it as &quot;signifying a very down-market notion of luxe...the font of choice for the hygiene aisle.&quot;

<text>Hermann Zapf (; 8 November 1918 – 4 June 2015) was a German type designer and calligrapher who lived in Darmstadt, Germany. He was married to the calligrapher and typeface designer Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse. Typefaces he designed include Palatino, Optima, and Zapfino. He is considered one of the greatest type designers of all time.

== Early life ==
Zapf was born in Nuremberg during turbulent times marked by the German Revolution of 1918–1919 in Munich and Berlin, the end of World War I, the exile of Kaiser Wilhelm, and the establishment of Bavaria as a free state by Kurt Eisner. In addition, the Spanish flu pandemic took hold in Europe in 1918 and 1919. Two of Zapf&#x27;s siblings died of the disease. Famine later struck Germany, and Zapf&#x27;s mother was grateful to send him to school in 1925, where he received daily meals in a program organized by Herbert Hoover. In school, Zapf was mainly interested in technical subjects. One of his favorite books was the annual science journal &quot;Das neue Universum&quot; (The New Universe). He and his older brother experimented with electricity, building a crystal radio and an alarm system for his house. Even at this early age, Zapf was already getting involved with type, inventing cipher alphabets to exchange secret messages with his brother.

Zapf left school in 1933 with the ambition of pursuing a career in electrical engineering. However, his father had become unemployed and was in trouble with the newly established Third Reich, having been involved with trade unions, and was sent to the Dachau concentration camp for a short time.

== Introduction to typography ==
Under the new political regime, Zapf was not able to attend the Ohm Technical Institute in Nuremberg, and therefore he needed to find an apprenticeship. His teachers, aware of the new political difficulties, noticed Zapf&#x27;s skill in drawing and suggested that he become a lithographer. Each company that interviewed him for an apprenticeship would ask him political questions, and every time he was interviewed, he was complimented on his work but was rejected. Ten months later, in 1934, he was interviewed by the last company in the telephone directory, and the company did not ask any political questions. They also complimented Zapf&#x27;s work, but did not do lithography and did not need an apprentice lithographer. However, they allowed him to become a retoucher, and Zapf began his four-year apprenticeship in February 1934.

In 1935, Zapf attended an exhibition in Nuremberg in honor of the late typographer Rudolf Koch. This exhibition gave him his first interest in lettering. Zapf bought two books there, using them to teach himself calligraphy. He also studied examples of calligraphy in the Nuremberg city library. Soon, his master noticed his expertise in calligraphy, and Zapf&#x27;s work shifted to retouching lettering and improving his colleagues&#x27; retouching.

== Frankfurt ==
A few days after finishing his apprenticeship, Zapf left for Frankfurt. He did not bear a journeyman&#x27;s certificate and thus would not be able to get a work permit at another company in Nuremberg, as they would not have been able to check on his qualifications. Zapf went to the Werkstatt Haus zum Fürsteneck, a building run by Paul Koch, son of Rudolf Koch. He spent most of his time there working in typography and writing songbooks.

Through print historian Gustav Mori, Zapf came into contact with the type foundries D. Stempel, AG, and Linotype GmbH of Frankfurt. In 1938, he designed his first printed typeface for them, Gilgengart, a Fraktur.

== War service ==
On 1 April 1939, Zapf was conscripted and sent to Pirmasens to help reinforce the Siegfried Line against France. As a consequence of hard labor, he developed heart trouble in a few weeks and was given a desk job, writing camp records and sports certificates in Fraktur.

World War II broke out in September, and Zapf&#x27;s unit was to be taken into the Wehrmacht. However, because of his heart trouble, Zapf was not transferred to the Wehrmacht but was instead dismissed. On 1 April 1942, he was summoned again for the war effort. Zapf had been chosen for the Luftwaffe, but instead was sent to the artillery in Weimar. He did not perform well, confusing left and right during training and being too cautious and clumsy with his gun. His officers soon brought an unusually early end to his career in the artillery.

Zapf was sent back to the office and then to Jüterbog to train as a cartographer. After that, he went to Dijon and then Bordeaux, joining the staff of the First Army. In the cartography unit at Bordeaux, Zapf drew maps of Spain, especially the railway system, which could have been used to transport artillery had Francisco Franco not used narrow-gauge tracks to repair bridges after the Spanish Civil War. Zapf was happy in the cartography unit. His eyesight was so good that he could write letters 1 millimeter in height without using a magnifying glass, and this skill probably prevented him from being commissioned back into the army.

After the war had ended, Zapf was held by the French as a prisoner of war at a field hospital in Tübingen. He was treated with respect because of his artwork and, on account of his poor health, was sent home only four weeks after the end of the war. He went back to Nuremberg, which had suffered great damage in air raids.

== Postwar career ==
Zapf taught calligraphy in Nuremberg in 1946. He returned to Frankfurt in 1947, where the type foundry Stempel offered him a position as artistic head of their printshop. They did not ask for qualifications, certificates, or references, but instead only required him to show them his sketchbooks from the war and a calligraphic piece he did in 1944 of Hans von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Junggesellentext&quot;.

One of Zapf&#x27;s projects was the book &quot;Feder und Stichel&quot; (&quot;Pen and Graver&quot;), printed from metal plates designed by Zapf and cut by the punchcutter August Rosenberger during the war. It was printed at the Stempel printshop in 1949.

From 1948 to 1950, Zapf taught calligraphy at the Arts and Crafts School in Offenbach, giving lettering lessons twice a week to two classes of graphics students. On 1 August 1951 he married Gudrun von Hesse, who taught at the school of Städel in Frankfurt.

Most of Zapf&#x27;s work as a graphic artist was in book design. He worked for various publishing houses, including Suhrkamp Verlag, Insel Verlag, Büchergilde Gutenberg, Hanser Verlag, Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, and Verlag Philipp von Zabern.

== Type design ==
Zapf&#x27;s career in type design spanned the three most recent stages of printing: hot metal composition, phototypesetting (also called cold type), and digital typesetting. His two most famous typefaces, Palatino and Optima, were designed in 1948 and 1952, respectively. Palatino was designed in conjunction with August Rosenberger, with careful attention to detail. It was named after the 16th-century Italian writing master Giambattista Palatino. It became better known after it became one of the core 35 PostScript fonts in 1984, bundled with virtually all PostScript devices from laser printers to imagesetters. Optima, a flared sans-serif, was released by Stempel in 1958. Zapf intended the design to bridge serifs and sans serifs and to be suitable for both headings and continuous passages of text.
Zapf&#x27;s work reached into a range of genres. Palatino is a warm, organic design inspired by Italian Renaissance calligraphy and printing. Melior suggests the work of the great German neoclassical printer Justus Erich Walbaum but also is based on the mathematical &quot;super-ellipse&quot;. His sans serif series URW Grotesk was designed for newspaper use and presents a wide range of widths and weights, reminiscent of geometric sans serif fonts like Futura but in a more eccentric style. Dan Margulis commented on his death that &quot;you would have to say that his historical standing will be based on the first ten years of his professional career.&quot;

Zapf&#x27;s later releases for Linotype in the 1990s and 2000s, often created in collaboration with Akira Kobayashi, were radical reformations of his previous work, often removing compromises that had been necessary in the manufacture of metal type. In this period he created Palatino Sans, a more informal modulated sans serif than Optima.

Zapf&#x27;s typefaces have been widely copied, sometimes against his will. The best-known example may be Monotype&#x27;s Book Antiqua, which was included in Microsoft Office and is often considered an imitation of Palatino. In 1993, Zapf resigned from ATypI (Association Typographique Internationale) over what he viewed as its hypocritical attitude toward unauthorized copying by prominent ATypI members. At a 1994 conference of the Raster Imaging and Digital Typography association in Darmstadt, Germany, a panel discussion on digital typefaces and designers&#x27; rights strongly criticized the alleged plagiarism of Zapf&#x27;s Palatino, while several Microsoft attendees listened in the audience. In 1999, Microsoft worked with Zapf and Linotype to develop a new, authorized version of Palatino for Microsoft, called Palatino Linotype.

Sometimes, however, Zapf worked with a font maker to make new versions of his existing typefaces created for another company. For example, in the 1980s Zapf worked with Bitstream to make versions of many of his prior typefaces, including Palatino, Optima and Melior, all with &quot;Zapf&quot; in their new names.

== Calligraphy ==
Zapf is considered one of the great calligraphers, but he did not work extensively doing commercial lettering and calligraphy. His largest calligraphic project was the &quot;Preamble to the United Nations Charter&quot;, written in four languages, commissioned by the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York in 1960, for which he received $1000. But his ideas about calligraphy indirectly influenced the look of the mid-20th century as he served as a consultant to Hallmark Cards throughout the 1960s and 70s, helping them to develop a style manual for their lettering artists. His calligraphy was primarily limited to studies and personal works of art. He also taught calligraphy as a part of his workshops every summer at Rochester Institute of Technology during the 1980s.

== Computer typography ==

Zapf worked on typography for computer programs from the 1960s onwards. His ideas were considered radical, not taken seriously in West Germany, and rejected by the Technische Universität Darmstadt, where he lectured from 1972 to 1981. Because he had no success in Germany, Zapf went to the United States, where he lectured about computerized typesetting, and was invited to speak at Harvard University in 1964. The University of Texas at Austin was also interested in Zapf and offered him a professorship, which he did not take, because his wife opposed a move to that state.

Because Zapf&#x27;s plans for the United States had come to nothing, and because their house in Frankfurt had become too small, Zapf and his wife moved to Darmstadt in 1972.

In 1976, Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) offered Zapf a professorship in typographic computer programming, the first of its kind in the world. He taught there from 1977 to 1987, flying between Darmstadt and Rochester. There he developed his ideas further, with the help of his connections in companies such as IBM and Xerox and his discussions with computer specialists at Rochester. A number of Zapf&#x27;s students from this time at RIT went on to become influential type designers, including Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow, who together created the Lucida type family. Other prominent students include the calligrapher and type designer Julian Waters and book designer Jerry Kelly.

In 1977, Zapf and his friends Aaron Burns and Herb Lubalin founded Design Processing International, Inc., in New York and developed typographical computer software. It existed until 1986, when Lubalin died. Zapf and Burns founded Zapf, Burns &amp; Company in 1987. Burns, also an expert in typeface design and typography, was in charge of marketing until his death in 1992. Shortly before, two of their employees had stolen Zapf&#x27;s ideas and founded a company of their own.

Zapf knew that he could not run an American company from Darmstadt and did not want to move to New York. Instead, he used his experience to begin the development of a typesetting program, the &quot;Hz-program&quot;, building on the hyphenation and justification system in TeX.

During financial problems and bankruptcy of URW++ in the mid-1990s, Adobe Systems acquired the Hz patent(s) and later made some use of the concepts in their InDesign program.

== Zapfino ==

In 1983, Zapf completed the typeface &quot;AMS Euler&quot; with Donald Knuth and graduate students in Knuth&#x27;s and Charles Bigelow&#x27;s digital typography program at Stanford University, including students Dan Mills, Carol Twombly, and David Siegel and Knuth&#x27;s computer science PhD students Scott Kim and John Hobby, for the American Mathematical Society. Euler digital font production was eventually finished by Siegel as his M.S. thesis project in 1985. Euler is a typeface family for mathematical composition including Latin, Fraktur and Greek letters. After Siegel finished his studies at Stanford and was interested in entering the field of typography, he told Zapf his idea of making a typeface with a large number of glyph variations and wanted to start with an example of Zapf&#x27;s calligraphy, which had been reproduced in a publication of the Society of Typographic Arts in Chicago.

Zapf was concerned that this was the wrong way to go, and while he was interested in creating a complicated program, he was worried about starting something new. However, Zapf remembered a page of calligraphy from his sketchbook from 1944 and considered the possibility of making a typeface from it. He had tried to create a calligraphic typeface for Stempel in 1948, but hot metal composition placed too many limits on the freedom of swash characters. Such a pleasing result could only be achieved using modern digital technology, and so Zapf and Siegel began work on the complicated software necessary. Siegel also hired Gino Lee, a programmer from Boston, Massachusetts, to work on the project.

However, just before the project was completed, Siegel wrote a letter to Zapf, saying that his girlfriend had left him and that he had lost all interest in anything. Siegel abandoned the project and started a new life, working on bringing color to Macintosh computers and later becoming an Internet design expert.

The development of Zapfino had become seriously delayed until Zapf presented the project to Linotype. The company was prepared to complete it and reorganized the project. Zapf worked with Linotype to create four alphabets and various ornaments, flourishes, and other dingbats. Zapfino was released in 1998.

Later versions of Zapfino using the Apple Advanced Typography and OpenType technologies were able to make automatic ligatures and glyph substitutions (especially contextual ones, in which the nature of ligatures and substituted glyphs is determined by other glyphs nearby or even in different words), to more accurately reflect the fluid and dynamic nature of Zapf&#x27;s calligraphy.

== Death ==
Zapf died on 4 June 2015, at the age of 96 in Darmstadt, Germany.

<text>A drum machine is an electronic musical instrument that creates percussion sounds, drum beats, and patterns. Drum machines may imitate drum kits or other percussion instruments, or produce unique sounds, such as synthesized electronic tones. A drum machine often has pre-programmed beats and patterns for popular genres and styles, such as pop music, rock music, and dance music. Most modern drum machines made in the 2010s and 2020s also allow users to program their own rhythms and beats. Drum machines may create sounds using analog synthesis or play prerecorded samples.

While a distinction is generally made between drum machines (which can play back pre-programmed or user-programmed beats or patterns) and electronic drums (which have pads that can be struck and played like an acoustic drum kit), there are some drum machines that have buttons or pads that allow the performer to play drum sounds &quot;live&quot;, either on top of a programmed drum beat or as a standalone performance. Drum machines have a range of capabilities, which go from playing a short beat pattern in a loop, to being able to program or record complex song arrangements with changes of meter and style.

Drum machines have had a lasting impact on popular music in the 20th century. The Roland TR-808, introduced in 1980, significantly influenced the development of dance music, especially electronic dance music, and hip hop. Its successor, the TR-909, introduced in 1983, heavily influenced techno and house music. The first drum machine to use samples of real drum kits, the Linn LM-1, was introduced in 1980 and was adopted by rock and pop artists including Prince and Michael Jackson. In the late 1990s, software emulations began to overtake the popularity of physical drum machines housed in a separate plastic or metal chassis.

==History==
=== Rhythmicon (1930–1932) ===

In 1930–32, the innovative and hard-to-use &quot;Rhythmicon&quot; was developed by Léon Theremin at the request of Henry Cowell, who wanted an instrument that could play compositions with multiple rhythmic patterns, based on the overtone series, that were far too hard to perform on existing keyboard instruments. The invention could produce sixteen different rhythms, each associated with a particular pitch, either individually or in any combination, including en masse, if desired. Received with considerable interest when it was publicly introduced in 1932, the Rhythmicon was soon set aside by Cowell.

=== Chamberlin Rhythmate (1957) ===
In 1957, Harry Chamberlin, an engineer from Iowa, created the Chamberlin Rhythmate, which allowed users to select between 14 tape loops of drum kits and percussion instruments performing various beats. Like the Chamberlin keyboard, the Rhythmate was intended for family singalongs. Around 100 units were sold.

=== Wurlitzer Side Man (1959) ===

In 1959, Wurlitzer released the Side Man, which generates sounds mechanically by a rotating disc, similar to a music box. A slider controls the tempo (between 34 and 150 beats per minute). Sounds can also be triggered individually through buttons on a control panel. The Side Man was a success and drew criticism from the American Federation of Musicians, which ruled in 1961 that its local jurisdictions could not prohibit Side Man use, though it could not be used for dancing. Wurlitzer ceased production of the Side Man in 1969.

=== Raymond Scott (1960–1963) ===
In 1960, Raymond Scott constructed the &quot;Rhythm Synthesizer&quot; and, in 1963, a drum machine called &quot;Bandito the Bongo Artist&quot;. Scott&#x27;s machines were used for recording his album &quot;Soothing Sounds for Baby&quot; series (1964).

=== First fully transistorized drum machines – Seeburg/Gulbransen (1964) ===
During the 1960s, the implementation of rhythm machines had evolved into fully solid-state (transistorized) from early electro-mechanical with vacuum tubes, and also size was reduced to desktop size from earlier floor type. In the early 1960s, a home organ manufacturer, Gulbransen (later acquired by Fender) cooperated with an automatic musical equipment manufacturer Seeburg Corporation, and released early compact rhythm machines &quot;Rhythm Prince&quot; (PRP), although, at that time, these sizes were still as large as small guitar amp head, due to the use of bulky electro-mechanical pattern generators. Then in 1964, Seeburg invented a compact electronic rhythm pattern generator using &quot;diode matrix&quot; ( in 1967), and fully transistorized electronic rhythm machine with pre-programmed patterns, &quot;Select-A-Rhythm&quot; (SAR1), was released. As a result of its robustness and enough compact size, these rhythm machines were gradually installed on the electronic organ as an accompaniment of organists and finally spread widely.

====Keio-Giken (Korg), Nippon Columbia, and Ace Tone (1963–1967)====

In the early 1960s, a nightclub owner in Tokyo, Tsutomu Katoh was consulted by a notable accordion player, Tadashi Osanai, about the rhythm machine he used for accompaniment in the club, a Wurlitzer Side Man. Osanai, a graduate of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Tokyo, convinced Katoh to finance his efforts to build a better one. In 1963, their new company Keio-Giken (later Korg) released their first rhythm machine, the Donca-Matic DA-20, using vacuum tube circuits for sounds and a mechanical wheel for rhythm patterns. It was a floor-type machine with a built-in speaker, and featured a keyboard for manual play, in addition to the multiple automatic rhythm patterns. Its price was comparable with the average annual income of Japanese at that time.

Next, their effort was focused on the improvement of reliability and performance, along with size and cost reductions. Unstable vacuum tube circuits were replaced with reliable transistor circuits on the Donca-Matic DC-11 in the mid-1960s. In 1966, the bulky mechanical wheel was also replaced with a compact transistor circuit on the Donca-Matic DE-20 and DE-11. In 1967, the Mini Pops MP-2 was developed as an option for the Yamaha Electone (electric organ), and Mini Pops was established as a series of compact desktop rhythm machines. In the United States, Mini Pops MP-3, MP-7, etc. were sold under the Univox brand by the distributor at that time, Unicord Corporation.

In 1965, Nippon Columbia filed a patent for an automatic rhythm instrument. It described it as an &quot;automatic rhythm player which is simple but capable of electronically producing various rhythms in the characteristic tones of a drum, a piccolo and so on.&quot; It has some similarities to Seeburg&#x27;s slightly earlier 1964 patent.

In 1967, Ace Tone founder Ikutaro Kakehashi (later founder of Roland Corporation) developed the preset rhythm-pattern generator using &quot;diode matrix&quot; circuit, which has some similarities to the earlier Seeburg and Nippon Columbia patents. Kakehashi&#x27;s patent describes his device as a &quot;plurality of inverting circuits and/or clipper circuits&quot; which &quot;are connected to a counting circuit to synthesize the output signal of the counting circuit&quot; where the &quot;synthesized output signal becomes a desired rhythm.&quot;

Ace Tone commercialized its preset rhythm machine, called the FR-1 Rhythm Ace, in 1967. It offered 16 preset patterns, and four buttons to manually play each instrument sound (cymbal, claves, cowbell and bass drum). The rhythm patterns could also be cascaded together by pushing multiple rhythm buttons simultaneously, and the possible combination of rhythm patterns were more than a hundred (on the later models of Rhythm Ace, the individual volumes of each instrument could be adjusted with the small knobs or faders). The FR-1 was adopted by the Hammond Organ Company for incorporation within their latest organ models. In the US, the units were also marketed under the Multivox brand by Peter Sorkin Music Company, and in the UK, marketed under the Bentley Rhythm Ace brand.

=== Early preset drum machine users ===
A number of other preset drum machines were released in the 1970s, but early examples of the use can be found on The United States of America&#x27;s eponymous album from 1967–8. The first major pop song to use a drum machine was &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; by Robin Gibb, which reached #2 in Britain in 1969. Drum machine tracks were also heavily used on the Sly &amp; the Family Stone album &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot;, released in 1971. Sly &amp; the Family Stone was the first group to have a number #1 pop single that used a drum machine: that single was &quot;Family Affair&quot;.

The German krautrock band Can also used a drum machine on their songs &quot;Peking O&quot; and &quot;Spoon&quot;. The 1972 Timmy Thomas single &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Live Together&quot;/&quot;Funky Me&quot; featured a distinctive use of a drum machine and keyboard arrangement on both tracks. Another early example of electronic drums used by a rock band is &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; by Pink Floyd in 1972. The first album on which a drum machine produced all the percussion was Kingdom Come&#x27;s &quot;Journey&quot;, recorded in November 1972 using a Bentley Rhythm Ace. French singer-songwriter Léo Ferré mixed a drum machine with a symphonic orchestra in the song &quot;Je t&#x27;aimais bien, tu sais...&quot; in his album &quot;L&#x27;Espoir&quot;, released in 1974. Miles Davis&#x27; live band began to use a drum machine in 1974 (played by percussionist James Mtume), which can be heard on &quot;Dark Magus&quot; (1977). Osamu Kitajima&#x27;s progressive psychedelic rock album &quot;Benzaiten&quot; (1974) also used drum machines.

=== Programmable drum machines ===
In 1972, Eko released the ComputeRhythm, which was one of the first programmable drum machines. It had a 6-row push-button matrix that allowed the user to enter a pattern manually. The user could also push punch cards with pre-programmed rhythms through a reader slot on the unit.

Another stand-alone drum machine released in 1975, the PAiA Programmable Drum Set was also one of the first programmable drum machines, and was sold as a kit with parts and instructions which the buyer would use to build the machine.

In 1975, Ace Tone released the Rhythm Producer FR-15 that enables the modification of the pre-programmed rhythm patterns. In 1978, Roland released the Roland CR-78, the first microprocessor-based programmable rhythm machine, with four memory storage for user patterns. In 1979, a simpler version with four sounds, Boss DR-55, was released.

=== Drum sound synthesis ===
A key difference between such early machines and more modern equipment is that they use sound synthesis rather than digital sampling in order to generate their sounds. For example, a snare drum or maraca sound would typically be created using a burst of white noise whereas a bass drum sound would be made using sine waves or other basic waveforms. This meant that while the resulting sound was not very close to that of the real instrument, each model tended to have a unique character. For this reason, many of these early machines have achieved a certain &quot;cult status&quot; and are now sought after by producers for use in production of modern electronic music, most notably the Roland TR-808.

=== Digital sampling ===
The Linn LM-1 Drum Computer, released in 1980 at $4,995 (), was the first drum machine to use digital samples. It also featured rhythmic concepts such as swing factors, shuffle, accent, and real-time programming. Only about 500 were ever made, but its effect on the music industry was extensive. Its distinctive sound almost defines 1980s pop, and it can be heard on hundreds of hit records from the era, including The Human League&#x27;s &quot;Dare&quot;, Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Dance&quot;, Devo&#x27;s &quot;New Traditionalists&quot;, and Ric Ocasek&#x27;s &quot;Beatitude&quot;. Prince bought one of the first LM-1s and used it on nearly all of his most popular albums, including &quot;1999&quot; and &quot;Purple Rain&quot;.

Many of the drum sounds on the LM-1 were composed of two chips that were triggered at the same time, and each voice was individually tunable with individual outputs. Due to memory limitations, a crash cymbal sound was not available except as an expensive third-party modification. A cheaper version of the LM-1 was released in 1982 called the LinnDrum. Priced at $2,995 (), not all of its voices were tunable, but crash cymbal was included as a standard sound. Like its predecessor the LM-1, it featured swappable sound chips. The LinnDrum can be heard on records such as The Cars&#x27; &quot;Heartbeat City&quot; and Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s soundtrack for the film &quot;Scarface&quot;.

It was feared the LM-1 would put every session drummer in Los Angeles out of work and it caused many of L.A.&#x27;s top session drummers (Jeff Porcaro is one example) to purchase their own drum machines and learn to program them themselves in order to stay employed. Linn even marketed the LinnDrum specifically to drummers.

Following the success of the LM-1, Oberheim introduced the DMX, which also featured digitally sampled sounds and a &quot;swing&quot; feature similar to the one found on the Linn machines. It became very popular in its own right, becoming a staple of the nascent hip-hop scene.

Other manufacturers soon began to produce machines, e.g. the Sequential Circuits Drumtraks and Tom, the E-mu Drumulator and the Yamaha RX11.

In 1986, the SpecDrum by Cheetah Marketing, an inexpensive 8-bit sampling drum external module for the ZX Spectrum, was introduced, with a price less than £30, when similar models cost around £250.

=== Roland TR-808 and TR-909 ===

In 1980, the Roland Corporation launched the TR-808 Rhythm Composer. It was one of the earliest programmable drum machines, with which users could create their own rhythms rather than having to use preset patterns. Unlike the more expensive LM-1, the 808 is completely analog, meaning its sounds are generated non-digitally via hardware rather than samples (prerecorded sounds). Launched when electronic music had yet to become mainstream, the 808 received mixed reviews for its unrealistic drum sounds and was a commercial failure. Having built approximately 12,000 units, Roland discontinued the 808 after its semiconductors became impossible to restock.

Over the course of the 1980s, the 808 attracted a cult following among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market, ease of use, and idiosyncratic sounds, particularly its deep, &quot;booming&quot; bass drum. It became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic, dance, and hip hop genres, popularized by early hits such as Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; and Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot;. The 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine; its popularity with hip hop in particular has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music, comparable to the Fender Stratocaster&#x27;s influence on rock. Its sounds continue to be used as samples included with music software and modern drum machines.

The 808 was followed in 1983 by the TR-909, the first Roland drum machine to use MIDI, which synchronizes devices built by different manufacturers. It was also the first Roland drum machine to use samples for some sounds. Like the 808, the 909 was a commercial failure, but had a lasting influence on popular music after cheap units circulated on the used market; alongside the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, it influenced the development of electronic genres such as techno, house and acid.

=== Later machines ===

By 2000, standalone drum machines had become less common, partly supplanted by general-purpose hardware samplers controlled by sequencers (built-in or external), software-based sequencing and sampling and the use of loops, and music workstations with integrated sequencing and drum sounds. TR-808 and other digitized drum machine sounds can be found in archives on the Internet. However, traditional drum machines are still being made by companies such as Roland Corporation (under the name Boss), Zoom, Korg and Alesis, whose SR-16 drum machine has remained popular since it was introduced in 1991.

There are percussion-specific sound modules that can be triggered by pickups, trigger pads, or through MIDI. These are called drum modules; the Alesis D4 and Roland TD-8 are popular examples. Unless such a sound module also features a sequencer, it is, strictly speaking, not a drum machine.
In the 2010s a revival of interest in analogue synthesis resulted in a new wave of analogue drum machines, ranging from the budget-priced Korg Volca Beats and Akai Rhythm Wolf to the mid-priced Arturia DrumBrute, and the high-end MFB Tanzbär and Dave Smith Instruments Tempest. Roland&#x27;s TR-08 and TR-09 Rhythm Composers were digital recreations of the original TR-808 and 909, while Behringer released an analogue clone of the 808 as the Behringer RD-8 Rhythm Designer. Korg released an analog drum machine, the Volca Beats, in 2013.

==Programming==

Programming of drum machines varies from product to product. On most products, it can be done in real time: the user creates drum patterns by pressing the trigger pads as though a drum kit were being played; or using step-sequencing: the pattern is built up over time by adding individual sounds at certain points by placing them, as with the TR-808 and TR-909, along a 16-step bar. For example, a generic 4-on-the-floor dance pattern could be made by placing a closed high hat on the 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th steps, then a kick drum on the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th steps, and a clap or snare on the 5th and 13th. This pattern could be varied in a multitude of ways to obtain fills, breakdowns and other elements that the programmer sees fit, which in turn could be sequenced with song-sequence—essentially the drum machine plays back the programmed patterns from memory in an order the programmer has chosen. The machine will quantize entries that are slightly off-beat in order to make them exactly in time.

If the drum machine has MIDI connectivity, then one could program the drum machine with a computer or another MIDI device.

==Comparison with live drumming==
While drum machines have been used much in popular music since the 1980s, &quot;...scientific studies show there are certain aspects of human-created rhythm that machines cannot replicate, or can only replicate poorly&quot; such as the &quot;feel&quot; of human drumming and the ability of a human drummer to respond to changes in a song as it is being played live onstage. Human drummers also have the ability to make slight variations in their playing, such as playing &quot;ahead of the beat&quot; or &quot;behind the beat&quot; for sections of a song, in contrast to a drum machine that plays a pre-programmed rhythm. As well, human drummers play a &quot;tremendously wide variety of rhythmic variations&quot; that drum machines cannot reproduce.

===Labor costs===
Increasingly, drum machines and drum programming are used by major record labels to undercut the costly expense of studio drummers.

<text>The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex, hand-written in an unknown script referred to as Voynichese. The vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404–1438). Stylistic analysis has indicated the manuscript may have been composed in Italy during the Italian Renaissance. The origins, authorship, and purpose of the manuscript are still debated, but currently scholars lack the translation(s) and context needed to both properly entertain or eliminate any of the possibilities. Hypotheses range from a script for a natural language or constructed language, an unread code, cypher, or other form of cryptography, or perhaps a hoax, reference work (i.e. folkloric index or compendium), glossolalia or work of fiction (e.g. science fantasy or mythopoeia, metafiction, speculative fiction).

The first confirmed owner was Georg Baresch, a 17th-century alchemist from Prague. The manuscript is named after Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish book dealer who purchased it in 1912. The manuscript consists of around 240 pages, but there is evidence that pages are missing. The text is written from left to right, and some pages are foldable sheets of varying sizes. Most of the pages have fantastical illustrations and diagrams, some crudely coloured, with sections of the manuscript showing people, unidentified plants and astrological symbols. Since 1969, it has been held in Yale University&#x27;s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. In 2020, Yale University published the manuscript online in its entirety in their digital library.

The Voynich manuscript has been studied by both professional and amateur cryptographers, including American and British codebreakers from both World War I and World War II. Codebreakers Prescott Currier, William Friedman, Elizebeth Friedman, and John Tiltman were unsuccessful.

The manuscript has never been demonstrably deciphered, and none of the proposed hypotheses have been independently verified. The mystery of its meaning and origin has excited speculation and provoked study.

== Description ==
=== Codicology ===
The codicology, or physical characteristics of the manuscript, has been studied by researchers. The manuscript measures , with hundreds of vellum pages collected into 18 quires. The total number of pages is around 240, but the exact number depends on how the manuscript&#x27;s unusual foldouts are counted. The quires have been numbered from 1 to 20 in various locations, using a style of numerals consistent with those used in the 15th century, and the top righthand corner of each &quot;recto&quot; (righthand) page has been numbered from 1 to 116, using a style of numerals that originated at a later date. From the various numbering gaps in the quires and pages, it seems likely that in the past, the manuscript had at least 272 pages in 20 quires, some of which were already missing when Wilfrid Voynich acquired the manuscript in 1912. There is strong evidence that many of the book&#x27;s were reordered at various points in the book&#x27;s history, and that its pages were originally in a different order than the order they are in today.

=== Parchment, covers, and binding ===
Samples from various parts of the manuscript were radiocarbon dated at the University of Arizona in 2009. The results were consistent for all samples tested and indicated a date for the parchment between 1404 and 1438. Protein testing in 2014 revealed that the parchment was made from calfskin, and multispectral analysis showed that it had not been written on before the manuscript was created (i.e., it is not a palimpsest). The quality of the parchment is average and has deficiencies, such as holes and tears, common in parchment codices, but was also prepared with so much care that the skin side is largely indistinguishable from the flesh side. The parchment is prepared from &quot;at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins&quot;.

Some folios (such as 42 and 47) are thicker than the usual parchment.

The goat skin binding and covers are not original to the book, but date to its possession by the Collegio Romano. Insect holes are present on the first and last folios of the manuscript in the current order and suggest that a wooden cover was present before the later covers. Discolouring on the edges points to a tanned leather inside cover.

=== Ink ===
Many pages contain substantial drawings or charts which are coloured with paint. Based on modern analysis using polarized light microscopy (PLM), it has been determined that a quill pen and iron gall ink were used for the text and figure outlines. The ink of the drawings, text, and page and quire numbers have similar microscopic characteristics. In 2009, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed that the inks contained major amounts of carbon, iron, sulphur, potassium and calcium with trace amounts of copper and occasionally zinc. EDS did not show the presence of lead, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) identified potassium lead oxide, potassium hydrogen sulphate, and syngenite in one of the samples tested. The similarity between the drawing inks and text inks suggested a contemporaneous origin.

=== Paint ===
Coloured paint was applied (somewhat crudely) to the ink-outlined figures, possibly at a later date. The blue, white, red-brown, and green paints of the manuscript have been analysed using PLM, XRD, EDS, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

* The blue paint proved to be ground azurite with minor traces of the copper oxide cuprite.
* The white paint is likely a mixture of egg-white and calcium carbonate.
* The green paint is tentatively characterised by copper and copper-chlorine resinate; the crystalline material might be atacamite or some other copper-chlorine compound.
* Analysis of the red-brown paint indicated a red ochre with the crystal phases hematite and iron sulphide. Minor amounts of lead sulphide and palmierite are possibly present in the red-brown paint.

The pigments used were deemed inexpensive.

=== Retouching ===
Computer scientist Jorge Stolfi of the University of Campinas highlighted that parts of the text and drawings have been modified, using darker ink over a fainter, earlier script. Evidence for this is visible in various folios, for example &quot;f1r&quot;, &quot;f3v&quot;, &quot;f26v&quot;, &quot;f57v&quot;, &quot;f67r2&quot;, &quot;f71r&quot;, &quot;f72v1&quot;, &quot;f72v3&quot; and &quot;f73r&quot;.

=== Text ===
Every page in the manuscript contains text, mostly in an unidentified language, but some have extraneous writing in Latin script. The bulk of the text in the 240-page manuscript is written in an unknown script, running left to right. Most of the characters are composed of one or two simple pen strokes. There exists some dispute as to whether certain characters are distinct, but a script of 20–25 characters would account for virtually all of the text; the exceptions are a few dozen rarer characters that occur only once or twice each. There is no obvious punctuation.

Much of the text is written in a single column in the body of a page, with a slightly ragged right margin and paragraph divisions and sometimes with stars in the left margin. Other text occurs in charts or as labels associated with illustrations. The flows smoothly, giving the impression that the symbols were not enciphered; there is no delay between characters, as would normally be expected in written encoded text.

==== Extraneous writing ====
Only a few of the words in the manuscript are thought to have not been written in the unknown script:

* &quot;f1r&quot;: A sequence of Latin letters in the right margin parallel with characters from the unknown script, also the now-unreadable signature of &quot;Jacobj à Tepenecz&quot; is found in the bottom margin.
* &quot;f17r&quot;: A line of writing in the Latin script in the top margin.
* &quot;f66r&quot;: A small number of words in the bottom left corner near a drawing of a nude man have been read as , a High German phrase for &#x27;a widow&#x27;s share&#x27;.
* &quot;f70v–f73v&quot;: The astrological series of diagrams in the astronomical section has the names of ten of the months (from March to December) written in Latin script, with spelling suggestive of the medieval languages of France, northwest Italy, or the Iberian Peninsula.
* &quot;f116v&quot;: Four lines written in rather distorted Latin script, referred to as &quot;Michitonese&quot;, except for two words in the unknown script. The words in Latin script appear to be distorted with characteristics of the unknown language. The lettering resembles European alphabets of the late 14th and 15th centuries, but the words do not seem to make sense in any language. Whether these bits of Latin script were part of the original text or were added later is not known.
==== Transcription ====
Various transcription alphabets have been created to equate Voynich characters with Latin characters to help with cryptanalysis, such as the Extensible (originally: European) Voynich Alphabet (EVA). The first major one was created by the &quot;First Study Group&quot;, led by cryptographer William F. Friedman in the 1940s, where each line of the manuscript was transcribed to an IBM punch card to make it machine readable.

==== Statistical patterns ====
The text consists of over 170,000 characters, with spaces dividing the text into about 35,000 groups of varying length, usually referred to as &quot;words&quot; or &quot;word tokens&quot; (37,919); 8,114 of those words are considered unique &quot;word types&quot;. The structure of these words seems to follow phonological or orthographic laws of some sort; for example, certain characters must appear in each word (like English vowels), some characters never follow others, or some may be doubled or tripled, but others may not. The distribution of letters within words is also rather peculiar: Some characters occur only at the beginning of a word, some only at the end (like Greek ς), and some always in the middle section.

Many researchers have commented upon the highly regular structure of the words. Professor Gonzalo Rubio, an expert in ancient languages at Pennsylvania State University, stated:

Stephan Vonfelt studied statistical properties of the distribution of letters and their correlations (properties which can be vaguely characterised as rhythmic resonance, alliteration, or assonance) and found that under that respect Voynichese is more similar to the Mandarin Chinese text of the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; than to the text of works from European languages, although the numerical differences between Voynichese and Mandarin Chinese pinyin look larger than those between Mandarin Chinese pinyin and European languages.

Practically no words have fewer than two letters or more than ten. Some words occur in only certain sections, or in only a few pages; others occur throughout the manuscript. Few repetitions occur among the thousand or so labels attached to the illustrations. There are instances where the same common word appears up to five times in a row (see Zipf&#x27;s law). Words that differ by only one letter also repeat with unusual frequency, causing single-substitution alphabet decipherings to yield babble-like text. In 1962, cryptanalyst Elizebeth Friedman described such statistical analyses as &quot;doomed to utter frustration&quot;.

In 2014, a team led by Diego Amancio of the University of São Paulo published a study using statistical methods to analyse the relationships of the words in the text. Instead of trying to find the meaning, Amancio&#x27;s team looked for connections and clusters of words. By measuring the frequency and intermittence of words, Amancio claimed to identify the text&#x27;s keywords and produced three-dimensional models of the text&#x27;s structure and word frequencies. The team concluded that, in 90% of cases, the Voynich systems are similar to those of other known books, indicating that the text is in an actual language, not random gibberish.

Linguists Claire Bowern and Luke Lindemann have applied statistical methods to the Voynich manuscript, comparing it to other languages and encodings of languages, and have found both similarities and differences in statistical properties. Character sequences in languages are measured using a metric called h2, or second-order conditional entropy. Natural languages tend to have an h2 between 3 and 4, but Voynichese has much more predictable character sequences, and an h2 around 2. However, at higher levels of organisation, the Voynich manuscript displays properties similar to those of natural languages. Based on this, Bowern dismisses theories that the manuscript is gibberish. It is likely to be an encoded natural language or a constructed language. Bowern also concludes that the statistical properties of the Voynich manuscript are not consistent with the use of a substitution cipher or polyalphabetic cipher.

As noted in Bowern&#x27;s review, multiple scribes or &quot;hands&quot; may have written the manuscript, possibly using two methods of encoding at least one natural language. The &quot;language&quot; Voynich A appears in the herbal and pharmaceutical parts of the manuscript. The &quot;language&quot; known as Voynich B appears in the balneological section, some parts of the medicinal and herbal sections, and the astrological section. The most common vocabulary items of Voynich A and Voynich B are substantially different. Topic modeling of the manuscript suggests that pages identified as written by a particular scribe may relate to a different topic.

In terms of morphology, if visual spaces in the manuscript are assumed to indicate word breaks, there are consistent patterns that suggest a three-part word structure of prefix, root or midfix, and suffix. Certain characters and character combinations are more likely to appear in particular fields. There are minor variations between Voynich A and Voynich B. The predictability of certain letters in a relatively small number of combinations in certain parts of words appears to explain the low entropy (h2) of Voynichese. In the absence of obvious punctuation, some variants of the same word appear to be specific to typographical positions, such as the beginning of a paragraph, line, or sentence.

The Voynich word frequencies of both variants appear to conform to a Zipfian distribution, supporting the idea that the text has linguistic meaning. This has implications for the encoding methods most likely to have been used, since some forms of encoding interfere with the Zipfian distribution. Measures of the proportional frequency of the ten most common words is similar to those of the Semitic, Iranian, and Germanic languages. Another measure of morphological complexity, the Moving-Average Type–Token Ratio (MATTR) index, is similar to Iranian, Germanic, and Romance languages.

=== Illustrations ===

Because the text cannot be read, the manuscript is conventionally divided into sections based on its illustrations. Most of the manuscript forms six different sections, each typified by illustrations with different styles and supposed subject matter except for the last section, in which the only drawings are small stars in the margin. The conventional sections are:

* Herbal, 112 folios: Each page displays one or two plants and a few paragraphs of text, a format typical of European herbals of the time. Some parts of these drawings are larger and cleaner copies of sketches seen in the &quot;pharmaceutical&quot; section. None of the plants depicted are unambiguously identifiable.
* Astronomical, 21 folios: Contains circular diagrams suggestive of astronomy or astrology, some of them with suns, moons, and stars. One series of 12 diagrams depicts conventional symbols for the zodiacal constellations (two fish for Pisces, a bull for Taurus, a hunter with crossbow for Sagittarius, etc.). Each of these has 30 female figures arranged in two or more concentric bands. Most of the females are at least partly nude, and each holds what appears to be a labelled star or is shown with the star attached to either arm by what could be a tether or cord of some kind. The last two pages of this section were lost (Aquarius and Capricornus, roughly February and January), while Aries and Taurus are split into four paired diagrams with 15 women and 15 stars each. Some of these diagrams are on fold-out pages.
* Balneological, 20 folios: A dense, continuous text interspersed with drawings, mostly showing small nude women, some wearing crowns, bathing in pools or tubs connected by an elaborate network of pipes. The bifolio consists of folios 78 (verso) and 81 (recto); it forms an integrated design, with water flowing from one folio to the other.
* Cosmological, 13 folios: More circular diagrams, but they are of an obscure nature. This section also has foldouts; one of them spans six pages, commonly called the Rosettes folio, and contains a map or diagram with nine &quot;islands&quot; or &quot;rosettes&quot; connected by &quot;causeways&quot; and containing castles, as well as what might be a volcano.
* Pharmaceutical, 34 folios: Many labelled drawings of isolated plant parts (roots, leaves, etc.), objects resembling apothecary jars, ranging in style from the mundane to the fantastical, and a few text paragraphs.
* Recipes, 22 folios: Full pages of text broken into many short paragraphs, each marked with a star in the left margin.

Five folios contain only text, and at least 14 folios (28 pages) are missing from the manuscript.

=== Purpose ===

The overall impression given by the surviving leaves of the manuscript is that it was meant to serve as a pharmacopoeia or to address topics in medieval or early modern medicine. However, the puzzling details of the illustrations have fuelled many theories about the book&#x27;s origin, the contents of its text, and the purpose for which it was intended.

The first section of the book is almost certainly herbal, but attempts have failed to identify the plants, either with actual specimens or with the stylised drawings of contemporaneous herbals. Only a few of the plant drawings can be identified with reasonable certainty, such as a wild pansy and the maidenhair fern. The herbal pictures that match pharmacological sketches appear to be clean copies of them, except that missing parts were completed with improbable details. In fact, many of the plant drawings in the herbal section seem to be composite: the roots of one species have been fastened to the leaves of another, with flowers from a third.

Astrological considerations frequently played a prominent role in herb gathering, bloodletting, and other medical procedures common during the likeliest dates of the manuscript. However, interpretation remains speculative, apart from the obvious Zodiac symbols and one diagram possibly showing the classical planets.

== History ==

Much of the book&#x27;s early provenance is unknown, though the text and illustrations are all characteristically European. In 2009, University of Arizona researchers radiocarbon dated the manuscript&#x27;s vellum to between 1404 and 1438. In addition, McCrone Associates in Westmont, Illinois, found that the paints in the manuscript were of materials to be expected from that period of European history. There have been erroneous reports that McCrone Associates indicated that much of the ink was added not long after the creation of the parchment, but their official report contains no such statement.

The first confirmed owner was Georg Baresch, a 17th-century alchemist from Prague. Baresch was apparently puzzled about this &quot;Sphynx&quot; that had been &quot;taking up space uselessly in his library&quot; for many years. He learned that Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher from the Collegio Romano had published a Coptic (Egyptian) dictionary and claimed to have deciphered the Egyptian hieroglyphs; Baresch twice sent a sample copy of the script to Kircher in Rome, asking for clues. The 1639 letter from Baresch to Kircher is the earliest known mention of the manuscript to have been confirmed.

Whether Kircher answered the request or not is not known, but he was apparently interested enough to try to acquire the book, which Baresch refused to yield. Upon Baresch&#x27;s death, the manuscript passed to his friend Jan Marek Marci (also known as Johannes Marcus Marci), then rector of Charles University in Prague. A few years later, Marci sent the book to Kircher, his longtime friend and correspondent.

Marci also sent Kircher a cover letter (in Latin, dated 19 August 1665 or 1666) that was still attached to the book when Voynich acquired it:

The &quot;Dr. Raphael&quot; is believed to be Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky, and the sum of 600 ducats is of actual gold weight. The only matching transaction in Rudolf&#x27;s records is the 1599 purchase of &quot;a couple of remarkable/rare books&quot; from Carl Widemann for the sum of 600 florins. Widemann was a prolific collector of esoteric and alchemical manuscripts, so his ownership of the manuscript is plausible, but unproven.

While Wilfrid Voynich took Raphael&#x27;s claims at face value, the Bacon authorship theory has been largely discredited. However, a piece of evidence supporting Rudolf&#x27;s ownership is the now almost invisible name or signature, on the first page of the book, of Jacobus Horcicky de Tepenecz, the head of Rudolf&#x27;s botanical gardens in Prague. Rudolf died still owing money to de Tepenecz, and it is possible that de Tepenecz may have been given the book (or simply taken it) in partial payment of that debt.
No records of the book for the next 200 years have been found, but in all likelihood, it was stored with the rest of Kircher&#x27;s correspondence in the library of the Collegio Romano (now the Pontifical Gregorian University). It probably remained there until the troops of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy captured the city in 1870 and annexed the Papal States. The new Italian government decided to confiscate many properties of the Church, including the library of the Collegio. Many books of the university&#x27;s library were hastily transferred to the personal libraries of its faculty just before this happened, according to investigations by Xavier Ceccaldi and others, and those books were exempt from confiscation. Kircher&#x27;s correspondence was among those books, and so, apparently, was the Voynich manuscript, as it still bears the &quot;ex libris&quot; of Petrus Beckx, head of the Jesuit order and the university&#x27;s rector at the time.

Beckx&#x27;s private library was moved to the Villa Mondragone, Frascati, a large country palace near Rome that had been bought by the Society of Jesus in 1866 and housed the headquarters of the Jesuits&#x27; Ghislieri College.

In 1903, the Society of Jesus (Collegio Romano) was short of money and decided to sell some of its holdings discreetly to the Vatican Library. The sale took place in 1912, but not all of the manuscripts listed for sale ended up going to the Vatican. Wilfrid Voynich acquired 30 of these manuscripts, among them the one which now bears his name. He spent the next seven years attempting to interest scholars in deciphering the script, while he worked to determine the origins of the manuscript.

In 1930, the manuscript was inherited after Wilfrid&#x27;s death by his widow Ethel Voynich, author of the novel &quot;The Gadfly&quot; and daughter of mathematician George Boole. She died in 1960 and left the manuscript to her close friend Anne Nill. In 1961, Nill sold the book to antique book dealer Hans P. Kraus. Kraus was unable to find a buyer and donated the manuscript to Yale University in 1969, where it was catalogued as &quot;MS 408&quot;, sometimes also referred to as &quot;Beinecke MS 408&quot;.

=== Timeline of ownership ===
The timeline of ownership of the Voynich manuscript is given below. The time when it was possibly created is shown in green (early 1400s), based on carbon dating of the vellum. Periods of unknown ownership are indicated in white. The commonly accepted owners of the 17th century are shown in orange; the long period of storage in the Collegio Romano is yellow. The location where Wilfrid Voynich allegedly acquired the manuscript (Frascati) is shown in green (late 1800s); Voynich&#x27;s ownership is shown in red, and modern owners are highlighted blue.
== Authorship hypotheses ==
Many people have been proposed as possible authors of the Voynich manuscript, among them Roger Bacon, John Dee or Edward Kelley, Giovanni Fontana, and Voynich.

=== Early history ===

Marci&#x27;s 1665/1666 cover letter to Kircher says that, according to his friend the late Raphael Mnishovsky, the book had once been bought by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia for 600 ducats, of actual gold weight. (Mnishovsky had died in 1644, more than 20 years earlier, and the deal must have occurred before Rudolf&#x27;s abdication in 1611, at least 55 years before Marci&#x27;s letter. However, Karl Widemann sold books to Rudolf II in March 1599.)
According to the letter, Mnishovsky (but not necessarily Rudolf) speculated that the author was 13th-century Franciscan friar and polymath Roger Bacon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bacon/Mnishovsky&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Marci said that he was suspending judgment about this claim, but it was taken quite seriously by Wilfrid Voynich, who did his best to confirm it. Voynich contemplated the possibility that the author was Albertus Magnus if not Roger Bacon.
The assumption that Bacon was the author led Voynich to conclude that John Dee sold the manuscript to Rudolf. Dee was a mathematician and astrologer at the court of Queen Elizabeth I of England who was known to have owned a large collection of Bacon&#x27;s manuscripts.

Dee and his &quot;scryer&quot; (spirit medium) Edward Kelley lived in Bohemia for several years, where they had hoped to sell their services to the emperor. However, this sale seems quite unlikely, according to John Schuster, because Dee&#x27;s meticulously kept diaries do not mention it.
If Bacon did not create the Voynich manuscript, a supposed connection to Dee is much weakened. It was thought possible, prior to the carbon dating of the manuscript, that Dee or Kelley might have written it and spread the rumour that it was originally a work of Bacon&#x27;s in the hopes of later selling it.

=== Fabrication by Voynich ===
Some suspect Voynich of having fabricated the manuscript himself. As an antique book dealer, he probably had the necessary knowledge and means, and a lost book by Roger Bacon would have been worth a fortune. Furthermore, Baresch&#x27;s letter and Marci&#x27;s letter only establish the existence of a manuscript, not that the Voynich manuscript is the same one mentioned. These letters could possibly have been the motivation for Voynich to fabricate the manuscript, assuming that he was aware of them. However, many consider the expert internal dating of the manuscript and the June 1999 discovery of Baresch&#x27;s letter to Kircher as having eliminated this possibility.

Eamon Duffy says that the radiocarbon dating of the parchment (or, more accurately, vellum) &quot;effectively rules out any possibility that the manuscript is a post-medieval forgery&quot;, as the consistency of the pages indicates origin from a single source, and &quot;it is inconceivable&quot; that a quantity of unused parchment comprising &quot;at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins&quot; could have survived from the early 15th century.

=== Giovanni Fontana ===

It has been suggested that some illustrations in the books of an Italian engineer, Giovanni Fontana, slightly resemble Voynich illustrations. Fontana was familiar with cryptography and used it in his books, although he did not use the Voynich script but a simple substitution cipher. In the book &quot;Secretum de thesauro experimentorum ymaginationis hominum&quot; (Secret of the treasure-room of experiments in man&#x27;s imagination), written c. 1430, Fontana described mnemonic machines, written in his cypher. That book and his &quot;Bellicorum instrumentorum liber&quot; both used a cryptographic system, described as a simple, rational cipher, based on signs without letters or numbers.

=== Other theories ===
Sometime before 1921, Voynich was able to read a name faintly written at the foot of the manuscript&#x27;s first page: &quot;Jacobj à Tepenecz&quot;. This is taken to be a reference to Jakub Hořčický of Tepenec, also known by his Latin name Jacobus Sinapius. Rudolf II had ennobled him in 1607, had appointed him his Imperial Distiller, and had made him curator of his botanical gardens as well as one of his personal physicians. Voynich (and many other people after him) concluded that Jacobus owned the Voynich manuscript prior to Baresch, and he drew a link from that to Rudolf&#x27;s court, in confirmation of Mnishovsky&#x27;s story.

Jacobus&#x27;s name has faded further since Voynich saw it, but is still legible under ultraviolet light. It does not match the copy of his signature in a document located by Jan Hurych in 2003. As a result, it has been suggested that the signature was added later, possibly even fraudulently by Voynich himself. 
Baresch&#x27;s letter bears some resemblance to a hoax that orientalist once played on Athanasius Kircher. Müller sent some unintelligible text to Kircher with a note explaining that it had come from Egypt, and asking him for a translation. Kircher reportedly solved it. It has been speculated that these were both cryptographic tricks played on Kircher to make him look foolish. 

Raphael Mnishovsky, the friend of Marci who was the reputed source of the Bacon story, was himself a cryptographer and apparently invented a cipher which he claimed was uncrackable (c. 1618). This has led to the speculation that Mnishovsky might have produced the Voynich manuscript as a practical demonstration of his cipher and made Baresch his unwitting test subject. Indeed, the disclaimer in the Voynich manuscript cover letter could mean that Marci suspected some kind of deception.

In his 2006 book, Nick Pelling proposed that the Voynich manuscript was written by 15th-century North Italian architect Antonio Averlino (also known as &quot;Filarete&quot;), a theory broadly consistent with the radiocarbon dating.

Jules Janick and Arthur O. Tucker, based on plant and animal identification, and the kabbalah map of central Mexico (folio 86v), argued that it was composed in Mexico between 1562 and 1572.

== Language hypotheses ==

Many hypotheses have been developed about the Voynich manuscript&#x27;s &quot;language&quot;, called &quot;Voynichese&quot;:

=== Ciphers ===
According to the &quot;letter-based cipher&quot; theory, the Voynich manuscript contains a meaningful text in some European language that was intentionally rendered obscure by mapping it to the Voynich manuscript &quot;alphabet&quot; through a cipher of some sort—an algorithm that operated on individual letters. This was the working hypothesis for most 20th-century deciphering attempts, including an informal team of NSA cryptographers led by William F. Friedman in the early 1950s.
The counterargument is that almost all cipher systems consistent with that era fail to match what is seen in the Voynich manuscript. For example, simple substitution ciphers would be excluded because the distribution of letter frequencies does not resemble that of any known language, while the small number of different letter shapes used implies that nomenclator and homophonic ciphers should be ruled out, because these typically employ larger cipher alphabets. Polyalphabetic ciphers were invented by Alberti in the 1460s and included the later Vigenère cipher, but they usually yield ciphertexts where all cipher shapes occur with roughly equal probability, quite unlike the language-like letter distribution which the Voynich manuscript appears to have.

However, the presence of many tightly grouped shapes in the Voynich manuscript (such as &quot;or&quot;, &quot;ar&quot;, &quot;ol&quot;, &quot;al&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;ain&quot;, &quot;aiin&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, &quot;aiir&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, &quot;ee&quot;, &quot;eee&quot;, among others) does suggest that its cipher system may make use of a &quot;verbose cipher&quot;, where single letters in a plaintext get enciphered into groups of fake letters. For example, the first two lines of page &quot;f15v&quot; contain &quot; and &quot;, which strongly resemble how Roman numerals such as &quot;CCC&quot; or &quot;XXXX&quot; would look if verbosely enciphered.

=== Shorthand ===
In 1943, Joseph Martin Feely suggested that the manuscript might be a scientific diary, written in a private shorthand system, using abbreviations, for a language such as Latin. However, according to Mary D&#x27;Imperio, &quot;other scholars ... unanimously rejected&quot; Feely&#x27;s proposed readings of the text and the hypothesis that the text was composed using a &quot;system of abbreviated forms&quot; was &quot;not considered acceptable&quot;.

=== Steganography ===
This theory holds that the text of the Voynich manuscript is mostly meaningless, but contains meaningful information hidden in inconspicuous details—e.g., the second letter of every word, or the number of letters in each line. This technique, called steganography, is very old and was described by Johannes Trithemius in 1499. Though the plain text was speculated to have been extracted by a Cardan grille (an overlay with cut-outs for the meaningful text) of some sort, this seems somewhat unlikely because the words and letters are not arranged on anything like a regular grid. Still, steganographic claims are hard to prove or disprove, because stegotexts can be arbitrarily hard to find.

It has been suggested that the meaningful text could be encoded in the length or shape of certain pen strokes.

=== Natural language ===
Statistical analysis of the text reveals patterns similar to those of natural languages. For instance, the word entropy (about 10 bits per word) is similar to that of English or Latin texts.
Amancio &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) argued that the Voynich manuscript &quot;is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with random texts&quot;.

The linguist Jacques Guy once suggested that the Voynich manuscript text could be some little-known natural language, written plaintext with an invented alphabet. He suggested Chinese in jest, but later comparison of word length statistics with Vietnamese and Chinese made him view that hypothesis seriously.
In many language families of East and Central Asia, mainly Sino-Tibetan (Chinese, Tibetan, and Burmese), Austroasiatic (Vietnamese, Khmer, etc.) and possibly Tai (Thai, Lao, etc.), morphemes generally have only one syllable.

Child (1976), a linguist of Indo-European languages for the U.S. National Security Agency, proposed that the manuscript was written in a &quot;hitherto unknown North Germanic dialect&quot;.
He identified in the manuscript a &quot;skeletal syntax several elements of which are reminiscent of certain Germanic languages&quot;, while the content is expressed using &quot;a great deal of obscurity&quot;.

In January 2014, Professor Stephen Bax of the University of Bedfordshire made public his research into using &quot;bottom up&quot; methodology to understand the manuscript. His method involved looking for and translating proper nouns, in association with relevant illustrations, in the context of other languages of the same time period. A paper he posted online offers tentative translation of 14 characters and 10 words.
He suggested the text is a treatise on nature written in a natural language, rather than a code, but no further work has been done since Bax&#x27;s death in 2017.

Deep learning has been proposed as a computing method for analysing language families to which the manuscript&#x27;s alphabet could be related. In 2023, researchers used deep learning algorithms to demonstrate that, out of a representative sample of seven ancient Indian scripts, the strongest resemblance was to Khojki.

Tucker &amp; Talbert (2014) published a paper claiming a positive identification of 37 plants, 6 animals, and one mineral referenced in the manuscript to plant drawings in the &quot;Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis&quot; or Badianus manuscript, an Aztec herbal written in 1552.
Together with the presence of atacamite in the paint, they argue that the plants were from colonial New Spain and the text represented Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. They date the manuscript to between 1521 (the date of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire) and &quot;circa&quot; 1576. These dates contradict the earlier radiocarbon date of the vellum and other elements of the manuscript. However, they argued that the vellum could have been stored and used at a later date. The analysis has been criticised by other Voynich manuscript researchers,
who argued that a skilled forger could construct plants that coincidentally have a passing resemblance to theretofore undiscovered existing plants.
Nahuatl specialist M.P. Hansen has rejected their proposed readings as pure nonsense.

=== Constructed language ===

The peculiar internal structure of Voynich manuscript words led William F. Friedman to conjecture that the text could be a constructed language. In 1950, Friedman asked the British army officer John Tiltman to analyse a few pages of the text, but Tiltman did not share this conclusion. In a paper in 1967, Brigadier Tiltman said:
The concept of a constructed language is quite old, as attested by John Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Language&quot; (1668), but still postdates the generally accepted origin of the Voynich manuscript by two centuries. In most known examples, categories are subdivided by adding suffixes (fusional languages); as a consequence, a text in a particular subject would have many words with similar prefixes—for example, all plant names would begin with similar letters, and likewise for all diseases, etc. This feature could then explain the repetitive nature of the Voynich text. However, no one has been able yet to assign a plausible meaning to any prefix or suffix in the Voynich manuscript.

=== Hoax ===

The fact that the manuscript has defied decipherment thus far has led various scholars to propose that the text does not contain meaningful content in the first place, implying that it may be a medieval hoax.

In 2003, computer scientist Gordon Rugg showed that text with characteristics similar to the Voynich manuscript could have been produced using a table of word prefixes, stems, and suffixes, which would have been selected and combined by means of a perforated paper overlay. The latter device, known as a Cardan grille, was invented around 1550 as an encryption tool, more than 100 years after the estimated creation date of the Voynich manuscript. Some maintain that the similarity between the pseudo-texts generated in Gordon Rugg&#x27;s experiments and the Voynich manuscript is superficial, and the grille method could be used to emulate any language to a certain degree.

In April 2007, a study by Austrian researcher Andreas Schinner published in &quot;Cryptologia&quot; supported the hoax hypothesis. Schinner posited that the statistical properties of the manuscript&#x27;s text were more consistent with meaningless gibberish produced using a quasi-stochastic method, such as the one described by Rugg, than with Latin and medieval German texts.

Some scholars have claimed that the manuscript&#x27;s text appears too sophisticated to be a hoax. In 2013, Marcelo Montemurro, a theoretical physicist from the University of Manchester, published findings claiming that semantic networks exist in the text of the manuscript, such as content-bearing words occurring in a clustered pattern, or new words being used when there was a shift in topic. With this evidence, he believes it unlikely that these features were intentionally &quot;incorporated&quot; into the text to make a hoax more realistic, as most of the required academic knowledge of these structures did not exist at the time the Voynich manuscript would have been written. In 2021, researchers at Yale University, using the tf–idf analysis, further investigated the relation between clusters of subjects in the text and topics as they could be identified by illustrations and paleography analysis. Their conclusion is that clusters derived by computation match with the topics of the illustrations to some degree, thus providing evidence that the Voynich manuscript contains meaningful text.

However, other scholars have argued that such sophisticated patterns could also appear in hoaxed documents. In 2016, Gordon Rugg and Gavin Taylor published another article in &quot;Cryptologia&quot; demonstrating that the grille method could reproduce many larger-scale features of the text. In 2019, Torsten Timm and Andreas Schinner published a paper arguing that the text was produced by a process of &quot;self-citation&quot; in which scribes copied and modified meaningless words from earlier in the text. Using a computer simulation of this process, they demonstrated that it could reproduce many of the statistical characteristics of the Voynich manuscript. In 2022, Yale University researchers Daniel Gaskell and Claire Bowern published the results of an experiment in which human participants intentionally tried to write meaningless text. They found that the resulting text was often highly non-random and exhibited many of the same unusual statistical properties as the Voynich manuscript, supporting the idea that some features of the text could have been produced in a hoax.

=== Glossolalia ===
In their 2004 book, Gerry Kennedy and Rob Churchill suggest the possibility that the Voynich manuscript may be a case of glossolalia (speaking-in-tongues), channelling, or outsider art. If so, the author felt compelled to write large amounts of text in a manner which resembles stream of consciousness, either because of voices heard or because of an urge. This often takes place in an invented language in glossolalia, usually made up of fragments of the author&#x27;s own language, although invented scripts for this purpose are rare.

Kennedy and Churchill use Hildegard von Bingen&#x27;s works to point out similarities between the Voynich manuscript and the illustrations that she drew when she was suffering from severe bouts of migraine, which can induce a trance-like state prone to glossolalia. Prominent features found in both are abundant &quot;streams of stars&quot;, and the repetitive nature of the &quot;nymphs&quot; in the balneological section.

The theory is controversial, and it is virtually impossible to prove or disprove it, short of deciphering the text. Kennedy and Churchill are themselves not convinced of the hypothesis, but consider it plausible. In the culminating chapter of their work, Kennedy states his belief that it is a hoax or forgery. Churchill acknowledges the possibility that the manuscript is either a synthetic forgotten language (as advanced by Friedman), or else a forgery, as the preeminent theory. However, he concludes that, if the manuscript is a genuine creation, mental illness or delusion seems to have affected the author.

== Decipherment claims ==
Since the manuscript&#x27;s modern rediscovery in 1912, there have been a number of claimed decipherings.

=== William Romaine Newbold ===
One of the earliest efforts to decode the book&#x27;s code was made in 1921 by William Romaine Newbold from the University of Pennsylvania. His singular hypothesis held that the visible text is meaningless, but that each apparent &quot;letter&quot; is in fact constructed of a series of tiny markings discernible only under magnification. These markings were supposed to be based on ancient Greek shorthand, forming a second level of script that held the real content of the writing. Newbold claimed to have used this knowledge to work out entire paragraphs proving the authorship of Bacon and recording his use of a compound microscope four hundred years before van Leeuwenhoek. A circular drawing in the astronomical section depicts an irregularly shaped object with four curved arms, which Newbold interpreted as a picture of a galaxy, which could be obtained only with a telescope.

Newbold&#x27;s analysis has since been dismissed as overly speculative after John Matthews Manly of the University of Chicago pointed out serious flaws in his theory. For example, each shorthand character was assumed to have multiple interpretations, and as a result there was no reliable way to determine which was intended for any given case. Newbold&#x27;s method also required rearranging letters at will until intelligible Latin was produced. These factors alone ensure the system enough flexibility that nearly anything at all could be discerned from the microscopic markings. Although evidence of micrography using the Hebrew language can be traced as far back as the ninth century, it is nowhere near as compact or complex as the shapes Newbold made out. Close study of the manuscript revealed the markings to be artefacts caused by the way ink cracks as it dries on rough vellum. Perceiving significance in these artefacts can be attributed to pareidolia. Thanks to Manly&#x27;s thorough refutation, the micrography theory is now generally disregarded.

=== Joseph Martin Feely ===
In 1943, Joseph Martin Feely published &quot;Roger Bacon&#x27;s Cipher: The Right Key Found&quot;, in which he claimed that the book was a scientific diary written by Roger Bacon. Feely&#x27;s method posited that the text was a highly abbreviated medieval Latin written in a simple substitution cipher.

=== Leonell C. Strong ===
Leonell C. Strong, a cancer research scientist and amateur cryptographer, claimed that the solution to the Voynich manuscript was a &quot;peculiar double system of arithmetical progressions of a multiple alphabet&quot;. Strong published a translation of two pages in 1947, and claimed that the plaintext revealed the Voynich manuscript to be written by the 16th-century English author Anthony Ascham, whose works include &quot;A Little Herbal&quot;, published in 1550. Notes released after his death reveal that the last stages of his analysis, in which he selected words to combine into phrases, were questionably subjective.

=== Robert S. Brumbaugh ===
In 1978, Robert Brumbaugh, a professor of classical and medieval philosophy at Yale University, claimed that the manuscript was a forgery intended to fool Emperor Rudolf II into purchasing it, and that the text is Latin enciphered with a complex, two-step method.

=== John Stojko ===
In 1978, John Stojko published &quot;Letters to God&#x27;s Eye&quot;, in which he claimed that the Voynich Manuscript was a series of letters written in vowelless Ukrainian. The theory caused some sensation among the Ukrainian diaspora at the time, and then in independent Ukraine after 1991. However, the date Stojko gives for the letters, the lack of relation between the text and the images, and the general looseness in the method of decryption have all been criticised.

=== Stephen Bax ===
In January 2014, applied linguistics Professor Stephen Bax self-published a paper proposing a &quot;provisional, partial decoding&quot; of the Voynich Manuscript, proposing a translation for ten proper nouns and fourteen letters from the manuscript using techniques similar to those used to successfully translate Egyptian hieroglyphs. He claimed the manuscript to be a treatise on nature, in a Near Eastern or Asian language, but no full translation was made before Bax&#x27;s death in November 2017.

=== Greg Kondrak ===
Greg Kondrak, a professor of natural language processing at the University of Alberta, and his graduate student Bradley Hauer used computational linguistics in an attempt to decode the manuscript. Their findings were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in August 2017 in the form of an article suggesting that the manuscript&#x27;s language is most likely Hebrew, but encoded using alphagrams, i.e. alphabetically ordered anagrams. However, the team admitted that experts in medieval manuscripts who reviewed the work were not convinced.

=== Nicholas Gibbs ===
In September 2017, television writer Nicholas Gibbs claimed to have decoded the manuscript as idiosyncratically abbreviated Latin. He declared the manuscript to be a mostly plagiarised guide to women&#x27;s health. Scholars would go on to criticise Gibbs for patching together already-existing scholarship with a highly speculative and incorrect translation; Lisa Fagin Davis, director of the Medieval Academy of America, stated that Gibbs&#x27; decipherment &quot;doesn&#x27;t result in Latin that makes sense.&quot; Davis added that she was &quot;surprised the TLS published it.&quot; Other researchers concurred.

=== Ahmet Ardıç ===
In February 2018, Ahmet Ardıç, a Turkish Canadian electrical engineer with an interest in Turkic linguistics, claimed that the manuscript is written in a language variety derived from Old Turkic. The text was written using &quot;phonemic orthography&quot;, meaning the manuscript&#x27;s author spelled out words as they were heard phonetically. Ardıç began deciphering the manuscript four years earlier with the help of his two sons. &quot;Ahmet noticed that the words in the book appeared to be built of repetitive roots with prefixes and suffixes added. It reminded him of his native Turkish [...] At first he found seven characters that were the same as Old Turkic, and slowly the language revealed itself [...] Other illustrations allowed them to match up Old Turkic words with the images pictured&quot;, reported The Canadian Press. Ardıç&#x27;s team claimed to have deciphered and translated at least &quot;and is confident there is now sufficient vocabulary to read at least 30% of the manuscript.&quot; His submission to the journal &quot;Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures&quot; was rejected in 2019.

=== Gerard Cheshire ===
In May 2019, Gerard Cheshire, a biology research assistant at the University of Bristol, claimed that the manuscript is written in a &quot;calligraphic proto-Romance&quot; language. He claimed to have deciphered the manuscript in two weeks using a combination of &quot;lateral thinking and ingenuity.&quot; Cheshire has suggested that the manuscript is &quot;a compendium of information on herbal remedies, therapeutic bathing, and astrological readings&quot;; that it contains numerous descriptions of medicinal plants and passages that focus on female physical and mental health, reproduction, and parenting; and that the manuscript is the only known text written in proto-Romance. He further claimed: &quot;The manuscript was compiled by Dominican nuns as a source of reference for Maria of Castile, Queen of Aragon.&quot;

In June 2023, Cheshire published his translation of the foldout illustration on page 158.
He claims that it depicts a volcano, and theorises that it places the manuscript&#x27;s creators near the island of Vulcano which was an active volcano during the 15th century. However, experts in medieval documents disputed this interpretation vigorously. Approached for comment, Lisa Fagin Davis gave this explanation:

The University of Bristol subsequently removed a reference to Cheshire&#x27;s claims from its website, referring, in a statement, to concerns about the validity of the research and stating: &quot;This research was entirely the author&#x27;s own work and is not affiliated with the University of Bristol, the School of Arts nor the Centre for Medieval Studies&quot;.

== Facsimiles ==
Many books and articles have been written about the manuscript. Copies of the manuscript pages were made by alchemist Georg Baresch in 1637 and sent to Athanasius Kircher, and later by Wilfrid Voynich.

In 2004, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library made high-resolution digital scans publicly available online, and several printed facsimiles appeared. In 2016, the Beinecke Library and Yale University Press co-published a facsimile, &quot;The Voynich Manuscript&quot;, with scholarly essays.

The Beinecke Library also authorised the production of a print run of 898 replicas by the Spanish publisher Siloé in 2017.

In September 2024, multispectral scans of ten selected pages were made public, revealing details unseen with visible light.

== Cultural influence ==

The manuscript has inspired various works of fiction, including:
*Between 1976 and 1978, Italian artist Luigi Serafini created the &quot;Codex Seraphinianus&quot; containing false writing and pictures of imaginary plants in a style reminiscent of the Voynich manuscript.
*Contemporary classical composer Hanspeter Kyburz&#x27;s 1995 chamber work &quot;The Voynich Cipher Manuscript, for chorus &amp; ensemble&quot; is inspired by the manuscript.
*In 2015, the New Haven Symphony Orchestra commissioned Hannah Lash to compose a symphony inspired by the manuscript.
*For the 500th strip of the webcomic &quot;Sandra and Woo&quot;, published 29 July 2013, writer Oliver Knörzer and artist Puri Andini created &quot;The Book of Woo&quot;, four illustrated pages inspired by the Voynich manuscript. All four pages show strange illustrations next to a cipher text. The strip was mentioned in MTV Geek and discussed in the &quot;Cipher Mysteries&quot; blog of cryptology expert Nick Pelling as well as &quot;Klausis Krypto Kolumne&quot; of cryptology expert . &quot;The Book of Woo&quot; was also discussed in the 2017 book &quot;Unsolved!&quot; by , about the history of famous ciphers. As part of the lead-up to the 1,000th strip, Knörzer posted the translated English text on 28 June 2018, revealing the crucial obfuscation involved translating the plain text into the constructed language Toki Pona.

<text>Ferrara (; ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy, capital of the province of Ferrara. it had 132,009 inhabitants. It is situated northeast of Bologna, on the Po di Volano, a branch channel of the main stream of the Po River, located north. The town has broad streets and numerous palaces dating from the Renaissance, when it hosted the court of the House of Este. For its beauty and cultural importance, it has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

==History==
===Antiquity and Middle Ages===
The first documented settlements in the area of the present-day Province of Ferrara date from the 6th century BC. The ruins of the Etruscan town of Spina, established along the lagoons at the ancient mouth of Po river, were lost until modern times, when drainage schemes in the Valli di Comacchio marshes in 1922 first officially revealed a necropolis with over 4,000 tombs, evidence of a population centre that in Antiquity must have played a major role.

There is uncertainty among scholars about the proposed Roman origin of the settlement in its current location (Tacitus and Boccaccio refer to a &quot;Forum Alieni&quot;), for little is known of this period, but some archeologic evidence points to the hypothesis that Ferrara could have been originated from two small Byzantine settlements: a cluster of facilities around the Cathedral of St. George, on the right bank of the main branch of the Po, which then ran much closer to the city than today, and a castrum, a fortified complex built on the left bank of the river to defend against the Lombards.

Ferrara appears first in a document of the Lombard king Desiderius of 753 AD, when he captured the town from the Exarchate of Ravenna. Later the Franks, after routing the Lombards, presented Ferrara to the Papacy in 754 or 756. In 988 Ferrara was ceded by the Church to the House of Canossa, but at the death of Matilda of Tuscany in 1115 it became a free commune. During the 12th century the history of the town was marked by the wrestling for power between two preeminent families, the Guelph Adelardi and the Ghibelline Salinguerra. The powerful Imperial House of Este threw their decisive weight behind the Salinguerra and eventually reaped the benefits of victory for themselves. Thus, in 1264 Obizzo II d&#x27;Este was proclaimed lifelong ruler of Ferrara, taking the additional titles of Lord of Modena in 1288 and of Reggio in 1289. His rule marked the end of the communal period in Ferrara and the beginning of the Este rule, which lasted until 1598.

===Early modern===


In 1452 Borso d&#x27;Este was created duke of Modena and Reggio by Emperor Frederick III and in 1471 duke of Ferrara by Pope Paul II. Lionello and, especially, Ercole I were among the most important patrons of the arts in late 15th- and early 16th-century Italy. During this time, Ferrara grew into an international cultural centre, renowned for its architecture, music, literature and visual arts.

The architecture of Ferrara greatly benefited from the genius of Biagio Rossetti, who was requested in 1484 by Ercole I to draft a masterplan for the expansion of the town. The resulting &quot;Erculean Addition&quot; is considered one of the most important examples of Renaissance urban planning and contributed to the selection of Ferrara as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In spite of having entered its golden age, Ferrara was severely hit by a war against Venice fought and lost in 1482–84. Alfonso I succeeded to the throne in 1505 and married the notorious Lucrezia Borgia. He again fought Venice in the Italian Wars after joining the League of Cambrai. In 1509 he was excommunicated by Pope Julius II, but was able to overcome the Papal and Spanish armies in 1512 at the Battle of Ravenna. These successes were based on Ferrara&#x27;s artillery, produced in his own foundry which was the best of its time.

Upon his death in 1534, Alfonso I was succeeded by his son Ercole II, whose marriage in 1528 to the second daughter of Louis XII, Renée of France, brought great prestige to the court of Ferrara. Under his reign, the Duchy remained an affluent country and a cultural powerhouse. However, an earthquake struck the town in 1570, causing the economy to collapse, and when Ercole II&#x27;s son Alfonso II died without heirs in 1597, the House of Este lost Ferrara to the Papal States.

===Late modern and contemporary===

Ferrara, a university city second only to Bologna, remained a part of the Papal States for almost 300 years, an era marked by a steady decline; in 1792 the population of the town was only 27,000, less than in the 17th century. In 1805–1814 it was briefly part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, a client-state of the French Empire. After the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Ferrara was given back to the Pope, now guaranteed by the Empire of Austria. A bastion fort was erected in the 1600s by Pope Paul V on the site the Castel Tedaldo, an old castle at the south-west angle of the town, this was occupied by an Austrian garrison from 1832 until 1859. The fortress was completely dismantled following the birth of the Kingdom of Italy and the bricks were used for new constructions throughout the town.

During the last decades of the 1800s and the early 1900s, Ferrara remained a modest trade centre for its large rural hinterland that relied on commercial crops such as sugar beet and industrial hemp. Large land reclamation works were carried out for decades with the aim to expand the available arable land and eradicate malaria from the wetlands along the Po delta. Mass industrialisation came to Ferrara only at the end of the 1930s with the set-up of a chemical plant by the Fascist regime that should have supplied the regime with synthetic rubber. During the Second World War Ferrara was repeatedly bombed by Allied warplanes that targeted and destroyed railway links and industrial facilities. After the war, the industrial area in Pontelagoscuro was expanded to become a giant petrochemical compound operated by Montecatini and other companies, that at its peak employed 7,000 workers and produced 20% of plastics in Italy. In recent decades, as part of a general trend in Italy and Europe, Ferrara has come to rely more on tertiary and tourism, while the heavy industry, still present in the town, has been largely phased out.

After almost 450 years, another earthquake struck Ferrara in May 2012 causing only limited damage to the historic buildings of the town and no victims.

==Geography==
The town of Ferrara lies on the southern shores of the Po river, about north-east of the regional capital, Bologna, and south of Venice. The territory of the municipality, entirely part of the Padan plain, is overwhelmingly flat, situated on average just above sea-level. The proximity to the largest Italian river has been a constant concern in the history of Ferrara, that has been affected by recurrent, disastrous floods, the latest occurring as recently as 1951. The Idrovia Ferrarese links the river Po from Ferrara to the Adriatic at Porto Garibaldi.

===Climate===
The climate of the Po valley is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) under the Köppen climate classification, a type of climate commonly referred to as &quot;warm temperate&quot; that features mild winters and hot summers, heavy rains in spring and autumn but there is also a lot of rain even in the driest month of January for Ferrara.

==Government==

The legislative body of the Italian communes is the City Council (&quot;Consiglio Comunale&quot;), which, in towns having between 100,000 and 250,000 population, is composed by 32 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (&quot;Giunta Comunale&quot;), composed by 12 assessors, that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected mayor. The current mayor of Ferrara is Alan Fabbri of the . The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114), the Municipal Statute and several laws, notably the Legislative Decree 267/2000 or Unified Text on Local Administration (&quot;Testo Unico degli Enti Locali&quot;).

The current division of the seats in the city council, after the 2019 local election, is the following:

* – 14
* Democratic Party – 8
* Ferrara Change (centre-right) – 3
* – 2
* Fratelli d&#x27;Italia – 1
* Gente a Modo (centre-left) – 1

==Cityscape==

===Architecture===

The imposing Este Castle, sited in the very centre of the town, is iconic of Ferrara. A very large manor house featuring four massive bastions and a moat, it was erected in 1385 by architect Bartolino da Novara with the function to protect the town from external threats and to serve as a fortified residence for the Este family. It was extensively renovated in the 15th and 16th centuries.

The Cathedral of Saint George, designed by Wiligelmus and consecrated in 1135, is one of the finest examples of Romanesque architecture. The duomo has been renovated many times through the centuries, thus its resulting eclectic style is a harmonious combination of the Romanesque central structure and portal, the Gothic upper part of the façade and the Renaissance campanile. The sculptures of the main portal are attributed to . The upper part of the main façade, with arcades of pointed arches, dates from the 13th century. The recumbent marble lions guarding the portals are copies of the originals, now in the cathedral&#x27;s museum. An elaborated 13th-century relief depicting the Last Judgement is found in the second storey of the porch. The interior was restored in baroque style in 1712. The marble campanile attributed to Leon Battista Alberti was initiated in 1412 but is still incomplete, missing one projected additional storey and a dome, as it can be observed from numerous historical prints and paintings on the subject.

Near the cathedral and the castle also lies the 15th-century city hall, that served as an earlier residence of the Este family, featuring a grandiose marble flight of stairs and two ancient bronze statues of Niccolò III and Borso of Este.

The southern district is the town&#x27;s oldest, crossed by a myriad of narrow alleys that date back to the Early Middle Ages. is perhaps the best-preserved medieval building in Ferrara. It was the private residence of merchant Giovanni Romei, related by marriage to the Este family, and likely the work of the court architect Pietrobono Brasavola. Thanks to the nuns of the Corpus Domini order, much of the original decorations in the inner rooms have been saved. The house features fresco cycles in the &quot;Sala delle Sibille&quot; (&quot;room of sibyls&quot;), an original &quot;terracotta&quot; fireplace bearing the coat of arms of Giovanni Romei in the adjoining Saletta dei Profeti (&quot;room of the prophets&quot;), depicting allegories from the Bible, and in other rooms, some of which were commissioned by cardinal Ippolito d&#x27;Este, paintings by the school of Camillo and Cesare Filippi (16th century).

Palazzo Schifanoia was built in 1385 for Alberto V d&#x27;Este. The palazzo includes frescoes depicting the life of Borso d&#x27;Este, the signs of the zodiac and allegorical representations of the months. The vestibule was decorated with &quot;stucco&quot; mouldings by . The building also contains fine choir-books with miniatures and a collection of coins and Renaissance medals. The Renaissance Palazzo Paradiso, part of the Ferrara University library system, displays part of the manuscript of &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; and letters by Tasso as well as Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s grave. Its famous alumni include Nicolaus Copernicus and Paracelsus.

The northern quarter, which was added by Ercole I in 1492–1505 thanks to the master plan of Biagio Rossetti, and hence called the &quot;Addizione Erculea&quot;, features a number of Renaissance &quot;palazzi&quot;. Among the finest is Palazzo dei Diamanti (&quot;Diamond Palace&quot;), named after the diamond points into which the façade&#x27;s stone blocks are cut. The &quot;palazzo&quot; houses the National Picture Gallery, with a large collection of the school of Ferrara, which first rose to prominence in the latter half of the 15th century, with Cosimo Tura, Francesco Cossa and Ercole dei Roberti. Noted masters of the 16th-century School of Ferrara include Lorenzo Costa and Dosso Dossi, the most eminent of all, Girolamo da Carpi and Benvenuto Tisi (il Garofalo). The district is also home to University of Ferrara Botanic Garden.

===Parks and gardens===

The town is still almost totally encircled by of ancient brick walls, mostly built between 1492 and 1520. Today the walls, after a careful restoration, make up a large urban park around the town and are a popular destination for joggers and cyclists.

==Demographics==
In 2007, there were 135,369 people residing in Ferrara, of whom 46.8% were male and 53.2% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 12.28% of the population compared to pensioners who number 26.41%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Ferrara residents is 49, compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Ferrara grew by 2.28%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%. The current birth rate of Ferrara is 7.02 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. Ferrara is known as the oldest Italian city with a population over 100,000, as well the city with lowest birth rate.

, 95.59% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group was other European nations with Ukraine and Albania: 2.59% followed by North Africa: 0.51%, and East Asia: 0.39%. The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, with small Orthodox Christian adherents. The historical Jewish community is still surviving.

==Culture==

===Jewish community===

The Jewish community of Ferrara is the only one in Emilia Romagna with a continuous presence from the Middle Ages to the present day. It played an important role when Ferrara enjoyed its greatest splendor in the 15th and 16th century, with the duke Ercole I d&#x27;Este. The situation of the Jews deteriorated in 1598, when the Este dynasty moved to Modena and the city came under papal control. The Jewish settlement, located in three streets forming a triangle near the cathedral, became a ghetto in 1627. Apart from a few years under Napoleon and during the 1848 revolution, the ghetto lasted until Italian unification in 1859.

In 1799, the Jewish community saved the city from sacking by troops of the Holy Roman Empire. During the spring of 1799, the city had fallen into the hands of the Republic of France, which established a small garrison there. On 15 April, Lieutenant Field Marshal Johann von Klenau approached the fortress with a modest mixed force of Austrian cavalry, artillery and infantry augmented by Italian peasant rebels, commanded by Count Antonio Bardaniand and demanded its capitulation. The commander refused. Klenau blockaded the city, leaving a small group of artillery and troops to continue the siege. For the next three days, Klenau patrolled the countryside, capturing the surrounding strategic points of Lagoscuro, Borgoforte and the Mirandola fortress. The besieged garrison made several sorties from the Saint Paul&#x27;s Gate, which were repulsed by the insurgent peasants. The French attempted two rescues of the beleaguered fortress: the first, on 24 April, when a force of 400 Modenese was repulsed at Mirandola and the second, General Montrichard tried to raise the city-blockade by advancing with a force of 4,000. Finally, at the end of the month, a column led by Pierre-Augustin Hulin reached and relieved the fortress.

Klenau took possession of the town on 21 May, and garrisoned it with a light battalion. The Jewish residents of Ferrara paid 30,000 ducats to prevent the pillage of the city by Klenau&#x27;s forces; this was used to pay the wages of Gardani&#x27;s troops. Although Klenau held the town, the French still possessed the town&#x27;s fortress. After making the standard request for surrender at 08:00, which was refused, Klenau ordered a barrage from his mortars and howitzers. After two magazines caught fire, the commandant was summoned again to surrender; there was some delay, but a flag of truce was sent at 21:00, and the capitulation was concluded at 01:00 the next day. Upon taking possession of the fortress, Klenau found 75 new artillery pieces, plus ammunition and six months worth of provisions.

In 1938, Mussolini&#x27;s fascist government instituted racial laws reintroducing segregation of Jews which lasted until the end of the German occupation. During the Second World War, 96 of Ferrara&#x27;s 300 Jews were deported to German concentration and death camps; five survived. The Italian Jewish writer, Giorgio Bassani, was from Ferrara. His celebrated book, &quot;The Garden of the Finzi-Continis&quot;, was published in Italian as Giardino dei Finzi-Contini, 1962, by Giulio Einaudi editore s.p.a. It was made into a film by Vittorio de Sica in 1970.

During WWII, the Este Castle, adjacent to the Corso Roma, now known as the Corso Martiri della Libertà, was the site of an infamous massacre in 1943.

On December 13, 2017, the first day of Hanukkah, Italy&#x27;s Museum of Italian Judaism and the Shoah opened on the site of a restored two-story brick prison built in 1912 that counted Jews among its detainees during the Fascist period. This is the initial phase of a project—known as MEIS, after its initials in Italian—to be completed in 2021, with additional buildings that will create a major Jewish cultural hub and add exhibits focusing on the Jews in the Italian Renaissance and the Shoah.

===Visual art===

During the Renaissance the Este family, well known for its patronage of the arts, welcomed a great number of artists, especially painters, that formed the so-called School of Ferrara. The astounding list of painters and artists includes the names of Andrea Mantegna, Vicino da Ferrara, Giovanni Bellini, Leon Battista Alberti, Pisanello, Piero della Francesca, Battista Dossi, Dosso Dossi, Cosmé Tura, Francesco del Cossa and Titian. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Ferrara again hosted and inspired numerous painters who grew fond of its eerie atmosphere. Among them Giovanni Boldini, Filippo de Pisis and Giorgio de Chirico. A large collection of paintings is displayed in the National Gallery of Palazzo dei Diamanti.

===Literature===

The Renaissance literary men and poets Torquato Tasso (author of &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;), Ludovico Ariosto (author of the romantic epic poem &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;) and Matteo Maria Boiardo (author of the grandiose poem of chivalry and romance &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;) lived and worked at the court of Ferrara during the 15th and 16th century.

The &quot;Ferrara Bible&quot; was a 1553 publication of the Ladino version of the Tanakh used by Sephardi Jews. It was paid for and made by Yom-Tob ben Levi Athias (the Spanish Marrano &quot;Jerónimo de Vargas&quot;, as typographer) and Abraham ben Salomon Usque (the Portuguese Jew &quot;Duarte Pinhel&quot;, as translator), and was dedicated to Ercole II d&#x27;Este. In the 20th century, Ferrara was the home and workplace of writer Giorgio Bassani, well known for his novels that were often adapted for cinema (&quot;The Garden of the Finzi-Continis&quot;, &quot;Long Night in 1943&quot;). In historical fiction, British author Sarah Dunant set her 2009 novel &quot;Sacred Hearts&quot; in a convent in Ferrara.

===Religion===

Ferrara gave birth to Girolamo Savonarola, the famous medieval Dominican priest and leader of Florence from 1494 until his execution in 1498. He was known for his book burning, destruction of what he considered immoral art, and hostility to the Renaissance. He vehemently preached against the moral corruption of much of the clergy at the time, and his main opponent was Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia).

During the time that Renée of France was Duchess of Ferrara, her court attracted Protestant thinkers such as John Calvin and Olympia Fulvia Morata. The court became hostile to Protestant sympathizers after the marriage of Renée&#x27;s daughter Anna d&#x27;Este to the fervently Catholic Duke of Guise.

===Music===
The Ferrarese musician Girolamo Frescobaldi was one of the most important composers of keyboard music in the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods. His masterpiece &quot;Fiori musicali&quot; (&quot;Musical Flowers&quot;) is a collection of liturgical organ music first published in 1635. It became the most famous of Frescobaldi&#x27;s works and was studied centuries after his death by numerous composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach. Maurizio Moro (15??–16??) an Italian poet of the 16th century best known for madrigals is thought to have been born in Ferrara.

===Cinema===

Ferrara is the birthplace of Italian film directors Michelangelo Antonioni and Florestano Vancini. The latter shot in Ferrara his 1960 film &quot;Long Night in 1943&quot;. The town was also the setting of the famous 1970 movie &quot;The Garden of the Finzi-Continis&quot; by Vittorio De Sica, that tells the vicissitudes of a rich Jewish family during the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini and World War II. Furthermore, Wim Wenders and Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Clouds&quot; in (1995) and Ermanno Olmi&#x27;s &quot;The Profession of Arms&quot; in (2001), a film about the last days of Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, were also shot in Ferrara.

In the third season of &quot;Medici (TV Series)&quot;, Girolamo Riario&#x27;s men seize Ferrara, 100 miles from Florence and takes their salt. Based on the actions by Riario, Pope Sixtus IV condemns Riario and accepts Lorenzo&#x27;s invitation to a peace conference in Bagnolo. The attack by Riario’s men on Ferrara was filmed at Castle of Oliveto in Castelfiorentino, once the residence of the noble Pucci family of Florence.

===Festivals===

The Palio of St. George is a medieval-themed horse race held every last Sunday of May. Established in 1279, it is probably the oldest such competition in the world. The Ferrara Buskers Festival is a non-competitive parade of street musicians from all over the world. At the 2017 edition, more than 1,000 artists from 35 different nations took part in the festival, including dancers, clowns, equilibrists, jugglers and other original performers. Additionally, the town hosts the yearly Ferrara Balloons Festival, a large hot-air balloon show.

===Sport===
The town&#x27;s football team, SPAL, was established in 1907. In 2017 it was promoted to Serie A, Italy&#x27;s top-level football league, after a 49-year absence. Its home ground is Paolo Mazza Memorial Stadium, with a capacity of 16,134.

Ferrara&#x27;s basketball team Kleb Basket Ferrara competes in the Serie A2 Basket and plays its home games at the Palasport di Ferrara.

===Cuisine===

The culinary tradition of Ferrara features many typical dishes that can be traced back to the Middle Ages, and that sometimes reveals the influence of its important Jewish community.

The signature dish is &quot;cappellacci di zucca&quot;, special ravioli with a filling of butternut squash, Parmesan and flavored with nutmeg. It is served with a sauce of butter and sage or bolognese sauce. Another peculiar dish, that was allegedly cooked by Renaissance chef Cristoforo di Messisbugo, is &quot;pasticcio di maccheroni&quot;, a domed macaroni pie, consisting of a crust of sweet dough enclosing macaroni in a Béchamel sauce, studded with porcini mushrooms and &quot;ragù alla bolognese&quot;.

The traditional Christmas first course is &quot;cappelletti&quot;, large meat filled ravioli served in chicken broth. It is often followed by &quot;salama da sugo&quot;, a very big, cured sausage made from a selection of pork meats and spices kneaded with red wine.

Seafood is also an important part of the local tradition, that boast rich fisheries in the Po delta lagoons and Adriatic sea. Pasta with clams and grilled or stewed eel dishes are especially well-known. Popular food items include also &quot;zia&quot; garlic salami and the traditional &quot;coppia&quot; bread, protected by the IGP (protected geographical status) label. Not unusual is the typical kosher salami made of goose meat stuffed in goose neck skin.

Local patisserie include spicy &quot;pampepato&quot; chocolate pie, &quot;tenerina&quot;, a dark chocolate and butter cake, and &quot;zuppa inglese&quot;, a chocolate and custard pudding on a bed of sponge cake soaked in Alchermes. The clay terroir of the area, an alluvial plain created by the river Po, is not ideal for wine; a notable exception is Bosco Eliceo (DOC) wine, made from grapes cultivated on the sandy coast line.

<text>Agritourism or agrotourism involves any agriculturally based operation or activity that brings visitors to a farm or ranch. It encompasses a wide range of activities, including direct-to-consumer sales such as farm stands and u-pick, agricultural education through school visits, hospitality services like overnight farm stays, recreational activities such as hunting and horseback riding, and entertainment events like hayrides and harvest dinners. These activities provide an additional source of income for farmers and help sustain small-scale farms.

Agritourism benefits surrounding communities by drawing tourists to rural areas, stimulating local economies, and fostering a greater appreciation for agricultural practices and local food systems. Many countries have embraced agritourism, implementing programs and initiatives to support and promote this sector.

==Types==
A 2018 article published in the &quot;Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development&quot; classified agritourism activities as falling into one or more categories: direct-to-consumer sales (e.g., farm stands, u-pick), agricultural education (e.g., schools visits to a farm), hospitality (overnight farm stays), recreation (e.g., hunting, horseback riding), and entertainment (e.g., hayrides, harvest dinners). Most agritourists spent time visiting farm stands, picking fruit, or feeding animals; others may navigate a corn maze or do a farm stay, assisting with chores or agricultural or ranch work.

*Indirect approaches: Agricultural products are sold to tourist facilities. Examples include farmers&#x27; markets where local products are sold directly to tourists.
*Direct approaches: Providers are engaged in both agriculture and tourism. Activities include visits to wineries, pick-your-own fields, agricultural information centers, farm stays, and harvest festivals.

== Economic benefits ==
Agricultural tourism has become a necessary means for many small farms’ survival. By diversifying business operations, farm operators are able to ensure a more stable income. This is because agritourism activities can occur during times of the year that crops may not be in season, and by providing a completely separate stream of income. Some studies have found that agritourism operations often benefit their surrounding communities by drawing tourists to the area. The economic boost by the increase in traffic can be beneficial to rural areas in need of diversified streams of income.

== Agritourism in various countries ==
=== Armenia ===
The development of agritourism was of high importance in the process of revitalization of rural life in Armenia. Apart from participation in agricultural activities and farming, some more notable activities specific to Armenia are winemaking and carpet weaving.

There are also agricultural festivals and farmer&#x27;s fairs organized every year, like the &quot;Dolma&quot; festival, &quot;Barbeque (Khorovats)&quot; festival, &quot;Gata&quot; festival, and many more.

===India===
85% of India&#x27;s population is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture and allied activities. Similarly, agriculture accounts for 26% of India&#x27;s GDP. Maharashtra and Kerala are the states in India that are taking advantage of the potential of agritourism. In Maharashtra Agritourism is promoted by the Agri Tourism Development Corporation. Kuttanad, Wayanad, Palakkad and Idukki are some of the important agricultural areas in Kerala. The &#x27;Green Farm&#x27; project launched by the Government of Kerala is aimed at promoting agro-tourism in Kerala. Apart from Kerala and Maharashtra, Nagaland and Sikkim are also successful agri-tourism states.

===Italy===

Since 1985 agritourism in Italy is formally regulated by a state law, amended in 2006.

Starting in 2013 Italy has used a sector trademark, “Agriturismo Italia”, accompanied by a new system of classification of farms with accommodation.&lt;br&gt;The trademark, which distinguishes farms regularly operating in accordance with existing laws and regulations, shows a sunflower enclosing a farm.&lt;br&gt;
The classification (from 1 to 5 marks) represents the level of comfort, the variety of services and the quality of the natural environment that each farm is able to offer.&lt;br&gt;
This system was implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, in cooperation with all regional and national agritourism associations.&lt;br&gt;
The national system thus offers an overall guarantee which still takes account of specific regional characteristics.

===Israel===

In Israel, historical agricultural practices attract visitors to sites such as Ein Yael, Neot Kedumim, and Kfar Kedem. These locations showcase traditional methods like terraced farming and ancient irrigation. Tourists can engage in activities such as grape stomping and olive pressing.

Israel&#x27;s agriculture features crops like grapes, olives, dates, and wheat, which have historical significance. The Wine Route and Olive Route in the Mate Yehuda and Yoav regions allow visitors to explore small wineries and ancient and modern oil presses. The Dagon Museum in Haifa displays the history of grain cultivation from ancient times to the present. Binyamina, known for its citrus groves, and Kibbutz Ein Gedi near the Dead Sea, which demonstrates desert farming techniques, are also key agritourism sites.

For insights into the development of modern agriculture, tourists can visit the Dubrovin Farm museum and the Museum of Pioneer Settlement at Kibbutz Yifat. These sites depict the establishment of Israel&#x27;s agricultural infrastructure in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Pakistan===
Pakistan is an agricultural country and agriculture is a vital sector of Pakistan&#x27;s economy. About 65% of people live in rural areas and directly or indirectly relate to profession of agriculture. Agriculture in Pakistan accounts 21% of total GDP in the economy. Pakistan has natural resources for agriculture, like fertile land, four seasons, and a natural flow of water canals from north to south, including dams, barrages, headwork, canals, and distribution channels.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
UAE unveiled a pioneering plan in 2023, aimed at revamping the agricultural industry, opening up an array of opportunities for farmers to diversify their income streams to promote agritourism. The &#x27;UAE Agritourism Program&#x27; allows people to experience conventional and modern agricultural practices at animal and crop farms, whilst aiming to increase the demand for locally grown produce. A new agritourism hub is also expected to create thousands of new jobs.

===United States===
Through the Small Farm Center at the University of California, &quot;Agricultural tourism or agritourism, is one alternative for improving the incomes and potential economic viability of small farms and rural communities. Some forms of agritourism enterprises are well developed in California, including fairs and festivals. Other possibilities still offer potential for development&quot;. The UC Small Farm Center has developed a California Agritourism Database that &quot;provides visitors and potential entrepreneurs with information about existing agritourism locations throughout the state&quot;. An example of agritourism in the U.S. may be Tanaka Farms.

===United Kingdom===
According to a 2011 article in the journal &quot;Tourism Planning and Development&quot;, agritourism has become economically important to the agriculture sector in North West England, as farmers seek to diversify their income streams.

<doc id="45848" wikidata="Q101505" url="?curid=45848" title="Deep Purple">
<text>Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in London in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical style has varied throughout their career. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album &quot;Deep Purple in Rock&quot;. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the &quot;unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies&quot;. Listed in the 1975 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as &quot;the globe&#x27;s loudest band&quot; for a 1972 concert at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre, they have sold over 100 million records worldwide.

Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and disbanded for eight years from 1976 to 1984, with drummer Ian Paice being the band&#x27;s only constant member. The first four line-ups, which constituted the band&#x27;s original 1968–1976 run, are officially indicated as Mark I (1968–1969), Mark II (1969–1973), Mark III (1973–1975) and Mark IV (1975–1976). Mark I comprised the founding members of Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Rod Evans (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards), Paice (drums) and Nick Simper (bass), while Mark II was the most influential and commercially successful line-up, with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover replacing Evans and Simper respectively. Mark III saw David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes replace Gillan and Glover respectively, while Mark IV featured Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore. The band split in July 1976, and Bolin died from a drug overdose five months later. Deep Purple reformed in 1984 with the Mark II line-up, which remained in place until Joe Lynn Turner replaced Gillan in 1989. Gillan rejoined in 1992, and Blackmore left for the second and final time the following year. He was replaced temporarily by Joe Satriani and then permanently by Steve Morse. In 2002, Lord retired and was replaced by Don Airey, which saw Deep Purple settle into its longest running line-up, unchanged for the next twenty years, until Morse announced his departure from the band in 2022. His place was taken by Simon McBride. Paice, Glover, Gillan, Airey and McBride comprise the current line-up of Deep Purple.

Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; programme, and a poll on radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the &quot;most influential bands ever&quot;. The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Deep Purple (specifically Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Gillan, Glover, Coverdale, Evans, and Hughes) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.

==History==
===Beginnings (1967–1968)===
In 1967, former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis contacted London businessman Tony Edwards, in the hope he would manage a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. Curtis&#x27; vision was a &quot;supergroup&quot; where the band members would get on and off, like a musical roundabout. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance the venture with his two business partners John Coletta and Ron Hire, who composed Hire-Edwards-Coletta Enterprises (HEC).

The first recruit to the band was classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord, Curtis&#x27;s flatmate, who had most notably played with the Artwoods (led by Art Wood, brother of future Faces and Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and including Keef Hartley). Lord was then performing in a backing band for the vocal group The Flower Pot Men, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little (Simper had previously been in Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, and survived the 1966 car crash that killed Kidd). Lord alerted the two that he had been recruited for the Roundabout project, after which Simper and Little suggested guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whom Lord had never met. Simper had known Blackmore since the early 1960s when his first band, the Renegades, debuted around the same time as one of Blackmore&#x27;s early bands, the Dominators.

HEC persuaded Blackmore to travel in from Hamburg to audition for the new group. He was making a name for himself as a studio session guitarist, and had also been a member of the Outlaws, Screaming Lord Sutch, and Neil Christian, the latter artist prompting Blackmore&#x27;s move to Germany. Curtis&#x27;s erratic behaviour and lifestyle, fuelled by his use of LSD, caused him to display a sudden lack of interest in the project he had started, forcing HEC to dismiss him from Roundabout. However, HEC was now intrigued with the possibilities Lord and Blackmore brought and persuaded Ritchie to return from Hamburg a second time. Lord and Blackmore began the recruitment of additional members, retaining Tony Edwards as their manager. Lord convinced Nick Simper to join on bass, but Blackmore insisted they leave Carlo Little behind in favour of drummer Bobby Woodman. Woodman was the former drummer for Vince Taylor&#x27;s Play-Boys (for whom he had played under the name Bobbie Clarke). The band, still calling themselves Roundabout, started rehearsing and writing in Cadogan Gardens in South Kensington.

In March 1968, Lord, Blackmore, Simper and Woodman moved into Deeves Hall, a country house in South Mimms, Hertfordshire. The band would live, write and rehearse at the house; it was fully kitted out with the latest Marshall amplification and, at Lord&#x27;s request, a Hammond C3 organ. According to Simper, &quot;dozens&quot; of singers were auditioned (including Rod Stewart and Woodman&#x27;s friend Dave Curtiss) until the group heard Rod Evans of club band the Maze, and thought his voice fitted their style well. Tagging along with Evans was his band&#x27;s drummer Ian Paice. Blackmore had seen an 18-year-old Paice on tour with the Maze in Germany in 1966, and had been impressed by his drumming. The band hastily arranged an audition for Paice, given that Woodman was vocally unhappy with the direction of the band&#x27;s music. Both Paice and Evans won their respective jobs, and the line-up was complete.

During a brief tour of Denmark and Sweden in April, in which they were still billed as Roundabout, Blackmore suggested a new name: Deep Purple, after his grandmother&#x27;s favourite song, &quot;Deep Purple&quot; by Peter DeRose. The group had resolved to choose a name after everyone had posted one on a board in rehearsal. Second to Deep Purple was &quot;Concrete God&quot;, which the band thought was too harsh to take on.

=== Mark I (1968–1969): &quot;Shades of Deep Purple, The Book of Taliesyn&quot; and &quot;Deep Purple&quot; ===

In May 1968, the band moved into Pye Studios in London&#x27;s Marble Arch to record their debut album, &quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot;, which was released in America in July by Tetragrammaton Records, and in Britain in September by EMI Records. Vanilla Fudge was a notable influence on the band, with Blackmore claiming that the group started out wanting to be a &quot;Vanilla Fudge clone&quot;. The group had success in North America with a cover of Joe South&#x27;s &quot;Hush&quot;, and by September 1968, the song had reached number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US and number 2 in the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; chart, pushing the &quot;Shades&quot; LP up to No. 24 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop albums chart. The following month, Deep Purple were booked to support Cream on the US leg of their &quot;Goodbye&quot; tour.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Book of Taliesyn&quot;, was recorded quickly and released in North America in October 1968 to coincide with the tour. The album included Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Kentucky Woman&quot;, which cracked the Top 40 in both the US (No. 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart) and Canada (No. 21 on the &quot;RPM&quot; chart), though sales for the album were not as strong (No. 54 in US, No. 48 in Canada). &quot;The Book of Taliesyn&quot; would not be released in the band&#x27;s home country until the following year and, like its predecessor, it failed to have much impact on the UK Albums Chart.

Early in 1969, the band released the non-album single &quot;Emmaretta&quot;, named after Emmaretta Marks, at that time a cast member of the musical &quot;Hair&quot;, whom Evans was trying to seduce. By March of that year, the band had completed recording for their third album, &quot;Deep Purple&quot;. The album included the track &quot;April&quot;, which featured strings and woodwind, showcasing Lord&#x27;s classical antecedents such as Bach and Rimsky-Korsakov. 

Deep Purple&#x27;s North American record label, Tetragrammaton, delayed production of the &quot;Deep Purple&quot; album until after the band&#x27;s 1969 American tour ended. This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100. Soon after &quot;Deep Purple&quot; was finally released in late June 1969, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future (Tetragrammaton&#x27;s assets were eventually assumed by Warner Bros. Records, who would release Deep Purple&#x27;s records in the US throughout the 1970s).

During the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to progress the heavy rock side of the band further. Having decided that Evans and Simper would not fit well with the style they envisioned, both were replaced that summer. Paice stated, &quot;A change had to come. If they hadn&#x27;t left, the band would have totally disintegrated.&quot; Both Simper and Blackmore noted that Rod Evans already had one foot out of the door. Simper said that Evans had met a girl in Hollywood and had eyes on being an actor, while Blackmore explained, &quot;Rod just wanted to go to America and live in America.&quot; Evans and Simper would go on to co-form the bands Captain Beyond and Warhorse respectively.

=== Mark II (1969–1973): &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot;, &quot;In Rock&quot;, &quot;Fireball&quot;, &quot;Machine Head&quot;, &quot;Made in Japan&quot; and &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; ===

Deep Purple Mark II was formed in Hanwell Community Centre in West London in the summer of 1969. In search of a new vocalist, Blackmore set his own sights on 19-year-old singer Terry Reid. Though he found the offer &quot;flattering&quot;, Reid was still bound by an exclusive recording contract with his producer Mickie Most and more interested in his solo career. Blackmore had no other choice but to look elsewhere. The band sought out singer Ian Gillan from Episode Six, a band that had released several singles in the UK without achieving any great commercial success. Six&#x27;s drummer Mick Underwood – an old comrade of Blackmore&#x27;s from his days in the Outlaws – introduced the band to Gillan and bassist Roger Glover. According to Nick Simper, &quot;Gillan would join only with Roger Glover.&quot; This effectively killed Episode Six, which gave Underwood a persistent feeling of guilt that lasted nearly a decade, until Gillan recruited him for his new post-Purple band in the late 1970s. According to Blackmore, Deep Purple was only interested in Gillan and not Glover, but Glover was retained on the advice of Ian Paice.

Mark II&#x27;s first release was a Roger Greenaway–Roger Cook tune titled &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. At the time of its recording, Nick Simper still thought he was in the band and had called John Coletta to inquire about the recording dates for the song. He then found that the song had already been recorded with Glover on bass. The remaining original members of Deep Purple then instructed management to inform Simper that he had been officially replaced. Despite television appearances to promote the &quot;Hallelujah&quot; single in the UK, the song flopped. Blackmore had told the British weekly music newspaper &quot;Record Mirror&quot; that the band &quot;need to have a commercial record in Britain&quot;, and described the song as &quot;an in-between sort of thing&quot;—a compromise between the type of material the band would normally record, and openly commercial material.

In September 1969, the band gained some much-needed publicity in the UK with the &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot;, a three-movement epic composed by Lord as a solo project and performed by the band at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Malcolm Arnold. Alongside &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; by the Moody Blues and &quot;Five Bridges&quot; by the Nice, it was one of the first collaborations between a rock band and an orchestra. This live album became their first release with any kind of chart success in the UK. Gillan and Blackmore were less than happy at the band being tagged as &quot;a group who played with orchestras&quot;, both feeling that the &quot;Concerto&quot; was a distraction that would get in the way of developing their desired hard-rocking style. Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance &quot;you could have put the five smiles together and spanned the Thames.&quot; Lord would also write the &quot;Gemini Suite&quot;, another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970, although the band&#x27;s recording of the piece would not be released until 1993. In 1975, Blackmore stated that he thought the &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot; was not bad but that the &quot;Gemini Suite&quot; was horrible and very disjointed. Roger Glover later noted that Jon Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band in the early years.

Shortly after the orchestral release, Mark II began a hectic touring and recording schedule that was to see little respite for the next four years. The second album, and first studio album, of the Mark II era, released in 1970, was &quot;In Rock&quot; (a name supported by the album&#x27;s Mount Rushmore-inspired cover), which contained the then-concert staples &quot;Speed King&quot;, &quot;Into The Fire&quot; and &quot;Child in Time&quot;. The non-album single &quot;Black Night&quot;, released around the same time, finally put Deep Purple into the UK Top Ten. The interplay between Blackmore&#x27;s guitar and Lord&#x27;s distorted organ, coupled with Gillan&#x27;s powerful, wide-ranging vocals and the rhythm section of Glover and Paice, now started to take on a unique identity that separated the band from its earlier albums. Along with Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; and Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;In Rock&quot; codified the budding heavy metal genre.

On the album&#x27;s development, Blackmore stated: &quot;I got fed up with playing with classical orchestras, and thought, &#x27;well, this is my turn.&#x27; Jon was into more classical. I said, &#x27;well you&#x27;ve done that, I&#x27;ll do rock, and whatever turns out best we&#x27;ll carry on with.&#x27;&quot; &quot;In Rock&quot; performed well, especially in the UK where it reached No. 4, while the &quot;Black Night&quot; single reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and the band performed the song live on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. In addition to increasing sales in the UK, the band were making a name for themselves as a live act, particularly with regard to the sheer volume of their shows and the improvisational skills of Blackmore and Lord. Said Lord, &quot;We took from jazz, we took from old fashioned rock and roll, we took from the classics. Ritchie and myself...used to swap musical jokes and attacks. He would play something, and I&#x27;d have to see if I could match it. That provided a sense of humour, a sense of tension to the band, a sense of, &#x27;what the hell&#x27;s going to happen next?&#x27; The audience didn&#x27;t know, and nine times out of ten, neither did we!&quot;

A second Mark II studio album, the creatively progressive &quot;Fireball&quot;, was issued in the summer of 1971, reaching number 1 on the UK Albums Chart. The title track &quot;Fireball&quot; was released as a single, as was &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot;, not from the album but recorded during the same sessions (although it replaced &quot;Demon&#x27;s Eye&quot; on the US version of the album). &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; became their second UK Top 10 single, reaching No. 8.

Within weeks of &quot;Fireball&quot;″s release, the band were already performing songs planned for the next album. One song (which later became &quot;Highway Star&quot;) was performed at the first show of the &quot;Fireball&quot; tour, having been written on the bus to a show in Portsmouth, in answer to a journalist&#x27;s question: &quot;How do you go about writing songs?&quot; On 24 October 1971 during the US leg of the Fireball tour, the band was set to play the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago when Ian Gillan contracted hepatitis, forcing the band to play without him, with bassist Glover singing the set. After this, the rest of the US dates were cancelled and the band flew home.

In early December 1971, the band travelled to Switzerland to record &quot;Machine Head&quot;. The album was due to be recorded at the Montreux Casino using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, but a fire during a Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention concert, caused by a man firing a flare gun into the ceiling, burned down the Casino. This incident famously inspired the song &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. The album was later recorded in a corridor at the nearby empty Grand Hôtel de Territet, with the exception of the music track to &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. That was recorded at a vacant theatre called The Pavillon before the band was asked to leave. On recording &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, Blackmore stated to BBC Radio 2: &quot;We did the whole thing in about four takes because we had to. The police were banging on the door. We knew it was the police, but we had such a good sound in this hall. We were waking up all the neighbours for about five miles in Montreux, because it was echo-ing through the mountains. I was just getting the last part of the riff down, we&#x27;d just finished it, when the police burst in and said &#x27;you&#x27;ve got to stop&#x27;. We had the track down.&quot;

Continuing to progress the musical direction of the previous two albums, &quot;Machine Head&quot; was released in late March 1972 and became one of the band&#x27;s most famous releases. It was the band&#x27;s second No. 1 album in the UK while re-establishing them in North America, hitting No. 7 in the US and No. 1 in Canada. It included tracks that became live classics, such as &quot;Highway Star&quot;, &quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Lazy&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, the last of which remains Deep Purple&#x27;s most famous song. They continued to tour and record at a rate that would be rare thirty years on; when &quot;Machine Head&quot; was recorded, the group had only been together three-and-a-half years, yet it was their sixth studio album and seventh album overall.

In January 1972, the band returned to tour the US once again. They then headed over to play Europe before resuming US dates in March. While in America, Blackmore contracted hepatitis, and the band attempted one show in Flint, Michigan, without a guitarist before attempting to acquire the services of Al Kooper, who rehearsed with the band before bowing out, suggesting Spirit guitarist Randy California instead. California played one show with the group, in Quebec City, Quebec on 6 April, but the rest of this tour was cancelled as well.

The band returned to the US in late May 1972 to undertake their third North America tour (of four total that year). A Japan tour in August of that year led to a double live album, &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. Originally intended as a Japan-only release, its worldwide release became an instant hit, reaching platinum status in five countries, including the US. It remains one of rock music&#x27;s most popular and highest selling live albums.

Mark II continued to work and released the album &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; in 1973. Spawning the hit single &quot;Woman from Tokyo&quot;, the album hit No. 4 in the UK charts and No. 15 in the US chart, while achieving gold record status faster than any Deep Purple album released up to that time. However, internal tensions and exhaustion were more noticeable than ever. Following the successes of &quot;Machine Head&quot; and &quot;Made in Japan&quot;, the addition of &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; made Deep Purple the top-selling artists of 1973 in the US.

Gillan admitted in a 1984 interview that the band was pushed by management to complete the &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; album on time and go on tour, although they badly needed a break. The bad feelings, including tensions with Blackmore, culminated in Gillan quitting the band after their second tour of Japan in the summer of 1973, followed by the dismissal of Glover, at Blackmore&#x27;s insistence. In interviews later, Lord called the end of Mark II while the band was at its peak &quot;the biggest shame in rock and roll; God knows what we would have done over the next three or four years. We were writing so well.&quot;

===Mark III (1973–1975): &quot;Burn&quot; and &quot;Stormbringer&quot;===

The band hired Midlands bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, formerly of Trapeze. According to Paice, Glover told him and Lord a few months before his official termination that he wanted to leave the band, so they had started to drop in on Trapeze shows. After acquiring Hughes, they debated continuing as a four-piece, with Hughes as bassist and lead vocalist. According to Hughes, he was told the band was bringing in Paul Rodgers of Free as a co-lead vocalist, but by that time Rodgers had just started Bad Company. &quot;They did ask&quot;, Rodgers recalled, &quot;and I spoke to all of them at length about the possibility. Purple had toured Australia with Free&#x27;s final lineup. I didn&#x27;t do it because I was very much into the idea of forming Bad Company.&quot; Instead, auditions were held for lead vocal replacements. They settled on David Coverdale, an unknown singer from Saltburn in north-east England, primarily because Blackmore liked his masculine, blues-tinged voice.

&quot;Burn&quot;, the first album by Deep Purple Mark III, was released in February 1974 to great success, reaching No. 3 in the UK and No. 9 in the US, and was followed by another world tour. The title track, which opens the album and would open most concerts during the Mark III and IV eras, was a conscious effort by the band to embrace the progressive rock movement, which was popularised at the time by bands such as Yes, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Genesis and Gentle Giant. Another notable song from the album was a slow-burning blues number called &quot;Mistreated&quot;.

Mark III embarked on a spring tour that included shows at Madison Square Garden, New York, on 13 March, and Nassau Coliseum four days later. The band co-headlined (with Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer) the California Jam festival at Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, southern California, on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 250,000 fans, the festival also included 1970s rock giants Black Sabbath, Eagles, Seals &amp; Crofts and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the US, exposing the band to a wider audience. During the show, Blackmore doused his amplifiers with petrol and set them on fire, blowing a hole in the stage. A month later, the band&#x27;s 22 May performance at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, London, was recorded and later released in 1982 as &quot;Live in London&quot;.

Hughes and Coverdale brought vocal harmonies and elements of funk and blues, respectively, to the band&#x27;s music, a sound that was even more apparent on the late 1974 release &quot;Stormbringer&quot;. Along with the title track, the &quot;Stormbringer&quot; album had a number of songs that received significant radio play, such as &quot;Lady Double Dealer&quot;, &quot;The Gypsy&quot; and &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, and the album reached No. 6 in the UK and No. 20 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Blackmore publicly disliked most of the album, however, derisively calling it &quot;shoeshine music&quot; out of distaste for its funk and soul elements. A new live album, &quot;Made in Europe&quot;, culled from three shows on the &quot;Stormbringer&quot; tour, was assembled during the summer of 1975, but would not see release until late 1976. Blackmore left the band on 21 June 1975 to form his own band with Ronnie James Dio of Elf, called Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow, shortened to Rainbow after the first album.

=== Mark IV (1975–1976): &quot;Come Taste the Band&quot;===

Following Blackmore&#x27;s departure, the group considered disbanding but decided to continue and find another guitarist. Clem Clempson (Colosseum, Humble Pie), Zal Cleminson (The Sensational Alex Harvey Band), Mick Ronson (The Spiders From Mars) and Rory Gallagher were considered, and the final choice was American Tommy Bolin. There are at least two versions of the Bolin recruitment story: Coverdale claims to have been the one who suggested auditioning Bolin. &quot;He walked in, thin as a rake, his hair coloured green, yellow and blue with feathers in it. Slinking along beside him was this stunning Hawaiian girl in a crochet dress with nothing on underneath. He plugged into four Marshall 100-watt stacks and...the job was his.&quot; But in an interview published by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in June 1975, Bolin claimed that he came to the audition following a recommendation from Blackmore. Bolin had been a member of many late-1960s bands – Denny &amp; The Triumphs, American Standard, and Zephyr, which released three albums from 1969 to 1972. Before he joined Deep Purple, Bolin&#x27;s best-known recordings had been made as a session musician on Billy Cobham&#x27;s 1973 jazz fusion album &quot;Spectrum&quot;, and as lead guitarist on two post-Joe Walsh James Gang albums: &quot;Bang&quot; (1973) and &quot;Miami&quot; (1974). He had also played with Dr. John, Albert King, the Good Rats, Moxy and Alphonse Mouzon, and was busy working on his first solo album, &quot;Teaser&quot;, when he accepted the invitation to join Deep Purple.

The resulting album from Deep Purple Mark IV, &quot;Come Taste the Band&quot;, was released in October 1975, one month before Bolin&#x27;s &quot;Teaser&quot; album. Despite mixed reviews and middling sales (#19 in the UK and #43 in the US), the collection revitalised the band once again, bringing a new, extreme funk edge to their hard rock sound. Bolin&#x27;s influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Hughes and Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the album&#x27;s material. Despite Bolin&#x27;s talents, his personal problems with hard drugs began to surface. During the &quot;Come Taste the Band&quot; tour many fans openly booed Bolin&#x27;s inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that Bolin was physically hampered by his addiction. At this same time, as he admitted in interviews years later, Hughes was suffering from cocaine addiction.

The last show on the tour was on 15 March 1976 at the Liverpool Empire Theatre. The break-up was finally made public in July 1976, with then-manager Rob Cooksey issuing a statement: &quot;the band will not record or perform together as Deep Purple again&quot;. Bolin went on to record his second solo album, &quot;Private Eyes&quot;. On 4 December 1976, after a show in Miami supporting Jeff Beck, Bolin was found unconscious by his girlfriend and bandmates. Unable to wake him, she hurriedly called paramedics, but it was too late. The official cause of death was multiple-drug intoxication. Bolin was 25 years old.

===Band split (1976–1984)===
After the break-up, most of the members of Deep Purple went on to have considerable success in a number of other bands, including Rainbow (1975–1984, Ritchie Blackmore and, from 1979, Roger Glover), Whitesnake (1978–present, David Coverdale, Jon Lord until 1984 and Ian Paice during 1979 to 1982) and Gillan (1978–1982, Ian Gillan). Ian Gillan also joined Black Sabbath from late 1982 to early 1984 (Glenn Hughes would also join Sabbath for a short time later in the 1980s). The now-defunct Deep Purple began to gain a type of mystical status, with fan-driven reissues and newly assembled live and compilation albums being released throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. This fuelled a number of promoter-led attempts to get the band to reform, especially with the revival of the hard rock market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1980, a touring version of the band surfaced with Rod Evans, who had left Captain Beyond at the end of 1973, as the only member who had ever been in Deep Purple, eventually ending in successful legal action from the legitimate Deep Purple camp over unauthorised use of the name. Evans was ordered to pay damages of US$672,000 for using the band name without permission.

===Mark II reunion (1984–1989): &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; and &quot;The House of Blue Light&quot;===

In April 1984, eight years after the demise of Deep Purple, a full-scale (and legal) reunion took place with the &quot;classic&quot; Mark II line-up of 1969–1973: Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan and Roger Glover. The reformed band signed a worldwide deal with PolyGram, with Mercury Records releasing their albums in the US, and Polydor Records in the UK and other countries. The album &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; was recorded in Vermont and released in October 1984. The album was commercially successful, reaching number 5 in the UK Albums Chart and number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US. The album included the singles and concert staples &quot;Knockin&#x27; At Your Back Door&quot; and &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; became the second Deep Purple album to go platinum in the US, following &quot;Machine Head&quot; (&quot;Made in Japan&quot; would also finally hit platinum status in the US in 1986, the same year &quot;Machine Head&quot; increased to double platinum).
The reunion tour followed, starting in Australia and winding its way across the world to North America, then into Europe by the following summer. Financially, the tour was also a tremendous success. In the US, the 1985 tour out-grossed every other artist except Bruce Springsteen. The UK homecoming saw the band headline the 1985 Knebworth Fayre in June, where the weather was bad (torrential rain and of mud) in front of 80,000 fans. The gig was called the &quot;Return of the Knebworth Fayre&quot;.

Mark II followed &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; with &quot;The House of Blue Light&quot; in 1987, which was supported by another world tour (interrupted after Blackmore broke a finger on stage while trying to catch his guitar after throwing it in the air). A new live album &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, which was culled from several shows on this tour, was released in 1988. In the UK a new Mark II version of &quot;Hush&quot; was also released in 1988 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Deep Purple.

=== Mark V (1989–1992): &quot;Slaves and Masters&quot; ===
Gillan was fired in 1989; his relations with Blackmore had again soured, and their musical differences had diverged too far. Originally, the band intended to recruit Survivor frontman Jimi Jamison as Gillan&#x27;s replacement. After two weeks of sessions with the band, however, Jamison announced he could not join Deep Purple owing to complications with Scotti Brothers Records, his record label. Eventually, after auditioning several high-profile candidates, including Brian Howe (White Spirit, Ted Nugent, Bad Company), Doug Pinnick (King&#x27;s X), Australians Jimmy Barnes (Cold Chisel) and John Farnham (Little River Band), Terry Brock (Strangeways, Giant) and Norman &quot;Kal&quot; Swan (Tytan, Lion, Bad Moon Rising), the band agreed on Joe Lynn Turner, who had previously been a member of Rainbow with Blackmore and Glover. This Mark V line-up recorded just one album, &quot;Slaves and Masters&quot; (1990), and undertook a world tour for most of 1991. The album achieved modest success, reaching number 45 in the UK and number 87 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, with some fans and critics feeling the music was closer in style to Rainbow than to Deep Purple.

=== Second Mark II reunion (1992–1993) and Mark VI (1993–1994): &quot;The Battle Rages On...&quot;===
With the tour complete, the band set to work on another album, the early sessions of which saw Turner being forced out. 1993 would be Deep Purple&#x27;s 25th anniversary year, with Lord, Paice and Glover (and the record company) wanting Gillan back for another Mark II reunion to celebrate this milestone. Although Blackmore preferred Turner to remain in the group, he grudgingly relented, after requesting and eventually receiving $250,000 in his bank account and Mark II completed the aptly titled &quot;The Battle Rages On...&quot; in 1993.

Blackmore still disagreed with the decision, creating more tension between himself and the rest of the band, especially Gillan. Of particular contention was that Gillan had reworked much of the material that had been written with Turner for the new album. Blackmore felt Gillan&#x27;s rewrites made the songs less melodic than they had been in their original versions. The band began a European tour, which was documented on the live album &quot;Come Hell or High Water&quot;, released in 1994. A live home video of the same name was also released, covering a show in Birmingham, England that displayed a very disgruntled Blackmore, who did not perform many of the guitar parts and at one point threw a cup of water at a cameraman for unknown reasons. The complete show was eventually released in 2006 as &quot;Live at the NEC&quot; but was quickly withdrawn after Gillan publicly complained, feeling it represented a bad time in the group&#x27;s history: &quot;It was one of the lowest points of my life – all of our lives, actually&quot;.

Blackmore left Deep Purple for the second and final time after a show in Helsinki, Finland in November 1993. Joe Satriani was drafted to complete the Japanese dates in December and stayed on for a European summer tour in 1994. He was asked to join permanently, but his commitments to his contract with Epic Records prevented this. The band unanimously chose Dixie Dregs/Kansas guitarist Steve Morse as Satriani&#x27;s successor in August 1994.
=== Mark VII (1994–2002): &quot;Purpendicular&quot; and &quot;Abandon&quot; ===
Morse&#x27;s arrival revitalised the band creatively, and in 1996 a new album titled &quot;Purpendicular&quot; was released, showing a wide variety of musical styles. Though in the post-grunge mid &#x27;90s it was no surprise that it never made chart success on the Billboard 200 in the U.S. This Mark VII line-up then released a new live album &quot;Live at The Olympia &#x27;96&quot; in 1997. With a revamped set list to tour, Deep Purple enjoyed successful tours throughout the rest of the 1990s, releasing the harder-sounding &quot;Abandon&quot; in 1998, and touring with renewed enthusiasm.
In 1999, Lord, with the help of a Dutch fan, who was also a musicologist and composer, Marco de Goeij, painstakingly recreated the &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot;, the original score having been lost. It was once again performed at the Royal Albert Hall in September 1999, this time with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Paul Mann. The concert also included songs from each member&#x27;s solo careers, as well as a short Deep Purple set, and the occasion was commemorated on the 2000 album &quot;In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra&quot;. 2001 saw the release of the box set &quot;The Soundboard Series&quot;, containing concerts from the 2001 Australian Tour plus two from Tokyo, Japan. Much of the next few years was spent on the road touring. The group continued forward until 2002 when founding member Lord (who, along with Paice, was the only member to be in all incarnations of the band) announced his amicable retirement from the band to pursue personal projects (especially orchestral work). Lord left his Hammond organ to his replacement, rock keyboard veteran Don Airey, who had helped Deep Purple out when Lord&#x27;s knee was injured in 2001. Airey had previously worked with Glover as a member of Rainbow from 1979 to 1982.

=== Mark VIII (2002–2022): &quot;Bananas&quot;, &quot;Rapture of the Deep&quot;, &quot;Now What?!&quot;, &quot;Infinite&quot;, &quot;Whoosh!&quot; and &quot;Turning to Crime&quot; ===
In 2003, the new Mark VIII line-up released &quot;Bananas&quot;, their first studio album in five years, and began touring in support. EMI Records refused a contract extension with Deep Purple, possibly because of lower than expected sales. Actually &quot;In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra&quot; sold more than &quot;Bananas&quot;.
The band played at the Live 8 concert in Park Place (Barrie, Ontario) in July 2005, and in October released their next album, &quot;Rapture of the Deep&quot;, which was followed by the Rapture of the Deep tour. Both &quot;Bananas&quot; and &quot;Rapture of the Deep&quot; were produced by Michael Bradford. In 2009 Ian Gillan said, &quot;Record sales have been steadily declining, but people are prepared to pay a lot for concert tickets.&quot; In addition, Gillan stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t think happiness comes with money.&quot;

Deep Purple did concert tours in 48 countries in 2011. The Songs That Built Rock Tour used a 38-piece orchestra, and included a performance at the O2 Arena in London. Until May 2011, the band members had disagreed about whether to make a new studio album, because it would not really make money any more. Roger Glover stated that Deep Purple should make a new studio album &quot;even if it costs us money.&quot; In early 2011, David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes told VH1 they would like to reunite Mark III for the right opportunity, such as a benefit concert. This however did not happen, as Ritchie Blackmore was difficult to contact and showed no interest, as he was busy with his current band Blackmore&#x27;s Night. The current band&#x27;s chief sound engineer on nine years of tours, Moray McMillin, died in September 2011, aged 57. After a lot of songwriting sessions in Europe, Deep Purple decided to record through the summer of 2012, and the band announced they would release their new studio album in 2013. Steve Morse announced to French magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot; that the new studio album would be produced by Bob Ezrin.
On 16 July 2012 the band&#x27;s co-founding member and former organ player, Jon Lord, died in London, aged 71. In December 2012 Roger Glover stated that the band had completed work on 14 songs for a new studio album, with 11 or 12 tracks set to appear on the final album to be released in 2013. On 26 February 2013 the title of the band&#x27;s nineteenth studio album was announced as &quot;Now What?!&quot;, which was recorded and mixed in Nashville, Tennessee, and released on 26 April 2013. The album contains the track &quot;Vincent Price&quot;, named after the horror actor who had worked with both Gillan and Glover earlier in their careers.
On 25 November 2016, Deep Purple announced &quot;Infinite&quot; as the title of their twentieth studio album, which was released on 7 April 2017. In support for the album, Deep Purple embarked on 13 May 2017 in Bucharest, Romania on The Long Goodbye Tour. At the time of the tour&#x27;s announcement in December 2016, Paice told the Heavyworlds website it &quot;may be the last big tour&quot;, adding that the band &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot;. He described the tour as being long in duration and said: &quot;We haven&#x27;t made any hard, fast plans, but it becomes obvious that you cannot tour the same way you did when you were 21. It becomes more and more difficult. People have other things in their lives, which take time. But never say never.&quot; On 3 February 2017, Deep Purple released a video version of &quot;Time for Bedlam&quot;, the first track taken from the new album and the first new Deep Purple track for almost four years.

On 29 February 2020, a new track, &quot;Throw My Bones&quot; was released online, with a new album &quot;Whoosh!&quot; planned for release in June. The release of the full-length album would later be postponed to 7 August 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A review in &quot;NME&quot; said the album sounded nothing like contemporary music of 2020, but suggested that &quot;maybe that&#x27;s a good thing&quot;. Gillan confirmed in an interview on 4 August 2020 that he and the other members of Deep Purple have no immediate plans to retire.

On 6 October 2021, the band had announced the title of their covers album, &quot;Turning to Crime&quot; which was released on 26 November 2021.

===Mark IX (2022–present): &quot;=1&quot;===

In March 2022, Morse announced that he had to take a hiatus from the band after his wife was diagnosed with cancer. The band, who had recently returned to live performances, continued touring with Simon McBride, formerly of Sweet Savage, standing in for Morse who at that point officially remained in the band. On 23 July 2022, it was announced that Morse would be leaving permanently in order to focus on caring for his wife as she battled cancer. Later that September, McBride was made an official member of the band.
In June 2022, Gillan announced that the band plans to work on their twenty-third studio album after the conclusion of the &quot;Whoosh!&quot; tour: &quot;Deep Purple has got a writing session booked in March 2023, which I believe is to get started on thinking about our next record.&quot;

Titled &quot;=1 More Time&quot;, a 2024 tour was announced on 19 March of that year. Jefferson Starship will be special guests on the Europe dates, and Reef will be special guests for the UK shows. A new studio album - the band&#x27;s twenty-third one and the first with McBride - was released in July 2024. On 24 April 2024 were revealed its title, &quot;=1&quot;, and track listing, and the release date stated as 20 July of that year. It is the fifth Deep Purple album Bob Ezrin has produced. The single &quot;Portable Door&quot; was released on 30 April. A second single, &quot;Pictures of You&quot;, was released on 5 June 2024. A third single, &quot;Lazy Sod&quot; was released on 5 July 2024.

==Legacy and influence==

Deep Purple are cited as one of the pioneers of hard rock and heavy metal, along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. The BBC states they &quot;made up the &#x27;unholy trinity&#x27; of British hard rock and heavy metal during the genre&#x27;s 1970s golden age.&quot; The group have influenced a number of rock and metal bands including Metallica, Judas Priest, Queen, Aerosmith, Van Halen, Alice in Chains, Pantera, Bon Jovi, Europe, Rush, Motörhead, and many new wave of British heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, and Def Leppard. Iron Maiden&#x27;s bassist and primary songwriter, Steve Harris, states that his band&#x27;s &quot;heaviness&quot; was inspired by &quot;Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.&quot; Van Halen founder Eddie Van Halen named &quot;Burn&quot; one of his favourite ever guitar riffs. Queen guitarist Brian May referred to Ritchie Blackmore as &quot;a trail blazer and technically incredible — unpredictable in every possible way...you never knew what you were gonna see when you went to see Purple&quot;. Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich states, &quot;When I was nine years old it was all about Deep Purple. My all time favourite [album] is still &quot;Made in Japan&quot;&quot;. The band&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Stormbringer&quot; was the first record owned by Till Lindemann, vocalist of German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein.

While firmly placed in the hard rock and heavy metal categories, Deep Purple&#x27;s music frequently incorporated elements of progressive rock and blues rock, prompting Canadian journalist Martin Popoff to once call the band &quot;a reference point of a genre in metal without categorisation.&quot; Jason Ankeny of AllMusic said the band &quot;made hard rock a fine art, and unleashed some of the greatest guitar riffs known to the world.&quot;

In 2000, Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; programme. At the 2008 World Music Awards, the band received the Legend Award. In 2011, they received the Innovator Award at the 2011 &quot;Classic Rock&quot; Awards in London. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll in 2012 ranked &quot;Made in Japan&quot; the sixth best live album of all time. As part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of &quot;Machine Head&quot; (1972), &quot;Re-Machined: A Tribute to Deep Purple&#x27;s Machine Head&quot; was released in 2012. This tribute album included Iron Maiden, Metallica, Steve Vai, Carlos Santana, The Flaming Lips, Black Label Society, Papa Roach vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, Chickenfoot (former Van Halen members Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony, guitarist Joe Satriani and Chad Smith of Red Hot Chili Peppers) and the supergroup Kings of Chaos (Def Leppard vocalist Joe Elliott, Steve Stevens, and former Guns N&#x27; Roses members Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum).

In 2007, Deep Purple were one of the featured artists in the fourth episode of the BBC/VH1 series &quot;Seven Ages of Rock&quot; – an episode focusing on heavy metal. In May 2019 the group received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.

=== Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ===
Before October 2012, Deep Purple had never been nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (though they have been eligible since 1993), but were nominated for induction in 2012 and 2013. Despite ranking second in the public&#x27;s vote on the Rock Hall fans&#x27; ballot, which had over half a million votes, they were not inducted by the Rock Hall committee. Kiss bassist Gene Simmons and Rush bassist Geddy Lee commented that Deep Purple should obviously be among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees. There have been criticisms in the past over Deep Purple not having been inducted. Toto guitarist Steve Lukather commented, &quot;they put Patti Smith in there but not Deep Purple? What&#x27;s the first song every kid learns how to play? [&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;] ... And they&#x27;re not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? ... the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has lost its cool because of the glaring omissions.&quot; Guns N&#x27; Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash expressed his surprise and disagreement regarding the non-induction of Deep Purple: &quot;The list of people who haven&#x27;t even been nominated is mind-boggling ... [the] big one for me is Deep Purple. How could you not induct Deep Purple?&quot;. Metallica band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett have also lobbied for the band&#x27;s induction. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in April 2014, Ulrich pleaded: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to get into the politics or all that stuff, but I got two words to say: &#x27;Deep Purple&#x27;. That&#x27;s all I have to say: Deep Purple. Seriously, people, Deep Purple. Two simple words in the English language ... &#x27;Deep Purple&#x27;! Did I say that already?&quot; In 2015, Chris Jericho, professional wrestler and vocalist of rock band Fozzy, stated: &quot;that Deep Purple are not in it [Hall of Fame]. It&#x27;s bullshit. Obviously there&#x27;s some politics against them from getting in there.&quot;

In response to these, a Hall of Fame chief executive said, &quot;The definition of &#x27;rock and roll&#x27; means different things to different people, but as broad as the classifications may be, they all share a common love of the music.&quot; Roger Glover got an inside word in there and they were talking of us as not &quot;fashionable&quot; enough. &quot;One of the jurors said, &#x27;You know, Deep Purple, they&#x27;re just one-hit wonders.&#x27; How can you deal with that kind of Philistinism, you know?&quot;. Ian Gillan also commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve fought all my life against being institutionalised and I think you have to actively search these things out, in other words mingle with the right people, and we don&#x27;t get invited to those kind of things.&quot; On 16 October 2013 Deep Purple were again announced as nominees for inclusion to the Hall, and once again they were not inducted.

In April 2015, Deep Purple topped the list in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers poll of acts that should be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2016. In October 2015, the band were nominated for induction for the third time. In December 2015, the band were announced as 2016 inductees into the Hall of Fame, with the Hall stating: &quot;Deep Purple&#x27;s non-inclusion in the Hall is a gaping hole which must now be filled&quot;, adding that along with fellow inductees Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, the band make up &quot;the Holy Trinity of hard rock and metal bands.&quot; The band was officially inducted on 8 April 2016. The Hall of Fame announced that the following members were included as inductees: Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Ritchie Blackmore, Roger Glover, Ian Gillan, Rod Evans, David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes. Excluded from induction were Nick Simper, Tommy Bolin, Joe Lynn Turner, Joe Satriani, Steve Morse and Don Airey.

It was reported that Ian Gillan announced that he was barring Hughes, Coverdale, Evans and Blackmore from playing with them onstage, as these members are not in the current &quot;living, breathing&quot; version of the band. When interviewed by Loudwire he stated however that this was not the case. An email was sent from his management to Blackmore&#x27;s management but Blackmore claimed he never received said email. Of the seven living inducted members, five showed up. Blackmore did not attend; a posting on his Facebook page claimed he was honoured by the induction and had considered attending, until he received correspondence from Bruce Payne, manager from the current touring version of Deep Purple saying, &quot;No!&quot; Evans, who had disappeared from the music scene more than three decades prior, also did not appear. Since Lord had died in 2012, his wife Vickie accepted his award on his behalf. The current members of the band played &quot;Highway Star&quot; for the opening performance. After a brief interlude playing the Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s song &quot;Green Onions&quot; while photos of the late Jon Lord flashed on the screen behind them, the current Deep Purple members played two more songs: &quot;Hush&quot; and their signature tune &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. Although barred from playing with Deep Purple, both David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes (as well as Roger Glover) joined fellow inductees Cheap Trick and an all-star cast to perform a cover of the Fats Domino song &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;.

==Concert tours==

Deep Purple are considered to be one of the hardest touring bands in the world. They have toured the world since 1968 (with the exception of their 1976–1984 split). In 2007, the band received a special award for selling more than 150,000 tickets in France, with 40 dates in the country in 2007 alone. Also in 2007, Deep Purple&#x27;s Rapture of the Deep tour was voted number 6 concert tour of the year (in all music genres) by Planet Rock listeners. The Rolling Stones&#x27; A Bigger Bang tour was voted number 5 and beat Purple&#x27;s tour by only 1%. Deep Purple released a new live compilation DVD box, Around the World Live, in May 2008. In February 2008, the band made their first-ever appearance at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow, Russia at the personal request of Dmitry Medvedev who at the time was a chairman of the state owned Gazprom company, which sponsored the concert, and who was considered a shoo-in for the seat of the Presidency of Russia. Prior to that, Deep Purple has toured Russia several times starting as early as 1996 but has not been considered to have played such a significant venue previously. The band was part of the entertainment for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 in Liberec, the Czech Republic.

<text>Democracy movements of the People&#x27;s Republic of China are a series of organized political movements, inside and outside of the country, addressing a variety of grievances, including objections to socialist bureaucratism and objections to the continuation of the one-party rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) itself. The Democracy Wall movement of November 1978 to spring 1981 is typically regarded as the beginning of contemporary Chinese democracy movement. In addition to the Democracy Wall movement, the events of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre are among the notable examples of Chinese democracy movements.

==History==
=== Origin ===
The beginning of China&#x27;s democracy movements is usually regarded as the Democracy Wall movement of November 1978 to spring 1981. The Democracy Wall movement framed the key issue as the elimination of bureaucratism and the bureaucratic class. Former Red Guards from both rebel and conservative factions were the core of the movement. Democracy Wall participants agreed that &quot;democracy&quot; was the means to resolve the conflict between the bureaucratic class and the people, the nature of the proposed democratic institutions was a major source of disagreement. A majority of participants in the movement favored viewed the movement as part of a struggle between correct and incorrect notions of Marxism. Many participants advocated classical Marxist views that drew on the Paris Commune for inspiration. The Democracy Wall movement also included non-Marxists and anti-Marxists, although these participants were a minority. Demands for &quot;democracy&quot; were frequent but without an agreed-upon meaning. Participants in the movement variously associated the concept of democracy with socialism, communism, liberal democracy, capitalism, and Christianity. They drew on a diverse range of intellectual resources &quot;ranging from classical Marxist and socialist traditions to Enlightenment philosophers, [socialist] experiments in Yugoslavia, and Western liberal democracy.&quot; 

Significant documents of the Democracy Wall Movement include The Fifth Modernization manifesto by Wei Jingsheng, who was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for authoring the document. In it, Wei argued that political liberalization and the empowerment of the laboring masses was essential for modernization, that the CCP was controlled by reactionaries and that the people must struggle to overthrow the reactionaries via a long and possibly bloody fight.

=== Development ===
Throughout the 1980s, these ideas increased in popularity among college-educated Chinese, through the &quot;New Enlightenment movement&quot; led by intellectuals. In response to growing corruption, economic dislocation and the sense that reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were leaving China behind, the Tiananmen Square protests erupted in 1989, the second massive student movement after the 1986 student protests. In 1989, these protests were violently suppressed by government troops on June 4, 1989. In response, a number of pro-democracy organizations were formed by overseas Chinese student activists, and there was considerable sympathy for the movement among Westerners, who formed the China Support Network (CSN).

==Government&#x27;s response==

Ideologically, the government&#x27;s first reaction to the democracy movement was an effort to focus on the personal behavior of individual dissidents and argue that they were tools of foreign powers. In the mid-1990s, the government began using more effective arguments which were influenced by Chinese Neo-Conservatism and Western authors such as Edmund Burke. The main argument was that China&#x27;s main priority was economic growth, and economic growth required political stability. The democracy movement was flawed because it promoted radicalism and revolution which put the gains that China had made into jeopardy. In contrast to Wei&#x27;s argument that democracy was essential to economic growth, the government argued that economic growth must come before political liberalization, comparable to what happened in the Four Asian Tigers.

With regard to political dissent engendered by the movement, the government has taken a three-pronged approach. First, dissidents who are widely known in the West such as Wei Jingsheng, Fang Lizhi, and Wang Dan are deported. Although Chinese criminal law does not contain any provisions for exiling citizens, these deportations are conducted by giving the dissident a severe jail sentence and then granting medical parole. Second, the less well-known leaders of a dissident movement are identified and given severe jail sentences. Generally, the government targets a relatively small number of organizers who are crucial in coordinating a movement and who are then charged with endangering state security or revealing official secrets. Thirdly, the government attempts to address the grievances of possible supporters of the movement. This is intended to isolate the leadership of the movement, and prevent disconnected protests from combining into a general organized protest that can threaten the CCP&#x27;s hold on power.

===Chinese socialist democracy===
CCP leaders assert there are already elements of democracy; they dubbed the term &quot;Chinese socialist democracy&quot; for what they describe as a participatory representative government.

== Academic interpretations ==
Academic Lin Chun criticizes the phrase &quot;democracy movement&quot; as typically used in the scholarly and media discourse on China, noting that the term is often used exclusively to refer to the &quot;demands and activism of an urban, educated group of people seeking liberal more than democratic values.&quot; She notes, for example, that the political turbulence in universities over the period 1986 to 1989 had specific flash points ranging from anger at the government&#x27;s &quot;too soft&quot; position on China–Japan relations to poor management of student welfare.

<doc id="45851" wikidata="Q18557" url="?curid=45851" title="Opeth">
<text>Opeth is a Swedish progressive metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1990. The band incorporates folk, blues, classical, and jazz elements into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Songs may include acoustic guitar passages, Mellotrons, death growls, and strong dynamic shifts. 

The group have been through several personnel changes since early in their history, including the replacement of every original member. Lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt has been Opeth&#x27;s driving force since the departure of founder and lead vocalist David Isberg in 1992. The band rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums, but since their first world tour in support of the 2001 album &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, they have performed several other major world tours. 

Opeth have released fourteen studio albums, four live DVDs, four live albums (three that are in conjunction with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album &quot;Orchid&quot; in 1995. With their eighth studio album, &quot;Ghost Reveries&quot; (2005), the band achieved chart success in several dozen countries, including Top Ten in Sweden. Their ninth studio album, &quot;Watershed&quot; (2008), topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release, and reached 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. As of November 2009, the band have sold over 1.5 million copies of their albums and DVDs worldwide, including 300,000 collective SoundScans of their albums &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, &quot;Damnation&quot;, and &quot;Deliverance&quot; in the United States.

==History==
===Formation (1990–1993)===
Opeth was formed as a death metal band in April 1990 in Stockholm, Sweden, by David Isberg, with some friends from Täby; Isberg was the lead vocalist. The band name was taken from the Wilbur Smith novel &quot;The Sunbird&quot;, in which Opet is the name of a fictional city. Isberg asked former Eruption band member and guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt to join Opeth as a bassist, replacing Martin Persson. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band&#x27;s current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. At this time Opeth declared themselves to be the &quot;most evil band in the world&quot;.

Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth&#x27;s slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt&#x27;s friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band&#x27;s next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with Stefan Guteklint taking over the role of bassist. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing &quot;creative differences&quot;.

Following Isberg&#x27;s departure, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with Candlelight Records in 1994. Opeth initially employed former member De Farfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings, and he went on to join on a full-time basis following the release of Opeth&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Orchid&quot;, in 1995.

===&quot;Orchid&quot;, &quot;Morningrise&quot;, and &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; (1994–1998)===
Opeth recorded its debut album, &quot;Orchid&quot;, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until 15 May 1995, and only in Europe. &quot;Orchid&quot; tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.

After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album, titled &quot;Morningrise&quot;, was released in Europe on 24 June 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth&#x27;s longest song, the 20-minute &quot;Black Rose Immortal&quot;. Opeth toured the UK in support of &quot;Morningrise&quot;, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.

In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former &quot;Eternal&quot; members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn&#x27;t be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot;, which was included on the album &quot;A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden&quot;.

With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997. Although Opeth had Méndez, due to time constraints Åkerfeldt played bass on the album. &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot; was released to critical acclaim on 18 August 1998.

===&quot;Still Life&quot; and &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; (1999–2001)===
In 1999, the ownership of Candlelight Records changed hands, as owner and friend of the band Lee Barrett left the company. Opeth signed with UK label Peaceville Records in Europe, which was distributed by Music For Nations. Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated. Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio. Delays with the album&#x27;s artwork pushed the release back an additional month and &quot;Still Life&quot; was released on 18 October 1999. Due to problems with the band&#x27;s new distribution network, the album was not released in the United States until February 2001. &quot;Still Life&quot; was the first album recorded with Méndez, and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release, including the band&#x27;s logo. Allmusic called &quot;Still Life&quot; a &quot;formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies.&quot; As explained by Åkerfeldt, &quot;Still Life&quot; is a concept album: &quot;The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn&#x27;t got the same faith as the rest of the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old &#x27;babe.&#x27; The big bosses of the town know that he&#x27;s back... A lot of bad things start happening.&quot;

Following a few live dates in Europe, Opeth returned to Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, with Porcupine Tree&#x27;s Steven Wilson producing. The band sought to recreate the recording experience of &quot;Still Life&quot;, and again entered the studio with minimal rehearsals, and no lyrics written. &quot;This time it was tough,&quot; Åkerfeldt said, &quot;I feel pleasantly blown away by the immense result, though. It was indeed worth the effort.&quot; Wilson also pushed the band to expand its sound, incorporating new sounds and production techniques. &quot;Steve guided us into the realms of &#x27;strange&#x27; noises for guitars and voice&quot;, Åkerfeldt said.

Opeth released its fifth studio album, &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, on 21 February 2001. AllMusic has stated that the album &quot;keeps with Opeth&#x27;s tradition by transcending the limits of death/black metal and repeatedly shattering the foundations of conventional songwriting&quot;. In support of &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, Opeth embarked on its first world tour, headlined Europe for the first time, and made an appearance at the 2001 Wacken Open Air festival in Germany, playing to a crowd of 60,000.

===&quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Damnation&quot; (2002–2004)===
Opeth returned to Sweden after touring in support of &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, and began writing for the next album. At first, Åkerfeldt had trouble putting together new material: &quot;I wanted to write something heavier than we&#x27;d ever done, still I had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn&#x27;t want to go to waste.&quot; Jonas Renkse of Katatonia, a long-time friend of Åkerfeldt, suggested writing music for two separate albums—one heavy and one soft.

Excited at the prospect, Åkerfeldt agreed without consulting his bandmates or record label. While his bandmates liked the idea of recording two separate albums, Åkerfeldt had to convince the label: &quot;I had to lie somewhat ... saying that we could do this recording very soon, it won&#x27;t cost more than a regular single album.&quot; With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering Nacksving Studios in 2002, and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously, Åkerfeldt said the recording process was &quot;the toughest test of our history.&quot; After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios. &quot;&quot;Deliverance&quot; was so poorly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever,&quot; Åkerfeldt claimed, that Sneap &quot;is credited as a &#x27;saviour&#x27; in the sleeve, as he surely saved much of the recording.&quot;

&quot;Deliverance&quot; was released on 4 November 2002, and debuted at number 19 on the US Top Independent Albums chart, marking the band&#x27;s first US chart appearance. AllMusic stated, &quot;&quot;Deliverance&quot; is altogether more subtle than any of its predecessors, approaching listeners with haunting nuances and masterful dynamics rather than overwhelming them with sheer mass and complexity.&quot;

Opeth performed a one-off concert in Stockholm, then returned to the UK to finish recording vocals for the second of the two albums, &quot;Damnation&quot;, at Steven Wilson&#x27;s No Man&#x27;s Land Studios. Although Åkerfeldt believed the band could not finish both albums, Opeth completed &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Damnation&quot; in just seven weeks of studio time, which was the same amount spent on &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; alone. &quot;Damnation&quot; was released on 14 April 2003, and garnered the band its first appearance on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 192. The album also won the 2003 Swedish Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. On 1 January 2016, Opeth re-released both &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Damnation&quot; in one package, containing CD and DVD versions, along with new mixing.

The band embarked on its biggest tour yet, playing nearly 200 shows in 2003 and 2004. Opeth performed three special shows in Europe with two song lists each—one acoustic set and one heavy set. The band recorded its first DVD, &quot;Lamentations (Live at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire 2003)&quot;, at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London, England. The DVD features a two-hour performance, including the entire &quot;Damnation&quot; album, several songs from &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, and a one-hour documentary about the recording of &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Damnation&quot;. &quot;Lamentations&quot; was certified Gold (over 50,000 sales) by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.

Opeth was scheduled to perform in Jordan without a crew due to the fear of terrorist attacks in the Middle East. Opeth&#x27;s tour manager distributed 6,000 tickets for the concert, but before the band left for Jordan, drummer Lopez called Åkerfeldt stating he was having an anxiety attack and could not perform, forcing the band to cancel the show. In early 2004, Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour. Opeth decided against cancelling the remainder of the tour, with Lopez&#x27;s drum technician filling in for two concerts. Lopez promised that he would return to the tour as soon as he could, but two shows later Opeth asked Strapping Young Lad drummer Gene Hoglan to fill in. Lopez returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Damnation&quot; tour.

===&quot;Ghost Reveries&quot; (2005–2007)===
Opeth returned home in 2004 to start writing new material for its eighth album; by the end of the year, they had finished writing it. European label, Music For Nations, closed its doors in 2005, and after negotiations with various labels, the band signed with Roadrunner Records. Åkerfeldt said the primary reason for signing with Roadrunner was the label&#x27;s wide distribution, ensuring the album would be available at larger-chain retailers. When news leaked that the band was signed to Roadrunner, who predominantly worked with trend-oriented rock and metal, some fans accused the band of selling out. &quot;To be honest,&quot; Åkerfeldt said, &quot;that&#x27;s such an insult after 15 years as a band and 8 records. I can&#x27;t believe we haven&#x27;t earned each and every Opeth fan&#x27;s credibility after all these years. I mean, our songs are 10 minutes long!&quot; The band rehearsed for three weeks before entering the studio, the first time the band rehearsed since the 1998 album, &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot;. During rehearsal, keyboardist Wiberg joined Opeth as a full-time member after touring with the band on keyboards for more than a year. Opeth recorded at Fascination Street Studios in Örebro, Sweden, from 18 March to 1 June 2005, and released the resulting &quot;Ghost Reveries&quot; on 30 August 2005, to critical acclaim and commercial success. The album debuted at number 64 in the US, and number nine in Sweden, higher than any previous Opeth release. Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net gave the album ten out of ten, one of only 21 albums to achieve a perfect rating from the site. Rod Smith of &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine called &quot;Ghost Reveries&quot; &quot;achingly beautiful, sometimes unabashedly brutal, often a combination of both&quot;.

On 12 May 2006, Martin Lopez announced that he had officially parted ways with Opeth due to health problems, and was replaced by Martin Axenrot. Opeth toured on the main stage of Gigantour in 2006, alongside Megadeth. &quot;Ghost Reveries&quot; was re-released on 31 October 2006, with a bonus cover song (Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;), a DVD featuring a 5.1 surround sound mix of the album and a documentary on the making of the record. A recording of Opeth&#x27;s live performance at the Camden Roundhouse, in London, on 9 November 2006, was released as the double live album &quot;The Roundhouse Tapes&quot;, which topped the Finnish DVD chart.

On 17 May 2007, Peter Lindgren announced he would be leaving Opeth after 16 years. &quot;The decision has been the toughest I&#x27;ve ever made but it is the right one to make at this point in my life,&quot; Lindgren said. &quot;I feel that I simply have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry.&quot; Ex-Arch Enemy guitarist Fredrik Åkesson replaced Lindgren, as Åkerfeldt explained &quot;Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter. In my opinion he&#x27;s one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden. We all get along great as we&#x27;ve known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus-like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth.&quot;

===&quot;Watershed&quot; and &quot;In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; (2008–2010)===

Opeth entered Fascination Street Studios in November 2007 to record their ninth studio album, with Åkerfeldt producing. By January 2008, Opeth had recorded 13 songs, including three cover songs. The finished album, &quot;Watershed&quot;, features seven tracks, with cover songs used as bonus tracks on different versions of the album. &quot;Watershed&quot; was released on 3 June 2008. Åkerfeldt described the songs on the album as &quot;a bit more energetic&quot;. Opeth toured in support of &quot;Watershed&quot;, including headlining the UK Defenders of the Faith tour with Arch Enemy, an appearance at Wacken Open Air, and the Progressive Nation tour with headliner Dream Theater. &quot;Watershed&quot; was Opeth&#x27;s highest-charting album to date, debuting at number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, on the Australian ARIA album charts at number seven and at number one on Finland&#x27;s official album chart. Opeth went on a worldwide tour in support of &quot;Watershed&quot;. In 2008, they played the UK Bloodstock festival alongside Dimmu Borgir. From September to October, the band toured North America backed by High on Fire, Baroness, and Nachtmystium. They returned to tour Europe for the rest of the year with Cynic and The Ocean.

In 2010, Opeth wrote and recorded the new track, &quot;The Throat of Winter&quot;, which appeared on the digital EP soundtrack of the video game, &quot;God of War III&quot;. Åkerfeldt described the song as &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;not very metal.&quot; To celebrate their 20th anniversary, Opeth performed a six-show, worldwide tour called &quot;Evolution XX: An Opeth Anthology&quot;, from 30 March through 9 April 2010. &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; was performed in its entirety, along with several songs never before performed. The concert of 5 April 2010, at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England was filmed for a DVD and live album package titled &quot;In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;. The set was released on 21 September 2010, in 2-DVD and 2-DVD/3-CD configurations. For the DVD the concert was split into two sets. The first set consists of the entire &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; album, while the second set contains one song from every album excluding &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, in chronological order representing the twenty years of &quot;evolution&quot; in their music. Åkerfeldt stated, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe it, but, fuck, we&#x27;re celebrating 20 years. I&#x27;ve been in this band ever since I was 16. It&#x27;s insane.&quot; A special edition of &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; was released in March 2010 to coincide with the tour.

===&quot;Heritage&quot; (2011–2013)===


In September 2010, Mikael Åkerfeldt stated that he was writing for a new Opeth album. The band announced on their website that they would start recording their tenth album on 31 January 2011, at the Atlantis/Metronome studios in Stockholm, once again with Jens Bogren (engineering) and Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree as co-producer. Shortly after mixing was complete on the new album in April 2011, Per Wiberg left the band. Åkerfeldt said the band, &quot;came to the decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this came as no surprise to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you could say it was a mutual decision. There&#x27;s no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that&#x27;s that.&quot;

Opeth&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;Heritage&quot;, was released on 14 September 2011, to generally favorable reviews. The album sold 19,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at number 19 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart. &quot;Heritage&quot; debuted at number four in the band&#x27;s native country of Sweden. &quot;Heritage&quot; became the second Opeth album to not feature any death growls and had a much more progressive style than their previous albums, a direction that Åkerfeldt was already interested in pursuing with Opeth.

The first two songs Åkerfeldt wrote for &quot;Heritage&quot; were in the style of &quot;Watershed&quot;. After hearing the songs for the first time, Martín Méndez told Åkerfeldt that he would be disappointed if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for &quot;Heritage&quot;, Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old. In a review for Allmusic, Thom Jurek called &quot;Heritage&quot; the band&#x27;s most adventurous album, describing the songs as &quot;drenched in instrumental interludes, knotty key and chord changes, shifting time signatures, clean vocals, and a keyboard-heavy instrumentation that includes Mellotrons, Rhodes pianos, and Hammond organs&quot;.

Opeth supported &quot;Heritage&quot; with a tour that would last for over 200 tour dates. The tour was the band&#x27;s first with new keyboardist, Joakim Svalberg, who played on the opening track of the album. During the tour, Opeth played with bands such as Katatonia, Pain of Salvation, Mastodon, Ghost and Anathema all over the world in countries such as the United States, Europe, Turkey, India, Japan, Greece, Israel, Latin America and Sweden. The tour concluded with &quot;Melloboat 2013&quot;.

===&quot;Pale Communion&quot; (2014–2015)===
On 26 August 2014, Opeth released its eleventh studio album, titled &quot;Pale Communion&quot;. Åkerfeldt began working on new material as far back as August 2012. In January 2014 he stated, &quot;We&#x27;ve been looking at [tracking the next album at] Rockfield Studios in Wales where Queen recorded &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, but we haven&#x27;t made a decision yet, but it will be an expensive album. There&#x27;s a lot going on, lots of string arrangements that we haven&#x27;t had in the past.&quot; Despite fearing that the band&#x27;s new musical direction would split Opeth&#x27;s fanbase, when asked if it will it be heavier or softer than &quot;Heritage&quot;, Åkerfeldt said, &quot;Maybe a little bit heavier, not death metal heavy, but hard rock/heavy metal heavy. There&#x27;s also lots of progressive elements and acoustic guitars, but also more sinister-sounding riffs.&quot; Åkerfeldt also produced the new album which will include string instrumentation, something that he became interested in doing when working on &quot;Storm Corrosion&quot;. The band members in Opeth felt rejuvenated after creating &quot;Heritage&quot; which resulted in closer relationships between them.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewed &quot;Pale Communion&quot; positively, calling it &quot;strange, intricate prog-metal genius&quot; somewhat flawed by Åkerfeldt&#x27;s indulgent vocal styling. The album saw Opeth&#x27;s highest chart positions in the history of the band with &quot;Pale Communion&quot; debuting at number 19 in the US, number 3 in Sweden, and number 14 in the United Kingdom. It sold 13,000 copies in its first week of release in the US.

&quot;Pale Communion&quot; was supported with more touring from Opeth. In 2015, Opeth played several concerts to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band. At these special shows, the band was doing two sets. The first set is 2005&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Reveries&quot; as a ten-year anniversary celebration of the album. The second set spanned the rest of the band&#x27;s career, celebrating their 25th anniversary. Åkerfeldt expressed excitement for the concerts.

===&quot;Sorceress&quot;, &quot;Garden of the Titans&quot; and &quot;In Cauda Venenum&quot; (2016–2020)===
On 15 June 2016, Nuclear Blast Entertainment announced the signing of Opeth. Three days later, on 18 June, Opeth released a 30-second teaser for their new album, &quot;Sorceress&quot;. A month later, on 18 July, the band confirmed the album would be released on 30 September, in addition to revealing the artwork and track list. Mikael Åkerfeldt described it as, &quot;A fine little record. My favorite in our discography right now. Of course. That&#x27;s how it should be, right? It&#x27;s both fresh and old, both progressive and rehashed. Heavy and calm. Just the way we like it.&quot; The album was the first project under Moderbolaget Records, a joint venture between Opeth and Nuclear Blast. Moderbolaget means &quot;the parent company&quot; in Swedish.

On 25 July 2016, in the build up towards the album release, the band posted the first Sorceress: Studio Report on their YouTube channel. In the behind-the-scenes studio tour, it is confirmed that the band had returned to Rockfield Studios where they previously recorded &quot;Pale Communion&quot;. At the end of the video, there is a 20-second excerpt of a track believed to be from the album featuring heavily down-tuned guitars. On 1 August 2016, the band released a lyric video for the title-track &#x27;Sorceress&#x27; on their YouTube channel. On 5 September 2016, Opeth released a lyric video for the second single titled &#x27;Will O the Wisp,&#x27; again through their YouTube channel and website Opeth&#x27;s video for &quot;Era&quot; was nominated for &quot;Video of the Year&quot; at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards, where they ultimately won &quot;International Band of the Year&quot;.

On 2 October 2017, Åkerfeldt said he has been thinking about doing something &quot;twisted&quot; and different for the next studio album, which could be released by mid-to-late 2019. On 20 November 2017, guitarist Fredrik Åkesson stated that the band will not have any gigs in the upcoming months, until the 2018 summer festivals. During this break the band will focus on writing songs for the new album. On 11 July 2018, during an interview with FaceCulture, Åkesson said &quot;I&#x27;ve recorded a lot of solos so far. And Mikael Åkerfeldt has almost already written 12 songs for the new album, so we have more material than enough for an album&quot;. On 22 May 2019, the band announced their thirteenth studio album, &quot;In Cauda Venenum&quot;, due for release on 27 September 2019. On 12 July 2019, Opeth released the first single from &quot;In Cauda Venenum&quot; entitled &quot;Heart in Hand&quot; in both English and Swedish.

===Lineup changes and &quot;The Last Will and Testament&quot; (2021–present) ===
On 16 November 2021, it was announced that longtime drummer Martin Axenrot had left the band due to conflict of interests and his refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and was replaced by Sami Karppinen for the North American tour. On 9 September 2022, it was announced Waltteri Väyrynen (formerly of Paradise Lost and Alexi Laiho&#x27;s project Bodom After Midnight) was the band&#x27;s new drummer.

On 1 August 2024, Opeth announced that their fourteenth studio album &quot;The Last Will and Testament&quot; would be released on 11 October, although the date was postponed to 22 November due to manufacturing delays. With the return of growl vocals after 16 years, last appearing on the album &quot;Watershed&quot;, the album received positive feedback from many fans and music critics. It was also the band&#x27;s first fully conceptual record since &quot;Still Life&quot; in 1999.

==Musical style and influences==
As Opeth&#x27;s primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth&#x27;s sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings &quot;Here Come the Tears&quot; from Judas Priest&#x27;s third album &quot;Sin After Sin&quot; (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.

Opeth&#x27;s distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth&#x27;s &quot;epic, progressive death metal style&quot;. Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth&#x27;s sound as incorporating &quot;the likes of folk, funk, blues, &#x27;70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.&quot; In his review of Opeth&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, &quot;Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.&quot; Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth&#x27;s music:

I don&#x27;t see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It&#x27;s impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We&#x27;re not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That&#x27;s what keeps us going.

More recently, Opeth have abandoned their death metal sound resulting in a mellower progressive rock sound. When talking about &quot;Heritage&quot;, guitarist Fredrik Åkesson stated:

In the beginning it took me a little while to get used to the new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn&#x27;t have continued if we hadn&#x27;t done &quot;Heritage&quot;. I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There&#x27;s always going to be some haters, but you can&#x27;t be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don&#x27;t think &quot;Heritage&quot; is metal but I think it&#x27;s metal to go somewhere people don&#x27;t expect. It doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re not embracing the past sound of Opeth.

Vocally, Åkerfeldt shifts between traditional death metal vocals for heavy sections, and clean, sometimes whispered or soft-spoken vocals over mellower passages. While his death growls were dominant on early releases, later efforts incorporate more clean vocals, with &quot;Damnation&quot;, &quot;Heritage&quot;, &quot;Pale Communion&quot;, &quot;Sorceress&quot; and &quot;In Cauda Venenum&quot; featuring only clean singing. Rivadavia noted that &quot;Åkerfeldt&#x27;s vocals run the gamut from bowel-churning grunts to melodies of chilling beauty—depending on each movement section&#x27;s mood.&quot;

==Legacy==
A number of artists and bands have cited Opeth as an influence, among which are Mayan (a project of Mark Jansen from Epica), Luc Lemay of Gorguts, Soen (a band of former Opeth drummer Martin Lopez), Tor Oddmund Suhrke of Leprous, Disillusion, Caligula&#x27;s Horse, Klimt 1918, Daniel Droste of Ahab, Becoming the Archetype, Nucleus Torn, Alex Vynogradoff of Kauan, Wastefall, Eric Guenther of The Contortionist, Thomas MacLean and To-Mera, The Man-Eating Tree, Nahemah, Vladimir Agafonkin of Obiymy Doshchu, Schizoid Lloyd, Native Construct, Maxime Côté of Catuvolcus, Bilocate, and Jinjer.

In addition, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for their work including Steven Wilson, Seven Lions, John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy, Ihsahn, Simone Simons of Epica, Oliver Palotai of Kamelot, Jim Matheos of Fates Warning, and Haken.

<text>Charles Ponzi (; ; born Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmo Tebaldo Ponzi; March 3, 1882 – January 18, 1949) was an Italian charlatan and con artist who operated in the United States and Canada. His aliases included &quot;Charles Ponci&quot;, &quot;Carlo&quot;, Benny Broncko and &quot;Charles P. Bianchi&quot;.

Born in Lugo, Italy, he became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the U.S. as a form of arbitrage. In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot;. His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his &quot;investors&quot; $20 million.

Ponzi may have been inspired by the scheme of William W. Miller (also known as &quot;520% Miller&quot;), a Brooklyn bookkeeper who in 1899 used a similar deception to take in $1 million (approximately $35 million in 2022).

== Early life ==
Charles Ponzi was born in Lugo, Emilia-Romagna, Kingdom of Italy on March 3, 1882. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot; he had come from a family in Parma. Ponzi&#x27;s ancestors had been well-to-do, and his mother continued to use the title &quot;donna&quot;, but the family had subsequently fallen upon difficult times and had little money. Ponzi took a job as a postal worker early on, but soon was accepted into the University of Rome La Sapienza. His richer friends considered the university a &quot;four-year vacation&quot;, and he was inclined to follow them around to bars, cafés, and the opera. This resulted in Ponzi spending all his money, and four years later he was broke and without a degree. During this time, a number of Italian boys were migrating to the U.S. and returning to Italy as wealthy individuals. Ponzi&#x27;s family encouraged him to do the same, with the intention of returning his family to its former socio-economic status.

== Arrival in the United States ==
On November 15, 1903, Ponzi arrived in Boston aboard the S.S. &quot;Vancouver&quot;. By his own account, Ponzi had $2.50 in his pocket (), having gambled away the rest of his life savings during the voyage. &quot;I landed in this country with $2.50 in cash and $1 million in hopes, and those hopes never left me,&quot; he later told a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He quickly learned English and spent the next few years doing odd jobs along the East Coast, eventually taking a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant, where he slept on the floor. Ponzi managed to work his way up to the position of waiter, but was fired for theft and shortchanging customers.

== Montreal and prison==
In 1907, after several years of failing to achieve success in the U.S., Ponzi moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and became an assistant teller in the newly opened Banco Zarossi, a bank located on Saint Jacques Street started by Luigi &quot;Louis&quot; Zarossi to service the influx of Italian immigrants arriving in the city. By this time, Ponzi had a winning personality and spoke English and French, as well as Italian, which Zuckoff says helped him get the job at the bank. While working there, Ponzi first saw the scheme of &quot;robbing Peter to pay Paul&quot;, which later would be called a Ponzi scheme. Zarossi paid 6 per cent interest on bank deposits—double the going rate at the time—and his bank was growing rapidly as a result. Ponzi eventually rose to the position of bank manager. However, he found out that the bank was in serious financial trouble, because of bad real estate loans, and that Zarossi was funding the high interest payments not through profit on investments, but by using money deposited in newly opened accounts. The bank eventually failed, and Zarossi fled to Mexico with a large portion of the money belonging to the bank&#x27;s customers.

Ponzi stayed in Montreal and, for some time, lived at Zarossi&#x27;s house, helping the man&#x27;s abandoned family while planning to return to the U.S. and start over. As Ponzi was penniless, this proved to be very difficult. Eventually, he walked into the offices of a former Zarossi customer, Canadian Warehousing, and finding no one there, wrote himself a check for $423.58 in a checkbook he found, forging the signature of Damien Fournier, a director of the company. Confronted by police who had taken note of his large expenditures just after the forged check was cashed, Ponzi held out his wrist and said, &quot;I&#x27;m guilty&quot;. He ended up spending three years as Inmate #6660 at St. Vincent-de-Paul Federal Penitentiary, a bleak facility located on the outskirts of Montreal. Rather than inform his mother of his imprisonment, he posted her a letter stating that he had found a job as a &quot;special assistant&quot; to a prison warden.
After his release in 1911, Ponzi decided to return to the U.S., but became involved in a scheme to smuggle Italian illegal immigrants across the border. He was caught and spent two years in Atlanta Prison. Here he became a translator for the warden, who was intercepting letters from mobster Ignazio &quot;the Wolf&quot; Lupo. Ponzi ended up befriending Lupo. Another prisoner, Charles W. Morse, became a true role model to Ponzi. Morse, a wealthy Wall Street businessman and speculator, fooled doctors during medical exams by eating soap shavings to give the appearance of ill-health. Morse was soon released from prison. Ponzi completed his prison term following Morse&#x27;s release, having an additional month added to his term due to his inability to pay a $50 fine.

== Work in a mining camp and in Boston ==
After Ponzi&#x27;s release from prison, he made his way back to Boston. While working at a mining camp as a nurse, he came up with the idea of going to another mining camp, starting a utility there that would supply water and power, and selling its stock. During this time, a fellow nurse called Pearl Gosid had suffered severe burns in an accident. Despite not knowing her, Ponzi volunteered for two major operations to donate of skin from his back and legs to Pearl. This resulted in pleurisy and similar complications, and Ponzi&#x27;s losing his job.

Thereafter Ponzi continued to travel around looking for work, and in Boston, he met Rose Maria Gnecco, a stenographer, to whom he proposed marriage. Gnecco came from a family of Italian-American immigrants who had a small fruit stall in downtown Boston. Though Ponzi did not tell Gnecco about his years in jail, his mother sent Gnecco a letter telling her of Ponzi&#x27;s past. Nonetheless, she married him in 1918. For the next few months, Ponzi worked at a number of businesses, including his father-in-law&#x27;s grocery, and the import-export company JR Poole before hitting upon an idea to sell advertising in a large business listing to be sent to various businesses. He was unable to sell this idea to businesses, and his company failed soon after. Ponzi took over his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s fledgling fruit company for a short time, but to no avail, and it, too, failed shortly thereafter.

== Origin of the term &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot; and IRC scheme ==
=== An idea to trade IRCs ===
Ponzi set up a small office at 27 School Street, Boston, in the summer of 1919 attempting to sell business ideas to contacts in Europe. He received a letter from a company in Spain asking about the advertising catalog which included an international reply coupon (IRC), leading Ponzi to find a weakness in the system which, at least in principle, gave him an opportunity to make money.

Postal reply coupons allowed a person in one country to pay for the postage of a reply to a correspondent in another country. IRCs were priced at the cost of postage in the country of purchase, but could be exchanged for stamps to cover the cost of postage in the country where redeemed; if these values were different, there was a potential profit. Inflation after World War I had greatly decreased the cost of postage in Italy expressed in U.S. dollars, so that an IRC could be bought cheaply in Italy and exchanged for U.S. stamps of higher value, which could then be sold. Ponzi claimed that the net profit on these transactions, after expenses and exchange rates, was in excess of 400%. This was a form of arbitrage, or profiting by buying an asset at a lower price in one market and immediately selling it in a market where the price is higher, which is legal.

Seeing an opportunity, Ponzi quit his job as a translator to execute his IRC scheme, but needed a large capital expense to buy IRCs at lower performing European currencies. He first tried to borrow money from several banks, including the Hanover Trust Company, but they were not convinced, and its manager, Chmielinski, refused to lend him money.

Subsequently, Ponzi set up a stock company to raise money from the public. He also went to several of his friends in Boston and promised that he would double their investment in 90 days, in an environment when banks were paying only 5% annual interest. The great returns from postal reply coupons, he explained to them, made such incredible profits easy to accomplish. Some people invested and were paid as promised, receiving $750 in interest on initial investments of $1,250.

=== Securities Exchange Company ===

In January 1920, Ponzi started his own company, the &quot;Securities Exchange Company&quot;, to promote the scheme. In the first month, 18 people invested in his company with a total of $1,800. He paid them promptly, the very next month, with money obtained from a newer set of investors.

Ponzi set up a larger office, this time in the Niles Building on School Street. Word spread, and investments increased rapidly. Ponzi hired agents and paid them generous commissions. Between February and March 1920, the total amount invested had risen from $5,000 to $25,000 ($ to $ in , respectively). As the scheme grew, Ponzi hired agents to seek out new investors in New England and New Jersey. At that time, investors were being paid impressive rates, which subsequently encouraged others to invest. By May 1920, he had made $420,000 (). By June 1920, people had invested $2.5 million in Ponzi&#x27;s scheme (). By July, he was approaching a million dollars per day.

Ponzi began depositing the money in the Hanover Trust Bank of Boston (a small bank on Hanover Street in the mostly Italian North End), in the hope that once his account was large enough he could impose his will on the bank or even be made its president; he bought a controlling interest in the bank through himself and several friends after depositing $3 million. By July 1920, Ponzi had made millions. Some of his investors had been mortgaging their homes and investing their life savings. Most did not take their profits but reinvested. Ponzi&#x27;s company, meanwhile, had set up branches from Maine to New Jersey.

Even though Ponzi&#x27;s company was bringing in fantastic sums of money each day, the simplest financial analysis would have shown that the operation was running at a large loss. As long as money kept flowing in, existing investors could be paid with the new money. This was the only method Ponzi had to continue providing returns to existing investors, as he made no effort to generate legitimate profits.

Ponzi&#x27;s initial investors consisted of working-class immigrants like himself. Gradually, news travelled upwards, and many well-to-do Boston Brahmins also invested in his scheme. In its heyday, nearly 75% of Boston&#x27;s police force had invested in the scheme. Ponzi&#x27;s investors even included those closest to him, like his chauffeur John Collins and his own brother-in-law. Ponzi was indiscriminate about whom he allowed to invest, from young newspaper boys investing a few dollars to high-net-worth individuals, like a banker from Lawrence, Kansas, who invested $10,000. 

=== Infeasibility of Ponzi&#x27;s scheme ===
Though Ponzi was still paying back investors, mostly from money from subsequent investors, he had not yet figured out a way to actually change the IRCs to cash. He also subsequently realized that changing the coupons to money was logistically impossible. For example: for the initial 18 investors of January 1920, for their $1,800 investment, it would have taken 53,000 postal coupons to actually realize the arbitrage profits. For the subsequent 15,000 investors that Ponzi had, he would have had to fill &quot;Titanic&quot;-sized ships with postal coupons just to ship them to the U.S. from Europe. However, Ponzi found that all the interest payments returned to him, as investors continued to re-invest.

=== Ponzi&#x27;s subsequent lifestyle ===
Ponzi lived luxuriously: he bought a mansion in Lexington, Massachusetts, and maintained accounts in several banks across New England besides Hanover Trust. He bought a Locomobile, the finest car of that time. He had initially purchased two first-class tickets to Italy for a delayed honeymoon with Rose but instead decided to change them to bring his mother from Italy to the U.S. in a first-class stateroom on an ocean liner. She lived with Ponzi and Rose for some time in Lexington, but died soon after. On July 31, 1920, Ponzi told Father Pasquale Di Milla, the director of the Italian Children&#x27;s Home in Jamaica Plain, that he would donate $100,000 in honor of his mother. Ponzi also bought a macaroni company and part of a wine company in an attempt to gain profits that could be used to repay the investors of his IRC scheme.

=== Suspicion ===
Ponzi&#x27;s rapid rise naturally drew suspicion. When a Boston financial writer suggested there was no way Ponzi could legally deliver such high returns in a short period of time, Ponzi sued for libel and won $500,000 in damages. As libel law at the time placed the burden of proof on the writer and publisher, this effectively neutralized any serious probes into his dealings for some time.

Nonetheless, there were still signs of his eventual ruin. Joseph Daniels, a Boston furniture dealer who had given Ponzi furniture which he could not afford to pay for, sued Ponzi to cash in on the gold rush. The lawsuit was unsuccessful, but it did prompt people to begin asking how Ponzi could have gone from being penniless to being a millionaire in a short span of time. There was a run on the Securities Exchange Company, as some investors decided to pull out. Ponzi paid them and the run stopped.

On July 24, 1920, &quot;The Boston Post&quot; printed a favorable article on Ponzi and his scheme that brought in investors faster than ever. At that time, Ponzi was making $250,000 a day. Ponzi&#x27;s good fortune was increased by the fact that just below this favorable article, which seemed to imply that Ponzi was indeed returning 50% return on an investment after only 45 days, was a bank advertisement that stated that the bank was paying 5% returns annually. The next business day after this article was published, Ponzi arrived at his office to find thousands of Bostonians waiting to give him their money.

Despite this reprieve, &quot;Post&quot; acting publisher Richard Grozier (who was running the paper in the absence of his father Edwin, its owner and publisher) and city editor Eddie Dunn were suspicious and assigned investigative reporters to look into Ponzi. He was also under investigation by Massachusetts authorities, and, on the day the &quot;Post&quot; printed its article, Ponzi met with state officials. He managed to divert the officials from checking his books by offering to stop taking money during the investigation, a fortunate choice, as proper records were not being kept. Ponzi&#x27;s offer temporarily calmed the suspicions of the state officials.

=== Collapse of the scheme ===

On July 26, the &quot;Post&quot; started a series of articles that asked hard questions about the operation of Ponzi&#x27;s money machine. The paper contacted Clarence Barron, the financial journalist who headed Dow Jones &amp; Company, to examine Ponzi&#x27;s scheme. Barron observed that though Ponzi was offering fantastic returns on investments, Ponzi himself was not investing with his own company.

Barron then noted that to cover the investments made with the Securities Exchange Company, 160 million postal reply coupons would have to be in circulation. However, only about 27,000 actually were in circulation. The United States Post Office stated that postal reply coupons were not being bought in quantity at home or abroad. The gross profit margin in percent on buying and selling each IRC was colossal, but the overhead required to handle the purchase and redemption of these items, which were of extremely low cost and were sold individually, would have exceeded the gross profit (see #Infeasibility of Ponzi&#x27;s scheme). Barron noted that if Ponzi really was doing what he claimed to do, he would effectively be profiting at the expense of a government—either the governments where he bought the coupons or the U.S. government. For this reason, Barron argued that even if Ponzi&#x27;s operation was legitimate, it was immoral to take advantage of a government in this manner.

The &quot;Post&quot; articles caused a panic run on the Securities Exchange Company. Ponzi paid out $2 million in three days to a wild crowd outside his office. He canvassed the crowd, passed out coffee and doughnuts, and cheerfully told them they had nothing to worry about. Many changed their minds and left their money with him. However, this attracted the attention of Daniel Gallagher, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. Gallagher commissioned Edwin Pride to audit the Securities Exchange Company&#x27;s books—an effort made difficult by the fact Ponzi&#x27;s bookkeeping system consisted merely of index cards with investors&#x27; names.

In the meantime, Ponzi had hired a publicist, William McMasters. However, McMasters quickly became suspicious of Ponzi&#x27;s endless talk of postal reply coupons, as well as the ongoing investigation against him. He later described Ponzi as a &quot;financial idiot&quot; who did not seem to know how to add. The investigation into Ponzi began in late July, when McMasters found several highly incriminating documents that indicated Ponzi was merely &quot;robbing Peter to pay Paul&quot;. McMasters went to Grozier, his former employer, with this information. Grozier offered him $5,000 for his story, which was printed in the &quot;Post&quot; on August 2, 1920. McMaster&#x27;s article declared Ponzi hopelessly insolvent, reporting that while he claimed $7 million in liquid funds, he was actually at least $2 million in debt. With interest factored in, McMasters wrote, Ponzi was as much as $4.5 million in the red. The story touched off a massive run, and Ponzi paid off in one day. He then sped up plans to build a massive conglomerate that would engage in banking and import/export operations.
Massachusetts Bank Commissioner Joseph Allen became concerned that if major withdrawals exhausted Ponzi&#x27;s reserves, it would bring Boston&#x27;s banking system to its knees. Allen&#x27;s suspicions were further aroused when he found out a large number of Ponzi-controlled accounts had received more than $250,000 in loans from Hanover Trust. This led Allen to speculate that Ponzi was not nearly as well-financed as he claimed, since he was getting large loans from the bank he effectively controlled. He ordered two bank examiners to keep an eye on Ponzi&#x27;s accounts.

On August 9, the bank examiners reported that enough investors had cashed their checks on Ponzi&#x27;s main account there that it was almost certainly overdrawn. Allen then ordered Hanover Trust not to pay out any more checks from Ponzi&#x27;s main account. He also orchestrated an involuntary bankruptcy filing by several small Ponzi investors. The move forced Massachusetts Attorney General J. Weston Allen to release a statement that there was little to support Ponzi&#x27;s claims of large-scale dealings in postal coupons. State officials then invited Ponzi noteholders to come to the Massachusetts State House to furnish their names and addresses for the purpose of the investigation. On the same day, Ponzi received a preview of Pride&#x27;s audit, which revealed Ponzi was at least $7 million in debt.

On August 11, the &quot;Post&quot; published with a front-page story about his criminal activities in Montreal 13 years earlier, including his forgery conviction and his role at Zarossi&#x27;s scandal-ridden bank. That afternoon, Bank Commissioner Allen seized Hanover Trust due to numerous irregularities. The commissioner thus inadvertently foiled Ponzi&#x27;s plan to borrow funds from the bank vaults as a last resort in the event all other efforts to obtain funds failed. The following day, Ponzi&#x27;s certificate of deposit at Hanover Trust, which had been worth $1.5 million, was reduced to $1 million after bank officials tapped into it to cover the overdraft. Even if he had been able to convert it into cash, he would have had only $4 million in assets.

Amid reports that he was about to be arrested any day, Ponzi surrendered to federal authorities and accepted Pride&#x27;s figures. He was charged with mail fraud for sending letters to his marks telling them their notes had matured. He was originally released on $25,000 bail and was immediately re-arrested on state charges of larceny, for which he posted an additional $10,000 bond. After the &quot;Post&quot; released the results of the audit, the bail bondsman feared Ponzi might flee the country and withdrew the bail for the federal charges. Attorney General Allen declared that if Ponzi managed to regain his freedom, the state would seek additional charges and seek a bail high enough to ensure Ponzi would stay in custody.

=== Magnitude of losses ===
The news brought down five other banks in addition to Hanover Trust. Ponzi&#x27;s investors were practically wiped out, receiving less than 30 cents to the dollar. They lost about $20 million in 1920 dollars (approximately $ million in dollars). By comparison, Bernie Madoff&#x27;s similar scheme that collapsed in 2008 cost his investors about $18 billion, 53 times the losses of Ponzi&#x27;s scheme.

== Prison and later life ==
In two federal indictments, Ponzi was charged with 86 counts of mail fraud and faced life imprisonment. At the urging of his wife, Ponzi pleaded guilty on November 1, 1920, to a single count before Judge Clarence Hale, who declared before sentencing, &quot;Here was a man with all the duties of seeking large money. He concocted a scheme which, on his counsel&#x27;s admission, did defraud men and women. It will not do to have the world understand that such a scheme as that can be carried out ... without receiving substantial punishment.&quot; Ponzi was sentenced to five years in federal prison.

=== Massachusetts ===
Ponzi was released after three-and-a-half years and was almost immediately indicted on 22 state charges of larceny, which came as a surprise to Ponzi; he thought he had a deal calling for the state to drop any charges against him if he pleaded guilty to the federal charges. He sued, claiming that he would be facing double jeopardy if Massachusetts essentially retried him for the same offenses spelled out in the federal indictment. The case, &quot;Ponzi v. Fessenden&quot;, made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On March 27, 1922, the Supreme Court ruled that federal plea bargains have no standing regarding state charges. It also ruled that Ponzi was not facing double jeopardy because Massachusetts was charging him with larceny while the federal government charged him with mail fraud, even though the charges implicated the same criminal operation.

In October 1922, Ponzi was tried on the first 10 larceny counts. Since he was insolvent, Ponzi served as his own attorney and, speaking as persuasively as he had with his duped investors, was acquitted by the jury on all charges. He was tried a second time on five of the remaining charges, and the jury deadlocked. Ponzi was found guilty at a third trial, and was sentenced to an additional seven to nine years in prison as &quot;a common and notorious thief&quot;. There were efforts to have him deported as an undesirable alien in 1922.

=== Florida ===
In September 1925, Ponzi was released on bail as he appealed the state conviction. He fled to the Springfield neighborhood of Jacksonville, Florida, and launched the Charpon Land Syndicate (&quot;Charpon&quot; is an amalgamation of his name), seeking to capitalize on the Florida land boom. He offered investors tiny tracts of land, some underwater, and promised 200% returns in 60 days. In reality, it was a scam that sold swampland in Columbia County. Ponzi was indicted by a Duval County grand jury in February 1926 and charged with violating Florida trust and securities laws. A jury found him guilty on the securities charges, and the judge sentenced him to a year in the Florida State Prison. Ponzi appealed his conviction and was freed after posting a $1,500 bond.

Ponzi traveled to Tampa, where he shaved his head, grew a mustache, and tried to flee the country as a crewman on a merchant ship bound for Italy. However, he revealed his identity to a shipmate. Word spread to a deputy sheriff, who followed the ship to its last American port of call in New Orleans and placed Ponzi under arrest. After Ponzi&#x27;s pleas to Calvin Coolidge and Benito Mussolini for deportation were ignored, he was sent back to Massachusetts to serve out his prison term. Ponzi served seven more years in prison.

In the meantime, government investigators tried to trace Ponzi&#x27;s convoluted accounts to figure out how much money he had taken and where it had gone. They never managed to untangle it and could only conclude that millions of dollars had gone through his hands.

=== Italy ===
Ponzi was released in 1934. With the release came an immediate order to have him deported to Italy. He asked for a full pardon from Massachusetts Governor Joseph B. Ely. However, on July 13, Ely turned the appeal down. Ponzi&#x27;s charismatic confidence had faded, and when he left the prison gates, he was met by an angry crowd. He told reporters before he left, &quot;I went looking for trouble, and I found it.&quot; On October 7, Ponzi was officially deported.

Rose stayed in the U.S. and divorced Ponzi in 1937. She had not wanted to leave Boston, and Ponzi was in no position to support her in any event.

In Italy, Ponzi jumped from scheme to scheme, but little came of them. He eventually got a job in Brazil as an agent for Ala Littoria, the Italian state airline. During World War II, however, the airline&#x27;s operation in the country was shut down after the British intelligence services intervened and Brazil sided with the Allies. During that time, Ponzi also wrote his autobiography.

== Death ==
Ponzi spent the last years of his life in poverty, working occasionally as a translator. His health deteriorated and in 1941 a heart attack left him considerably weakened. His eyesight began failing, and by 1948 he was almost completely blind. A brain hemorrhage paralyzed his left leg and arm. Ponzi died in a charity hospital in Rio de Janeiro, the Hospital São Francisco de Assis of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, on January 18, 1949.

Supported by his last and only friend, Francisco Nonato Nunes, a barber who spoke English and had notions of Italian, Ponzi granted one last interview to an American reporter, telling him, &quot;Even if they never got anything for it, it was cheap at that price. Without malice aforethought, I had given them the best show that was ever staged in their territory since the landing of the Pilgrims! It was easily worth fifteen million bucks to watch me put the thing over.&quot;

<text>The Uffizi Gallery ( ; , ) is a prominent art museum located adjacent to the Piazza della Signoria in the Historic Centre of Florence in the region of Tuscany, Italy. One of the most important Italian museums and the most visited, it is also one of the largest and best-known in the world and holds a collection of priceless works, particularly from the period of the Italian Renaissance.

After the ruling House of Medici died out, their art collections were given to the city of Florence under the famous &quot;Patto di famiglia&quot; negotiated by Anna Maria Luisa, the last Medici heiress. The Uffizi is one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1769 it was officially opened to the public, formally becoming a museum in 1865.

==History==

The building of the Uffizi complex was begun by Giorgio Vasari in 1560 for Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici as a means to consolidate his administrative control of the various committees, agencies, and guilds established in Florence&#x27;s Republican past so as to accommodate them all in one place, hence the name , &quot;offices&quot;. The construction was later continued by Alfonso Parigi and Bernardo Buontalenti; it was completed in 1581. The top floor was made into a gallery for the family and their guests and included their collection of Roman sculptures.

The &quot;cortile&quot; (internal courtyard) is so long, narrow, and open to the Arno at its far end through a Doric screen that articulates the space without blocking it, that architectural historians treat it as the first regularized streetscape of Europe. Vasari, a painter, and architect as well, emphasized its perspective length by adorning it with the matching facades&#x27; continuous roof cornices, and unbroken cornices between storeys, as well as the three continuous steps on which the museum fronts stand. The niches in the piers that alternate with columns of the Loggiato are filled with sculptures of famous artists in the 19th century.


The Uffizi brought together under one roof the administrative offices and the Archivio di Stato, the state archive. The project was intended to display prime artworks of the Medici collections on the piano nobile; the plan was carried out by his son, Grand Duke Francesco I. He commissioned the architect Buontalenti to design the Tribuna degli Uffizi that would display a series of masterpieces in one room, including jewels; it became a highly influential attraction of a Grand Tour. The octagonal room was completed in 1584.

Over the years, more sections of the building were recruited to exhibit paintings and sculptures collected or commissioned by the Medici. For many years, 45 to 50 rooms were used to display paintings from the 13th to 18th century.

==Modern times==
Because of its vast collection, some of the Uffizi&#x27;s works have in the past been transferred to other museums in Florence—for example, some famous statues to the Bargello. A project was finished in 2006 to expand the museum&#x27;s exhibition space some 6,000 metres2 (64,000 ft2) to almost 13,000 metres2 (139,000 ft2), allowing public viewing of many artworks that had usually been in storage.

The Nuovi Uffizi (New Uffizi) renovation project which started in 1989 was progressing well from 2015 to 2017. It was intended to modernize all of the halls and more than double the display space. A new exit was also planned and the lighting, air conditioning and security systems were updated. During construction, the museum remained open, although rooms were closed as necessary with the artwork temporarily moved to another location. For example, the Botticelli rooms and two others with early Renaissance paintings were closed for 15 months but reopened in October 2016.

Over two million visitors visited the Uffizi in 2016, making it the most visited art gallery in Italy. At peak periods (particularly in July), waiting times for entry can be up to five hours. Advance tickets can be bought online, to significantly reduce the waiting time. In 2018 a revised ticketing system was introduced to reduce queuing times to just minutes.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the museum was closed for 150 days in 2020, and attendance plunged by 72 percent to 659,043. Nonetheless, the Uffizi was twenty-seventh in the list of most-visited art museums in the world in 2020. Works from the Uffizi gallery collection are now available for remote viewing on Google Arts and Culture. The museum reopened in May 2021 following a renovation that included an addition of 14 new rooms and a display of additional 129 artworks, with the museum attempting to give more voice to historically under-represented groups including women and people of color.

==Incidents==
On 27 May 1993, the Sicilian Mafia carried out a car bomb explosion in Via dei Georgofili which damaged parts of the palace and killed five people. The blast destroyed five pieces of art and damaged another 30. Some of the paintings were fully protected by bulletproof glass. The most severe damage was to the Niobe room and classical sculptures and neoclassical interior, which have since been restored, although its frescoes were damaged beyond repair.

On 22 July 2022, members of the climate activist group Ultima Generazione (Last Generation) glued themselves to the glass protecting Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Primavera&quot; demanding an end to fossil fuel usage. The painting was undamaged.

On 13 February 2024, members of Ultima Generazione glued images of flooding in Tuscany in 2023 to the glass protecting Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; in protest over the Italian government&#x27;s inaction on climate change. The painting was undamaged and the images were removed.

==Key works==
The collection also contains some ancient sculptures, such as the &quot;Arrotino&quot;, the &quot;Two Wrestlers&quot;, &quot;Venus de&#x27; Medici&quot;, and the &quot;Bust of Severus Giovanni&quot;.

<doc id="45856" wikidata="Q44613" url="?curid=45856" title="Monastery">
<text>A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone (hermits). A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church, or temple, and may also serve as an oratory, or in the case of communities anything from a single building housing only one senior and two or three junior monks or nuns, to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds. A monastery complex typically comprises a number of buildings which include a church, dormitory, cloister, refectory, library, and infirmary and outlying granges. Depending on the location, the monastic order and the occupation of its inhabitants, the complex may also include a wide range of buildings that facilitate self-sufficiency and service to the community. These may include a hospice, a school, and a range of agricultural and manufacturing buildings such as a barn, a forge, or a brewery.

In English usage, the term &quot;monastery&quot; is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of monks. In modern usage, &quot;convent&quot; tends to be applied only to institutions of female monastics (nuns), particularly communities of teaching or nursing religious sisters. Historically, a convent denoted a house of friars (reflecting the Latin), now more commonly called a &quot;friary&quot;. Various religions may apply these terms in more specific ways.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;monastery&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;μοναστήριον&quot;, neut. of &quot;μοναστήριος&quot; – &quot;monasterios&quot; from &quot;μονάζειν&quot; – &quot;monazein&quot; &quot;to live alone&quot; from the root &quot;μόνος&quot; – &quot;monos&quot; &quot;alone&quot; (originally all Christian monks were hermits); the suffix &quot;-terion&quot; denotes a &quot;place for doing something&quot;. The earliest extant use of the term &quot;monastērion&quot; is by the 1st century AD Jewish philosopher Philo in &quot;On The Contemplative Life,&quot; ch. III.

In England, the word &quot;monastery&quot; was also applied to the habitation of a bishop and the cathedral clergy who lived apart from the lay community. Most cathedrals were not monasteries, and were served by canons secular, which were communal but not monastic. However, some were run by monasteries orders, such as Durham Cathedral. Westminster Abbey was for a short time a cathedral, and was a Benedictine monastery until the Reformation, and its Chapter preserves elements of the Benedictine tradition. See the entry cathedral. They are also to be distinguished from collegiate churches, such as St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor.

===Terms===
The term &quot;monastery&quot; is used generically to refer to any of a number of types of religious community. In the Roman Catholic religion and to some extent in certain branches of Buddhism, there is a somewhat more specific definition of the term and many related terms.

Buddhist monasteries are generally called vihara (Pali language el). Viharas may be occupied by men or women, and in keeping with common English usage, a vihara populated by females may often be called a nunnery or a convent. However, vihara can also refer to a temple. In Tibetan Buddhism, monasteries are often called gompa. In Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, a monastery is called a &quot;wat&quot;. In Burma, a monastery is called a &quot;kyaung&quot;.

A Christian monastery may be an abbey (i.e., under the rule of an abbot), or a priory (under the rule of a prior), or conceivably a hermitage (the dwelling of a hermit). It may be a community of men (monks) or of women (nuns). A charterhouse is any monastery belonging to the Carthusian order. In Eastern Christianity, a very small monastic community can be called a skete, and a very large or important monastery can be given the dignity of a lavra.

The great communal life of a Christian monastery is called cenobitic, as opposed to the anchoretic (or anchoritic) life of an anchorite and the eremitic life of a hermit. There has also been, mostly under the Osmanli occupation of Greece and Cyprus, an &quot;idiorrhythmic&quot; lifestyle where monks come together but being able to own things individually and not being obliged to work for the common good.

In Hinduism monasteries are called matha, mandir, koil, or most commonly an ashram.

Jains use the Buddhist term vihara.

==Monastic life==

In most religions, life inside monasteries is governed by community rules that stipulate the gender of the inhabitants and require them to remain celibate and own little or no personal property. The degree to which life inside a particular monastery is socially separate from the surrounding populace can also vary widely; some religious traditions mandate isolation for purposes of contemplation removed from the everyday world, in which case members of the monastic community may spend most of their time isolated even from each other. Others focus on interacting with the local communities to provide services, such as teaching, medical care, or evangelism. Some monastic communities are only occupied seasonally, depending both on the traditions involved and the local climate, and people may be part of a monastic community for periods ranging from a few days at a time to almost an entire lifetime.
Life within the walls of a monastery may be supported in several ways: by manufacturing and selling goods, often agricultural products; by donations or alms; by rental or investment incomes; and by funds from other organizations within the religion, which in the past formed the traditional support of monasteries. There has been a long tradition of Christian monasteries providing hospitable, charitable and hospital services. Monasteries have often been associated with the provision of education and the encouragement of scholarship and research, which has led to the establishment of schools and colleges and the association with universities. Monastic life has adapted to modern society by offering computer services, accounting services and management as well as modern hospital and educational administration.

==Buddhism==

Buddhist monasteries, known as vihāra in Pali and in Sanskrit, emerged sometime around the fourth century BCE from the practice of vassa, a retreat undertaken by Buddhist monastics during the South Asian wet season. To prevent wandering monks and nuns from disturbing new plant-growth or becoming stranded in inclement weather, they were instructed to remain in a fixed location for the roughly three-month period typically beginning in mid-July.

These early fixed &quot;vassa&quot; retreats took place in pavilions and parks that wealthy supporters had donated to the sangha. Over the years, the custom of staying on property held in common by the &quot;sangha&quot; as a whole during the &quot;vassa&quot; retreat evolved into cenobitic monasticism, in which monks and nuns resided year-round in monasteries.

In India, Buddhist monasteries gradually developed into centres of learning where philosophical principles were developed and debated; this tradition continues in the monastic universities of Vajrayana Buddhists, as well as in religious schools and universities founded by religious orders across the Buddhist world. In modern times, living a settled life in a monastery setting has become the most common lifestyle for Buddhist monks and nuns across the globe.

Whereas early monasteries are considered to have been held in common by the entire sangha, in later years this tradition diverged in a number of countries. Despite &quot;vinaya&quot; prohibitions on possessing wealth, many monasteries became large landowners, much like monasteries in medieval Christian Europe. In Chinese Buddhism, peasant families worked monastic-owned land in exchange for paying a portion of their yearly crop to the resident monks in the monastery, just as they would to a feudal landlord. In Sri Lanka and in Tibetan Buddhism, the ownership of a monastery often became vested in a single monk, who would often keep the property within the family by passing it on to a nephew ordained as a monk. In Japan, where civil authorities permitted Buddhist monks to marry, the position of head of a temple or monastery sometimes became hereditary, passed from father to son over many generations.

Forest monasteries – most commonly found in the Theravada traditions of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka – are monasteries dedicated primarily to the study and cultivation of Buddhist meditation, rather than to scholarship or ceremonial duties. Forest monasteries often function like early Christian monasteries, with small groups of monks living an essentially hermit-like life gathered loosely around a respected elder teacher. While the wandering lifestyle practised by the Buddha and by his disciples continues to be the ideal model for forest-tradition monks in Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and elsewhere, practical concerns - including shrinking wilderness areas, lack of access to lay supporters, dangerous wildlife, and dangerous border conflicts - dictate that increasing numbers of &quot;meditation&quot; monks live in monasteries, rather than wandering.

Tibetan Buddhist monasteries or gompas are sometimes known as lamaseries, with their monks sometimes (mistakenly) known as lamas. Helena Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophical Society named its initial New York City meeting-place &quot;the Lamasery&quot;.

Famous Buddhist monasteries include:
* Donglin Temple, Jiangxi, China
* Jetavana, Shravasti (India)
* Nalanda, India
* Shaolin Monastery, China
* Tengboche Monastery, Nepal
For a further list of Buddhist monasteries see list of Buddhist temples.

===Trends===
Buddhist monasteries include some of the largest in the world. Drepung Monastery in Tibet housed around 10,000 monks prior to the Chinese invasion
in 1950–1951. the relocated monastery in India houses around 8,000.

==Christianity==

According to tradition, Christian monasticism began in Egypt with Anthony the Great. Originally, all Christian monks were hermits seldom encountering other people.

A transitional form of monasticism was later created by Ammonas in which &quot;solitary&quot; monks lived close enough to one another to offer mutual support as well as gathering together on Sundays for common services.

It was Pachomius the Great who developed the idea of cenobitic monasticism: having renunciates live together and worship together under the same roof. Some attribute his mode of communal living to the barracks of the Roman Army in which Pachomios served as a young man. Soon the Egyptian desert blossomed with monasteries, especially around Nitria (Wadi El Natrun), which was called the &quot;Holy City&quot;. Estimates are that upwards of 50,000 monks lived in this area at any one time. Eremetism never died out though, but was reserved only for those advanced monks who had worked out their problems within a cenobitic monastery.

The idea caught on, and other places followed:
* Upon his return from the Council of Serdica, Athanasius of Alexandria established the first Christian monastery in Europe circa 344 near modern-day Chirpan in Bulgaria.
* Mar Awgin founded a monastery on Mount Izla above Nusaybin in Mesopotamia (~350), and from this monastery the cenobitic tradition spread in Mesopotamia, Persia, Armenia, Georgia and even India and China.
* Mar Saba organized the monks of the Judaean Desert in a monastery close to Bethlehem (483), and this is considered the mother of all monasteries of Eastern Orthodoxy.
* Benedict of Nursia founded the monastery of Monte Cassino in Italy (529), which was the seed of Roman Catholic monasticism in general, and of the Order of Saint Benedict in particular.
* The Carthusians were founded by Bruno of Cologne at the Grande Chartreuse, from which the religious Order takes its name, in the eleventh century as an eremitical community, and remains the motherhouse of the Order.
* Jerome and Paula of Rome decided to go and live a hermit&#x27;s life in Bethlehem and founded several monasteries in the Holy Land. This way of life inspired the foundation of the Hieronymites in Spain and Portugal. The Monastery of Santa María del Parral in Segovia is the motherhouse of the Order.

===Western medieval Europe===

The life of prayer and communal living was one of rigorous schedules and self-sacrifice. Prayer was their work, and the Office prayers took up much of a monk&#x27;s waking hours – Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, daily Mass, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. In between prayers, monks were allowed to sit in the cloister and work on their projects of writing, copying, or decorating books. These would have been assigned based on a monk&#x27;s abilities and interests. The non-scholastic types were assigned to physical labour of varying degrees.

The main meal of the day took place around noon, often taken at a refectory table, and consisted of the most simple and bland foods e.g., poached fish, boiled oats. While they ate, scripture would be read from a pulpit above them. Since no other words were allowed to be spoken, monks developed communicative gestures. Abbots and notable guests were honoured with a seat at the high table, while everyone else sat perpendicular to that in the order of seniority. This practice remained when some monasteries became universities after the first millennium, and can still be seen at Oxford University and Cambridge University.

Monasteries were important contributors to the surrounding community. They were centres of intellectual progression and education. They welcomed aspiring priests to come and study and learn, allowing them even to challenge doctrine in dialogue with superiors. The earliest forms of musical notation are attributed to a monk named Notker of St Gall, and was spread to musicians throughout Europe by way of the interconnected monasteries. Since monasteries offered respite for weary pilgrim travellers, monks were obligated also to care for their injuries or emotional needs. Over time, lay people started to make pilgrimages &quot;to&quot; monasteries instead of just using them as a stopover. By this time, they had sizeable libraries that attracted learned tourists. Families would donate a son in return for blessings. During the plagues, monks helped to till the fields and provide food for the sick.

A Warming House is a common part of a medieval monastery, where monks went to warm themselves. It was often the only room in the monastery where a fire was lit.

====Catholic====

A number of distinct monastic orders developed within Roman Catholicism:

* Camaldolese monks
* Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross, priests and brothers, all of whom live together like monks according to the Rule of St. Augustine;
* Carmelite hermits and Carmelite nuns (from the Ancient Observance and Discalced branch);
* Cistercian Order, with monks and nuns (both of the Original Observance and of the Trappist reform);
* Monks and Sisters of Bethlehem
* Order of Minims, founded by Francis of Paola
* Order of Saint Benedict, known as the Benedictine monks and nuns, founded by Benedict of Nursia with Scholastica, stresses manual labour in self-subsistent monasteries. See also: Cluniac Reforms;
* Order of Saint Claire, best known as the Poor Clares (of all the observances);
* Order of Saint Jerome, inspired by Jerome and Paula of Rome, known as the Hieronymite monks and nuns;
* Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit, known as the Pauline Fathers;
* Order of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also known as Sisters of the Annunciation or Annociades, founded by Joan of France;
* Order of the Carthusians, a hermitical religious order founded by Bruno of Cologne;
* Order of the Immaculate Conception, also known as the Conceptionists, founded by Beatrice of Silva;
* Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, also known as Turchine Nuns or Blue Nuns, founded by Maria Vittoria De Fornari Strata;
* Order of the Most Holy Savior, known as Bridgettine nuns and monks, founded by Bridget of Sweden;
* Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary, known as the Visitandine nuns, founded by Francis de Sales and Jane Frances de Chantal;
* Passionists
* Premonstratensian canons (&quot;The White Canons&quot;)
* Tironensian monks (&quot;The Grey Monks&quot;)
* Valliscaulian monks

While in English most mendicant Orders use the monastic terms of monastery or priory, in the Latin languages, the term used by the friars for their houses is convent, from the Latin &quot;conventus&quot;, e.g., () or (), meaning &quot;gathering place&quot;. The Franciscans rarely use the term &quot;monastery&quot; at present, preferring to call their house a &quot;friary&quot;. 

=== Eastern Orthodox ===


In the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Church, both monks and nuns follow a similar ascetic discipline, and even their religious habit is the same (though nuns wear an extra veil, called the &quot;apostolnik&quot;). Unlike Roman Catholic monasticism, the Eastern Orthodox do not have distinct religious orders, but a single monastic form throughout the Eastern Orthodox Church. Monastics, male or female, live away from the world, in order to pray for the world.

Monasteries vary from the very large to the very small. There are three types of monastic houses in the Eastern Orthodox Church:
* A cenobium is a monastic community where monks live together, work together, and pray together, following the directions of an abbot and the elder monks. The concept of the cenobitic life is that when many men (or women) live together in a monastic context, like rocks with sharp edges, their &quot;sharpness&quot; becomes worn away and they become smooth and polished. The largest monasteries can hold many thousands of monks and are called &quot;lavras&quot;. In the cenobium the daily office, work and meals are all done in common.
* A skete is a small monastic establishment that usually consist of one elder and two or three disciples. In the skete most prayer and work are done in private, coming together on Sundays and feast days. Thus, skete life has elements of both solitude and community, and for this reason is called the &quot;middle way&quot;.
* A hermit is a monk who practises asceticism but lives in solitude rather than in a monastic community.

One of the great centres of Eastern Orthodox monasticism is Mount Athos in Greece, which, like Vatican City, is self-governing. It is located on an isolated peninsula approximately long and wide, and is administered by the heads of the 20 monasteries. Today the population of the Holy Mountain is around 2,200 men only and can only be visited by men with special permission granted by both the Greek government and the government of the Holy Mountain itself.

===Oriental Orthodox===

The Oriental Orthodox churches, distinguished by their Miaphysite beliefs, consist of the Armenian Apostolic Church, Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria (whose Patriarch is considered first among equals for the following churches), Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Indian Orthodox Church, and Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch.

The monasteries of St. Macarius (&quot;Deir Abu Makaria&quot;) and St. Anthony (&quot;Deir Mar Antonios&quot;) are the oldest monasteries in the world and under the patronage of the Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church.

===Others===
The last years of the 18th century marked in the Christian Church the beginnings of growth of monasticism among Protestant denominations. The center of this movement was in the United States and Canada beginning with the Shaker Church, which was founded in England and then moved to the United States. In the 19th century many of these monastic societies were founded as Utopian communities based on the monastic model in many cases. Aside from the Shakers, there were the Amanna, the Anabaptists, and others. Many did allow marriage but most had a policy of celibacy and communal life in which members shared all things communally and disavowed personal ownership.

In the 19th-century monasticism was revived in the Church of England, leading to the foundation of such institutions as the House of the Resurrection, Mirfield (Community of the Resurrection), Nashdom Abbey (Benedictine), Cleeve Priory (Community of the Glorious Ascension) and Ewell Monastery (Cistercian), Benedictine orders, Franciscan orders and the Orders of the Holy Cross, Order of St. Helena. Other Protestant Christian denominations also engage in monasticism, particularly Lutherans in Europe and North America. For example, the Benedictine order of the Holy Cross at St Augustine&#x27;s House in Michigan is a Lutheran order of monks and there are Lutheran religious communities in Sweden and Germany. In the 1960s, experimental monastic groups were formed in which both men and women were members of the same house and also were permitted to be married and have childrenthese were operated on a communal form.

=== Trends ===

There is a growing Christian neo-monasticism, particularly among evangelical Christians.

==Hinduism==

===Advaita Vedanta===
In Hinduism, monks have existed for a long time, and with them, their respective monasteries, called mathas. Important among them are the chatur-amnaya mathas established by Adi Shankara which formed the nodal centres of under whose guidance the ancient Order of Advaitin monks were re-organised under ten names of the Dashanami Sampradaya.

* Ramakrishna Math

===Sri Vaishnava===
Ramanuja heralded a new era in the world of Hinduism by reviving the lost faith in it and gave a firm doctrinal basis to the Vishishtadvaita philosophy which had existed since time immemorial. He ensured the establishment of a number of mathas of his Sri Vaishnava creed at different important centres of pilgrimage.

*Emar Matha at Puri
*Sriranga Narayana Jeeyar Mutt at Srirangam
*Tirumala Pedda Jeeyangar Mutt at Tirupati
Later on, other famous Sri Vaishnava theologians and religious heads established various important mathas such as
*Vanamamalai Mutt
*Parakala Mutt
*Ahobila Mutt

===Nimbarka Vaishnava===
Nimbarka Sampradaya of Nimbarkacharya is popular in North, West and East India and has several important Mathas.
*Nimbarakacharya Peeth at Salemabad, Rajasthan
*Kathia Baba ka Sthaan at Vrindavan
*Ukhra Mahanta Asthal at Ukhra in West Bengal
*Howrah Nimbarka Ashram at Howrah

===Dvaita Vedanta===
Ashta matha (eight monasteries) of Udupi were founded by Madhvacharya (Madhwa acharya), a dwaitha philosopher.
* Gaud Saraswat Math
* Kashi Math at Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh
* Gokarna Math at Canacona, Goa

==Jainism==
Jainism, founded by Mahavira , had its own monasteries since 5th century BC.

==Sufism==
Islam discourages monasticism, which is referred to in the Quran as &quot;an invention&quot;. However, the term &quot;Sufi&quot; is applied to Muslim mystics who, as a means of achieving union with Allah, adopted ascetic practices including wearing a garment made of coarse wool called &quot;sf&quot;. The term &quot;Sufism&quot; comes from &quot;sf&quot; meaning the person, who wears &quot;sf&quot;. But in the course of time, Sufi has come to designate all Muslim believers in mystic union.

== Monasteries in literature ==
Matthew Lewis&#x27; 1796 Gothic Novel &quot;The Monk&quot; has as parts of its setting both a fictional monastery and nunnery in Spain at the time of the Inquisition. Many have interpreted Lewis&#x27; novel as a critique of Catholicism. Jane Austen sets the latter half of her 1818 novel &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; in an out of use monastery, reflecting on Henry VIII&#x27;s abolition of monasticism in England and the contemporary abolition of monasticism in France in the wake of the French Revolution. Convents for female monastics, or nunneries, were often portrayed as punishments for women unable or unwilling to marry. 

In the 1880 novel &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, Fyodor Dostoyevsky was heavily inspired by real-life accounts of Orthodox monasticism. Parts of the novel focus in particular on the controversy surrounding the institution of &quot;elderhood&quot; in Orthodox Monasticism. Dostoyevsky&#x27;s understanding of the tradition of elderhood is taken largely from &quot;Life of Elder Leonid of Optina&quot; by Father Kliment Zeder-gol&#x27;m, from which he quotes directly in chapter 5, book 1 of the Brother&#x27;s Karamazov. 

The 1980 historical novel The Name of the Rose, by Italian author, philosopher, and semiotician Umberto Eco is set in a monastery in Italy in the year 1327, and the book creates a tableau of monastic life in the 14th century. It is an intellectual murder mystery; said to be a postmodernist work, combining metanarrative and semiotics with biblical analysis and medieval studies. The narrative itself takes place at a Benedictine abbey during the controversy regarding the doctrines about the absolute poverty of Christ and apostolic poverty between branches of the Franciscan and Dominican orders. The setting was inspired by the monumental Saint Michael&#x27;s Abbey in Susa Valley, Piedmont.

<doc id="45857" wikidata="Q1414214" url="?curid=45857" title="Hurwitz polynomial">
<text>In mathematics, a Hurwitz polynomial (named after German mathematician Adolf Hurwitz) is a polynomial whose roots (zeros) are located in the left half-plane of the complex plane or on the imaginary axis, that is, the real part of every root is zero or negative. Such a polynomial must have coefficients that are positive real numbers. The term is sometimes restricted to polynomials whose roots have real parts that are strictly negative, excluding the imaginary axis (i.e., a Hurwitz stable polynomial).

A polynomial function of a complex variable is said to be Hurwitz if the following conditions are satisfied:

# is real when is real.
# The roots of have real parts which are zero or negative.

Hurwitz polynomials are important in control systems theory, because they represent the characteristic equations of stable linear systems. Whether a polynomial is Hurwitz can be determined by solving the equation to find the roots, or from the coefficients without solving the equation by the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion.

== Examples ==

A simple example of a Hurwitz polynomial is:

:formula_1

The only real solution is −1, because it factors as

:formula_2

In general, all quadratic polynomials with positive coefficients are Hurwitz.
This follows directly from the quadratic formula:
:formula_3
where, if the discriminant &quot;b&quot;2−4&quot;ac&quot; is less than zero, then the polynomial will have two complex-conjugate solutions with real part −&quot;b&quot;/2&quot;a&quot;, which is negative for positive &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.
If the discriminant is equal to zero, there will be two coinciding real solutions at −&quot;b&quot;/2&quot;a&quot;. Finally, if the discriminant is greater than zero, there will be two real negative solutions,
because formula_4 for positive &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;.

== Properties ==

For a polynomial to be Hurwitz, it is necessary but not sufficient that all of its coefficients be positive (except for quadratic polynomials, which also imply sufficiency). A necessary and sufficient condition that a polynomial is Hurwitz is that it passes the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion. A given polynomial can be efficiently tested to be Hurwitz or not by using the Routh continued fraction expansion technique.

<doc id="45858" wikidata="Q1329252" url="?curid=45858" title="Intellectual capital">
<text>Intellectual capital is the result of mental processes that form a set of intangible objects that can be used in economic activity and bring income to its owner (organization), covering the competencies of its people (human capital), the value relating to its relationships (relational capital), and everything that is left when the employees go home (structural capital), of which intellectual property (IP) is but one component. It is the sum of everything everybody in a company knows that gives it a competitive edge. The term is used in academia in an attempt to account for the value of intangible assets not listed explicitly on a company&#x27;s balance sheets. On a national level, intellectual capital refers to national intangible capital (NIC).

A second meaning that is used in academia and was adopted in large corporations is focused on the recycling of knowledge via knowledge management and intellectual capital management (ICM). Creating, shaping and updating the stock of intellectual capital requires the formulation of a strategic vision, which blends together all three dimensions of intellectual capital within the organisational context through exploration, exploitation, measurement, and disclosure. Intellectual capital is used in assessing the wealth of organizations. A metric for the value of intellectual capital is the amount by which the enterprise value of a firm exceeds the value of its tangible (physical and financial) assets. Directly visible on corporate books is capital embodied in its physical assets and financial capital; however all three make up the value of an enterprise. Measuring the real value and the total performance of intellectual capital&#x27;s components is a critical part of running a company in the knowledge economy and Information Age. Understanding the intellectual capital in an enterprise allows leveraging of its intellectual assets. For a corporation, the result will optimize its stock price.

The IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) committee developed the International Accounting System 38 with the purpose of prescribing the accounting treatment for intangible assets. IAS 38.8 defines an intangible asset as an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. An asset is a resource that is controlled by the entity as the result of past events (for example purchase or self-creation) and from which future economic benefits (inflows of cash or other benefits) are expected.

==Classification==
Intellectual capital is normally classified as follows:

*Human capital, the value that the employees of a business provide through the application of skills, know-how and expertise Human capital is an organization&#x27;s combined human capability for solving business problems and exploiting its intellectual property. Human capital is inherent in people and cannot be owned by an organization. Therefore, human capital can leave an organization when people leave, and if the management has failed to provide a setting where others can pick up their know-how. Human capital also encompasses how effectively an organization uses its people resources as measured by creativity and Innovation.
*Structural capital, the supportive non-physical infrastructure, processes and databases of the organisation that enable human capital to function Structural capital includes processes, patents, and trademarks, as well as the organization&#x27;s image, organization, information system, and proprietary software and databases. Because of its diverse components, structural capital can be classified further into organization, process and innovation capital. Organizational capital includes the organization philosophy and systems for leveraging the organization&#x27;s capability. Process capital includes the techniques, procedures, and programs that implement and enhance the delivery of goods and services. Innovation capital includes intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and copyrights, and intangible assets. Intellectual properties are protected commercial rights such as patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks. Intangible assets are all of the other talents and theory by which an organization is run.
*Relational capital, consisting of such elements as customer relationships, supplier relationships, trademarks and trade names (which have value only by virtue of customer relationships), licences, and franchises The notion that customer capital is separate from human and structural capital indicates its central importance to an organization&#x27;s worth. The value of the relationships a business maintains with its customers and suppliers is also referred as goodwill, but often poorly booked in corporate accounts, because of accounting rules.

==Management==
The intangible nature of many knowledge products and processes, in combination with the increasing importance of their value in corporate balance sheets leads to a growing interest in management of intellectual capital. Creating, shaping and updating the stock of intellectual capital requires the formulation of a strategic vision, which blends together all three dimensions of intellectual capital (human, structural and relational capital) within the organisational context through exploration and exploitation, measurement and disclosure. Therefore, the organisational value of intellectual capital is developed via an ongoing and emergent process focused on the capability to leverage, develop and change the dimensions. The management of intellectual capital is conceptualised as occurring via a multiple stage process, governed by an evolutionary logic. Intellectual capital management is defined as a cycle of four inter-related sets of practices: strategic alignment, exploration and exploitation, measurement, and reporting of intellectual capital.

The recognizing and managing of intellectual capital within organizations is not always evident and straightforward; for example, what IC means differ from organization to organization; thus requiring a contextual understanding.

==Exploitation==
The management of intellectual capital is conceptualised as occurring via a multiple stage process, governed by an evolutionary logic. For a business, translating the potential of its intellectual capital is crucial. Works that focus on the subset, namely the patents, copyrights, and trade secrets, ignore the benefits of their use with the business. Other terms include &quot;intangible assets&quot;. While corporate reports often stress the value and the know-how of its staff, this crucial asset cannot be considered property. The term &quot;workforce-in-place&quot; can be used as a category when companies with their staff are purchased. Without that category, most of the excess purchase price over the tangible book value would just appear as goodwill. In order to profit from intellectual capital, knowledge management has become a task for management. Often, intellectual capital, or at least rights to it, are moved off-shore for exploitation, which entails risks that are hard to value. The transfer of rights to intellectual capital to offshore subsidiaries is a major enabler of corporate tax avoidance.

==Measurement==
An intellectual capital audit is an audit of a company&#x27;s intellectual capital to monitor and oversee the intellectual capital of a firm in order to capitalize on intellectual capital already within the company, and to identify opportunities to increase the intellectual capital of the company.

Early methods of intellectual capital measurement include the balanced scorecard (BSC) framework, the Skandia Navigator, and the Intangible Asset Monitor. Additionally, the Value-Added Intellectual Coefficient method (VAIC) was introduced in 1993 to measure the &quot;value&quot; created by intellectual capital.

== Intellectual capital and stock returns growth ==
Changes in stock returns are primarily determined by external factors such as inflation, exchange rates, and socioeconomic conditions. Intellectual capital does not affect a company stock&#x27;s current earnings. Intellectual capital contributes to a stock&#x27;s return growth.

<doc id="45862" wikidata="Q2132167" url="?curid=45862" title="Raster image processor">
<text>A raster image processor (RIP) is a component used in a printing system which produces a raster image also known as a bitmap. Such a bitmap is used by a later stage of the printing system to produce the printed output. The input may be a page description in a high-level page description language such as PostScript, PDF, or XPS. The input can also be or include bitmaps of higher or lower resolution than the output device, which the RIP resizes using an image scaling algorithm.

Originally a RIP was a rack of electronic hardware which received the page description via some interface (e.g. RS-232) and generated a &quot;hardware bitmap output&quot; which was used to enable or disable each pixel on a real-time output device such as a laser printer, an optical film recorder, computer to film, or computer to plate.

A RIP can be implemented as a software module on a general-purpose computer, or as a firmware program executed on a microprocessor inside a printer. For high-end typesetting, standalone hardware RIPs are sometimes used. Ghostscript, GhostPCL, and ColorBurst&#x27;s Overdrive (for macOS) are examples of software RIPs. Every PostScript printer contains a RIP in its firmware. The RIP chip in a laser printer sends its raster image output to the laser.

Earlier RIPs retained backward compatibility with phototypesetters/photosetters, so they supported the older languages. So, for example, Linotype RIPs supported CORA (RIP30).

==Stages of RIP==
# Interpretation: This is the stage where the supported PDLs (page description languages) are translated into a private internal representation of each page. Most RIPs process pages serially, one page at a time, so the current machine state is only for the current page. After a page has been output, the page state is discarded to prepare for the next page.
# Rendering: A process through which the private internal representation is turned into a continuous-tone bitmap. In practical RIPs, interpretation and rendering are frequently done together. Simple languages were designed to work on minimal hardware, so tend to &quot;directly drive&quot; the renderer.
# Screening: In order to print, the continuous-tone image is converted into a halftone (pattern of dots). Two screening methods or types are &quot;amplitude modulation&quot; (AM) screening and &quot;stochastic&quot; or &quot;frequency modulation&quot; (FM) screening. In AM screening, dot size varies depending on object density—tonal values; dots are placed in a fixed grid. In FM screening, dot size remains constant and dots are placed in random order to create darker or lighter areas of the image; dot placement is precisely controlled by sophisticated mathematical algorithms.

<text>Giulio (Yoel) Racah (; February 9, 1909 – August 28, 1965) was an Italian–Israeli physicist and mathematician. He was Acting President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1961 to 1962.

The crater Racah on the Moon is named after him.

==Biography==
Giulio (Yoel) Racah was born in Florence, Italy. On his mother&#x27;s side, Racah&#x27;s family claimed to trace its ancestry in Italy back to the destruction of the Second Temple. He earned his Doctorate from the University of Florence in 1930, and continued his studies at Rome with Enrico Fermi.

In 1939, due to application of Anti-Jewish laws in Italy, Racah emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine. In the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Racah served as deputy commander of the Israeli forces defending Mount Scopus.

Racah died at the age of 56, apparently asphyxiated by gas from a faulty heater while visiting Florence.

==Academic and scientific career==
In 1937 Racah was appointed Professor of Physics at the University of Pisa. In 1939, after his move to Palestine, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, He later became Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and finally Rector and acting president from 1961 to 1962, following Benjamin Mazar and succeeded by Eliahu Eilat. The physics institute at the Hebrew University is named &quot;The Racah Institute of Physics&quot;.

Racah&#x27;s research was mainly in the fields of quantum physics and atomic spectroscopy. He first devised a systematic general procedure for classifying the energy levels of open shell atoms, which remains to this day the accepted technique for practical calculations of atomic structure. This formalism was described in a monograph coauthored by his cousin Ugo Fano (&quot;Irreducible Tensorial Sets&quot;, 1959).

==Awards and recognition==
In 1958, Racah was awarded the Israel Prize in exact sciences.

<text>The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) is a state-federal partnership to develop and deploy national-scale cyberinfrastructure that advances research, science and engineering based in the United States. NCSA operates as a unit of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 
and provides high-performance computing resources to researchers across the country. Support for NCSA comes from the National Science Foundation,
the state of Illinois, the University of Illinois, business and industry partners, and other federal agencies.

NCSA provides leading-edge computing, data storage, and visualization resources. NCSA computational and data environment implements a multi-architecture hardware strategy, deploying both clusters and shared memory systems to support high-end users and communities on the architectures best-suited to their requirements. Nearly 1,360 scientists, engineers and students used the computing and data systems at NCSA to support research in more than 830 projects.

NCSA is led by Professor Bill Gropp.

== History ==
NCSA is one of the five original centers in the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Supercomputer Centers Program. The idea for NCSA and the four other supercomputer centers arose from the frustration of its founder, Larry Smarr, who wrote an influential paper, &quot;The Supercomputer Famine in American Universities&quot;, in 1982, after having to travel to Europe in summertime to access supercomputers and conduct his research.

Smarr wrote a proposal to address the future needs of scientific research. Seven other University of Illinois professors joined as co-principal investigators, and many others provided descriptions of what could be accomplished if the proposal were accepted. Known as the Black Proposal (after the color of its cover), it was submitted to the NSF in 1983. It met the NSF&#x27;s mandate and its contents immediately generated excitement. However, the NSF had no organization in place to support it, and the proposal itself did not contain a clearly defined home for its implementation.

The NSF established an Office of Scientific Computing in 1984 and, with strong congressional support, it announced a national competition that would fund a set of supercomputer centers like the one described in the Black Proposal. 
The result was that four supercomputer centers would be chartered (Cornell, Illinois, Princeton, and San Diego), with a fifth (Pittsburgh) added later.

The Black Proposal was approved in 1985 and marked the foundation of NCSA, with $42,751,000 in funding from 1 January 1985 through 31 December 1989. This was also noteworthy in that the NSF&#x27;s action of approving an unsolicited proposal was unprecedented. NCSA opened its doors in January 1986.

In 2007, NCSA was awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to build &quot;Blue Waters&quot;, a supercomputer capable of performing quadrillions of calculations per second, a level of performance known as petascale.

=== Black Proposal ===
The &#x27;Black Proposal&#x27; was a short, ten-page proposal for the creation of a supercomputing center that eventually led to funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create supercomputing centers, including the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. In this sense, the significant role played by the U.S. Government in funding the center, and the first widely popular web browser (NCSA&#x27;s Mosaic), cannot be denied.

The Black Proposal described the limitations on any scientific research that required computer capabilities, and it described a future world of productive scientific collaboration, centered on universal computer access, in which technical limitations on scientific research would not exist. Significantly, it expressed a clear vision of how to get from the present to the future. The proposal was titled &quot;A Center for Scientific and Engineering Supercomputing&quot;, and was ten pages long.

The proposal&#x27;s vision of the computing future were then unusual or non-existent, but elements of it are now commonplace, such as visualization, workstations, high-speed I/O, data storage, software engineering, and close collaboration with the multi-disciplinary user community.

Modern readers of the Black Proposal may gain insight into a world that no longer exists. Today&#x27;s computers are easy to use, and the web is omnipresent. Employees in high-tech endeavors are given supercomputer accounts simply because they are employees. Computers are universally available and can be used by almost anyone of any age, applicable to almost anything.

At the time the proposal was written, computers were available to almost no one. For scientists who needed computers in their research, access was difficult if available at all. The effect on research was crippling. Reading publications from that time gives no hint that scientists were required to learn the arcane technical details of whatever computer facilities were available to them, a time-consuming limitation on their research, and an exceedingly tedious distraction from their professional interests.

The implementation of the Black Proposal had a primary role in shaping the computer technology of today, and its impact on research (both scientific and otherwise) has been profound. The proposal&#x27;s description of the leading edge of scientific research may be sobering, and the limitations on computer usage at major universities may be surprising. A comprehensive list of the world&#x27;s supercomputers shows the best resources that were then available. The thrust of the proposal may seem obvious now, but was then novel.

The National Science Foundation announced funding for the supercomputer centers in 1985; The first supercomputer at NCSA came online in January 1986.

NCSA quickly came to the attention of the worldwide scientific community with the release of NCSA Telnet in 1986. A number of other tools followed, and like NCSA Telnet, all were made available to everyone at no cost. In 1993, NCSA released the Mosaic web browser, the first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in expanding the growth of the World Wide Web. NCSA Mosaic was written by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, who went on to develop the Netscape Web browser. Mosaic was later licensed to Spyglass, Inc. which provided the foundation for Internet Explorer. The server-complement was called NCSA HTTPd, which later became known as Apache HTTP Server.

Other notable contributions by NCSA were the black hole simulations supporting the development of LIGO in 1992, the tracking of Comet Hale–Bopp in 1997, the creation of a PlayStation 2 Cluster in 2003, and the monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic and creation of a COVID-19 vaccine.

== Facilities ==
Initially, NCSA&#x27;s administrative offices were in the Water Resources Building and employees were scattered across the campus. NCSA is now headquartered within its own building directly north of the Siebel Center for Computer Science, on the site of a former baseball field, Illini Field. NCSA&#x27;s supercomputers are at the National Petascale Computing Facility.
 The latest supercomputing system at NCSA today is the DeltaAI, funded by the National Science Foundation.

== Movies and visualization ==
NCSA&#x27;s visualization department is internationally well-known. Donna Cox, leader of the Advanced Visualization Laboratory at NCSA and a professor in the School of Art and Design at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and her team created visualizations for the Oscar-nominated IMAX film &quot;Cosmic Voyage&quot;, the PBS NOVA episodes &quot;Hunt for the Supertwister&quot; and &quot;Runaway Universe&quot;, as well as Discovery Channel documentaries and pieces for CNN and NBC Nightly News. Cox and NCSA worked with the American Museum of Natural History to produce high-resolution visualizations for the Hayden Planetarium&#x27;s 2000 Millennium show, &quot;Passport to the Universe&quot;, and for &quot;The Search for Life: Are We Alone?&quot; She produced visualizations for the Hayden&#x27;s &quot;Big Bang Theatre&quot; and worked with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science to produce high-resolution data-driven visualizations of terabytes of scientific data for &quot;Black Holes: The Other Side of Infinity&quot;, a digital dome program on black holes.

== Private business partners ==
Referred to as the Industrial Partners program when it began in 1986, NCSA&#x27;s collaboration with major corporations ensured that its expertise and emerging technologies would be relevant to major challenges outside of the academic world, as those challenges arose. Business partners had no control over research or the disposition of its results, but they were well-situated to be early adopters of any benefits of the research. This program is now called NCSA Industry.

<doc id="45870" wikidata="Q36202" url="?curid=45870" title="Ladin language">
<text>Ladin ( , ; autonym: ; ; ) is a Romance language of the Rhaeto-Romance subgroup, mainly spoken in the Dolomite Mountains in Northern Italy in the provinces of South Tyrol, Trentino, and Belluno, by the Ladin people. It exhibits similarities to Romansh, which is spoken in Switzerland, as well as to Friulian, which is spoken in northeast Italy.

The precise extent of the Ladin language area is a subject of scholarly debate. A narrower perspective includes only the dialects of the valleys around the Sella group, while wider definitions comprise the dialects of adjacent valleys in the Province of Belluno and even dialects spoken in the northwestern Trentino.

A standard variety of Ladin () has been developed by the Office for Ladin Language Planning as a common communication tool across the whole Ladin-speaking region.

==Geographic distribution==
Ladin is recognized as a minority language in 54 Italian municipalities belonging to the provinces of South Tyrol, Trentino and Belluno. It is not possible to assess the exact number of Ladin speakers, because only in the provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino are the inhabitants asked to identify their native language in the general census of the population, which takes place every 10 years.

=== South Tyrol ===
In the 2011 census, 20,548 inhabitants of South Tyrol declared Ladin as their native language. Ladin is an officially recognised language, taught in schools and used in public offices (in written as well as spoken forms).

The following municipalities of South Tyrol have a majority of Ladin speakers:
=== Trentino ===
In the 2011 census, 18,550 inhabitants of Trentino declared Ladin as their native language. It is prevailing in the following municipalities of Trentino in the Fassa Valley, where Ladin is recognized as a minority language:

The Nones language in the Non Valley and the related Solandro language found in the Sole Valley are Gallo-Romance languages and often grouped together into a single linguistic unit due to their similarity. They are spoken in 38 municipalities but have no official status. Their more precise classification is uncertain. Both dialects show a strong resemblance to Trentinian dialect and Eastern Lombard, and scholars debate whether they are Ladin dialects or not.

About 23% of the inhabitants from Val di Non and 1.5% from Val di Sole declared Ladin as their native language at the 2011 census. The number of Ladin speakers in those valleys amounts to 8,730, outnumbering the native speakers in the Fassa Valley. In order to stress the difference between the dialects in Non and Fassa valleys, it has been proposed to distinguish between &quot;ladins dolomitiches&quot; (Dolomitic Ladinians) and &quot;ladins nonejes&quot; (Non Valley Ladinians) at the next census.

=== Province of Belluno ===
There is no linguistic census in the Province of Belluno, but the number of Ladin speakers has been estimated using a 2006 survey. In this area, there are about 1,166 people who speak the standard Ladin and 865 who speak the dialect of Ladin, so out of 8,495 inhabitants they are the 23.9%. They live in the part of the province that was part of the County of Tyrol until 1918, comprising the communes of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo (15.6% Ladin), Colle Santa Lucia (50.6% Ladin) and Livinallongo del Col di Lana (54.3% Ladin).

The provincial administration of Belluno has enacted to identify Ladin as a minority language in additional municipalities. Those are: Agordo, Alleghe, Auronzo di Cadore, Borca di Cadore, Calalzo di Cadore, Canale d&#x27;Agordo, Cencenighe Agordino, Cibiana di Cadore, Comelico Superiore, Danta di Cadore, Domegge di Cadore, Falcade, Forno di Zoldo, Gosaldo, La Valle Agordina, Lozzo di Cadore, Ospitale di Cadore, Perarolo di Cadore, Pieve di Cadore, Rivamonte Agordino, Rocca Pietore, San Nicolò di Comelico, San Pietro di Cadore, San Tomaso Agordino, San Vito di Cadore, Santo Stefano di Cadore, Selva di Cadore, Taibon Agordino, Vallada Agordina, Valle di Cadore, Vigo di Cadore, Vodo di Cadore, Voltago Agordino, Zoldo Alto, Zoppè di Cadore. Ladinity in the province of Belluno is more ethnic than linguistic. The varieties spoken by Ladin municipalities are Venetian alpine dialects, which are grammatically no different to those spoken in municipalities that did not declare themselves as Ladin. Their language is called &quot;Ladino Bellunese&quot;.

All Ladin dialects spoken in the province of Belluno, including those in the former Tyrolean territories, enjoy a varying degree of influence from Venetian.

==History==

The name derives from Latin, because Ladin is originally a Vulgar Latin language left over from the Romanized Alps. Ladin is often attributed to be a relic of Vulgar Latin dialects associated with Rhaeto-Romance languages. Whether a proto-Rhaeto-Romance language ever existed is controversially discussed amongst linguists and historians, a debate known as . Starting in the 6th century, the Bavarii started moving in from the north, while from the south Gallo-Italic languages started pushing in, which further shrank the original extent of the Ladin area. Only in the more remote mountain valleys did Ladin survive among the isolated populations.

Starting in the very early Middle Ages, the area was mostly ruled by the County of Tyrol or the Bishopric of Brixen, both belonging to the realms of the Austrian Habsburg rulers. The area of Cadore was under the rule of the Republic of Venice. During the period of the Holy Roman Empire and, after 1804, the Austrian Empire, the Ladins underwent a process of Germanization.

After the end of World War I in 1918, Italy annexed the southern part of Tyrol, including the Ladin areas. The Italian nationalist movement of the 19th and 20th centuries regarded Ladin as an &quot;Italian dialect&quot;, a notion rejected by various Ladin exponents and associations, despite their having been counted as Italians by the Austrian authorities as well. The programme of Italianization, professed by fascists such as Ettore Tolomei and Benito Mussolini, added further pressure on the Ladin communities to subordinate their identities to Italian. This included changing Ladin place names into the Italian pronunciation according to Tolomei&#x27;s .

Following the end of World War II, the Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement of 1946 between Austria and Italy introduced a level of autonomy for Trentino and South Tyrol but did not include any provisions for the Ladin language. Only in the second autonomy statute for South Tyrol in 1972 was Ladin recognized as a partially official language.

==Status==

Ladin is officially recognised in Trentino and South Tyrol by provincial and national law. Italy signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of 1991, but it has not ratified it so far. The charter calls for minority rights to be respected and minority languages, to which Ladin belongs, to be appropriately protected and promoted. Starting in the 1990s, the Italian parliament and provincial assembly have passed laws and regulations protecting the Ladin language and culture. A cultural institute was founded to safeguard and educate in the language and culture. School curricula were adapted in order to teach in Ladin, and street signs are being changed to bilingual.

Ladin is also recognized as a protected language in the Province of Belluno in Veneto region pursuant to the Standards for Protection of Historic Language Minorities Act No. 482 (1999). In comparison with South Tyrol and Trentino, the wishes of the Ladins have barely been addressed by the regional government. In a popular referendum in October 2007, the inhabitants of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo overwhelmingly voted to leave Veneto and return to South Tyrol. The redrawing of the provincial borders would return Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Livinallongo del Col di Lana and Colle Santa Lucia to South Tyrol, to which they traditionally belonged when part of the County of Tyrol or the Bishopric of Brixen.

Although the Ladin communities are spread out over three neighbouring regions, the &quot;Union Generala di Ladins dles Dolomites&quot; is asking that they be reunited. The Ladin Autonomist Union and the Fassa Association run on a Ladin list and have sought more rights and autonomy for Ladin speakers. Ladins are also guaranteed political representations in the assemblies of Trentino and South Tyrol due to a reserved seats system.

In South Tyrol, in order to reach a fair allocation of jobs in public service, a system called &quot;ethnic proportion&quot; was established in the 1970s. Every 10 years, when the general census of population takes place, each citizen has to identify with a linguistic group. The results determine how many potential positions in public service are allocated for each linguistic group. This has theoretically enabled Ladins to receive guaranteed representation in the South Tyrolean civil service according to their numbers.

The recognition of minority languages in Italy has been criticised since the implementation of Act No. 482 (1999), especially due to alleged financial benefits. This applies also to the Ladin language, especially in the province of Belluno.

==Subdivisions==
A possible subdivision of Ladin language identifies six major groups.

===Athesian Group of the Sella===
The dialects of the Athesian group (from the river Adige Basin) of the Sella are spoken in South Tyrol:
* Gherdëina, spoken in Val Gardena by 8,148 inhabitants (80–90% of the population);
* Badiot and Maró, spoken in Val Badia and in Mareo by 9,229 people (95%), as native language.

The South Tyrolean dialects are most similar to the original Ladin.


===Trentinian Group of the Sella===
The names of the Ladin dialects spoken in the Fassa Valley in Trentino are Moenat, Brach, and Cazet. 82.8% of the inhabitants of Fassa Valley are native Ladin speakers; the Ladin language in Fassa is influenced by Trentinian dialects.

===Agordino Group of the Sella===
In the Province of Belluno the following dialects are considered as part of the Agordino group:
*Fodom, also called Livinallese, spoken in Livinallongo del Col di Lana and Colle Santa Lucia, native language of 80–90% of the people;
*Rocchesano in the area of Rocca Pietore. While Laste di Sopra (Ladin &quot;Laste de Sora&quot;) and Sottoguda (Ladin &quot;Stagùda&quot;) are predominantly Ladin, in Alleghe, San Tomaso Agordino, and Falcade so-called Ladin-Venetian dialects are spoken, with strong Venetian influence;
* Ladin in the area of Agordo and Valle del Biois, even if some regard it rather as Venetian-Ladin.

===Ampezzan Group===
Spoken in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo (&quot;Anpezo&quot;), similar to Cadorino dialect.

Even in Valle di Zoldo (from Forno-Fôr upwards) there are elements of the Ampezzan Group.

===Cadorino Group===
Spoken in Cadore and Comelico and best known as Cadorino dialect.

===Nones and Solandro Group===
In Western Trentino, in Non Valley, Val di Sole, Val di Peio, Val di Rabbi, and part of Val Rendena, detached from the Dolomitic area, dialects are spoken that are often considered to be part of the Ladin language (Anaunic Ladin), but have strong influences from Trentinian and Eastern Lombard dialects.

==Sample texts==

===Lord&#x27;s Prayer===
The first part of the &#x27;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&#x27; in Standard Ladin, Latin, and Italian for comparison, as well as other Romance languages and English:

===Common phrases===
==Phonology==
