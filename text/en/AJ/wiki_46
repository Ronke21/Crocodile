<doc id="47836" wikidata="Q39837" url="?curid=47836" title="Averroes">
<text>Ibn Rushd (; full name in ; 14 April 112611 December 1198), often Latinized as Averroes ( ), was an Andalusian polymath and jurist who wrote about many subjects, including philosophy, theology, medicine, astronomy, physics, psychology, mathematics, Islamic jurisprudence and law, and linguistics. The author of more than 100 books and treatises, his philosophical works include numerous commentaries on Aristotle, for which he was known in the Western world as &quot;The Commentator&quot; and &quot;Father of Rationalism&quot;.

Averroes was a strong proponent of Aristotelianism; he attempted to restore what he considered the original teachings of Aristotle and opposed the Neoplatonist tendencies of earlier Muslim thinkers, such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna. He also defended the pursuit of philosophy against criticism by Ashari theologians such as Al-Ghazali. Averroes argued that philosophy was permissible in Islam and even compulsory among certain elites. He also argued scriptural text should be interpreted allegorically if it appeared to contradict conclusions reached by reason and philosophy. In Islamic jurisprudence, he wrote the &quot;Bidāyat al-Mujtahid&quot; on the differences between Islamic schools of law and the principles that caused their differences. In medicine, he proposed a new theory of stroke, described the signs and symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease for the first time, and might have been the first to identify the retina as the part of the eye responsible for sensing light. His medical book &quot;Al-Kulliyat fi al-Tibb&quot;, translated into Latin and known as the &quot;Colliget&quot;, became a textbook in Europe for centuries.

His legacy in the Islamic world was modest for geographical and intellectual reasons. In the West, Averroes was known for his extensive commentaries on Aristotle, many of which were translated into Latin and Hebrew. The translations of his work reawakened western European interest in Aristotle and Greek thinkers, an area of study that had been widely abandoned after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. His thoughts generated controversies in Latin Christendom and triggered a philosophical movement called Averroism based on his writings. His unity of the intellect thesis, proposing that all humans share the same intellect, became one of the best-known and most controversial Averroist doctrines in the West. His works were condemned by the Catholic Church in 1270 and 1277. Although weakened by condemnations and sustained critique from Thomas Aquinas, Latin Averroism continued to attract followers up to the sixteenth century.

== Name ==
Ibn Rushd&#x27;s full, transliterated Arabic name is &quot;Abū l-Walīd Muḥammad ibn ʾAḥmad Ibn Rushd&quot;. Sometimes, the nickname &quot;al-Hafid&quot; (&quot;The Grandson&quot;) is appended to his name, to distinguish him from his grandfather, a famous judge and jurist. &quot;Averroes&quot; is the Medieval Latin form of &quot;Ibn Rushd&quot;; it was derived from the Spanish pronunciation of the original Arabic name, wherein &quot;Ibn&quot; becomes &quot;Aben&quot; or &quot;Aven&quot;. Other forms of the name in European languages include &quot;Ibin-Ros-din&quot;, &quot;Filius Rosadis&quot;, &quot;Ibn-Rusid&quot;, &quot;Ben-Raxid&quot;, &quot;Ibn-Ruschod&quot;, &quot;Den-Resched&quot;, &quot;Aben-Rassad&quot;, &quot;Aben-Rasd&quot;, &quot;Aben-Rust&quot;, &quot;Avenrosdy&quot;, &quot;Avenryz&quot;, &quot;Adveroys&quot;, &quot;Benroist&quot;, &quot;Avenroyth&quot; and &quot;Averroysta&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Little is known about Averroes&#x27;s early life. Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Rushd was born on 14 April 1126 (520 AH) in Córdoba. His family was well known in the city for their public service, especially in the legal and religious fields. He was probably of Muladí and Berber ancestry. His grandfather Abu al-Walid Muhammad (d. 1126) was the chief judge (&quot;qadi&quot;) of Córdoba and the imam of the Great Mosque of Córdoba under the Almoravids. His father Abu al-Qasim Ahmad was not as celebrated as his grandfather, but was also chief judge until the Almoravids were replaced by the Almohads in 1146.

According to his traditional biographers, Averroes&#x27;s education was &quot;excellent&quot;, beginning with studies in hadith (traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), &quot;fiqh&quot; (jurisprudence), medicine and theology. He learned Maliki jurisprudence under al-Hafiz Abu Muhammad ibn Rizq and hadith with Ibn Bashkuwal, a student of his grandfather. His father also taught him about jurisprudence, including on Imam Malik&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; the &quot;Muwatta&quot;, which Averroes went on to memorize. He studied medicine under Abu Jafar Jarim al-Tajail, who probably taught him philosophy too. He also knew the works of the philosopher Ibn Bajjah (also known as Avempace), and might have known him personally or been tutored by him. He joined a regular meeting of philosophers, physicians and poets in Seville which was attended by philosophers Ibn Tufayl and Ibn Zuhr as well as the future caliph Abu Yusuf Yaqub. He also studied the &quot;kalam&quot; theology of the Ashari school, which he criticized later in life. His 13th-century biographer Ibn al-Abbar said he was more interested in the study of law and its principles (&quot;usul&quot;) than that of hadith and he was especially competent in the field of &quot;khilaf&quot; (disputes and controversies in the Islamic jurisprudence). Ibn al-Abbar also mentioned his interests in &quot;the sciences of the ancients&quot;, probably in reference to Greek philosophy and sciences.

=== Career ===
By 1153 Averroes was in Marrakesh, the capital of the Almohad Caliphate (now in Morocco), to perform astronomical observations and to support the Almohad project of building new colleges. He was hoping to find physical laws of astronomical movements instead of only the mathematical laws known at the time but this research was unsuccessful. During his stay in Marrakesh, he likely met ibn Tufayl, a renowned philosopher and the author of &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot; who was also the court physician in Marrakesh. Averroes and ibn Tufayl became friends despite the differences in their philosophies.

In 1169, ibn Tufayl introduced Averroes to the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf. In a famous account reported by historian &#x27;Abd al-Wahid al-Marrakushi, the caliph asked Averroes whether the heavens had existed since eternity or had a beginning. Knowing this question was controversial and worried a wrong answer could put him in danger, Averroes did not answer. The caliph then elaborated the views of Plato, Aristotle and Muslim philosophers on the topic and discussed them with Ibn Tufayl. This display of knowledge put Averroes at ease; Averroes then explained his views on the subject, which impressed the caliph. Averroes was similarly impressed by Abu Yaqub and later said the caliph had &quot;a profuseness of learning I did not suspect&quot;.

After their introduction, Averroes remained in Abu Yaqub&#x27;s favor until the caliph died in 1184. When the caliph complained to Ibn Tufayl about the difficulty of understanding Aristotle&#x27;s work, Ibn Tufayl recommended to the caliph that Averroes work on explaining it. This was the beginning of Averroes&#x27;s massive commentaries on Aristotle; his first works on the subject were written in 1169.

In the same year, Averroes was appointed &quot;qadi&quot; (judge) in Seville. In 1171 he became &quot;qadi&quot; in his hometown of Córdoba. As &quot;qadi&quot; he would decide cases and give &quot;fatwa&quot;s (legal opinions) based on religious law. The writing rate increased during this time despite other obligations and his travels within the Almohad empire. He also took the opportunity from his travels to conduct astronomical research. Many of his works produced between 1169 and 1179 were dated in Seville rather than Córdoba. In 1179 he was again appointed &quot;qadi&quot; in Seville. In 1182, he succeeded his friend Ibn Tufayl as court physician. Later the same year, he was appointed chief qadi of Córdoba, then controlled by the Taifa of Seville, a prestigious office that his grandfather had once held.

In 1184 Caliph Abu Yaqub died and was succeeded by Abu Yusuf Yaqub. Initially, Averroes remained in royal favour, but in 1195, his fortune reversed. Various charges were made against him, and a tribunal in Córdoba tried him. The tribunal condemned his teachings, ordered the burning of his works and banished Averroes to nearby Lucena. Early biographers&#x27; reasons for this fall from grace include a possible insult to the caliph in his writings but modern scholars attribute it to political reasons. The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; said the caliph distanced himself from Averroes to gain support from more orthodox &quot;ulema&quot;, who opposed Averroes and whose support al-Mansur needed for his war against Christian kingdoms. Historian of Islamic philosophy Majid Fakhry also wrote that public pressure from traditional Maliki jurists who were opposed to Averroes played a role.

After a few years, Averroes returned to court in Marrakesh and was again in the caliph&#x27;s favor. He died shortly afterwards, on 11 December 1198 (9 Safar 595 in the Islamic calendar). He was initially buried in North Africa. His body was later moved to Córdoba for another funeral, at which future Sufi mystic and philosopher ibn Arabi (1165–1240) was present.

== Works ==

Averroes was a prolific writer and his works, according to Fakhry, &quot;covered a greater variety of subjects&quot; than those of any of his predecessors in the East, including philosophy, medicine, jurisprudence or legal theory, and linguistics. Most of his writings were commentaries on or paraphrasings of the works of Aristotle that—especially the long ones—often contain his original thoughts. According to French author Ernest Renan, Averroes wrote at least 67 original works, including 28 works on philosophy, 20 on medicine, 8 on law, 5 on theology, and 4 on grammar, in addition to his commentaries on most of Aristotle&#x27;s works and his commentary on Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Republic&quot;. Many of Averroes&#x27;s works in Arabic did not survive, but their translations into Hebrew or Latin did. For example, of his long commentaries on Aristotle, only &quot;a tiny handful of Arabic manuscript remains&quot;.

=== Commentaries on Aristotle ===
Averroes wrote commentaries on nearly all of Aristotle&#x27;s surviving works. The only exception is &quot;Politics&quot;, which he did not have access to, so he wrote commentaries on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. He classified his commentaries into three categories that modern scholars have named &quot;short&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;long&quot; commentaries. Most of the short commentaries (&quot;jami&quot;) were written early in his career and contain summaries of Aristotlean doctrines. The middle commentaries (&quot;talkhis&quot;) contain paraphrases that clarify and simplify Aristotle&#x27;s original text. The middle commentaries were probably written in response to his patron caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf&#x27;s complaints about the difficulty of understanding Aristotle&#x27;s original texts and to help others in a similar position. The long commentaries (&quot;tafsir&quot; or &quot;sharh&quot;), or line-by-line commentaries, include the complete text of the original works with a detailed analysis of each line. The long commentaries are very detailed and contain a high degree of original thought, and were unlikely to be intended for a general audience. Only five of Aristotle&#x27;s works had all three types of commentaries: &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, &quot;On the Soul&quot;, &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, and &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;.

=== Stand-alone philosophical works ===
Averroes also wrote stand-alone philosophical treatises, including &quot;On the Intellect&quot;, &quot;On the Syllogism&quot;, &quot;On Conjunction with the Active Intellect&quot;, &quot;On Time&quot;, &quot;On the Heavenly Sphere&quot; and &quot;On the Motion of the Sphere&quot;. He also wrote several polemics: &quot;Essay on al-Farabi&#x27;s Approach to Logic, as Compared to that of Aristotle&quot;, &quot;Metaphysical Questions Dealt with in the Book of Healing by Ibn Sina&quot;, and &quot;Rebuttal of Ibn Sina&#x27;s Classification of Existing Entities&quot;.

=== Islamic theology ===
Scholarly sources, including Fakhry and the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;, have named three works Averroes&#x27;s critical writings in this area. &quot;Fasl al-Maqal&quot; (&quot;The Decisive Treatise&quot;) is an 1178 treatise that argues for the compatibility of Islam and philosophy. &quot;Al-Kashf &#x27;an Manahij al-Adillah&quot; (&quot;Exposition of the Methods of Proof&quot;), written in 1179, criticizes the theologies of the Ash&#x27;arites, and lays out Averroes&#x27;s argument for proving the existence of God, as well as his thoughts on God&#x27;s attributes and actions. The 1180 &quot;Tahafut at-Tahafut&quot; (&quot;Incoherence of the Incoherence&quot;) is a rebuttal of al-Ghazali&#x27;s (d. 1111) landmark criticism of philosophy &quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;. It combines ideas in his commentaries and stand-alone works and uses them to respond to al-Ghazali. The work also criticizes Avicenna and his neoplatonist tendencies, sometimes agreeing with al-Ghazali&#x27;s critique against him.

=== Medicine ===

Averroes, who served as the royal physician at the Almohad court, wrote a number of medical treatises. The most famous was &quot;al-Kulliyat fi al-Tibb&quot; (&quot;The General Principles of Medicine&quot;, Latinized in the west as the &quot;Colliget&quot;), written around 1162, before his appointment at court. The title of this book is the opposite of &quot;al-Juz&#x27;iyyat fi al-Tibb&quot; (&quot;The Specificities of Medicine&quot;), written by his friend Ibn Zuhr, and the two collaborated intending that their works complement each other. The Latin translation of the &quot;Colliget&quot; became a medical textbook in Europe for centuries. His other surviving titles include &quot;On Treacle&quot;, &quot;The Differences in Temperament&quot;, and &quot;Medicinal Herbs&quot;. He also wrote summaries of the works of Greek physician Galen (died 210) and a commentary on Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;Urjuzah fi al-Tibb&quot; (&quot;Poem on Medicine&quot;).

=== Jurisprudence and law ===
Averroes served multiple tenures as judge and produced multiple works in the fields of Islamic jurisprudence or legal theory. The only book that survives today is &quot;Bidāyat al-Mujtahid wa Nihāyat al-Muqtaṣid&quot; (&quot;Primer of the Discretionary Scholar&quot;). In this work he explains the differences of opinion (&quot;ikhtilaf&quot;) between the Sunni &quot;madhhabs&quot; (schools of Islamic jurisprudence) both in practice and in their underlying juristic principles, as well as the reason why they are inevitable. Despite his status as a Maliki judge, the book also discusses the opinion of other schools, including liberal and conservative ones. Other than this surviving text, bibliographical information shows he wrote a summary of Al-Ghazali&#x27;s &quot;On Legal Theory of Muslim Jurisprudence&quot; (&quot;Al-Mustasfa&quot;) and tracts on sacrifices and land tax.

== Philosophical ideas ==
=== Aristotelianism in the Islamic philosophical tradition ===
In his philosophical writings, Averroes attempted to return to Aristotelianism, which according to him had been distorted by the Neoplatonist tendencies of Muslim philosophers such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna. He rejected al-Farabi&#x27;s attempt to merge the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, pointing out the differences between the two, such as Aristotle&#x27;s rejection of Plato&#x27;s theory of ideas. He also criticized Al-Farabi&#x27;s works on logic for misinterpreting its Aristotelian source. He wrote an extensive critique of Avicenna, who was the standard-bearer of Islamic Neoplatonism in the Middle Ages. He argued that Avicenna&#x27;s theory of emanation had many fallacies and was not found in the works of Aristotle. Averroes disagreed with Avicenna&#x27;s view that existence is merely an accident added to essence, arguing the reverse; something exists &quot;per se&quot; and essence can only be found by subsequent abstraction. He also rejected Avicenna&#x27;s modality and Avicenna&#x27;s argument to prove the existence of God as the Necessary Existent.

Averroes felt strongly about the incorporation of Greek thought into the Muslim world, and wrote that &quot;if before us someone has inquired into [wisdom], it behooves us to seek help from what he has said. It is irrelevant whether he belongs to our community or to another&quot;.

=== Relation between religion and philosophy ===

During Averroes&#x27;s lifetime, philosophy came under attack from the Sunni tradition, especially from theological schools like the Hanbali school and the Ashʾarites. In particular, the Ashʾari scholar al-Ghazali (1058–1111) wrote &quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;, a scathing and influential critique of the Neoplatonic philosophical tradition in the Islamic world and against the works of Avicenna in particular. Among others, Al-Ghazali charged philosophers with non-belief in Islam and sought to disprove the teaching of the philosophers using logical arguments.

In &quot;Decisive Treatise&quot;, Averroes argues that philosophy—which for him represented conclusions reached using reason and careful method—cannot contradict revelations in Islam because they are just two different methods of reaching the truth, and &quot;truth cannot contradict truth&quot;. When conclusions reached by philosophy appear to contradict the text of the revelation, then according to Averroes, revelation must be subjected to interpretation or allegorical understanding to remove the contradiction. This interpretation must be done by those &quot;rooted in knowledge&quot;—a phrase taken from surah Āl Imrān 3:7 of the Quran, which for Averroes refers to philosophers who during his lifetime had access to the &quot;highest methods of knowledge&quot;. He also argues that the Quran calls for Muslims to study philosophy because the study and reflection of nature would increase a person&#x27;s knowledge of &quot;the Artisan&quot; (God). He quotes Quranic passages calling Muslims to reflect on nature. He uses them to render a fatwa that philosophy is allowed for Muslims and is probably an obligation, at least among those who have the talent for it.

Averroes also distinguishes between three modes of discourse: the rhetorical (based on persuasion) accessible to the common masses; the dialectical (based on debate) and often employed by theologians and the ulama (religious scholars); and the demonstrative (based on logical deduction). According to Averroes, the Quran uses the rhetorical method of inviting people to the truth, which allows it to reach the common masses with its persuasiveness, whereas philosophy uses the demonstrative methods that were only available to the learned but provided the best possible understanding and knowledge.

Averroes also tries to deflect Al-Ghazali&#x27;s criticisms of philosophy by saying that many of them apply only to the philosophy of Avicenna and not to that of Aristotle, which Averroes argues to be the true philosophy from which Avicenna has deviated.

=== Nature of God ===
==== Existence ====
Averroes lays out his views on the existence and nature of God in the treatise &quot;The Exposition of the Methods of Proof&quot;. He examines and critiques the doctrines of four sects of Islam: the Asharites, the Mutazilites, the Sufis and those he calls the &quot;literalists&quot; (&quot;al-hashwiyah&quot;). Among other things, he examines their proofs of God&#x27;s existence and critiques each one. Averroes argues that there are two arguments for God&#x27;s existence that he deems logically sound and in accordance to the Quran; the arguments from &quot;providence&quot; and &quot;from invention&quot;. The providence argument considers that the world and the universe seem finely tuned to support human life. Averroes cited the sun, the moon, the rivers, the seas and the location of humans on the earth. According to him, this suggests a creator who created them for the welfare of mankind. The argument from invention contends that worldly entities such as animals and plants appear to have been invented. Therefore, Averroes argues that a designer was behind the creation and that is God. Averroes&#x27;s two arguments are teleological in nature and not cosmological like the arguments of Aristotle and most contemporaneous Muslim kalam theologians.

==== God&#x27;s attributes ====
Averroes upholds the doctrine of divine unity (&quot;tawhid&quot;) and argues that God has seven divine attributes: knowledge, life, power, will, hearing, vision and speech. He devotes the most attention to the attribute of knowledge and argues that divine knowledge differs from human knowledge because God knows the universe because God is its cause while humans only know the universe through its effects.

Averroes argues that the attribute of life can be inferred because it is the precondition of knowledge and also because God willed objects into being. Power can be inferred by God&#x27;s ability to bring creations into existence. Averroes also argues that knowledge and power inevitably give rise to speech. Regarding vision and speech, he says that because God created the world, he necessarily knows every part of it in the same way an artist understands his or her work intimately. Because two elements of the world are the visual and the auditory, God must necessarily possess vision and speech.

The omnipotence paradox was first addressed by Averroes and only later by Thomas Aquinas.

=== Pre-eternity of the world ===

In the centuries preceding Averroes, there had been a debate between Muslim thinkers questioning whether the world was created at a specific moment in time or whether it has always existed. Neo-Platonic philosophers such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna argued the world has always existed. This view was criticized by the mutakallimin (philosophers and theologians) of the Ashʾari tradition; in particular, al-Ghazali wrote an extensive refutation of the pre-eternity doctrine in his &quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot; and accused the Neoplatonists of unbelief (&quot;kufr&quot;).

Averroes responded to Al-Ghazali in his &quot;Incoherence of the Incoherence&quot;. He argued first that the differences between the two positions were not vast enough to warrant the charge of unbelief. He also said the pre-eternity doctrine did not necessarily contradict the Quran and cited verses that mention pre-existing &quot;throne&quot; and &quot;water&quot; in passages related to creation. Averroes argued that a careful reading of the Quran implied only the &quot;form&quot; of the universe was created in time but that its existence has been eternal. Averroes further criticized the mutakallimin for using their interpretations of scripture to answer questions that should have been left to philosophers.

=== Politics ===
Averroes states his political philosophy in his commentary of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. He combines his ideas with Plato&#x27;s and with Islamic tradition; he considers the ideal state to be one based on the Islamic law (&quot;shariah&quot;). His interpretation of Plato&#x27;s philosopher-king followed that of Al-Farabi, which equates the philosopher-king with the imam, caliph and lawgiver of the state. Averroes&#x27;s description of the characteristics of a philosopher-king are similar to those given by Al-Farabi; they include love of knowledge, good memory, love of learning, love of truth, dislike for sensual pleasures, dislike for amassing wealth, magnanimity, courage, steadfastness, eloquence and the ability to &quot;light quickly on the middle term&quot;. Averroes writes that if philosophers cannot rule—as was the case in the Almoravid and Almohad empires around his lifetime—philosophers must still try to influence the rulers towards implementing the ideal state.

According to Averroes, there are two methods of teaching virtue to citizens; persuasion and coercion. Persuasion is the more natural method consisting of rhetorical, dialectical and demonstrative methods; sometimes, however, coercion is necessary for those not amenable to persuasion, e.g. enemies of the state. Therefore, he justifies war as a last resort, which he also supports using Quranic arguments. Consequently, he argues that a ruler should have both wisdom and courage, which are needed for governance and defense of the state.

Like Plato, Averroes calls for women to share with men in the administration of the state, including participating as soldiers, philosophers and rulers. He regrets that contemporaneous Muslim societies limited the public role of women; he says this limitation is harmful to the state&#x27;s well-being.

Averroes also accepted Plato&#x27;s ideas of the deterioration of the ideal state. He cites examples from Islamic history when the Rashidun caliphate—which in Sunni tradition represented the ideal state led by &quot;rightly guided caliphs&quot;—became a dynastic state under Muawiyah, founder of the Umayyad dynasty. He also says the Almoravid and the Almohad empires started as ideal, shariah-based states but then deteriorated into timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny.

=== Diversity of Islamic law ===
In his tenure as judge and jurist, Averroes for the most part ruled and gave fatwas according to the Maliki school of Islamic law which was dominant in Al-Andalus and the western Islamic world during his time. However, he frequently acted as &quot;his own man&quot;, including sometimes rejecting the &quot;consensus of the people of Medina&quot; argument that is one of the traditional Maliki position. In &quot;Bidāyat al-Mujtahid&quot;, one of his major contributions to the field of Islamic law, he not only describes the differences between various school of Islamic laws but also tries to theoretically explain the reasons for the difference and why they are inevitable. Even though all the schools of Islamic law are ultimately rooted in the Quran and hadith, there are &quot;causes that necessitate differences&quot; (&quot;al-asbab al-lati awjabat al-ikhtilaf&quot;). They include differences in interpreting scripture in a general or specific sense, in interpreting scriptural commands as obligatory or merely recommended, or prohibitions as discouragement or total prohibition, as well as ambiguities in the meaning of words or expressions. Averroes also writes that the application of &quot;qiyas&quot; (reasoning by analogy) could give rise to different legal opinion because jurists might disagree on the applicability of certain analogies and different analogies might contradict each other.

== Natural philosophy ==
=== Astronomy ===
As did Avempace and Ibn Tufail, Averroes criticizes the Ptolemaic system using philosophical arguments and rejects the use of eccentrics and epicycles to explain the apparent motions of the Moon, the Sun and the planets. He argued that those objects move uniformly in a strictly circular motion around the Earth, following Aristotelian principles. He postulates that there are three type of planetary motions; those that can be seen with the naked eye, those that requires instruments to observe and those that can only be known by philosophical reasoning. Averroes argues that the occasional opaque colors of the Moon are caused by variations in its thickness; the thicker parts receive more light from the Sun—and therefore emit more light—than the thinner parts. This explanation was used up to the seventeenth century by the European Scholastics to account for Galileo&#x27;s observations of spots on the Moon&#x27;s surface, until the Scholastics such as Antoine Goudin in 1668 conceded that the observation was more likely caused by mountains on the Moon. He and Ibn Bajja observed sunspots, which they thought were transits of Venus and Mercury between the Sun and the Earth. In 1153 he conducted astronomical observations in Marrakesh, where he observed the star Canopus (Arabic: &quot;Suhayl&quot;) which was invisible in the latitude of his native Spain. He used this observation to support Aristotle&#x27;s argument for the spherical Earth.

Averroes was aware that Arabic and Andalusian astronomers of his time focused on &quot;mathematical&quot; astronomy, which enabled accurate predictions through calculations but did not provide a detailed physical explanation of how the universe worked. According to him, &quot;the astronomy of our time offers no truth, but only agrees with the calculations and not with what exists.&quot; He attempted to reform astronomy to be reconciled with physics, especially the physics of Aristotle. His long commentary of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot; describes the principles of his attempted reform, but later in his life he declared that his attempts had failed. He confessed that he had not enough time or knowledge to reconcile the observed planetary motions with Aristotelian principles. In addition, he did not know the works of Eudoxus and Callippus, and so he missed the context of some of Aristotle&#x27;s astronomical works. However, his works influenced astronomer Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji (d. 1204) who adopted most of his reform principles and did succeed in proposing an early astronomical system based on Aristotelian physics.

=== Physics ===
In physics, Averroes did not adopt the inductive method that was being developed by Al-Biruni in the Islamic world and is closer to today&#x27;s physics. Rather, he was—in the words of historian of science Ruth Glasner—an &quot;exegetical&quot; scientist who produced new theses about nature through discussions of previous texts, especially the writings of Aristotle. because of this approach, he was often depicted as an unimaginative follower of Aristotle, but Glasner argues that Averroes&#x27;s work introduced highly original theories of physics, especially his elaboration of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;minima naturalia&quot; and on motion as &quot;forma fluens&quot;, which were taken up in the west and are important to the overall development of physics.

=== Psychology ===
Averroes expounds his thoughts on psychology in his three commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On the Soul&quot;. Averroes is interested in explaining the human intellect using philosophical methods and by interpreting Aristotle&#x27;s ideas. His position on the topic changed throughout his career as his thoughts developed. In his short commentary, the first of the three works, Averroes follows Ibn Bajja&#x27;s theory that something called the &quot;material intellect&quot; stores specific images that a person encounters. These images serve as basis for the &quot;unification&quot; by the universal &quot;agent intellect&quot;, which, once it happens, allow a person to gain universal knowledge about that concept. In his middle commentary, Averroes moves towards the ideas of Al-Farabi and Avicenna, saying the agent intellect gives humans the power of universal understanding, which is the material intellect. Once the person has sufficient empirical encounters with a certain concept, the power activates and gives the person universal knowledge (see also logical induction).

In his last commentary—called the &quot;Long Commentary&quot;—he proposes another theory, which becomes known as the theory of &quot;the unity of the intellect&quot;. In it, Averroes argues that there is only one material intellect, which is the same for all humans and is unmixed with human body. To explain how different individuals can have different thoughts, he uses a concept he calls &quot;fikr&quot;—known as &quot;cogitatio&quot; in Latin—a process that happens in human brains and contains not universal knowledge but &quot;active consideration of particular things&quot; the person has encountered. This theory attracted controversy when Averroes&#x27;s works entered Christian Europe; in 1229 Thomas Aquinas wrote a detailed critique titled &quot;On the Unity of the Intellect against the Averroists&quot;.

=== Medicine ===

While his works in medicine indicate an in-depth theoretical knowledge in medicine of his time, he likely had limited expertise as a practitioner, and declared in one of his works that he had not &quot;practiced much apart from myself, my relatives or my friends.&quot; He did serve as a royal physician, but his qualification and education was mostly theoretical. For the most part, Averroes&#x27;s medical work &quot;Al-Kulliyat fi al-Tibb&quot; follows the medical doctrine of Galen, an influential Greek physician and author from the second century, which was based on the four humors—blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm, whose balance is necessary for the health of the human body. Averroes&#x27;s original contributions include his observations on the retina: he might have been the first to recognize that retina was the part of the eye responsible for sensing light, rather than the lens as was commonly thought. Modern scholars dispute whether this is what he meant it his &quot;Kulliyat&quot;, but Averroes also stated a similar observation in his commentary to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Sense and Sensibilia&quot;: &quot;the innermost of the coats of the eye [the retina] must necessarily receive the light from the humors of the eye [the lens], just like the humors receive the light from air.&quot;

Another of his departure from Galen and the medical theories of the time is his description of stroke as produced by the brain and caused by an obstruction of the arteries from the heart to the brain. This explanation is closer to the modern understanding of the disease compared to that of Galen, which attributes it to the obstruction between heart and the periphery. He was also the first to describe the signs and symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in his &quot;Kulliyat&quot;, although he did not give the disease a name.

== Legacy ==
=== In Jewish tradition ===
Maimonides (d. 1204) was among early Jewish scholars who received Averroes&#x27;s works enthusiastically, saying he &quot;received lately everything Averroes had written on the works of Aristotle&quot; and that Averroes &quot;was extremely right&quot;. Thirteenth-century Jewish writers, including Samuel ibn Tibbon in his work &quot;Opinion of the Philosophers&quot;, Judah ben Solomon ha-Kohen in his &quot;Search for Wisdom&quot; and Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera, relied heavily on Averroes&#x27;s texts. In 1232, Joseph Ibn Kaspi translated Averroes&#x27;s commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Organon&quot;; this was the first Jewish translation of a complete work. In 1260 Moses ibn Tibbon published the translation of almost all of Averroes&#x27;s commentaries and some of his medical works. Jewish Averroism peaked in the fourteenth century; Jewish writers of this time who translated or were influenced by Averroes include Kalonymus ben Kalonymus of Arles, France, Todros Todrosi of Arles, Elia del Medigo of Candia and Gersonides of Languedoc.

=== In Latin tradition ===
Averroes&#x27;s main influence on the Christian West was through his extensive commentaries on Aristotle. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, western Europe fell into a cultural decline that resulted in the loss of nearly all of the intellectual legacy of the Classical Greek scholars, including Aristotle. Averroes&#x27;s commentaries, which were translated into Latin and entered western Europe in the thirteenth century, provided an expert account of Aristotle&#x27;s legacy and made them available again. The influence of his commentaries led to Averroes being referred to simply as &quot;The Commentator&quot; rather than by name in Latin Christian writings. He has been sometimes described as the &quot;father of free thought and unbelief&quot; and &quot;father of rationalism&quot;.

Michael Scot (1175 – 1232) was the first Latin translator of Averroes who translated the long commentaries of &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, &quot;On the Soul&quot; and &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, as well as multiple middle and short commentaries, starting in 1217 in Paris and Toledo. Following this, European authors such as Hermannus Alemannus, William de Luna and Armengaud of Montpellier translated Averroes&#x27;s other works, sometimes with help from Jewish authors. Soon after, Averroes&#x27;s works propagated among Christian scholars in the scholastic tradition. His writing attracted a strong circle of followers known as the Latin Averroists. Paris and Padua were major centers of Latin Averroism, and its prominent thirteenth-century leaders included Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia.

Authorities of the Roman Catholic Church reacted against the spread of Averroism. In 1270, the Bishop of Paris Étienne Tempier issued a condemnation against 15 doctrines—many of which were Aristotelian or Averroist—that he said were in conflict with the doctrines of the church. In 1277, at the request of Pope John XXI, Tempier issued another condemnation, this time targeting 219 theses drawn from many sources, mainly the teachings of Aristotle and Averroes.
Averroes received a mixed reception from other Catholic thinkers; Thomas Aquinas, a leading Catholic thinker of the thirteenth century, relied extensively on Averroes&#x27;s interpretation of Aristotle but disagreed with him on many points. For example, he wrote a detailed attack on Averroes&#x27;s theory that all humans share the same intellect. He also opposed Averroes on the eternity of the universe and divine providence. Ramon Llull opposed Averroism and established a distinction between a religion that could be tolerated—Islam—and a philosophy that should be opposed—Averroism, especially in its Latin version.

The Catholic Church&#x27;s condemnations of 1270 and 1277, and the detailed critique by Aquinas weakened the spread of Averroism in Latin Christendom, though it maintained a following until the sixteenth century, when European thought began to diverge from Aristotelianism. Leading Averroists in the following centuries included John of Jandun and Marsilius of Padua (fourteenth century), Gaetano da Thiene and Pietro Pomponazzi (fifteenth century), and Agostino Nifo and Marcantonio Zimara (sixteenth century).

=== In Islamic tradition ===
Averroes had no major influence on Islamic philosophic thought until modern times. Part of the reason was geography; Averroes lived in Spain, the extreme west of the Islamic civilization far from the centers of Islamic intellectual traditions. Also, his philosophy may not have appealed to Islamic scholars of his time. His focus on Aristotle&#x27;s works was outdated in the twelfth-century Muslim world, which had already scrutinized Aristotle since the ninth century and by now was engaging deeply with newer schools of thought, especially that of Avicenna. In the nineteenth century, Muslim thinkers began to engage with the works of Averroes again. By this time, there was a cultural renaissance called &quot;Al-Nahda&quot; (&quot;reawakening&quot;) in the Arabic-speaking world and the works of Averroes were seen as inspiration to modernize the Muslim intellectual tradition.

== Cultural references ==
References to Averroes appear in the popular culture of both the western and Muslim world. The poem &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; by the Italian writer Dante Alighieri, completed in 1320, depicts Averroes, &quot;who made the Great Commentary&quot;, along with other non-Christian Greek and Muslim thinkers, in the first circle of hell around Saladin. The prologue of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (1387) by Geoffrey Chaucer lists Averroes among other medical authorities known in Europe at the time. Averroes is depicted in Raphael&#x27;s 1501 fresco &quot;The School of Athens&quot; that decorates the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, which features seminal figures of philosophy. In the painting, Averroes wears a green robe and a turban, and peers out from behind Pythagoras, who is shown writing a book.

Averroes is referenced briefly in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (written 1831, but set in the Paris of 1482). The novel&#x27;s villain, the Priest Claude Frollo, extols Averroes&#x27; talents as an alchemist in his obsessive quest to find the Philosophers Stone.

A 1947 short story by Jorge Luis Borges, &quot;Averroes&#x27;s Search&quot; (), features his attempts to understand Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; within a culture that lacks a tradition of live theatrical performance. In the afterwords of the story, Borges comments, &quot;I felt that [the story] mocked me, foiled me, thwarted me. I felt that Averroës, trying to imagine what a play is without ever having suspected what a theater is, was no more absurd than I, trying to imagine Averroës yet with no more material than a few snatches from Renan, Lane, and Asín Palacios.&quot; Averroes is also the hero of the 1997 Egyptian movie &quot;Destiny&quot; by Youssef Chahine, made partly in commemoration of the 800th anniversary of his death. The plant genus &quot;Averrhoa&quot; (whose members include the starfruit and the bilimbi), the lunar crater ibn Rushd, and the asteroid 8318 Averroes are named after him.

Mael Malihabadi&#x27;s 1957 Urdu historical fiction novel &quot;Falsafi ibn-e Rushd&quot; revolves around his life.

<text>The Arabian Peninsula (; , , &quot;Arabian Peninsula&quot; or , , ), or Arabia, is a peninsula in West Asia, situated northeast of Africa on the Arabian Plate. At , comparable in size to India, the Arabian Peninsula is the largest peninsula in the world.

Geographically, the Arabian Peninsula includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen, as well as southern Iraq and Jordan. The largest of these is Saudi Arabia. In the Roman era, the Sinai Peninsula was also considered a part of Arabia.

The Arabian Peninsula formed as a result of the rifting of the Red Sea between 56 and 23 million years ago, and is bordered by the Red Sea to the west and southwest, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman to the northeast, the Levant and Mesopotamia to the north and the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean to the southeast. The peninsula plays a critical geopolitical role in the Arab world and globally due to its vast reserves of oil and natural gas.

Before the modern era, the region was divided into primarily four distinct regions: the Central Plateau (Najd and Al-Yamama), South Arabia (Yemen, Hadhramaut and south-western Oman), Al-Bahrain (Eastern Arabia or Al-Hassa), and the Hejaz (Tihamah for the western coast), as described by Ibn al-Faqih.

==Etymology==

In antiquity, the term &quot;Arabia&quot; encompassed a larger area than the current term &quot;Arabian Peninsula&quot; and included the Arabian desert and large parts of the Syrian-Arabian desert. During the Hellenistic period, the area was known as &quot;Arabia&quot; (). The Romans named three regions &quot;Arabia&quot;: 
* Arabia Petraea (): it consisted of the former Nabataean Kingdom in the southern Levant, the Sinai Peninsula and northwestern Arabian Peninsula. It was the only one that became a province, with Petra (in Jordan) as its capital.
* Arabia Deserta (): signified the desert lands of Arabia. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in Charles M. Doughty&#x27;s &quot;Travels in Arabia Deserta&quot; (1888).
* Arabia Felix (): was used by geographers to describe the southern part of the Arabian peninsula, mostly what is now Yemen, which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.

One of the nomes of Ptolemaic Egypt was named &quot;Arabia&quot;.

Arabians used a north–south division of Arabia: &quot;ash-Sham&quot; vs. &quot;al-Yaman&quot;, or &quot;Arabia Deserta&quot; vs. &quot;Arabia Felix&quot;. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.

The Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived &#x27;the land of the Arabs&#x27; – Bilad al-&#x27;Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Levant), bilad al-Yaman (Yemen), and Bilad al-&#x27;Iraq (Iraq). The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from Cilicia, where the Euphrates river makes its descent into Syria, through Palestine, and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.

&quot;The provinces of Arabia were:&quot; Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hejaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.

==Geography==
The Arabian Peninsula is located in the continent of Asia and is bounded by (clockwise) the Persian Gulf on the northeast, the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman on the east, the Arabian Sea on the southeast, the Gulf of Aden, and the Guardafui Channel on the south, and the Bab-el-Mandeb strait on the southwest and the Red Sea, which is located on the southwest and west. The northern portion of the peninsula merges with the Syrian Desert with no clear borderline, although the northern boundary of the peninsula is generally considered to be the northern borders of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, also southern regions of Iraq and Jordan.

The most prominent feature of the peninsula is desert, but in the southwest, there are mountain ranges, which receive greater rainfall than the rest of the peninsula. Harrat ash Shaam is a large volcanic field that extends from northwestern Arabia into Jordan and southern Syria.

===Political boundaries===
The Peninsula&#x27;s constituent countries are (clockwise from north to south) Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the east, Oman on the southeast, Yemen on the south, and Saudi Arabia at the center. The island country of Bahrain lies just off the east coast of the Peninsula. Due to Yemen&#x27;s jurisdiction over the Socotra Archipelago, the Peninsula&#x27;s geopolitical outline faces the Guardafui Channel and the Somali Sea to the south.

The six countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE form the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia covers the greater part of the Peninsula. The Peninsula contains the world&#x27;s largest reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are economically the wealthiest in the region. Qatar, the only peninsular country in the Persian Gulf on the larger peninsula, is home to the Arabic-language television station Al Jazeera and its English-language subsidiary Al Jazeera English. Kuwait, on the border with Iraq, is an important country strategically, forming one of the main staging grounds for coalition forces mounting the United States–led 2003 invasion of Iraq.

===Population===

Despite its historically sparse population, political Arabia stands out for its rapid population growth, driven by both significant inflows of migrant labor and persistently high birth rates. The population is characterized by its relative youth and a heavily skewed gender ratio favoring males. In several states, the number of South Asians surpasses that of the native population. The four smallest states (by area), with coastlines entirely bordering the Persian Gulf, showcase the world&#x27;s most extreme population growth, nearly tripling every two decades. In 2014, the estimated population of the Arabian Peninsula was 77,983,936 (including expatriates). The Arabian Peninsula is known for having one of the most uneven adult sex ratios in the world, with females in some regions (especially the east) constituting only a quarter of people aged between 20 and 40.

====Cities====

The eleven most populous cities on the Arabian Peninsula are:

===Landscape===
The rocks exposed vary systematically across Arabia, with the oldest rocks exposed in the Arabian-Nubian Shield near the Red Sea, overlain by earlier sediments that become younger towards the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the best-preserved ophiolite on Earth, the Semail Ophiolite, lies exposed in the mountains of the UAE and northern Oman.

The peninsula consists of:

# A central plateau, the Najd, with fertile valleys and pastures used for the grazing of sheep and other livestock
# A range of deserts: the Nefud in the north, which is stony; the Rub&#x27; al Khali or Great Arabian Desert in the south, with sand estimated to extend below the surface; between them, the Dahna Mountains
# Stretches of dry or marshy coastland with coral reefs on the Red Sea side (Tihamah)
# Oases and marshy coast-land in Eastern Arabia, the most important of which are those of the Al Ain emirate (Tawam region) and Hofuf/Al-Ahsa (in modern-day Saudi Arabia), according to an author
# The southwest monsoon coastline of Dhofar and Eastern Yemen (Mahra).
Arabia has few lakes or permanent rivers. Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called wadis, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient aquifers exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, oases form (e.g. Al-Hasa and Qatif, two of the world&#x27;s largest oases) and permit agriculture, especially palm trees, which allowed the peninsula to produce more dates than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and arid, although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.

A plateau more than high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula. The plateau slopes eastwards from the massive, rifted escarpment along the coast of the Red Sea, to the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. The interior is characterized by &quot;cuestas&quot; and valleys, drained by a system of &quot;wadis&quot;. A crescent of sand and gravel deserts lies to the east.

====Mountains====
There are mountains at the eastern, southern and northwestern borders of the peninsula. Broadly, the ranges can be grouped as follows:
* Northeast: The Hajar range, of UAE and Oman
* Southeast: The Dhofar Mountains of southern Oman, contiguous with the eastern Yemeni Hadhramaut
* West: Bordering the eastern coast of the Red Sea are the Sarawat, which can be seen to include the Haraz Mountains to the east of Yemen, as well as those of &#x27;Asir (once part of Yemen) and Hejaz the latter including the Midian in what is now northwestern Saudi Arabia
* Northwest: Aside from the Sarawat, the northern portion of Saudi Arabia hosts the Jabal Shamar Mountains, which include the Aja and Salma subranges
* Central: The Najd hosts the Tuwaiq Escarpment or Tuwair range

From the Hejaz southwards, the mountains show a steady increase in altitude westward as they get nearer to Yemen, and the highest peaks and ranges are all located in Yemen. The highest, Jabal An-Nabi Shu&#x27;ayb or Jabal Hadhur of the Haraz subrange of the Sarawat range, is high. By comparison, the Tuwayr, Shammar and Dhofar generally do not exceed in height.

Not all mountains in the peninsula are visibly within ranges. Jebel Hafeet in particular, on the border of the UAE and Oman, measuring between , is not within the Hajar range, but may be considered an outlier of that range.

===Land and sea===
Most of the Arabian Peninsula is unsuited to agriculture, making irrigation and land reclamation projects essential. The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, coffee and tropical fruits. Goat, sheep, and camel husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid tropical monsoon climate, in particular the Dhofar and Al Mahrah areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical monsoon rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid desert climate or arid steppe climate. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally tropical sea with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world&#x27;s largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in symbiosis with the Red Sea coral, the protozoa and zooxanthellae, have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the indopacific coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. The Persian gulf has suffered significant loss and degradation of coral reefs with the biggest ongoing threat believed to be coastal construction activity altering the marine environment.

The fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at . In the higher elevations, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and khat cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.

According to NASA&#x27;s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data (2003–2013) analysed in a University of California, Irvine (UCI)-led study published in Water Resources Research on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the Arabian Aquifer System, upon which more than 60 million people depend for water. Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers &quot;have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted&quot; and thirteen of them are &quot;considered significantly distressed&quot;.

==History==
Stone tools from the Middle Paleolithic age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti&#x27;s al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominins migrated through a &quot;Green Arabia&quot; between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago. 200,000-year-old stone tools were discovered at Shuaib Al-Adgham in the eastern Al-Qassim Province, which would indicate that many prehistoric sites, located along a network of rivers, had once existed in the area. Acheulean tools found in Saffaqah, Riyadh Region reveal that hominins lived in the Arabian Peninsula around 188,000 years ago. Human habitation in Arabia may have occurred as early as 130,000 years ago. A fossilized &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; finger bone found at Al Wusta in the Nefud Desert dates to approximately 90,000 years ago and is the oldest human fossil discovered outside of Africa and the Levant. This indicates human migrations from Africa to Arabia occurred around this time. The Arabian Peninsula may have been the homeland of a &#x27;Basal Eurasian&#x27; population, which diverged from other Eurasians soon after the Out-of-Africa migration, and subsequently became isolated, until it started to mix with other populations in the Middle East since around 25,000 years ago. These different Middle Eastern populations would later spread Basal Eurasian ancestry via the Neolithic Revolution to all of Western Eurasia.

===Pre-Islamic Arabia===
There is evidence that human habitation in the Arabian Peninsula dates back to about 106,000 to 130,000 years ago. The harsh climate historically prevented much settlement in the pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula, apart from a small number of urban trading settlements, such as Mecca and Medina, located in the Hejaz in the west of the peninsula.

Archaeology has revealed the existence of many civilizations in pre-Islamic Arabia (such as the Thamud), especially in South Arabia. South Arabian civilizations include the Himyarite Kingdom, the Kingdom of Awsan, the Kingdom of Ma&#x27;īn, and the Sabaean Kingdom (usually considered to be the biblical land of Sheba). From 106 AD to 630 AD northwestern Arabia was under the control of the Roman Empire, which renamed it Arabia Petraea. Central Arabia was the location of the Kingdom of Kinda in the 4th, 5th and early 6th centuries. Eastern Arabia was home to the Dilmun civilization. The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the peninsula into neighbouring areas.

The Arabian Peninsula has long been accepted as the original &quot;Urheimat&quot; of the Semitic languages by most scholars.

===Rise of Islam===
The seventh century saw the rise of Islam as the peninsula&#x27;s dominant religion. The Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but migrated to Medina in 622. From there he and his companions united the tribes of Arabia under the banner of Islam and created the First Islamic State - a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian Peninsula.

Under the subsequent Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates, rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula formed a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest Indian subcontinent, across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, southern Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the Pyrenees.

With Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, who was Muhammad&#x27;s intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr&#x27;s immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by Byzantine (or Eastern Roman Empire) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the Ridda wars, or &quot;Wars of Apostasy&quot;.

On his death in 634, he was succeeded by Umar as caliph, followed by Uthman ibn al-Affan and Ali ibn Abi Talib. The period of these first four caliphs is known as &quot;al-khulafā&#x27; ar-rāshidūn&quot;: the Rashidun or &quot;rightly guided&quot; Caliphate. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their Umayyad successors, the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the Byzantine army and destroyed the Persian Empire, conquering huge swathes of territory from the Iberian peninsula to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.

Nevertheless, Mecca and Medina remained the spiritually most important places in the Muslim world. The Qur&#x27;an requires every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, as one of the five pillars of Islam, to make a pilgrimage, or Hajj, to Mecca during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah at least once in his or her lifetime. The Masjid al-Haram (the Grand Mosque) in Mecca is the location of the Kaaba, Islam&#x27;s holiest site, and the Masjid al-Nabawi (the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque) in Medina is the location of Muhammad&#x27;s grave; as a result, from the 7th century, Mecca and Medina became the pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of Muslims from across the Islamic world.

===Middle Ages===

Despite its spiritual importance, in political terms Arabia soon became a peripheral region of the Islamic world, in which the most important medieval Islamic states were based at various times in such far away cities as Damascus, Baghdad, and Cairo.
However, from the 10th century (and, in fact, until the 20th century) the Hashemite Sharifs of Mecca maintained a state in the most developed part of the region, the Hejaz. Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of Mecca and Medina but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the Hejaz. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the Hejaz, they were usually subject to the suzerainty of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the Abbasids of Baghdad, and the Fatimids, Ayyubids, and Mamluks of Egypt.

===Modern history===

The provincial Ottoman Army for Arabia (Arabistan Ordusu) was headquartered in Syria, which included Palestine, the Transjordan region in addition to Lebanon (Mount Lebanon was, however, a semi-autonomous mutasarrifate). It was put in charge of Syria, Cilicia, Iraq, and the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula. The Ottomans never had any control over central Arabia, also known as the Najd region.

The emergence of what was to become the Saudi royal family, known as the Al Saud, began in Najd in central Arabia in 1744, when Muhammad bin Saud, founder of the dynasty, joined forces with the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, founder of the Wahhabi movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam. The Emirate of Diriyah established in the area around Riyadh rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia, sacking Karbala in 1802, and capturing Mecca in 1803.

The Damascus Protocol of 1914 provides an illustration of the regional relationships. Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of Hejaz, asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula. It would have comprised Cilicia – İskenderun and Mersin, Iraq with Kuwait, Syria, Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Jordan, and Palestine.

In the modern era, the term bilad al-Yaman came to refer specifically to the southwestern parts of the peninsula. Arab geographers started to refer to the whole peninsula as &#x27;jazirat al-Arab&#x27;, or the peninsula of the Arabs.

====Late Ottoman rule and the Hejaz Railway====
The railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II and was built largely by the Turks, with German advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a waqf, an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.

====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====
The major developments of the early 20th century were the Arab Revolt during World War I and the subsequent collapse and partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The Arab Revolt (1916–1918) was initiated by the Sherif Hussein ibn Ali with the aim of securing independence from the ruling Ottoman Empire and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.

These events were followed by the foundation of Saudi Arabia under King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured Riyadh. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, Jabal Shammar, Hejaz between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis absorbed the Emirate of Asir, with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a war with Yemen. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.

====Oil reserves====
The second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of Yemen.

====North Yemen Civil War====

The North Yemen Civil War was fought in North Yemen between royalists of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen and factions of the Yemen Arab Republic from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a coup d&#x27;état carried out by the republican leader, Abdullah as-Sallal, which dethroned the newly crowned Muhammad al-Badr and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the Saudi Arabian border and rallied popular support.

The royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by Egypt and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt&#x27;s commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army&#x27;s involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.

By 1970, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to Egypt&#x27;s role in the war in Yemen as analogous to the United States&#x27; role in the Vietnam War.

====Gulf War====

In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces led to the 1990–91 Gulf War. Egypt, Qatar, Syria, and Saudi Arabia joined a multinational coalition that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by Jordan and Palestine resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called &quot;Damascus Declaration&quot; formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC member states.

====2014 Yemen civil war====

The Arab Spring reached Yemen in January 2011. People of Yemen took to the street demonstrating against three decades of rule by President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The demonstration led to cracks in the ruling General People&#x27;s Congress (GPC) and Saleh&#x27;s Sanhani clan. Saleh used tactics of concession and violence to save his presidency. After numerous attempts, Saleh accepted the Gulf Cooperation Council&#x27;s mediation. He eventually handed power to Vice President Hadi, who was sworn in as President of Yemen on 25 February 2012. Hadi launched a national dialogue to address new constitutional, political and social issues. The Houthi movement, dissatisfied with the outcomes of the national dialogue, launched an offensive and stormed the Yemeni capital Sanaa on 21 September 2014. In response, Saudi Arabia launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015. The civil war and subsequent military intervention and blockade caused a famine in Yemen.

<text>In telecommunications, information transfer is the process of moving messages containing user information from a source to a sink via a communication channel. In this sense, information transfer is equivalent to data transmission which highlights more practical, technical aspects.

The information transfer rate may or may not be equal to the transmission modulation rate.

Bidirectional information transfer is called information exchange.

==Non-technical meaning==
In a non-technical context, information transfer is sometimes used to signify knowledge transfer or teaching. A successful transfer of information depends on many aspects, not least the choice of the specific medium (media-adequacy).

<doc id="47868" wikidata="Q1172540" url="?curid=47868" title="Data stream">
<text>In connection-oriented communication, a data stream is the transmission of a sequence of digitally encoded signals to convey information. Typically, the transmitted symbols are grouped into a series of packets.

Data streaming has become ubiquitous. Anything transmitted over the Internet is transmitted as a data stream. Using a mobile phone to have a conversation transmits the sound as a data stream.

==Formal definition==
In a formal way, a data stream is any ordered pair formula_1 where:

# formula_2 is a sequence of tuples and
# formula_3 is a sequence of positive real time intervals.

==Content==
Data Stream contains different sets of data, that depend on the chosen data format. 
* Attributes – each attribute of the data stream represents a certain type of data, e.g. segment / data point ID, timestamp, geodata. 
* Timestamp attribute helps to identify when an event occurred.
* Subject ID is an encoded-by-algorithm ID, that has been extracted out of a cookie. 
* Raw Data includes information straight from the data provider without being processed by an algorithm nor human.
* Processed Data is a data that has been prepared (somehow modified, validated or cleaned), to be used for future actions.

==Usage==
There are various areas where data streams are used:
* Fraud detection &amp; scoring – raw data is used as source data for an anti-fraud algorithm (data analysis techniques for fraud detection). For example, timestamps, cookie occurrences or analysis of data points are used within the scoring system to detect fraud or to make sure that a message receiver is not a bot (so-called Non-Human Traffic).
* Artificial intelligence – raw data is treated like a train set and a test set during AI and machine learning algorithms building.
* Raw data is used for profiling and personalization to customize user profiles and divide them for segmentation, e.g., per gender or location (based on data point).
* Business intelligence – raw data is a source of information for BI systems, used for enriching user profiles with detailed information about them, e.g., purchase path or geodata. This information is used for business analysis and predictive research. 
* Targeting – processed data by data scientists improve online campaigns and is used for reaching the target audience. 
* CRM Enrichment – raw data is integrated with customer-relationship management system. CRM integration allows to fill the gaps in users&#x27; profiles with demographic data, interests or buying intentions.

==Integration==
Core integrations with data streams are:
* Data streams are integrated with systems such as customer data platform (CDP), customer relationship management (CRM) or data management platform (DMP) to enrich users&#x27; profiles with external data. It is possible to expand the knowledge about existing users by using external sources.
* Data streams are used to enrich business intelligence systems and make analysis more precise and conclusions more accurate. 
* In the case of content management system (CMS) integration, Data Stream is used to identify the users and personalize their visit, even if it&#x27;s their first one. By data analysis, the actual content of the website is adapted to the user. 
* Data streams are integrated with demand side platform (DSP) within programmatic advertising ecosystem. Parties (e.g., advertisers) can exchange the users&#x27; IDs and concatenate with them existing profiles. 
* Data streams are used to choose respective user segments (e.g., people interested in the automotive industry) and use them in an online campaign. Segments are enriched with more user characteristics out of data stream and then sent to DSP.

==Data sources visible==
In a data stream it is visible what device has been used by the user side – it is visible on user agent:
* mobile – when a user uses a mobile browser to explore, it has narrow screen resolution and mobile app version, respectively; 
* desktop – when a user uses a desktop browser or app version. 
The following information is shared out of used device:
* Actual URL to the visited website, where an event occurred
* User Agent
* Geolocation 
* Internet Protocol (IP)

==Formats==
A data point is a tag that collects information about a certain action, performed by a user on a website. Data points exists in two types, the values of which are used to create appropriate audiences. Those are:
* &#x27;event&#x27; with information about occurrences of the specific event (e.g., click on a link or displaying ad)
* &#x27;attribute&#x27; with numerical or alphanumerical values.
Segment is a logical statement, built on specific Data Points using AND, OR or NOT operators.
Hybrid data – raw data out of both Data Point and Segment data formats.
URLs – is a set of information about a particular URL that has been visited. 

==GDPR==
Information gathered out of websites are based on user behavior. Data providers deliver both personal or non-personal information. There are two types of user data available in data stream:
* Personally identifiable information (PII) – information that allows clearly or by combining with data identification methods identify a person. Examples of PII are: insurance ID, email address, phone number, IP address, geolocation, biometric data.
* Non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) is information that can&#x27;t be used to identify a person or to track a location. A cookie or a device ID is an example of non-PII.

Once a work or farming tool with few creature comforts, in the 1950s, US consumers began purchasing pickups for lifestyle reasons, and by the 1990s, less than 15 percent of owners reported use in work as the pickup truck&#x27;s primary purpose. In North America, the pickup is mostly used as a passenger car and accounts for about 18% of total vehicles sold in the United States. Full-sized pickups and SUVs are an important source of revenue for major car manufacturers such as Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, accounting for more than two-thirds of their global pre-tax earnings, though they make up just 16% of North American vehicle production. These vehicles have a high profit margin and a high price tag; in 2018, Kelley Blue Book cited an average cost (including optional features) of US$47,174 for a new Ford F-150. 

The term pickup is of unknown origin. It was used by Studebaker in 1913. By the 1930s, it had become the standard term in certain markets for a light-duty truck.

==History==

In the early days of automobile manufacturing, vehicles were sold only as a chassis and third parties added bodies on top. In 1902, the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company was founded by Max Grabowsky and Morris Grabowsky who built one-ton carrying capacity trucks in Pontiac, Michigan. In 1913, the Galion Allsteel Body Company, an early developer of the pickup and dump truck, built and installed hauling boxes on slightly modified Ford Model T chassis, and from 1917, on the Model TT. Seeking part of this market share, Dodge introduced a 3/4-ton pickup with a cab and body constructed entirely of wood in 1924. In 1925, Ford followed up with a steel-bodied half-ton based on the Model T with an adjustable tailgate and heavy-duty rear springs. Billed as the &quot;Ford Model T Runabout with Pickup Body,&quot; it sold for ; 34,000 were built. In 1928, it was replaced by the Model A, which had a closed-cab, safety-glass windshield, roll-up side windows, and three-speed transmission.

In 1931, General Motors introduced light-duty pickups for both GMC and Chevrolet targeted at private ownership. These pickup trucks were based on the Chevrolet Master. In 1940, GM introduced the dedicated light-truck platform, separate from passenger cars, which GM named the AK series. Ford North America continued to offer a pickup body style on the Ford Model 51, and the Ford Australian division produced the first Australian &quot;ute&quot; in 1932. In 1940, Ford offered a dedicated light-duty truck platform called the Ford F-100, then upgraded the platform after World War II to the Ford F-Series in 1948.

Dodge at first assumed heavier truck production from Graham-Paige, while the company produced their light (pickup) trucks, initially on their sufficiently sturdy passenger car frames. But after switching to distinct, dedicated truck frames in 1936, Dodge/Fargo launched an extensive own truck range for 1939, marketed as the &quot;Job-Rated&quot; trucks. These Art Deco–styled trucks were again continued after World War II.

International Harvester offered the International K and KB series, which were marketed towards construction and farming and did not have a strong retail consumer presence, and Studebaker also manufactured the M-series truck. At the beginning of World War II, the United States government halted the production of privately owned pickup trucks, and all American manufacturers built heavy duty trucks for the war effort.

In the 1950s, consumers began purchasing pickups for lifestyle rather than utilitarian reasons. Car-like, smooth-sided, fenderless trucks were introduced, such as the Chevrolet Fleetside, the Chevrolet El Camino, the Dodge Sweptline, and in 1957, Ford&#x27;s purpose-built Styleside. Pickups began to feature comfort items such as power options and air conditioning. During this time, pickups with four doors, known as crew cabs, started to become popular. These pickup trucks were released in 1954 in Japan with the Toyota Stout, in 1957 in Japan with the Datsun 220, and in 1957 in America with the International Travelette. Other manufacturers soon followed, including the Hino Briska in 1962, Dodge in 1963, Ford in 1965, and General Motors in 1973.

In 1961 in the UK the British Motor Corporation launched an Austin Mini Pickup version of the original 1959 Mini. It was in production until 1983.
In 1963, the US chicken tax directly curtailed the import of the Volkswagen Type 2, distorting the market in favor of US manufacturers. The tariff directly affected any country seeking to bring light trucks into the United States and effectively &quot;squeezed smaller Asian truck companies out of the American pickup market.&quot; Over the intervening years, Detroit lobbied to protect the light-truck tariff, thereby reducing pressure on Detroit to introduce vehicles that polluted less and that offered increased fuel economy.

The US government&#x27;s 1973 Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) policy set higher fuel-economy requirements for cars than pickups. CAFE led to the replacement of the station wagon by the minivan, the latter of which belonged in the truck category, which allowed it to comply with less strict emissions standards. Eventually, CAFE led to the promotion of sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Pickups, unhindered by the emissions controls regulations on cars, began to replace muscle cars as the performance vehicle of choice. The Dodge Warlock appeared in Dodge&#x27;s &quot;adult toys&quot; line, along with the Macho Power Wagon and Street Van. The 1978 gas guzzler tax, which taxed fuel-inefficient cars while exempting pickup trucks, further distorted the market in favor of pickups. Furthermore, until 1999, light trucks were not required to meet the same safety standards as cars, and 20 years later, most still lagged behind cars in the adoption of safety features.

In the 1980s, the compact Mazda B-series, Isuzu Faster, and Mitsubishi Forte debuted. Subsequently, US manufacturers built their compact pickups for the domestic market, including the Ford Ranger, and the Chevrolet S-10. Minivans make inroads into the pickups&#x27; market share. In the 1990s, pickups&#x27; market share was further eroded by the popularity of SUVs.

Mid-sized electric trucks had been tried early in the 20th century but soon lost out to gasoline and diesel vehicles. In 1997, the Chevrolet S-10 EV was released, but few were sold, and those were mostly to fleet operators.

By 2023, pickup trucks had become strictly more lifestyle than utilitarian vehicles. Annual surveys of Ford F-150 owners from 2012 to 2021 revealed that 87% of the owners used their trucks frequently for shopping and running errands and 70% for pleasure driving, whereas 28% used their trucks often for personal hauling (41% occasionally and 32% rarely/never) and only 7% used them for towing while 29% only did so occasionally and 63% rarely/never did. The 1960s–1970s Ford F-100 was typically a regular cab and consisted of mostly 64% bed and 36% cab, while by mid-2000s, crew cabs were largely becoming the norm and the bed was shrunk to accommodate the larger cab, and a 2023 F-150 consisted of 63% cab and 37% bed.

==International markets==
While the Ford F-150 has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States since 1982, the Ford F-150, or indeed any full-sized pickup truck, is a rare sight in Europe, where higher fuel prices and narrower city roads make it difficult to use daily. In the United States, pickups are favored by a cultural attachment to the style, lower fuel prices, and taxes and regulations that distort the market in favor of domestically built trucks. As of 2016, the IRS offers tax breaks for business use of &quot;any vehicle equipped with a cargo area ... of at least six feet in interior length that is not readily accessible from the passenger compartment&quot;.

In Europe, pickups represent less than 1% of light vehicles sold, the most popular being the Ford Ranger with 27,300 units sold in 2015. Other models include the Renault Alaskan (a rebadged Nissan Navara), and the Toyota Hilux.

The NOx law and other differing regulations prevent pickups from being imported to Japan, but the Japanese domestic market Mitsubishi Triton was available for a limited time. The most recent pickup truck for sale in Japan is the Toyota Hilux.

In China (where it is known by the English loanword as 皮卡车 pí kǎ chē), the Great Wall Wingle is manufactured domestically and exported to Australia. In Thailand, pickups manufactured for local sale and export include the Isuzu D-Max and the Mitsubishi Triton. In Latin and South America, the Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger, VW Amarok, Dodge Ram, Chevrolet S-10, Chevrolet D-20, and Chevrolet Montana are sold.

In South Africa, pickups account for about 17% of the passenger and light commercial vehicle sales, mostly the Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger, and Isuzu KB (Isuzu D-Max). The Volkswagen Amarok and Nissan Navara are also sold.

==Design and features==
In the United States and Canada, nearly all new pickups are sold with automatic transmissions. Only the Jeep Gladiator and the Toyota Tacoma are available with manual transmissions.

A regular cab, single cab or standard cab, has a single row of seats and a single set of doors, one on each side.

Extended cab or extra cab pickups add an extra space behind the main seat, sometimes including smaller jump seats which can fold out of the way to create more storage space. The first extended-cab truck in the United States was called the &quot;Club Cab&quot; and was introduced by Chrysler in 1973 on its Dodge D-series pickup trucks. Extended-cab trucks either have just a single set of doors with no direct access to the extended portion of the cab, very small (half-sized) rear doors that are rear-hinged which can only be opened after the front doors are open, or small (three-quarter-sized) front-hinged doors.

A crew cab, or double cab, seats five or six and has four full-sized, front-hinged doors. The first crew-cab truck in the United States was made by International Harvester in 1957 and was later followed by Dodge in 1963, Ford in 1965, and Chevrolet in 1973. However, they were originally available only with three-quarter-ton or one-ton models (such as Ford F-250/F-350), while half-ton trucks like Ford F-150 would not become available in four-door configuration until 2001, by which time crew cabs also started overtaking regular/extended cabs in popularity.

Cab-over or cab forward designs have the cab sitting above the front axle. This arrangement allows a longer cargo area for the same overall length. An early cab-forward, drop-sided pickup was the Volkswagen Transporter, introduced in 1952. This configuration is more common among European and Japanese manufacturers than in North America. The design was more popular in North America in the 1950s and 1960s, with examples including the Chevrolet Corvair Rampside and Loadside, Dodge A-100 and A-108, Ford Econoline, and Jeep FC-150 and FC-170.

A &quot;dually&quot; is a North American colloquial term for a pickup with four rear wheels instead of two, able to carry more weight over the rear axle. Vehicles similar to the pickup include the coupé utility, a car-based pickup, and the larger sport utility truck (SUT), based on a sport utility vehicle (SUV).

The terms half-ton, three-quarter-ton, and one-ton are remnants from a time when the number referred to the maximum cargo capacity by weight.

In North America, some pickup trucks may be marketed as heavy duty (eg Ram Heavy Duty), super duty (eg Ford Super Duty) or simply &quot;HD&quot;. This is typically a pickup truck with higher payload and/or towing capabilities than is standard for their size. While synonymous with &quot;dually&quot; or full-size pickup trucks in North American, none of those are requirements. Dually is not available on Ram 2500 or Ford F-250 and is optional on Ram 3500 or Ford F-350, but those pickup trucks are all heavy duty. Mahindra Bolero MaXX Pik-Up HD is a heavy duty mid-size pickup truck with a two tonne payload.

Some pickup trucks have an opening at the rear of the cab to increase cargo capacity lengthwise without increasing overall vehicle length or wheelbase, which reduces break over, approach, departure angles and increases turning radius. This feature is referred to as a mid-gate due to it being located in the middle of a pickup truck, as opposed to the tail-gate, which is located as the rear/tail of the vehicle.

=== Bed styles===
The cargo bed can vary in size according to whether the vehicle is optimized for cargo utility or passenger comfort. Most have fixed side walls and a hinged tailgate. Cargo beds are normally found in two styles: stepside or fleetside. A stepside bed has fenders that extend on the outside of the cargo area; originally these were just fenders attached to a cargo box. This style used to be the standard design, as it was cheaper to manufacture. A fleetside bed has wheel wells inside of a double-walled bed, and most are usually designed to match the cab&#x27;s styling. The two types of bed have been given a variety of names by different manufacturers; &quot;Stepside&quot; and &quot;Fleetside&quot; originate with Chevrolet but are also frequently used by Dodge as well as GMC. GMC has also used &quot;Wideside&quot; instead of Fleetside, while Dodge has also used &quot;Utiline&quot; and &quot;Sweptline&quot; for the two types. Ford uses &quot;Flareside&quot; and &quot;Styleside&quot;, respectively. Jeep has used &quot;Sportside&quot; and &quot;Thriftside&quot; for the separate fender style, and &quot;Townside&quot; for flush designs. International Harvester called the two types &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Bonus-Load&quot;.

The first fleet-sided pickup truck was the Crosley in the 1940s, followed by the 1955 Chevrolet Cameo Carrier. Early pickups had wood-plank beds, which were largely replaced by steel by the 1960s. In many parts of the world, pickups frequently use a dropside bed – with a flat tray with hinged panels that can be raised separately on the sides and the rear. The fleetside has gradually fully replaced the earlier, separate-fender look: The last time Chevrolet and GMC used the Stepside style was on the 2005 Silverado and Sierra 1500 models; Ford last used the Flareside style on the 2009 F-150.

==Safety==

Consumer pickup trucks sold in the US have increased in weight by 32% since 1990. Also, cabins have grown and risen further from the ground and grill and hood sizes have increased over time. These changes mean that a modern standard pickup truck has a longer blind spot in front of its grill than most other vehicles as well as increased blind spots behind and to the side. The Ford F-250 has a hood almost from the ground. It may be impossible to see a small object such as a child as far as in front of the vehicle. A total of 575 children in the US died in front-over deaths between 2009 and 2019, most by their parents. This is an 89% increase in mortality from the previous ten years. Additionally, US car-related fatalities went up by 8% and pedestrian casualties increased by 46% between 2011 and 2021. While the reasons for this increase are complex, Consumer Reports partially attributes this number to increased truck size and prevalence. Chuck Farmer from the US Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has found large pickup trucks to be as deadly or deadlier than muscle cars and &quot;... are work trucks, and people should not be using them primarily for commuting, because they kill so many other drivers.&quot;

==Uses==
In the United States and Canada, pickups are used primarily for passenger transport. Pickup trucks are often marketed and used for their hauling (utilizing cargo bed) and towing (utilizing body-on-frame design and long wheelbase) capabilities.

Pickup trucks are also used by many journeymen, tradesmen, and outdoor enthusiasts. They are also used to move or transport large goods. For example, in the US, a homeowner can rent a pickup truck to transport a large appliance from a home supply store.

Equipping pickup trucks with a camper shell provides a small space for camping. Slide-in truck campers can offer a pickup truck the amenities of a small motorhome, but still allow the operator the option of removal and independent use of the vehicle.

Pickups are popular with overlanders as they are often the most affordable vehicle capable of carrying the large quantities of fuel needed for long distance, remote travel and generator use without expensive modifications.

Modified pickups can be used as improvised, unarmored combat vehicles called a technical.

Pickup trucks are used to carry passengers in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. In Thailand, most songthaews are converted pickup trucks and flatbed trucks. In Haiti, tap taps are also converted pickup trucks.

Towing with pickup trucks is separated into two categories: conventional towing (bumper pull) and in-bed (heavy duty) towing. Conventional towing mounts the hitch at the rear of the pickup truck, in-bed towing mounts the hitch directly above or in front of the rear axle. Weight distribution hitch falls under conventional towing. Fifth wheel and gooseneck fall under in-bed towing.

==Sizes==
===Kei/Mini truck===
Kei trucks are a Japanese class with a maximum length of , a maximum width of , a maximum height of , and a maximum displacement of .

In some countries, mini trucks are similar to, or slightly bigger than, kei trucks. In other countries, eg the United States, mini trucks are another name for any pickup smaller than full-size pickups.

UTVs are of similar size and serve similar roles in developed countries but are typically restricted to off-road and rural areas.

===Compact pickup truck===
Typically, a unibody pickup truck is built on compact SUV platform or a compact passenger car platform. Examples include the Hyundai Santa Cruz and Ford Maverick. Subaru also produced the Subaru Baja based heavily on the Subaru Outback (Legacy) wagon and Subaru BRAT based on the Subaru Leone wagon using a unibody construction. Other variations include the Holden Crewman and Holden one tonner which are based on a sedan platform but use a part-monocoque, part chassis frame construction.

===Mid-size pickup truck===
Typically, a body-on-frame pickup truck of a similar size to a mid-size SUV. Examples include the Ford Ranger, Toyota Hilux, and Isuzu D-Max. This is usually the largest size pickup sold or manufactured in countries outside North America.

===Full-size pickup truck===

A body-on-frame pickup truck with an exterior width of more than two meters (excluding mirrors and/or widebody/flares for dually wheels).

<text>Huntington&#x27;s disease (HD), also known as Huntington&#x27;s chorea, is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that is mostly inherited. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental/psychiatric abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. It is also a basal ganglia disease causing a hyperkinetic movement disorder known as &quot;chorea&quot;. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, involuntary body movements of chorea become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia, depression, apathy, and impulsivity at times. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, and can start at any age but are usually seen around the age of 40. The disease may develop earlier in each successive generation. About eight percent of cases start before the age of 20 years, and are known as &quot;juvenile HD&quot;, which typically present with the slow movement symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease rather than those of chorea.
HD is typically inherited from an affected parent, who carries a mutation in the huntingtin gene (&quot;HTT&quot;). However, up to 10% of cases are due to a new mutation. The huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for huntingtin protein (Htt). Expansion of CAG repeats of cytosine-adenine-guanine (known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion) in the gene coding for the huntingtin protein results in an abnormal mutant protein (mHtt), which gradually damages brain cells through a number of possible mechanisms. The mutant protein is dominant, so having one parent who is a carrier of the trait is sufficient to trigger the disease in their children. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, which can be carried out at any time, regardless of whether or not symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.
No cure for HD is known, and full-time care is required in the later stages. Treatments can relieve some symptoms and in some, improve quality of life. The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with tetrabenazine. HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent. It is rare among the Finnish and Japanese, while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown. The disease affects males and females equally. Complications such as pneumonia, heart disease, and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy; although fatal aspiration pneumonia is commonly cited as the ultimate cause of death for those with the condition. Suicide is the cause of death in about 9% of cases. Death typically occurs 15–20 years from when the disease was first detected.
The earliest known description of the disease was in 1841 by American physician Charles Oscar Waters. The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by American physician George Huntington. The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation. Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness, provide support for individuals and their families and promote research. Research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving animal models to aid with research, testing of medications and their delivery to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and studying procedures such as stem-cell therapy with the goal of replacing damaged or lost neurons.

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms of Huntington&#x27;s disease most commonly become noticeable between the ages of 30 and 50 years, but they can begin at any age and present as a triad of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. When developed in an early stage, it is known as juvenile Huntington&#x27;s disease. In 50% of cases, the psychiatric symptoms appear first. Their progression is often described in early stages, middle stages, and late stages with an earlier prodromal phase. In the early stages, subtle personality changes, problems in cognition and physical skills, irritability, and mood swings occur, all of which may go unnoticed, and these usually precede the motor symptoms. Almost everyone with HD eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression, and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.

The most characteristic initial physical symptoms are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea. Many people are not aware of their involuntary movements, or impeded by them. Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction by at least three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions, or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain that is responsible for movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. When muscle control is affected such as rigidity or muscle contracture this is known as dystonia. Dystonia is a neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder that results in twisting or repetitive movements, that may resemble a tremor. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Sleep disturbances and weight loss are also associated symptoms. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. Weight loss is common in people with Huntington&#x27;s disease, and it progresses with the disease. Juvenile HD generally progresses at a faster rate with greater cognitive decline, and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all; the Westphal variant of slowness of movement, rigidity, and tremors is more typical in juvenile HD, as are seizures.

Cognitive abilities are progressively impaired and tend to generally decline into dementia. Especially affected are executive functions, which include planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, initiation of appropriate actions, and inhibition of inappropriate actions. Different cognitive impairments include difficulty focusing on tasks, lack of flexibility, a lack of impulse, a lack of awareness of one&#x27;s own behaviors and abilities and difficulty learning or processing new information. As the disease progresses, memory deficits tend to appear. Reported impairments range from short-term memory deficits to long-term memory difficulties, including deficits in episodic (memory of one&#x27;s life), procedural (memory of the body of how to perform an activity), and working memory.

Reported neuropsychiatric signs are anxiety, depression, a reduced display of emotions, egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behavior and hallucination and delusion. Other common psychiatric disorders could include obsessive–compulsive disorder, mania, insomnia and bipolar disorder. Difficulties in recognizing other people&#x27;s negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33 and 76%. For many with the disease and their families, these symptoms are among the most distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Early behavioral changes in HD result in an increased risk of suicide. Often, individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, cognitive, and emotional impairments.

Mutant huntingtin is expressed throughout the body and associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissues that are directly caused by such expression outside the brain. These abnormalities include muscle atrophy, cardiac failure, impaired glucose tolerance, weight loss, osteoporosis, and testicular atrophy.

==Genetics==

Everyone has two copies of the huntingtin gene (&quot;HTT&quot;), which codes for the huntingtin protein (Htt). &quot;HTT&quot; is also called the HD gene, and the &quot;IT15&quot; gene, (interesting transcript 15). Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat expansion – a short repeat, which varies in length between individuals, and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes, which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington&#x27;s disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant; mutation of either of a person&#x27;s &quot;HTT&quot; alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but by the length of the repeated section of the gene; hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.

===Genetic mutation===

HD is one of several trinucleotide repeat disorders that are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range. The &quot;HTT&quot; gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 at 4p16.3. &quot;HTT&quot; contains a sequence of three DNA bases—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e. ... CAGCAGCAG ...), known as a trinucleotide repeat. CAG is the three-letter genetic code (codon) for the amino acid glutamine, so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the &quot;polyQ region&quot;.


Generally, people have fewer than 36 repeated glutamines in the polyQ region, which results in the production of the cytoplasmic protein huntingtin. However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results in the production of a protein with different characteristics. This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mHtt), increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons and are affected accordingly. Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to the environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD. About 36 to 39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases, the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed. With very large repeat counts (more than 60), HD onset can occur below the age of 20, known as juvenile HD. Juvenile HD is typically of the Westphal variant that is characterized by slowness of movement, rigidity, and tremors. This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.

===Inheritance===

Huntington&#x27;s disease has autosomal dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one copy of the gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since the penetrance of the mutation is very high, those who have a mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele, so are affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent. Sex-dependent or sex-linked genes are traits that are found on the X or Y chromosomes.

Trinucleotide CAG repeats numbering over 28 are unstable during replication, and this instability increases with the number of repeats present. This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass (dynamic mutations) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat. This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected parent with an &quot;intermediate&quot; number of repeats (28–35), or &quot;reduced penetrance&quot; (36–40), may pass on a copy of the gene with an increase in the number of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD. The earlier age of onset and greater severity of disease in successive generations due to increases in the number of repeats is known as genetic anticipation. Instability is greater in spermatogenesis than oogenesis; maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length, whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length. Rarely is Huntington&#x27;s disease caused by a new mutation, where neither parent has over 36 CAG repeats.

In the rare situations where both parents have an expanded HD gene, the risk increases to 75%, and when either parent has two expanded copies, the risk is 100% (all children will be affected). Individuals with both genes affected are rare. For some time, HD was thought to be the only disease for which possession of a second mutated gene did not affect symptoms and progression, but it has since been found that it can affect the phenotype and the rate of progression.

==Mechanisms==
Huntingtin protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, and appears to have multiple functions. The behavior of the mutated protein (mHtt) is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly brain cells. Early damage is most evident in the subcortical basal ganglia, initially in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, other areas of the brain are also affected, including regions of the cerebral cortex. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood, and higher cognitive function. DNA methylation also appears to be changed in HD.

In 2025, scientists affiliated with Harvard and MIT are believed to have revealed why symptoms of the disease starts earlier in some people who inherit it and later in others: the repeats of a gene sequence become toxic at 150 repeats.

===Huntingtin function===

Htt is expressed in all cells, with the highest concentrations found in the brain and testes, and moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. Its functions are unclear, but it does interact with proteins involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of Htt have been identified. In these animals, Htt is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an antiapoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein that protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. Htt also facilitates synaptic vesicular transport and synaptic transmission, and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of Htt is increased, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHtt are reduced, whereas when the expression of Htt is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more as seen in the presence of mHtt. Accordingly, the disease is thought not to be caused by inadequate production of Htt, but by a toxic gain-of-function of mHtt in the body.

===Cellular changes===

The toxic action of mHtt may manifest and produce the HD pathology through multiple cellular changes. In its mutant (polyglutamine expanded) form, the protein is more prone to cleavage that creates shorter fragments containing the polyglutamine expansion. These protein fragments have a propensity to undergo misfolding and aggregation, yielding fibrillar aggregates in which non-native polyglutamine β-strands from multiple proteins are bonded together by hydrogen bonds. These aggregates share the same fundamental cross-beta amyloid architecture seen in other protein deposition diseases . Over time, the aggregates accumulate to form inclusion bodies within cells, ultimately interfering with neuronal function. Inclusion bodies have been found in both the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. Inclusion bodies in cells of the brain are one of the earliest pathological changes, and some experiments have found that they can be toxic for the cell, but other experiments have shown that they may form as part of the body&#x27;s defense mechanism and help protect cells.

Several pathways by which mHtt may cause cell death have been identified. These include effects on chaperone proteins, which help fold proteins and remove misfolded ones; interactions with caspases, which play a role in the process of removing cells; the toxic effects of glutamine on nerve cells; impairment of energy production within cells; and effects on the expression of genes.

Mutant huntingtin protein has been found to play a key role in mitochondrial dysfunction. The impairment of mitochondrial electron transport can result in higher levels of oxidative stress and release of reactive oxygen species.

Glutamine is known to be excitotoxic when present in large amounts, that can cause damage to numerous cellular structures. Excessive glutamine is not found in HD, but the interactions of the altered huntingtin protein with numerous proteins in neurons lead to an increased vulnerability to glutamine. The increased vulnerability is thought to result in excitotoxic effects from normal glutamine levels.

A somatic expansion of CAG repeats is involved in the progression of the disease. Over decades, the HTT gene first sees its CAG repeats expand to about 80 copies: the 35+ CAG locus causes additional slippage errors that expand the repeat. Then the process accelerates, reaching 150 copies within years. There is no significant toxic effect on the cell until 150 copies, at which point a large number of genes become progressively dysregulated. Over months, the medium spiny neuron slowly loses its cell identity until cell death pathways are activated.

===Macroscopic changes===

Initially, damage to the brain is regionally specific with the dorsal striatum in the subcortical basal ganglia being primarily affected, followed later by cortical involvement in all areas. Other areas of the basal ganglia affected include the substantia nigra; cortical involvement includes cortical layers 3, 5, and 6; also evident is involvement of the hippocampus, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal medium spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal globus pallidus being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain&#x27;s immune cells, microglia.

The basal ganglia play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but theories propose that they are part of the cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to the motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated or in a motion to be halted before or beyond its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD known as chorea, a dyskinesia. Because of the basal ganglia&#x27;s inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).

===Transcriptional dysregulation===

CREB-binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional coregulator, is essential for cell function because as a coactivator at a significant number of promoters, it activates the transcription of genes for survival pathways. CBP contains an acetyltransferase domain to which HTT binds through its polyglutamine-containing domain. Autopsied brains of those who had Huntington&#x27;s disease also have been found to have incredibly reduced amounts of CBP.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlAnalysis of Strand Slippage in DNA Polymerase Expansions of CAG/CTG Triplet Repeats Associated with Neurodegenerative Disease – JBC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, when CBP is overexpressed, polyglutamine-induced death is diminished, further demonstrating that CBP plays an important role in Huntington&#x27;s disease and neurons in general.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing can be used to confirm a physical diagnosis if no family history of HD exists. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat (CAG) in the &quot;HTT&quot; gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual&#x27;s psychology, career, family-planning decisions, relatives, and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.

===Clinical===

A physical examination, sometimes combined with a psychological examination, can determine whether the onset of the disease has begun. Excessive unintentional movements of any part of the body are often the reason for seeking medical consultation. If these are abrupt and have random timing and distribution, they suggest a diagnosis of HD. Cognitive or behavioral symptoms are rarely the first symptoms diagnosed; they are usually only recognized in hindsight or when they develop further. How far the disease has progressed can be measured using the unified Huntington&#x27;s disease rating scale, which provides an overall rating system based on motor, behavioral, cognitive, and functional assessments. Medical imaging, such as a CT scan or MRI scan, can show atrophy of the caudate nuclei early in the disease, as seen in the illustration to the right, but these changes are not, by themselves, diagnostic of HD. Cerebral atrophy can be seen in the advanced stages of the disease. Functional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), can show changes in brain activity before the onset of physical symptoms, but they are experimental tools and are not used clinically.

===Predictive genetic testing===

Because HD follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, a strong motivation exists for individuals who are at risk of inheriting it to seek a diagnosis. The genetic test for HD consists of a blood test, which counts the numbers of CAG repeats in each of the &quot;HTT&quot; alleles. Cutoffs are given as follows:
* At 40 or more CAG repeats, full penetrance allele (FPA) exists. A &quot;positive test&quot; or &quot;positive result&quot; generally refers to this case. A positive result is not considered a diagnosis, since it may be obtained decades before the symptoms begin. However, a negative test means that the individual does not carry the expanded copy of the gene and will not develop HD. The test will tell a person who originally had a 50% chance of inheriting the disease if their risk goes up to 100% or is eliminated. Persons who test positive for the disease will develop HD sometime within their lifetimes, provided they live long enough for the disease to appear.
* At 36 to 39 repeats, incomplete or reduced penetrance allele (RPA) may cause symptoms, usually later in the adult life. The maximum risk is 60% that a person with an RPA will be symptomatic at age 65, and 70% at 75.
* At 27 to 35 repeats, intermediate allele (IA), or large normal allele, is not associated with symptomatic disease in the tested individual, but may expand upon further inheritance to give symptoms in offspring.
* With 26 or fewer repeats, the result is not associated with HD.

Testing before the onset of symptoms is a life-changing event and a very personal decision. The main reason given for choosing to test for HD is to aid in career and family decisions. Predictive testing for Huntington&#x27;s disease has been available via linkage analysis (which requires testing multiple family members) since 1986 and via direct mutation analysis since 1993. At that time, surveys indicated that 50–70% of at-risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing, but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested. Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because it has no treatment. A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD, compared to the impact of a positive result. Irrespective of the result, stress levels are lower two years after being tested, but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result. Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience survivor guilt about family members who are affected. Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result, which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual&#x27;s siblings will be at risk of inheriting it. In one study, genetic discrimination was found in 46% of individuals at risk for Huntington&#x27;s disease. It occurred at higher rates within personal relationships than health insurance or employment relations. Genetic counseling in HD can provide information, advice and support for initial decision-making, and then, if chosen, throughout all stages of the testing process. Because of the implications of this test, patients who wish to undergo testing must complete three counseling sessions which provide information about Huntington&#x27;s.

Counseling and guidelines on the use of genetic testing for HD have become models for other genetic disorders, such as autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. Presymptomatic testing for HD has also influenced testing for other illnesses with genetic variants such as polycystic kidney disease, familial Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and breast cancer. The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network have published yearly external quality assessment scheme for molecular genetic testing for this disease and have developed best practice guidelines for genetic testing for HD to assist in testing and reporting of results.

===Preimplantation genetic diagnosis===

Embryos produced using &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis. This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, so any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring &quot;without&quot; revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryo&#x27;s DNA is compared with that of the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In nondisclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.

===Prenatal testing===

Obtaining a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb is also possible, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when parents have been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing the expansion of the &quot;HTT&quot; gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.

In addition, in at-risk pregnancies due to an affected male partner, noninvasive prenatal diagnosis can be performed by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA in a blood sample taken from the mother (via venipuncture) between six and 12 weeks of pregnancy. It has no procedure-related risk of miscarriage.

===Differential diagnosis===

About 99% of HD diagnoses based on the typical symptoms and a family history of the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. Also, some autosomal recessive disorders resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.

==Management==
Treatments are available to reduce the severity of some HD symptoms. For many of these treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete. As the disease progresses, the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed multidisciplinary caregiving becomes increasingly necessary. Although relatively few studies of exercises and therapies have shown to be helpful to rehabilitate cognitive symptoms of HD, some evidence shows the usefulness of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.

===Therapy===

Weight loss and problems in eating due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly important as the disease advances. Thickening agents can be added to liquids, as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington&#x27;s disease is recommended.

People with Huntington&#x27;s disease may see a physical therapist for noninvasive and nonmedication-based ways of managing the physical symptoms. Physical therapists may implement fall risk assessment and prevention, as well as strengthening, stretching, and cardiovascular exercises. Walking aids may be prescribed as appropriate. Physical therapists also prescribe breathing exercises and airway clearance techniques with the development of respiratory problems. Consensus guidelines on physiotherapy in Huntington&#x27;s disease have been produced by the European HD Network. Goals of early rehabilitation interventions are prevention of loss of function. Participation in rehabilitation programs during the early to middle stage of the disease may be beneficial as it translates into long-term maintenance of motor and functional performance. Rehabilitation during the late stage aims to compensate for motor and functional losses. For long-term independent management, the therapist may develop home exercise programs for appropriate people.

Additionally, an increasing number of people with HD are turning to palliative care, which aims to improve quality of life through the treatment of the symptoms and stress of serious illness, in addition to their other treatments.

===Medications===

Tetrabenazine was approved in 2000 for treatment of chorea in Huntington&#x27;s disease in the EU, and in 2008 in the US. Although other drugs had been used &quot;off label&quot;, tetrabenazine was the first approved treatment for Huntington&#x27;s disease in the U.S. The compound has been known since the 1950s. An alternative to tetrabenazine is amantadine but there is limited evidence for its safety and efficacy.

Other drugs that help to reduce chorea include antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. Hypokinesia and rigidity, especially in juvenile cases, can be treated with antiparkinsonian drugs, and myoclonic hyperkinesia can be treated with valproic acid. Tentative evidence has found ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid to improve motor symptoms at one year. In 2017, deutetrabenazine, a heavier form of tetrabenazine medication for the treatment of chorea in HD, was approved by the FDA. This is marketed as Austedo.

Psychiatric symptoms can be treated with medications similar to those used in the general population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine have been recommended for depression, while atypical antipsychotics are recommended for psychosis and behavioral problems. Specialist neuropsychiatric input is recommended since people may require long-term treatment with multiple medications in combination.

=== Plant-based medications ===
There has been a number of alternative therapies experimented in ayurvedic medicine with plant-based products, although none have provided good evidence of efficacy. A recent study showed that the stromal processing peptidase (SPP), a synthetic enzyme found in plant chloroplasts, prevented the aggregation of proteins associated with Huntington&#x27;s disease. However, repeat studies and clinical validation are needed to confirm its true therapeutic potential.

===Education===

The families of individuals, and society at large, who have inherited or are at risk of inheriting HD have generations of experience of HD but may be unaware of recent breakthroughs in understanding the disease, and of the availability of genetic testing. Genetic counseling benefits these individuals by updating their knowledge, seeking to dispel any unfounded beliefs that they may have, and helping them consider their future options and plans. The Patient Education Program for Huntington&#x27;s Disease has been created to help educate family members, caretakers, and those diagnosed with Huntington&#x27;s disease. Also covered is information concerning family planning choices, care management, and other considerations.

==Prognosis==

The length of the trinucleotide repeat accounts for 60% of the variation of the age of symptoms onset and their rate of progress. A longer repeat results in an earlier age of onset and a faster progression of symptoms. Individuals with more than sixty repeats often develop the disease before age 20, while those with fewer than 40 repeats may remain asymptomatic. The remaining variation is due to environmental factors and other genes that influence the mechanism of the disease.

Life expectancy in HD is generally around 10 to 30 years following the onset of visible symptoms. Juvenile Huntington&#x27;s disease has a life expectancy rate of 10 years after onset of visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination, and to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs, and an increased risk of aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second-greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. To what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms is unclear, as they signify a desire to avoid the later stages of the disease. Suicide is the greatest risk of this disease before the diagnosis is made and in the middle stages of development throughout the disease. Other associated risks include choking; due to the inability to swallow, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.

==Epidemiology==

The late onset of Huntington&#x27;s disease means it does not usually affect reproduction. The worldwide prevalence of HD is 5–10 cases per 100,000 persons, but varies greatly geographically as a result of ethnicity, local migration and past immigration patterns. Prevalence is similar for men and women. The rate of occurrence is highest in peoples of Western European descent, averaging around seven per 100,000 people, and is lower in the rest of the world; e.g., one per million people of Asian and African descent. A 2013 epidemiological study of the prevalence of Huntington&#x27;s disease in the UK between 1990 and 2010 found that the average prevalence for the UK was 12.3 per 100,000. Additionally, some localized areas have a much higher prevalence than their regional average. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons. Other areas of high localization have been found in Tasmania and specific regions of Scotland, Wales and Sweden. Increased prevalence in some cases occurs due to a local founder effect, a historical migration of carriers into an area of geographic isolation. Some of these carriers have been traced back hundreds of years using genealogical studies. Genetic haplotypes can also give clues for the geographic variations of prevalence. Iceland, on the contrary, has a rather low prevalence of 1 per 100,000, despite the fact that Icelanders as a people are descended from the early Germanic tribes of Scandinavia which also gave rise to the Swedes; all cases with the exception of one going back nearly two centuries having derived from the offspring of a couple living early in the 19th century. Finland, as well, has a low incidence of only 2.2 per 100,000 people.

Until the discovery of a genetic test, statistics could only include clinical diagnosis based on physical symptoms and a family history of HD, excluding those who died of other causes before diagnosis. These cases can now be included in statistics; and, as the test becomes more widely available, estimates of the prevalence and incidence of the disorder are likely to increase.

==History==

In centuries past, various kinds of chorea were at times called by names such as &quot;Saint Vitus&#x27; dance&quot;, with little or no understanding of their cause or type in each case.

The first definite mention of HD was in a letter by Charles Oscar Waters (1816–1892), published in the first edition of Robley Dunglison&#x27;s &quot;Practice of Medicine&quot; in 1842. Waters described &quot;a form of chorea, vulgarly called magrums&quot;, including accurate descriptions of the chorea, its progression, and the strong heredity of the disease. In 1846 Charles Rollin Gorman (1817–1879) observed how higher prevalence seemed to occur in localized regions. Independently of Gorman and Waters, both students of Dunglison at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, (1830–1906) also produced an early description in 1860. He specifically noted that in Setesdalen, a secluded mountain valley in Norway, the high prevalence of dementia was associated with a pattern of jerking movement disorders that ran in families.

The first thorough description of the disease was by George Huntington in 1872. Examining the combined medical history of several generations of a family exhibiting similar symptoms, he realized their conditions must be linked; he presented his detailed and accurate definition of the disease as his first paper. Huntington described the exact pattern of inheritance of autosomal dominant disease years before the rediscovery by scientists of Mendelian inheritance.

Sir William Osler was interested in the disorder and chorea in general, and was impressed with Huntington&#x27;s paper, stating, &quot;In the history of medicine, there are few instances in which a disease has been more accurately, more graphically or more briefly described.&quot; Osler&#x27;s continued interest in HD, combined with his influence in the field of medicine, helped to rapidly spread awareness and knowledge of the disorder throughout the medical community. Great interest was shown by scientists in Europe, including Louis Théophile Joseph Landouzy, Désiré-Magloire Bourneville, Camillo Golgi, and Joseph Jules Dejerine, and until the end of the century, much of the research into HD was European in origin. By the end of the 19th century, research and reports on HD had been published in many countries and the disease was recognized as a worldwide condition.

During the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance at the turn of the 20th century, HD was used tentatively as an example of autosomal dominant inheritance. English biologist William Bateson used the pedigrees of affected families to establish that HD had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The strong inheritance pattern prompted several researchers, including Smith Ely Jelliffe, to attempt to trace and connect family members of previous studies. Jelliffe collected information from across New York and published several articles regarding the genealogy of HD in New England. Jelliffe&#x27;s research roused the interest of his college friend, Charles Davenport, who commissioned Elizabeth Muncey to produce the first field study on the East Coast of the United States of families with HD and to construct their pedigrees. Davenport used this information to document the variable age of onset and range of symptoms of HD; he claimed that most cases of HD in the US could be traced back to a handful of individuals. This research was further embellished in 1932 by P. R. Vessie, who popularized the idea that three brothers who left England in 1630 bound for Boston were the progenitors of HD in the US. The claim that the earliest progenitors had been established and eugenic bias of Muncey&#x27;s, Davenport&#x27;s, and Vessie&#x27;s work contributed to misunderstandings and prejudice about HD. Muncey and Davenport also popularized the idea that in the past, some with HD may have been thought to be possessed by spirits or victims of witchcraft, and were sometimes shunned or exiled by society. This idea has not been proven. Researchers have found contrary evidence; for instance, the community of the family studied by George Huntington openly accommodated those who exhibited symptoms of HD.

The search for the cause of this condition was enhanced considerably in 1968, when the Hereditary Disease Foundation (HDF) was created by Milton Wexler, a psychoanalyst based in Los Angeles, California, whose wife Leonore Sabin had been diagnosed earlier that year with Huntington&#x27;s disease. The three brothers of Wexler&#x27;s wife also had this disease.

The foundation was involved in the recruitment of more than 100 scientists in the US-Venezuela Huntington&#x27;s Disease Collaborative Project, which over a 10-year period from 1979, worked to locate the genetic cause. This was achieved in 1983 when a causal gene was approximately located, and in 1993, the gene was precisely located at chromosome 4 (4p16.3). The study had focused on the populations of two isolated Venezuelan villages, Barranquitas and Lagunetas, where there was an unusually high prevalence of HD, and involved over 18,000 people, mostly from a single extended family, and resulted in making HD the first autosomal disease locus found using genetic linkage analysis. Among other innovations, the project developed DNA-marking methods which were an important step in making the Human Genome Project possible.

In the same time, key discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the disorder were being made, including the findings by Anita Harding&#x27;s research group on the effects of the gene&#x27;s length.

Modelling the disease in various types of animals, such as the transgenic mouse developed in 1996, enabled larger-scale experiments. As these animals have faster metabolisms and much shorter lifespans than humans results from experiments are received sooner, speeding research. The 1997 discovery that mHtt fragments misfold led to the discovery of the nuclear inclusions they cause. These advances have led to increasingly extensive research into the proteins involved with the disease, potential drug treatments, care methods, and the gene itself.

The networks of care and support that had developed in Venezuela and Colombia during the research projects there in the 1970s through 2000s were eventually eroded by various forces, such as the ongoing crisis in Venezuela and the death of a lead researcher in Colombia (Jorge Daza Barriga). Doctors are working toward rekindling these networks because the people who have contributed to the science of Huntington&#x27;s disease by participating in these studies deserve adequate follow-up care; societies elsewhere in the world who benefit from the scientific advances thus achieved owe at least that much to those who participated in the research.

The condition was formerly called Huntington&#x27;s chorea, but this term has been replaced by Huntington&#x27;s disease because not all patients develop chorea and due to the importance of cognitive and behavioral problems.

==Society and culture==
===Ethics===
Genetic testing for Huntington&#x27;s disease has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.

The development of an accurate diagnostic test for Huntington&#x27;s disease has caused social, legal, and ethical concerns over access to and use of a person&#x27;s results.
Many guidelines and testing procedures have strict procedures for disclosure and confidentiality to allow individuals to decide when and how to receive their results and also to whom the results are made available. Insurance companies and businesses are faced with the question of whether to use genetic test results when assessing an individual, such as for life insurance or employment. The United Kingdom&#x27;s insurance companies agreed with the Department of Health and Social Care that until 2017 customers would not need to disclose predictive genetics tests to them, but this agreement explicitly excluded the government-approved test for Huntington&#x27;s when writing policies with a value over . As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform presymptomatic testing on a child or adolescent since there would be no medical benefit for that individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that parents have a right to make the decision on their child&#x27;s behalf. With the lack of effective treatment, testing a person under legal age who is not judged to be competent is considered unethical in most cases.

There are ethical concerns related to prenatal genetic testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis to ensure a child is not born with a given disease. For example, prenatal testing raises the issue of selective abortion, a choice considered unacceptable by some. As it is a dominant disease, there are difficulties in situations in which a parent does not want to know his or her own diagnosis. This would require parts of the process to be kept secret from the parent.

===Support organizations===

In 1968, after experiencing HD in his wife&#x27;s family, Dr. Milton Wexler was inspired to start the Hereditary Disease Foundation (HDF), with the aim of curing genetic illnesses by coordinating and supporting research. The foundation and Wexler&#x27;s daughter, Nancy Wexler, were key parts of the research team in Venezuela which discovered the HD gene.

At roughly the same time as the HDF formed, Marjorie Guthrie helped to found the committee to Combat Huntington&#x27;s Disease (now the Huntington&#x27;s Disease Society of America), after her husband, folk singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie died from complications of HD.

Since then, support and research organizations have formed in many countries around the world and have helped to increase public awareness of HD. A number of these collaborate in umbrella organizations, like the International Huntington Association and the European HD network. Many support organizations hold an annual HD awareness event, some of which have been endorsed by their respective governments. For example, 6 June is designated &quot;National Huntington&#x27;s Disease Awareness Day&quot; by the US Senate. Many organizations exist to support and inform those affected by HD, including the Huntington&#x27;s Disease Association in the UK. The largest funder of research is provided by the Cure Huntington&#x27;s Disease Initiative Foundation (CHDI).

==Research directions==

Research into the mechanism of HD is focused on identifying the functioning of Htt, how mHtt differs or interferes with it, and the brain pathology that the disease produces. Research is conducted using &quot;in vitro&quot; methods, genetically modified animals, (also called transgenic animal models), and human volunteers. Animal models are critical for understanding the fundamental mechanisms causing the disease, and for supporting the early stages of drug development. The identification of the causative gene has enabled the development of many genetically modified organisms including nematodes (roundworms), &quot;Drosophila&quot; fruit flies, and genetically modified mammals including mice, rats, sheep, pigs and monkeys that express mutant huntingtin and develop progressive neurodegeneration and HD-like symptoms.

Research is being conducted using many approaches to either prevent Huntington&#x27;s disease or slow its progression. Disease-modifying strategies can be broadly grouped into three categories: reducing the level of the mutant huntingtin protein (including gene splicing and gene silencing); approaches aimed at improving neuronal survival by reducing the harm caused by the protein to specific cellular pathways and mechanisms (including protein homeostasis and histone deacetylase inhibition); and strategies to replace lost neurons. In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include phosphodiesterase inhibitors.

The CHDI Foundation funds a great many research initiatives providing many publications. The CHDI foundation is the largest funder of Huntington&#x27;s disease research globally and aims to find and develop drugs that will slow the progression of HD. CHDI was formerly known as the High Q Foundation. In 2006, it spent $50 million on Huntington&#x27;s disease research. CHDI collaborates with many academic and commercial laboratories globally and engages in oversight and management of research projects as well as funding.

===Reducing huntingtin production===

Gene silencing aims to reduce the production of the mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHtt is reduced, symptoms improve. The safety of RNA interference, and allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) methods of gene silencing has been demonstrated in mice and the larger primate macaque brain. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant htt while leaving wild-type Htt untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first gene silencing trial involving humans with HD began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified for the first time in cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington&#x27;s disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel &quot;single-molecule counting&quot; immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. A phase 3 trial of this compound, renamed tominersen and sponsored by Roche Pharmaceuticals, began in 2019 but was halted in 2021 after the safety monitoring board concluded that the risk-benefit balance was unfavourable. A huntingtin-lowering gene therapy trial run by Uniqure began in 2019, and several trials of orally administered huntingtin-lowering splicing modulator compounds have been announced. Gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9. PTC Therapeutics is evaluating small molecules that induce poison exon inclusion in &quot;HTT&quot; transcript as a therapeutic strategy to lower &quot;HTT&quot; expression.

===Increasing huntingtin clearance===
Another strategy to reduce the level of mutant huntingtin is to increase the rate at which cells are able to clear it. As mHtt (and many other protein aggregates) are degraded by autophagy, increasing the rate of autophagy has the potential to reduce levels of mHtt and thereby ameliorate disease. Pharmacological and genetic inducers of autophagy have been tested in a variety of Huntington&#x27;s disease models; many have been shown to reduce mHtt levels and decrease toxicity.

===Improving cell survival===
Among the approaches aimed at improving cell survival in the presence of mutant huntingtin are correction of transcriptional regulation using histone deacetylase inhibitors, modulating aggregation of huntingtin, improving metabolism and mitochondrial function and restoring function of synapses.

===Neuronal replacement===
Stem-cell therapy is used to replace damaged neurons by transplantation of stem cells into affected regions of the brain. Experiments in animal models (rats and mice only) have yielded positive results.

Whatever their future therapeutic potential, stem cells are already a valuable tool for studying Huntington&#x27;s disease in the laboratory.

===Ferroptosis===
Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides to lethal levels. ALOX5-mediated ferroptosis acts as a cell death pathway upon oxidative stress in Huntington&#x27;s disease. Inhibitors of ferroptosis are protective in models of degenerative brain disorders, including
Parkinson&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s, and Alzheimer&#x27;s Diseases.

===Clinical trials===
In 2020, there were 197 clinical trials related to varied therapies and biomarkers for Huntington&#x27;s disease listed as either underway, recruiting or newly completed. Compounds trialled that have failed to prevent or slow the progression of Huntington&#x27;s disease include remacemide, coenzyme Q10, riluzole, creatine, minocycline, ethyl-EPA, phenylbutyrate and dimebon.

<text>Roguelike (or rogue-like) is a style of role-playing game traditionally characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, and permanent death of the player character. Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative, reflecting the influence of tabletop role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

Though &quot;Beneath Apple Manor&quot; predates it, the 1980 game &quot;Rogue&quot;, which is an ASCII based game that runs in terminal or terminal emulator, is considered the forerunner and the namesake of the genre, with derivative games mirroring &quot;Rogue&quot;s character- or sprite-based graphics. These games were popularized among college students and computer programmers of the 1980s and 1990s, leading to hundreds of variants. Some of the better-known variants include &quot;Hack&quot;, &quot;NetHack&quot;, &quot;Ancient Domains of Mystery&quot;, &quot;Moria&quot;, &quot;Angband&quot;, &quot;Tales of Maj&#x27;Eyal&quot;, and &quot;Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup&quot;. The Japanese series of &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; games by Chunsoft, inspired by &quot;Rogue&quot;, also fall within the concept of roguelike games.

The exact definition of a roguelike game remains a point of debate in the video game community. A &quot;Berlin Interpretation&quot; drafted in 2008 defined a number of high- and low-value factors of &quot;canon&quot; roguelike games &quot;Rogue&quot;, &quot;NetHack&quot; and &quot;Angband&quot;, which have since been used to distinguish these roguelike games from edge cases like &quot;Diablo&quot;. Since then, with more powerful home computers and gaming systems and the rapid growth of indie video game development, several new &quot;roguelikes&quot; have appeared, with some but not all of these high-value factors, nominally the use of procedural generation and permadeath, while often incorporating other gameplay genres, thematic elements, and graphical styles; common examples of these include &quot;Spelunky&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Binding of Isaac&quot;, &quot;Slay the Spire&quot;, &quot;Crypt of the NecroDancer&quot;, and &quot;Hades&quot;. To distinguish these from traditional roguelikes, such games may be referred to as &quot;rogue-lite&quot; or &quot;roguelike-like&quot;. Despite this alternative naming suggestion, these games are often referred to as roguelike and use the roguelike tag on various market places such as Steam.

== Origin ==

The term &quot;roguelike&quot; came from Usenet newsgroups around 1993, as this was the principal channel the players of roguelike games of that period were using to discuss these games, as well as what the developers used to announce new releases and even distribute the game&#x27;s source code in some cases. With several individual groups for each game, it was suggested that with rising popularity of &quot;Rogue&quot;, &quot;Hack&quot;, &quot;Moria&quot;, and &quot;Angband&quot;, all of which shared common elements, that the groups be consolidated under an umbrella term to facilitate cross-game discussion. Debate among users of these groups ensued to try to find an encapsulating term that described the common elements, starting with codice_1, but after three weeks of discussion, codice_2, based on &quot;Rogue&quot;, which was at the time considered to be the oldest of these types of games, was picked as &quot;the least of all available evils&quot;. By the time it was suggested that a group be created to discuss the development of these kind of games in 1998, the &quot;roguelike&quot; term was already established within the community. This usage parallels that of &quot;Doom clone&quot;, a term used in 1990s that later evolved into more generic &quot;first-person shooter&quot;.

==Gameplay and design==
Drawing from the concepts of tabletop role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, nearly all roguelikes give the player control of a character, which they may customize by selecting a class, race, and gender, and adjusting attributes points and skills. At the start of the game, the character is placed at the top-most level of a dungeon, with basic equipment such as a simple weapon, armor, torches, and food. Following along the role-playing concept of a dungeon crawl, the player moves the character through the dungeon, collecting treasure which can include new weapons, armours, magical devices, potions, scrolls, food, and money, while having to fight monsters that roam the dungeon. Most combat is performed simply by attempting to move the character into the same space as the monster. The game then calculates the damage that the character and monster deal. Other types of attacks, such as firing an arrow or performing an offensive magic spell, can often be performed as well.

Defeating monsters earns the character experience points, and after earning enough points, the character will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. The character dies if they lose all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents the end of the game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.

The player generally has to explore the dungeon to reveal its contents, similar to a fog of war. Many roguelikes include visibility elements, such as a torch to provide illumination to see monsters in nearby squares, or line of sight to limit which monsters are visible from the player&#x27;s position. Dungeons tend to be connected by stairs; lower dungeon levels generally are more difficult than higher ones, so that an underdeveloped character will have difficulty progressing too fast. Dungeon levels and the population of monsters and treasure within them are generated randomly using procedural generation, so no game is the same on subsequent playthroughs. Most roguelikes have an ultimate goal of either claiming an item located at the deepest level of the dungeon, or defeating a specific monster that lives on that level. Typical roguelikes assess the player&#x27;s performance at the end of the game through a score based on the amount of treasure, money, experience earned, and how fast the player finished the game, if they managed to do so. The score is displayed in a ranked scoreboard to compare the player&#x27;s performance on successive runs.

===Key features===


What gameplay elements explicitly define a &quot;roguelike&quot; game remains a point of debate within the video game community. There is broad agreement that roguelike games incorporate gameplay elements popularized by the text-based game &quot;Rogue&quot; (1980), which bore out many variations due to its success; As of 2015, several hundred games claiming to be roguelikes were available through the Steam game catalog, and the user-run wiki RogueBasin tracks hundreds of roguelikes and their development.

Some players and developers sought a more narrow definition for &quot;roguelike&quot; as variations on &quot;Rogue&quot; introduced new concepts or eschewed other principles that they felt moved the games away from the flavor of what &quot;Rogue&quot; was. At the International Roguelike Development Conference 2008 held in Berlin, Germany, players and developers established a definition for roguelikes known as the &quot;Berlin Interpretation&quot;. The Berlin Interpretation set out a set of high-value and low-value factors, basing these lists on five canon roguelike games: &quot;ADOM&quot;, &quot;Angband&quot;, &quot;Linley&#x27;s Dungeon Crawl&quot;, &quot;NetHack&quot;, and &quot;Rogue&quot;. The Interpretation was designed to determine &quot;how roguelike a game is&quot;, noting that missing a factor does not eliminate a game from being a roguelike, nor does possessing the features make a game roguelike. John Harris of &quot;Game Set Watch&quot; exemplified this by using these criteria to numerically score some seemingly roguelike games; &quot;Linley&#x27;s Dungeon Crawl&quot; and &quot;NetHack&quot; scored highest, earning 57.5 points of 60 available based on the Interpretation, while &quot;Toe Jam &amp; Earl&quot; and &quot;Diablo&quot;, games commonly compared to roguelikes, earned only about half of the points.

The Berlin Interpretation defined nine high-value factors:
* The game uses random dungeon generation to increase replayability. Games may include pre-determined levels such as a town level common to the &quot;Moria&quot; family where the player can buy and sell equipment, but these are considered to reduce the randomness set by the Berlin Interpretation. This &quot;random generation&quot; is nearly always based on some procedural generation approach rather than true randomness. Procedural generation uses a set of rules defined by the game developers to seed the generation of the dungeon generally to assure that each level of the dungeon can be completed by the player without special equipment, and also can generate more aesthetically pleasing levels. In addition, the appearances of magical items may vary from run to run. For example, a &quot;bubbly&quot; potion might heal wounds one game, then poison the player character in the next.
* The game uses permadeath. Once a character dies, the player must begin a new game, known as a &quot;run&quot;, which will regenerate the game&#x27;s levels anew due to procedural generation. A &quot;save game&quot; feature will only provide suspension of gameplay and not a limitlessly recoverable state; the stored session is deleted upon resumption or character death. Players can circumvent this by backing up stored game data (&quot;save scumming&quot;), an act that is usually considered cheating; the developers of &quot;Rogue&quot; introduced the permadeath feature after introducing a save function, finding that players were repeatedly loading saved games to achieve the best results. According to &quot;Rogue&quot;″s Michael Toy, they saw their approach to permadeath not as a means to make the game painful or difficult but to put weight on every decision the player made as to create a more immersive experience.
* The game is turn-based, giving the player as much time as needed to make a decision. Gameplay is usually step-based, where player actions are performed serially and take a variable measure of in-game time to complete. Game processes (e.g., monster movement and interaction, progressive effects such as poisoning or starvation) advance based on the passage of time dictated by these actions.
* The game is grid-based. Gameplay takes place on a uniform grid of tiles. This is usually presented in an ASCII representation of the dungeon.
* The game is non-modal, in that every action should be available to the player regardless of where they are in the game. The Interpretation notes that shops like in &quot;Angband&quot; do break this non-modality.
* The game has a degree of complexity due to the number of different game systems in place that allow the player to complete certain goals in multiple ways, creating emergent gameplay. For example, to get through a locked door, the player may attempt to pick the lock, kick it down, burn down the door, or even tunnel around it, depending on their current situation and inventory. A common phrase associated with &quot;NetHack&quot; is &quot;The Dev Team Thinks of Everything&quot; in that the developers seem to have anticipated every possible combination of actions that a player may attempt to try in their gameplay strategy, such as using gloves to protect one&#x27;s character while wielding the corpse of a cockatrice as a weapon to petrify enemies by its touch.
* The player must use resource management to survive. Items that help sustain the player, such as food and healing items, are in limited supply, and the player must figure out how to use these most advantageously to survive in the dungeon. &quot;USGamer&quot; further considers &quot;stamina decay&quot; as another feature related to resource management. The player&#x27;s character constantly needs to find food to avoid starvation, which prevents the player from exploiting health regeneration by simply either passing turns for a long period of time or fighting very weak monsters at low level dungeons. Rich Carlson, one of the creators of an early roguelike-like &quot;Strange Adventures in Infinite Space&quot;, called this aspect a sort of &quot;clock&quot;, imposing some type of deadline or limitation on how much the player can explore and creating tension in the game.
* The game is focused on hack and slash-based gameplay, where the goal is to kill many monsters, and where other peaceful options do not exist.
* The game requires the player to explore the world, and discover the purpose of unidentified items. In games featuring random generation, this must be done again every playthrough, as both the map and the appearances of items change.

Low-value factors from the Berlin Interpretation are:
* The game is based on controlling only a single character throughout one playthrough.
* Monsters have behavior that is similar to the player-character, such as the ability to pick up items and use them, or cast spells.
* The game aimed to provide a tactical challenge that may require players to play through several times to learn the appropriate tactics for survival.
* The game involves exploring dungeons which are made up of rooms and interconnecting corridors. Some games may have open areas or natural features, such as rivers, though these are considered against the Berlin Interpretation.
* The game presents the status of the player and the game through numbers on the game&#x27;s screen/interface.

Though this is not addressed by the Berlin Interpretation, roguelikes are generally single-player games. On multi-user systems, leaderboards are often shared between players. Some roguelikes allow traces of former player characters to appear in later game sessions in the form of ghosts or grave markings. Some games such as NetHack even have the player&#x27;s former characters reappear as enemies within the dungeon. Multi-player turn-based derivatives such as &quot;TomeNET&quot;, &quot;MAngband&quot;, and &quot;Crossfire&quot; do exist and are playable online.

===Early roguelikes===

Early roguelikes were developed to be played on text-based user interfaces, commonly UNIX-based computer mainframes and terminals used at colleges and universities before transitioning to personal computers. Games used a mix of ASCII or ANSI characters to visually represent elements of the dungeon levels, creatures, and items on the level as in ASCII art. These games typically included one or two text lines presenting the player&#x27;s current status at the bottom of the screen, and text-based menu screens to manage inventory, statistics, and other details.

The player&#x27;s character was nearly always represented by the codice_3 character across text-based roguelikes, which had been chosen by the developers of &quot;Rogue&quot; to stand for &quot;where you&#x27;re at&quot;. Other common examples would include codice_4 for monetary treasure and codice_5 for a dragon. Later games would take advantage of colour-based text graphics to increase the variation of creature types, such as a red codice_5 for a red dragon that would shoot fire, while a green codice_5 could indicate a green dragon that would shoot acid. Players would use the keyboard, using one keypress to enter a command. Sociologist Mark R. Johnson described these commonality of symbols and glyphs as semiotic codes that gave an &quot;aesthetic construction of nostalgia&quot; by &quot;depicting textual symbols as aesthetic forms in their own right&quot; and consistency across multiple roguelikes.

With modern computer systems, users developed alternate means of displaying the game, such as graphical tilesets and Isometric-based graphical front ends, as well as interfaces that took advantage of keyboard and mouse UI controls, but otherwise still kept to the core tile-based gameplay.

As computers offered more advanced user interfaces, such as windows and point-and-click menus, many traditional roguelikes were modified to include support for having multiple windows. This was useful to not only show the character-based dungeon, but details on the character&#x27;s inventory, the monster they were in battle with, and other status messages, in separate windows. Having access to multiple windows also allowed having menus to complete more complex commands. More recent examples of roguelikes that have stayed with ASCII art-based displays include &quot;Cogmind&quot; (2017) and &quot;&quot; (2013).

===Rogue-lites and procedural death labyrinths===
With computers and video game consoles capable of more advanced graphics and gameplay, numerous games have emerged that are loosely based on the classic roguelike design but diverge in one or more features. Many of these games use the concepts of procedurally generated maps and permadeath, while moving away from tile-based movement and turn-based gameplay, often using another gameplay genre such as action games or platformers. Other titles deriving from roguelike games are based on the observation that the traditional roguelikes are difficult with a steep learning curve, and a player may never complete these games over numerous play sessions, making these titles difficult to sell to a broader audience. These new games would include elements to reduce the difficulty as to draw in a larger audience.

Many games with some of the Berlin Interpretation elements call themselves &quot;roguelike&quot;, but bear little resemblance to the original &quot;Rogue&quot;, causing confusion and dilution of the term. Some players of the Berlin Interpretation roguelikes disliked the dilution of the term, believing that in the 1990s and 2000s, the term &quot;roguelikes&quot; served well to distinguish games that forwent aesthetics to focus on depth of gameplay from games more comparable to interactive movies, particularly games that incorporated real-time gameplay elements which tended to reduce the game&#x27;s complexity. As such, the term &quot;rogue-lite&quot; or &quot;roguelike-like&quot; has been used by some to distinguish these games that possess some, but not all, of the Berlin Interpretation features from those that exactly meet the Berlin roguelike definition. The phrase &quot;procedural death labyrinth&quot; has also been applied to such games, as they retain the notion of permadeath and random level generation but lack the other high-value factors normally associated with roguelike games.

Rogue-lites favor short gameplay runs with victory conditions, in contrast to some traditional roguelikes that can be played indefinitely. The shortness of a single gameplay run in rogue-lites can motivate players to continually replay the game in the hope of reaching completion, making replayability a high-value factor in these types of games. Game journalist Joshua Bycer observed that several games considered as rogue-lites feature fixed events, even if the means to reach that may be through procedural generation, whereas a roguelike game typically lacks this level of predictability. For example, several rogue-lites require the player to travel a fixed number of biomes, each which culminates in a boss fight, such as &quot;Rogue Legacy&quot;. Associated with their short length, many rogue-lites feature a metagame, whereby achieving certain goals will unlock persistent features such as the ability to select a new character at the start of the game or the addition of new items and monsters in the procedural generation of the game&#x27;s levels. Alternatively, each run through rogue-lite may be to collect resources which one then advances their character within the metagame, and a player may simply forgo a complete run once they have collected sufficient materials for that advancement.

Several rogue-lites feature daily challenges, in which a preset random seed is used to generate the game&#x27;s levels in a deterministic fashion so that each player will have the same encounters; players attempt to complete the game through those levels or otherwise get the highest score through online leaderboards. Rogue-lites may also allow the player to enter the random seed directly as to be able to rechallenge the same set of levels or share a difficult set of levels with other players.

&quot;US Gamer&quot; further identified games they consider edge cases of being roguelikes or rogue-lites, as they are inspired by &quot;Rogue&quot;, and &quot;that stray a bit further from the genre but still manage to scratch the same itch as a great roguelike&quot;. These include games such as the &quot;Diablo&quot; series, &quot;ToeJam &amp; Earl&quot;, and &quot;Dwarf Fortress&quot;, the latter of which retains the classic ASCII art-approach to gameplay as traditional roguelikes. &quot;Ars Technica&quot; writer Richard C. Moss alternatively suggested that the term &quot;roguelike&quot; is less necessarily about any specific genre definition but instead the idea that &quot;games can be deep, inventive, challenging, and endlessly compelling experiences through their rules and their systems alone&quot;.

===Subgenres within roguelikes===
In considering the popularity of roguelikes that deviate from the Berlin Interpretation, the rogue-lites, some subgenres have emerged.
Action roguelikes are typically based on combining gameplay of action games within roguelikes instead of the turn-based gameplay. &quot;Spelunky&quot; is an example of combining a platform game with the roguelike formula, while &quot;The Binding of Isaac&quot; and &quot;Enter the Gungeon&quot; are effective roguelike shooter games. Within action roguelikes have also emerged a minimalistic shooter roguelike, with &quot;Vampire Survivors&quot; as a leading example; in such games, the player generally fights through wave after wave of enemies, their character often fully firing or using all possible attacks without player intervention, with the ability to expand their character through a random selection of power-ups as they defeat more enemies.

Another type of roguelike subgenre is the roguelike deck-builder, where combat is resolved by using cards or an equivalent object. These games are inspired by physical living card games, where the player builds their deck over the course of the game, forcing them to plan strategy on the fly. While the 2014 game &quot;Dream Quest&quot; is considered the first example of such a video game, the popularity of the genre was cemented with &quot;Slay the Spire&quot; in 2017.

==History==
===Early history (1975–1980)===
The creation of roguelike games came from hobbyist programmers and computer hackers, attempting to create games for the nascent computer field in the early 1980s, particularly influenced by the 1975 text adventure game &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; (often simply titled &quot;Adventure&quot;, or &quot;advent&quot; on filesystems without long filenames), and from the high fantasy setting of the tabletop game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Some elements of the roguelike genre were present in dungeon crawlers written for the PLATO system. This includes &quot;pedit5&quot; (1975) believed to be the first dungeon crawl game, and featured random monster encounters, though only used a single fixed dungeon level. &quot;pedit5&quot; inspired similar PLATO-based dungeon crawlers &quot;dnd&quot; (1975), &quot;orthanc&quot; (1978), &quot;Moria&quot; (1978), and &quot;avatar&quot; (1979). It is unclear if these PLATO games inspired the roguelike genre as there is no evidence that the early roguelike creators had access to these games. The core roguelike games were developed independently of each other, many of the developers not learning about their respective projects until several years after the genre took off.

Roguelike games were initially developed for computing environments with limited memory, including shared mainframe systems and early home computers; this limitation prevented developers from retaining all but a few dungeon levels in memory while the game was running, leading to procedural generation to avoid the memory storage issue. Procedural generation led to high replayability, as no two games were alike.

====Concurrent variants====
Though the term &quot;roguelike&quot; derives from the 1980 game &quot;Rogue&quot;, the first known game with the core roguelike gameplay elements was &quot;Beneath Apple Manor&quot; (1978), written by Don Worth for the Apple II; &quot;Beneath Apple Manor&quot; is also recognized as the first commercial roguelike game. The game, inspired by Worth&#x27;s enjoyment of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; roleplaying, included procedural generation using a modification of the random maze generator from the game &quot;Dragon Maze&quot;, role-playing elements for the characters, tile-based movement and turn-based combat. Though &quot;Beneath Apple Manor&quot; predated &quot;Rogue&quot;, it was not as popular as &quot;Rogue&quot;: &quot;Rogue&quot; had advantage of being distributed over ARPANET which many college students had easy access to, while &quot;Beneath Apple Manor&quot; was packaged and sold by hand by Worth either at local stores or through mail fulfillment.

Another early roguelike whose development pre-dated &quot;Rogue&quot; was &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot; (1982), developed by Jeff McCord starting in 1979. The game was based on &quot;GammaQuest&quot;, an earlier title McCord had created on the Commodore PET which he shared locally with friends while a student at Henry Clay High School in Kentucky; the game itself was based on a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign he had run himself in the prior years. Before graduating and attending the University of Tennessee in 1981, he had started work on &quot;GammaQuest II&quot;, which required the player to navigate through randomly generated dungeon levels, acquire a sword, and make it back to the surface with that sword through more randomly generated levels. The more advanced computers available at the school, such as the VIC-20, enabled him to expand out the game further from the highly limited memory on the PET. On seeing the prospects of selling computer software, he eventually got a publication deal with Epyx, where they helped him to refine the marketing of the game, renaming it &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot;, and giving him access to the more powerful Commodore 64, enabling him to use graphics and sound as part of the game. The game was considered a success, and when it was ported to the PC in 1983, it out-shone &quot;Rogue&quot;″s PC release the same year due to &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot;″s superior graphics and sound.

====&quot;Rogue&quot;====
&quot;Rogue&quot; was written by Glenn Wichman and Michael Toy in 1980 while students at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The game was inspired by Toy&#x27;s prior experience in playing the 1971 &quot;Star Trek&quot; game and programming clones of it for various other computer systems. It was also inspired by interactive fiction &quot;Adventure&quot;. While looking for a way to randomize the experience of &quot;Adventure&quot;, they came across Ken Arnold&#x27;s curses library that enabled them to better manipulate characters on the terminal screen, prompting Toy and Wichman to create a graphical-like randomized adventure game. They created the story of the game by having the player seek out the &quot;Amulet of Yendor&quot;, &quot;Yendor&quot; being &quot;Rodney&quot; spelled backwards, the name of the wizard they envisioned had created the dungeon. &quot;Rogue&quot; was originally executed on a VAX-11/780 computer; its limited memory forced them to use a simple text-based interface for the game. Toy eventually dropped out of school but got a job at the computing labs at University of California, Berkeley, where he met with Arnold. Arnold helped to optimize the curses code and implement more features into the game.

&quot;Rogue&quot; proved popular with college students and computer researchers at the time, including Ken Thompson; Dennis Ritchie had joked at the time that &quot;Rogue&quot; was &quot;the biggest waste of CPU cycles in history&quot;. Its popularity led to the game&#x27;s inclusion on BSD UNIX v4.2 in 1984, though at that time, without its source code. Toy and Arnold had anticipated selling &quot;Rogue&quot; commercially and were hesitant about releasing it; Toy would go on to meet Jon Lane at Olivetti, and together they would go on to create the company A.I. Design to port the games for various home systems along with publishing support by Epyx, later bringing Wichman back to help.

===Following evolution (1980–1995)===





The hierarchy of the major Roguelike games that are known to descend from &quot;Rogue&quot;. Solid lines represent games developed from the parent&#x27;s source code, while dotted lines represent games that were inspired by the parent game.
The popularity of &quot;Rogue&quot; led developers to create their own versions of the game, though their efforts were originally limited by the lack of access to &quot;Rogue&quot;″s source, which was not released until BSD v4.3 in 1986. These developers resorted to building games from scratch similar to &quot;Rogue&quot; but with features that they wanted to see. These versions would be distributed with source code, and along with the original &quot;Rogue&quot; source, other developers were able to create software forks of the games, adding in new monsters, items, and gameplay features, creating several dozen variants. This process was aided by switching code to languages with better data typing, including object-oriented and scripting languages, and cleaning up and modularizing the code so that contributors can better follow where changes can be made.

While there are some direct variants of &quot;Rogue&quot;, such as &quot;Brogue&quot;, most variants of &quot;Rogue&quot; could be classified into two branches based on two key games, &quot;Moria&quot; and &quot;Hack&quot;, that were developed in the spirit of &quot;Rogue&quot;.

====&quot;Moria&quot;-based====
&quot;Moria&quot; (1983) was developed by Robert Alan Koeneke while a student at University of Oklahoma, inspired by both &quot;Adventure&quot; and &quot;Rogue&quot;. Having access to a VAX-11/780, but without the source to &quot;Rogue&quot; due to computer administrator restrictions, he began trying to recreate &quot;Rogue&quot; but specifically flavored with the complex cave maze of the same name in J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle Earth stories. Following Tolkien&#x27;s fiction, the player&#x27;s goal was to descend to the depths of Moria to defeat the Balrog, akin to a boss battle. As with &quot;Rogue&quot;, levels were not persistent: when the player left the level and then tried to return, a new level would be procedurally generated. Among other improvements to &quot;Rogue&quot;, Koeneke included a persistent town at the highest level where players could buy and sell equipment, and the use of data structures within the Pascal language allowed him to create a more diverse bestiary within the game. He got help from several playtesters as well as another student, Jimmey Wayne Todd, who helped to program a deeper character generation system. &quot;UMoria&quot; (short for &quot;UNIX Moria&quot;) is a close variation on &quot;Moria&quot; by Jim E. Wilson, making the game more portable to a larger variety of computers while fixing various bugs.
&quot;Angband&quot; (1990) was developed by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played &quot;UMoria&quot;, they wanted to expand the game even further. Working from &quot;UMoria&quot;″s code, they increased the number of levels and monsters, flavored the game based on Angband, the massive fortress controlled by Morgoth from Tolkien&#x27;s fiction, and incorporated more of the deadlier creatures described within the Middle Earth mythology. They kept the Balrog as a difficult creature that must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following Cutler and Astrand&#x27;s graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game through to a public release outside of the university, adding in elements such as giving the player a sense of the rewards and dangers of a level when they entered it the first time.

Once &quot;Angband&quot; was released to the public via USENET, there were efforts to have code maintainers (the &quot;devteam&quot;) to fix bugs, clean up the code and implement suggestions into the code. Due to numerous shifts in those maintaining the code (due to other obligations), and the number of potential user suggestions to include, &quot;Angband&quot; would become highly forked, leading to a number of &quot;Angband&quot; variants; at least sixty known variants exist with about a half dozen still under active development. One significant fork was &quot;ZAngband&quot; (1994) (short for &quot;Zelazny Angband&quot;), which expanded on &quot;Angband&quot; and altered the theme towards Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Amber&quot;. The &quot;ZAngband&quot; codebase would be used to create &quot;Troubles of Middle Earth&quot; (&quot;ToME&quot;) in 2002, which later swapped out the Tolkien and Zelazny fiction setting for a new original one to become &quot;Tales of Maj&#x27;Eyal&quot; (2009). The vanilla &quot;Angband&quot; remains in development today by the devteam.

====&quot;Hack&quot;-based====
&quot;Hack&quot; (1982) was developed by Jay Fenlason with help from Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome, and Jonathan Payne, students at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School at the time, while participating in the school&#x27;s computer lab overseen by Brian Harvey. Harvey had been able to acquire a PDP-11/70 minicomputer for the school and instituted a course curriculum that allowed students to do whatever they wanted on the computers, including playing games, as long as they had completed assignments by the end of each semester. Fenlason, Woodland, Thome, and Payne met through these courses and became a close group of friends and competent programmers. Harvey had invited the group to the computer labs at UC Berkeley where they had the opportunity to use the mainframe systems there, and were introduced to &quot;Rogue&quot;, inspiring them to create their own version as their class project. Fenlason had created a list of features they wanted to improve upon in &quot;Rogue&quot; such as having a level&#x27;s layout saved once the player moved off that level. They approached Toy and Arnold at a local USENIX conference for the source code to &quot;Rogue&quot;, but were refused, forcing them to develop the routines from scratch. The resulting program, &quot;Hack&quot;, stayed true to the original &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; influences, and derived its name from being both a &quot;hack and slash&quot; game as well as a programming hack to recreate &quot;Rogue&quot; without having access to its source code. Fenlason was not able to include all the desired features, and his involvement in &quot;Hack&quot;″s development concluded after the students had left the school. Fenlason had provided the source code to &quot;Hack&quot; to the USENIX conferences to be distributed on their digital tapes, from which it was later discovered and built upon through USENET newsgroups, porting it to various systems. Like &quot;Angband&quot;, the maintainership of the &quot;Hack&quot; code passed through several hands, and some variants were created by different forks.
&quot;Hack&quot; would eventually be dropped in favor of &quot;NetHack&quot; (1987). When Mike Stephenson, an analyst at a computer hardware manufacturer, took maintainership of &quot;Hack&quot;″s code, he improved it, taking suggestions from Izchak Miller, a philosophy professor at University of Pennsylvania, and Janet Walz, another computer hacker. Calling themselves the DevTeam, they began to make major modifications to &quot;Hack&quot;″s code. They named their new version &quot;NetHack&quot;, in part due to their collaboration over the game being done through USENET. &quot;NetHack&quot;″s major deviations from &quot;Hack&quot; were the introduction of a wider variety of monsters, borrowing from other mythologies and lores, including anachronistic and contemporary cultural elements (such as a tourist class with a flash-bulb camera inspired by Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series) in the high fantasy setting, and the use of pre-defined levels with some procedural elements that the player would encounter deeper in the dungeons. Further iterations of the game included branching pathways through the dungeon and optional character-based quests that could grant the player an extremely useful item to complete the game. Though the DevTeam released the code publicly, they carefully maintained who could contribute to the code base to avoid excessive forking of the vanilla game, and remain relatively quiet about suggested improvements to each release, working in relatively secrecy from its player base.

&quot;Ancient Domains of Mystery&quot; (1994), or &quot;ADOM&quot; for short, derived from concepts presented in &quot;NetHack&quot;. &quot;ADOM&quot; was originally developed by Thomas Biskup while a student at Technical University of Dortmund. After playing through &quot;Rogue&quot; and &quot;Hack&quot;, he came to &quot;NetHack&quot; and was inspired by the game but dismayed at the complexity and elements he found unnecessary or distracting. Biskup created &quot;ADOM&quot; from scratch with the aim of creating a more story-driven game than &quot;NetHack&quot; that kept the depth of gameplay with a focused theme and setting. The resulting game featured several different dungeons, many generated procedurally, connected through an overworld map of the fictional realm of Ancardia, and would have the player complete various quests in those dungeons to progress the game. A major feature was the influence of Chaos forces through unsealed portals, which the player would have to close. While in areas affected by Chaos, the player&#x27;s character would become tainted, causing mutations that could be either detrimental or beneficial. &quot;ADOM&quot;, like &quot;NetHack&quot; and &quot;Angband&quot;, would gain a devteam to maintain the code and implement updates and patches to avoid excessive forking.

====Other variants====
Not all early roguelikes were readily classified as &quot;Hack&quot; or &quot;Moria&quot; descendants. &quot;Larn&quot; (1986), developed by Noah Morgan, borrowed concepts from both &quot;Hack&quot; (in that there are persistent and fixed levels) and &quot;Moria&quot; (in the availability of a shop level and general difficulty increasing with dungeon level), but while these two games have spiraled in size to take multiple play sessions to complete, &quot;Larn&quot; was aimed to be completed in a single session. &quot;Larn&quot; also uses a fixed-time feature, in that the player had only so many turns to complete a goal, though there were ways to jump back in time as to extend play. &quot;Omega&quot;, developed by Laurence Brothers in the late 1980s, is credited with introducing an overworld concept to the roguelike genre, prior to the feature&#x27;s appearance in &quot;ADOM&quot;. &quot;Omega&quot; was often remembered for its odd inventory approach in which the player would have to pick up an object, considering it being held, and then moving that object to a bag or an equipment slot. &quot;Linley&#x27;s Dungeon Crawl&quot; (1995) was created by Linley Henzell and featured a skill-based character progression system, in which experience points could be used to improve specific skills, such as weapon proficiency or trap detection. One fork of this would form the basis for &quot;Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup&quot; (2006). SSI&#x27;s &quot;Dungeon Hack&quot; (1993) offered randomized dungeons and permadeath within AD&amp;D 2nd Edition rules.

===&quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; games (1993–onward)===
Through 1993, roguelikes primarily existed in computer space, and no home console variants had yet existed. Two of the earliest-known attempts were Sega&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Labyrinth&quot; (1990) and &quot;Dragon Crystal&quot; (1990), but which lacked the depth of a typical computer-based roguelike. Neither proved to be successful games. There was also the 1991 Japanese exclusive Game Boy game &quot;Cave Noire&quot; from Konami, that centred on four distinct roguelike questlines divided into ten difficulty levels.

Chunsoft had gained success by developing the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, a series which established fundamental aspects of the computer role-playing game genre, popular for Western computer audiences, into a more streamlined approach better suited for Japanese players that preferred consoles. With roguelikes starting to gain popularity, Chunsoft&#x27;s developers believed they could do a similar treatment for that genre to make it better suited for Japanese audiences. Chunsoft&#x27;s Koichi Nakamura stated their intent was to take &quot;Rogue&quot; and make it &quot;more understandable, more easy-to-play version&quot; of the title that could be played on consoles. This led to the creation of the &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot;, with the first title being (1993) based on the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series. Several changes to the roguelike formula had to be made for this conversion: they had developed ways to reduce the difficulty of the roguelike by using progressively more difficult dungeons that were randomly generated, and made permadeath an option by selection of difficulty level. An added benefit for &quot;Torneko no Daibōken&quot; was that it used the established &quot;Dragon Quest 4&quot; setting and the character Torneko, helping to make the game familiar to its planned audience and giving a story for the player to follow. While &quot;Torneko no Daibōken&quot; did not sell as well as typical &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, it was successful enough for Chunsoft to develop a second title based on a wholly original character and setting, &quot;Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer&quot;, released in 1995. Chunsoft found that they were more creative with how they developed the game without the need to respect an existing property. Since then, Chunsoft has developed over 25 games in the &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; series for various platforms, In addition to their &quot;Shiren&quot; titles, many of the other Chunsoft &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; games span various franchises, including &quot;Chocobo&quot; series based on &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; based on &quot;Pokémon&quot;, and a crossover with Atlus&#x27; &quot;Etrian Odyssey&quot; in &quot;Etrian Mystery Dungeon&quot;. Several titles in the &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; series were popular, and would become a staple of the Japanese video game market.

A primary difference between the &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; games and Western roguelikes following the Berlin Interpretation is the lack of permadeath – in &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; games, player-characters may die or become too injured, resetting their progress to the start of the dungeon, but the games typically provide means to store and recover equipment and other items from the previous run. The &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; games were not as successful in Western markets when published there, as the target players – younger players who likely had not experienced games like &quot;Rogue&quot; – found the lack of a traditional role-playing game save system odd.

Other Japanese role-playing games would incorporate random dungeon generation as part of their design, mimicking part of the nature of roguelikes, and were considered roguelike titles when published in Western markets. Such titles include &quot;Azure Dreams&quot;, &quot;Dark Cloud&quot;, &quot;Shining Soul&quot;, and &quot;Baroque&quot;. The massively multiplayer online role playing game &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; added a randomly-generated Deep Dungeon that was inspired by the procedural generation of roguelikes.

===Continued development in Western markets (2002–onward)===

Though new classical roguelike variants would continue to be developed within the Western market, the genre languished as more advanced personal computers capable of improved graphics capabilities and games that utilized these features became popular. However, some of these new graphical games drew influence for roguelike concepts, notably action role-playing games like Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Diablo&quot; (1996). &quot;Diablo&quot;″s creator, David Brevik, acknowledged that games like &quot;Rogue&quot;, &quot;NetHack&quot;, &quot;Telengard&quot; and other roguelikes influenced the design of &quot;Diablo&quot;, including the nature of randomly generated dungeons and loot.

Existing roguelikes continue to be developed: a sequel to &quot;ADOM&quot; successfully received crowd funding in 2012, while &quot;NetHack&quot;″s first major release in ten years in 2015 is set to help the DevTeam expand the game further. New roguelikes that adhere to core Berlin Interpretation rules are still being created, including &quot;Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup&quot; (2006), &quot;Dungeons of Dredmor&quot; (2011), and &quot;Dragon Fin Soup&quot; (2015). A subclass of &quot;coffeebreak roguelikes&quot; that could be completed in a short period of time have developed, often derived from entries in the Seven Day Roguelike Challenge; examples include such as &quot;DoomRL&quot; (2013) and &quot;Desktop Dungeons&quot; (2013) Some games would also take advantage of the ease of developing in the tile-based ASCII interfaces common to roguelikes. For example, the highly popular &quot;Dwarf Fortress&quot; (2006) uses the roguelike interface atop a construction and management simulation, and would serve as a major inspiration for &quot;Minecraft&quot;, while &quot;SanctuaryRPG&quot; (2014) is a more traditional turn-based role playing game featuring a scripted story that uses an ASCII interface and roguelike gameplay elements. &quot;UnReal World&quot; (1992), the game that is considered to be the forerunner of the survival game genre, and which frequently uses procedural generation to create the worlds that players must survive in, was developed by Sami Maaranen and was influenced by roguelikes, with its initial interface being similar to that of &quot;NetHack&quot;.

===Growth of the rogue-lite (2005–onward)===
The roguelike genre saw a resurgence in Western markets after 2000 through independent developers who created a new subgenre designated &quot;rogue-lite&quot;, though the games are also sometimes called &quot;roguelike-likes&quot;. Indie developers began to incorporate roguelike elements into genres not normally associated with roguelikes, creating games that would form the basis of this new subgenre. Two of the earliest cited examples of rogue-lites are &quot;Strange Adventures in Infinite Space&quot; (2002) and its sequel &quot;Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space&quot; (2005) by Digital Eel, both space exploration games that included randomly generated planets and encounters, and permadeath. Digital Eel based their work on the space exploration game &quot;Starflight&quot; along with roguelikes like &quot;NetHack&quot; but wanted to provide a shorter experience that would be easier to replay, akin to tabletop beer and pretzels games like &quot;Deathmaze&quot; and &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Cave&quot; that has elements in common with roguelikes.
&quot;Spelunky&quot; (2008), released shortly after the formation of the Berlin Interpretation, is considered to be a major contribution to the growth of indie-developed rogue-lites. &quot;Spelunky&quot; was developed by Derek Yu, who wanted to take the deep gameplay that is offered by roguelikes and combine it with the ease and pick-up-and-play of a platformer. The result was a platform game incorporating the notion of permadeath in which the player takes an explorer character through randomly-generated caves. The intent was to create &quot;deep&quot; gameplay in which the game could be replayed over and over again, with the randomly generated situations driving the need for the player to develop novel, emergent strategies on the fly. Developer Jason Rohrer stated that &quot;Spelunky&quot; &quot;totally revamped my thinking about single-player videogame design&quot;. Edmund McMillen, the developer of &quot;The Binding of Isaac&quot; (2011), and Kenny and Teddy Lee, the co-developers of &quot;Rogue Legacy&quot; (2012), credit Yu&#x27;s approach with &quot;Spelunky&quot; as showing how to distill down the nature of a traditional roguelike to apply it to other gaming genres which they had done for their rogue-lites. Justin Ma and Matthew Davis, the co-developers of &quot;&quot; (2012), credited both &quot;Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space&quot; and &quot;Spelunky&quot; as part of their influence for &quot;FTL&quot;. All of these games earned critical praise, and their success has led to a more modern resurgence in rogue-lites since their release.

The newfound success in rogue-lites is considered part of a larger trend in those that play both board and computer games, looking for &quot;rich play experiences&quot;, as described by &quot;100 Rogues&quot; developer Keith Burgun, that more popular titles may not always offer. David Bamguart of Gaslamp Games stated that there is a thrill of the risk inherent in rogue-lites with random generation and permadeath, helping the player become more invested in the fate of their player character: &quot;The deadly precariousness inherent to the unknown environments of roguelikes gives that investment a great deal of meaning.&quot; Additionally, many of these newer rogue-lites strive to address the apparent high difficulty and ruthlessness that traditional roguelikes were known for, and newer players will be able to find more help through user-generated game guides and walkthroughs made possible through wide Internet accessibility. Fabien Fischer offers that players have taken to independently developed rogue-lites as they have tired from &quot;superficial gameplay, whitewashing spectacle, the content craze, and Skinner Box design&quot; in titles produced by AAA developers and publishers.

McMillen of &quot;The Binding of Isaac&quot; said that including roguelike elements into other game mechanics can be difficult due to the complex interfaces roguelikes tend to have, but eventually &quot;it becomes an increasingly beautiful, deep, and everlasting design that allows you to generate a seemingly dynamic experience for players, so that each time they play your game they&#x27;re getting a totally new adventure&quot;. Procedural-generated world lets developers create many hours worth of game content without spending resources on designing detailed worlds.

Examples of successful games that have integrated roguelike components into other genres include:

* &quot;Dead Cells&quot;, a roguelike incorporated with Metroidvania-style of platform games 
* &quot;Slay the Spire&quot;, bringing roguelike progression to a deck building game 
* &quot;Crypt of the Necrodancer&quot; which uses a rhythm game-style approach in a roguelike dungeon 
* &quot;Enter the Gungeon&quot; which establishes roguelike progression in a shoot &#x27;em up 
* &quot;Vampire Survivors&quot;, a minimalistic roguelike shoot &#x27;em up.

&quot;Hades&quot;, a roguelite action role-playing game, was built to strongly incorporate elements of non-linear narrative into the game, giving the reason for the player to continually delve into replaying the game, and helped to draw in players to the roguelike genre that otherwise had been put off by its high difficulty level before.

==Community==
The roguelike genre has developed with the expansion of both classical roguelikes and rogue-lite titles, a dedicated fan community has come about to not only discuss games within it but to craft their own tales of near-death adventures or amusing stories in roguelikes. Within this community, there is strong interest in developing roguelikes. The 7 Day Roguelike challenge (7DRL) was born out of a USENET newsgroup in 2005 for roguelike developers, informally challenging them to create the core of a novel roguelike within 7 days to be submitted for judging and play by the public. The competition has continued annually each year, since growing from 5–6 entries in 2005 to over 130 in 2014. In the spirit of the 2008 International Roguelike Conference, the &quot;Roguelike Celebration&quot; was held for the first time in September 2016 in San Francisco where several past and present roguelike developers gathered to discuss the history and future direction of the genre. It has since been organized again in 2017, 2018 and 2019 in San Francisco, and as virtual events in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.

<text>In business theory, disruptive innovation is innovation that creates a new market and value network or enters at the bottom of an existing market and eventually displaces established market-leading firms, products, and alliances. The term, &quot;disruptive innovation&quot; was popularized by the American academic Clayton Christensen and his collaborators beginning in 1995, but the concept had been previously described in Richard N. Foster&#x27;s book &quot;Innovation: The Attacker&#x27;s Advantage&quot; and in the paper &quot;Strategic responses to technological threats&quot;, as well as by Joseph Schumpeter in the book &quot;Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy&quot; (as creative destruction).

Not all innovations are disruptive, even if they are revolutionary. For example, the first automobiles in the late 19th century were not a disruptive innovation, because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horse-drawn vehicles. The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lower-priced Ford Model T in 1908. The &quot;mass-produced&quot; automobile was a disruptive innovation, because it changed the transportation market, whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not.

Disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and entrepreneurs in startups, rather than existing market-leading companies. The business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations (which are needed to compete against current competition). Small teams are more likely to create disruptive innovations than large teams. A disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated with it is higher than the other more incremental, architectural or evolutionary forms of innovations, but once it is deployed in the market, it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets.

Beyond business and economics disruptive innovations can also be considered to disrupt complex systems, including economic and business-related aspects. Through identifying and analyzing systems for possible points of intervention, one can then design changes focused on disruptive interventions.

==Usage history==

Christensen&#x27;s Types of Innovation
;Sustaining
:An innovation that does not significantly affect existing markets. It may be either:
;Evolutionary
:An innovation that improves a product in an existing market in ways that customers are expecting (e.g., fuel injection for gasoline engines, which displaced carburetors.)
;Revolutionary (discontinuous but sustaining)
:An innovation that is unexpected, but nevertheless does not affect existing markets (e.g., the first automobiles in the late 19th century, which were expensive luxury items, and as such very few were sold)
;Disruptive
:An innovation that creates a &quot;new&quot; market or enters at the bottom of an existing market by providing a different set of values, which ultimately (and unexpectedly) overtakes incumbents (e.g., the lower-priced, affordable Ford Model T, which displaced horse-drawn carriages)
The term disruptive technologies was coined by Clayton M. Christensen and introduced in his 1995 article &quot;Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave&quot;, which he cowrote with Joseph Bower. The article is aimed at both management executives who make the funding or purchasing decisions in companies, as well as the research community, which is largely responsible for introducing the disruptive vector to the consumer market. He describes the term further in his book &quot;The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;. &quot;Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; explored the case of the disk drive industry (the disk drive and memory industry, with its rapid technological evolution, is to the study of technology what fruit flies are to the study of genetics, as Christensen was told in the 1990s) and the excavating and Earth-moving industry (where hydraulic actuation slowly, yet eventually, displaced cable-actuated machinery). In his sequel with Michael E. Raynor, &quot;The Innovator&#x27;s Solution&quot;, Christensen replaced the term &quot;disruptive technology&quot; with &quot;disruptive innovation&quot; because he recognized that most technologies are not intrinsically disruptive or sustaining in character; rather, it is the &quot;business model&quot; that identifies the crucial idea that potentiates profound market success and subsequently serves as the disruptive vector. Comprehending Christensen&#x27;s business model, which takes the disruptive vector from the idea borne from the mind of the innovator to a marketable product, is central to understanding how novel technology facilitates the rapid destruction of established technologies and markets by the disruptor. Christensen and Mark W. Johnson, who cofounded the management consulting firm Innosight, described the dynamics of &quot;business model innovation&quot; in the 2008 &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; article &quot;Reinventing Your Business Model&quot;. The concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technological change in the study of innovation by economists, and its implementation and execution by its management at a corporate or policy level.

According to Christensen, &quot;the term &#x27;disruptive innovation&#x27; is misleading when it is used to refer to the derivative, or &#x27;instantaneous value&#x27;, of the market behavior of the product or service, rather than the integral, or &#x27;sum over histories&#x27;, of the product&#x27;s market behavior.&quot;

In the late 1990s, the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of &quot;constructive disruptive technology&quot; by working with the consultant David E. O&#x27;Ryan, whereby the use of current off-the-shelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called &quot;an unfair advantage&quot;. The process or technology change as a whole had to be &quot;constructive&quot; in improving the current method of manufacturing, yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model, resulting in a significant reduction of waste, energy, materials, labor, or legacy costs to the user.

In keeping with the insight that a persuasive advertising campaign can be just as effective as technological sophistication at bringing a successful product to market, Christensen&#x27;s theory explains why many disruptive innovations are not advanced or useful technologies, rather combinations of existing off-the-shelf components, applied shrewdly to a fledgling value network.

Online news site TechRepublic proposes an end using the term, and similar related terms, suggesting that, as of 2014, it is overused jargon.

=== Definition ===

* Disruption is a process, not a product or service, that occurs from the nascent to the mainstream 
* Originates in low-end (less demanding customers) or new market (where none existed) footholds
* New firms don&#x27;t catch on with mainstream customers until quality catches up with their standards
* Success is not a requirement and some business can be disruptive but fail
* New firm&#x27;s business model differs significantly from incumbent

Christensen continues to develop and refine the theory and has accepted that not all examples of disruptive innovation perfectly fit into his theory. For example, he conceded that originating in the low end of the market is not always a cause of disruptive innovation, but rather it fosters competitive business models, using Uber as an example. In an interview with &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine he stated:&quot;Uber helped me realize that it isn’t that being at the bottom of the market is the causal mechanism, but that it’s correlated with a business model that is unattractive to its competitor&quot;.

Entrepreneur Chris Dixon cited the theory for the idea that &quot;the next big thing always starts out being dismissed as a &#x27;toy&#x27;.&quot;

==Theory==
The current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default, an idea that Clayton M. Christensen called the &quot;technology mudslide hypothesis&quot;. This is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesn&#x27;t &quot;keep up technologically&quot; with other firms. In this hypothesis, firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing, where it takes constant upward-climbing effort just to stay still, and any break from the effort (such as complacency born of profitability) causes a rapid downhill slide. Christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong; it doesn&#x27;t model reality. What they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations, but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations (which are needed to compete against current competition). In Christensen&#x27;s terms, a firm&#x27;s existing &quot;value networks&quot; place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm. Meanwhile, start-up firms inhabit different value networks, at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network. At that time, the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the market share attack with a me-too entry, for which survival (not thriving) is the only reward.

In the technology mudslide hypothesis, Christensen differentiated disruptive innovation from sustaining innovation. He explained that the latter&#x27;s goal is to improve existing product performance. On the other hand, he defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers.
Christensen also noted that products considered as disruptive innovations tend to skip stages in the traditional product design and development process to quickly gain market traction and competitive advantage. He argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful, well-managed companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development. These companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations, because the markets have very tight profit margins and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established (sizable) firm. Thus, disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common business-world advice to &quot;focus on the customer&quot; (or &quot;stay close to the customer&quot;, or &quot;listen to the customer&quot;) can be strategically counterproductive.

While Christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful, well-managed companies, O&#x27;Ryan countered that &quot;constructive&quot; integration of existing, new, and forward-thinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same well-managed companies, once decision-making management understood the systemic benefits as a whole.
Christensen distinguishes between &quot;low-end disruption&quot;, which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market, and &quot;new-market disruption&quot;, which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents.

=== Low-end disruption ===
&quot;Low-end disruption&quot; occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance. Therefore, at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments. At this point, a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments, thereby gaining a foothold in the market.

In low-end disruption, the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer, who is happy with a good enough product. This type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality. Once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment, it seeks to improve its profit margin. To get higher profit margins, the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality. To ensure this quality in its product, the disruptor needs to innovate. The incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a not-so-profitable segment, and will move up-market and focus on its more attractive customers. After a number of such encounters, the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving. And then, finally, the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market.

=== New market disruption ===
&quot;New market disruption&quot; occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry. Some scholars note that the creation of a new market is a defining feature of disruptive innovation, particularly in the way it tend to improve products or services differently in comparison to normal market drivers. It initially caters to a niche market and proceeds on defining the industry over time once it is able to penetrate the market or induce consumers to defect from the existing market into the new market it created.
=== Critics ===
The extrapolation of the theory to all aspects of life has been challenged, as has the methodology of relying on selected case studies as the principal form of evidence. Jill Lepore points out that some companies identified by the theory as victims of disruption a decade or more ago, rather than being defunct, remain dominant in their industries today (including Seagate Technology, U.S. Steel, and Bucyrus). Lepore questions whether the theory has been oversold and misapplied, as if it were able to explain everything in every sphere of life, including not just business but education and public institutions. W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, the authors of &quot;Blue Ocean Strategy&quot;, also published a book in 2023, &quot;Beyond Disruption&quot;, criticizing disruptive innovation for the social costs it tends to incur.

==Disruptive technology==
In 2009, Milan Zeleny described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted. The answer, according to Zeleny, is the &quot;support network&quot; of high technology. For example, introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars (network of gas and service stations). Such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners. In the long run, high (disruptive) technology bypasses, upgrades, or replaces the outdated support network.

Questioning the concept of a disruptive technology, Haxell (2012) questions how such technologies get named and framed, pointing out that this is a positioned and retrospective act.

Technology, being a form of social relationship, always evolves. No technology remains fixed. Technology starts, develops, persists, mutates, stagnates, and declines, just like living organisms. The evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology. A new high-technology core emerges and challenges existing technology support nets (TSNs), which are thus forced to coevolve with it. New versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate TSN, with smaller and smaller high-technology effects. High technology becomes regular technology, with more efficient versions fitting the same support net. Finally, even the efficiency gains diminish, emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes (appearance, style), and technology becomes TSN-preserving appropriate technology. This technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated, resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation; then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated.

Regarding this evolving process of technology, Christensen said:
The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report on &quot;The Changing Nature of Work&quot; examines how technology shapes the relative demand for certain skills in labor markets and expands the reach of firms - robotics and digital technologies, for example, enable firms to automate, replacing labor with machines to become more efficient, and innovate, expanding the number of tasks and products. Joseph Bower explained the process of how disruptive technology, through its requisite support net, dramatically transforms a certain industry.
For example, the automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage. It evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable, unchanging TSN. The main high-technology advance in the offing is some form of electric car—whether the energy source is the sun, hydrogen, water, air pressure, or traditional charging outlet. Electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile. The printing press was a development that changed the way that information was stored, transmitted, and replicated. This allowed empowered authors but it also promoted censorship and information overload in writing technology.

Milan Zeleny described the above phenomenon. He also wrote that:
Social media could be considered a disruptive innovation within sports. More specifically, the way that news in sports circulates nowadays versus the pre-internet era where sports news was mainly on TV, radio and newspapers. Social media has created a new market for sports that was not around before in the sense that players and fans have instant access to information related to sports.

Disruptiveness of research articles can be estimated with CD index.

==High-technology effects==
High technology is a technology core that changes the very architecture (structure and organization) of the components of the technology support net. High technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the TSN&#x27;s tasks and their relations, as well as their requisite physical, energy, and information flows. It also affects the skills required, the roles played, and the styles of management and coordination—the organizational culture itself.

This kind of technology core is different from regular technology core, which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way, but faster, more reliably, in larger quantities, or more efficiently. It is also different from appropriate technology core, which preserves the TSN itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency, instead of improving the efficiency of performance.

On differences between high and low technologies, Milan Zeleny wrote:
Not all modern technologies are high technologies, only those used and functioning as such, and embedded in their requisite TSNs. They have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge. Not all information technologies have integrative effects. Some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing TSN. The administrative model of management, for instance, further aggravates the division of task and labor, further specializes knowledge, separates management from workers, and concentrates information and knowledge in centers.

As knowledge surpasses capital, labor, and raw materials as the dominant economic resource, technologies are also starting to reflect this shift. Technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks. Nowadays knowledge does not reside in a super-mind, super-book, or super-database, but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action.

== Proactive approach ==
A proactive approach to addressing the challenge posed by disruptive innovations has been debated by scholars. Petzold criticized the lack of acknowledgment of underlying process of the change to study the disruptive innovation over time from a process view and complexify the concept to support the understanding of its unfolding and advance its manageability. Keeping in view the multidimensional nature of disruptive innovation a measurement framework has been developed by Guo to enable a systemic assessment of disruptive potential of innovations, providing insights for the decisions in product/service launch and resource allocation. Middle managers play an important role in long term sustainability of any firm and thus have been studied to have a proactive role in exploitation of the disruptive innovation process.

==Examples==
In the practical world, the popularization of personal computers illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation. The original centralized concept (one computer, many persons) is a knowledge-defying idea of the prehistory of computing, and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent. The era of personal computing brought powerful computers &quot;on every desk&quot; (one person, one computer). This short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment, but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge. Adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing (one person, many computers). Each person&#x27;s computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the Internet of other computers, databases, and mainframes, as well as production, distribution, and retailing facilities, and the like. For the first time, technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies. It transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs: at the loci of the useful knowledge. Even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate, free and empowered individuals do; knowledge, innovation, spontaneity, and self-reliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted.

Uber is not an example of disruption because it did not originate in a low-end or new market footholds. One of the conditions for the business to be considered disruptive according to Clayton M. Christensen is that the business should originate on a) low-end or b) new-market footholds. Instead, Uber was launched in San Francisco, a large urban city with an established taxi service and did not target low-end customers or create a new market (from the consumer perspective). In contrast, UberSELECT, an option that provides luxurious cars such as limousines at a discounted price, is an example of disruption innovation because it originates from a low-end customer segment - customers who would not have entered the traditional luxurious market.

<text>Year 212 ([[Roman numerals|CCXII]]) was a leap year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Asper and Camilius (or, less frequently, year 965 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 212 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<doc id="47891" wikidata="Q215909" url="?curid=47891" title="Augur">
<text>An augur was a priest and official in the classical Roman world. His main role was the practice of augury, the interpretation of the will of the gods by studying events he observed within a predetermined sacred space (&quot;templum&quot;). The &quot;templum&quot; corresponded to the heavenly space above. The augur&#x27;s decisions were based on what he personally saw or heard from within the &quot;templum&quot;; they included thunder, lightning and any accidental signs such as falling objects, but in particular, birdsigns; whether the birds he saw flew in groups or alone, what noises they made as they flew, the direction of flight, what kind of birds they were, how many there were, or how they fed. This practice was known as &quot;taking the auspices&quot;. As circumstance did not always favour the convenient appearance of wild birds or weather phenomena, domesticated chickens kept for the purpose were sometimes released into the templum, where their behaviour, particularly how they fed, could be studied by the augur.

The augural ceremony and function of the augur was central to any major undertaking in Roman society – public or private – including matters of war, commerce, and religion. Augurs sought the divine will regarding any proposed course of action which might affect Rome&#x27;s &quot;pax&quot;, &quot;fortuna&quot;, and &quot;salus&quot; (peace, good fortune, and well-being).

==Etymology==

Although ancient authors believed that the term &quot;augur&quot; contained the words &quot;avis&quot; and &quot;gerō&quot; – Latin for &quot;directing the birds&quot;, historical-linguistic evidence points instead to the root &quot;augeō&quot;: &quot;to increase, to prosper&quot;.

==History and public role==

Political, military and civil actions were sanctioned by augury and by haruspices.

Historically, augury was performed by priests of the college of augurs on behalf of senior magistrates. The practice itself likely comes from the neighboring region of Etruria, where augurs were highly respected as officials. Magistrates were empowered to conduct augury as required for the performance of their official duties. Magistracies included senior military and civil ranks, which were therefore religious offices in their own right, and magistrates were directly responsible for the &quot;pax&quot;, &quot;fortuna&quot;, and &quot;salus&quot; of Rome and everything that was Roman.

The presiding magistrate at an augural rite held the &quot;right of augury&quot; (&quot;ius augurii&quot;). The right of &quot;nuntiatio&quot; – announcing the appearance of &quot;auspicia oblativa&quot; (unexpected sign) – was reserved for the officiating augur, which would require the interruption of the proceedings then underway.

===Kingdom of Rome===
The Roman historian Livy stressed the importance of the augurs: &quot;Who does not know that this city was founded only after taking the auspices, that everything in war and in peace, at home and abroad, was done only after taking the auspices?&quot;

In the Regal period, which ended 509 BC, tradition holds that there were three augurs at a time; they numbered nine by the third century BC; Sulla increased their number to fifteen. By the Principate, their numbers swelled even further to an estimated 25 members.

===Roman Republic===
During the Republic, priesthoods were prized as greatly as the consulship, the censorship, and the triumph. Membership gave the lifelong right to participate prominently in processions at &quot;ludi&quot; and in public banquets; augurs proudly displayed the symbol of the office, the &quot;lituus&quot;.

Roman augurs were part of a college (Latin &quot;collegium&quot;) of priests who shared the duties and responsibilities of the position. At the foundation of the Republic in 510 BC, the patricians held sole claim to this office; by 300 BC, the office was open to plebeian occupation as well. Senior members of the &quot;collegium&quot; put forth nominations for any vacancies, and members voted on whom to co-opt.

According to Cicero, the &quot;auctoritas&quot; of &quot;ius augurum&quot; included the right to adjourn and overturn the process of law: Consular election could be – and was – rendered invalid by inaugural error. For Cicero, this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Republic. Cicero himself was co-opted into the college only late in his career.

In the later Republic, augury was supervised by the college of &quot;pontifices&quot;, a priestly-magistral office whose powers were increasingly woven into the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;. The office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; eventually became a &quot;de facto&quot; consular prerogative.

===Roman Empire===
The effectiveness of augury could only be judged retrospectively; the divinely ordained condition of peace (&quot;pax deorum&quot;) was an outcome of successful augury. Those whose actions had led to divine wrath (&quot;ira deorum&quot;) could not have possessed a true right of augury (&quot;ius augurum&quot;). Of all the protagonists in the Civil War, only Octavian could have possessed it, because he alone had restored the &quot;pax deorum&quot; to the Roman people. Lucan, writing during the Principate, described the recent Civil War as &quot;unnatural&quot; – a mirror to supernatural disturbances in the greater cosmos. His imagery is apt to the traditional principles of augury and its broader interpretation by Stoic apologists of the Imperial cult. In the Stoic cosmology the &quot;pax deorum&quot; is the expression of natural order in human affairs.

When his colleague Lepidus died, Augustus assumed his office as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, took priestly control over the State oracles (including the Sibylline books), and used his powers as censor to suppress the circulation of &quot;unapproved&quot; oracles.

Despite their lack of political influence under the Roman Empire, the augurate, as with its fellow &quot;quattuor amplissima collegia&quot;, continued to confer prestige on its members.

==Augurs, &quot;auguria&quot;, and &quot;auspices&quot;==
In ancient Rome the &quot;auguria&quot; (augural rites) were considered to be in equilibrium with the &quot;sacra&quot; (&quot;sacred things&quot; or &quot;rites&quot;) and were not the only way by which the gods made their will known.

The &quot;augures publici&quot; (public augurs) concerned themselves only with matters related to the state. The role of the augur was that of consulting and interpreting the will of gods about some course of action such as accession of kings to the throne, of magistrates and major &quot;sacerdotes&quot; to their functions (inauguration) and all public enterprises. It sufficed to say that the augur or magistrate had heard a clap of thunder to suspend the convocation of the comitia.

Since &quot;auguria publica&quot; and inaugurations of magistrates are strictly connected to political life this brought about the deterioration and abuses that condemned augury to progressive and irreversible debasement, stripping it of all religious value.

===Ancient tradition===
According to Varro, before his time augures had distinguished five kinds of territory: ager Romanus, ager Gabinus, ager peregrinus, ager hosticus, ager incertus. These distinctions clearly point to the times of the prehistory of Latium and testify the archaic quality of the art of augury.

The &quot;jus augurale&quot; (augural law) was rigorously secret, therefore very little about the technical aspects of ceremonies and rituals has been recorded. We have only the names of some &quot;auguria&quot;:
*The &quot;augurium salutis&quot; took place once a year, before the magistrates and the people, in which the gods were asked whether it was auspicious to ask to for the welfare of the Romans,
*The &quot;augurium canarium&quot; required the sacrifice of red dogs and took place after wheat grains had formed and before they were shelled.
*The &quot;vernisera auguria&quot; – we know only the name that implies a ritual related to the harvest.

The terms &quot;augurium&quot; and &quot;auspicium&quot; are used indifferently by ancient authors. Modern scholars have debated the issue at length but have failed to find a distinctive definition that may hold for all the known cases. By such considerations Dumezil thinks that the two terms refer in fact to two aspects of the same religious act:
*&quot;auspicium&quot; would design the technical process of the operation, i.e. &quot;aves spicere&quot;, looking at the birds; 
*&quot;augurium&quot; would be the resulting interpretation i.e. the determination, acknowledgement of the presence of the &quot;*auges&quot;, the action favoured by the god(s), the intention and the final product of the whole operation.
In Varro&#x27;s words &quot;Agere augurium, aves specit&quot;&quot;, &quot;to conduct the &quot;augurium&quot;, he observed the birds&quot;.

===Categories===
The auspicia were divided into two categories: requested by man (&quot;impetrativa&quot;) and offered spontaneously by the gods (&quot;oblativa&quot;). Both &quot;impetrativa&quot; and &quot;oblativa&quot; auspices could be further divided into five subclasses:
*ex caelo (thunder, lightning)
*ex avibus (birds)
*ex tripudiis (attitude to food, and feeding manner of Mars&#x27; sacred chickens)
*ex quadrupedibus (dog, horse, wolf, and fox)
*ex diris (ominous events).

Only some species of birds (&quot;aves augurales&quot;) could yield valid signs whose meaning would vary according to the species. Among them were ravens, woodpeckers, owls, ossifragae, and eagles.

Signs from birds were divided into &quot;alites&quot;, from the flight, and &quot;oscines&quot;, from the voice: The &quot;alites&quot; included region of the sky, height and type of flight, behaviour of the bird and place where it would come to rest. The &quot;oscines&quot; included the pitch and direction of the sound.

===Ritual===
Magistrates endowed by the law with the right of &quot;spectio&quot; (observation of auspices) would establish the requested &quot;auspicium&quot; (observation platform) before taking the &quot;auspicia impetrativa&quot; (&quot;requested&quot; or &quot;sought&quot; auspices; see above). The &quot;templum&quot;, or sacred space within which the operation would take place had to be established and delimited (it should be square and have only one entrance) and purified (&quot;effari&quot;, &quot;liberare&quot;).

The enunciation of the requested auspicia that began the observation portion of the ceremony was called &quot;legum dictio&quot;. Observation conditions were rigorous and required absolute silence for validity of the operation. Technically the sky was divided into four sections or regions: &quot;dextera&quot;, &quot;sinistra&quot;, &quot;antica&quot;, and &quot;postica&quot; (right, left, anterior and posterior).

The prototype of the ritual of inauguration of people is described in Livy&#x27;s description of the inauguration of king Numa Pompilius:The augur asks Jupiter: &quot;Si fas est&quot; (i.e. if it is divine justice to do this) &quot;... send me a certain &quot;signum&quot; (sign)&quot; then the augur listed the &quot;auspicia&quot; he wanted to see. When they appeared Numa was declared king.

===Precedence===
Since the observation was complex, conflict among signs was common. A hierarchy among signs was devised: e.g. a sign from the eagle would prevail on that from the woodpecker and the ossifragae (parra).

During the last centuries of the republic the auspices &quot;ex caelo&quot; and &quot;ex tripudiis&quot; supplanted other types, as the other forms could be easily used in a fraudulent way, i.e. bent to suit the desire of the asking person.
Cicero condemned the fraudulent use and denounced the decline in the level of knowledge of the doctrine by the augurs of his time, but in fact the abuse developed from the evasion of negative signs, described in the next subsection.

===Evasion===
The interpretation of signs was vast and complex, and magistrates devised protective tricks to avoid being paralysed by negative signs. Against the negative &quot;auspicia oblativa&quot; the admitted procedures included:
* actively avoiding seeing them
* &quot;repudiare&quot; – refuse them through an interpretative sleight of hand
* &quot;non observare&quot; – by assuming one had not paid attention to them
* declaring something that in fact had not appeared
* &quot;tempestas&quot; – choosing the time of the observation at one&#x27;s will
* &quot;renuntiatio&quot; – making a distinction between observation and formulation
* &quot;vitia&quot; – resorting to acknowledging the presence of mistakes
* repeating the whole procedure.

==Attus Navius==
Contrary to other divinatory practices present in Rome (e.g. haruspicina, consultation of the libri Sibyllini) Roman augury appears to be and pre-historical, originally Latin or Italic, and attested in the Iguvine Tables (&quot;avif aseria&quot;) and among other Latin tribes.

The very story or legend of the foundation of Rome is based on augury. the ascertaining of the will of gods through observation of the sky and of birds. Romulus and Remus indeed acted as augurs and Romulus was considered a great augur throughout the course of his life.

The character that best represented and portrayed the art however was Attus Navius. His story is related by Cicero:
He was born into a very poor family. One day he lost one of his pigs. He then promised the gods that if he found it, he would offer them the biggest grapes growing in his vineyard. After recovering his pig he stood right at the middle of his grape yard facing South. He divided the sky into four sections and observed birds: when they appeared he walked in that direction and found an extraordinary large grape that he offered to the gods.

His story was immediately famous and he became the augur of the king (see above the episode with king Tarquinius narrated by Livy). Henceforth he was considered the patron of the augurs.

<text>The Bay of Bengal is the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean. Geographically it is positioned between the Indian subcontinent and the Indochinese peninsula, located below the Bengal region.

Many South Asian and Southeast Asian countries are dependent on the Bay of Bengal. Geopolitically, the bay is bounded on the west and northwest by India, on the north by Bangladesh, and on the east by Myanmar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India. Its southern limit is a line between Sangaman Kanda, Sri Lanka, and the northwesternmost point of Sumatra, Indonesia. Cox&#x27;s Bazar, the longest sea beach in the world and Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest and the natural habitat of the Bengal tiger, are located along the bay.

The Bay of Bengal occupies an area of . A number of large rivers flow into the Bay of Bengal: the Ganges–Hooghly, the Padma, the Brahmaputra–Jamuna, the Barak–Surma–Meghna, the Irrawaddy, the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Brahmani, the Baitarani, the Krishna, and the Kaveri.

== Background ==
=== Extent ===

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Bay of Bengal as follows:

::&quot;On the east:&quot; A line running from Cape Negrais (16°03&#x27;N) in Burma through the larger islands of the Andaman group, in such a way that all the narrow waters between the islands lie Eastward of the line and are excluded from the Bay of Bengal, as far as a point in Little Andaman Island in latitude 10°48&#x27;N, longitude 92°24&#x27;E and thence along the Southwest limit of the Burma Sea [A line running from &quot;Oedjong Raja&quot; [&quot;&quot;Ujung Raja&quot; or &quot;Point Raja&quot;&quot;] () in Sumatra to Poeloe Bras (Breuëh) and on through the Western Islands of the Nicobar Group to Sandy Point in Little Andaman Island, in such a way that all the narrow waters appertain to the Burma Sea].

::&quot;On the south:&quot; Adam&#x27;s Bridge (between India and Ceylon) and from the Southern extreme of Dondra Head (South point of Ceylon) to the North point of Poeloe Bras ().

Note: Oedjong means &quot;cape&quot; in Dutch language on maps of the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia).

=== Etymology ===
The bay gets its name from the historical Bengal region (modern-day Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and the Barak valley of Southern Assam). In Ancient Indian scriptures, this water body may have been referred to as Mahodadhi (Sanskrit: महोदधि, ). Ancient Romans called it &quot;Sinus Gangeticus&quot; or &quot;Gangeticus Sinus&quot; whilst Ancient Greeks called it in , meaning &quot;Gulf of the Ganges&quot;, and old European maps continued to use this name.

The other Sanskrit names for Bay of Bengal are &quot;Vaṅgopasāgara&quot; (Sanskrit: वङ्गोपसागर, ), &quot;Vaṅgasāgara&quot; (Sanskrit: वङ्गसागर, ), &quot;Pūrvapayodhi&quot; (Sanskrit: पूर्वपयोधि, ).

=== History ===
In ancient Classical India, the Bay of Bengal was most commonly known as Kalinga Sagar (Kalinga Sea). Another name commonly used mainly in Tamil was Vanga Kadal.

Northern Circars occupied the western coast of the Bay of Bengal and is now considered to be India&#x27;s Odisha and Andhra Pradesh state. Chola dynasty (9th century to 12th century) when ruled by Rajaraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I occupied and controlled the Bay of Bengal with Chola Navy circa AD 1014, the Bay of Bengal was also called the Chola Sea or Chola Lake.

The Kakatiya dynasty reached the western coastline of the Bay of Bengal between the Godavari and the Krishna rivers. Kushanas about the middle of the 1st century AD invaded northern India perhaps extending as far as the Bay of Bengal. Chandragupta Maurya extended the Maurya Dynasty across northern India to the Bay of Bengal. Hajipur was a stronghold for Portuguese Pirates. In the 16th century, the Portuguese built trading posts in the north of the Bay of Bengal at Chittagong (Porto Grande) and Satgaon (Porto Pequeno).

The earliest sign of Muslims in the region came from the textile trade routes where one targeted the east Arabian Sea influencing migration of Arabs and Persians and another to the west causing Buddhist Bengalis to culturally mix with Islam.

==== Marine archaeology ====
Maritime archaeology or marine archaeology is the study of how ancient peoples interacted with the sea and waterways. A specialized branch, archaeology of shipwrecks, studies the salvaged artifacts of ancient ships. Stone anchors, amphorae shards, elephant tusks, hippopotamus teeth, ceramic pottery, a rare wood mast and lead ingots are examples which may survive submerged for centuries for archaeologists to discover, study, and place their salvaged findings into the timeline of history. Coral reefs, tsunamis, cyclones, mangrove swamps, battles, and a criss-cross of sea routes in a high trading area combined with piracy have all contributed to shipwrecks in the Bay of Bengal.

==== Shipwrecks and important shipping incidences ====

== Significance ==
=== Economic importance ===

One of the first trading ventures along the Bay of Bengal was The Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies, more commonly referred to as the British East India Company. Gopalpur-on-Sea was one of their main trading centers. Other trading companies along the Bay of Bengal shorelines were the English East India Company and the French East India Company.

BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) supports free trade internationally around the Bay of Bengal between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.

The Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project is a new venture proposed which would create a channel for a shipping route to link the Gulf of Mannar with the Bay of Bengal. This would connect India from east to west without the necessity of going around Sri Lanka.

Thoni and catamaran fishing boats of fishing villages thrive along the Bay of Bengal shorelines. Fishermen can catch between 26 and 44 species of marine fish. In one year, the average catch is two million tons of fish from the Bay of Bengal alone. Approximately 31% of the world&#x27;s coastal fishermen live and work on the bay.

=== Geostrategic importance ===

The Bay of Bengal is centrally located in South and Southeast Asia. It lies at the center of two huge economic blocks, the SAARC and ASEAN. It influences China&#x27;s southern landlocked region in the north and major sea ports of Bangladesh and India. China, India, and Bangladesh have forged naval cooperation agreements with Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia to increase cooperation in checking terrorism in the high seas. The Bay of Bengal&#x27;s connection of South Asia to East Asia has aided in Bangladesh&#x27;s efficiency of distributing natural gas to the Asia Pacific.
Its outlying islands (the Andaman and Nicobar Islands) and, most importantly, major ports such as Chittagong, Mongla, Payra, Paradip, Kolkata, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, and Tuticorin, along its coast with the Bay of Bengal added to its importance.

China has recently made efforts to project influence into the region through tie-ups with Myanmar and Bangladesh. The United States has held major exercises with Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and recently India. The largest ever wargame in Bay of Bengal, known as Malabar 2007, was held in 2007 and naval warships from the United States, India, Singapore, Japan and Australia took part.

Large deposits of natural gas in the areas within Bangladesh&#x27;s sea zone incited a serious urgency by India and Myanmar into a territorial dispute. Disputes over rights of some oil and gas blocks have caused brief diplomatic spats between Myanmar and India with Bangladesh.

The disputed maritime boundary between Bangladesh and Myanmar resulted in military tensions in 2008 and 2009. The maritime dispute between Bangladesh and Myanmar settled in 2012 through the judgement of ITLOS. In 2014, the dispute between India and Bangladesh was also settled in which the UN tribunal awarded Bangladesh 19,467 km2 of the 25,602 km2 sea area of the Bay of Bengal.

=== Religious importance ===
The Bay of Bengal in the stretch of Swargadwar, the gateway to heaven in Sanskrit, in the Indian town of Puri is considered holy by Hindus.
The Samudra arati is a daily tradition started by the present Shankaracharya of Puri 9 years ago to honour the sacred sea. The daily practise includes prayer and fire offering to the sea at Swargadwar in Puri by disciples of the Govardhana matha of the Shankaracharya. On Paush Purnima of every year the Shankaracharya himself comes out to offer prayers to the sea.

== Key features ==
=== Beaches ===

=== Islands ===

The islands in the bay are numerous, including the Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands of India. The Cheduba group of islands, in the north-east, off the Burmese coast, are remarkable for a chain of mud volcanoes, which are occasionally active.

Great Andaman is the main archipelago or island group of the Andaman Islands, whereas Ritchie&#x27;s Archipelago consists of smaller islands. Only 37, or 6.5%, of the 572 islands and islets of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are inhabited.

=== Rivers ===
Many major rivers of India and Bangladesh flow west to east before draining into the Bay of Bengal. The Ganga is the northernmost of these rivers. Its main channel enters and flows through Bangladesh, where it is known as the Padma River, before joining the Meghna River. However, the Brahmaputra River flows from east to west in Assam before turning south and entering Bangladesh where it is called the Jamuna River. This joins the Padma where upon the Padma joins the Meghna River that finally drains into Bay of Bengal. The Sundarbans is a mangrove forest in the southern part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta which lies in the Indian state of West Bengal and in Bangladesh. The Brahmaputra at is the 15th longest River in the world. It originates in Tibet. The Hooghly River, another channel of the Ganga that flows through Kolkata drains into Bay of Bengal at Sagar in West Bengal, India.

The Ganga–Brahmaputra-Barak rivers deposit nearly 1000 million tons of sediment every year. The sediment from these three rivers form the Bengal Delta and the submarine fan, a vast structure that extends from Bengal to south of the Equator, is up to thick, and contains at least 1,130 trillion tonnes of sediment, which has accumulated over the last 17 million years at an average rate of 665 million tons per annum. The fan has buried organic carbon at a rate of nearly 1.1 trillion mol/yr (13.2 million t/yr) since the early Miocene period. The three rivers currently contribute nearly 8% of the total organic carbon (TOC) deposited in the world&#x27;s oceans. Due to high TOC accumulation in the deep sea bed of the Bay of Bengal, the area is rich in oil and natural gas and gas hydrate reserves. Bangladesh can reclaim land substantially and economically gain from the sea area by constructing sea dikes, bunds, causeways and by trapping the sediment from its rivers.

Further southwest of Bengal, the Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri Rivers also flow from west to east across Deccan Plateau in Peninsular India and drain into the Bay of Bengal forming deltas. Many small rivers also drain directly into the Bay of Bengal forming estuaries; the shortest of them is the Cooum River at .

While Myanmar&#x27;s Irrawaddy River flows into the Andaman Sea, sediment from the river is found in the eastern Bay of Bengal.

=== Seaports ===

Indian ports on the bay include Paradip Port, Kolkata Port, Haldia Port, Chennai Port, Visakhapatnam Port, Kakinada Port, Pondicherry Port, Dhamra Port, and Gopalpur-on-Sea. Bangladeshi ports on the Bay are Chittagong, Mongla, Payra Port. Sri Lankan ports include Jaffna, Kankesanthurai, Batticaloa, and Trincomalee. Myanmar&#x27;s main sea port includes Akyab (Sittwe).

== Oceanography ==

&quot;In alphabetical order&quot;

=== Geology ===
==== Lithosphere and plate tectonics ====
The lithosphere of the earth is broken up into what are called tectonic plates. Underneath the Bay of Bengal, which is part of the great Indo-Australian Plate and is slowly moving north east. This plate meets the Burma Microplate at the Sunda Trench. The Nicobar Islands and the Andaman Islands are part of the Burma Microplate. The India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate at the Sunda Trench or Java Trench. Here, the pressure of the two plates on each other increase pressure and temperature resulting in the formation of volcanoes such as the volcanoes in Myanmar, and a volcanic arc called the Sunda Arc. The Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and Asian tsunami was a result of the pressure at this zone causing a submarine earthquake which then resulted in a destructive tsunami.

==== Marine geology ====
A zone 50 m wide extending from the island of Sri Lanka and the Coromandel coast to the head of the bay, and thence southwards through a strip embracing the Andaman and Nicobar islands, is bounded by the 100 fathom line of sea bottom; some 50 m. beyond this lies the 500-fathom limit. Opposite the mouth of the Ganges, however, the intervals between these depths are very much extended by deltaic influence.

Swatch of No Ground is a 14 km-wide deep sea canyon of the Bay of Bengal. The deepest recorded area of this valley is about 1340 m. The submarine canyon is part of the Bengal Fan, the largest submarine fan in the world.

==== Submarine fans ====
Submarine fan is also known as abyssal fan. Bay of Bengal fan, known as Bengal Fan, also known as the Ganges Fan is world&#x27;s largest abyssal fan, also known as deep-sea fans, underwater deltas, and submarine fans. The fan is about long, wide with a maximum thickness of . The fan resulted from the uplift and erosion of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau produced by the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Most of the sediment is supplied by the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers which supply the Lower Meghna delta in Bangladesh and the Hoogly delta in West Bengal (India). Several other large rivers in Bangladesh and India provide smaller contributions. Turbidity currents have transported the sediment through a series of submarine canyons, some of which are more than in length, to be deposited in the Bay of Bengal up to 30 degrees latitude from where it began. To date, the oldest sediments recovered from the Bengal fan are from Early Miocene age. Their mineralogical and geochemical characteristics allow to identify their Himalayan origin and demonstrate that the Himalaya was already a major mountain range 20 million years ago.

The fan completely covers the floor of the Bay of Bengal. It is bordered to the west by the continental slope of eastern India, to the north by the continental slope of Bangladesh and to east by the northern part of Sunda Trench off Myanmar and the Andaman Islands, the accretionary wedge associated with subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath the Sunda Plate and continues along the west side of the Ninety East Ridge. The Nicobar Fan, another lobe of the fan, lies east of the Ninety East Ridge.

The fan is now being explored as a possible source of fossil fuels for the surrounding developing nations.

The fan was first identified by bathymetric survey in the sixties by Bruce C. Heezen and Marie Tharp which identified the abyssal cone and canyon structures. It was delineated and named by Joseph Curray and David Moore following a geological and geophysical survey in 1968.

=== Oceanographic chemistry ===

Coastal regions bordering the Bay of Bengal are rich in minerals. Sri Lanka, Serendib, or &quot;Ratna – Dweepa&quot; which means Gem Island. Amethyst, beryl, ruby, sapphire, topaz, and garnet are just some of the gems of Sri Lanka. Garnet and other precious gems are also found in abundance in the Indian states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. A 2014 study found that as a result of ocean acidification, there was reduced shell thickness of marine animals and breaking strength compared to normal shells. The study also showed that the pH in Bay of Bengal fell to 7.75 compared in 1994 when it averaged 7.95.

=== Oceanographic climate ===

From January to October, the current is northward flowing, and the clockwise circulation pattern is called the &quot;East Indian Current&quot;. The Bay of Bengal monsoon moves in a northwest direction striking the Nicobar Islands, and the Andaman Islands first end of May, then coast of Mainland India by end of June.

The remainder of the year, the counterclockwise current is southwestward flowing, and the circulation pattern is called the East Indian Winter Jet. September and December see very active weather, season varsha (or monsoon), in the Bay of Bengal producing severe cyclones which affect eastern India. Several efforts have been initiated to cope with storm surge.

=== Marine biology, flora and fauna ===

The Bay of Bengal is full of biological diversity, diverging amongst coral reefs, estuaries, fish spawning and nursery areas, and mangroves. The Bay of Bengal is one of the World&#x27;s 64 largest marine ecosystems.

&quot;Kerilia jerdonii&quot; is a sea snake of the Bay of Bengal. Glory of Bengal cone (&quot;Conus bengalensis&quot;) is just one of the seashells which can be photographed along beaches of the Bay of Bengal. An endangered species, the olive ridley sea turtle can survive because of the nesting grounds made available at the Gahirmatha Marine Wildlife Sanctuary, Gahirmatha Beach, Odisha, India. Marlin, barracuda, skipjack tuna, (&quot;Katsuwonus pelamis&quot;), yellowfin tuna, Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin (&quot;Sousa chinensis&quot;), and Bryde&#x27;s whale (&quot;Balaenoptera edeni&quot;) are a few of the marine animals. Bay of Bengal hogfish (&quot;Bodianus neilli&quot;) is a type of wrasse which live in turbid lagoon reefs or shallow coastal reefs. Schools of dolphins can be seen, whether they are the bottle nose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;), pantropical spotted dolphin (&quot;Stenella attenuata&quot;) or the spinner dolphin (&quot;Stenella longirostris&quot;). Tuna and dolphins usually reside in the same waters. In shallower and warmer coastal waters the Irrawaddy dolphins (&quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot;) can be found.

The Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve provides sanctuary to many animals some of which include the saltwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;), giant leatherback sea turtle (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;), and Malayan box turtle (&quot;Cuora amboinensis kamaroma&quot;) to name a few.

Another endangered species royal Bengal tiger is supported by Sundarbans a large estuarine delta that holds a mangrove area in the Ganges River Delta.

== Transboundary issues ==
A transboundary issue is defined as an environmental problem in which either the cause of the problem and/or its impact is separated by a national boundary; or the problem contributes to a global environmental problem and finding regional solutions is considered to be a global environmental benefit. The eight Bay of Bengal countries have (2012) identified three major transboundary problems (or areas of concern) affecting the health of the Bay, that they can work on together. With the support of the Bay Of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem Project (BOBLME), the eight countries are now (2012) developing responses to these issues and their causes, for future implementation as the Strategic Action Programme.

=== Ecological degradation ===
==== Fisheries overexploitation ====

Fisheries production in the Bay of Bengal is six million tonnes per year, more than seven percent of the world&#x27;s catch. The major transboundary issues relating to shared fisheries are: a decline in the overall availability of fish resources; changes in species composition of catches; the high proportion of juvenile fish in the catch; and changes in marine biodiversity, especially through loss of vulnerable and endangered species. The transboundary nature of these issues are: that many fish stocks are shared between BOBLME countries through the transboundary migration of fish, or larvae. Fishing overlaps national jurisdictions, both legally and illegally – overcapacity and overfishing in one location forces a migration of fishers and vessels to other locations. All countries (to a greater or lesser degree) are experiencing difficulties in implementing fisheries management, especially the ecosystem approach to fisheries. Bay of Bengal countries contribute significantly to the global problem of loss of vulnerable and endangered species.
The main causes of the issues are: open access to fishing grounds; government emphasis on increasing fish catches; inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers; increasing fishing effort, especially from trawlers and purse seiners; high consumer demand for fish, including for seed and fishmeal for aquaculture; ineffective fisheries management; and illegal and destructive fishing.

==== Marine habitats degradation ====
The Bay of Bengal is an area of high biodiversity, with many endangered and vulnerable species. The major transboundary issues relating to habitats are: the loss and degradation of mangrove habitats; degradation of coral reefs; and the loss of, and damage to, seagrasses. The transboundary nature of these major issues are: that all three critical habitats occur in all BOBLME countries. Coastal development for several varying uses of the land and sea are common in all BOBLME countries. Trade in products from all the habitats is transboundary in nature. Climate change impacts are shared by all BOBLME countries.
The main causes of the issues are: food security needs of the coastal poor; lack of coastal development plans; increasing trade in products from coastal habitats; coastal development and industrialization; ineffective marine protected areas and lack of enforcement; upstream development that affects water-flow; intensive upstream agricultural practices; and increasing tourism.

=== Environmental degradation ===
==== Environmental hazards ====
The Asian brown cloud, a layer of air pollution that covers much of South Asia and the Indian Ocean every year between January and March, and possibly also during earlier and later months, hangs over the Bay of Bengal. It is considered to be a combination of vehicle exhaust, smoke from
cooking fires, and industrial discharges. Because of this cloud, satellites attempting to track ocean acidification and other ocean health indicators in the Bay have difficulty obtaining accurate measurements.

==== Pollution and water quality ====
The major transboundary issues relating to pollution and water quality are: sewage-borne pathogens and organic load; solid waste/marine litter; increasing nutrient inputs; oil pollution; persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and persistent toxic substances (PTSs); sedimentation; and heavy metals.
The transboundary nature of these issues are: discharge of untreated/partially treated sewage being a common problem. Sewage and organic discharges from the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River are likely to be transboundary. Plastics and derelict fishing gear can be transported long distances across national boundaries. Around 4 million tonnes of microplastics are estimated to come from India and Bangladesh travelling into Sundurban and subsequently the Bay of Bengal. High nutrient discharges from rivers could intensify largescale hypoxia. Atmospheric transport of nutrients is inherently transboundary. Differences between countries with regard to regulation and enforcement of shipping discharges may drive discharges across boundaries. Tar balls are transported long distances. POPs/PTSs and mercury, including organo-mercury, undergo long-range transport. Sedimentation and most heavy metal contamination tend to be localized and lack a strong transboundary dimension. The main causes of the issues are: increasing coastal population density and urbanization; higher consumption, resulting in more waste generated per person; insufficient funds allocated to waste management; migration of industry into BOBLME countries; and proliferation of small industries. A pertinent issue is the rapid growth of the shrimp culture industry which requires use of antibiotics and chemicals for export-quality food safety but pollutes the Bay of Bengal.

=== Tropical storms and cyclones ===
A tropical storm with rotating winds blowing at speeds of is called a cyclone when they originate over the Bay of Bengal, and called a hurricane in the Atlantic. Between 100,000 and 500,000 residents of Bangladesh were killed because of the 1970 Bhola cyclone.

<text>In probability theory and related fields, a stochastic () or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a family of random variables in a probability space, where the index of the family often has the interpretation of time. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. Examples include the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule. Stochastic processes have applications in many disciplines such as biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, physics, image processing, signal processing, control theory, information theory, computer science, and telecommunications. Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.

Applications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process, used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse, and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time. These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes, and were invented repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries.

The term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process, because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space. The terms &quot;stochastic process&quot; and &quot;random process&quot; are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables. But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line. If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead. The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects.

Based on their mathematical properties, stochastic processes can be grouped into various categories, which include random walks, martingales, Markov processes, Lévy processes, Gaussian processes, random fields, renewal processes, and branching processes. The study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability, calculus, linear algebra, set theory, and topology as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis, measure theory, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis. The theory of stochastic processes is considered to be an important contribution to mathematics and it continues to be an active topic of research for both theoretical reasons and applications.

==Introduction==
A stochastic or random process can be defined as a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.

===Classifications===
A stochastic process can be classified in different ways, for example, by its state space, its index set, or the dependence among the random variables. One common way of classification is by the cardinality of the index set and the state space.

When interpreted as time, if the index set of a stochastic process has a finite or countable number of elements, such as a finite set of numbers, the set of integers, or the natural numbers, then the stochastic process is said to be in discrete time. If the index set is some interval of the real line, then time is said to be continuous. The two types of stochastic processes are respectively referred to as discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic processes. Discrete-time stochastic processes are considered easier to study because continuous-time processes require more advanced mathematical techniques and knowledge, particularly due to the index set being uncountable. If the index set is the integers, or some subset of them, then the stochastic process can also be called a random sequence.

If the state space is the integers or natural numbers, then the stochastic process is called a discrete or integer-valued stochastic process. If the state space is the real line, then the stochastic process is referred to as a real-valued stochastic process or a process with continuous state space. If the state space is formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space, then the stochastic process is called a formula_1-dimensional vector process or formula_1-vector process.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;stochastic&quot; in English was originally used as an adjective with the definition &quot;pertaining to conjecturing&quot;, and stemming from a Greek word meaning &quot;to aim at a mark, guess&quot;, and the Oxford English Dictionary gives the year 1662 as its earliest occurrence. In his work on probability &quot;Ars Conjectandi&quot;, originally published in Latin in 1713, Jakob Bernoulli used the phrase &quot;Ars Conjectandi sive Stochastice&quot;, which has been translated to &quot;the art of conjecturing or stochastics&quot;. This phrase was used, with reference to Bernoulli, by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz who in 1917 wrote in German the word &quot;stochastik&quot; with a sense meaning random. The term &quot;stochastic process&quot; first appeared in English in a 1934 paper by Joseph Doob. For the term and a specific mathematical definition, Doob cited another 1934 paper, where the term &quot;stochastischer Prozeß&quot; was used in German by Aleksandr Khinchin, though the German term had been used earlier, for example, by Andrei Kolmogorov in 1931.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, early occurrences of the word &quot;random&quot; in English with its current meaning, which relates to chance or luck, date back to the 16th century, while earlier recorded usages started in the 14th century as a noun meaning &quot;impetuosity, great speed, force, or violence (in riding, running, striking, etc.)&quot;. The word itself comes from a Middle French word meaning &quot;speed, haste&quot;, and it is probably derived from a French verb meaning &quot;to run&quot; or &quot;to gallop&quot;. The first written appearance of the term &quot;random process&quot; pre-dates &quot;stochastic process&quot;, which the Oxford English Dictionary also gives as a synonym, and was used in an article by Francis Edgeworth published in 1888.

===Terminology===
The definition of a stochastic process varies, but a stochastic process is traditionally defined as a collection of random variables indexed by some set. The terms &quot;random process&quot; and &quot;stochastic process&quot; are considered synonyms and are used interchangeably, without the index set being precisely specified. Both &quot;collection&quot;, or &quot;family&quot; are used while instead of &quot;index set&quot;, sometimes the terms &quot;parameter set&quot; or &quot;parameter space&quot; are used.

The term &quot;random function&quot; is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process, though sometimes it is only used when the stochastic process takes real values. This term is also used when the index sets are mathematical spaces other than the real line, while the terms &quot;stochastic process&quot; and &quot;random process&quot; are usually used when the index set is interpreted as time, and other terms are used such as &quot;random field&quot; when the index set is formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space formula_6 or a manifold.

===Notation===
A stochastic process can be denoted, among other ways, by formula_7, formula_8, formula_9 formula_10 or simply as formula_11. Some authors mistakenly write formula_12 even though it is an abuse of function notation. For example, formula_12 or formula_14 are used to refer to the random variable with the index formula_15, and not the entire stochastic process. If the index set is formula_16, then one can write, for example, formula_17 to denote the stochastic process.

==Examples==

===Bernoulli process===
One of the simplest stochastic processes is the Bernoulli process, which is a sequence of independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables, where each random variable takes either the value one or zero, say one with probability formula_18 and zero with probability formula_19. This process can be linked to an idealisation of repeatedly flipping a coin, where the probability of obtaining a head is taken to be formula_18 and its value is one, while the value of a tail is zero. In other words, a Bernoulli process is a sequence of iid Bernoulli random variables, where each idealised coin flip is an example of a Bernoulli trial.

===Random walk===
Random walks are stochastic processes that are usually defined as sums of iid random variables or random vectors in Euclidean space, so they are processes that change in discrete time. But some also use the term to refer to processes that change in continuous time, particularly the Wiener process used in financial models, which has led to some confusion, resulting in its criticism. There are various other types of random walks, defined so their state spaces can be other mathematical objects, such as lattices and groups, and in general they are highly studied and have many applications in different disciplines.

A classic example of a random walk is known as the &quot;simple random walk&quot;, which is a stochastic process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, formula_18, or decreases by one with probability formula_19, so the index set of this random walk is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers. If formula_23, this random walk is called a symmetric random walk.

===Wiener process===
The Wiener process is a stochastic process with stationary and independent increments that are normally distributed based on the size of the increments. The Wiener process is named after Norbert Wiener, who proved its mathematical existence, but the process is also called the Brownian motion process or just Brownian motion due to its historical connection as a model for Brownian movement in liquids.

Playing a central role in the theory of probability, the Wiener process is often considered the most important and studied stochastic process, with connections to other stochastic processes. Its index set and state space are the non-negative numbers and real numbers, respectively, so it has both continuous index set and states space. But the process can be defined more generally so its state space can be formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space. If the mean of any increment is zero, then the resulting Wiener or Brownian motion process is said to have zero drift. If the mean of the increment for any two points in time is equal to the time difference multiplied by some constant formula_25, which is a real number, then the resulting stochastic process is said to have drift formula_25.

Almost surely, a sample path of a Wiener process is continuous everywhere but nowhere differentiable. It can be considered as a continuous version of the simple random walk. The process arises as the mathematical limit of other stochastic processes such as certain random walks rescaled, which is the subject of Donsker&#x27;s theorem or invariance principle, also known as the functional central limit theorem.

The Wiener process is a member of some important families of stochastic processes, including Markov processes, Lévy processes and Gaussian processes. The process also has many applications and is the main stochastic process used in stochastic calculus. It plays a central role in quantitative finance, where it is used, for example, in the Black–Scholes–Merton model. The process is also used in different fields, including the majority of natural sciences as well as some branches of social sciences, as a mathematical model for various random phenomena.

===Poisson process===
The Poisson process is a stochastic process that has different forms and definitions. It can be defined as a counting process, which is a stochastic process that represents the random number of points or events up to some time. The number of points of the process that are located in the interval from zero to some given time is a Poisson random variable that depends on that time and some parameter. This process has the natural numbers as its state space and the non-negative numbers as its index set. This process is also called the Poisson counting process, since it can be interpreted as an example of a counting process.

If a Poisson process is defined with a single positive constant, then the process is called a homogeneous Poisson process. The homogeneous Poisson process is a member of important classes of stochastic processes such as Markov processes and Lévy processes.

The homogeneous Poisson process can be defined and generalized in different ways. It can be defined such that its index set is the real line, and this stochastic process is also called the stationary Poisson process. If the parameter constant of the Poisson process is replaced with some non-negative integrable function of formula_15, the resulting process is called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the average density of points of the process is no longer constant. Serving as a fundamental process in queueing theory, the Poisson process is an important process for mathematical models, where it finds applications for models of events randomly occurring in certain time windows.

Defined on the real line, the Poisson process can be interpreted as a stochastic process, among other random objects. But then it can be defined on the formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space or other mathematical spaces, where it is often interpreted as a random set or a random counting measure, instead of a stochastic process. In this setting, the Poisson process, also called the Poisson point process, is one of the most important objects in probability theory, both for applications and theoretical reasons. But it has been remarked that the Poisson process does not receive as much attention as it should, partly due to it often being considered just on the real line, and not on other mathematical spaces.

==Definitions==

===Stochastic process===
A stochastic process is defined as a collection of random variables defined on a common probability space formula_29, where formula_30 is a sample space, formula_31 is a formula_32-algebra, and formula_33 is a probability measure; and the random variables, indexed by some set formula_34, all take values in the same mathematical space formula_35, which must be measurable with respect to some formula_32-algebra formula_37.

In other words, for a given probability space formula_29 and a measurable space formula_39, a stochastic process is a collection of formula_35-valued random variables, which can be written as:
formula_41

Historically, in many problems from the natural sciences a point formula_42 had the meaning of time, so formula_12 is a random variable representing a value observed at time formula_15. A stochastic process can also be written as formula_45 to reflect that it is actually a function of two variables, formula_42 and formula_47.

There are other ways to consider a stochastic process, with the above definition being considered the traditional one. For example, a stochastic process can be interpreted or defined as a formula_48-valued random variable, where formula_48 is the space of all the possible functions from the set formula_34 into the space formula_35. However this alternative definition as a &quot;function-valued random variable&quot; in general requires additional regularity assumptions to be well-defined.

===Index set===
The set formula_34 is called the index set or parameter set of the stochastic process. Often this set is some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers or an interval, giving the set formula_34 the interpretation of time. In addition to these sets, the index set formula_34 can be another set with a total order or a more general set, such as the Cartesian plane formula_55 or formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space, where an element formula_42 can represent a point in space. That said, many results and theorems are only possible for stochastic processes with a totally ordered index set.

=== State space ===
The mathematical space formula_35 of a stochastic process is called its &quot;state space&quot;. This mathematical space can be defined using integers, real lines, formula_1-dimensional Euclidean spaces, complex planes, or more abstract mathematical spaces. The state space is defined using elements that reflect the different values that the stochastic process can take.

===Sample function===
A sample function is a single outcome of a stochastic process, so it is formed by taking a single possible value of each random variable of the stochastic process. More precisely, if formula_60 is a stochastic process, then for any point formula_61, the mapping
formula_62
is called a sample function, a realization, or, particularly when formula_34 is interpreted as time, a sample path of the stochastic process formula_60. This means that for a fixed formula_61, there exists a sample function that maps the index set formula_34 to the state space formula_35. Other names for a sample function of a stochastic process include trajectory, path function or path.

===Increment===
An increment of a stochastic process is the difference between two random variables of the same stochastic process. For a stochastic process with an index set that can be interpreted as time, an increment is how much the stochastic process changes over a certain time period. For example, if formula_68 is a stochastic process with state space formula_35 and index set formula_16, then for any two non-negative numbers formula_71 and formula_72 such that formula_73, the difference formula_74 is a formula_35-valued random variable known as an increment. When interested in the increments, often the state space formula_35 is the real line or the natural numbers, but it can be formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space or more abstract spaces such as Banach spaces.

===Further definitions===

====Law====
For a stochastic process formula_78 defined on the probability space formula_29, the law of stochastic process formula_11 is defined as the pushforward measure:
formula_81
where formula_33 is a probability measure, the symbol formula_83 denotes function composition and formula_84 is the pre-image of the measurable function or, equivalently, the formula_48-valued random variable formula_11, where formula_48 is the space of all the possible formula_35-valued functions of formula_42, so the law of a stochastic process is a probability measure.

For a measurable subset formula_90 of formula_48, the pre-image of formula_11 gives
formula_93
so the law of a formula_11 can be written as:
formula_95

The law of a stochastic process or a random variable is also called the probability law, probability distribution, or the distribution.

====Finite-dimensional probability distributions====

For a stochastic process formula_11 with law formula_97, its finite-dimensional distribution for formula_98 is defined as:
formula_99
This measure formula_100 is the joint distribution of the random vector formula_101; it can be viewed as a &quot;projection&quot; of the law formula_97 onto a finite subset of formula_34.

For any measurable subset formula_104 of the formula_1-fold Cartesian power formula_106, the finite-dimensional distributions of a stochastic process formula_11 can be written as:
formula_108
The finite-dimensional distributions of a stochastic process satisfy two mathematical conditions known as consistency conditions.

====Stationarity====

Stationarity is a mathematical property that a stochastic process has when all the random variables of that stochastic process are identically distributed. In other words, if formula_11 is a stationary stochastic process, then for any formula_42 the random variable formula_14 has the same distribution, which means that for any set of formula_1 index set values formula_113, the corresponding formula_1 random variables
formula_115
all have the same probability distribution. The index set of a stationary stochastic process is usually interpreted as time, so it can be the integers or the real line. But the concept of stationarity also exists for point processes and random fields, where the index set is not interpreted as time.

When the index set formula_34 can be interpreted as time, a stochastic process is said to be stationary if its finite-dimensional distributions are invariant under translations of time. This type of stochastic process can be used to describe a physical system that is in steady state, but still experiences random fluctuations. The intuition behind stationarity is that as time passes the distribution of the stationary stochastic process remains the same. A sequence of random variables forms a stationary stochastic process only if the random variables are identically distributed.

A stochastic process with the above definition of stationarity is sometimes said to be strictly stationary, but there are other forms of stationarity. One example is when a discrete-time or continuous-time stochastic process formula_11 is said to be stationary in the wide sense, then the process formula_11 has a finite second moment for all formula_42 and the covariance of the two random variables formula_14 and formula_121 depends only on the number formula_122 for all formula_42. Khinchin introduced the related concept of stationarity in the wide sense, which has other names including covariance stationarity or stationarity in the broad sense.

====Filtration====
A filtration is an increasing sequence of sigma-algebras defined in relation to some probability space and an index set that has some total order relation, such as in the case of the index set being some subset of the real numbers. More formally, if a stochastic process has an index set with a total order, then a filtration formula_124, on a probability space formula_29 is a family of sigma-algebras such that formula_126 for all formula_127, where formula_128 and formula_129 denotes the total order of the index set formula_34. With the concept of a filtration, it is possible to study the amount of information contained in a stochastic process formula_14 at formula_42, which can be interpreted as time formula_15. The intuition behind a filtration formula_134 is that as time formula_15 passes, more and more information on formula_14 is known or available, which is captured in formula_134, resulting in finer and finer partitions of formula_30.

====Modification====
A modification of a stochastic process is another stochastic process, which is closely related to the original stochastic process. More precisely, a stochastic process formula_11 that has the same index set formula_34, state space formula_35, and probability space formula_142 as another stochastic process formula_143 is said to be a modification of formula_11 if for all formula_42 the following
formula_146
holds. Two stochastic processes that are modifications of each other have the same finite-dimensional law and they are said to be stochastically equivalent or equivalent.

Instead of modification, the term version is also used, however some authors use the term version when two stochastic processes have the same finite-dimensional distributions, but they may be defined on different probability spaces, so two processes that are modifications of each other, are also versions of each other, in the latter sense, but not the converse.

If a continuous-time real-valued stochastic process meets certain moment conditions on its increments, then the Kolmogorov continuity theorem says that there exists a modification of this process that has continuous sample paths with probability one, so the stochastic process has a continuous modification or version. The theorem can also be generalized to random fields so the index set is formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space as well as to stochastic processes with metric spaces as their state spaces.

====Indistinguishable====
Two stochastic processes formula_11 and formula_143 defined on the same probability space formula_150 with the same index set formula_34 and set space formula_35 are said be indistinguishable if the following
formula_153
holds. If two formula_11 and formula_143 are modifications of each other and are almost surely continuous, then formula_11 and formula_143 are indistinguishable.

====Separability====
Separability is a property of a stochastic process based on its index set in relation to the probability measure. The property is assumed so that functionals of stochastic processes or random fields with uncountable index sets can form random variables. For a stochastic process to be separable, in addition to other conditions, its index set must be a separable space, which means that the index set has a dense countable subset.

More precisely, a real-valued continuous-time stochastic process formula_11 with a probability space formula_142 is separable if its index set formula_34 has a dense countable subset formula_161 and there is a set formula_162 of probability zero, so formula_163, such that for every open set formula_164 and every closed set formula_165, the two events formula_166 and formula_167 differ from each other at most on a subset of formula_168.
The definition of separability can also be stated for other index sets and state spaces, such as in the case of random fields, where the index set as well as the state space can be formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space.

The concept of separability of a stochastic process was introduced by Joseph Doob. The underlying idea of separability is to make a countable set of points of the index set determine the properties of the stochastic process. Any stochastic process with a countable index set already meets the separability conditions, so discrete-time stochastic processes are always separable. A theorem by Doob, sometimes known as Doob&#x27;s separability theorem, says that any real-valued continuous-time stochastic process has a separable modification. Versions of this theorem also exist for more general stochastic processes with index sets and state spaces other than the real line.

====Independence====
Two stochastic processes formula_11 and formula_143 defined on the same probability space formula_150 with the same index set formula_34 are said be independent if for all formula_174 and for every choice of epochs formula_175, the random vectors formula_176 and formula_177 are independent.

====Uncorrelatedness====
Two stochastic processes formula_178 and formula_179 are called uncorrelated if their cross-covariance formula_180 is zero for all times. Formally:

:formula_181.

====Independence implies uncorrelatedness====
If two stochastic processes formula_11 and formula_143 are independent, then they are also uncorrelated.

====Orthogonality====
Two stochastic processes formula_178 and formula_179 are called orthogonal if their cross-correlation formula_186 is zero for all times. Formally:

:formula_187.

====Skorokhod space====

A Skorokhod space, also written as Skorohod space, is a mathematical space of all the functions that are right-continuous with left limits, defined on some interval of the real line such as formula_188 or formula_189, and take values on the real line or on some metric space. Such functions are known as càdlàg or cadlag functions, based on the acronym of the French phrase &quot;continue à droite, limite à gauche&quot;. A Skorokhod function space, introduced by Anatoliy Skorokhod, is often denoted with the letter formula_190, so the function space is also referred to as space formula_190. The notation of this function space can also include the interval on which all the càdlàg functions are defined, so, for example, formula_192 denotes the space of càdlàg functions defined on the unit interval formula_188.

Skorokhod function spaces are frequently used in the theory of stochastic processes because it often assumed that the sample functions of continuous-time stochastic processes belong to a Skorokhod space. Such spaces contain continuous functions, which correspond to sample functions of the Wiener process. But the space also has functions with discontinuities, which means that the sample functions of stochastic processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the real line), are also members of this space.

====Regularity====
In the context of mathematical construction of stochastic processes, the term regularity is used when discussing and assuming certain conditions for a stochastic process to resolve possible construction issues. For example, to study stochastic processes with uncountable index sets, it is assumed that the stochastic process adheres to some type of regularity condition such as the sample functions being continuous.

==Further examples==

===Markov processes and chains===

Markov processes are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, that have the Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process. In other words, the behavior of the process in the future is stochastically independent of its behavior in the past, given the current state of the process.

The Brownian motion process and the Poisson process (in one dimension) are both examples of Markov processes in continuous time, while random walks on the integers and the gambler&#x27;s ruin problem are examples of Markov processes in discrete time.

A Markov chain is a type of Markov process that has either discrete state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it has been also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space). It has been argued that the first definition of a Markov chain, where it has discrete time, now tends to be used, despite the second definition having been used by researchers like Joseph Doob and Kai Lai Chung.

Markov processes form an important class of stochastic processes and have applications in many areas. For example, they are the basis for a general stochastic simulation method known as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which is used for simulating random objects with specific probability distributions, and has found application in Bayesian statistics.

The concept of the Markov property was originally for stochastic processes in continuous and discrete time, but the property has been adapted for other index sets such as formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space, which results in collections of random variables known as Markov random fields.

===Martingale===

A martingale is a discrete-time or continuous-time stochastic process with the property that, at every instant, given the current value and all the past values of the process, the conditional expectation of every future value is equal to the current value. In discrete time, if this property holds for the next value, then it holds for all future values. The exact mathematical definition of a martingale requires two other conditions coupled with the mathematical concept of a filtration, which is related to the intuition of increasing available information as time passes. Martingales are usually defined to be real-valued, but they can also be complex-valued or even more general.

A symmetric random walk and a Wiener process (with zero drift) are both examples of martingales, respectively, in discrete and continuous time. For a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables formula_195 with zero mean, the stochastic process formed from the successive partial sums formula_196 is a discrete-time martingale. In this aspect, discrete-time martingales generalize the idea of partial sums of independent random variables.

Martingales can also be created from stochastic processes by applying some suitable transformations, which is the case for the homogeneous Poisson process (on the real line) resulting in a martingale called the &quot;compensated Poisson process&quot;. Martingales can also be built from other martingales. For example, there are martingales based on the martingale the Wiener process, forming continuous-time martingales.

Martingales mathematically formalize the idea of a &#x27;fair game&#x27; where it is possible form reasonable expectations for payoffs, and they were originally developed to show that it is not possible to gain an &#x27;unfair&#x27; advantage in such a game. But now they are used in many areas of probability, which is one of the main reasons for studying them. Many problems in probability have been solved by finding a martingale in the problem and studying it. Martingales will converge, given some conditions on their moments, so they are often used to derive convergence results, due largely to martingale convergence theorems.

Martingales have many applications in statistics, but it has been remarked that its use and application are not as widespread as it could be in the field of statistics, particularly statistical inference. They have found applications in areas in probability theory such as queueing theory and Palm calculus and other fields such as economics and finance.

===Lévy process===

Lévy processes are types of stochastic processes that can be considered as generalizations of random walks in continuous time. These processes have many applications in fields such as finance, fluid mechanics, physics and biology. The main defining characteristics of these processes are their stationarity and independence properties, so they were known as &quot;processes with stationary and independent increments&quot;. In other words, a stochastic process formula_11 is a Lévy process if for formula_1 non-negatives numbers, formula_199, the corresponding formula_200 increments
formula_201
are all independent of each other, and the distribution of each increment only depends on the difference in time.

A Lévy process can be defined such that its state space is some abstract mathematical space, such as a Banach space, but the processes are often defined so that they take values in Euclidean space. The index set is the non-negative numbers, so formula_202, which gives the interpretation of time. Important stochastic processes such as the Wiener process, the homogeneous Poisson process (in one dimension), and subordinators are all Lévy processes.

===Random field===

A random field is a collection of random variables indexed by a formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space or some manifold. In general, a random field can be considered an example of a stochastic or random process, where the index set is not necessarily a subset of the real line. But there is a convention that an indexed collection of random variables is called a random field when the index has two or more dimensions. If the specific definition of a stochastic process requires the index set to be a subset of the real line, then the random field can be considered as a generalization of stochastic process.

===Point process===

A point process is a collection of points randomly located on some mathematical space such as the real line, formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space, or more abstract spaces. Sometimes the term &quot;point process&quot; is not preferred, as historically the word &quot;process&quot; denoted an evolution of some system in time, so a point process is also called a random point field. There are different interpretations of a point process, such a random counting measure or a random set. Some authors regard a point process and stochastic process as two different objects such that a point process is a random object that arises from or is associated with a stochastic process, though it has been remarked that the difference between point processes and stochastic processes is not clear.

Other authors consider a point process as a stochastic process, where the process is indexed by sets of the underlying space on which it is defined, such as the real line or formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space. Other stochastic processes such as renewal and counting processes are studied in the theory of point processes.

==History==

===Early probability theory===
Probability theory has its origins in games of chance, which have a long history, with some games being played thousands of years ago, but very little analysis on them was done in terms of probability. The year 1654 is often considered the birth of probability theory when French mathematicians Pierre Fermat and Blaise Pascal had a written correspondence on probability, motivated by a gambling problem. But there was earlier mathematical work done on the probability of gambling games such as &quot;Liber de Ludo Aleae&quot; by Gerolamo Cardano, written in the 16th century but posthumously published later in 1663.

After Cardano, Jakob Bernoulli wrote Ars Conjectandi, which is considered a significant event in the history of probability theory. Bernoulli&#x27;s book was published, also posthumously, in 1713 and inspired many mathematicians to study probability. But despite some renowned mathematicians contributing to probability theory, such as Pierre-Simon Laplace, Abraham de Moivre, Carl Gauss, Siméon Poisson and Pafnuty Chebyshev, most of the mathematical community did not consider probability theory to be part of mathematics until the 20th century.

===Statistical mechanics===
In the physical sciences, scientists developed in the 19th century the discipline of statistical mechanics, where physical systems, such as containers filled with gases, are regarded or treated mathematically as collections of many moving particles. Although there were attempts to incorporate randomness into statistical physics by some scientists, such as Rudolf Clausius, most of the work had little or no randomness.
This changed in 1859 when James Clerk Maxwell contributed significantly to the field, more specifically, to the kinetic theory of gases, by presenting work where he modelled the gas particles as moving in random directions at random velocities. The kinetic theory of gases and statistical physics continued to be developed in the second half of the 19th century, with work done chiefly by Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Gibbs, which would later have an influence on Albert Einstein&#x27;s mathematical model for Brownian movement.

===Measure theory and probability theory===
At the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900, David Hilbert presented a list of mathematical problems, where his sixth problem asked for a mathematical treatment of physics and probability involving axioms. Around the start of the 20th century, mathematicians developed measure theory, a branch of mathematics for studying integrals of mathematical functions, where two of the founders were French mathematicians, Henri Lebesgue and Émile Borel. In 1925, another French mathematician Paul Lévy published the first probability book that used ideas from measure theory.

In the 1920s, fundamental contributions to probability theory were made in the Soviet Union by mathematicians such as Sergei Bernstein, Aleksandr Khinchin, and Andrei Kolmogorov. Kolmogorov published in 1929 his first attempt at presenting a mathematical foundation, based on measure theory, for probability theory. In the early 1930s, Khinchin and Kolmogorov set up probability seminars, which were attended by researchers such as Eugene Slutsky and Nikolai Smirnov, and Khinchin gave the first mathematical definition of a stochastic process as a set of random variables indexed by the real line.

===Birth of modern probability theory===
In 1933, Andrei Kolmogorov published in German, his book on the foundations of probability theory titled &quot;Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung&quot;, where Kolmogorov used measure theory to develop an axiomatic framework for probability theory. The publication of this book is now widely considered to be the birth of modern probability theory, when the theories of probability and stochastic processes became parts of mathematics.

After the publication of Kolmogorov&#x27;s book, further fundamental work on probability theory and stochastic processes was done by Khinchin and Kolmogorov as well as other mathematicians such as Joseph Doob, William Feller, Maurice Fréchet, Paul Lévy, Wolfgang Doeblin, and Harald Cramér.
Decades later, Cramér referred to the 1930s as the &quot;heroic period of mathematical probability theory&quot;. World War II greatly interrupted the development of probability theory, causing, for example, the migration of Feller from Sweden to the United States of America and the death of Doeblin, considered now a pioneer in stochastic processes.

===Stochastic processes after World War II===
After World War II, the study of probability theory and stochastic processes gained more attention from mathematicians, with significant contributions made in many areas of probability and mathematics as well as the creation of new areas. Starting in the 1940s, Kiyosi Itô published papers developing the field of stochastic calculus, which involves stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations based on the Wiener or Brownian motion process.

Also starting in the 1940s, connections were made between stochastic processes, particularly martingales, and the mathematical field of potential theory, with early ideas by Shizuo Kakutani and then later work by Joseph Doob. Further work, considered pioneering, was done by Gilbert Hunt in the 1950s, connecting Markov processes and potential theory, which had a significant effect on the theory of Lévy processes and led to more interest in studying Markov processes with methods developed by Itô.

In 1953, Doob published his book &quot;Stochastic processes&quot;, which had a strong influence on the theory of stochastic processes and stressed the importance of measure theory in probability.
 Doob also chiefly developed the theory of martingales, with later substantial contributions by Paul-André Meyer. Earlier work had been carried out by Sergei Bernstein, Paul Lévy and Jean Ville, the latter adopting the term martingale for the stochastic process. Methods from the theory of martingales became popular for solving various probability problems. Techniques and theory were developed to study Markov processes and then applied to martingales. Conversely, methods from the theory of martingales were established to treat Markov processes.

Other fields of probability were developed and used to study stochastic processes, with one main approach being the theory of large deviations. The theory has many applications in statistical physics, among other fields, and has core ideas going back to at least the 1930s. Later in the 1960s and 1970s, fundamental work was done by Alexander Wentzell in the Soviet Union and Monroe D. Donsker and Srinivasa Varadhan in the United States of America, which would later result in Varadhan winning the 2007 Abel Prize. In the 1990s and 2000s the theories of Schramm–Loewner evolution and rough paths were introduced and developed to study stochastic processes and other mathematical objects in probability theory, which respectively resulted in Fields Medals being awarded to Wendelin Werner in 2008 and to Martin Hairer in 2014.

The theory of stochastic processes still continues to be a focus of research, with yearly international conferences on the topic of stochastic processes.

===Discoveries of specific stochastic processes===
Although Khinchin gave mathematical definitions of stochastic processes in the 1930s, specific stochastic processes had already been discovered in different settings, such as the Brownian motion process and the Poisson process. Some families of stochastic processes such as point processes or renewal processes have long and complex histories, stretching back centuries.

====Bernoulli process====
The Bernoulli process, which can serve as a mathematical model for flipping a biased coin, is possibly the first stochastic process to have been studied. The process is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, which are named after Jacob Bernoulli who used them to study games of chance, including probability problems proposed and studied earlier by Christiaan Huygens. Bernoulli&#x27;s work, including the Bernoulli process, were published in his book &quot;Ars Conjectandi&quot; in 1713.

====Random walks====
In 1905, Karl Pearson coined the term &quot;random walk&quot; while posing a problem describing a random walk on the plane, which was motivated by an application in biology, but such problems involving random walks had already been studied in other fields. Certain gambling problems that were studied centuries earlier can be considered as problems involving random walks. For example, the problem known as the &quot;Gambler&#x27;s ruin&quot; is based on a simple random walk, and is an example of a random walk with absorbing barriers. Pascal, Fermat and Huyens all gave numerical solutions to this problem without detailing their methods, and then more detailed solutions were presented by Jakob Bernoulli and Abraham de Moivre.

For random walks in formula_1-dimensional integer lattices, George Pólya published, in 1919 and 1921, work where he studied the probability of a symmetric random walk returning to a previous position in the lattice. Pólya showed that a symmetric random walk, which has an equal probability to advance in any direction in the lattice, will return to a previous position in the lattice an infinite number of times with probability one in one and two dimensions, but with probability zero in three or higher dimensions.

====Wiener process====
The Wiener process or Brownian motion process has its origins in different fields including statistics, finance and physics. In 1880, Danish astronomer Thorvald Thiele wrote a paper on the method of least squares, where he used the process to study the errors of a model in time-series analysis. The work is now considered as an early discovery of the statistical method known as Kalman filtering, but the work was largely overlooked. It is thought that the ideas in Thiele&#x27;s paper were too advanced to have been understood by the broader mathematical and statistical community at the time.

The French mathematician Louis Bachelier used a Wiener process in his 1900 thesis in order to model price changes on the Paris Bourse, a stock exchange, without knowing the work of Thiele. It has been speculated that Bachelier drew ideas from the random walk model of Jules Regnault, but Bachelier did not cite him, and Bachelier&#x27;s thesis is now considered pioneering in the field of financial mathematics.

It is commonly thought that Bachelier&#x27;s work gained little attention and was forgotten for decades until it was rediscovered in the 1950s by the Leonard Savage, and then become more popular after Bachelier&#x27;s thesis was translated into English in 1964. But the work was never forgotten in the mathematical community, as Bachelier published a book in 1912 detailing his ideas, which was cited by mathematicians including Doob, Feller and Kolmogorov. The book continued to be cited, but then starting in the 1960s, the original thesis by Bachelier began to be cited more than his book when economists started citing Bachelier&#x27;s work.

In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper where he studied the physical observation of Brownian motion or movement to explain the seemingly random movements of particles in liquids by using ideas from the kinetic theory of gases. Einstein derived a differential equation, known as a diffusion equation, for describing the probability of finding a particle in a certain region of space. Shortly after Einstein&#x27;s first paper on Brownian movement, Marian Smoluchowski published work where he cited Einstein, but wrote that he had independently derived the equivalent results by using a different method.

Einstein&#x27;s work, as well as experimental results obtained by Jean Perrin, later inspired Norbert Wiener in the 1920s to use a type of measure theory, developed by Percy Daniell, and Fourier analysis to prove the existence of the Wiener process as a mathematical object.

====Poisson process====
The Poisson process is named after Siméon Poisson, due to its definition involving the Poisson distribution, but Poisson never studied the process. There are a number of claims for early uses or discoveries of the Poisson
process.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Poisson process would arise independently in different situations.
In Sweden 1903, Filip Lundberg published a thesis containing work, now considered fundamental and pioneering, where he proposed to model insurance claims with a homogeneous Poisson process.

Another discovery occurred in Denmark in 1909 when A.K. Erlang derived the Poisson distribution when developing a mathematical model for the number of incoming phone calls in a finite time interval. Erlang was not at the time aware of Poisson&#x27;s earlier work and assumed that the number phone calls arriving in each interval of time were independent to each other. He then found the limiting case, which is effectively recasting the Poisson distribution as a limit of the binomial distribution.

In 1910, Ernest Rutherford and Hans Geiger published experimental results on counting alpha particles. Motivated by their work, Harry Bateman studied the counting problem and derived Poisson probabilities as a solution to a family of differential equations, resulting in the independent discovery of the Poisson process. After this time there were many studies and applications of the Poisson process, but its early history is complicated, which has been explained by the various applications of the process in numerous fields by biologists, ecologists, engineers and various physical scientists.

====Markov processes====
Markov processes and Markov chains are named after Andrey Markov who studied Markov chains in the early 20th century. Markov was interested in studying an extension of independent random sequences. In his first paper on Markov chains, published in 1906, Markov showed that under certain conditions the average outcomes of the Markov chain would converge to a fixed vector of values, so proving a weak law of large numbers without the independence assumption, which had been commonly regarded as a requirement for such mathematical laws to hold. Markov later used Markov chains to study the distribution of vowels in Eugene Onegin, written by Alexander Pushkin, and proved a central limit theorem for such chains.

In 1912, Poincaré studied Markov chains on finite groups with an aim to study card shuffling. Other early uses of Markov chains include a diffusion model, introduced by Paul and Tatyana Ehrenfest in 1907, and a branching process, introduced by Francis Galton and Henry William Watson in 1873, preceding the work of Markov. After the work of Galton and Watson, it was later revealed that their branching process had been independently discovered and studied around three decades earlier by Irénée-Jules Bienaymé. Starting in 1928, Maurice Fréchet became interested in Markov chains, eventually resulting in him publishing in 1938 a detailed study on Markov chains.

Andrei Kolmogorov developed in a 1931 paper a large part of the early theory of continuous-time Markov processes. Kolmogorov was partly inspired by Louis Bachelier&#x27;s 1900 work on fluctuations in the stock market as well as Norbert Wiener&#x27;s work on Einstein&#x27;s model of Brownian movement. He introduced and studied a particular set of Markov processes known as diffusion processes, where he derived a set of differential equations describing the processes. Independent of Kolmogorov&#x27;s work, Sydney Chapman derived in a 1928 paper an equation, now called the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, in a less mathematically rigorous way than Kolmogorov, while studying Brownian movement. The differential equations are now called the Kolmogorov equations or the Kolmogorov–Chapman equations. Other mathematicians who contributed significantly to the foundations of Markov processes include William Feller, starting in the 1930s, and then later Eugene Dynkin, starting in the 1950s.

====Lévy processes====
Lévy processes such as the Wiener process and the Poisson process (on the real line) are named after Paul Lévy who started studying them in the 1930s, but they have connections to infinitely divisible distributions going back to the 1920s. In a 1932 paper, Kolmogorov derived a characteristic function for random variables associated with Lévy processes. This result was later derived under more general conditions by Lévy in 1934, and then Khinchin independently gave an alternative form for this characteristic function in 1937. In addition to Lévy, Khinchin and Kolomogrov, early fundamental contributions to the theory of Lévy processes were made by Bruno de Finetti and Kiyosi Itô.

==Mathematical construction==
In mathematics, constructions of mathematical objects are needed, which is also the case for stochastic processes, to prove that they exist mathematically. There are two main approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves considering a measurable space of functions, defining a suitable measurable mapping from a probability space to this measurable space of functions, and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.

Another approach involves defining a collection of random variables to have specific finite-dimensional distributions, and then using Kolmogorov&#x27;s existence theorem to prove a corresponding stochastic process exists. This theorem, which is an existence theorem for measures on infinite product spaces, says that if any finite-dimensional distributions satisfy two conditions, known as &quot;consistency conditions&quot;, then there exists a stochastic process with those finite-dimensional distributions.

===Construction issues===
When constructing continuous-time stochastic processes certain mathematical difficulties arise, due to the uncountable index sets, which do not occur with discrete-time processes. One problem is that it is possible to have more than one stochastic process with the same finite-dimensional distributions. For example, both the left-continuous modification and the right-continuous modification of a Poisson process have the same finite-dimensional distributions. This means that the distribution of the stochastic process does not, necessarily, specify uniquely the properties of the sample functions of the stochastic process.

Another problem is that functionals of continuous-time process that rely upon an uncountable number of points of the index set may not be measurable, so the probabilities of certain events may not be well-defined. For example, the supremum of a stochastic process or random field is not necessarily a well-defined random variable. For a continuous-time stochastic process formula_11, other characteristics that depend on an uncountable number of points of the index set formula_34 include:
* a sample function of a stochastic process formula_11 is a continuous function of formula_42;
* a sample function of a stochastic process formula_11 is a bounded function of formula_42; and
* a sample function of a stochastic process formula_11 is an increasing function of formula_42.
where the symbol ∈ can be read &quot;a member of the set&quot;, as in formula_15 a member of the set formula_34.

To overcome the two difficulties described above, i.e., &quot;more than one...&quot; and &quot;functionals of...&quot;, different assumptions and approaches are possible.

===Resolving construction issues===
One approach for avoiding mathematical construction issues of stochastic processes, proposed by Joseph Doob, is to assume that the stochastic process is separable. Separability ensures that infinite-dimensional distributions determine the properties of sample functions by requiring that sample functions are essentially determined by their values on a dense countable set of points in the index set. Furthermore, if a stochastic process is separable, then functionals of an uncountable number of points of the index set are measurable and their probabilities can be studied.

Another approach is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For the construction of such a stochastic process, it is assumed that the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This approach is now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.

Although less used, the separability assumption is considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It is also used when it is not possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space.

== Application ==

=== Applications in Finance ===

==== Black-Scholes Model ====
One of the most famous applications of stochastic processes in finance is the Black-Scholes model for option pricing. Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Solow, this model uses Geometric Brownian motion, a specific type of stochastic process, to describe the dynamics of asset prices. The model assumes that the price of a stock follows a continuous-time stochastic process and provides a closed-form solution for pricing European-style options. The Black-Scholes formula has had a profound impact on financial markets, forming the basis for much of modern options trading.

The key assumption of the Black-Scholes model is that the price of a financial asset, such as a stock, follows a log-normal distribution, with its continuous returns following a normal distribution. Although the model has limitations, such as the assumption of constant volatility, it remains widely used due to its simplicity and practical relevance.

==== Stochastic Volatility Models ====
Another significant application of stochastic processes in finance is in stochastic volatility models, which aim to capture the time-varying nature of market volatility. The Heston model is a popular example, allowing for the volatility of asset prices to follow its own stochastic process. Unlike the Black-Scholes model, which assumes constant volatility, stochastic volatility models provide a more flexible framework for modeling market dynamics, particularly during periods of high uncertainty or market stress.

=== Applications in Biology ===

==== Population Dynamics ====
One of the primary applications of stochastic processes in biology is in population dynamics. In contrast to deterministic models, which assume that populations change in predictable ways, stochastic models account for the inherent randomness in births, deaths, and migration. The birth-death process, a simple stochastic model, describes how populations fluctuate over time due to random births and deaths. These models are particularly important when dealing with small populations, where random events can have large impacts, such as in the case of endangered species or small microbial populations.

Another example is the branching process, which models the growth of a population where each individual reproduces independently. The branching process is often used to describe population extinction or explosion, particularly in epidemiology, where it can model the spread of infectious diseases within a population.

=== Applications in Computer Science ===

==== Randomized Algorithms ====
Stochastic processes play a critical role in computer science, particularly in the analysis and development of randomized algorithms. These algorithms utilize random inputs to simplify problem-solving or enhance performance in complex computational tasks. For instance, Markov chains are widely used in probabilistic algorithms for optimization and sampling tasks, such as those employed in search engines like Google&#x27;s PageRank. These methods balance computational efficiency with accuracy, making them invaluable for handling large datasets. Randomized algorithms are also extensively applied in areas such as cryptography, large-scale simulations, and artificial intelligence, where uncertainty must be managed effectively.

==== Queuing Theory ====
Another significant application of stochastic processes in computer science is in queuing theory, which models the random arrival and service of tasks in a system. This is particularly relevant in network traffic analysis and server management. For instance, queuing models help predict delays, manage resource allocation, and optimize throughput in web servers and communication networks. The flexibility of stochastic models allows researchers to simulate and improve the performance of high-traffic environments. For example, queueing theory is crucial for designing efficient data centers and cloud computing infrastructures.

<text>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a union territory of India comprising 572 islands, of which only 38 are inhabited. The islands are grouped into two main clusters: the northern Andaman Islands and the southern Nicobar Islands, separated by a wide channel. The capital and largest city of the territory, Port Blair (officially Sri Vijaya Puram), is located approximately from Chennai and from Kolkata in mainland India. The islands are situated between the Bay of Bengal to the west and the Andaman Sea to the east. The northernmost point is from the mouth of the Hooghly River. Indira Point, located at 6°45&#x27;10″N and 93°49&#x27;36″E on the southern tip of Great Nicobar, is the southernmost point of India.

The territory shares maritime borders with Indonesia located about to the south, Myanmar located to the north-east and Thailand located to the south-east. The islands occupy a total land area of approximately with a population of 380,581 as per the 2011 census. The territory is divided into three districts: Nicobar, South Andaman, and North and Middle Andaman with the capitals at Car Nicobar, Port Blair and Mayabunder respectively.

Genetic and cultural studies suggest that the indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations during the Middle Paleolithic era, more than 30,000 years ago. Archeological evidence of civilisation has been dated back to 2,200 years. In the 11th century CE, Cholas, one of the three Tamil kingdoms, used the islands as a naval base to launch expeditions in South East Asia. The Danish were the first Europeans to arrive on the islands in 1755. The islands became part of the British Raj in 1868. During the Second World War, the islands were invaded by the Japanese Empire. After Indian Independence in 1947, the region became a province and later a union territory after the adoption of the Constitution of India in 1950.

The islands host the Andaman and Nicobar Command, the only geographical command operated jointly by the three major wings of the Indian Armed Forces: the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. While Hindi and English are the official languages, the major spoken languages include Bengali, Tamil and Telugu. Indigenous people speak any of the Andamanese or Nicobarese family of languages. Hinduism is the majority religion in the union territory, with a significant Christian minority. The islands include the North Sentinel Island, home to the Sentinelese people, an uncontacted tribe.

==Etymology==
The name Andaman might have been derived from &quot;Handuman&quot;, after the Indian God Hanuman from the Hindu epic Ramayana. The place was called with a similar name by the Malay, who used to be involved in slave trade in the region. The place was also referred by various names such as &quot;Angademan&quot; by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE and &quot;Angamanian&quot; by Marco Polo in 13th century CE. Nicobar, which was located in the sea route connecting South India to South East Asia, was known as &quot;Nakkavaram&quot;, meaning &quot;open/naked land&quot; borrowed from Tamil language which later became &quot;Nicobar&quot;. In the middle ages (500-1500 AD), Nicobar was known as &quot;Lankhabatus&quot; in Arabia, probably a mis-transcription of the name &quot;Nakkavaram&quot;. An 11th-century CE work &quot;Kathasaritsagar&quot; indicates the name as &quot;Narikel Dweep&quot;. Marco Polo termed the island as &quot;Necuverann&quot;, while the islands were known as &quot;Lo-Jan Kuo&quot; in China, a translation of &quot;Nakkavar&quot; with the same meaning.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Genetic and cultural studies suggest that the indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations during the Middle Paleolithic era, which ended 30,000 years ago. Archeological evidence obtained from middens have been dated the earliest civilisations back to 200-300 BCE. The islands have been mentioned by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE.

=== Middle ages ===
The Nicobar islands existed on a major trade route connecting India to the South East Asia and had much contact with the outside world for centuries. But there are very few accounts of information as there was no written language with the indigenous people to document their history. The islands have been mentioned in the accounts of travellers like Faxian in the 6th century CE and I-T&#x27;sing in 7th century CE.

In the 11th century CE, Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty of Tamilakam invaded parts of South East Asia using the Nicobar islands as an intermediate naval base. It was part of an established Chola trade route connecting India and South East Asia, with the practice continuing in the subsequent years during the reigns of Rajendra II and Kulothunga I. Chola inscriptions from Thanjavur, dated to 1050 CE, describe the islands as &quot;Ma-Nakkavaram&quot; meaning &quot;great open/naked land&quot; in Tamil. The islands are later mentioned by Marco Polo in the 13th century CE and Friar Oderic in early 14th century CE.

=== European colonisation ===
The European colonisation on the islands began when settlers from the Danish East India Company arrived on the Nicobar Islands on 12 December 1755. On 1 January 1756, the Nicobar Islands were made into a Danish colony, first named &quot;Nye Danmark&quot; (New Denmark) and later &quot;Frederiksøerne&quot; (Frederick&#x27;s Islands). The islands were managed from the Danish colony of Tranquebar in the Indian mainland. However, various attempts to settle on the islands were unsuccessful due to repeated outbreaks of malaria, which led to the death of the colonists.

Between 1778 and 1783, William Bolts tried to establish an Austrian colony on the Nicobar islands, mistakenly assuming that the Danish had abandoned the claims to the islands, renaming them &quot;Theresa Islands&quot;. In 1789, the British colonised the Andaman islands to set up a naval base and establish a penal colony. In 1794, a first batch of 100 prisoners were sent to the island but the settlement was abandoned in 1796.

In 1858, the British established a colony near Port Blair. Between 1864 and 1868, Italy tried to buy the island from the Danish. On 16 October 1868, the Danish sold the rights to the Nicobar islands to the British, which was made part of the British India in 1869. In 1872, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were united under a single command and administered by a chief commissioner based out of Port Blair. The construction of the Cellular Jail started in 1896 and was completed in 1906. The jail was used to house political prisoners and independence activists away from the Indian mainland.

===World War II===
During the Second World War, the islands were invaded by the Japanese as a part of their attack on the allies in 1942. Port Blair was captured by the Japanese on 23 March 1942 and established control over the island. The provisional control was passed on to the Azad Hind of Subhash Chandra Bose on 29 December 1943, based on the understanding with the Japanese with the islands renamed as &quot;Shaheed-Dweep&quot; (Martyr Island) and &quot;Swaraj-dweep&quot; (Self-rule Island). Bose appointed General A. D. Loganathan as the governor of the islands, who had limited power while the real control of the islands remained with the Japanese. In the years under Japanese occupation, there have been reports of widespread looting, arson, rape and extra judicial killings.

Local people were often killed on trivial matters with the largest being the Homfreyganj massacre on 30 January 1944, where 44 local civilians were shot by the Japanese on suspicion of spying. Japanese Vice Admiral Teizo Hara and Major-General Tamenori Sato surrendered to Lieutenant Colonel Nathu Singh, the commanding officer of the Rajput Regiment on 15 August 1945, on board the Royal Navy warship HMS Sandbar and the territory was officially handed back over to the British to Brigadier J. A. Salomons, commander of 116th Indian Infantry Brigade, and Chief Administrator Noel Patterson, in a ceremony performed at the Gymkhana Ground in Port Blair on 7 October 1945.

=== Post independence ===
During the Partition of India, the British announced their intention to retain possession of the islands and use them to resettle Anglo-Indians and Anglo-Burmese on these islands. The islands were claimed by the Indian National Congress for India and the Muslim League for Pakistan during the partition negotiations. After the Indian Independence in 1947, the islands became part of the Dominion of India. As per the Constitution of India, the Islands were designated as the only part D territory in 1950, to be administered by a lieutenant governor appointed by the Government of India. The islands were later used to resettle people displaced during the partition with a substantial number of displaced immigrants establishing agricultural colonies. The islands became a separate union territory administered by the Government of India, following the re-organization in 1956. The islands have been developed into a key defence establishment since the 1980 due to its strategic location in the Bay of Bengal across the Strait of Malacca.

On 26 December 2004, the coasts of the Andaman and Nicobar islands experienced high tsunami waves following an undersea earthquake in the Indian Ocean which resulted in more than 2,000 casualties, 46,000 injuries and rendering at least 40,000 homeless. The locals and tourists on the islands suffered the greatest casualties while the indigenous people largely survived unscathed due to movement to high grounds following the oral traditions passed down over generations that warned them to evacuate following earthquakes.

==Geography==

The territory consists of 836 islands and islets occupying an area of , of which only 31 are permanently inhabited. The islands extend from 6° to 14° North latitudes and from 92° to 94° East longitudes. The islands are grouped into the north Andaman islands and south Nicobar islands, separated by the wide Ten Degree Channel. The Andamans cover an area of while the Nicobar group covers an area of . The highest point is the Saddle Peak at , located in North Andaman Island.
The northernmost point of the islands is away from the mouth of the Hooghly River in the Indian mainland. The territory shares maritime borders with Indonesia located about to the south, Myanmar located to the north-east and Thailand located to the south-east. Indira Point, the southernmost point of India, is located at 6°45&#x27;10″N and 93°49&#x27;36″E at the southern tip of Great Nicobar. The capital and largest city is Port Blair (officially Sri Vijaya Puram), located from Chennai and from Kolkata on the Indian mainland. Barren Island, the only active volcano in India, is located in the Andaman Sea.

The islands have a long coast-line. The topography of the territory varies significantly across various islands. The islands may have sandy, rocky sandstone or marshy beaches on the coastlines and might be surrounded by shoals and coral reefs. The altitude varies significantly from completely flat islands to gradually raising topography from the coast to the interior in larger islands. The islands are generally surrounded by shallow seas of varying depths in the vicinity with some deep natural bays occurring along certain coasts. The islands have a moderate temperature around the year with the average ranging from 23 °C to 31 °C. The islands have a tropical climate with warm summers and not so chill winters. The rainfall is dependent on the monsoons and tropical cyclones are common in late summer.

=== Flora and fauna ===
The islands have mangroves interspersed with marshes, coconut trees or dispersed bushy vegetation along the coast. There are twelve types of forests that occur in the islands including evergreen, deciduous, mangrove, littoral, bamboo, sub-montane and brackish water forests. North Andaman is characterised by wet evergreen forests with climbing plants, Middle Andaman has moist deciduous forests and South Andaman islands have epiphytic vegetation, mostly ferns and orchids. The North Nicobar islands are mostly barren with grasslands while evergreen forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. The forest coverage is estimated to be 86.2% of the total land area with about 2,200 varieties of plants of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India. There are more than 200 species used for timber.

There are more than 8300 species of fauna of which 1117 are endemic to the islands. There are about 64 species of reptiles of which half of them are endemic to the islands. Most of the larger species were introduced by colonists and travellers, some of which became endemic due to their prolonged isolation. There are about 55 mammal species of which 32 are endemic with 26 species of rats and 14 species of bats, the most among the mammals. The endangered Indian elephant can be found in forested or mountainous areas of the islands, which were originally introduced from the mainland to help with the timber extraction in 1883. Endangered and critically endangered species endemic to the islands include the Andaman white-toothed shrew, Andaman spiny shrew, Jenkin&#x27;s shrew, Nicobar spiny shrew, Nicobar tree shrew, Miller&#x27;s Nicobar rat, Palm rat, Andaman teal, Nicobar scops owl, Andaman boobook and Darwin&#x27;s eastern frog. Other large fauna include Wild boar, Spotted deer, Barking deer and Sambar deer.

There are about 270 species of birds in the islands of which 90 are endemic. The islands&#x27; caves are nesting grounds for the Edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are prized for bird&#x27;s nest soup. The islands serve as an intermediate resting site for birds such as Horsfield&#x27;s bronze cuckoo, Zappey&#x27;s flycatcher and Javan pond heron during long distance migrations. The Nicobar pigeon found in the islands is the closest living relative to the extinct Dodo. The territory is home for about 896 species of winged insects including 225 butterflies species.

There are more than 1350 species of echinoderms and molluscs and 200 species of corals in the seas surrounding the islands. Larger marine species include salt water crocodiles, dugongs, turtles, dolphins and whales. There are more than 1350 species of fishes including 13 fresh water species. The islands are well known for prized shellfish, the commercial exploitation of which began in the early 20th century. There are about nine national parks, 96 wildlife sanctuaries and one biosphere reserve in the islands.

==Demographics==
As per the 2011 census, the population was 380,581, of which 202,871 (53.3%) were males and 177,710 (46.7%) were females. The sex ratio was 878 females per 1,000 males. There were a total of 94,551 households and about 143,488 (37.7%) of the population lived in urban areas. Hinduism (69.5%) is the major religion of people of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands followed by Christianity (21.7%) and Islam (8.5%).
The Andaman islands were populated by the indigenous people (the Great Andamanese, the Onge, the Jarawa and the Sentinelese) who were isolated and spoke Andamanese languages for thousands of years. The Nicobar islands, which was part of trade routes and was frequented by travellers, were populated by Shompen people before the islands were settled by Nicobarese people, who spoke Austroasiatic languages. The islands include the North Sentinel Island, home to the Sentinelese people, among the only known uncontacted tribe in India. When the islands were first colonised, the population of the natives were estimated to be around 5,000 and while the population of islands temporarily increased during colonisation, the population saw a massive spike post-1960s due to the policies of the Union Government that encouraged settlers from other parts of the country. In the early 21st century, the population of indigenous people has drastically dropped and , it was estimated to consist of 44 Great Andamanese, 380 Jarawas, 101 Onges, 15 Sentinelese and 229 Shompens. The Government of India is trying to protect the remnant population by providing access to healthcare facilities, communication and social engagement.

===Languages===
The Andamanese people speak about a dozen endangered Andamanese languages, which belong to two families, Great Andamanese and Ongan that are unrelated to each other or to any other language group. There are two unattested languages: Sentinelese, spoken by Sentinelese people, who refuse contact with outsiders, which might be related to Ongan as per Anvita Abbi and Jangil, which became extinct in the 1920s. Indigenous to the Nicobar Islands are the Shompen language, spoken by Shompen people and the five Nicobarese languages, which form part of the Austroasiatic language family and are spoken by about people or 7.6% of the population.

The majority of the population, however, are speakers of immigrant languages which include Bengali (28.5%), Tamil (15.2%), Telugu (13.2%), Hindi (12.9%), Malayalam (7.2%). Sadri (5.5%), and Kurukh (4%). Hindi is the official language of the region, while English is declared an additional official language for communication purposes.

== Administration and politics ==
The islands form a part of the union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and is administered by a Lieutenant Governor on behalf of the Government of India. The union territory was established in 1956 with a chief commissioner as the head of the administration. In 1982, the Lieutenant Governor replaced the Chief Commissioner as the head of administration.
In 1981, a &quot;Pradesh council&quot; with councillors as representatives of the people was constituted to advise the Lieutenant Governor. The territory sends one representative to Lok Sabha of the Indian Parliament from its Andaman and Nicobar Islands Lok Sabha constituency. The territory is divided into three districts, each headed by a deputy commissioner. The Calcutta High Court has jurisdiction over the islands with a permanent seat at Port Blair.

The indigenous communities have their own system of administration. There are long term settlements known as &quot;baraij&quot; and short-term settlements known as &quot;chang&quot;. The coast-dwellers (&quot;aryoto&quot;) have semi-permanent settlements and the interior groups (&quot;eremtaga&quot;) dwell on temporary settlements, which enable them to migrate during dry seasons.

==Economy==
, the GSDP was . Agriculture is a major occupation with nearly 50% of the population engaged in the sector. Only about of land, which is about 6% of the total land area, can be used for agriculture. Rice is the main food crop, grown in about 20% of the arable land. Most of the food for consumption is imported from mainland India. Coconut and arecanut are the cash crops grown in the Nicobar islands. Other crops include pulses, oilseeds, vegetables like okra, brinjal, cucurbit and radish; spices and fruits such as mango, sapota, orange, banana, guava and pineapple. Rubber, red oil, palm and cashew are grown on a limited scale in plantations. The territory has an exclusive economic zone of more than 0.6 million sq. km, which contributes to the fishing industry. , the region produced 27,526 tonnes of fish, mostly from marine sector with minor contribution from inland fisheries.

, there were 1,833 registered small-scale industries with majority being involved in engineering, woodworking and textiles apart from 21 factories. District Industries Centre (DIC) is the body responsible for the development of small and medium industries in the islands. Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation Limited (ANIIDCO), established in 1988, is responsible for the development and economic growth of the islands.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism is one of the major contributors to the economy of the islands. The islands had more than 400,000 visitors in 2016 with a 94% contribution from domestic tourists. In 2018, plans to develop facilities in various islands under the National Institute of Transforming India (NITI) Aayog was initiated by Government of India, with the aim of increasing tourist inflows. Foreign tourists are issued Restricted Area Permits (RAP) which gives access to specific areas with conditions. While domestic tourists do not require a permit to visit the accessible parts of the islands, the tribal reserves are forbidden and requires special permission for access. The islands have many beaches due to its long coastline and various water sports are practised including kayaking, scuba diving and parasailing.

Major attractions include the Cellular Jail, Chatham Saw Mill, Forest Museum, Samudrika Naval Marine Museum, Anthropological Museum, Fisheries Aquarium, Science Center and Carbyn&#x27;s cove in Port Blair; Bharatpur, Lakshmanpur and Sitapur beaches in Shaheed Dweep; Elephant and Radhanagar beaches in Swaraj Dweep; Hudi tikri, Red, Bird and Bat islands, Amkunj beach near Rangat; Dhaninallah mangroves and Karmatang beach near Mayabunder; limestone caves and mud volcanoes near Diglipur; Craggy island and Ross &amp; Smith islands and various national parks and protected sanctuaries.

The islands have an installed power capacity of 68.46 MW with majority of the power generated from diesel power plants and a single hydroelectric powerplant of 5.25 MW on Kalpong river. In 2016, a new 15 MW diesel power plant was established in South Andaman with Japanese assistance. Commissioned in June 2020, a 10 MW photovoltaic power station is operated by NLC India in Port Blair. In 2022, the government proposed additional power plants and infrastructure to be developed in Great Nicobar.

=== Telecommunication ===
4G mobile service is provided by various telecom operators in the islands. Till 2020, Internet was provided through satellite links and access was limited. Bharat Broadband Network started work on laying fiber optic submarine cables connecting the islands with Chennai in December 2018.

<text>Elizabeth Woodville (also spelt Wydville, Wydeville, or Widvile; c. 1437 – 8 June 1492), later known as Dame Elizabeth Grey, was Queen of England from 1 May 1464 until 3 October 1470 and from 11 April 1471 until 9 April 1483 as the wife of King Edward IV. She was a key figure in the Wars of the Roses, a dynastic civil war between the Lancastrian and the Yorkist factions between 1455 and 1487.

At the time of her birth, Elizabeth&#x27;s family was of middle rank in the English social hierarchy. Her mother, Jacquetta of Luxembourg, had previously been an aunt-by-marriage to King Henry VI, and was the daughter of Peter I, Count of Saint-Pol. Elizabeth&#x27;s first marriage was to a minor supporter of the House of Lancaster, John Grey of Groby. He died at the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461, leaving Elizabeth a widowed mother of two young sons.

Elizabeth&#x27;s second marriage, in 1464, to Edward IV became a cause célèbre. Elizabeth was known for her beauty but came from minor nobility with no great estates, and the marriage took place in secret. Edward was the first king of England since the Norman Conquest to marry one of his subjects, and Elizabeth was the first such consort to be crowned queen. The couple had ten children together. The marriage greatly enriched Elizabeth&#x27;s siblings and children, but their advancement incurred the hostility of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, &quot;The Kingmaker&quot;, and his various alliances with the most senior figures in the increasingly divided royal family. This hostility turned into open discord between King Edward and Warwick, leading to a battle of wills that finally resulted in Warwick&#x27;s switching allegiance to the Lancastrian cause, and to the execution of Elizabeth&#x27;s father, Richard Woodville, and her brother, John, by Warwick in 1469.

After the death of her husband in 1483, Elizabeth remained politically influential even after her son, briefly proclaimed King Edward V, was deposed by her brother-in-law, Richard III. Edward and his younger brother Richard both disappeared soon afterwards, and are presumed by some historians to have been murdered on Richard III&#x27;s orders; conversely, there is evidence to the contrary as well, and it is uncertain who actually was responsible for their disappearances. Elizabeth subsequently played an important role in securing the accession of Henry VII in 1485.

Henry married Elizabeth&#x27;s eldest daughter, Elizabeth of York, which ended the Wars of the Roses and established the Tudor dynasty. Through her daughter, Elizabeth Woodville was a grandmother of the future Henry VIII. Elizabeth was forced to yield pre-eminence to Henry VII&#x27;s mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort; her influence on events in these years, and her eventual departure from court into retirement, remain obscure.

==Early life and first marriage==

Elizabeth Woodville was born in about 1437 (no record of her birth survives), at Grafton Regis, Northamptonshire. She was the firstborn child of a socially unequal marriage between Richard Woodville and Jacquetta of Luxembourg, which briefly scandalised the English court. The Woodvilles, though an old and respectable family, were gentry rather than noble, a landed and wealthy family that had previously produced commissioners of the peace, sheriffs, and MPs, rather than peers of the realm. Elizabeth&#x27;s mother, in contrast, was the eldest daughter of Peter I of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, Conversano and Brienne, and as the widow of John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, uncle of King Henry VI of England, was before her second marriage one of the highest ranking women in England. As Jacquetta had pledged, upon the death of her first husband, that she would not remarry without first obtaining royal permission, and as royal permission to marry Woodville was out of the question, the pair married secretly. When the marriage became public knowledge, the couple was heavily fined, but was pardoned on 24 October 1437: it has been conjectured that the pardon coincided with the birth of Elizabeth, the couple&#x27;s firstborn child.

Around 1452, Elizabeth Woodville married John Grey of Groby, the heir to the Barony Ferrers of Groby. He was killed at the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461, fighting for the Lancastrian cause. This would become a source of irony, since Elizabeth&#x27;s future husband Edward IV was the Yorkist claimant to the throne. Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s two sons from this first marriage were Thomas Grey (later Marquess of Dorset) and Richard Grey.

Elizabeth Woodville was called &quot;the most beautiful woman in the Island of Britain&quot; with &quot;heavy-lidded eyes like those of a dragon&quot;.

==Queen consort==

Edward IV had many mistresses, the best known of them being Jane Shore, and he did not have a reputation for fidelity. His marriage to the widowed Elizabeth Woodville took place secretly and, though there is no documentary evidence of the date, it is traditionally said to have taken place at her family home in Northamptonshire on 1 May 1464. Only the bride&#x27;s mother and two ladies were in attendance. Edward married her just over three years after he had assumed the English throne in the wake of his overwhelming victory over the Lancastrians, at the Battle of Towton, which resulted in the displacement of King Henry VI. Edward introduced Elizabeth Woodville as his queen to the royal court at Reading Abbey on Michaelmas Day (29 September 1464). Elizabeth Woodville was crowned queen on 26 May 1465, a few days after Ascension Day.

In the early years of his reign, Edward IV&#x27;s governance of England was dependent upon a small circle of supporters, most notably his cousin, Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick. At around the time of Edward IV&#x27;s secret marriage, Warwick was negotiating an alliance with France in an effort to thwart a similar arrangement being made by his sworn enemy Margaret of Anjou, wife of the deposed Henry VI. The plan was that Edward IV should marry a French princess. When his marriage to Elizabeth, who was both a commoner and from a family of Lancastrian supporters, became public Warwick was both embarrassed and offended. His relationship with Edward IV was ruined. The match was also badly received by the privy council, who according to Jean de Waurin told Edward with great frankness that &quot;he must know that she was no wife for a prince such as himself&quot;.

With the arrival on the scene of the new queen came many relatives, some of whom married into the most notable families in England. Three of her sisters married the sons of the earls of Kent, Essex and Pembroke. Another sister, Catherine Woodville, married the queen&#x27;s 11-year-old ward Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who later joined Edward IV&#x27;s brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, in opposition to the Woodvilles after the death of Edward IV. Elizabeth&#x27;s 20-year-old brother John married Katherine, Duchess of Norfolk, Edward IV and Warwick&#x27;s aunt. The Duchess had been widowed three times and was in her sixties, so the marriage created a scandal at court. Elizabeth&#x27;s son, Thomas Grey, married firstly Anne Holland, a niece of Edward, and later Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington.

Elizabeth&#x27;s status as a commoner before her sudden, secret marriage to Edward was primarily the reason for the backlash against her queenship. She was often seen as arrogant and disrespectful for actions that would be seen as normal by a lady of higher rank, such as her predecessor Margaret of Anjou. Such was Elizabeth&#x27;s unpopularity that George, Duke of Clarence, rebellious brother of her husband, later even accused her of witchcraft in order to murder his wife Isabel Neville. Most historians now believe that Isabel died of either consumption or childbed fever.

When Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s relatives, especially her brother Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, began to challenge Warwick&#x27;s pre-eminence in English political society, Warwick conspired with his son-in-law George, Duke of Clarence, the king&#x27;s younger brother. One of his followers accused Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s mother, Jacquetta of Luxembourg, of practising witchcraft. She was acquitted the following year.

Warwick and Clarence twice rose in revolt and then fled to France. Warwick formed an uneasy alliance with the Lancastrian Queen Margaret of Anjou, executed Elizabeth&#x27;s father and brother after the Yorkist defeat at the Battle of Edgecote, and restored Margaret&#x27;s husband Henry VI to the throne in 1470. But the following year, Edward IV returned from exile and defeated Warwick at the Battle of Barnet, and the Lancastrians at the Battle of Tewkesbury. Henry VI was killed soon afterwards.

Following her husband&#x27;s temporary fall from power, Elizabeth Woodville sought sanctuary in Westminster Abbey, where she gave birth to a son, Edward (later King Edward V of England). Her marriage to Edward IV produced a total of ten children, including another son, Richard, Duke of York, who would later join his brother as one of the Princes in the Tower. Five daughters also lived to adulthood.

Elizabeth Woodville engaged in acts of Christian piety in keeping with conventional expectations of a medieval queen consort. She also became a patroness of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. Her acts included making pilgrimages, obtaining a papal indulgence for those who knelt and said the Angelus three times per day, and founding the chapel of St. Erasmus in Westminster Abbey.

==Queen dowager==
Following Edward IV&#x27;s sudden death, possibly from pneumonia or being worn out from &quot;high living&quot;, in April 1483, Elizabeth Woodville became queen dowager. Her young son, Edward V, became king, with his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, acting as Lord Protector. In response to the Woodvilles&#x27; attempt to monopolise power, Gloucester quickly moved to take control of the young king and had the king&#x27;s uncle Earl Rivers and half-brother Richard Grey, son to Elizabeth, arrested. The young king was transferred to the Tower of London to await the coronation. With her younger son and daughters, Elizabeth again sought sanctuary. Lord Hastings, the late king&#x27;s leading supporter in London, initially endorsed Gloucester&#x27;s actions, but Gloucester then accused him of conspiring with Elizabeth Woodville against him. Hastings was summarily executed. Whether any such conspiracy really occurred is not known. Richard accused Elizabeth of plotting to &quot;murder and utterly destroy&quot; him.

On 25 June 1483, Gloucester had Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s son Richard Grey and brother Anthony, Earl Rivers, executed in Pontefract Castle, Yorkshire. The &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; – an act of parliament – declared that Edward IV&#x27;s children with Elizabeth were illegitimate on the grounds that Edward IV had a precontract with the widow Lady Eleanor Butler, which was considered a legally binding contract that rendered any other marriage contract invalid. One source, the Burgundian chronicler Philippe de Commines, says that Robert Stillington, Bishop of Bath and Wells, carried out an engagement ceremony between Edward IV and Lady Eleanor. The act also contained charges of witchcraft against Elizabeth, but gave no details and the charges had no further repercussions. As a consequence, the Duke of Gloucester and Lord Protector was offered the throne and became King Richard III. Edward V, who was no longer king, and his brother Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, remained in the Tower of London. There are no recorded sightings of them after the summer of 1483.

Additionally, Elizabeth was stripped of all her entitlements as queen dowager and her lands reverted to the Crown. She was granted most, but not all, of these lands back in March 1486 by Henry VII.

==Life under Richard III==

Now referred to as Dame Elizabeth Grey, she and Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham (a former close ally of Richard III and now probably seeking the throne for himself) allied themselves with Margaret Stanley (née Beaufort) and espoused the cause of Margaret&#x27;s son Henry Tudor, a great-great-great-grandson of King Edward III, the closest male heir of the Lancastrian claim to the throne with any degree of validity. To strengthen his claim and unite the two feuding noble houses, Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Beaufort agreed that the latter&#x27;s son should marry the former&#x27;s eldest daughter, Elizabeth of York, who upon the death of her brothers became the heiress of the House of York. Henry Tudor agreed to this plan and in December 1483 publicly swore an oath to that effect in the cathedral in Rennes, Brittany. A month earlier, an uprising in his favour, led by Buckingham, had been crushed.

Richard III&#x27;s first Parliament of January 1484 stripped Elizabeth of all the lands given to her during Edward IV&#x27;s reign. On 1 March 1484, Elizabeth and her daughters came out of sanctuary after Richard III publicly swore an oath that her daughters would not be harmed or molested and that they would not be imprisoned in the Tower of London or in any other prison. He also promised to provide them with marriage portions and to marry them to &quot;gentlemen born&quot;. Richard also awarded Elizabeth a pension of 700 Marks per year. The family returned to Court, apparently reconciled to Richard III. After the death of Richard III&#x27;s wife Anne Neville, in March 1485, rumours arose that the newly widowed king was going to marry his niece Elizabeth of York. It is known that Richard was in negotiation to marry Joana of Portugal and to marry off Elizabeth to Manuel, Duke of Beja.

==Life under Henry VII==

In 1485, Henry Tudor invaded England and defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field. As king, Henry VII married Elizabeth of York and had the Titulus Regius revoked and all found copies destroyed. Elizabeth Woodville was accorded the title and honours of a queen dowager.

Scholars differ about why Dowager Queen Elizabeth spent the last five years of her life living at Bermondsey Abbey, to which she retired on 12 February 1487. Among her modern biographers, David Baldwin believes that Henry VII forced her retreat from the court, while Arlene Okerlund presents evidence from July 1486 that she was already planning her retirement from court to live a religious, contemplative life at Bermondsey Abbey. Another suggestion is that her retreat to Bermondsey was forced on her because she was in some way involved in the 1487 Yorkist rebellion of Lambert Simnel, or at least was seen as a potential ally of the rebels.

At Bermondsey Abbey, Elizabeth was treated with the respect due to a dowager queen. She lived on a pension of £400 and received small gifts from Henry VII. She was present at the birth of her granddaughter Margaret at Westminster Palace in November 1489 and at the birth of her grandson, the future Henry VIII, at Greenwich Palace in June 1491. Her daughter Elizabeth of York, wife of Henry VII, visited her on occasion at Bermondsey, although another one of her other daughters, Cecily of York, visited her more often.

Henry VII briefly contemplated marrying his mother-in-law to King James III of Scotland, when James III&#x27;s wife, Margaret of Denmark, died in 1486. James was killed in battle in 1488.

Elizabeth Woodville died at Bermondsey Abbey, on 8 June 1492. With the exception of the queen, who was awaiting the birth of her fourth child, and Cecily of York, her daughters attended the funeral at Windsor Castle: Anne of York (the future wife of Thomas Howard), Catherine of York (the future Countess of Devon) and Bridget of York (a nun at Dartford Priory). Elizabeth&#x27;s will specified a simple ceremony. The surviving accounts of her funeral on 12 June 1492 suggest that at least one source &quot;clearly felt that a queen&#x27;s funeral should have been more splendid&quot; and may have objected that &quot;Henry VII had not been fit to arrange a more queenly funeral for his mother-in-law&quot;, although simplicity was the queen dowager&#x27;s own wish. A letter discovered in 2019, written in 1511 by Andrea Badoer, the Venetian ambassador in London, suggests that she had died of plague, which would explain the haste and lack of public ceremony. Elizabeth was laid to rest in the same chantry as her husband King Edward IV in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

==In literature==
One of only three lyric poems in Middle English ascribed to a woman author, alongside &quot;An Anchoress&#x27; Hymn to the Virgin&quot; and &quot;Eleanor Percy&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, &quot;My heart is set upon a lusty pin&quot; is attributed to one &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, sometimes thought to have been Elizabeth Woodville (although the author is also argued to have been her daughter, Elizabeth of York). This hymn to Venus, found in one single manuscript, is a complex six-stanza poem with rhyme scheme ABABBAA, an &quot;elaboration of the sestina,&quot; in which the seventh line of each stanza is the same as its first, and the six unique lines of the first stanza provide the first lines for each of the poem&#x27;s six stanzas.

=== Fiction ===

Edward IV&#x27;s love for his wife is celebrated in sonnet 75 of Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot;. (written by 1586, first pub. 1591).

She appears in two of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays: &quot;Henry VI Part 3&quot; (written by 1592), in which she is a fairly minor character, and &quot;Richard III&quot; (written approx. 1592), where she has a central role. Shakespeare portrays Elizabeth as a proud and alluring woman in &quot;Henry VI Part 3&quot;. By &quot;Richard III,&quot; she is careworn from having to defend herself against detractors in the court, including her titular brother-in-law, Richard. She spends much of the play bemoaning her fate as family members and supporters of her are killed, including her two young sons. She is one of Richard&#x27;s cleverest opponents and among the few who see through him from the beginning, though she is mostly powerless to stop him once he murders her allies in the court. Although most modern editions of &quot;Henry VI Part 3&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot; call her &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; in the stage directions, the original Shakespearean Folio never actually refer to her by name, instead calling her first &quot;Lady Grey&quot; and later simply &quot;Queen.&quot;

<text>Uploading refers to &quot;transmitting&quot; data from one computer system to another through means of a network. Common methods of uploading include: uploading via web browsers, FTP clients, and terminals (SCP/SFTP). Uploading can be used in the context of (potentially many) clients that send files to a central server. While uploading can also be defined in the context of sending files between distributed clients, such as with a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol like BitTorrent, the term file sharing is more often used in this case. Moving files within a computer system, as opposed to over a network, is called file copying. 

Uploading directly contrasts with downloading, where data is &quot;received&quot; over a network. In the case of users uploading files over the internet, uploading is often slower than downloading as many internet service providers (ISPs) offer asymmetric connections, which offer more network bandwidth for downloading than uploading.

==Definition==
To transfer something (such as data or files), from a computer or other digital device to the memory of another device (such as a larger or remote computer) especially via the internet.

==Historical development==
Remote file sharing first came into fruition in January 1978, when Ward Christensen and Randy Suess, who were members of the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists&#x27; Exchange (CACHE), created the Computerized Bulletin Board System (CBBS). This used an early file transfer protocol (MODEM, later XMODEM) to send binary files via a hardware modem, accessible by another modem via a telephone number.

In the following years, new protocols such as Kermit were released, until the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) was standardized 1985 (). FTP is based on TCP/IP and gave rise to many FTP clients, which, in turn, gave users all around the world access to the same standard network protocol to transfer data between devices.

The transfer of data saw a significant increase in popularity after the release of the World Wide Web in 1991, which, for the first time, allowed users who were not computer hobbyists to easily share files, directly from their web browser over HTTP.

===Resumability of file transfers===
Transfers became more reliable with the launch of HTTP/1.1 in 1997 (), which gave users the option to resume downloads that were interrupted, for instance due to unreliable connections. Before web browsers widely rolled out support, software programs like GetRight could be used to resume downloads. Resuming uploads is not currently supported by HTTP, but can be added with the Tus open protocol for resumable file uploads, which layers resumability of uploads on top of existing HTTP connections.

==Types of uploading==

===Client-to-server uploading=== 
Transmitting a local file to a remote system following the client–server model, e.g., a web browser transferring a video to a website, is called client-to-server uploading.

===Remote uploading===
Transferring data from one remote system to another remote system under the control of a local system is called remote uploading or site-to-site transferring. This is used when a local computer has a slow connection to the remote systems, but these systems have a fast connection between them. Without remote uploading functionality, the data would have to first be downloaded to the local system and then uploaded to the remote server, both times over a slower connection. Remote uploading is used by some online file hosting services. Another example can be found in FTP clients, which often support the File eXchange Protocol (FXP) in order to instruct two FTP servers with high-speed connections to exchange files. A web-based example is the Uppy file uploader that can transfer files from a user&#x27;s cloud storage such as Dropbox, directly to a website without first going to the user&#x27;s device.

===Peer-to-peer=== 
Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a decentralized communications model in which each party has the same capabilities, and either party can initiate a communication session. Unlike the client–server model, in which the client makes a service request and the server fulfils the request (by sending or accepting a file transfer), the P2P network model allows each node to function as both client and server. BitTorrent is an example of this, as is the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Peer-to-peer allows users to both &quot;receive&quot; (download) and &quot;host&quot; (upload) content. Files are transferred directly between the users&#x27; computers. The same file transfer constitutes an upload for one party, and a download for the other party.

==Copyright issues==
The rising popularity of file sharing during the 1990s culminated in the emergence of Napster, a music-sharing platform specialized in MP3 files that used peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing technology to allow users exchange files freely. The P2P nature meant there was no central gatekeeper for the content, which eventually led to the widespread availability of copyrighted material through Napster.

The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) took notice of Napster&#x27;s ability to distribute copyrighted music among its user base, and, on December 6, 1999, filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in order to stop the exchange of copyrighted songs on the service. After a failed appeal by Napster, the injunction was granted on March 5, 2001. On September 24, 2001, Napster, which had already shut down its entire network two months earlier, agreed to pay a $26 million dollar settlement. 

After Napster had ceased operations, many other P2P file-sharing services also shut down, such as Limewire, Kazaa and Popcorn Time. Besides software programs, there were many BitTorrent websites that allowed files to be indexed and searched. These files could then be downloaded via a BitTorrent client. While the BitTorrent protocol itself is legal and agnostic of the type of content shared, many of the services that did not enforce a strict policy to take down copyrighted material would eventually also run into legal difficulties.

<doc id="47905" wikidata="Q1348" url="?curid=47905" title="Kolkata">
<text>Kolkata, also known as Calcutta (its official name until 2001), is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of West Bengal. It lies on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, west of the border with Bangladesh. It is the primary financial and commercial centre of eastern and northeastern India. Kolkata is the seventh most populous city in India with an estimated city proper population of 4.5 million (0.45 crore) while its metropolitan region Kolkata Metropolitan Area is third most populous metropolitan region of India with a metro population of over 15 million (1.5 crore). Kolkata is regarded by many sources as the cultural capital of India and a historically and culturally significant city in the historic region of Bengal.

The three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690, the area was developed by the Company into Fort William. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied the fort in 1756 but was defeated at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, after his general Mir Jafar mutinied in support of the company, and was later made the Nawab for a brief time. Under company and later crown rule, Calcutta served as the de facto capital of India until 1911. Calcutta was the second largest city in the British Empire, after London, and was the centre of bureaucracy, politics, law, education, science and the arts in India. The city was associated with many of the figures and movements of the Bengali Renaissance. It was the hotbed of the Indian nationalist movement.

The partition of Bengal in 1947 affected the fortunes of the city. Following independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the premier centre of Indian commerce, culture, and politics, suffered many decades of political violence and economic stagnation before it rebounded. In the late 20th century, the city hosted the government-in-exile of Bangladesh during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. It was also flooded with Hindu refugees from East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) in the decades following the 1947 partition of India, transforming its landscape and shaping its politics. The city was overtaken by Mumbai (formerly Bombay) as India&#x27;s largest city.

A demographically diverse city, the culture of Kolkata features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (&quot;paras&quot;) and freestyle conversations (&quot;adda&quot;). Kolkata&#x27;s architecture includes many imperial landmarks, including the Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge and the Grand Hotel. The city&#x27;s heritage includes India&#x27;s only Chinatown and remnants of Jewish, Armenian, Greek and Anglo-Indian communities. The city is closely linked with Bhadralok culture and the Zamindars of Bengal, including Bengali Hindu, Bengali Muslim and tribal aristocrats. The city is often regarded as India&#x27;s cultural capital.

Kolkata is home to institutions of national importance, including the Academy of Fine Arts, the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum and the National Library of India. The University of Calcutta, first modern university in south Asia and its affiliated colleges produced many leading figures of South Asia. It is the centre of the Indian Bengali film industry, which is known as Tollywood. Among scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the Zoological Survey of India, the Horticultural Society, the Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. The Port of Kolkata is India&#x27;s oldest operating port. Four Nobel laureates and two Nobel Memorial Prize winners are associated with the city. Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata stands out in India for being the country&#x27;s centre of association football. Kolkata is known for its grand celebrations of the Hindu festival of Durga Puja, which is recognized by UNESCO for its importance to world heritage. Kolkata is also known as the &quot; &quot;City of Joy&quot;&quot;.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;Kolkata&quot; ( ) derives from &quot;Kôlikata&quot; ( ), the Bengali language name of one of three villages that predated the arrival of the British; the other two villages were Sutanuti and Govindapur.

There are several explanations for the etymology of this name:
* &quot;Kolikata&quot; is thought to be a variation of &quot;Kalikkhetrô&quot; ( ), meaning &#x27;Field of [the goddess] Kali&#x27;. Similarly, it can be a variation of &quot;Kalikshetra&quot; (Sanskrit: कालीक्षेत्र, lit. &#x27;area of Goddess Kali&#x27;).
* Another theory is that the name derives from Kalighat.
* Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Bengali term &quot;kilkila&quot; (), or &#x27;flat area&#x27;.
* The name may have its origin in the words &quot;khal&quot; ( ) meaning &#x27;canal&#x27;, followed by &quot;kaṭa&quot; ( ), which may mean &#x27;dug&#x27;.
* According to another theory, the area specialised in the production of quicklime or &quot;koli chun&quot; ( ) and coir or &quot;kata&quot; ( ); hence, it was called &quot;Kolikata&quot;).
Although the city&#x27;s name has always been pronounced &quot;Kolkata&quot; or &quot;Kôlikata&quot; in Bengali, the anglicised form &quot;Calcutta&quot; was the official name until 2001, when it was changed to &quot;Kolkata&quot; in order to match Bengali pronunciation.

== History ==
The discovery and archaeological study of Chandraketugarh, north of Kolkata, provide evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited for over two millennia. Kolkata or Kalikata in its earliest mentions, is described to be a village surrounded with jungle on the bank of river Ganga as a renowned port, commercial hub and a hindu pilgrimage site for Kalighat Temple. The first mention of the Kalikata village was found in Bipradas Pipilai&#x27;s &quot;Manasa Vijay&quot; (1495), where he describes how Chand Sadagar used to stop in Kalighat to worship Goddess Kali during his path to trade voyage. Later Kalikata was also found to be mentioned in Mukundaram Chakrabarti&#x27;s &quot;Chandimangal&quot; (1594), Todar Mal&#x27;s taxation-list in 1596 and Krishnaram Das&#x27;s &quot;Kalikamangal&quot; (1676–77). Kalighat was then considered a safe place for businessmen. They used to carry on trade through the Bhagirathi and took shelter there at night. Kolkata&#x27;s recorded history began in 1690 with the arrival of the English East India Company, which was consolidating its trade business in Bengal. Job Charnock is often regarded as the founder of the city; however, in response to a public petition, the Calcutta High Court ruled in 2003 that the city does not have a founder. The area occupied by the present-day city encompassed three villages: Kalikata, Gobindapur and Sutanuti. Kalikata was a fishing village, where a handful of merchants began their operations by building a factory; Sutanuti was a riverside weavers&#x27; village; and Gobindapur was a trading post for Indian merchant princes. These villages were part of an estate belonging to the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family of &quot;zamindars&quot;. The estate was sold to the East India Company in 1698.

In 1712, the British completed the construction of Fort William, located on the east bank of the Hooghly River to protect their trading factory. Facing frequent skirmishes with French forces, the British began to upgrade their fortifications in 1756. The Nawab of Bengal, Siraj-ud-Daulah, condemned the militarisation and tax evasion by the company. His warning went unheeded, and the Nawab attacked; his capture of Fort William led to the killings of several East India company officials in the Black Hole of Calcutta. A force of Company soldiers (&quot;sepoys&quot;) and British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year. Per the 1765 Treaty of Allahabad following the battle of Buxar, East India company was appointed imperial tax collector of the Mughal emperor in the province of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, while Mughal-appointed Nawabs continued to rule the province. Declared a presidency city, Calcutta became the headquarters of the East India Company by 1773.

In 1793, ruling power of the Nawabs were abolished, and East India company took complete control of the city and the province. In the early 19th century, the marshes surrounding the city were drained; the government area was laid out along the banks of the Hooghly River. Richard Wellesley, Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William between 1797 and 1805, was largely responsible for the development of the city and its public architecture. Throughout the late 18th and 19th century, the city was a centre of the East India Company&#x27;s opium trade. A census in 1837 records the population of the city proper as 229,700, of which the British residents made up only 3,138. The same source says another 177,000 resided in the suburbs and neighbouring villages, making the entire population of greater Calcutta 406,700.

In 1864, a typhoon struck the city and killed about 60,000 in Kolkata.

By the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, which was primarily British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta. The city underwent rapid industrial growth starting in the early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included telegraph connections and . The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted in the emergence of a new &quot;babu&quot; class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities. In the 19th century, the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens. In 1883, Calcutta was host to the first national conference of the Indian National Association, which was the first avowed nationalist organisation in India.

The partition of Bengal in 1905 along religious lines led to mass protests, making Calcutta a less hospitable place for the British. The capital was moved to New Delhi in 1911. Calcutta continued to be a centre for revolutionary organisations associated with the Indian independence movement. The city and its port were bombed several times by the Japanese between 1942 and 1944, during World War II. Millions starved to death during the Bengal famine of 1943 (at the same time of the war) due to a combination of military, administrative, and natural factors. Demands for the creation of a Muslim state led in 1946 to an episode of communal violence that killed over 4,000. The partition of India led to further clashes and a demographic shift—many Muslims left for East Bengal (later East Pakistan, present day Bangladesh), while hundreds of thousands of Hindus fled into the city.

During the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Marxist–Maoist movement by groups known as the Naxalites damaged much of the city&#x27;s infrastructure, resulting in economic stagnation. During East Pakistan&#x27;s secessionist war of independence in 1971, the city was home to the government-in-exile of Bangladesh. During the war, refugees poured into West Bengal and strained Kolkata&#x27;s infrastructure. The Eastern Command of the Indian military, which is based in Fort William, played a pivotal role in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 and securing the surrender of Pakistan. During the mid-1980s, Mumbai (then called Bombay) overtook Kolkata as India&#x27;s most populous city. In 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi dubbed Kolkata a &quot;dying city&quot; in light of its socio-political woes. In the period 1977–2011, West Bengal was governed from Kolkata by the Left Front, which was dominated by the Communist Party of India (CPM). It was the world&#x27;s longest-serving democratically elected communist government, during which Kolkata was a key base for Indian communism. The city&#x27;s economic recovery gathered momentum after the 1990s, when India began to institute pro-market reforms. Since 2000, the information technology (IT) services sector has revitalised Kolkata&#x27;s stagnant economy. The city is also experiencing marked growth in its manufacturing base. In the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, Left Front was succeeded by the Trinamool Congress.

== Geography ==
Spread roughly meridionally along the east bank of the Hooghly River, Kolkata sits within the lower Ganges Delta of eastern India approximately 75 km (47 mi) west of the international border with Bangladesh; the city&#x27;s elevation is . Much of the city was originally a wetland that was reclaimed over the decades to accommodate a burgeoning population. The remaining undeveloped areas, known as the East Kolkata Wetlands, were designated a &quot;wetland of international importance&quot; by the Ramsar Convention (1975). As with most of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the soil and water are predominantly alluvial in origin. Kolkata is located over the &quot;Bengal basin&quot;, a pericratonic tertiary basin. Bengal basin comprises three structural units: shelf or platform in the west; central hinge or shelf/slope break; and deep basinal part in the east and southeast. Kolkata is located atop the western part of the hinge zone which is about wide at a depth of about below the surface. The shelf and hinge zones have many faults, among them some are active. Total thickness of sediment below Kolkata is nearly above the crystalline basement; of these the top is Quaternary, followed by of Tertiary sediments, trap wash of Cretaceous trap and Permian-Carboniferous Gondwana rocks. The quaternary sediments consist of clay, silt and several grades of sand and gravel. These sediments are sandwiched between two clay beds: the lower one at a depth of ; the upper one in thickness. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, on a scale ranging from in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes, the city lies inside seismic zone III.

=== Climate ===

Kolkata is subject to a tropical savanna climate that is designated &quot;Aw&quot; under the Köppen climate classification. According to a United Nations Development Programme report, its wind and cyclone zone is &quot;very high damage risk&quot;.

=== Environmental issues ===

Pollution is a major concern in Kolkata. , sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide annual concentration were within the national ambient air quality standards of India, but respirable suspended particulate matter levels were high, and on an increasing trend for five consecutive years, causing smog and haze. Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer.

== Cityscape and urban structure ==

Kolkata, which is under the jurisdiction of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), has an area of . The east–west dimension of the city is comparatively narrow, stretching from the Hooghly River in the west to roughly the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in the east—a span of . The north–south distance is greater, and its axis is used to section the city into North, Central, South and East Kolkata. North Kolkata is the oldest part of the city. Characterised by 19th-century architecture and narrow alleyways, it includes areas such as Jorasanko, Rajabazar, Maniktala, Ultadanga, Shyambazar, Shobhabazar, Bagbazar, Cossipore, Sinthee etc. The north suburban areas like Dum Dum, Baranagar, Belgharia, Sodepur, Khardaha, New Barrackpore, Madhyamgram, Barrackpore, Barasat etc. are also within the city of Kolkata (as a metropolitan structure).

Central Kolkata hosts the central business district. It contains B. B. D. Bagh, formerly known as Dalhousie Square, and the Esplanade on its east; Rajiv Gandhi Sarani is on its west. The West Bengal Secretariat, General Post Office, Reserve Bank of India, Calcutta High Court, Lalbazar Police Headquarters and several other government and private offices are located there. Another business hub is the area south of Park Street, which comprises thoroughfares such as Jawahar Lal Nehru Road, Abanindranath Thakur Sarani, Dr. Martin Luther King Sarani, Dr. Upendra Nath Brahmachari Sarani, Shakespeare Sarani and Acharay Jagadish Chandra Basu Road.
South Kolkata developed after India gained independence in 1947; it includes upscale neighbourhoods such as Bhowanipore, Alipore, Ballygunge, Kasba, Dhakuria, Santoshpur, Garia, Golf Green, Tollygunge, New Alipore, Behala, Barisha etc. The south suburban areas like Maheshtala, Budge Budge, Rajpur Sonarpur, Baruipur etc. are also within the city of Kolkata (as a metropolitan structure). The Maidan is a large open field in the heart of the city that has been called the &quot;lungs of Kolkata&quot; and accommodates sporting events and public meetings. The Victoria Memorial and Kolkata Race Course are located at the southern end of the Maidan. Among the other parks are Central Park in Bidhannagar and Millennium Park on Rajiv Gandhi Sarani, along the Hooghly River.

Two planned townships in the greater Kolkata region are Bidhannagar, also known as Salt Lake City and located north-east of the city; and Rajarhat, also called New Town and located east of Bidhannagar. In the 2000s, Sector 5 in Bidhannagar developed into a business hub for information technology and telecommunication companies. Both Bidhannagar and New Town are situated outside the Kolkata Municipal Corporation limits, in their own municipal corporations or authorities.

== Economy ==

Kolkata is the commercial and financial hub of East and Northeast India and home to the Calcutta Stock Exchange. It is a major commercial and military port, and is one of five cities in eastern India (alongside Bhubaneswar, Guwahati, Imphal, and Kushinagar) to have an international airport. Once India&#x27;s leading city, Kolkata experienced a steady economic decline in the decades following India&#x27;s independence due to steep population increases and a rise in militant trade-unionism, which included frequent strikes that were backed by left-wing parties. From the 1960s to the late 1990s, several factories were closed and businesses relocated. The lack of capital and resources added to the depressed state of the city&#x27;s economy and gave rise to an unwelcome sobriquet: the &quot;dying city&quot;. The city&#x27;s fortunes improved after the Indian economy was liberalised in the 1990s and changes in economic policy were enacted by the West Bengal state government. Recent estimates of the economy of Kolkata&#x27;s metropolitan area have ranged from $150 to $250 billion (PPP GDP), and have ranked it third-most productive metro area of India.

Flexible production has been the norm in Kolkata, which has an informal sector that employs more than 40% of the labour force. One unorganised group, roadside hawkers, generated business worth in 2005. , around 0.81% of the city&#x27;s workforce was employed in the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, mining, etc.); 15.49% worked in the secondary sector (industrial and manufacturing); and 83.69% worked in the tertiary sector (service industries). , the majority of households in slums were engaged in occupations belonging to the informal sector; 36.5% were involved in servicing the urban middle class (as maids, drivers, etc.) and 22.2% were casual labourers. About 34% of the available labour force in Kolkata slums were unemployed. According to one estimate, almost a quarter of the population live on less than per day.

Major manufacturing companies in the city are Alstom, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Fosroc, Videocon. As in many other Indian cities, information technology became a high-growth sector in Kolkata starting in the late 1990s; the city&#x27;s IT sector grew at 70% per annum—a rate that was twice the national average. The 2000s saw a surge of investments in the real estate, infrastructure, retail, and hospitality sectors; several large shopping malls and hotels were launched. Companies such as ITC Limited, CESC Limited, Exide Industries, Emami, Eveready Industries India, Lux Industries, Rupa Company, Berger Paints, Birla Corporation, Britannia Industries and Purushottam Publishers are headquartered in the city. Philips India, PwC India, Tata Global Beverages, and Tata Steel have their registered office and zonal headquarters in Kolkata. Kolkata hosts the headquarters of two major banks: UCO Bank, and Bandhan Bank. Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India have its eastern zonal office in Kolkata. India Government Mint, Kolkata is one of the four mints in India. Some of the oldest public sector companies are headquartered in the city such as the Coal India, National Insurance Company, Garden Reach Shipbuilders &amp; Engineers, Tea Board of India, Geological Survey of India, Zoological Survey of India, Botanical Survey of India, Jute Corporation of India, National Test House, Hindustan Copper and the Ordnance Factories Board of the Indian Ministry of Defence.

== Demographics ==
=== Population ===
The demonym for residents of Kolkata are &quot;Calcuttan&quot; and &quot;Kolkatan&quot;. According to provisional results of the 2011 national census, Kolkata district, which occupies an area of , had a population of 4,486,679; its population density was . This represents a decline of 1.88% during the decade 2001–11. The sex ratio is 899 females per 1000 males—lower than the national average. The ratio is depressed by the influx of working males from surrounding rural areas, from the rest of West Bengal; these men commonly leave their families behind. Kolkata&#x27;s literacy rate of 87.14% exceeds the national average of 74%. The final population totals of census 2011 stated the population of city as 4,496,694. The urban agglomeration had a population of 14,112,536 in 2011.

, about one-third of the population, or 15 lakh (1.5 million) people, lived in 3,500 unregistered squatter-occupied and 2,011 registered slums. The authorised slums (with access to basic services like water, latrines, trash removal by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation) can be broadly divided into two groups—&quot;bustees&quot;, in which slum dwellers have some long term tenancy agreement with the landowners; and &quot;udbastu colonies&quot;, settlements which had been leased to refugees from present-day Bangladesh by the government. The unauthorised slums (devoid of basic services provided by the municipality) are occupied by squatters who started living on encroached lands—mainly along canals, railway lines and roads. According to the 2005 National Family Health Survey, around 14% of the households in Kolkata were poor, while 33% lived in slums, indicating a substantial proportion of households in slum areas were better off economically than the bottom quarter of urban households in terms of wealth status. Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for founding and working with the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata—an organisation &quot;whose primary task was to love and care for those persons nobody was prepared to look after&quot;.

=== Language ===
 
Bengali, the official state language, is the dominant language in Kolkata. English is also used, particularly by the white-collar workforce. Hindi and Urdu are spoken by a sizeable minority. Bengali Hindus form the majority of Kolkata&#x27;s population; Marwaris, Biharis and Urdu-speaking Muslims compose large minorities. Among Kolkata&#x27;s smaller communities are Chinese, Tamils, Nepalis, Pathans/Afghans (locally known as &quot;Kabuliwala&quot;) Odias, Telugus, Gujaratis, Anglo-Indians, Armenians, Bengali Muslims, Greeks, Tibetans, Maharashtrians, Konkanis, Malayalees, Punjabis and Parsis. The number of Armenians, Greeks, Jews and other foreign-origin groups declined during the 20th century. The Jewish population of Kolkata was 5,000 during World War II, but declined after Indian independence and the establishment of Israel; , there were 25 Jews in the city. India&#x27;s sole Chinatown is in eastern Kolkata; once home to 20,000 ethnic Chinese, its population dropped to around 2,000, , as a result of multiple factors including repatriation and denial of Indian citizenship following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, and immigration to foreign countries for better economic opportunities. The Chinese community traditionally worked in the local tanning industry and ran Chinese restaurants.

=== Religion ===

According to the 2011 census, 76.51% of the population is Hindu, 20.60% Muslim, 0.88% Christian, 0.47% Jain, 0.31% Sikh and 0.11% Buddhist. 1.12% did not state a religion in the census. Kolkata reported 67.6% of Special and Local Laws crimes registered in 35 large Indian cities during 2004.

== Government and public services ==

=== Civic administration ===

Kolkata is administered by several government agencies. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation, or KMC, oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city&#x27;s 16 boroughs, which together encompass 144 wards. Each ward elects a councillor to the KMC. Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets. As Kolkata&#x27;s apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a mayor, a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC. The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation.

Kolkata&#x27;s administrative agencies have areas of jurisdiction that do not coincide. Listed in ascending order by area, they are: Kolkata district; the Kolkata Police area and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation area, or &quot;Kolkata city&quot;; and the Kolkata metropolitan area, which is the city&#x27;s urban agglomeration. The agency overseeing the latter, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority, is responsible for the statutory planning and development of greater Kolkata. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation was ranked first out of 21 cities for best governance and administrative practices in India in 2014. It scored 4.0 on 10 compared to the national average of 3.3.

The Kolkata Port Trust, an agency of the central government, manages the city&#x27;s river port. , the All India Trinamool Congress controls the KMC; the mayor is Firhad Hakim, while the deputy mayor is Atin Ghosh. The city has an apolitical titular post, that of the Sheriff of Kolkata, which presides over various city-related functions and conferences.

As the seat of the Government of West Bengal, Kolkata is home to not only the offices of the local governing agencies, but also the West Bengal Legislative Assembly; the state secretariat, which is housed in the Writers&#x27; Building; and the Calcutta High Court. Most government establishments and institutions are housed in the centre of the city in B. B. D. Bagh (formerly known as Dalhousie Square). The Calcutta High Court is the oldest High Court in India. It was preceded by the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William which was established in 1774. The Calcutta High Court has jurisdiction over the state of West Bengal and the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Kolkata has lower courts: the Court of Small Causes and the City Civil Court decide civil matters; the Sessions Court rules in criminal cases. The Kolkata Police, headed by a police commissioner, is overseen by the West Bengal Ministry of Home Affairs. The Kolkata district elects two representatives to India&#x27;s lower house, the Lok Sabha, and 11 representatives to the state legislative assembly. The Kolkata police district registered 15,510 Indian Penal Code cases in 2010, the 8th-highest total in the country. In 2010, the crime rate was 117.3 per 100,000, below the national rate of 187.6; it was the lowest rate among India&#x27;s largest cities.

=== Utility services ===

The Kolkata Municipal Corporation supplies the city with potable water that is sourced from the Hooghly River; most of it is treated and purified at the Palta pumping station located in North 24 Parganas district. Roughly 95% of the 4,000 tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in Dhapa, which is east of the town. To promote the recycling of garbage and sewer water, agriculture is encouraged on the dumping grounds. Parts of the city lack proper sewerage, leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal.

In 1856, the Bengal Government appointed George Turnbull to be the Commissioner of Drainage and Sewerage to improve the city&#x27;s sewerage. Turnbull&#x27;s main job was to be the Chief Engineer of the East Indian Railway Company responsible for building the first railway from Howrah to Varanasi (then Benares).

Ten medical and dental colleges are located in the Kolkata metropolitan area which act as tertiary referral hospitals in the state. The Calcutta Medical College, founded in 1835, was the first institution in Asia to teach modern medicine. However, these facilities are inadequate to meet the healthcare needs of the city. More than 78% in Kolkata prefer the private medical sector over the public medical sector, due to the overburdening of the public health sector, the lack of a nearby facility, and excessive waiting times at government facilities.

According to the Indian 2005 National Family Health Survey, only a small proportion of Kolkata households were covered under any health scheme or health insurance. The total fertility rate in Kolkata was 1.4, the lowest among the eight cities surveyed. In Kolkata, 77% of the married women used contraceptives, which was the highest among the cities surveyed, but use of modern contraceptive methods was the lowest (46%).

== Culture ==


Kolkata is known for its literary, artistic and revolutionary heritage; as the former capital of India, it was the birthplace of modern Indian literary and artistic thought. Kolkata has been called the &quot;City of Furious, Creative Energy&quot; as well as the &quot;cultural [or literary] capital of India&quot;. The presence of &quot;paras&quot;, which are neighbourhoods that possess a strong sense of community, is characteristic of the city. Typically, each &quot;para&quot; has its own community club and on occasion, a playing field. Residents engage in &quot;addas&quot;, or leisurely chats, that often take the form of freestyle intellectual conversation. The city has a tradition of political graffiti depicting everything from outrageous slander to witty banter and limericks, caricatures and propaganda.

Kolkata has many buildings adorned with Indo-Islamic and Indo-Saracenic architectural motifs. Several well-maintained major buildings from the colonial period have been declared &quot;heritage structures&quot;; others are in various stages of decay. Established in 1814 as the nation&#x27;s oldest museum, the Indian Museum houses large collections that showcase Indian natural history and Indian art. Marble Palace is a classic example of a European mansion that was built in the city. The Victoria Memorial, a place of interest in Kolkata, has a museum documenting the city&#x27;s history. The National Library of India is the leading public library in the country while Science City is the largest science centre in the Indian subcontinent.
The popularity of commercial theatres in the city has declined since the 1980s. Group theatres of Kolkata, a cultural movement that started in the 1940s contrasting with the then-popular commercial theatres, are theatres that are not professional or commercial, and are centres of various experiments in theme, content, and production; group theatres use the proscenium stage to highlight socially relevant messages. Chitpur locality of the city houses multiple production companies of &quot;jatra&quot;, a tradition of folk drama popular in rural Bengal. Kolkata is the home of the Bengali cinema industry, dubbed &quot;Tollywood&quot; for Tollygunj, where most of the state&#x27;s film studios are located. Its long tradition of art films includes globally acclaimed film directors such as Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha and contemporary directors such as Aparna Sen, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Goutam Ghose and Rituparno Ghosh.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Bengali literature was modernised through the works of authors such as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam and Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. Coupled with social reforms led by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Swami Vivekananda and others, this constituted a major part of the Bengal Renaissance. The middle and latter parts of the 20th century witnessed the arrival of post-modernism, as well as literary movements such as those espoused by the &quot;Kallol&quot; movement, hungryalists and the little magazines. Large majority of publishers of the city is concentrated in and around College Street, &quot;... a half-mile of bookshops and bookstalls spilling over onto the pavement&quot;, selling new and used books.

Kalighat painting originated in 19th century Kolkata as a local style that reflected a variety of themes including mythology and quotidian life. The Government College of Art and Craft, founded in 1864, has been the cradle as well as workplace of eminent artists including Abanindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy and Nandalal Bose. The art college was the birthplace of the Bengal school of art that arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the prevalent academic art styles in the early 20th century. The Academy of Fine Arts and other art galleries hold regular art exhibitions. The city is recognised for its appreciation of &quot;Rabindra Sangeet&quot; (songs written by Rabindranath Tagore) and Indian classical music, with important concerts and recitals, such as Dover Lane Music Conference, being held throughout the year; Bengali popular music, including &quot;baul&quot; folk ballads, &quot;kirtans&quot; and &quot;Gajan&quot; festival music; and modern music, including Bengali-language &quot;adhunik&quot; songs. Since the early 1990s, new genres have emerged, including one comprising alternative folk–rock Bengali bands. Another new style, &quot;jibonmukhi gaan&quot; (&quot;songs about life&quot;), is based on realism.
Key elements of Kolkata&#x27;s cuisine include rice and a fish curry known as &quot;machher jhol&quot;, which can be accompanied by desserts such as &quot;roshogolla&quot;, &quot;sandesh&quot;, and a sweet yoghurt known as &quot;mishti dohi&quot;. Bengal&#x27;s large repertoire of seafood dishes includes various preparations of &quot;ilish&quot;, a fish that is a favourite among Calcuttans. Street foods such as &quot;beguni&quot; (fried battered eggplant slices), &quot;kati&quot; roll (flatbread roll with vegetable or chicken, mutton or egg stuffing), &quot;phuchka&quot; (a deep-fried crêpe with tamarind sauce) and Indian Chinese cuisine from Chinatown are popular.
Though Bengali women traditionally wear the &quot;sari&quot;, the &quot;shalwar kameez&quot; and Western attire is gaining acceptance among younger women. Western-style dress has greater acceptance among men, although the traditional &quot;dhoti&quot; and &quot;kurta&quot; are seen during festivals. Durga Puja, held in September–October, is Kolkata&#x27;s most important and largest festival; it is an occasion for glamorous celebrations and artistic decorations.

Two clubs of the city - Mohun Bagan Super Giant and East Bengal FC compete in the Indian Super League (ISL). Football matches between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, called as the Kolkata Derby, witness large audience attendance and rivalry between patrons. The multi-use Salt Lake Stadium, also known as Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan, is India&#x27;s second largest stadium by seating capacity.

The Calcutta Cricket and Football Club is the second-oldest cricket club in the world.

As in the rest of India, cricket is popular in Kolkata and is played on various grounds throughout the city. Kolkata is home to Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Kolkata Knight Riders and also the Cricket Association of Bengal which regulates cricket in West Bengal and the Bengal cricket team. Tournaments, especially those involving cricket, football, badminton and carrom, are regularly organised here on an inter-locality or inter-club basis. The Maidan, a vast field that serves as the city&#x27;s largest park, hosts several minor football and cricket clubs and coaching institutes. Eden Gardens, which has a capacity of 80,000, , hosted the final match of the 1987 Cricket World Cup.

The Netaji Indoor Stadium served as host of the 1981 Asian Basketball Championship, where India&#x27;s national basketball team finished 5th, ahead of teams that belong to Asia&#x27;s basketball elite, such as Iran. The city has three 18-hole golf courses. The oldest is at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club, the first golf club built outside the United Kingdom. The other two are located at the Tollygunge Club and at Fort William. The Royal Calcutta Turf Club hosts horse racing and polo matches. The Calcutta Polo Club is considered the oldest extant polo club in the world. The Calcutta Racket Club is a squash and racquet club in Kolkata. It was founded in 1793, making it one of the oldest rackets clubs in the world, and the first in the Indian subcontinent. The Calcutta South Club is a venue for national and international tennis tournaments; it held the first grass-court national championship in 1946. In the period 2005–2007, Sunfeast Open, a tier-III tournament on the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association circuit, was held in the Netaji Indoor Stadium; it has since been discontinued.

The Calcutta Rowing Club hosts rowing heats and training events.

<text>Elizabeth of York (11 February 1466 – 11 February 1503) was Queen of England from her marriage to King Henry VII on 18 January 1486 until her death in 1503. She was the daughter of King Edward IV and his wife, Elizabeth Woodville, and her marriage to Henry VII followed his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field, which marked the end of the civil war known as the Wars of the Roses. 

Elizabeth&#x27;s younger brothers, the &quot;Princes in the Tower&quot;, mysteriously disappeared from the Tower of London shortly after their uncle Richard III seized the throne in 1483. Although the 1484 Act of Parliament &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; declared the marriage of her parents as invalid, Elizabeth and her sisters returned to court under Richard III, after spending ten months in sanctuary in Westminster Abbey. It was rumoured that Richard was plotting to marry Elizabeth. The final victory of the Lancastrian faction in the Wars of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster for the Yorkist princess. However, Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry Elizabeth before he arrived in England. This may well have contributed to the haemorrhaging of Yorkist support for Richard, and her future husband had &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; repealed when he took the throne.

Elizabeth seems to have played little part in politics, after coming to the throne. Her marriage appears to have been a successful and happy one, although her eldest son, Arthur, Prince of Wales, died aged 15 in 1502, and three other children died young. Her second and only surviving son became king of England as Henry VIII, while her daughters Margaret and Mary became the queens of Scotland and France respectively.

==Ancestry and early life==

=== Birth ===
Elizabeth of York was born at the Palace of Westminster as the eldest child of King Edward IV and his wife, Elizabeth Woodville. Her christening was celebrated at Westminster Abbey, sponsored by her grandmothers, Jacquetta of Luxembourg, Duchess of Bedford, and Cecily Neville, Duchess of York.

In 1469, aged three, she was briefly betrothed to George Neville, who was created the Duke of Bedford in anticipation of the marriage. His father, John later supported George&#x27;s uncle, the Earl of Warwick, in a rebellion against King Edward IV, and the betrothal was called off. In 1475, Louis XI agreed to the marriage of nine-year-old Elizabeth of York to his son Charles, the Dauphin of France. In 1482, however, Louis XI reneged on his promise. She was named a Lady of the Garter in 1477, at the age of eleven, along with her mother and her paternal aunt Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk.

=== Sister of King Edward V===
On 9 April 1483, Elizabeth&#x27;s father, King Edward IV, died unexpectedly. Her brother Edward, still a child, ascended the throne as Edward V, and her uncle, her father&#x27;s younger brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was appointed regent and protector of his young nephew. Gloucester took steps to isolate his nephews from their Woodville relations, including their own mother.

Gloucester acted quickly to intercept Edward V while the latter was travelling from Ludlow, where he had been living as Prince of Wales, to London to be crowned king. Edward V was placed in the royal residence of the Tower of London, ostensibly for his protection, while his uncle Anthony Woodville, and half-brother Richard Grey, who had both been escorting him, were arrested and sent to Pontefract Castle. Elizabeth Woodville fled with her younger son Richard and her daughters, taking sanctuary in Westminster Abbey. Gloucester asked Thomas Bourchier, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to take Richard with him, so that the boy could reside in the Tower and keep his brother Edward company. Elizabeth Woodville, under duress, eventually agreed.

Two months later, on 22 June 1483, Edward IV&#x27;s marriage was declared invalid. It was claimed that Edward IV had, at the time of his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, already been married to Lady Eleanor Butler. Parliament issued a bill, &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; (&quot;Royal Title&quot;), in support of this position. This measure legally bastardized the children of Edward IV, made them ineligible for the succession, and declared Gloucester the rightful king, with the right of succession reverting to the children of George, 1st Duke of Clarence, another late brother of Gloucester, who had been attainted in 1478. Elizabeth&#x27;s uncle, Anthony Woodville, and her half-brother Richard Grey, were executed on Gloucester&#x27;s orders on 25 June. Gloucester was crowned king as Richard III on 6 July 1483, and Edward and Richard disappeared soon afterwards. Rumours began to spread that they had been murdered, and these appear to have been increasingly widely credited, even though some undoubtedly emanated from overseas.

=== Niece of King Richard III===
According to Polydore Vergil, Elizabeth&#x27;s mother made an alliance with Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry Tudor, later King Henry VII, who presented himself as the closest claimant to the throne among the Lancastrian party. Although Henry Tudor was descended from King Edward III, his claim to the throne was weak, owing to Letters Patent of King Henry IV in 1407, which barred accession to the throne to any heirs of the legitimised offspring of Henry&#x27;s great-great-grandparents, John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford. Whether these Letters Patent had force of law is disputed. Furthermore, there were legitimate Lancastrian lines into the Royal Houses of Portugal and Castile. Whatever the merits of Henry&#x27;s claim, according to Vergil, his mother and Elizabeth Woodville agreed he should move to claim the throne and, once he had taken it, marry Elizabeth of York to boost his feeble claim. In December 1483, in the cathedral of Rennes, Henry Tudor swore an oath promising to marry her and began planning an invasion.

In March 1484, Elizabeth Woodville and her daughters were persuaded, according to the &quot;Crowland Chronicle&quot;, to withdraw from sanctuary under &quot;frequent intercessions and dire threats&quot;. Richard III additionally swore a public oath, promising that they would &quot;not suffer any manner hurt&quot; nor would he &quot;imprison [them] within the Tower of London or other prison&quot;. It was rumoured that Richard III intended to marry Elizabeth of York because his wife, Anne Neville, was dying and they had no surviving children. The &quot;Crowland Chronicle&quot; claimed that Richard III was forced to deny this unsavoury rumour. Soon after Anne Neville&#x27;s death, Richard III sent Elizabeth away from court to the Sheriff Hutton Castle and opened negotiations with King John II of Portugal to marry his sister, Joan, Princess of Portugal, and to have Elizabeth marry their cousin, the future King Manuel I of Portugal.

Henry Tudor and his army landed in Wales on 7 August 1485 and marched inland. On 22 August, Henry Tudor and Richard III fought the Battle of Bosworth Field. Richard III had the larger army, but was betrayed by one of his most powerful nobles, William Stanley, and became the last English king to die in battle. Henry Tudor took the crown by right of conquest as Henry VII.

== Queen of England ==

=== Marriage to Henry VII ===
Though initially slow to keep his promise, Henry VII acknowledged the necessity of marrying Elizabeth of York to ensure the stability of his rule and weaken the claims of other surviving members of the House of York. It seems Henry wished to be seen as ruling in his own right, having claimed the throne by right of conquest and not by his marriage to the &quot;de facto&quot; heiress of the House of York. He had no intention of sharing power.

Henry VII had the Act of &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; repealed, thereby legitimising anew the children of Edward IV, and acknowledging Edward V as his predecessor. Though Richard III was regarded as a usurper, his reign was not ignored. Henry and Elizabeth required a papal dispensation to wed because of Canon Law frowning upon affinity: Henry and Elizabeth were descended from, respectively, John of Gaunt and his younger brother Edmund in the 4th degree, an issue that had caused much dispute and bloodshed as to which claim was superior. Two applications were sent, the first more locally, and the second one was slow in reaching Rome and slow to return with the response of the Pope. Ultimately, however, the marriage was approved by papal bull of Pope Innocent VIII dated March 1486 (one month after the wedding) stating that the Pope and his advisors &quot;Approveth confirmyth and stablishyth the matrimonye and coniuncion made betwene our sou[er]ayn lord King Henre the seuenth of the house of Lancastre of that one party And the noble Princesse Elyzabeth of the house of Yorke.&quot;

Because the journey to Rome and back took many months, and because Henry as king wanted to be certain that nobody could claim that his wedding to Elizabeth was unlawful or sinful, the more local application was obeyed first—it was sent to the papal legate for England and Scotland, which returned in January 1486. Cardinal Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated at the wedding of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York on 18 January 1486. Their first son, Arthur, was born on 20 September 1486, eight months after their marriage. Elizabeth of York was crowned queen on 25 November 1487. She gave birth to several more children, but only four survived infancy: Arthur, Margaret, Henry and Mary.

=== Relationship with Henry Tudor ===
Despite their marriage being a political arrangement, records indicate both partners appear to have slowly fallen in love with each other. Thomas Penn, in his biography of Henry VII writes that &quot;[t]hough founded on pragmatism, Henry and Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage had nevertheless blossomed throughout the uncertainty and upheaval of the previous eighteen years. This was a marriage of &#x27;faithful love&#x27;, of mutual attraction, affection and respect, from which the king seems to have drawn great strength.&quot;

In order to maintain stability and peace after ending a civil war that had lasted 32 years, the new Tudor dynasty needed to put an end to the quarrelling Yorkist and Lancastrian families. Elizabeth&#x27;s sisters, Cecily and Anne of York, and her cousin, Margaret Pole, were married to Lancastrian men who were loyal to Henry. Similar strategies had been used before by Richard III of England, though in that case the &quot;Titulus Regius&quot; had marred the status of Elizabeth and all of her sisters as illegitimate, and Richard had no intention of making it difficult for the two sides of the conflict to return to factionalism when two were married into one – his actions showed he was more interested in loyalty and eliminating rival claims by wedding them off to the inconsequential. Richard did this directly to Elizabeth&#x27;s sister, Cecily, by wedding her to Richard Scrope. Elizabeth, therefore, had a motive to see to the successful welfare of her female relatives, but by no means could she foresee whether it would guarantee peace at last.

Further complicating things is that the public image of Henry Tudor, handed down through time only accords with the last years of his reign. Where, when, and how he spent his money is traceable by surviving documents, some written by the king himself and many more having his signature &quot;Henry R&quot; to indicate his oversight of entries, both his personal and the realm&#x27;s finances, documented in careful detail. Surviving in the British National Archives are letters written by Elizabeth of York and also a records of her privy purse, supplying evidence that the rumour regarding Henry&#x27;s mistreatment of his wife could be false. Elizabeth was a very pious woman and one of her life passions was charity, one of the three theological virtues of the Catholic Church. She gave away money and alms in very large quantities, to the point she indebted herself on many occasions. She also gave generously to monks and religious orders. 

The records state that Elsyng Palace was one of two nurseries for Henry and Elizabeth&#x27;s children and they are both places where Elizabeth spent much of her time when not at court. Within a year of the Battle of Bosworth, a friend of Henry Tudor, Thomas Lovell, began expanding and improving upon the Elsyng property to make it fit for Elizabeth, her husband, and her children-to-be, completed by the time of the birth of Prince Henry with inner and outer courts and ample places to play for the royal children. This was largely done as a gift, but it was completed in the newer Renaissance style and in time was suitable enough for Henry and Elizabeth&#x27;s grandchildren and proves it was a much loved refuge for the king and his wife.

Elizabeth received a grand coronation where she was carried on a royal barge down the Thames. Henry VII was as much a builder as his son and granddaughter and Elizabeth had a hand in designing the new Greenwich Palace. The rebuilding at Greenwich commenced in 1498. In 1502, the master mason Robert Vertue was paid for working to a plan described as the &quot;new platt of Greenwich which was devised by the Queen&quot;. The Palace was well appointed for large scale entertaining. Records are very clear that Christmas was a raucous and special time for the royal family on the whole, evidenced by many surviving documents depicting a particularly lively court having a marvelous time, with copious amounts of imported wine, great amounts of money spent upon roasted meats, and entertainers. Henry also frequently bought gifts for Elizabeth and their children. The account books, kept by Henry, demonstrate that he spent a great deal of gold on expensive cloth for himself, his wife and his children.

Elizabeth of York did not exercise much political influence as queen due to her strong-minded mother-in-law Lady Margaret Beaufort. Elizabeth was reported to be gentle, kind and generous to her relations, servants and benefactors. One report does state that Henry VII chose to appoint Elizabeth&#x27;s choice for a vacant bishopric over his mother&#x27;s choice, showing Henry&#x27;s affection for, and willingness to listen to, Elizabeth. She seems to have had a love of books, patronising the English printer William Caxton. Elizabeth of York enjoyed music, dancing, and gambling; the last of these was a pastime she shared with her husband. She also kept greyhounds.

As queen, Elizabeth made arrangements for the education of her younger children, including the future Henry VIII. She also accompanied her husband on his diplomatic visit to Calais in 1500 to meet with Philip I of Castile. She corresponded with Queen Isabella I of Castile before their children&#x27;s marriage.

On 14 November 1501, Elizabeth of York&#x27;s 15-year-old son Arthur married Catherine of Aragon, daughter of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. The pair were sent to Ludlow Castle, the traditional residence of the Prince of Wales. Arthur died in April 1502. The news of Arthur&#x27;s death caused Henry VII to break down in grief, as much in fear for his dynasty as in mourning for his son. Elizabeth comforted him, telling him that he was the only child of his mother but had survived to become king, that God had left him with a son and two daughters, and that they were both young enough to have more children. When she returned to her own chambers, however, Elizabeth herself broke down with grief. Her attendants sent for Henry who, in turn, comforted her.

== Death and aftermath ==

In 1502, Elizabeth of York became pregnant once more and spent her confinement period in the Tower of London. Her embroiderer Robynet made her a new rich bed with curtains decorated with clouds and roses. On 2 February 1503, she gave birth to a daughter, Katherine, who died a few days later. Succumbing to a postpartum infection, Elizabeth of York died on 11 February, her 37th birthday. Her family seems to have been devastated by her death and mourned her deeply. According to one biographer, the death of Elizabeth &quot;broke the heart&quot; of her husband and &quot;shattered him&quot;. Another account says that Henry Tudor &quot;privily departed to a solitary place and would no man should resort unto him&quot;. Within a little over two years, King Henry VII had lost his eldest son, his wife, his baby daughter, and found himself having to honour the Treaty of Perpetual Peace by sending his eldest daughter, Margaret, to Scotland.
In 2012, the &quot;Vaux Passional&quot;, an illuminated manuscript that was once the property of Henry VII, was rediscovered in the National Library of Wales. It depicts the aftermath of Elizabeth&#x27;s death vividly. Henry VII is shown receiving the book containing the manuscript in mourning robes with a doleful expression on his face. In the background, behind their father, are the late queen&#x27;s daughters, Mary and Margaret, in black veils. The red head of 11-year-old Prince Henry is shown weeping into the sheets of his mother&#x27;s empty bed.

Henry VII entertained thoughts of remarriage to renew the alliance with Spain—Joanna, Dowager Queen of Naples (daughter of Ferdinand I of Naples), Joanna, Queen of Castile (daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella), and Margaret, Dowager Duchess of Savoy (sister-in-law of Joanna of Castile), were all considered —but he died a widower in 1509. On each anniversary of her death, he decreed that a requiem mass be sung, the bells be tolled, and 100 candles be lit in her honour. Henry also continued to employ her minstrels each New Year.

Henry VII&#x27;s reputation for miserliness became worse after Elizabeth&#x27;s death.

He was buried with Elizabeth of York under their effigies in his Westminster Abbey chapel. Her tomb was opened in the 19th century and the wood casing of her lead coffin was found to have been removed to create space for the interment of her great-great-grandson James VI and I.

== Appearance and legacy ==
The symbol of the Tudor dynasty is the Tudor rose, which became a royal symbol for England upon Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage to Henry VII in 1486. Her White Rose of York is most commonly proper to her husband&#x27;s Red Rose of Lancaster and today, uncrowned, is still the floral emblem of England.

Henry VIII owned a version of her portrait, displayed with a silk curtain, described in his inventory as a &quot;table with the Picture of Quene Elizabeth with a Curten of yellowe &amp; white sarceonet paned togethers&quot;. Her portrait may have painted by Meynnart Wewyck. Pietro Torrigiano made bronze effigies of Elizabeth and Henry VII for their monument at Westminster Abbey. 

Elizabeth of York was renowned as a great beauty for her time, with regular features, tall in stature, and a fair complexion, inheriting many traits from her father and her mother Elizabeth Woodville, who was considered at one point the most beautiful woman in the British Isles. She inherited her father&#x27;s height as most women of her generation were considerably smaller than .

<doc id="47909" wikidata="Q193499" url="?curid=47909" title="Krishna River">
<text>The Krishna River in the Deccan plateau is the third-longest river in India, after the Ganga and Godavari. It is also the fourth-largest in terms of water inflows and river basin area in India, after the Ganges, Indus and Godavari. The river, also called Krishnaveni, is long and its length in Maharashtra is 282 kilometres. It is a major source of irrigation in the Indian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

==Course==
The Krishna River originates in the Western Ghats near Mahabaleshwar at an elevation of about , in the state of Maharashtra in central India. From Mahabaleshwar it flows to the town of Wai and continues east until it empties into the Bay of Bengal. The Krishna River passes through the Indian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. Over its length, it flows for in Maharashtra, in Karnataka and in Andhra Pradesh.

==Tributaries==
The Krishna River has 13 major tributaries. Its principal tributaries include the Ghataprabha River, Malaprabha River, Bhima River, Tungabhadra River and Musi River. The Tungabhadra River has a catchment area of and a length of . The Bhima River is the longest tributary of the Krishna River. It has a total length of and catchment area of .

Three tributaries, Panchganga, Warna and Yerla, meet the Krishna River near Sangli. Hindus consider these places holy. It is said that Dattatreya, one of the Hindu deities, spent some of his days at Audumber on the banks of the Krishna.
Kudalasangama (also written as Kudala Sangama) is located about from the Almatti Dam in Bagalkot district of Karnataka state. The Krishna and Malaprabha rivers merge here. The &quot;Aikya Mantapa&quot; or the holy &quot;Samādhi&quot; of Basavanna, the founder of the Lingayat Hindu sect along with Linga, which is believed to be self-born (&quot;Swayambhu&quot;), is here and the river flows east towards Srisailam (another pilgrim center) Andhra Pradesh.

Sangameswaram of Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh is a famous pilgrim center for Hindus where Tungabhadra and Bhavanasi rivers join the Krishna River. The Sangameswaram temple is now drowned in the Srisailam reservoir, and visible for devotees only during summer when the reservoir&#x27;s water level comes down.

==Krishna Basin==
The Krishna Basin extends over an area of which is nearly 8% of the total geographical area of the country. This large basin lies in the states of Karnataka (113,271 km2), Telangana, Andhra Pradesh (76,252 km2) and Maharashtra (69,425 km2). It is the fifth largest basin in India.

Most of this basin comprises rolling and undulating country, except for the western border, which is formed by an unbroken line of the Western Ghats. The important soil types found in the basin are black soils, red soils, laterite and lateritic soils, alluvium, mixed soils, red and black soils, and saline and alkaline soils.

An average annual surface water potential of 78.1 km3 has been assessed in this basin. Out of this, 58.0 km3 is utilizable water. Culturable area in the basin is about , which is 10.4% of the total cultivable area of the country. As the water availability in the Krishna River was becoming inadequate to meet the water demand, Godavari River is linked to the Krishna River by commissioning the Polavaram right bank canal with the help of Pattiseema lift scheme in the year 2015 to augment water availability to the Prakasam Barrage in Andhra Pradesh. The irrigation canals of Prakasam Barrage form part of National Waterway 4. The Krishna-Godavari delta known as &quot;Rice Granary of India.&quot;

==Mineral deposits==

==Flora and fauna==

Widespread area near to the Krishna River holds the rich flora and fauna. The last surviving Mangrove forests in the Krishna estuary have been declared as the Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary. The sanctuary is the home to the large number of resident and migratory birds. Fishing cats, otters, Estuarine crocodiles, spotted deer, sambar deer, blackbucks, snakes, lizards and jackals can also be spotted in the sanctuary. The sanctuary also supports rich vegetation with plants like Rhizophora, Avicennia, and Aegiceros. The following are few other wildlife sanctuaries located in the Krishna basin.

==Water outflows to the sea==
The yearly water outflows to the sea in a water year from 1 June 2003 to 31 May 2022 (19 years) are given below
==Interstate water sharing==

At present, the award of Bachawat tribunal dated 31 May 1976 is applicable for sharing the water available in the river among the riparian states. The Brijesh Kumar tribunal award given on 29 November 2013 was challenged by Andhra Pradesh in the Supreme Court and the case has been pending since then. The newly created state of Telangana also approached the Supreme Court demanding a fresh tribunal hearing to secure its water needs on equitable basis.

Even though the river does not flow through Tamil Nadu, the Telugu Ganga Project is a canal system that brings Krishna River water to that state&#x27;s capital city of Chennai with the agreement of all basin states.

==Places and temples==

This river is revered by Hindus as sacred. The river is also believed to remove all the sins of those who bathe in it. The centre of attraction is the Krishna Pushkaram fair which is held once in twelve years on the banks of the Krishna River. There are many pilgrimage places in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on the course of the river.
The first holy place on the river Krishna is at Wai, known for the Mahaganpati Mandir and Kashivishweshwar temple. It has seven ghats along the river. Temples like Dattadeva temple, which is revered by the people of Maharashtra, are located on the banks of Krishna at Narsobawadi, ankalkhop Audumbar near Sangli. Yadur is one of the important holy places in Karnataka which is located on the bank of Krishna. Veerabhadra temple is a famous temple. Many devotees visit this place from Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Also, located on the banks of the river Krishna is the Sangameshwar Shiva temple at Haripur. Some of the other temples are the Kanaka Durga Temple in Vijayawada, Ramling temple near Sangli, Mallikarjuna Jyotirlinga (Srisailam), Amareshwara Swamy Temple, Vedadri Narasimha Temple, Vadapalli temple in Nalgonda, Dattadeva temple, and Sangameshwara Shiva temples at Alampur and Gadwal in Telangana.

Bhilawadi town in Maharashtra has a large stone structure constructed across Krishna River bank, also known as Krishna Ghat. This structure also includes one large and one small temple constructed in the middle of the river. This structure is believed to be constructed in 1779.

==Bridges==
The Krishna River is spanned by several bridges along its course, some of which are listed below.
* Krishna Bridge, Wai, Maharashtra – This bridge was demolished in 2021 which was located in the Dharmpuri Peth area of the town of Wai, was one of the oldest bridges that were built by the British in India. It spans the Krishna over nine &quot;kamans&quot; (arches) and is made of black rock. The bridge serves as a flood mark (when the water rises to the level of the road on the bridge) for the &quot;Waikar&quot; people.
* Irwin Bridge, Sangli – This is one of the oldest, historic and largest bridges over the Krishna that were built by the British. The Irwin Bridge, which is built of reddish stone, has two passages where one can climb down to the river in the middle of its span to view the water.
* Ankali Bridge, Sangli Maharashtra – This bridge is major link between Sangli and Kolhapur districts. At this point there are three bridges, one for railway and two for roadways. Out of two roadway bridge the one bridge in the direction towards Miraj was built in Nineteenth century under British Administration. It is still in operation. The railway bridge was constructed at the time of laying of Kolhapur to Pune rail link. The contractor for rail bridge was V. R. Ranade &amp; Sons from Pune. The construction of this railway bridge and culverts on railway route in nearby region were constructed by them in 1882–1884.
* Kudachi – Ugar Railway bridge built by the British in 1891.
* B. Soundatti Bridge, Raibag – This is also one of the oldest bridges built during the British rule. This bridge connects Maharashtra to Karnataka state.
* Tangadagi Bridge, This is one of oldest bridges that connects the Bijapur and Bagalkot districts of Karnataka. God Neelambika Temple is there at the bank of Krishna River.
* Chikkapadasalagi bridge, is one of the oldest bridges, built in British era it connects Jamakhandi and Vijayapur.
* Jambagi Bridge, Jamkhandi : Recently built bridge connects Athani, Bijapur and Jamkhandi.
* Galagali Bridge of Galagali village, Bagalkot: very important bridge that connects many towns and villages of Bagalkot and Vijayapur districts.

* Krishna Bridge near Shakti Nagar, Raichur district was built in the memory of the travel undertaken by Nawab Javvadjaha Bahadur, the prince of Hyderabad, to Raichur in early 20th century. The bridge was named after the prince as Sirat-e-joodi. The construction began in 1933 and completed in 1943

In October 2009, heavy floods occurred, isolating 350 villages and leaving millions homeless, which is believed to be first occurrence in 1000 years. The flood resulted in heavy damage to Kurnool, Mahabubnagar, Guntur, Krishna and Nalagonda Districts. The entire city of Kurnool was immersed in approximately water for nearly 3 days.

Water inflow of was recorded at the Prakasam Barriage, which surpassed the previous record of recorded in the year 1903. Krishna River is the second largest east flowing river of the peninsula. The flood waters of Krishna and Godavari rivers can be fully utilized by exporting water to other east flowing peninsular rivers up to Vaigai River in Tamil Nadu by constructing a coastal reservoir on the Bay of Bengal sea area.

==Dams==


There are many dams constructed across the Krishna River.

* Dhom Dam
* Hippargi barrage
* Almatti Dam
* Narayanpur Dam
* Bhima Dam
* Jurala Dam
* Srisailam Dam
* Nagarjuna Sagar Dam
* Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond
* Pulichinthala Dam
* Prakasam Barrage
* Tungabhadra Dam
* Rajolibanda barrage
* Sunkesula barrage
==Hydroelectric power stations==
The Krishna River is one of the rivers whose water energy is harnessed to a large extent by various hydro electric power stations in India. The following is the list of hydro electric power stations excluding small and medium installations.


==Pollution==
Most of the years, the river water is not joining the sea due to full utilisation of water mainly in agriculture. Closed river basin of Krishna means that the river ecosystem is on the verge of death. The river receives the waste from the large number of cities and the river basin population has increased to 80 million enhancing pollution load many folds into the river. Adequate average and minimum continuous environmental flows to the sea are not taking place in most of the years constricting salt export and leading to formation of saline and sodic alkaline soils in the lower reaches of the river basin. High alkalinity water is discharged from the ash dump areas of many coal fired power stations into the river which further increases the alkalinity of the river water whose water is naturally of high alkalinity since the river basin is draining vast area of basalt rock formations. The following are the few coal fired power stations located in the river basin

<text>The Jordan River or River Jordan (, &quot;Nahr al-ʾUrdunn&quot;; , &quot;Nəhar hayYardēn&quot;), also known as &quot;Nahr Al-Sharieat&quot; (), is a endorheic river in the Levant that flows roughly north to south through the Sea of Galilee and drains to the Dead Sea. The river passes by or through Jordan, Syria, Israel, and the Palestinian territories.

Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights border the river to the east, while Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank lie to its west. Both Jordan and the West Bank derive their names in relation to the river. The river holds major significance in Judaism and Christianity. According to the Bible, the Israelites crossed it into the Promised Land and Jesus of Nazareth was baptized by John the Baptist in it.

==Etymology==
Several hypotheses for the origin of most of the river&#x27;s names in modern languages (e.g., Jordan, Yarden, Urdunn), one is that it comes from Semitic &#x27;Yard|on&#x27; &#x27;flow down&#x27; &lt;√ירד reflecting the river&#x27;s declivity, possibly appearing also in other river names in the region such as Yarkon and Yarmouk, or it may be related to the Egyptian loanword &#x27;yǝʾor&#x27; (&#x27;big river&#x27;, the Nile). According to this hypothesis, &quot;Den&quot; might be linked to the Akkadian word dannum for &quot;powerful&quot;. Cognates of the word are found in Aramaic, Hebrew, Mandaic, and other Semitic languages. The first recorded use of the name appears as &quot;Yārdon&quot; in Anastasi I, an ancient Egyptian papyrus that probably dates to the time of Rameses II. Early Arab chronicles referred to the river as &quot;Al-Urdunn&quot;.

In Mandaic, the etymologically related term &quot;Yardena&quot; () can refer not only to the Jordan River, but also any other body of flowing water that can be used for Mandaean baptismal rituals (&quot;masbuta&quot;).

After the Crusades, the Arabic name &quot;Nahr Al Sharieat&quot; (), literally &quot;the watering place&quot; began to be used, and was recorded by medieval geographers such as Abu&#x27;l-Fida and Al-Dimashqi. The name was shown in various forms on most notable 19th century maps of the region and is described by Edward Robinson in his &quot;Biblical Researches in Palestine&quot;. Although historical sources do not appear to make this distinction, it is described in some modern sources as the name for the part of the river before it flows into the Sea of Galilee.

The Dan and Hasbani rivers merge near the kibbutz Sde Nehemia in northern Israel and become the Jordan river. The Hasbani (Arabic: الحاصباني &quot;Hasbani&quot;, Hebrew: either שניר &quot;Snir&quot; or &quot;Hatzbani&quot;) is a stream which flows from the north-western foot of Mount Hermon in Lebanon, with a flow of 118 million m3 annually. The Iyyon (Hebrew: עיון &quot;Iyyon&quot;, Arabic name: Ajoun stream, but دردره &quot;Dardara&quot; for the uppermost course and براغيث &quot;Bareighith&quot; or &quot;Beregeith&quot; for the rest of its course) is a stream which flows from Merj &#x27;Ayun area in southern Lebanon into the Hasbani.

The Dan (Arabic: اللدان &quot;Leddan&quot; or &quot;Liddan&quot;, Hebrew: דן &quot;Dan&quot;) is the largest among the Jordan&#x27;s upper course tributaries with c. 240-252 million cubic metres per year. The Banias (Arabic: بانياس &quot;Banias&quot;, Hebrew: either &quot;Banias&quot; or חרמון &quot;Hermon&quot;) is a stream arising from a spring at Banias at the foot of Mount Hermon, with a flow of 106 million m3 annually. It flows into the Dan along with the Nahal Sion or Nahal Assal (Hebrew) / Wadi el-&#x27;Asl or Assal (Arabic).

=== Upper course (Hula Valley) ===

The Jordan River has an upper course from its sources to the Sea of Galilee (via the Bethsaida Valley) and a lower course south of the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea. In traditional terminology, the upper course (or most of it) is commonly referred to as passing through the &quot;Hula Valley&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Upper Jordan Valley&quot;; the Sea of Galilee through which the river passes is a separate entity, and the term Jordan Valley is reserved for the lower course.

Over its upper course (fed by the Hasbani River, Banias River, Dan River, and the Iyyon Stream), the river drops rapidly in a run to the once large and swampy Lake Hula, which is slightly above sea level. Exiting the now much-diminished lake, it goes through an even steeper drop over the down to the Sea of Galilee, which it enters at its northern end. The Jordan deposits much of the silt it is carrying within the lake, which it leaves again near its southern tip at Degania Dam. 

Its section north of the Sea of Galilee is within the boundaries of Israel and forms the western boundary of the Golan Heights. South of the lake, it forms the border between the Kingdom of Jordan (to the east), and Israel (to the west).

===Lower course===
South of the Sea of Galilee, the river is situated about 210 metres below sea level. The last section follows what is commonly termed the &quot;Jordan Valley&quot;, which has less gradient (the total drop is another 210 metres) so that the river meanders before entering the Dead Sea, a terminal lake about 422 metres below sea level with no outlet. The river is fed by two major tributaries, the Yarmouk and Zarqa. The Yarmouk, the largest tributary of the lower course, forms the border between Syria and Jordan and then Jordan and Israel.

==History==
In the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by Christopher Costigan in 1835, Thomas Howard Molyneux in 1847, William Francis Lynch in 1848, and John MacGregor in 1869. The full text of W. F. Lynch&#x27;s 1849 book &quot;&quot; is available online.
In 1964, Israel began operating a pumping station that diverts water from the Sea of Galilee to the National Water Carrier. Also in 1964, Jordan constructed a channel that diverted water from the Yarmouk to the East Ghor Canal. Syria has also built reservoirs that catch the Yarmouk&#x27;s waters. Environmentalists blame Israel, Jordan and Syria for extensive damage to the Jordan River ecosystem.

== Environment ==

=== Ecology ===
The Jordan River basin has a unique ichthyofauna as it serves as the meeting point for several different biogeographic regions, including the northern Palearctic, the Afrotropics, East &amp; South Asia, and the Mediterranean. Native fish include cyprinids such as the Jordan bream (&quot;Achanthobrama lissneri&quot;), Jordan himri (&quot;Carasobarbus canis&quot;), Jordan barbel (&quot;Luciobarbus longiceps&quot;), Levantine scraper (&quot;Capoeta damascina&quot;; the most common native fish in the basin), red garra (&quot;Garra rufa&quot;), &amp; Damascus garra (&quot;Garra nana&quot;), hillstream loaches such as the Palestine loach (&quot;Oxynoemacheilus insignis&quot;), catfish such as the African sharptooth catfish (&quot;Clarias gariepinus&quot;), cichlids such as the blue tilapia (&quot;Oreochromis aureus&quot;), redbelly tilapia (&quot;Coptodon zillii&quot;), &amp; mango tilapia (&quot;Sarotherodon galilaeus&quot;), and blennies such as the freshwater blenny (&quot;Salariopsis fluviatilis&quot;). The Jordan bream and Jordan barbel are thought to be endemic to the Jordan River basin. The Jordan basin may have also served as the center of diversification for several now-widespread Palearctic fish groups.

A native freshwater reptile is the Balkan terrapin (&quot;Mauremys rivulata&quot;), which is thought to have also been a food source for the earliest Neanderthal residents of the region.

Several introduced species of fish are known from the region, including common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;), grass carp (&quot;Ctenopharyngodon idella&quot;), black carp (&quot;Hypophthalmichthys molitrix&quot;), rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;), Nile tilapia (&quot;Oreochromis niloticus&quot;), and sea mullet (&quot;Mugil cephalus&quot;). Many of these introduced fish either prey on or outcompete native fish and threaten their populations, especially the more endangered species.

=== Flow ===
In modern times, up to 95% of the water is diverted for human purposes, and the flow is less than 10% of the past average. Because of this and the high evaporation rate of the Dead Sea, as well as industrial extraction of salts through evaporation ponds, the Dead Sea is rapidly shrinking. The flow rate of the Jordan River once was 1.3 billion cubic metres per year; as of 2010, just 20 to 30 million cubic metres per year flow into the Dead Sea.

=== Pollution ===
A small section of the northernmost portion of the Lower Jordan, the first ca. below the Sea of Galilee, has been kept pristine for baptism and local tourism. Most polluted is the 100-kilometre downstream stretch—a meandering stream from above the confluence with the Yarmouk to the Dead Sea. Environmentalists say the practice of letting sewage and brackish water flow into the river has almost destroyed its ecosystem. Rescuing the Jordan could take decades, according to environmentalists. In 2007, FoEME named the Jordan River as one of the world&#x27;s 100 most endangered ecological sites, due in part to lack of cooperation between Israel and neighboring Arab states.

== Roads, border crossings, bridges ==
===Roads===
Route 90, part of which is named after Rehavam Zeevi, connects the northern and southern tips of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and parallels the Jordan River on the western side.

===Border crossings (open bridges)===
There are two border crossings between Israel and Jordan which cross the river over bridges. The northern one, Jordan River Crossing or Sheikh Hussein Bridge is near Beit She&#x27;an; the southern one, Allenby Bridge (also King Hussein Bridge), is near Jericho.

===Bridges (historical; modern: open and closed)===
North to south:
* Daughters of Jacob Bridge (Hebrew: Gesher Bnot Ya&#x27;akov, &quot;Daughters of Jacob Bridge&quot;) is the most famous one within Israel
* Arik Bridge at the northern end of the Sea of Galilee; allows access to the central Golan Heights, was crucial in the 1967 and 1973 wars
* Al-Sinnabra, at the spot where the river used to exit the Sea of Galilee in the past; few remains excavated by archaeologists
* Jisr el-Majami&#x27; north of Beit She&#x27;an/Beisan; closed
* Damiya or Adam Bridge halfway between Jericho and Beit She&#x27;an; closed
* King Abdullah Bridge south of the Allenby Bridge; closed.

==Importance as a water source==
Until the first decade of the 21st century, the waters of the Jordan River had been the largest water resource for Israel; lately, desalinated sea water from the Mediterranean has taken over this role. Israel&#x27;s National Water Carrier, completed in 1964, has delivered water from the Sea of Galilee to the Israeli coastal plain for over four decades, until prolonged drought led to abandoning this solution in favour of desalination.

Jordan receives of water from the river, a quantity which is regulated by the 1994 peace treaty with Israel. In the past, one of the main water resources in Jordan was the Jordan River, with a flow of 1.3 billion m3 per year (BCM/yr). However, after Israel built the National Water Carrier in 1953 and diverted water from the Sea of Galilee to Israel&#x27;s coastal plains and southern desert, the flow of the Lower Jordan River dropped significantly. The 50 MCM/yr that Israel provides from the Sea of Galilee as part of the 1994 peace treaty was meant to compensate for this loss. A 2010 study found that the Lower Jordan River has been reduced to 2% of its historic flow. Water quality has also deteriorated sharply, with high levels of salinity and pollution from agricultural fertilizer and untreated wastewater upstream in Israel and the West Bank.

Conflict about the waters of the Jordan River was a contributing factor to the Six-Day War when, starting in 1965, Syria attempted to divert some of its headwaters in collaboration with Lebanon and Jordan. The diversion works would have reduced the water availability for Israel&#x27;s carrier by about 35%, and Israel&#x27;s overall water supply by about 11%.

==Religious significance==

===Hebrew Bible===
In the Hebrew Bible the Jordan is referred to as the source of fertility of a large plain (&quot;Kikkar ha-Yarden&quot;), said to be watered like &quot;the garden of the LORD&quot; (Genesis ). There is no regular description of the Jordan in the Bible; only scattered and indefinite references to it are given. Jacob crossed it and its tributary, the Jabbok (the modern Zarqa River), on his way back from Haran (, ). It is noted as the line of demarcation between the &quot;two tribes and the half tribe&quot; settled to the east (Numbers ) and the &quot;nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh&quot; that settled to the west (, passim).

Opposite Jericho, it is called &quot;the Jordan of Jericho&quot; (; ). The Jordan has a number of fords, and one of them is famous as the place where many Ephraimites were slain by Jephthah (Judges ). It seems that these are the same fords mentioned as being near Beth-barah, where Gideon lay in wait for the Midianites (). In the plain of the Jordan, between Succoth and Zarthan, is the clay ground where Solomon had his bronze foundries (1 Kings ). In the Jordan valley is portrayed as a woodland region. Biblical commentator Albert Barnes suggests that &quot;trees were rare in most parts of Palestine, but plentiful in the Jordan Valley&quot;.

In biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several miracles, the first taking place when the Jordan, near Jericho, was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua (Joshua 3:15-17). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as &quot;a witness&quot; between them and the other tribes (, , et seq.). The Jordan was crossed by Elijah and Elisha on dry ground (, ). Elisha performed two miracles at the Jordan: he healed Naaman&#x27;s leprosy by having him bathe in its waters (), and he made an axe head lost by one of the &quot;children of the prophets&quot; float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water ().

===New Testament===
The New Testament states that John the Baptist baptised unto repentance in the Jordan (Matthew 3:5–6; Mark; Luke ; John). These acts of baptism are also reported as having taken place at Bethabara (). Jesus came to be baptised by him there (Matthew 3:13; ; , ). The Jordan is also where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the Son of God and Lamb of God (). The prophecy of Isaiah regarding the Messiah which names the Jordan () is reported in .

The New Testament speaks several times about Jesus crossing the Jordan during his ministry (; ) and of believers crossing the Jordan to come hear him preach and to be healed of their diseases (; ). When his enemies sought to capture him, Jesus took refuge at the river in the place John had first baptised ().

Scholars have concluded that the site called Al-Maghtas on the east side has long been considered the location for the Baptism of Jesus and a place of pilgrimage. This has led to choosing Al-Maghtas as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2015.

===Derived cultural significance===
====Symbolism====
Because, according to Jewish tradition, the Israelites made a difficult and hazardous journey from slavery in Egypt to freedom in the Promised Land, the Jordan can refer to freedom. The actual crossing is the final step of the journey, which is then complete.

Among many other references, the Jordan River is given this meaning in the text of &quot;Old Man River&quot;: &quot;Let me go &#x27;way from the Mississippi / Let me go &#x27;way from the white man boss / Show me that stream called the River Jordan / That&#x27;s the old stream that I long to cross&quot;.

====Christening of royals====
Because of the baptism of Jesus, water from the Jordan is employed for the christening of heirs and princes in several Christian royal houses, such as the cases of Prince George of Wales, Simeon of Bulgaria and James Ogilvy. Earlier, On 15 May 1717, the Empress Maria Theresa was baptised in Vienna by the Papal Nuntius Giorgio Spinola, representing Pope Clement XI, with baptismal water containing a few drops from the River Jordan.

====Christian poetry and music====
The Jordan is a frequent symbol in folk, gospel, and spiritual music, and in poetic and literary works. The baptism of Jesus is referred to in a hymn by the reformer Martin Luther, &quot;&quot; (1541), base for a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach, (1724).

The Jordan River, due primarily to its rich spiritual importance, has provided inspiration for countless songs, hymns, and stories, including the traditional African-American spiritual/folk songs &quot;Michael Row the Boat Ashore&quot;, &quot;Deep River&quot;, and &quot;Roll, Jordan, Roll&quot;. It is mentioned in the songs &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;, &quot;Will You Be There&quot;, and &quot;The Wayfaring Stranger&quot; and in &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; from the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;. &quot;The Far Side Banks of Jordan&quot; by Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash on June&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning studio album, &quot;Press On&quot;, mentions the Jordan River as well as the Promised Land. Jordan River is the subject of roots reggae artist Burning Spear&#x27;s song of the same title. Belarusian band Spasenie dedicated its whole album &quot;Crossing the Jordan&quot; to the topic.

<text>The Hudson River is a river that flows from north to south primarily through eastern New York, United States. It originates in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York at Henderson Lake in the town of Newcomb, and flows southward through the Hudson Valley to the New York Harbor between New York City and Jersey City, eventually draining into the Atlantic Ocean at Upper New York Bay. The river serves as a physical boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York at its southern end. Farther north, it marks local boundaries between several New York counties. The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary, deeper than the body of water into which it flows, occupying the Hudson Fjord, an inlet that formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation, estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago. Even as far north as the city of Troy, the flow of the river changes direction with the tides.

The Hudson River runs through the Munsee, Lenape, Mohican, Mohawk, and Haudenosaunee homelands. Prior to European exploration, the river was known as the &quot;Mahicannittuk&quot; by the Mohicans, &quot;Ka&#x27;nón:no&quot; by the Mohawks, and &quot;Muhheakantuck&quot; by the Lenape. The river was subsequently named after Henry Hudson, an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company who explored it in 1609, and after whom Hudson Bay in Canada is also named. It had previously been observed by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailing for King Francis I of France in 1524, as he became the first European known to have entered the Upper New York Bay, but he considered the river to be an estuary. The Dutch called the river the &quot;North River&quot;, and they called the present-day Delaware River the &quot;South River&quot;, which formed the spine of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. Settlements of the colony clustered around the Hudson, and its strategic importance as the gateway to the American interior led to years of competition between the English and the Dutch over control of the river and colony.

During the 18th century, the river valley and its inhabitants were the subject and inspiration of Washington Irving, the first internationally acclaimed American author. In the nineteenth century, the area inspired the Hudson River School of landscape painting, an American pastoral style, as well as the concepts of environmentalism and wilderness. The Hudson River was also the eastern outlet for the Erie Canal, which, when completed in 1825, became an important transportation artery for the early 19th century United States.

Pollution in the Hudson River increased in the 20th century, more acutely by mid-century, particularly with industrial contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls, also known by their acronym PCBs. Pollution control regulations, enforcement actions and restoration projects initiated in the latter 20th century have begun to improve water quality, and restoration work has continued in the 21st century.

==Names==

The river was called &#x27; or &quot;Ca-ho-ha-ta-te-a&quot; (&quot;the river&quot;) by the Haudenosaunee, and it was known as &#x27; (&quot;river that flows two ways&quot; or &quot;waters that are never still&quot;) or &#x27; by the Mohican nation who formerly inhabited both banks of the lower portion of the river. The meaning of the Mohican name comes from the river&#x27;s long tidal range. The Delaware Tribe of Indians (Bartlesville, Oklahoma) considers the closely related Mohicans to be a part of the Lenape people, and so the Lenape also claim the Hudson as part of their ancestral territory, also calling it &#x27;.
The first known European name for the river was the Rio San Antonio as named by the Portuguese explorer in Spain&#x27;s employ, Estêvão Gomes, who explored the Mid-Atlantic coast in 1525. Another early name for the Hudson used by the Dutch was &quot;Rio de Montaigne&quot;. Later, they generally termed it the &quot;Noortrivier&quot;, or &quot;North River&quot;, the Delaware River being known as the &quot;Zuidrivier&quot;, or &quot;South River&quot;. Other occasional names for the Hudson included &quot;Manhattes rieviere&quot; &quot;Manhattan River&quot;, &quot;Groote Rivier&quot; &quot;Great River&quot;, and &quot;de grootte Mouritse reviere&quot;, or &quot;the Great Maurits River&quot; (after Maurice, Prince of Orange).

The translated name North River was used in the New York metropolitan area up until the early 1900s, with limited use continuing into the present day. The term persists in radio communication among commercial shipping traffic, especially below the Tappan Zee. The term also continues to be used in names of facilities in the river&#x27;s southern portion, such as the North River piers, North River Tunnels, and the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant. It is believed that the first use of the name Hudson River in a map was in a map created by the cartographer John Carwitham in 1740.
In 1939, the magazine &quot;Life&quot; described the river as &quot;America&#x27;s Rhine&quot;, comparing it to the Rhine in Central and Western Europe.

The tidal Hudson is unusually straight for a river, and the earliest colonial Dutch charts of the Hudson River designated the narrow, meandering stretches as &quot;racks&quot;, or reaches. These names included the four &quot;lower reaches&quot; through the Hudson Highlands (Seylmakers rack, Cocks rack, Hoogh rack, and Vosserack) plus the four &quot;upper reaches&quot; from Inbocht Bay to Kinderhook (Backers rack, Jan Pleysiers rack, Klevers rack, and Harts rack). A ninth reach was described as &quot;the long reach&quot; by the Englishman Robert Juet and designated as the Langerack by the Dutch. An embellished (and partly erroneous) list of &quot;The Old Reaches&quot; was published in a tourist guidebook for steamboat passengers in the nineteenth century.

=== Sources ===
The source of the Hudson River is Henderson Lake, located in the Adirondack Mountains at an elevation of . However, the photogenic Lake Tear of the Clouds is more conventionally cited in popular culture as the source of the Hudson. The river is named Feldspar Brook from where it emerges from Lake Tear of the Clouds until its confluence with the Opalescent River, after which it becomes the Opalescent until it reaches Calamity Brook flowing southward into the eastern outlet of Henderson Lake. After this point, the stream is known as the Hudson River according to the cartographical definition used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

USGS maps show the longest source of the Hudson as the Opalescent on the western slopes of Little Marcy Mountain, originating two miles north of Lake Tear of the Clouds.

===Upper Hudson River===
Using river names as seen on maps, Indian Pass Brook flows into Henderson Lake. The outlet of Henderson Lake is most commonly referred to as the official start of the Hudson River, as it flows east and meets the southwest flowing Calamity Brook. The confluence of the two rivers however is where most maps begin to use the Hudson River name on a cartographical basis. South of the outlet of Sanford Lake, the Opalescent River flows into the Hudson.

The Hudson then flows south, taking in Beaver Brook and the outlet of Lake Harris. After its confluence with the Indian River, the Hudson forms the boundary between Essex and Hamilton counties. The Hudson flows entirely into Warren County in the hamlet of North River, and takes in the Schroon River at Warrensburg. Further south, the river forms the boundary between Warren and Saratoga Counties. The river then takes in the Sacandaga River from the Great Sacandaga Lake.

Shortly thereafter, the river leaves the Adirondack Park, flows under Interstate 87, and through Glens Falls, just south of Lake George although receiving no streamflow from the lake. It next goes through Hudson Falls. At this point the river forms the boundary between Washington and Saratoga Counties. Here the river has an elevation of . Just south in Fort Edward, the river reaches its confluence with the Champlain Canal, which historically provided boat traffic between New York City and Montreal and the rest of Eastern Canada via the Hudson, Lake Champlain and the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

Further south the Hudson takes in water from the Batten Kill River and Fish Creek near Schuylerville. The river then forms the boundary between Saratoga and Rensselaer counties. The river then enters the heart of the Capital District. It takes in water from the Hoosic River, which extends into Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter the river has its confluence with the Mohawk River, the largest tributary of the Hudson River, in Waterford. The river then reaches the Federal Dam in Troy, marking an impoundment of the river. At an elevation of , the bottom of the dam marks the beginning of the tidal influence in the Hudson as well as the beginning of the lower Hudson River.

===Lower Hudson River===

South of the Federal Dam, the Hudson River begins to widen considerably. The river enters the Hudson Valley, flowing along the west bank of Albany and the east bank of Rensselaer. Interstate 90 crosses the Hudson into Albany at this point in the river. The Hudson then leaves the Capital District, forming the boundary between Greene and Columbia Counties. It then meets its confluence with Schodack Creek, widening considerably at this point. After flowing by Hudson, the river forms the boundary between Ulster and Columbia Counties and Ulster and Dutchess Counties, passing Germantown and Kingston.

The Delaware and Hudson Canal meets the river at this point. The river then flows by Hyde Park, former residence of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and alongside the city of Poughkeepsie, flowing under the Walkway over the Hudson and the Mid-Hudson Bridge. Afterwards, the Hudson passes Wappingers Falls and takes in Wappinger Creek. The river then forms the boundary between Orange and Dutchess Counties. It flows between Newburgh and Beacon and under the Newburgh Beacon Bridge, taking in the Fishkill Creek.

In this area, between Gee&#x27;s Point at the US Military Academy and Constitution Island, an area known as &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot; marks the deepest part of the Hudson, at . Shortly thereafter, the river enters the Hudson Highlands between Putnam and Orange Counties, flowing between mountains such as Storm King Mountain, Breakneck Ridge, and Bear Mountain. The river narrows considerably here before flowing under the Bear Mountain Bridge, which connects Westchester and Rockland Counties.
Afterward, leaving the Hudson Highlands, the river enters Haverstraw Bay, the widest point of the river at wide. Shortly thereafter, the river forms the Tappan Zee and flows under the Tappan Zee Bridge, which carries the New York State Thruway between Tarrytown and Nyack in Westchester and Rockland Counties respectively. At the state line with New Jersey the west bank of the Hudson enters Bergen County. The Palisades are large, rocky cliffs along the west bank of the river; also known as Bergen Hill at their lower end in Hudson County.

Further south the east bank of the river becomes Yonkers and then the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx in New York City. South of the confluence of the Hudson and Spuyten Duyvil Creek (subsumed by the Harlem River Ship Canal connecting to the Harlem River), the east bank of the river becomes Manhattan. The river is sometimes still called the North River from this point south. The George Washington Bridge crosses the river between Fort Lee and the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan.

The Lincoln Tunnel and the Holland Tunnel also cross under the river between Manhattan and New Jersey. South of the Battery, the river proper ends, meeting the East River to form Upper New York Bay, also known as New York Harbor. Its outflow continues through the Narrows between Brooklyn and Staten Island, under the Verrazzano Bridge, and into Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean through the Hudson Canyon.

==Geography and watershed==
The lower Hudson is a tidal estuary, with tidal influence extending as far as the Federal Dam in Troy. There are about two high tides and two low tides per day. As the tide rises, the tidal current moves northward, taking enough time that part of the river can be at high tide while another part can be at the bottom of its low tide.

Strong tides make parts of New York Harbor difficult and dangerous to navigate. During the winter, ice floes may drift south or north, depending upon the tides. The Mahican name of the river represents its partially estuarine nature: &quot;muh-he-kun-ne-tuk&quot; means &quot;the river that flows both ways.&quot; Due to tidal influence from the ocean extending to Troy, NY, freshwater discharge is only about per second on average. The mean fresh water discharge at the river&#x27;s mouth in New York is approximately per second.

The Hudson River is long, with depths of for the stretch south of the Federal Dam, dredged to maintain the river as a shipping route. Some sections there are around 160 feet deep, and the deepest part of the Hudson, known as &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot; (between the US Military Academy and Constitution Island) has a depth of .

The Hudson and its tributaries, notably the Mohawk River, drain an area of , the Hudson River Watershed. It covers much of New York, as well as parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont.

Parts of the Hudson River form coves, such as Weehawken Cove in the towns of Hoboken and Weehawken in New Jersey.

The City of Poughkeepsie and several adjacent communities in the mid-Hudson valley, totalling about 100,000 people, rely on the river for their drinking water.

===Salinity===
New York Harbor, between the Narrows and the George Washington Bridge, has a mix of fresh and ocean water, mixed by wind and tides to create an increasing gradient of salinity from the river&#x27;s top to its bottom. This varies with season, weather, variation of water circulation, and other factors; snowmelt at winter&#x27;s end increases the freshwater flow downstream.

The of the river varies from the north in Poughkeepsie to the south at Battery Park in New York City, though it usually lies near Newburgh.

==Geology==

The Hudson is sometimes called, in geological terms, a drowned river. The rising sea levels after the retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation, the most recent ice age, have resulted in a marine incursion that drowned the coastal plain and brought salt water well above the mouth of the river. The deeply eroded old riverbed beyond the current shoreline, Hudson Canyon, is a rich fishing area. The former riverbed is clearly delineated beneath the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, extending to the edge of the continental shelf. As a result of the glaciation and the rising sea levels, the lower half of the river is now a tidal estuary that occupies the Hudson Fjord. The fjord is estimated to have formed between 26,000 and 13,300 years ago.

Along the river, the Palisades are of metamorphic basalt, or diabases, the Highlands are primarily granite and gneiss with intrusions, and from Beacon to Albany, shales and limestones, or mainly sedimentary rock.

The Narrows were most likely formed about 6,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. Previously, Staten Island and Long Island were connected, preventing the Hudson River from terminating via the Narrows. At that time, the Hudson River emptied into the Atlantic Ocean through a more westerly course through parts of present-day northern New Jersey, along the eastern side of the Watchung Mountains to Bound Brook, New Jersey and then on into the Atlantic Ocean via Raritan Bay. A buildup of water in the Upper New York Bay eventually allowed the Hudson River to break through previous land mass that was connecting Staten Island and Brooklyn to form the Narrows as it exists today. This allowed the Hudson River to find a shorter route to the Atlantic Ocean via its present course between New Jersey and New York City.

Suspended sediments, mainly consisting of clays eroded from glacial deposits and organic particles, can be found in abundance in the river. The Hudson has a relatively short history of erosion, so it does not have a large depositional plain near its mouth. This lack of significant deposits near the river mouth differs from most other American estuaries. Around New York Harbor, sediment also flows into the estuary from the ocean when the current is flowing north.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===
The area around Hudson River was inhabited by indigenous peoples ages before Europeans arrived. The Lenape, Wappinger, and Mahican branches of the Algonquians lived along the river, mostly in peace with the other groups. The Algonquians in the region mainly lived in small clans and villages throughout the area. One major settlement was called Navish, which was located at Croton Point, overlooking the Hudson River. Other settlements were located in various locations throughout the Hudson Highlands. Many villagers lived in various types of houses, which the Algonquians called wigwams, though large families often lived in longhouses that could be a hundred feet long.

At the associated villages, they grew corn, beans, and squash. They also gathered other types of plant foods, such as hickory nuts and many other wild fruits and tubers. In addition to agriculture, the Algonquians also fished in the Hudson River, focusing on various species of freshwater fish, as well as various variations of striped bass, American eels, sturgeon, herring, and shad. Oyster beds were also common on the river floor, which provided an extra source of nutrition. Land hunting consisted of turkey, deer, bear, and other animals.

The lower Hudson River was inhabited by the Lenape, while further north, the Wappingers lived from Manhattan Island up to Poughkeepsie. They traded with both the Lenape to the south and the Mahicans to the north. The Mahicans lived in the northern part of the valley from present-day Kingston to Lake Champlain, with their capital located near present-day Albany.

===Exploration and colonization===
John Cabot is credited for the Old World&#x27;s discovery of continental North America, with his journey in 1497 along the continent&#x27;s coast. In 1524, Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed north along the Atlantic seaboard and into New York Harbor, however he left the harbor shortly thereafter, without navigating into the Hudson River. In 1598, Dutch men employed by the Greenland Company wintered in New York Bay.

In 1609 the Dutch East India Company financed English navigator Henry Hudson in his search for the Northeast Passage, but thwarted by sea ice in that direction, he sailed westward across the Atlantic in pursuit of a Northwest Passage. During the search, Hudson sailed up the river that would later be named after him. He then sailed upriver to a point near Stuyvesant (Old Kinderhook), and the ship’s boat with five members ventured to the vicinity of present-day Albany, reaching an end to navigation.

The Dutch subsequently began to colonize the region, establishing the colony of New Netherland, including three major fur-trading outposts: New Amsterdam, Wiltwyck, and Fort Orange. New Amsterdam was founded at the mouth of the Hudson River, and would later become known as New York City. Wiltwyck was founded roughly halfway up the Hudson River, and would later become Kingston. Fort Orange was founded on the river north of Wiltwyck, and later became known as Albany.

The Dutch West India Company operated a monopoly on the region for roughly twenty years before other businessmen were allowed to set up their own ventures in the colony. In 1647, Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took over management of the colony, and surrendered it in 1664 to the British, who had invaded the largely-defenseless New Amsterdam. New Amsterdam and the colony of New Netherland were renamed New York, after the Duke of York.

Under British colonial rule, the Hudson Valley became an agricultural hub. Manors were developed on the east side of the river, and the west side contained many smaller and independent farms. In 1754, the Albany Plan of Union was created at Albany City Hall on the Hudson. The plan allowed the colonies to treaty with the Iroquois and provided a framework for the Continental Congress.

===American Revolution===
During the American Revolutionary War, the British realized that the river&#x27;s proximity to Lake George and Lake Champlain would allow their navy to control the water route from Montreal to New York City. British general John Burgoyne planned the Saratoga campaign, to control the river and therefore cut off the patriot hub of New England (to the river&#x27;s east) from the South and Mid-Atlantic regions to the river&#x27;s west. The action would allow the British to focus on rallying the support of loyalists in the southerly states. As a result, numerous battles were fought along the river and in nearby waterways. These include the Battle of Long Island, in August 1776 and the Battle of Harlem Heights the following month. Later that year, the British and Continental Armies were involved in skirmishes and battles in rivertowns of the Hudson in Westchester County, culminating in the Battle of White Plains.

Also in late 1776, New England militias fortified the river&#x27;s choke point known as the Hudson Highlands, which included building Fort Clinton and Fort Montgomery on either side of the Hudson and a metal chain between the two. In 1777, Washington expected the British would attempt to control the Hudson River, however they instead conquered Philadelphia, and left a smaller force in New York City, with permission to strike the Hudson Valley at any time. The British attacked on October 5, 1777, in the Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery by sailing up the Hudson River, looting the village of Peekskill and capturing the two forts. In 1778, the Continentals constructed the Great West Point Chain in order to prevent another British fleet from sailing up the Hudson.

===Hudson River School===
Hudson River School paintings reflect the themes of discovery, exploration, and settlement in America in the mid-19th century. The detailed and idealized paintings also typically depict a pastoral setting. The works often juxtapose peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness, which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley just as it was coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity. The school characterizes the artistic body, its New York location, its landscape subject matter, and often its subject, the Hudson River.

In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature in the form of the American landscape was an ineffable manifestation of God, though the artists varied in the depth of their religious conviction. Their reverence for America&#x27;s natural beauty was shared with contemporary American writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The artist Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School, his work first being reviewed in 1825, while painters Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were the most successful painters of the school.

===19th century===

At the beginning of the 19th century, transportation from the US east coast into the mainland was difficult. Ships were the fastest vehicles at the time, as trains were still being developed and automobiles were roughly a century away. In order to facilitate shipping throughout the country&#x27;s interior, numerous canals were constructed between internal bodies of water in the 1800s. One of the most significant canals of this era was the Erie Canal. The canal was built to link the Midwest to the Port of New York, a significant seaport during that time, by way of the Great Lakes, the canal, the Mohawk River, and the Hudson River.

The completion of the canal enhanced the development of the American West, allowing settlers to travel west, send goods to markets in frontier cities, and export goods via the Hudson River and New York City. The completion of the canal made New York City one of the most vital ports in the nation, surpassing the Port of Philadelphia and ports in Massachusetts. After the completion of the Erie Canal, smaller canals were built to connect it with the new system. The Champlain Canal was built to connect the Hudson River near Troy to the southern end of Lake Champlain. This canal allowed boaters to travel from the St. Lawrence Seaway, and then British cities such as Montreal to the Hudson River and New York City.

Another major canal was the Oswego Canal, which connected the Erie Canal to Oswego and Lake Ontario, and could be used to bypass Niagara Falls. The Cayuga-Seneca Canal connected the Erie Canal to Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake. Farther south, the Delaware and Hudson Canal was built between the Delaware River at Honesdale, Pennsylvania, and the Hudson River at Kingston, New York. This canal enabled the transportation of coal, and later other goods as well, between the Delaware and Hudson River watersheds. The combination of these canals made the Hudson River one of the most vital waterways for trade in the nation.

During the Industrial Revolution, the Hudson River became a major location for production, especially around Albany and Troy. The river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast. Hundreds of factories were built around the Hudson, in towns including Poughkeepise, Newburgh, Kingston, and Hudson. The North Tarrytown Assembly (later owned by General Motors), on the river in Sleepy Hollow, was a large and notable example. The River links to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes, allowing manufacturing in the Midwest, including automobiles in Detroit, to use the river for transport. With industrialization came new technologies for transport, including steamboats for faster transport. In 1807, the &quot;North River Steamboat&quot; (later known as Clermont), became the first commercially successful steamboat. It carried passengers between New York City and Albany along the Hudson River.

The Hudson River valley also proved to be a good area for railroads. The Hudson River Railroad was established in 1849 on the east side of the river as a way to bring passengers from New York City to Albany. The line was built as an alternative to the New York and Harlem Railroad for travel to Albany, and as a way to ease the concerns of cities along the river. The railroad was also used for commuting to New York City. Further north, the Livingston Avenue Bridge was opened in 1866 as a way to connect the Hudson River Railroad with the New York Central Railroad, which goes west to Buffalo. Smaller railroads existed north of this point. On the west side of the Hudson River, the West Shore Railroad opened to run passenger service from Weehawken, New Jersey to Albany, and then Buffalo. In 1889, the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge opened for rail service between Poughkeepsie and the west side of the river.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Starting in the 20th century, the technological requirements needed to build large crossings across the river were met. This was especially important by New York City, as the river is fairly wide at that point. In 1927, the Holland Tunnel opened between New Jersey and Lower Manhattan. The tunnel was the longest underwater tunnel in the world at the time, and used an advanced system to ventilate the tunnels and prevent the build-up of carbon monoxide. The original upper level of the George Washington Bridge and the first tube of the Lincoln Tunnel followed in the 1930s. Both crossings were later expanded to accommodate extra traffic: the Lincoln Tunnel in the 1940s and 1950s, and the George Washington Bridge in the 1960s. In 1955, the original Tappan Zee Bridge was built over one of the widest parts of the river, from Tarrytown to Nyack.

The late 20th century saw a decline in industrial production in the Hudson Valley. In 1993, IBM closed two of its plants, in East Fishkill and Kingston, due to the company&#x27;s loss of $16 billion over the previous three years. The plant in East Fishkill had 16,300 workers at its peak in 1984, and had opened in 1941 originally as part of the war effort. In 1996, the North Tarrytown plant of General Motors (GM) closed. In response to the plant closures, towns throughout the region sought to make the region attractive for technology companies. IBM maintained a mainframe unit at its Poughkeepsie plant, and newer housing and office developments were built near there as well. Commuting from Poughkeepsie to New York City also increased. Developers also looked to build on the property of the old GM plant.


Around the time of the last factories&#x27; closing, environmental efforts to clean up the river progressed. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ordered General Electric (GE), which had polluted a 200-mile stretch of the river, to remove PCBs from the site of its old factory in Hudson Falls, as well as to remove millions of cubic yards of contaminated sediment from the river bottom. EPA&#x27;s cleanup order was issued pursuant to the agency&#x27;s designation of the polluted segment of the river as a Superfund site. Other conservation efforts also occurred, such as when Christopher Swain became the first person to swim all 315 miles of the Hudson River in support of cleaning it up.

In conjunction with conservation efforts, the Hudson River region has seen an economic revitalization, especially in favor of green development. In 2009, the High Line was opened in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. This linear park has views of the river throughout its length. Also in 2009, the original Poughkeepsie railroad bridge, since abandoned, was converted into the Walkway Over the Hudson, a pedestrian park over the river. Emblematic of the increase in green development in the region, waterfront parks in cities like Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and Beacon were built, and several festivals are held annually.

==Landmarks==

Numerous places have been constructed along the Hudson that have since become landmarks. Following the river from its source to mouth, there is the Hudson River Islands State Park in Greene and Columbia counties, and in Dutchess County, there is Bard College, Staatsburgh, the Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site, Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s home and presidential library, and the main campus of the Culinary Institute of America, Marist College, the Walkway over the Hudson, Bannerman&#x27;s Castle, and Hudson Highlands State Park. South of that in Orange County is the United States Military Academy. In Westchester lies Indian Point Energy Center, Croton Point Park, and Sing Sing Correctional Facility.

In New Jersey is Stevens Institute of Technology and Liberty State Park. In Manhattan is Fort Tryon Park with the Cloisters, and the World Trade Center. Ellis Island, partially belonging to both the states of New Jersey and New York, is located just south of the river&#x27;s mouth in New York Harbor. The Statue of Liberty, located on Liberty Island, is located a bit further south of there.

==Landmark status and protection==

A stretch on the east bank of the Hudson has been designated the Hudson River Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission protects the Palisades on the west bank of the river. The Hudson River was designated as an American Heritage River in 1997. The Hudson River estuary system is part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System as the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve.

==Transportation and crossings==
The Hudson River is navigable by large steamers up to Troy, and by ocean-faring vessels to the Port of Albany. The original Erie Canal, opened in 1825 to connect the Hudson with Lake Erie, emptied into the Hudson at the Albany Basin, just south of the Federal Dam in Troy (at mile 134). The canal enabled shipping between cities on the Great Lakes and Europe via the Atlantic Ocean. The New York State Canal System, the successor to the Erie Canal, runs into the Hudson River north of Troy. It also uses the Federal Dam as a lock.

Along the east side of the river runs the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, from Manhattan to Poughkeepsie. The tracks continue north of Poughkeepsie as Amtrak trains run further north to Albany. On the west side of the river, CSX Transportation operates a freight rail line between North Bergen Yard in North Bergen, New Jersey and Selkirk Yard in Selkirk, New York.

The Hudson is crossed at numerous points by bridges, tunnels, and ferries. The width of the Lower Hudson River required major feats of engineering to cross; the results are today visible in the George Washington Bridge and the 1955 Tappan Zee Bridge (replaced by the New Tappan Zee Bridge) as well as the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels and the PATH and Pennsylvania Railroad tubes. The George Washington Bridge, which carries multiple highways, connects Fort Lee, New Jersey to the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, and is the world&#x27;s busiest motor vehicle bridge.

The new Tappan Zee Bridge is the longest in New York, although the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge has a larger main span. The Troy Union Bridge between Waterford and Troy was the first bridge over the Hudson; built in 1804 and destroyed in 1909; its replacement, the Troy–Waterford Bridge, was built in 1909. The Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad was chartered in 1832 and opened in 1835, including the Green Island Bridge, the second bridge over the Hudson south of the Federal Dam.

The Hudson River Day Line offered passenger service on steamboats from New York City to Albany from 1863 until 1962 when it was purchased by Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises.

==Pollution==
The Hudson River&#x27;s sediments contain a significant array of pollutants, accumulated over decades from industrial waste discharges, sewage treatment plants, and urban runoff. Water quality in the river has greatly improved since implementation of the 1972 Clean Water Act (CWA). A 2020 report on the health of the river states that &quot;Water quality in the Hudson River Estuary has improved dramatically since 1972 and has remained largely stable in recent years.&quot; Ecological health trends, such as in tributaries and wetlands, are varied in condition. The concentrations of toxic pollutants in fish and crabs are lower compared to measurements taken in previous decades, but fishing restrictions and health warnings remain in effect.

The most significant pollution of the Hudson River was contamination of the river by General Electric (GE) with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) between 1947 and 1977. These chemicals caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who ate fish from the river. Other kinds of pollution, including mercury contamination and discharges of partially treated sewage, have also caused ecological problems in the river.

In response to the widespread contamination of the river, activists protested in various ways. A group of fishermen formed an organization in 1966 that would later become Riverkeeper, the first member of the Waterkeeper Alliance. Musician Pete Seeger founded the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and the Clearwater Festival to draw attention to the problem.

Environmental activism in New York and across the country, and increased attention from members of Congress led to passage of the CWA in 1972. Extensive remediation actions on the river began in the 1970s with the issuance and enforcement of CWA wastewater discharge permits and consequent control or reduction of discharges from industrial facilities and municipal sewage treatment plants.

In 1984, EPA declared a 200-mile (320 km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, as a Superfund site requiring cleanup, one of the largest such site designations in the country. Sediment removal operations by GE, pursuant to the Superfund orders, have continued into the 21st century.

==Flora and fauna==
===Plankton===
 Zooplankton are abundant throughout both fresh and saltwater portions of the river, and provide a crucial food source for larval and juvenile fish.

===Invertebrates===
The benthic zone has species capable of living in soft bottom habitats. Within freshwater regions, there are animal species including larvae of chironomid flies, oligochaete worms, predatory fly larvae, and amphipods. In saline regions, there are abundant polychaete annelids, amphipods, and some mollusks such as clams. These species burrow in the sediment and accelerate the breakdown of organic matter. Atlantic blue crabs are among the larger invertebrates, at the northern limit of their range.

The entire Hudson was once far more populated with native suspension-feeding bivalves. Freshwater mussels were common in the river&#x27;s limnetic zone, but populations have been decreasing for decades, probably from altered habitats and the invasive zebra mussel. Oyster beds were once pervasive in the saltwater portion, but are now reduced through pollution and exploitation.

===Fish===
About 220 species of fish, including 173 native species, currently are found in the Hudson River. Commercial fishing was once prominent in the river, although most were shut down in 1976 due to pollution; few survive today. American shad are the only finfish harvested for profit, though in limited numbers.

Species include striped bass, the most important game fish in the Hudson. Estimates of the striped bass population in the Hudson range to nearly 100 million fish. American eels also live in the river before reaching breeding age; for much of this stage they are known as glass eels because of the transparency of their bodies. The fish are the only catadromous species in the Hudson&#x27;s estuary.

The Atlantic tomcod is a unique species that adapted resistance to the toxic effects of the PCBs polluting the river. Scientists identified the genetic mutation that conferred the resistance, and found that the mutated form was present in 99 percent of the tomcods in the river, compared to fewer than 10 percent of the tomcods from other waters. The hogchoker flatfish have been historically abundant in the river, where farmers would use them for inexpensive livestock feed, giving the fish its name. Other unusual fish found in the river include the northern pipefish, the lined seahorse, and the northern puffer.

The Atlantic sturgeon, a species about 120 million years old, enter the estuary during their annual migrations. The fish grow to a considerable size, up to and . The fish are the symbol of the Hudson River Estuary. Their smoked flesh was commonly eaten in the river valley since 1779, and it was sometimes known as &quot;Albany beef&quot;. The city of Albany was called &quot;Sturgeondom&quot; or &quot;Sturgeontown&quot; in the 1850s and 1860s, with its residents known as &quot;Sturgeonites&quot;. The &quot;Sturgeondom&quot; name lost popularity around 1900. The fish have been off limits from fishing since 1998. The river&#x27;s population of shortnose sturgeon have quadrupled since the 1970s, and are also off limits to all fishing as they are a federally endangered species.

Lined seahorse or northern seahorse (&quot;Hippocampus erectus&quot;) are found in the brackish waters of the Lower New York Bay, New York Harbor and surrounding waters (including Raritan Bay and Sandy Hook Bay) and the Hudson River estuary.

===Marine and invasive species===
Marine life is known to exist in the estuary, with seals, crabs, and some whales reported. On March 29, 1647, a white whale swam up the river to the Rensselaerswyck (near Albany). Herman Melville, author of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, lived in and near Albany from 1830 to 1847, and was known to have ancestry from New Netherland, leading some to believe stories of the whale sighting inspired his novel.

Non-native species often originate in New York Harbor, a center of long-distance commerce. Over 100 foreign species reside in the river and its banks. Many of these have had significant effects on the ecosystem and natural habitats. The water chestnut produces a vegetative mat that reduces oxygen content in the water below, enhances sedimentation, impedes small vessel navigation, and is a hazard to swimmers and walkers. The zebra mussel arrived in the Hudson in 1989 and has spread through the river&#x27;s freshwater region, reducing photoplankton and river oxygen levels. Positively, the mussel clears suspended particles, allowing for more light to aquatic vegetation. In saltwater areas, the green crab spread in the early 20th century and the Japanese shore crab has become dominant in recent years.

===Habitats===
The Hudson has a diverse array of habitat types. Most of the river consists of deep water habitats, though its tidal wetlands of freshwater and salt marshes are among the most ecologically important. There is strong biological diversity, including intertidal vegetation like freshwater cattails and saltwater cordgrasses. Shallow coves and bays are often covered with submarine vegetation; shallower areas harbor diverse benthic fauna. Abundance of food varies over location and time, stemming from seasonal flows of nutrients. The Hudson&#x27;s large volume of suspended sediments reduces light penetration in the area&#x27;s water column, which reduces photoplankton photosynthesis and prevents sub-aquatic vegetation from growing beyond shallow depths. The oxygen-producing phytoplankton have also been inhibited by the relatively recent invasion of the zebra mussel species.

The Hudson River estuary is the site of wetlands from New York City all the way up to Troy. It has one of the largest concentrations of freshwater wetlands in the Northeast. Even though the river can be considered brackish further south, 80 percent of the wetlands are outside the influence of the saltwater coming from the Atlantic Ocean. Currently, the river has about acres of wetlands, and rising sea levels due to climate change are expected to lead to an expansion of that area. Wetlands are expected to migrate upland as sea level (and thus the level of the river) rises. This is different from the rest of the world, where rising sea levels usually leads to a reduction in wetland areas. The expansion of the wetlands are expected to provide more habitat to the fish and birds of the region.

==Activities==

Parkland surrounds much of the Hudson River; prominent parks include Battery Park and Liberty State Park at the river&#x27;s mouth, Riverside Park in Manhattan, Croton Point Park, Bear Mountain State Park, Storm King State Park and the Hudson Highlands, Moreau Lake State Park, and its source in the High Peaks Wilderness Area.

The New Tappan Zee Bridge between Westchester and Rockland counties has a pedestrian and bicycling path covering a distance of about 3.6 miles. Another pedestrian and bike path exists further north, between Dutchess and Ulster Counties: Walkway Over the Hudson, which has a one-way length of 1.2 miles.

Fishing is allowed in the river, although the state Department of Health recommends eating no fish caught from the South Glens Falls Dam to the Federal Dam at Troy. Women under 50 and children under 15 are not advised to eat any fish caught south of the Palmer Falls Dam in Corinth, while others are advised to eat anywhere from one to four meals per month of Hudson River fish, depending on species and location caught. The Department of Health cites mercury, PCBs, dioxin, and cadmium as the chemicals impacting fish in these areas.

Common native species recreationally fished include striped bass (formerly a major commercial species, now only legally taken by anglers), channel catfish, white catfish, brown bullhead, yellow perch, and white perch. The nonnative largemouth and smallmouth bass are also popular, and serve as the focus of catch-and-release fishing tournaments.

The Hudson River can be canoed and kayaked for its entire length from Henderson Lake (GPS 44.091974, -74.057768) to the Atlantic Ocean at New York City. The upper section includes the Hudson River Gorge, a spectacular 17-mile Class IV whitewater run. The Hudson River Greenway Water Trail runs for much of the river, from Saratoga County in the Adirondack Park to Battery Park in Manhattan.
