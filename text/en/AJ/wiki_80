<doc id="50279" wikidata="Q1144706" url="?curid=50279" title="List of prominent operas">
<text>Since the origins of opera in late 16th century Italy, a central repertoire has developed, shepherded by major opera composers. The earliest major opera composer is generally considered to be Claudio Monteverdi, who wrote the first prominent opera, &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, followed by two others. Throughout the later 17th century, his successor Francesco Cavalli and the Englishman Henry Purcell wrote numerous prominent operas. The early 18th century was dominated by the operas of George Frideric Handel, while other important works include Pepusch&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, Pergolesi&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;La serva padrona&quot;, and various works by Jean-Philippe Rameau.

This list provides a guide to the most prominent operas, as determined by their presence on a majority of selected compiled lists, which date from between 1984 and 2000. The operas included cover all important genres, and include all operas regularly performed today, from seventeenth-century works to late twentieth-century operas. The brief accompanying notes offer an explanation as to why each opera has been considered important. The organisation of the list is by year of first performance, or, if this was long after the composer&#x27;s death, approximate date of composition.

==1600–1699==

* 1607 &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (Claudio Monteverdi). Widely regarded as the first operatic masterwork.
* 1640 &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; (Monteverdi). Monteverdi&#x27;s first opera for Venice, based on Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, displays the composer&#x27;s mastery of portrayal of genuine individuals as opposed to stereotypes.
* 1642 &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; (Monteverdi). Monteverdi&#x27;s last opera, composed for a Venetian audience, is often performed today. Its Venetian context helps to explain the complete absence of the moralizing tone often associated with opera of this time.
* 1644 &quot;Ormindo&quot; (Francesco Cavalli). One of the first of Cavalli&#x27;s operas to be revived in the 20th century, &quot;Ormindo&quot; is considered one of his more attractive works.
* 1649 &quot;Giasone&quot; (Cavalli). In &quot;Giasone&quot; Cavalli, for the first time, separated aria and recitative. &quot;Giasone&quot; was the most popular opera of the 17th century.
* 1651 &quot;La Calisto&quot; (Cavalli). Ninth of the eleven operas that Cavalli wrote with Faustini is noted for its satire of the deities of classical mythology.
* 1683 &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; (Henry Purcell). Often considered to be the first genuine English-language operatic masterwork. Not first performed in 1689 at a girls&#x27; school, as is commonly believed, but at Charles II&#x27;s court in 1683.
* 1692 &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot; (Purcell). A semi-opera rather than a genuine opera, this is often thought to be Purcell&#x27;s finest dramatic work.
==1700–1749==

* 1710 &quot;Agrippina&quot; (Handel). Handel&#x27;s last opera that he composed in Italy was a great success, and established his reputation as a composer of Italian opera.
* 1711 &quot;Rinaldo&quot; (Handel). Handel&#x27;s first opera for the London stage was also the first all-Italian opera performed on the London stage.
* 1724 &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; (Handel). Noted for the richness of its orchestration.
* 1724 &quot;Tamerlano&quot; (Handel). Described by Anthony Hicks, writing in &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;, as possessing a &quot;taut dramatic power&quot;.
* 1725 &quot;Rodelinda&quot; (Handel). &quot;Rodelinda&quot; is often praised for the fullness of the melodic writing among Handel&#x27;s output.
* 1728 &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (Johann Christoph Pepusch). A satire of Italian &quot;opera seria&quot; based on a play by John Gay, the ballad opera format of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; has proved popular even up to the current time.
* 1731 &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; (Handel). Handel&#x27;s only work for the theatre that is set to an English libretto.
* 1733 &quot;Orlando&quot; (Handel). An opera that is described by Anthony Hicks as &quot;remarkable&quot; and by Orrey as one of Handel&#x27;s &quot;best works&quot;.
* 1733 &quot;La serva padrona&quot; (Giovanni Battista Pergolesi). Became a model for many of the &quot;opera buffas&quot; that followed it, including those of Mozart.
* 1733 &quot;Hippolyte et Aricie&quot; (Jean-Philippe Rameau). Rameau&#x27;s first opera caused great controversy at its premiere.
* 1735 &quot;Ariodante&quot; (Handel). Both this opera and &quot;Alcina&quot; enjoy high critical reputations today.
* 1735 &quot;Alcina&quot; (Handel). Both this work and &quot;Ariodante&quot; were part of Handel&#x27;s first opera season at Covent Garden.
* 1735 &quot;Les Indes galantes&quot; (Rameau). In this work Rameau added emotional depth and power to the traditionally lighter form of &quot;opéra-ballet&quot;.
* 1737 &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot; (Rameau). Initially only a moderate success, when it was revived in 1754 &quot;Castor et Pollux&quot; was regarded as Rameau&#x27;s finest achievement.
* 1738 &quot;Serse&quot; (Handel). Deviation from the usual model of &quot;opera seria&quot;, &quot;Serse&quot; contains many comic elements rare in Handel&#x27;s other works.
* 1740 &quot;Alfred&quot; (Thomas Arne). An English opera of all times, famous for the patriotic song &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;. 
* 1744 &quot;Semele&quot; (Handel). Originally performed as an oratorio, Semele&#x27;s dramatic qualities have often led to the work being performed on the opera stage in modern times.
* 1745 &quot;Platée&quot; (Rameau). Rameau&#x27;s most famous comic opera. Originally a court entertainment, a 1754 revival proved extremely popular with French audiences.

==1750–1799==

* 1760 &quot;La buona figliuola&quot; (Niccolò Piccinni). Piccinni&#x27;s work was initially immensely popular throughout Europe. By 1790 over 70 productions of the opera had been produced and it had been performed in all the major European cities.

Another &quot;Singspiel&quot; with much spoken dialogue taken from plays of that time, the plot of &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot; features two sopranos vying to become &quot;prima donna&quot; in a newly assembled company. Premiered together with Antonio Salieri&#x27;s &quot;Prima la musica e poi le parole&quot;
* 1786 &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (Mozart). The first of the famous series of Mozart operas set to libretti by Lorenzo Da Ponte is now Mozart&#x27;s most popular opera.
* 1787 &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (Mozart). Second of the operas that Mozart set to Da Ponte&#x27;s libretti, Don Giovanni has provided a puzzle for writers and philosophers ever since its composition.
* 1790 &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (Mozart). Third and last of the operas that Mozart set to libretti by Da Ponte, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; was scarcely performed throughout the 19th century, as the plot was considered to be immoral.
* 1791 &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; (Mozart). Mozart&#x27;s last opera before his early death was extremely popular until 1830, after which the work&#x27;s popularity and critical reputation began to decline; they did not return to their former levels until after the Second World War.
* 1791 &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (Mozart). Has been described as &quot;the apotheosis of the &quot;Singspiel&quot;&quot;, &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; was denigrated during the 19th century as confused and lacking in definition.
* 1792 &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot; (Domenico Cimarosa). Usually regarded as Cimarosa&#x27;s best opera, Leopold II enjoyed the three-hour-long premiere so much that, after dinner, he compelled the singers to repeat the opera later during that same day.
* 1797 &quot;Médée&quot; (Luigi Cherubini). Only French opera of the Revolutionary period to be regularly performed today. A famous showcase for sopranos such as Maria Callas.

* 1807 &quot;La vestale&quot; (Gaspare Spontini). Spontini&#x27;s opera about a vestal virgin in love was a great influence on Berlioz and a forerunner of French grand opera.
* 1812 &quot;La scala di seta&quot; (Gioachino Rossini). An early Rossini work, this opera is outright &quot;farsa comica&quot;.
* 1813 &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot; (Rossini). This opera is described by Richard Osborne, writing in Grove Music Online, as &quot;Rossini&#x27;s first &quot;buffo&quot; masterpiece in the fully fledged two-act form&quot;.
* 1813 &quot;Tancredi&quot; (Rossini). This &quot;melodramma eroico&quot; was described by poet Giuseppe Carpani thus: &quot;It is and always cantilena: beautiful cantilena, new cantilena, magic cantilena, rare cantilena&quot;.
* 1814 &quot;Il turco in Italia&quot; (Rossini). This opera stands out among Rossini&#x27;s output for its frequent ensembles and absence of aria.

* 1816 &quot;Otello&quot; (Rossini). The composer Giacomo Meyerbeer described the third act of &quot;Otello&quot; thus: &quot;The third act of Otello established its reputation so firmly that a thousand errors could not shake it&quot;.

* 1827 &quot;Il pirata&quot; (Vincenzo Bellini). Bellini&#x27;s second professional production established his international reputation.
* 1828 &quot;Der Vampyr&quot; (Heinrich Marschner). Marschner was a key link between Weber and Wagner, as this Gothic opera shows.
* 1828 &quot;Le comte Ory&quot; (Rossini). Rossini&#x27;s opera has enjoyed a high critical reputation throughout the years: 19th-century critic Henry Chorley said that &quot;there is not a bad melody, there is not an ugly bar in &quot;Le comte Ory&quot;&quot;, and Richard Osborne, writing in Grove Music Online, calls details that the work is one of the &quot;wittiest, most stylish and most urbane of all comic operas&quot;.
* 1829 &quot;La straniera&quot; (Bellini). &quot;La straniera&quot; is rare among &quot;bel canto&quot; operas in that it offers remarkably few opportunities for vocal ostentation.
* 1829 &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; (Rossini). Rossini&#x27;s last opera before his retirement is a tale of liberty set in the Swiss Alps. It helped to establish the genre of French Grand Opera.

* 1830 &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; (Daniel Auber). One of the most popular &quot;opéra comiques&quot; of the 19th century, Auber&#x27;s tale loosely based on an important Neapolitan rebel leader even inspired a film by Laurel and Hardy.

* 1831 &quot;La sonnambula&quot; (Bellini). The concertato &quot;D&#x27;un pensiero e d&#x27;un accento&quot; from the finale of Act 1 of this work was later parodied by Arthur Sullivan in &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;.

* 1836 &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; (Mikhail Glinka). Glinka established the tradition of Russian opera with this historical work and the later &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot;.
* 1836 &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; (Giacomo Meyerbeer). Perhaps the most famous of all French grand operas, widely regarded as Meyerbeer&#x27;s masterpiece.
* 1837 &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; (Donizetti). Donizetti wrote this work as a distraction from the grief he felt at the death of his wife.
* 1838 &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; (Hector Berlioz). Berlioz&#x27;s first opera is a virtuoso score which is still highly difficult to perform.

* 1840 &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot; (Verdi). Verdi&#x27;s only comedy apart from his last opera, &quot;Falstaff&quot;.
* 1842 &quot;Der Wildschütz&quot; (Albert Lortzing). Lortzing&#x27;s &quot;comic masterpiece&quot;, intended to show a German work could rival Italian &quot;opera buffa&quot; and French &quot;opéra comique&quot;.

* 1846 &quot;Attila&quot; (Verdi). Verdi was troubled by ill health during the writing of this piece, which was only a moderate success at the premiere.
* 1846 &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot; (Berlioz). Frustrated at his lack of opera commissions, Berlioz composed this &quot;dramatic legend&quot; for concert performance. In recent years, it has been successfully staged as an opera, though the critic David Cairns describes it as &quot;cinematic&quot;.
* 1847 &quot;Macbeth&quot; (Verdi). Verdi&#x27;s first venture into Shakespeare.
* 1847 &quot;Martha&quot; (Friedrich von Flotow). Flotow unashamedly aimed at satisfying popular taste in this comic and sentimental work set in the England of Queen Anne.

* 1849 &quot;Le prophète&quot; (Meyerbeer). A grand opera about the life of the religious fanatic, John of Leiden.
* 1849 &quot;Luisa Miller&quot; (Verdi). Fans of Verdi think that this setting of Schiller&#x27;s &quot;bourgeois tragedy&quot; has been underrated.

==1850–1875==

* 1850 &quot;Genoveva&quot; (Robert Schumann). Schumann&#x27;s only excursion into opera was a relative failure, though the work has had its admirers from Franz Liszt to Nikolaus Harnoncourt.

* 1850 &quot;Stiffelio&quot; (Giuseppe Verdi). Verdi&#x27;s tale of adultery among members of a German Protestant sect fell foul of the censors.

* 1853 &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (Verdi). This Romantic melodrama is one of Verdi&#x27;s most tuneful scores.
* 1853 &quot;La traviata&quot; (Verdi). The role of Violetta, the &quot;fallen woman&quot; of the title, is one of the most famous vehicles for the soprano voice.

* 1858 &quot;Der Barbier von Bagdad&quot; (Peter Cornelius). An oriental comedy drawing on the tradition of German Romantic opera.

* 1859 &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (Verdi). This opera ran into trouble with the censors because it originally dealt with the assassination of a monarch.
* 1861 &quot;Bánk bán&quot; (Erkel). Erkel&#x27;s third opera is considered the Hungarian &quot;National opera&quot;.
* 1862 &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; (Berlioz). The last opera Berlioz wrote is the final fruit of his lifelong admiration for Shakespeare.
* 1862 &quot;La forza del destino&quot; (Verdi). This tragedy was commissioned by the Imperial Theatre, Saint Petersburg, and Verdi may have been influenced by the Russian tradition in the writing of his work.
* 1863 &quot;Les pêcheurs de perles&quot; (Georges Bizet). Though a relative failure at its premiere, this is Bizet&#x27;s second most performed opera today and is particularly famous for its tenor/baritone duet.
* 1864 &quot;La belle Hélène&quot; (Offenbach). Another operetta by Offenbach which pokes fun at Greek mythology.
* 1864 &quot;Mireille&quot; (Gounod). Gounod&#x27;s work is based on the epic poem by Frédéric Mistral and makes use of Provençal folk tunes.
* 1865 &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; (Giacomo Meyerbeer). Meyerbeer&#x27;s last Grand Opera received a posthumous premiere.
* 1865 &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (Wagner). This romantic tragedy is Wagner&#x27;s most radical work and one of the most revolutionary pieces in music history. The &quot;Tristan chord&quot; began the breakdown of traditional tonality.
* 1866 &quot;Mignon&quot; (Ambroise Thomas). A lyrical work inspired by Goethe&#x27;s novel &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;, this was Thomas&#x27;s most successful opera along with &quot;Hamlet&quot;.
* 1866 &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; (Bedřich Smetana). Smetana&#x27;s folk comedy is the most widely performed of all his operas.
* 1867 &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (Verdi). Verdi&#x27;s French grand opera, after Schiller, is now one of his most highly regarded works.
* 1867 &quot;La jolie fille de Perth&quot; (Bizet). Bizet turned to a novel by Sir Walter Scott for this &quot;opéra comique&quot;.
* 1867 &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (Gounod). Gounod&#x27;s version of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy is his second most famous work.
* 1868 &quot;Dalibor&quot; (Smetana). One of the most successful of Smetana&#x27;s operas exploring themes from Czech history.
* 1868 &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; (Wagner). Wagner&#x27;s only comedy among his mature operas concerns the clash between artistic tradition and innovation.
* 1868 &quot;Hamlet&quot; (Thomas). Thomas&#x27;s opera takes many liberties with its Shakespearean source.
* 1868 &quot;La Périchole&quot; (Offenbach). Set in Peru, this operetta mixes comedy and sentimentality.
* 1868 &quot;Mefistofele&quot; (Arrigo Boito). Though most famous as a librettist for Verdi, Boito was also a composer and he spent many years working on this musical version of the Faust myth.
* 1869 &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; (Wagner). The &quot;preliminary evening&quot; to Wagner&#x27;s epic &quot;Ring&quot; cycle tells how the ring was forged and the curse laid upon it.
* 1870 &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (Wagner). The second part of the &quot;Ring&quot; tells the story of the mortals Siegmund and Sieglinde and of how the valkyrie Brünnhilde disobeys her father Wotan, king of the gods.
* 1871 &quot;Aida&quot; (Verdi). Features one of the greatest tenor arias of all time, &quot;Celeste Aida&quot;.

* 1984 &quot;Akhnaten&quot; (Philip Glass). Unlike his first opera &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, the writing and style are more conventional and lyrical and much of the music of &quot;Akhnaten&quot; is some of the most dissonant that Glass has composed.
* 1986 &quot;The Mask of Orpheus&quot; (Birtwistle). Birtwistle&#x27;s most ambitious opera examines the myth of Orpheus from several different angles.
* 1987 &quot;A Night at the Chinese Opera&quot; (Judith Weir). This piece is based on a Chinese play of the Yuan dynasty, &quot;The Orphan of Zhao&quot;.
* 1987 &quot;Nixon in China&quot; (John Adams). Musically minimalist in style, this opera recounts Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 meeting with Mao Zedong.
* 1991 &quot;Gawain&quot; (Birtwistle). Birtwistle&#x27;s opera is based on the medieval English poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;.
* 1995 &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (André Previn). The opera is based on the play by Tennessee Williams.

<doc id="50286" wikidata="Q183102" url="?curid=50286" title="Bugs Bunny">
<text>Bugs Bunny is a cartoon character created in the late 1930s at Warner Bros. Cartoons (originally Leon Schlesinger Productions) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc. Bugs is best known for his featured roles in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of animated short films, produced by Warner Bros. Earlier iterations of the character first appeared in Ben Hardaway&#x27;s &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hare Hunt&quot; (1938) and subsequent shorts before Bugs&#x27;s definitive characterization debuted in Tex Avery&#x27;s &quot;A Wild Hare&quot; (1940). Bob Givens, Chuck Jones, and Robert McKimson are credited for defining Bugs&#x27;s design.

Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray-and-white rabbit or hare who is characterized by his flippant, insouciant personality. He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster, and his catchphrase &quot;Eh... What&#x27;s up, doc?&quot;. Through his popularity during the golden age of American animation, Bugs became an American cultural icon and Warner Bros.&#x27; official mascot.

Bugs starred in more than 160 short films produced between 1940 and 1964. He has since appeared in feature films, television shows, comics, and other media. He has appeared in more films than any other cartoon character, is the ninth most-portrayed film personality in the world and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Development==
According to Chase Craig, who wrote and drew the first Bugs Bunny comic Sunday pages and the first Bugs comic book, &quot;Bugs was not the creation of any one man; however, he rather represented the creative talents of perhaps five or six directors and many cartoon writers including Charlie Thorson. In those days, the stories were often the work of a group who suggested various gags, bounced them around and finalized them in a joint story conference.&quot; A prototype Bugs rabbit with some of the personality of a finalized Bugs, though looking very different, was originally featured in the film &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hare Hunt&quot;, released on April 30, 1938. It was co-directed by Ben &quot;Bugs&quot; Hardaway and an uncredited director Cal Dalton (who was responsible for the initial design of the rabbit). This cartoon has an almost identical plot to Avery&#x27;s &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot; (1937), which had introduced Daffy Duck. Porky Pig is again cast as a hunter tracking a silly prey who is more interested in driving his pursuer insane and less interested in escaping. &quot;Hare Hunt&quot; replaces the little black duck with a small white rabbit. According to Friz Freleng, Hardaway and Dalton had decided to &quot;dress the duck in a rabbit suit&quot;. The white rabbit had an oval head and a shapeless body. In characterization, he was &quot;a rural buffoon&quot;. Mel Blanc gave the character a voice and laugh much like those he later used for Woody Woodpecker. He was loud, zany with a goofy, guttural laugh. The rabbit character was popular enough with audiences that the Termite Terrace staff decided to use it again.

The rabbit comes back in &quot;Prest-O Change-O&quot; (1939), directed by Chuck Jones, where he is the pet rabbit of unseen character Sham-Fu the Magician. Two dogs, fleeing the local dogcatcher, enter the rabbit&#x27;s absent master&#x27;s house. The rabbit harasses them but is ultimately bested by the bigger of the two dogs. This version of the rabbit was cool, graceful, and controlled. He retained the guttural laugh but was otherwise silent.

The rabbit&#x27;s third appearance comes in &quot;Hare-um Scare-um&quot; (1939), directed again by Dalton and Hardaway. This cartoon—the first in which he is depicted as a gray bunny instead of a white one—is also notable as the rabbit&#x27;s first singing role. Charlie Thorson, lead animator on the film, gave the character a name. He had written &quot;Bug&#x27;s Bunny&quot; on the model sheet that he drew for Hardaway. In promotional material for the cartoon, including a surviving 1939 presskit, the name on the model sheet was altered to become the rabbit&#x27;s own name: &quot;Bugs&quot; Bunny (quotation marks only used, on and off, until 1944).

In his autobiography, Blanc claimed that another proposed name for the character was &quot;Happy Rabbit.&quot; In the actual cartoons and publicity, however, the name &quot;Happy&quot; only seems to have been used in reference to Bugs Hardaway. In &quot;Hare-um Scare-um&quot;, a newspaper headline reads, &quot;Happy Hardaway.&quot; Animation historian David Gerstein disputes that &quot;Happy Rabbit&quot; was ever used as an official name, arguing that the only usage of the term came from Mel Blanc himself in humorous and fanciful tales he told about the character&#x27;s development in the 1970s and 1980s; the name &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; was used as early as August 1939, in the Motion Picture Herald, in a review for the short &quot;Hare-um Scare-um&quot;.

Thorson had been approached by Tedd Pierce, head of the story department, and asked to design a better look for the rabbit. The decision was influenced by Thorson&#x27;s experience in designing hares. He had designed Max Hare in &quot;Toby Tortoise Returns&quot; (Disney, 1936). For Hardaway, Thorson created the model sheet previously mentioned, with six different rabbit poses. Thorson&#x27;s model sheet is &quot;a comic rendition of the stereotypical fuzzy bunny&quot;. He had a pear-shaped body with a protruding rear end. His face was flat and had large expressive eyes. He had an exaggerated long neck, gloved hands with three fingers, oversized feet, and a &quot;smart aleck&quot; grin. The result was influenced by Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; tendency to draw animals in the style of cute infants. He had an obvious Disney influence, but looked like an awkward merger of the lean and streamlined Max Hare from &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot; (1935) and the round, soft bunnies from &quot;Little Hiawatha&quot; (1937).

In Jones&#x27; &quot;Elmer&#x27;s Candid Camera&quot; (1940), the rabbit first meets Elmer Fudd. This time the rabbit looks more like the present-day Bugs, taller and with a similar face—but retaining the more primitive voice. &quot;Candid Camera&quot;&#x27;s Elmer character design is also different: taller and chubbier in the face than the modern model, though Arthur Q. Bryan&#x27;s character voice is already established.

===Official debut===

While &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hare Hunt&quot; was the first Warner Bros. cartoon to feature what would become Bugs Bunny, &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;, directed by Tex Avery and released on July 27, 1940, is widely considered to be the first official Bugs Bunny cartoon. It is the first film where both Elmer Fudd and Bugs, both redesigned by Bob Givens, are shown in their fully developed forms as hunter and tormentor, respectively; the first in which Mel Blanc uses what became Bugs&#x27; standard voice; and the first in which Bugs uses his catchphrase, &quot;What&#x27;s up, Doc?&quot; &quot;A Wild Hare&quot; was a huge success in theaters and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Cartoon Short Subject.

For the film, Avery asked Givens to remodel the rabbit. The result had a closer resemblance to Max Hare. He had a more elongated body, stood more erect, and looked more poised. If Thorson&#x27;s rabbit looked like an infant, Givens&#x27; version looked like an adolescent. Blanc gave Bugs the voice of a city slicker. The rabbit was as audacious as he had been in &quot;Hare-um Scare-um&quot; and as cool and collected as in &quot;Prest-O Change-O&quot;.

Immediately following on &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;, Bob Clampett&#x27;s &quot;Patient Porky&quot; (1940) features a cameo appearance by Bugs, announcing to the audience that 750 rabbits have been born. The gag uses Bugs&#x27; &quot;Wild Hare&quot; visual design, but his goofier pre-&quot;Wild Hare&quot; voice characterization.

The second full-fledged role for the mature Bugs, Chuck Jones&#x27; &quot;Elmer&#x27;s Pet Rabbit&quot; (1941), is the first to use Bugs&#x27; name on-screen: it appears in a title card, &quot;featuring Bugs Bunny,&quot; at the start of the film (which was edited in following the success of &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;). However, Bugs&#x27; voice and personality in this cartoon is noticeably different, and his design was slightly altered as well; Bugs&#x27; visual design is based on the earlier version in &quot;Candid Camera&quot; and &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;, but with yellow gloves, as seen in &quot;Hare-Um Scare-Um&quot;, and no buck teeth, has a lower-pitched voice and a more aggressive, arrogant and thuggish personality instead of a fun-loving personality. After &quot;Pet Rabbit&quot;, however, subsequent Bugs appearances returned to normal: the &quot;Wild Hare&quot; visual design and personality returned, and Blanc re-used the &quot;Wild Hare&quot; voice characterization.

&quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Rabbit Hunt&quot; (1941), directed by Friz Freleng, became the second Bugs Bunny cartoon to receive an Academy Award nomination. The fact that it did not win the award was later spoofed somewhat in &quot;What&#x27;s Cookin&#x27; Doc?&quot; (1944), in which Bugs demands a recount (claiming to be a victim of &quot;sa-bo-TAH-gee&quot;) after losing the Oscar to James Cagney and presents a clip from &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Rabbit Hunt&quot; to prove his point.

===World War II===

By 1942, Bugs had become the number one star of &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;. The series was originally intended only for one-shot characters in films after several early attempts to introduce characters (Foxy, Goopy Geer, and Piggy) failed under Harman–Ising. By the mid-1930s, under Leon Schlesinger, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; started introducing newer characters. &quot;Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid&quot; (1942) shows a slight redesign of Bugs, with less-prominent front teeth and a rounder head. The character was later reworked by Robert McKimson, then an animator in Clampett&#x27;s unit, for &quot;Tortoise Wins by a Hare&quot; (1943), with more slanted eyes, longer teeth and a much larger mouth. The redesign at first was only used in the films created by Clampett&#x27;s unit, but in time it was taken up by the other directors, with Freleng and Frank Tashlin the first. McKimson would use another version of the rabbit by Jean Blanchard until 1949 (as did Art Davis for the one Bugs Bunny film he directed, &quot;Bowery Bugs&quot;) when he started using the version he had designed for Clampett. Jones came up with his own slight modification, and the voice had slight variations between the units. Bugs also made cameos in Avery&#x27;s final Warner Bros. cartoon, &quot;Crazy Cruise&quot;.

Since Bugs&#x27; fifth appearance in &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;, he appeared in color &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; films (making him one of the few recurring characters created for the series in the Schlesinger era prior to the full conversion to color), alongside Egghead, Inki, Sniffles, and Elmer Fudd (who actually co-existed in 1937 along with Egghead as a separate character). While Bugs made a cameo in &quot;Porky Pig&#x27;s Feat&quot; (1943), this was his only appearance in a black-and-white &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; film. He did not star in a &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; film until that series made its complete conversion to only color cartoons beginning in 1944. &quot;Buckaroo Bugs&quot; was Bugs&#x27; first film in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series and was also the last Warner Bros. cartoon to credit Schlesinger (as he had retired and sold his studio to Warner Bros. that year).

Bugs&#x27; popularity soared during World War II because of his free and easy attitude, and he began receiving special star billing in his cartoons by 1943. By that time, Warner Bros. had become the most profitable cartoon studio in the United States. In company with cartoon studios such as Disney and Famous Studios, Warners pitted its characters against Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Francisco Franco, and the Japanese. &quot;Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips&quot; (1944) features Bugs at odds with a group of Japanese soldiers. This cartoon has since been pulled from distribution due to its depiction of Japanese people. One US Navy propaganda film saved from destruction features the voice of Mel Blanc in &quot;Tokyo Woes&quot; (1945) about the propaganda radio host Tokyo Rose. He also faces off against Hermann Göring and Hitler in &quot;Herr Meets Hare&quot; (1945), which introduced his well-known reference to Albuquerque as he mistakenly winds up in the Black Forest of &#x27;Joimany&#x27; instead of Las Vegas, Nevada. Bugs also appeared in the 1942 two-minute U.S. war bonds commercial film &quot;Any Bonds Today?&quot;, along with Porky and Elmer.

At the end of &quot;Super-Rabbit&quot; (1943), Bugs appears wearing a United States Marine Corps dress blue uniform. As a result, the Marine Corps made Bugs an honorary Marine master sergeant. From 1943 to 1946, Bugs was the official mascot of Kingman Army Airfield, Kingman, Arizona, where thousands of aerial gunners were trained during World War II. Some notable trainees included Clark Gable and Charles Bronson. Bugs also served as the mascot for 530 Squadron of the 380th Bombardment Group, 5th Air Force, U.S. Air Force, which was attached to the Royal Australian Air Force and operated out of Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory from 1943 to 1945, flying B-24 Liberator bombers. Bugs riding an air delivered torpedo served as the squadron logo for Marine Torpedo/Bomber Squadron 242 in the Second World War. Additionally, Bugs appeared on the nose of B-24J #42-110157, in both the 855th Bomb Squadron of the 491st Bombardment Group (Heavy) and later in the 786th BS of the 466th BG(H), both being part of the 8th Air Force operating out of England.
In 1944, Bugs Bunny made a cameo appearance in &quot;Jasper Goes Hunting&quot;, a Puppetoons film produced by rival studio Paramount Pictures. In this cameo (animated by McKimson, with Blanc providing the usual voice), Bugs (after being threatened at gunpoint) pops out of a rabbit hole, saying his usual catchphrase; after hearing the orchestra play the wrong theme song, he realizes &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m in the wrong picture!&quot; and then goes back in the hole. Bugs also made a cameo in the Private Snafu short &quot;Gas&quot;, in which he is found stowed away in the titular private&#x27;s belongings; his only spoken line is his usual catchphrase.

Although it was usually Porky Pig who brought the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; films to a close with his stuttering, &quot;That&#x27;s all, folks!&quot;, Bugs replaced him at the end of &quot;Hare Tonic&quot; and &quot;Baseball Bugs&quot;, bursting through a drum just as Porky did, but munching on a carrot and saying, in his Bronx/Brooklyn accent, &quot;And that&#x27;s the end!&quot;

===Post-World War II era===
After World War II, Bugs continued to appear in numerous Warner Bros. cartoons, making his last &quot;Golden Age&quot; appearance in &quot;False Hare&quot; (1964). He starred in over 167 theatrical short films, most of which were directed by Friz Freleng, Robert McKimson, and Chuck Jones. Freleng&#x27;s &quot;Knighty Knight Bugs&quot; (1958), in which a medieval Bugs trades blows with Yosemite Sam and his fire-breathing dragon (which has a cold), won an Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short Subject (becoming the first and only Bugs Bunny cartoon to win said award). Three of Jones&#x27; films—&quot;Rabbit Fire&quot;, &quot;Rabbit Seasoning&quot; and &quot;Duck! Rabbit, Duck!&quot;—compose what is often referred to as the &quot;Rabbit Season/Duck Season&quot; trilogy and were the origins of the rivalry between Bugs and Daffy Duck. Jones&#x27; classic &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; (1957), casts Bugs and Elmer Fudd in a parody of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. It was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1992, becoming the first cartoon short to receive this honor.

In the fall of 1960, ABC debuted the prime-time television program &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot;. This show packaged many of the post-1948 Warners cartoons with newly animated wraparounds. Throughout its run, the series was highly successful, and helped cement Warner Bros. Animation as a mainstay of Saturday-morning cartoons. After two seasons, it was moved from its evening slot to reruns on Saturday mornings. &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; changed format and exact title frequently but remained on network television for 40 years. The packaging was later completely different, with each cartoon simply presented on its own, title and all, though some clips from the new bridging material were sometimes used as filler.

===Later years===
Bugs did not appear in any of the post-1964 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; films produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises or Seven Arts Productions, nor did he appear in Filmation&#x27;s &quot;Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies&quot;. He did, however, have two cameo appearances in the 1974 Joe Adamson short &quot;A Political Cartoon&quot;; one at the beginning of the short where he campaigns on behalf of equal rights for cartoon characters everywhere, and another in which he is interviewed at a pet store, where he is on sale as an &quot;Easter Rabbit&quot;. Bugs was animated in this short by Mark Kausler. He did not appear in new material on-screen again until &quot;Bugs and Daffy&#x27;s Carnival of the Animals&quot; aired in 1976.

From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, Bugs was featured in various animated specials for network television, such as &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Thanksgiving Diet&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Easter Special&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Looney Christmas Tales&quot;, and &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Bustin&#x27; Out All Over&quot;. Bugs also starred in several theatrical compilation features during this time, including the United Artists distributed documentary &quot;Bugs Bunny: Superstar&quot; (1975) and Warner Bros.&#x27; own releases: &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot; (1979), &quot;The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie&quot; (1981), &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales&quot; (1982), and &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Quackbusters&quot; (1988).

In the 1988 live-action/animated comedy &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, Bugs appeared as one of the inhabitants of Toontown. However, since the film was being produced by Disney, Warner Bros. would only allow the use of their biggest star if he got an equal amount of screen time as Disney&#x27;s biggest star, Mickey Mouse. Because of this, both characters are always together in frame when onscreen. &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; was also one of the final productions in which Mel Blanc voiced Bugs (as well as the other &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters) before his death in 1989.

Bugs later appeared in another animated production featuring numerous characters from rival studios: the 1990 drug prevention TV special &quot;Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue&quot;. This special is notable for being the first time that someone other than Blanc voiced Bugs and Daffy (both characters were voiced by Jeff Bergman for this). Bugs also made guest appearances in the early 1990s television series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, as the principal of Acme Looniversity and the mentor of Babs and Buster Bunny. He made further cameos in Warner Bros.&#x27; subsequent animated TV shows &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, and &quot;Histeria!&quot;

Bugs returned to the silver screen in &quot;Box-Office Bunny&quot; (1991). This was the first Bugs Bunny cartoon since 1964 to be released in theaters and it was created for Bugs&#x27; 50th anniversary celebration. It was followed by &quot;(Blooper) Bunny&quot;, a cartoon that was shelved from theaters, but later premiered on Cartoon Network in 1997 and has since gained a cult following among animation fans for its edgy humor. Later that year, Bugs appeared in &quot;Yakety Yak, Take it Back&quot;, a live-action/animated all-star public service music video produced by Warner Bros. Animation for the Take it Back Foundation. This music video features various celebrities, including Pat Benatar, Natalie Cole, Charlie Daniels, Lita Ford, Quincy Jones, B. B. King, Queen Latifah, Kenny Loggins, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Bette Midler, Randy Newman, Tone Lōc, Ozzy Osbourne, Brenda Russell, Al B. Sure!, Ricky Van Shelton, Barry White, and Stevie Wonder, along with Melba Moore as herself and the voice of Tibi the Take it Back Butterfly, Dr. John as himself and the voice of Yakety Yak, Derrick Stevens as the voice of MC Skat Kat, and Squeak as the voice of Fatz.

In 1996, Bugs and the other &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters appeared in the live-action/animated film, &quot;Space Jam&quot;, directed by Joe Pytka and starring NBA superstar Michael Jordan. The film also introduced the character Lola Bunny, who becomes Bugs&#x27; new love interest. &quot;Space Jam&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office success (grossing over $230 million worldwide). The success of &quot;Space Jam&quot; led to the development of another live-action/animated film, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, released in 2003 and directed by Joe Dante. Unlike &quot;Space Jam&quot;, &quot;Back in Action&quot; was a box-office bomb, though it did receive more positive reviews from critics.

In 1997, Bugs appeared on a U.S. postage stamp, the first cartoon to be so honored, beating the iconic Mickey Mouse. The stamp is number seven on the list of the ten most popular U.S. stamps, as calculated by the number of stamps purchased but not used. The introduction of Bugs onto a stamp was controversial at the time, as it was seen as a step toward the &#x27;commercialization&#x27; of stamp art. The postal service rejected many designs and went with a postal-themed drawing. Avery Dennison printed the Bugs Bunny stamp sheet, which featured &quot;a special ten-stamp design and was the first self-adhesive souvenir sheet issued by the U.S. Postal Service.&quot;

===21st century===
A younger version of Bugs is the main character of &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot;, which debuted on Kids&#x27; WB in 2001. In the action-comedy &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot;, his definite descendant Ace Bunny is the leader of the Loonatics team and seems to have inherited his ancestor&#x27;s Brooklyn accent and rapier wit.
In 2011, Bugs Bunny and the rest of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; gang returned to television in the Cartoon Network sitcom, &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;. The characters feature new designs by artist Jessica Borutski. Among the changes to Bugs&#x27; appearance were the simplification and enlargement of his feet, as well as a change to his fur from gray to a shade of mauve (though in the second season, his fur was changed back to gray). In the series, Bugs and Daffy Duck are portrayed as best friends as opposed to their usual pairing as friendly rivals. At the same time, Bugs is more vocally exasperated by Daffy&#x27;s antics in the series (sometimes to the point of anger), compared to his usual level-headed personality from the original cartoons. Bugs and Daffy are friends with Porky Pig in the series, although Bugs tends to be a better friend to Porky than Daffy is. Bugs also dates Lola Bunny in the show despite the fact that he finds her to be &quot;crazy&quot; and a bit too talkative at first (he later learns to accept her personality quirks, similar to his tolerance for Daffy). Unlike the original cartoons, Bugs lives in a regular home which he shares with Daffy, Taz (whom he treats as a pet dog) and Speedy Gonzales, in the middle of a cul-de-sac with their neighbors Yosemite Sam, Granny, and Witch Hazel.

In 2015, Bugs starred in the direct-to-video film &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot;, and later returned to television yet again as the star of Cartoon Network and Boomerang&#x27;s comedy series &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; (formerly &quot;Wabbit&quot;).

In 2020, Bugs began appearing on the HBO Max streaming series &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;. His design for this series primarily resembles his Bob Clampett days, complete with yellow gloves and his signature carrot. His personality is a combination of Freleng&#x27;s trickery, Clampett&#x27;s defiance, and Jones’ resilience, while also maintaining his confident, insolent, smooth-talking demeanor. Bugs is voiced by Eric Bauza, who is also the current voice of Daffy Duck and Tweety, among others. In 2020, the USPS issued a new set of Bugs stamps. This was a part from a collection honoring the classic Looney Tunes characters. Bugs is presented there in a range of comical positions and facial expressions. Bugs made his return to movie theaters in the 2021 &quot;Space Jam&quot; sequel &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;, this time starring NBA superstar LeBron James. In 2022, a new pre-school animated series titled &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; aired on HBO Max and Cartoonito. He is again voiced by Eric Bauza. Bugs has also appeared in numerous video games, including the &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Crazy Castle&quot; series, &quot;Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny: Rabbit Rampage&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes B-Ball&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes Racing&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Space Race&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny Lost in Time&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny and Taz Time Busters&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal&quot;, &quot;Scooby Doo and Looney Tunes: Cartoon Universe&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes Dash&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes World of Mayhem&quot; and &quot;MultiVersus&quot;.

==Personality and catchphrases==
Bugs Bunny&#x27;s fast-talking speech pattern was inspired to a degree by the character of Oscar Shapely in the 1934 film &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;. In the film, Shapely addresses Clark Gable&#x27;s character Peter Warne as &quot;Doc&quot;, and Warne mentions an imaginary person named &quot;Bugs Dooley&quot; to frighten Shapely. Referring to the same film, Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones and Bob Clampett all claimed that Bugs&#x27; nonchalant carrot-chewing style came from a scene where Gable&#x27;s character eats a carrot while talking.
The carrot-chewing scenes are generally followed by Bugs&#x27; most well-known catchphrase, &quot;What&#x27;s up, Doc?&quot;, which was written by director Tex Avery for his first Bugs Bunny film, &quot;A Wild Hare&quot; (1940). Avery explained later that it was a common expression in his native Texas and that he did not think much of the phrase. Back then &quot;doc&quot; meant the same as &quot;dude&quot; does today. When the cartoon was first screened in theaters, the &quot;What&#x27;s up, Doc?&quot; scene generated a tremendously positive audience reaction.

Another catchphrase associated with the character&#x27;s tendency to play the trickster is &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a stinker&quot;, an acknowledgement that he engages in unfair tactics. used as early as the 1940s in shorts like the 1942 &quot;The Wacky Wabbit&quot;. This was notably exhibited in the 1953 short, &quot;Duck Amuck&quot;, in which Daffy Duck endures various humiliations at the hands of the unseen cartoonist, who in the end is revealed to be Bugs Bunny, who then says this line.

==Voice actors==
The following are the various vocal artists who have voiced Bugs Bunny over the last 80-plus years for both Warner Bros. official productions and others:

===Mel Blanc===

Mel Blanc voiced the character for 52 years, from Bugs&#x27; debut in the 1938 short &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hare Hunt&quot; until Blanc&#x27;s death in 1989. Blanc described the voice he created for Bugs in 1940&#x27;s &quot;A Wild Hare&quot; as a combination of Bronx and Brooklyn accents; however, Tex Avery claimed that he asked Blanc to give the character not a New York accent &quot;per se&quot;, but a voice like that of actor Frank McHugh, who frequently appeared in supporting roles in the 1930s and whose voice might be described as New York Irish. In Bugs&#x27; following cartoon, &quot;Elmer&#x27;s Pet Rabbit&quot;, Blanc created a completely new voice for Bugs, which sounded like a Jimmy Stewart impression, but the directors decided the previous &quot;Wild Hare&quot; voice was better. Though Blanc&#x27;s best known character was the carrot-chomping rabbit, munching on the carrots interrupted the dialogue. Various substitutes, such as celery, were tried, but none of them sounded like a carrot. So, for the sake of expedience, Blanc munched and then spit the carrot bits into a spittoon, rather than swallowing them, and continued with the dialogue. One often-repeated story, which dates back to the 1940s, is that Blanc was allergic to carrots and had to spit them out to minimize any allergic reaction, but his autobiography makes no such claim. In fact, in a 1984 interview with Tim Lawson, co-author of &quot;The Magic Behind The Voices: A Who&#x27;s Who of Voice Actors&quot;, Blanc emphatically denied being allergic to carrots.

==Comics==
===Comic books===
Bugs Bunny was continuously featured in comic books for more than 40 years, from 1941 to 1983, and has appeared sporadically since then. Bugs first appeared in comic books in 1941, in &quot;Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies Comics&quot; #1, published by Dell Comics. Bugs was a recurring star in that book all through its 153-issue run, which lasted until July 1954. Western Publishing (and its Dell imprint) published 245 issues of a Bugs Bunny comic book from Dec. 1952/Jan. 1953 to 1983. The company also published 81 issues of the joint title &quot;Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny&quot; from December 1970 to 1983. During the 1950s Dell also published a number of Bugs Bunny spinoff titles.

Creators on those series included Chase Craig, Helen Houghton, Eleanor Packer, Lloyd Turner, Michael Maltese, John Liggera, Tony Strobl, Veve Risto, Cecil Beard, Pete Alvorado, Carl Fallberg, Cal Howard, Vic Lockman, Lynn Karp, Pete Llanuza, Pete Hansen, Jack Carey, Del Connell, Kellog Adams, Jack Manning, Mark Evanier, Tom McKimson, Joe Messerli, Carlos Garzon, Donald F. Glut, Sealtiel Alatriste, Sandro Costa, and Massimo Fechi.

The German publisher Condor published a 76-issues Bugs Bunny series (translated and reprinted from the American comics) in the mid-1970s. The Danish publisher Egmont Ehapa produced a weekly reprint series in the mid-1990s.

===Comic strip===
The &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; comic strip ran for almost 50 years, from January 10, 1943, to December 30, 1990, syndicated by the Newspaper Enterprise Association. It started out as a Sunday page and added a daily strip on November 1, 1948.

The strip originated with Chase Craig, who did the first five weeks before leaving for military service in World War II. Roger Armstrong illustrated the strip from 1942 to 1944. The creators most associated with the strip are writers Albert Stoffel (1947–1979) &amp; Carl Fallberg (1950–1969), and artist Ralph Heimdahl, who worked on it from 1947 to 1979. Other creators associated with the Bugs Bunny strip include Jack Hamm, Carl Buettner, Phil Evans, Carl Barks (1952), Tom McKimson, Arnold Drake, Frank Hill, Brett Koth, and Shawn Keller.

==Reception and legacy==

Like Mickey Mouse for Disney, Bugs Bunny has served as the mascot for Warner Bros. and its various divisions. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, Bugs has appeared in more films (both short and feature-length) than any other cartoon character, and is the ninth most portrayed film personality in the world. On December 10, 1985, Bugs became the second cartoon character (after Mickey) to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

He also has been a pitchman for companies including Kool-Aid and Nike. His Nike commercials with Michael Jordan as &quot;Hare Jordan&quot; for the Air Jordan VII and VIII became precursors to &quot;Space Jam&quot;. As a result, he has spent time as an honorary member of Jordan Brand, including having Jordan&#x27;s Jumpman logo done in his image. In 2015, as part of the 30th anniversary of Jordan Brand, Nike released a mid-top Bugs Bunny version of the Air Jordan I, named the &quot;Air Jordan Mid 1 Hare&quot;, along with a women&#x27;s equivalent inspired by Lola Bunny called the &quot;Air Jordan Mid 1 Lola&quot;, along with a commercial featuring Bugs and Ahmad Rashad. 
In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; compiled a list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time as part of the magazine&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Bugs Bunny was given the honor of number 1. In a CNN broadcast on July 31, 2002, a &quot;TV Guide&quot; editor talked about the group that created the list. The editor also explained why Bugs pulled top billing: &quot;His stock...has never gone down...Bugs is the best example...of the smart-aleck American comic. He not only is a great cartoon character, he&#x27;s a great comedian. He was written well. He was drawn beautifully. He has thrilled and made many generations laugh. He is tops.&quot; Some have noted that comedian Eric Andre is the nearest contemporary comedic equivalent to Bugs. They attribute this to, &quot;their ability to constantly flip the script on their unwitting counterparts.&quot;
==Copyright status==
Under current US copyright law, Bugs Bunny is due to enter the public domain in between 2033 and 2035. However, this will only apply (at first) to the character&#x27;s depiction as Happy Rabbit in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hare Hunt&quot; which was published in 1938 (which will enter the US public domain in 2033). His later persona debut in 1940 will enter the US public domain in 2035. Although most of his pre-1948 cartoons had been in US public domain since the early 1970s, other versions of him with later developments may persist under copyright until the entry of his post-1948 cartoons in the public domain.

==Language==
The American use of &quot;nimrod&quot; to mean &quot;idiot&quot; is often said to have originated from Bugs&#x27;s exclamation &quot;What a nimrod!&quot; to describe the inept hunter Elmer Fudd. However, it is Daffy Duck who refers to Fudd as &quot;my little nimrod&quot; in the 1948 short &quot;What Makes Daffy Duck&quot;, and the Oxford English Dictionary records earlier negative uses of the term &quot;nimrod&quot;.

<text>Looney Tunes is an American media franchise produced and distributed by Warner Bros. The franchise began as a series of animated short films that originally ran from 1930 to 1969, alongside its spin-off series &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, during the golden age of American animation. Following a revival in the late 1970s, new shorts were released as recently as 2014. The two series introduced a large cast of characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig. The term &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; has since been expanded to also refer to the characters themselves.

&quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; were initially produced by Leon Schlesinger and animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising from 1930 to 1933. Schlesinger assumed full production from 1933 until he sold his studio to Warner Bros. in 1944, after which it was renamed Warner Bros. Cartoons. The &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; title was inspired by that of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;. The shorts initially showcased musical compositions owned by Warner&#x27;s music publishing interests through the adventures of such characters as Bosko and Buddy. However, the shorts gained a higher profile upon the debuts of directors Tex Avery, Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, and Robert McKimson, and voice actor Mel Blanc later in the decade. Porky Pig and Daffy Duck became the featured &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters, while &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; featured one-shot cartoons and minor recurring characters.

After Bugs Bunny became popular in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts of the early 1940s, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; moved from black and white to color production, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; having already been in color since 1934. The two series gradually lost their distinctions, and shorts were assigned to each series arbitrarily. From 1942 to 1964, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.

&quot;Looney Tunes&quot; has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in television shows, films, and other media. Bugs Bunny, in particular, is regarded as a cultural icon and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Many &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; films are ranked among the greatest animated cartoons of all time, and five of them have won Academy Awards. In 2013, TV Guide counted &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; as the third greatest television cartoon series of all time, behind &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, the latter of which also featured the voice talents of Mel Blanc and Bea Benaderet.

== History ==
&quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; were so named as a reference to Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; and were initially developed to showcase tracks from Warner Bros.&#x27; extensive music library; the title of the first &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short, &quot;Sinkin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot; (1930), is a pun on &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot;. Between 1934 and 1943, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; were produced in color and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. characters. By 1937, the theme music for &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; was &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot; by Cliff Friend and Dave Franklin, and the theme music for &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; was an adaptation of &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; by Charles Tobias, Murray Mencher and Eddie Cantor.

=== 1930–1933: Harman and Ising era ===
In 1929, to compete against Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse short cartoons, Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired Brunswick Records along with four music publishers for US$28 million (equivalent to $ million in 2025) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with Leon Schlesinger to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired Rudolf Ising and Hugh Harman to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman&#x27;s and Ising&#x27;s 1929 pilot cartoon, &quot;Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid&quot;. The first &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short was &quot;Sinkin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot; starring Bosko, which was released in 1930.

=== 1933–1936: Leon Schlesinger Productions ===
When Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters they had created. A new character called Buddy became the only star of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series for a couple of years.

New directors including Tex Avery, Friz Freleng and Bob Clampett were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery&#x27;s unit housed in a bungalow which the animators dubbed &quot;Termite Terrace.&quot; In 1935, the first major &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; star debuted, Porky Pig. He first appeared along with Beans the Cat in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot;, directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon, &quot;Gold Diggers of &#x27;49&quot;, but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot;, such as Oliver Owl and the twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts. Beans and Porky proved much more popular in comparison. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.

=== 1936–1944: More star characters and switch to color ===

The debuts of other memorable &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; stars followed: Daffy Duck in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot; (1937), Elmer Fudd in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short &quot;Elmer&#x27;s Candid Camera&quot; (1940), Bugs Bunny in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short &quot;A Wild Hare&quot; (1940), and Tweety in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short &quot;A Tale of Two Kitties&quot; (1942).

Bugs initially starred in the color &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts following the success of 1940&#x27;s &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;, and formally joined the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series with the release of &quot;Buckaroo Bugs&quot; in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; with the 1942 cartoon &quot;The Hep Cat&quot;. The final black-and-white &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short was &quot;Puss n&#x27; Booty&quot; in 1943, directed by Frank Tashlin. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner&#x27;s decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the &quot;Blue Ribbon Classics&quot; series of &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;.

Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon &quot;Crazy Cruise&quot; and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon &quot;Porky Pig&#x27;s Feat&quot;, which marked Bugs&#x27; only official appearance in a black-and-white &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.

More popular &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters were created (most of which first appeared in &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons), such as Pepé Le Pew (debuted in 1945&#x27;s &quot;Odor-able Kitty&quot;), Sylvester (debuted in 1945&#x27;s &quot;Life with Feathers&quot;), Yosemite Sam (debuted in 1945&#x27;s &quot;Hare Trigger&quot;), Foghorn Leghorn (debuted in 1946&#x27;s &quot;Walky Talky Hawky&quot;), Marvin the Martian (debuted in 1948&#x27;s &quot;Haredevil Hare&quot;), Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner (debuted in 1949&#x27;s &quot;Fast and Furry-ous&quot;), Granny (debuted in 1950&#x27;s &quot;Canary Row&quot;), Speedy Gonzales (debuted in 1953&#x27;s &quot;Cat Tails for Two&quot;), the Tasmanian Devil (debuted in 1954&#x27;s &quot;Devil May Hare&quot;), and Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog (debuted in 1953&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Sheep&quot;).

It was during this era that the series won five Academy Awards:
* &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot; (1947)
* &quot;For Scent-imental Reasons&quot; (1949) 
* &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot; (1955) 
* &quot;Birds Anonymous&quot; (1957) 
* &quot;Knighty Knight Bugs&quot; (1958)

=== 1964–1969: DePatie–Freleng and Seven Arts era ===
During the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by DePatie–Freleng Enterprises (and Format Productions) (1964–1967) and Warner Bros.-Seven Arts (1967–1969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized limited animation and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by William Lava, of &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot; which had first been used in the 1963 experimental short &quot;Now Hear This&quot; directed by Chuck Jones.

In 1967, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts commissioned an animation studio in South Korea to redraw 79 black-and-white Looney Tunes produced from 1935 to 1943 in color which were syndicated to TV stations from the late 1960s to the early 1990s.

The original &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; theatrical series ran from 1930&#x27;s &quot;Sinkin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot; to 1969&#x27;s &quot;Injun Trouble&quot; by Robert McKimson.

A Cool Cat cartoon called &quot;Stage Cat&quot; was planned, about Cool Cat being in a stage production, but it was cancelled when Warner Bros.-Seven Arts shut down.

=== 1970–1999: Syndication and return to television and film ===

The &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series&#x27; popularity was further strengthened when it began airing on network and syndicated television in the 1950s under various titles and formats. The &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts were broadcast with edits to remove scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters performing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), stereotypes, and alcohol consumption.

Production of theatrical animated shorts was dormant from 1969 until 1979, when new shorts were made to introduce the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; to a new generation of audiences. New shorts have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, though usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gained theatrical releases with movies.

In the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and television specials were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. These releases include &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot; (1979), &quot;The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie&quot; (1981), &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales&quot; (1982), &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Fantastic Island&quot; (1983), and &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Quackbusters&quot; (1988).

In 1976, the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters made their way into the amusement park business when they became the mascots for Marriott&#x27;s two Great America theme parks in Gurnee, Illinois, and Santa Clara, California. After the Gurnee park was sold to Six Flags in 1984, they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which continues to the present. (Warner Bros. parent company Time Warner would own the Six Flags chain in whole or part form most of the 1990s.)

In 1988, several &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters appeared in cameo roles in the Disney film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. The more significant cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)—particularly in the scenes where Bugs and Mickey Mouse are skydiving, and when Daffy and Donald Duck are performing their &quot;Dueling Pianos&quot; sequence.

On July 10, 1989, after a battle with heart problems, Mel Blanc died at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of cardiovascular disease. A picture depicting the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters entitled &quot;Speechless&quot; was released shortly after his death.

Viacom-owned Nickelodeon aired &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons in a show called &quot;Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon&quot; between 1988 and 1999. Initially, the Nickelodeon package included cartoons that were typically omitted from the higher-profile Saturday morning network and syndicated weekday packages, including black-and-white Bosko cartoons that had not aired in many years and cartoons from the late DePattie–Freling and Seven Arts eras. In January 1999, it was reported that the cartoons shown on Nickelodeon would move to Cartoon Network in the fall of that year. To date, &quot;Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon&quot; is the longest-airing animated series on the network that was not a Nicktoon.

In 1996, &quot;Space Jam&quot;, a live-action animated film, was released to theaters starring Bugs Bunny and basketball player Michael Jordan. Despite a mixed critical reception, the film was a major box-office success, grossing nearly $100 million in the U.S. alone, almost becoming the first non-Disney animated film to achieve that feat. For a two-year period, it was the highest grossing non-Disney animated film ever. The film also introduced the character Lola Bunny, who subsequently became another recurring member of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cast, usually as a love interest for Bugs.

In 1997, Bugs Bunny was featured on a U.S. 32 cent postage stamp, the first of five &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; themed stamps to be issued.

The &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; also achieved success in the area of television during this era, with appearances in several originally produced series, including &quot;Taz-Mania&quot; (1991, starring Taz) and &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot; (1995, starring Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny). The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, from executive producer Steven Spielberg, where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters (Plucky Duck, Hamton J. Pig, Babs and Buster Bunny, etc.), plus occasional cameos in the later Warner Bros. shows such as &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (also from Spielberg) and &quot;Histeria!&quot;. Traditional cel animation was used to animate the characters for &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;&#x27; cartoons until 1999 when it was replaced with digital ink and paint animation.

In 1979, &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; premiered. After &quot;The Chocolate Chase&quot;, there would not be another short released for seven years. In 1990, it was made so there would be about one short per year until 1998. In 2003, there would be seven shorts produced to promote &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;. The first of these to be released was &quot;The Whizzard of Ow&quot;, which appeared on a DVD release of &quot;Back in Action&quot; that was sold exclusively at Wal-Mart stores. Only about half of the shorts were shown in theaters; the rest would not be made available until 2004, when all seven shorts were included on the general home video release of the film. In 2010, five computer-animated shorts would be released and directed by Matthew O&#x27;Callaghan, who would also direct another short, &quot;Flash in the Pain&quot;, in 2014.

=== 2000–2014: Network exploration ===
In March 2000, it was revealed that the entire &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; library would be exclusive to Cartoon Network, starting with the fall of that year. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts were still airing on Disney&#x27;s ABC as part of &quot;The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show&quot; at the time and the decision led to the show&#x27;s cancellation. This decision would remain in effect for over 20 years until MeTV began airing the classic Warner Bros. cartoons (along with MGM and Paramount&#x27;s library) in January 2021. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;. Although the film was not financially successful, it was met with mixed-to-positive reviews from film critics and has been argued by animation historians and fans as the finest original feature-length appearance of the cartoon characters. In 2006, Warner Home Video released a new and Christmas-themed &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; direct-to-video film called &quot;Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas&quot;, a parody of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Other &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; TV series made during this time were &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot; (2001–2006), &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; (2003–2005) and &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot; (2005–2007).

On October 22, 2007, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons became available for the first time in High-definition via Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Live service, including some in Spanish. From February 29 – May 18, 2008, many &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; artifacts, including original animation cels and concept drawings, were on display at the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio, just off the campus of Youngstown State University, near where the Warners lived early in life.

At the 2009 Cartoon Network upfront, &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; was announced. After several delays, the series premiered on May 3, 2011. Produced by Warner Bros. Animation, the series centers on Bugs and Daffy as they leave the woods and move to the suburbs with &quot;colorful neighbors&quot; including Sylvester, Tweety, Granny, Yosemite Sam, etc. The series introduced the character Tina Russo, a duck who becomes Daffy&#x27;s girlfriend. The show also features 2-minute music videos titled respectfully &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; (as a tribute to the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; sister shorts) which features the characters singing original songs, as well as CGI animated shorts starring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner (which were removed after the first season). The series was cancelled after its second season.

Also, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner returned to the big screen in a series of 3-D shorts that preceded select Warner Bros. films. There were six in the works that began with the first short, &quot;Coyote Falls&quot;, which was released on July 30, 2010. On September 24, 2010, &quot;Fur of Flying&quot; preceded the film, &quot;Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga&#x27;Hoole&quot;, and on December 17, 2010, &quot;Rabid Rider&quot; preceded the film, &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;. On June 8, 2011, Warner Bros. Animation announced that there will be more &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; 3-D theatrical shorts; the first titled &quot;Daffy&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; with Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd, the next being &quot;I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat&quot; with Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny. &quot;Daffy&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; was to precede the film &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot;, until the studio decided to premiere &quot;I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat&quot; instead. &quot;Daffy&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; instead premiered in 2012, preceding &quot;Journey 2: The Mysterious Island&quot;. All five shorts were directed by Matthew O&#x27;Callaghan.

In 2012, several announcements were made about a &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; reboot film titled &quot;Acme&quot;, in development. Former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Jenny Slate was said to be on board as writer for the new film. Jeffrey Clifford, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; producer David Heyman, and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; writers David Katzenberg and Seth Grahame-Smith were slated to produce the film. On August 27, 2014, writers Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz were hired to script the film, directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa were in talks to direct the film, while actor Steve Carell was rumored to be starring in a lead role. Despite this, the film never entered production.

=== 2015–2021: Revival ===
At the 2014 Cartoon Network upfront, another series titled &quot;Wabbit: A Looney Tunes Production&quot; (later &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot;) was announced. Starring Bugs Bunny, the series premiered on both Cartoon Network and its sister channel Boomerang in late 2015. The series had an unusually slow rollout, with the series being moved to the Boomerang streaming service in 2017, and was eventually cancelled on January 30, 2020.

On June 11, 2018, another series, titled &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, was announced by Warner Bros. Animation. It premiered on May 27, 2020, on the streaming service HBO Max. The series features &quot;1,000 minutes of new one-to-six minute cartoons featuring the brand&#x27;s marquee characters&quot;, voiced by their current voice actors in &quot;simple, gag-driven and visually vibrant stories&quot; that are rendered by multiple artists employing &quot;a visual style that will resonate with fans&quot;, most noticeably having a style reminiscent of the styles of Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson. According to co-executive producer Peter Browngardt, &quot;We&#x27;re not doing guns, but we can do cartoony violence — TNT, the Acme stuff. All that was kind of grandfathered in.&quot; Sam Register, president of Warner Bros. Animation also served as a co-executive producer for the series. The series ended on July 27, 2023.

On February 11, 2021, it was announced two new series were in the works: &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; and &quot;Tweety Mysteries&quot;. &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; began airing on Cartoon Network as part of Cartoonito and HBO Max on July 25, 2022; &quot;Tweety Mysteries&quot; would also air on Cartoon Network. &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; is aimed towards preschoolers; while &quot;Tweety Mysteries&quot; is a live-action/animated hybrid. However, the latter was scrapped for unknown reasons.

A sequel to &quot;Space Jam&quot; titled &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;, starring basketball player LeBron James, was released in theaters and HBO Max on July 16, 2021, after a Los Angeles special screening on July 12, 2021. It is a film with a story of LeBron James&#x27; second son, Dom, who gets kidnapped by an evil AI named Al. G Rhythm (Don Cheadle), into the Warner Bros. server-verse. LeBron then assembles the Tune Squad to play against the algorithm and get his son back. It received generally negative reviews and underperformed at the box office.

=== 2022–present; Warner Bros. Discovery ownership and tax write-offs ===
A reboot of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; titled &quot;Tiny Toons Looniversity&quot; premiered on September 8, 2023, on Max and then aired the following day on Cartoon Network. The Looney Tunes characters reprise their roles as the professors at Acme Looniversity in this series.

In September 2021, it was reported that a film based on the &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, titled &quot;The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie&quot; and starring Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, was announced for release on HBO Max and Cartoon Network. However, it was reported in August 2022 that the film would instead be shopped around to other streaming services. In October 2023, it was announced the film would instead be released in theaters, becoming the first animated non-compilation feature film in the franchise to do so. In early August 2024, it was announced that Ketchup Entertainment acquired the North American theatrical distribution rights to the film.

On December 31, 2022, 256 shorts were removed from HBO Max, including &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; and &quot;Duck Amuck&quot;, though many were later re-added in March 2024 when the shorts on the service were rotated.

In August 2024, it was announced that Warner Bros. was planning to relaunch the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; theatrical film series in 2028. In October 2024, it was reported that Warner Bros. was working on a &quot;super secret &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; project&quot;.

=== Home media ===
In the 1980s, the shorts received VHS releases, with the pre-August 1948 shorts released by MGM/UA Home Video and the post-July 1948 shorts released by Warner Home Video. In 2003, Warner Home Video began releasing select shorts on DVD, aimed at collectors, in four-disc sets known as the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot; starting with Volume 1. This continued until 2008, when the final volume of the Golden Collection was released. Then, from 2010 until 2013, the company released the &quot;Looney Tunes Super Stars&quot; DVDs. There have been numerous complaints regarding the &quot;Super Stars&quot; releases, however (particularly the first two), having the post-1953 shorts in a 16:9 widescreen format. The last DVD in the &quot;Super Stars&quot; series was &quot;Sylvester and Hippety Hopper: Marsupial Mayhem&quot;, released on April 23, 2013. 2010 and 2011 saw the releases of &quot;The Essential Bugs Bunny&quot; and &quot;The Essential Daffy Duck&quot; DVDs. In 2011, the shorts were released on Blu-ray Disc for the first time with the &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection&quot; series. On September 19, 2017, Warner Home Video&#x27;s Warner Archive Collection released the five-disc &quot;Porky Pig 101&quot; DVD-set.
== Licensing and ownership ==
In 1933, Harman and Ising left, taking the rights to the Bosko characters with them. However, Warner Bros. retained the rights to the cartoons and the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; brand names, leaving their former producer Leon Schlesinger to start his own animation studio to continue the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series. With their retained Bosko rights, Harman and Ising began making cartoons at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1934 until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. MGM proceeded to form their own studio to create its own cartoons. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising&#x27;s estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. Since then, Warner Bros. has owned all rights to all post-1933 characters created by Leon Schlesinger Productions and Warner Bros. Cartoons, even after the rights to individual cartoons were placed in other hands.

In 1955, Warner Bros. sold the television distribution rights to 191 of its cartoons (which included the black-and-white &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and the black-and-white &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; made after Harman and Ising left) to Guild Films. The copyrights to those cartoons were assigned to Sunset Productions, an entity owned by Warner Bros. The cartoons were distributed by Guild Films until it went bankrupt and was bought by Seven Arts. Seven Arts bought WB in 1967, and WB regained the TV distribution rights to the black and white cartoons.

In 1956, Associated Artists Productions (a.a.p.) acquired television distribution rights to most of Warner Bros.&#x27; pre-1950 library, including all &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; (except for those sold to Guild and &quot;Lady, Play Your Mandolin!&quot;) and color &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts that were released prior to August 1948, while Warner still owned the copyright to all of the cartoons. Unlike the previous TV package, this package had the Warner titles kept intact and an &quot;Associated Artists Productions presents&quot; title inserted at the head of each reel (as a result, each &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon had the song &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; playing twice). Two years later, United Artists bought a.a.p. (which had also bought Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Popeye&quot; films) who merged the company into its television division, United Artists Television. In 1981, UA was sold to MGM, and five years later, Ted Turner acquired the pre-May 1986 MGM library, as well the rights to the a.a.p. library. In 1996, Turner&#x27;s company, Turner Broadcasting System (whose Turner Entertainment division oversaw the film library), was purchased by Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery), which was also Warner Bros.&#x27; corporate parent. Then when MGM/UA terminated its distribution deal with Time Warner in 1999, it surrendered its home video rights to the a.a.p. library to WB. Since then, Warner Home Video (now Warner Bros. Home Entertainment) has held the video rights to the entire &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; animated output by virtue of Warner Bros.&#x27; ownership of Turner Entertainment.

Starting in 1960, the cartoons were repackaged into several different TV programs that remained popular for several decades before being purchased by Turner Broadcasting System. Turner&#x27;s Cartoon Network reran the cartoons from its launch in 1992 until 2004, again from 2009 until 2017, and making a temporary return in April 2023 to celebrate WB&#x27;s 100th anniversary. &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; (not to be confused with the 2010s animated series of the same name), an early 2000s anthology produced by Warner Bros. Animation for the network, was broadcast from 2001 to 2004. The show featured shorts from the original &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; theatrical series. As of 2021, classic cartoons continue to air on CN&#x27;s sister channel, Boomerang and MeTV. Differing curated collections of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; are available for streaming on both the Boomerang streaming service and HBO Max.

Five dozen &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts from before December 1943 have lapsed into the public domain and are thus freely distributed through various unofficial releases.

== Filmography ==
== Characters ==

The major characters of the original &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series are Bugs Bunny, a clever and insouciant rabbit or hare who is portrayed as a trickster; Daffy Duck, a black duck who was originally portrayed as a screwball, but later became greedy and egocentric; Porky Pig, a stuttering pig who often appears as the straight man to Daffy, and is the oldest of the franchise&#x27;s recurring characters; Sylvester the Cat, his prey Tweety (a small canary), and their elderly owner Granny; Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, who routinely engage in high-speed chases in their home in the Southwest American desert; Elmer Fudd, an unintelligent hunter who is Bugs&#x27; oldest nemesis; Yosemite Sam, a hot-tempered cowboy who is another of Bugs&#x27; archenemies; Foghorn Leghorn, a rooster who is known for his often excessive ranting; Marvin the Martian, an alien commander from the planet Mars, who aims to conquer the Earth; the Tasmanian Devil (often nicknamed &quot;Taz&quot; in later media), a vicious, brutal marsupial with an insatiable appetite; Pepé Le Pew, a French skunk who is always looking for love and romance; and Speedy Gonzales, the self-proclaimed &quot;fastest mouse in all of Mexico&quot;. One additional major character was introduced in post-Golden Age &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; media (starting with &quot;Space Jam&quot;): Lola Bunny, a female rabbit who is usually portrayed as Bugs&#x27; girlfriend.

== Racial stereotypes and censorship controversies ==

Due to content considered offensive, stereotyped or insensitive, in 1968 Warner Bros. removed the &quot;Censored Eleven&quot; episodes of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons from broadcast or distribution. Depictions included those of African Americans (as in &quot;Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;Jungle Jitters&quot;), Native Americans, Japanese people (especially during WWII, as in &quot;Tokio Jokio&quot; and &quot;Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips&quot;), Germans, Italians, White Southerners, and Mexicans.

In 1999, Cartoon Network ceased broadcast of all of Speedy Gonzales&#x27; cartoons, due to concerns about stereotyping of Mexicans. Many Latinos protested that they were not offended, and expressed fondness for Speedy; the character&#x27;s shorts were made available for broadcast on CN again in 2002.

Many Warner Bros. cartoons contain fleeting or sometimes extended gags that make reference to racial or ethnic stereotypes, or use ethnic humor. The release of the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3&quot; includes a disclaimer at the beginning of each DVD in the volume given by Whoopi Goldberg. She explains that the cartoons are products of their time and contain racial and ethnic stereotypes that &quot;were wrong then and they are wrong today&quot;, but the cartoons are presented on the DVD uncut and uncensored because &quot;editing them would be the same as denying that the stereotypes existed.&quot; A similarly phrased written disclaimer is shown at the beginning of each DVD in the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4&quot;, &quot;Volume 5&quot;, and &quot;Volume 6&quot; sets, as well as the Daffy Duck and Foghorn Leghorn &quot;Looney Tunes Super Stars&quot; sets and the Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Europe ====
* May – Boris II, dethroned emperor (&quot;tsar&quot;) of Bulgaria, and his brother Roman manage to escape from captivity in Constantinople. They reach the Bulgarian border, but Boris is killed by mistake by the border guards. Roman is crowned as new ruler, although leadership and the control of the army remain in the hands of General Samuel (a member of the Cometopuli Dynasty).
* War of the Three Henries: Henry III (the Younger), duke of Carinthia, gets involved in a conflict over the Patriarchate of Aquileia (March of Verona) in northeastern Italy. Emperor Otto II (the Red) decides in Aquileia&#x27;s favor, prompting Henry III to go into revolt. He joins forces with Henry II (the Wrangler), duke of Bavaria. They are both joined by Henry I, bishop of Augsburg.
* August – Otto II appoints his cousin Charles, illegitimate son of the late King Louis IV (d&#x27;Outremer), as duke of Lorraine. King Lothair III – who claims the duchy as his own territory – declares war to the Holy Roman Empire. He leads an expedition into Lorraine accompanied by Hugh Capet. Lothair crosses the Meuse River and takes Aachen, sacking the imperial palace.
* Fall – Otto II invades the West Frankish Kingdom accompanied by Charles and ravages the cities of Reims, Soissons (where he halts at the Abbey of Saint Médard for devotions) and Laon. Lothair III escapes and flees to Paris, where he is besieged by imperial forces. Charles is proclaimed &#x27;King of the Franks&#x27; by Dietrich I, bishop of Metz, at Laon.
* November 30 – Otto II is unable to take Paris, he lifts the siege of the capital and withdraws. A Frankish army under Lothair III pursues and defeats the imperial rearguard while crossing the Aisne River. Otto escapes and is forced to take refuge at Aachen with Charles, after his supplies are destroyed.

==== Scotland ====
* King Kenneth II of Scotland kills his rival Amlaíb mac Illuilb (or Amlaíb), brother of the late King Cuilén, to establish himself as Cuilén&#x27;s successor.

==== Arabian Empire ====
* Spring – Sabuktigin, a Samanid general, succeeds his father-in-law Alp-Tegin as governor of Ghazna (modern Afghanistan). He enlarges his dominions and founds the Ghaznavid Dynasty.
* Summer – &#x27;Adud al-Dawla, ruler (&quot;shah&quot;) of the Buyid Dynasty, drives the Hamdanids out of Mosul and tries to unify the country. Abu Taghlib is forced to flee to the Byzantine city of Antzitene.
* Emir Sa&#x27;d al-Dawla recovers his capital, Aleppo, from the &quot;ghulam&quot; Bakjur, who receives the governorship of Homs as compensation.

<text>Year 973 ([[Roman numerals|CMLXXIII]]) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Spring – The Byzantine army, led by General Melias (Domestic of the Schools in the East), continues the operations in Upper Mesopotamia. 
* July: Melias moves against Amida (modern Turkey). He defeats the Arabs outside the walls, and begins to lay siege to the city. After a few days, a violent wind and a thick dust spreads over the Byzantine camp. Covered by the dust, the Arabs attack and route the Byzantines. Many of them are slaughtered and some, including Melias, are taken prisoner. Previous Byzantine gains in the area are lost. The wounded Melias dies later in captivity.

==== Europe ====
* May 7 – Emperor Otto I (the Great) dies at Memleben in Thuringia (modern Germany) after a 37-year reign. He is succeeded by his 18-year-old son Otto II (the Red), who becomes absolute ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. His mother Adelaide will exert great influence on Otto, although her lavish philanthropies will be a source of contention. Otto&#x27;s succession leads to conflicts in the south German duchies and in Lotharingia.

==== Britain ====
* Edgar I (the Peaceful) is crowned king during a royal ceremony at Bath by Archbishop Dunstan. In a council at Chester, Lothian (a region of the Lowlands) is ceded to Scotland, in return for fealty from King Kenneth II.
* Edgar I marches with his army north to Chester. His navy meets him there via the Irish Sea. This show of strength persuades the &#x27;Northern Kings&#x27; to submit to his overlordship (approximate date).

==== Africa ====
* Caliph Al-Mu&#x27;izz transfers the royal residence of the Fatimid Caliphate from El-Mansuriya (modern Tunisia) to the newly founded city of Cairo in Egypt. He leaves general Buluggin ibn Ziri to govern the Western North African territories, which will become the province of Al-Maghreb (meaning the West).

=== By topic ===

==== Commerce ====
* Cloves, ginger, black pepper, and other Eastern spices are available for purchase in the marketplace at Mainz. The spices are brought to the city by Jewish traveling merchants, known as the Radhanites, who have contacts in the international trade between the Christian and Islamic world (approximate date).

==== Religion ====
* January 19 – Pope Benedict VI is consecrated as the 134th pope of the Catholic Church. He is installed at Rome with the approval of Otto I and becomes a puppet ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. The Roman aristocracy resents Otto&#x27;s dominance in Roman civil and ecclesiastical affairs.
* In the Council of Winchester, Edgar I accepts a &#x27;Monastic Agreement&#x27; (called the &quot;Regularis Concordia&quot;). The document is compiled by Bishop Æthelwold and serves as a rule for how monastic life should be performed.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* May 6 – Henry II, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (d. 1024)
* September 4 – Al-Biruni, Persian physician and polymath (d. 1048)
* Adelaide I, German princess and abbess (approximate date)
* Abul &#x27;Ala Al-Ma&#x27;arri, Syrian philosopher and poet (d. 1057)

<doc id="50318" wikidata="Q178677" url="?curid=50318" title="Symmetric multiprocessing">
<text>Symmetric multiprocessing or shared-memory multiprocessing (SMP) involves a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full access to all input and output devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes. Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture. In the case of multi-core processors, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors.

Professor John D. Kubiatowicz considers traditionally SMP systems to contain processors without caches. Culler and Pal-Singh in their 1998 book &quot;Parallel Computer Architecture: A Hardware/Software Approach&quot; mention: &quot;The term SMP is widely used but causes a bit of confusion. [...] The more precise description of what is intended by SMP is a shared memory multiprocessor where the cost of accessing a memory location is the same for all processors; that is, it has uniform access costs when the access actually is to memory. If the location is cached, the access will be faster, but cache access times and memory access times are the same on all processors.&quot;

SMP systems are &quot;tightly coupled multiprocessor systems&quot; with a pool of homogeneous processors running independently of each other. Each processor, executing different programs and working on different sets of data, has the capability of sharing common resources (memory, I/O device, interrupt system and so on) that are connected using a system bus or a crossbar. 

== Design ==
SMP systems have centralized shared memory called &quot;main memory&quot; (MM) operating under a single operating system with two or more homogeneous processors. Usually each processor has an associated private high-speed memory known as cache memory (or cache) to speed up the main memory data access and to reduce the system bus traffic.

Processors may be interconnected using buses, crossbar switches or on-chip mesh networks. The bottleneck in the scalability of SMP using buses or crossbar switches is the bandwidth and power consumption of the interconnect among the various processors, the memory, and the disk arrays. Mesh architectures avoid these bottlenecks, and provide nearly linear scalability to much higher processor counts at the sacrifice of programmability:

Serious programming challenges remain with this kind of architecture because it requires two distinct modes of programming; one for the CPUs themselves and one for the interconnect between the CPUs. A single programming language would have to be able to not only partition the workload, but also comprehend the memory locality, which is severe in a mesh-based architecture.

SMP systems allow any processor to work on any task no matter where the data for that task is located in memory, provided that each task in the system is not in execution on two or more processors at the same time. With proper operating system support, SMP systems can easily move tasks between processors to balance the workload efficiently.

==History==
The earliest production system with multiple identical processors was the Burroughs B5000, which was functional around 1961. However at run-time this was asymmetric, with one processor restricted to application programs while the other processor mainly handled the operating system and hardware interrupts. The Burroughs D825 first implemented SMP in 1962.

IBM offered dual-processor computer systems based on its System/360 Model 65 and the closely related Model 67 and 67–2. The operating systems that ran on these machines were OS/360 M65MP and TSS/360. Other software developed at universities, notably the Michigan Terminal System (MTS), used both CPUs. Both processors could access data channels and initiate I/O. In OS/360 M65MP, peripherals could generally be attached to either processor since the operating system kernel ran on both processors (though with a &quot;big lock&quot; around the I/O handler). The MTS supervisor (UMMPS) has the ability to run on both CPUs of the IBM System/360 model 67–2. Supervisor locks were small and used to protect individual common data structures that might be accessed simultaneously from either CPU.

Other mainframes that supported SMP included the UNIVAC 1108 II, released in 1965, which supported up to three CPUs, and the GE-635 and GE-645, although GECOS on multiprocessor GE-635 systems ran in a master-slave asymmetric fashion, unlike Multics on multiprocessor GE-645 systems, which ran in a symmetric fashion.

Starting with its version 7.0 (1972), Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s operating system TOPS-10 implemented the SMP feature, the earliest system running SMP was the DECSystem 1077 dual KI10 processor system. Later KL10 system could aggregate up to 8 CPUs in a SMP manner. In contrast, DECs first multi-processor VAX system, the VAX-11/782, was asymmetric, but later VAX multiprocessor systems were SMP.

Early commercial Unix SMP implementations included the Sequent Computer Systems Balance 8000 (released in 1984) and Balance 21000 (released in 1986). Both models were based on 10 MHz National Semiconductor NS32032 processors, each with a small write-through cache connected to a common memory to form a shared memory system. Another early commercial Unix SMP implementation was the NUMA based Honeywell Information Systems Italy XPS-100 designed by Dan Gielan of VAST Corporation in 1985. Its design supported up to 14 processors, but due to electrical limitations, the largest marketed version was a dual processor system. The operating system was derived and ported by VAST Corporation from AT&amp;T 3B20 Unix SysVr3 code used internally within AT&amp;T.

Earlier non-commercial multiprocessing UNIX ports existed, including a port named MUNIX created at the Naval Postgraduate School by 1975.

== Uses ==
Time-sharing and server systems can often use SMP without changes to applications, as they may have multiple processes running in parallel, and a system with more than one process running can run different processes on different processors.

On personal computers, SMP is less useful for applications that have not been modified. If the system rarely runs more than one process at a time, SMP is useful only for applications that have been modified for multithreaded (multitasked) processing. Custom-programmed software can be written or modified to use multiple threads, so that it can make use of multiple processors.

Multithreaded programs can also be used in time-sharing and server systems that support multithreading, allowing them to make more use of multiple processors.

== Advantages/disadvantages ==

In current SMP systems, all of the processors are tightly coupled inside the same box with a bus or switch; on earlier SMP systems, a single CPU took an entire cabinet. Some of the components that are shared are global memory, disks, and I/O devices. Only one copy of an OS runs on all the processors, and the OS must be designed to take advantage of this architecture. Some of the basic advantages involves cost-effective ways to increase throughput. To solve different problems and tasks, SMP applies multiple processors to that one problem, known as parallel programming.

However, there are a few limits on the scalability of SMP due to cache coherence and shared objects.

== Programming ==

Uniprocessor and SMP systems require different programming methods to achieve maximum performance. Programs running on SMP systems may experience an increase in performance even when they have been written for uniprocessor systems. This is because hardware interrupts usually suspends program execution while the kernel that handles them can execute on an idle processor instead. The effect in most applications (e.g. games) is not so much a performance increase as the appearance that the program is running much more smoothly. Some applications, particularly building software and some distributed computing projects, run faster by a factor of (nearly) the number of additional processors. (Compilers by themselves are single threaded, but, when building a software project with multiple compilation units, if each compilation unit is handled independently, this creates an embarrassingly parallel situation across the entire multi-compilation-unit project, allowing near linear scaling of compilation time. Distributed computing projects are inherently parallel by design.)

Systems programmers must build support for SMP into the operating system, otherwise, the additional processors remain idle and the system functions as a uniprocessor system.

SMP systems can also lead to more complexity regarding instruction sets. A homogeneous processor system typically requires extra registers for &quot;special instructions&quot; such as SIMD (MMX, SSE, etc.), while a heterogeneous system can implement different types of hardware for different instructions/uses.

== Performance ==
When more than one program executes at the same time, an SMP system has considerably better performance than a uniprocessor system, because different programs can run on different CPUs simultaneously. Conversely, asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) usually allows only one processor to run a program or task at a time. For example, AMP can be used in assigning specific tasks to CPU based to priority and importance of task completion. AMP was created well before SMP in terms of handling multiple CPUs, which explains the lack of performance based on the example provided.

In cases where an SMP environment processes many jobs, administrators often experience a loss of hardware efficiency. Software programs have been developed to schedule jobs and other functions of the computer so that the processor utilization reaches its maximum potential. Good software packages can achieve this maximum potential by scheduling each CPU separately, as well as being able to integrate multiple SMP machines and clusters.

Access to RAM is serialized; this and cache coherency issues cause performance to lag slightly behind the number of additional processors in the system.

== Alternatives ==

SMP uses a single shared system bus that represents one of the earliest styles of multiprocessor machine architectures, typically used for building smaller computers with up to 8 processors.

Larger computer systems might use newer architectures such as NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access), which dedicates different memory banks to different processors. In a NUMA architecture, processors may access local memory quickly and remote memory more slowly. This can dramatically improve memory throughput as long as the data are localized to specific processes (and thus processors). On the downside, NUMA makes the cost of moving data from one processor to another, as in workload balancing, more expensive. The benefits of NUMA are limited to particular workloads, notably on servers where the data are often associated strongly with certain tasks or users.

Finally, there is computer clustered multiprocessing (such as Beowulf), in which not all memory is available to all processors. Clustering techniques are used fairly extensively to build very large supercomputers.

== Variable SMP ==
Variable Symmetric Multiprocessing (vSMP) is a specific mobile use case technology initiated by NVIDIA. This technology includes an extra fifth core in a quad-core device, called the Companion core, built specifically for executing tasks at a lower frequency during mobile active standby mode, video playback, and music playback.

Project Kal-El (Tegra 3), patented by NVIDIA, was the first SoC (System on Chip) to implement this new vSMP technology. This technology not only reduces mobile power consumption during active standby state, but also maximizes quad core performance during active usage for intensive mobile applications. Overall this technology addresses the need for increase in battery life performance during active and standby usage by reducing the power consumption in mobile processors.

Unlike current SMP architectures, the vSMP Companion core is OS transparent meaning that the operating system and the running applications are totally unaware of this extra core but are still able to take advantage of it. Some of the advantages of the vSMP architecture includes cache coherency, OS efficiency, and power optimization. The advantages for this architecture are explained below:

*Cache coherency: There are no consequences for synchronizing caches between cores running at different frequencies since vSMP does not allow the companion core and the main cores to run simultaneously.
*OS efficiency: It is inefficient when multiple CPU cores are run at different asynchronous frequencies because this could lead to possible scheduling issues. With vSMP, the active CPU cores will run at similar frequencies to optimize OS scheduling.
*Power optimization: In asynchronous clocking based architecture, each core is on a different power plane to handle voltage adjustments for different operating frequencies. The result of this could impact performance. vSMP technology is able to dynamically enable and disable certain cores for active and standby usage, reducing overall power consumption.

These advantages lead the vSMP architecture to considerably benefit over other architectures using asynchronous clocking technologies.

<text>Amy Ruth Tan (born February 19, 1952) is an American author best known for her novel &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; (1989), which was adapted into a 1993 film. She is also known for other novels, short story collections, children&#x27;s books, and a memoir.

Tan has earned a number of awards acknowledging her contributions to literary culture, including the National Humanities Medal, the Carl Sandburg Literary Award, and the Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service. 

Tan has written several other novels, including &quot;The Kitchen God&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1991), &quot;The Hundred Secret Senses&quot; (1995), &quot;The Bonesetter&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2001), &quot;Saving Fish from Drowning&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Valley of Amazement&quot; (2013). Tan has also written two children&#x27;s books: &quot;The Moon Lady&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Chinese Siamese Cat&quot; (1994), which was turned into an animated series that aired on PBS. Tan&#x27;s latest book is &quot;The Backyard Bird Chronicles&quot; (2024), an illustrated account of her experiences with birding and the 2016-era sociopolitical climate.

==Early life and education==
Amy was born in Oakland, California. She is the second of three children born to Chinese immigrants John and Daisy Tan. Her father was an electrical engineer and Baptist minister who traveled to the United States, in order to escape the chaos of the Chinese Civil War. She recounts that her father and she would read the thesaurus together, since “he was very interested in what a word contains.” This was the beginning of her path to becoming a writer, as she wanted to use words to create stories to make herself feel understood. Amy attended Marian A. Peterson High School in Sunnyvale, for a year. When she was fifteen, her father and older brother, Peter, both died of brain tumors within six months of each other.
Her mother Daisy subsequently moved Amy and her younger brother, John Jr, to Switzerland, where Amy finished high school at the Institut Monte Rosa, Montreux. During this period, Amy learned about her mother&#x27;s previous marriage to another man in China, of their four children (a son who died as a toddler and three daughters). She also learned how her mother left those children in Shanghai. This incident was a key part of the basis for Amy&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;. In 1987, Amy traveled with Daisy to China, where she met her three half-sisters.

Amy had a difficult relationship with her mother. At one point, Daisy held a knife to Amy&#x27;s throat and threatened to kill her while the two were arguing over Amy&#x27;s new boyfriend. Her mother wanted Amy to be independent, stressing that Amy needed to make sure she was self-sufficient. Amy later found out that her mother had three abortions, while in China. Daisy often threatened to kill herself, saying that she wanted to join her mother (Amy&#x27;s grandmother, who died by suicide). She attempted suicide but never succeeded. Daisy died in 1999 at the age of 83; she had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Amy and her mother did not speak for six months, after Amy dropped out of the Baptist college her mother had selected for her, Linfield College in Oregon, to follow her boyfriend to San Jose City College in California. Amy met him on a blind date, and she married him in 1974. Amy, later, received bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in English and linguistics from San José State University. She took doctoral courses in linguistics at University of California, Santa Cruz and University of California, Berkeley.

== Career ==
While in school, Tan worked several odd jobs—serving as a switchboard operator, carhop, bartender, and pizza maker—before starting a writing career. As a freelance business writer, she worked on projects for AT&amp;T, IBM, Bank of America, and Pacific Bell, writing under non-Chinese-sounding pseudonyms. These projects had turned into a 90-hours-a-week workaholism.
=== The Joy Luck Club ===
Early in 1985, Tan began writing her first novel, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;, while working as a business writer. She joined a writers&#x27; workshop, the Squaw Valley Program, to refine her draft. She submitted a part of the draft novel as a story titled &#x27;Endgame&#x27; to the workshop&quot;.&quot; Before attending the program, Tan read Louise Erdrich&#x27;s Love Medicine and was &quot;amazed by her voice... [she] could identify with the powerful images, the beautiful language, and such moving stories.&quot; Later, many critics compared Tan to Erdrich. Author Molly Giles, who was teaching at the workshop, encouraged Tan to send some of her writing to magazines. Tan credits Giles with guiding her to the end of writing the book. It began with Giles&#x27; seeing a dozen stories in the 13 page draft submitted to the program. Stories by Tan, drawn from the manuscript of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Joy Luck Club&quot;, were published by both FM Magazine and &quot;Seventeen,&quot; although a story was rejected by the &quot;New Yorker&quot;&quot;.&quot;

After the acceptances and a rejection, Tan joined a new San Francisco writers&#x27; group led by Giles.&quot;&quot; Giles recommended Tan to academic-turned agent Sandra Dijkstra, in 1987. In May of that year, an Italian magazine translated and published &#x27;Endgame,&#x27; without permission. Dijkstra advised Tan to send her another story; &quot;Waiting Between the Trees&quot; arrived, written as an experiment to decide whether the stories collectively become a novel or a book of short stories. Dijkstra signed up Tan and asked Tan to write a synopsis for the book, along with an outline for other stories.&quot;&quot; 

Working with Dijkstra, Tan published several other parts of the novel as short stories, before it was sent as a draft novel manuscript. She received offers from several major publishing houses, including A.A. Knopf, Vintage, Harper &amp; Row, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Simon and Schuster, and Putnam Books, but she declined them all, as they offered compensation that she and the agent considered to be insufficient. Tan eventually accepted a second offer from G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons for $50,000 in December 1987. &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; consists of eight related stories about the experiences of four Chinese–American mother–daughter pairs. Tan dedicated the book to her mother, with the following words: &quot;You asked me, once, what I would remember. This, and much more.&quot;

Being a realist, Tan had predicted to her husband that the novel would disappear from the bookstore shelves, after six weeks. She thought that most first novels meet that fate, within that time. Putnam Books auctioned the reprint rights in April 1989, which were bought by Vintage Books, the trade paperback division of Random House. Vintage&#x27;s successful bid was at US$ 1.2 million. However, Random House decided to alter plans, and Ivy Books was assigned to print the paperback version, first, in the mass-market version, followed by Vintage, for a smaller audience, as a more expensively produced version. When the paperback version came out, its hardcover had already undergone 27 printings, with sales of over 200,000 copies. By 1991, the book had already been translated into 17 languages.

=== The Kitchen God&#x27;s Wife ===
Tan&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Kitchen God&#x27;s Wife&quot;, also focuses on the relationship between an immigrant Chinese mother and her American-born daughter. On its writing inspiration, Tan explained, &quot;My mother said, when I started &quot;The&quot; &quot;Kitchen&quot; &quot;God&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Wife&quot;, that she liked &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; very much, it&#x27;s very fictional, but next time, tell my story.&quot; Tan added that there are many fictionalized parts in the story narration, too. Tan, later, referred to this book as the &quot;much more&quot; that she remembered, as mentioned in the dedication page of her first book. This novel is significant, as it narrates a historical period of China between the 1930s and 1940s, including Nanjing Massacre.

G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons released the book in June 1991 and priced the hardcover at US$ 21.95.

=== Other books ===
Tan&#x27;s third novel, &quot;The Hundred Secret Senses&quot;, was a departure from the first two novels, in focusing on the relationships between sisters, inspired, partly, by one of the half-siblings Tan sponsored to the United States. 

Tan&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;The Bonesetter&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, returns to the theme of an immigrant Chinese woman and her American-born daughter.

In 2024, Tan published &quot;The Backyard Bird Chronicles&quot;, her illustrated account of birding as a coping mechanism during the divisive 2016 US Presidential election.

===Where the Past Begins: A Writer&#x27;s Memoir===
4th Estate published Tan&#x27;s memoir, in October 2017. The book cover was released earlier in April. In the book, using family photographs and journal entries, she writes about the relationship with her mother, the death of her father and brother, stories of her half-sisters and grandmother in China, her diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease, and life as a writer. In comparison to her fiction writing, Tan said a memoir is &quot;unvarnished.” While writing a memoir, her recollection and sequence of events might not be orderly for the reader. They emerge according to their importance and how they shaped her.

==Other media==
Tan was the &quot;lead rhythm dominatrix,” backup singer and second tambourine with the Rock Bottom Remainders literary garage band. Before the band retired from touring, it had raised more than a million dollars for literacy programs. Tan appeared as herself in the third episode of Season 12 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Insane Clown Poppy.&quot;

Tan&#x27;s work has been adapted into several different forms of media. &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; was adapted into a play, in 1993; that same year, director Wayne Wang adapted the book into a film. &quot;The Bonesetter&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was adapted into an opera, in 2008. Tan&#x27;s children&#x27;s book, &quot;Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat,&quot; was adapted into an PBS animated television show, also named &quot;Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat&quot;.

In May 2021, the documentary &quot;Amy Tan: Unintended Memoir&quot; was released in the American Masters series on PBS. (It was later released on Netflix.)

==Critical reception==

Tan&#x27;s writing has been praised for its bravery in exploring both the personal struggles and triumphs of immigrant families. Her first book, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;, which is considered a prominent contribution to the Modern Period of American literature, was called &quot;a jewel of a book&quot; by the New York Times, noting Tan&#x27;s &quot;deep empathy for her subject matter&quot; and the &quot;rare fidelity and beauty&quot; of her storytelling. &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; went on to be a bestseller, and was a finalist for both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. That book, and her subsequent novels, have spent forty weeks on the New York Times Bestsellers list.

In 2021, Tan was presented the National Humanities Medal for her contribution to expanding the American literary canon, and in the same year won the Carl Sandburg Literary Award. Tan also received the Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service for her contribution to world community.

Tan has received criticism, notably from Sau-ling Cynthia Wong, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who wrote that Tan&#x27;s novels &quot;are often products of the American-born writer&#x27;s own heavily mediated understanding of things Chinese,” and author Frank Chin, who has said that her novels &quot;demonstrate a vested interest in casting Chinese men in the worst possible light&quot;. Tan, in response, however, has dismissed these criticisms, stating that her works arise from her personal family experiences as a Chinese-American and are not intended as a representation of the general Chinese/Asian American experience.

== Personal life ==
While Tan was studying at Berkeley, her roommate was murdered, and Tan had to identify the body. The incident left her temporarily mute. She said that every year, for ten years, on the anniversary of the day she identified the body, she lost her voice.

Tan believes she developed chronic Lyme disease, a condition unrecognized by medical science, in 1998. She attributes health complications like epileptic seizures to chronic Lyme disease. Tan co-founded LymeAid 4 Kids, which helps uninsured children pay for treatment.

Tan also developed depression, for which she was prescribed antidepressants. Part of the reason that Tan chose not to have children was a fear that she would pass on a genetic legacy of mental instability—her maternal grandmother died by suicide, her mother threatened suicide often, and she herself has struggled with suicidal ideation.

In February 2025, the Bancroft Library of University of California, Berkeley, announced that it had acquired an archive of Tan&#x27;s work through a combination of donations and purchases using endowment funds. Having previously claimed that she would have her possessions shredded upon death to avoid posthumous scrutiny, Tan explained her change-of-heart as accepting posterity.

Tan lives near San Francisco in Sausalito, California, with her husband, Lou DeMattei (whom she married in 1974), in a house they designed &quot;to feel open and airy, like a tree house, but also to be a place where we could live, comfortably, into old age&quot; with accessibility features. In recent years, she has developed interests in birding and nature journaling.

<text>Polari () is a form of slang or cant historically used primarily in the United Kingdom by some actors, circus and fairground performers, professional wrestlers, merchant navy sailors, criminals and prostitutes, and particularly among the gay subculture. 

There is some debate about its origins, but it can be traced to at least the 19th century and possibly as early as the 16th century. Polari has a long-standing connection with Punch and Judy street puppeteers, who traditionally used it to converse.

==Terminology==
Alternative spellings include &quot;Parlare&quot;, &quot;Parlary&quot;, &quot;Palare&quot;, &quot;Palarie&quot; and &quot;Palari&quot;.

==Description==

Polari is a mixture of Romance (Italian or Mediterranean Lingua Franca), Romani, rhyming slang, sailors&#x27; slang and thieves&#x27; cant, which later expanded to contain words from Yiddish and 1960s drug subculture slang. It was constantly evolving, with a small core lexicon of about 20 words, including: &#x27; (good), &#x27; (nearby), &#x27; (face), &#x27; (bad, in the sense of tacky or vile), &#x27; (bad, in the sense of drab or dull, though borrowed into mainstream British English with a meaning more like that of &#x27;), &#x27; (room, house, flat), &#x27; (not, no), &#x27; (man), &#x27; (woman), &#x27; (hair), &#x27; or &#x27; (smarten up, stylise), &#x27; (&#x27;to be had&#x27;, sexually accessible), &#x27; (sex) and &#x27; (see). 

There were once two distinct forms of Polari in London: an East End version which stressed Cockney rhyming slang and a West End version which stressed theatrical and classical influences. There was some interchange between the two.

==Usage==
From the 19th century on, Polari was used in London fish markets, theatres, fairgrounds, and circuses, hence the many borrowings from Romani. As many homosexual men worked in theatrical entertainment, it was also used among the gay subculture to disguise homosexuals from hostile outsiders and undercover policemen. It was also used extensively in the British Merchant Navy, where many gay men worked as waiters, stewards, and entertainers.

Although William Shakespeare used the term &quot;bona&quot; (good, attractive) in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; as part of the expression &quot;bona roba&quot; (a woman wearing an attractive outfit), &quot;little written evidence of Polari before the 1890s&quot; exists according to &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; associate editor Peter Gilliver. The dictionary&#x27;s entry for &quot;rozzer&quot; (policeman) includes a quote from P. H. Emerson&#x27;s 1893 book &quot;Signor Lippo – Burnt Cork Artiste&quot;: &quot;If the rozzers was to see him in bona clobber they&#x27;d take him for a gun&quot; (&quot;If the police were to see him dressed in this fine manner, they would know that he is a thief&quot;).

The almost identical &quot;Parlyaree&quot; has been spoken in fairgrounds since at least the 17th century and is still used by show travellers in England and Scotland. As theatrical booths, circus acts, and menageries were once common parts of European fairs, it is likely that the roots of Polari/Parlyaree lie in the period before both theatre and circus became independent of fairgrounds. The Parlyaree spoken on fairgrounds tends to borrow much more from Romani, as well as other languages and cants spoken by travelling people, such as thieves&#x27; cant and back slang.

Henry Mayhew gave an account of Polari as part of an interview with a Punch and Judy showman in the 1850s. The discussion he recorded references Punch&#x27;s arrival in England, crediting these early shows to an Italian performer called Porcini (John Payne Collier&#x27;s account calls him Porchini, a literal rendering of the Italian pronunciation). Mayhew provides the following:

There are additional accounts of particular words that relate to puppet performance: &quot;&quot; – figures, frame, scenes, properties. &quot; – call, or unknown tongue&quot; (&quot;unknown&quot; is a reference to the &quot;swazzle&quot;, a voice modifier used by Punch performers).

===Decline===
Polari had begun to fall into disuse among the gay subculture by the late 1960s. The popularity of the BBC radio comedy &quot;Round the Horne&quot;, with its camp gay characters Julian and Sandy, ensured that some of the Polari terms they used became public knowledge. The need for a secret means of communication in the subculture also declined with the partial decriminalisation of adult homosexual acts in England and Wales under the Sexual Offences Act 1967; in the 1970s, the gay liberation movement began to view Polari as old-fashioned and perpetuating harmful camp stereotypes.

===Mainstream usage===

A number of words from Polari have entered mainstream slang. The list below includes words in general use with the meanings listed: &quot;acdc&quot;, &quot;barney&quot;, &quot;blag&quot;, &quot;butch&quot;, &quot;camp&quot;, &quot;khazi&quot;, &quot;cottaging&quot;, &quot;hoofer&quot;, &quot;mince&quot;, &quot;ogle&quot;, &quot;scarper&quot;, &quot;slap&quot;, &quot;strides&quot;, &quot;tod&quot;, &quot;[rough] trade&quot;.

The Polari word &#x27;, meaning inferior or tacky, has an uncertain etymology. Michael Quinion says it is probably from the 16th-century Italian word &#x27;, meaning &quot;a despicable person&quot;. There are a number of false etymologies, many based on backronyms—&quot;Not Available For Fucking&quot;, &quot;Normal As Fuck&quot;, etc. The phrase &quot;naff off&quot; was used euphemistically in place of &quot;fuck off&quot; along with the intensifier &quot;naffing&quot; in Keith Waterhouse&#x27;s &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1959). Usage of &quot;naff&quot; increased in the 1970s when the television sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot; employed it as an alternative to expletives which were not broadcastable at the time. Princess Anne allegedly told a reporter to &quot;naff off&quot; at the Badminton horse trials in April 1982, however, the photographers who were present have since stated that this was a censored version of what she actually said.

&quot;&quot; (; alternatively spelled &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; and a number of other variety spellings), meaning to smarten up, style or improve something, became commonplace in the mid-2000s, having been used in the 2003 United States TV series &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; and &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;. &quot;&quot;, an alternative spelling of the word, was popularised by drag queen Jasmine Masters after her appearance on the seventh series of RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race in 2015.

===Legacy and revival ===
Since the late 20th and early 21st century, there has been a renewed interest in Polari, especially as a part of LGBTQ+ heritage. Gay&#x27;s the Word has held workshops in Polari, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence have translated the Bible into Polari, and Madame Jo Jo&#x27;s nightclub in Soho taught its staff to speak Polari. 

Linguist Paul Baker attributes increased interest in Polari primarily to the growing body of academic work on the subject. Author George Reiner explains that &quot;the revival of a language like Polari offers the possibility of an alternate queer linguistic space&quot; at a time when closing LGBTQ+ venues and dating apps have reduced queer social spaces.

In 2007, writer and activist Paul Burston launched Polari Literary Salon in London to platform LGBTQ+ writers. He launched the Polari First Book Prize in 2011. This was followed by the Polari Prize for LGBTQ+ writers at all stages of their career in 2019 and the Polari Children&#x27;s &amp; YA Prize in 2022. Other organisations have also taken names inspired by Polari, such as &quot;Polari Magazine&quot;, &quot;Vada Magazine&quot;, and VADA LGBTQ Community Theatre Company. 

In 2012 and 2013, Manchester artists Jez Dolan and Joe Richardson presented a performance-based tour and exhibition titled &quot;Polari Mission&quot;, which explored LGBTQ+ history and language use in the UK. This was presented at The John Rylands Library and Contact Theatre. In 2015, Dolan also translated sections of the 1957 Wolfenden Report into Polari for a commission from the UK Parliament. Dolan and Richardson also worked with Paul Baker to produce a 500-word dictionary of Polari as an app. 

In December 2016, to launch LGBT+ History Month 2017 and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Sexual Offences Act, poet Adam Lowe performed his Polari poem &quot;Vada That&quot; in Parliament&#x27;s Speaker&#x27;s House with accompaniment by musician Nikki Franklin. In 2017, a service at Westcott House, Cambridge was conducted in Polari. Trainee priests held the service to commemorate LGBT History Month; following media attention, Chris Chivers, the principal, expressed his regret.

In 2019, Reaktion Books published Paul Baker&#x27;s third book on Polari, &quot;Fabulosa!: The Story of Polari, Britain&#x27;s Secret Gay Language&quot;. His first two books on the subject (&quot;Polari: Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang&quot; and &quot;Polari: The Lost Language of Gay Men&quot;) were published in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

<text>Julian and Sandy were characters on the BBC radio comedy programme &quot;Round the Horne&quot; from 1965 to 1968 and were played by Hugh Paddick and Kenneth Williams respectively, with scripts written by Barry Took and Marty Feldman. According to a BBC Radio 4 programme on the characters, they were named after the writers Sandy Wilson and Julian Slade.

Although no longer referred to as such, the various characters played by Williams and Paddick in a section of &quot;Stop Messing About&quot; were in all but name Julian and Sandy.

==Background==
Barry Took describes the original conception of Julian and Sandy as two &quot;old theatrical chaps&quot; who were doing housework in the flat of Kenneth Horne (the &quot;straight man&quot; in the sketches), while waiting for their next acting job. However, the producer of &quot;Round the Horne&quot;, John Simmonds, did not like them and viewed the characters as &quot;too sad&quot; and suggested making them younger &quot;chorus boy&quot; types. Their first appearance was in episode four of the first series, and – although Marty Feldman apparently &quot;got tired of them&quot; – Julian and Sandy proved to be the most successful part of the show, and appeared in every episode thereafter.

As well as being a successful comedy act, Julian and Sandy were notable for being two stereotypical camp homosexual characters in mainstream entertainment at a time when homosexual acts between men were illegal in the United Kingdom. The writers and cast thought the characters worked very well as they were not simply there to be the target of a joke: in fact most of the sketches revolved around Kenneth Horne&#x27;s presumed ignorance being the target of their jokes. Paul Baker writes that these sketches, while mocking an oppressed gay identity, present gay people as cheerful, rather than &quot;indexing unhappy, ashamed identities like those in films such as &quot;Victim&quot; (1961), &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot; (1970), or the openly politicised identity adopted by members of the Gay Liberation Front&quot;.

Their use of Polari in sketches introduced the gay cant to a mass audience, and identified them as gay to those in the know. Although this prompted a brief revival, &quot;Round the Horne&quot; ultimately led to Polari&#x27;s near-demise as a means of communication between gay men.

Horne would start off usually by mentioning that he had found an advertisement in one of a selection of risqué magazines, which he would insist he bought for innocent reasons. This would lead him, more often than not, to a business in Chelsea starting with the word &quot;Bona&quot; (Polari for &quot;good&quot;). He would enter by saying, &quot;Hello, anybody there?&quot;, and Julian (Hugh Paddick) would answer, to a round of applause from the studio audience, &quot;Ooh hello! I&#x27;m Julian and this is my friend Sandy!&quot; – only once, on their second appearance, does Sandy start by introducing his friend Julian.

This quote illustrating the use of double entendre is from the sketch &quot;Bona Law&quot; (itself a pun on the name of Bonar Law, a former prime minister of the United Kingdom), featuring Julian and Sandy as lawyers:

:HORNE: Will you take my case?
:JULIAN: Well, it depends on what it is. We&#x27;ve got a criminal practice that takes up most of our time.
:HORNE: Yes, but apart from that, I need legal advice.
:SANDY: Ooh, isn&#x27;t he bold?

Here, the &quot;criminal practice&quot; refers to both the fact that Julian is a &quot;practising homosexual&quot; and also the law practice where he is currently employed. Such innuendo and double entendre was the predominant form of British humour at the time, with the &quot;Carry On Films&quot; – in which Kenneth Williams featured prominently – being an iconic example of such.

At other times, Horne&#x27;s character would pretend not to understand the more risqué meanings in Julian and Sandy&#x27;s dialogue, although it was always hinted that he was secretly in on the joke. A good example was Horne attempting to use Polari himself:

:HORNE: Would I have any of them do you think?
:SANDY: Oooh! He’s got all the Polari, ain&#x27;t he?
:JULIAN: Hmmmm, I wonder where he picks it up?

The sketches also often had Horne drawing out more about Julian and Sandy&#x27;s personal lives than he intended, as the two would misunderstand his meaning. In one sketch, discussing Julian and Sandy&#x27;s time out travelling the world aboard ship, Sandy reveals Julian was swept overboard in a storm:

:HORNE: But did you manage to drag yourself up on deck?
:JULIAN: Ooh, no, we dressed quite casual...

A recurring comedic theme of the series was Sandy (Williams) archly disclosing, or drawing out, a hinted-at salacious detail from Julian&#x27;s (Paddick) past. Apparently Julian had had an &quot;experience up the Acropolis&quot; and a tale about &quot;Bognor&quot; had apparently been divulged by Julian after he had &quot;been at the gin&quot;. There would then always be an anguished complaint from Julian of &quot;You traitor - you swore you&#x27;d never tell!&quot;, before Sandy would prompt him to explain all by imploring him to &quot;Go on - purge yourself!&quot; On a rare occasion Julian turned the tables on Sandy, and after bellowing the &quot;purge yourself!&quot; line, he then ad-libbed &quot;I&#x27;ve been dying to say that for years!&quot;

Ad-libs were a prominent part of the sketch (although on &#x27;That Reminds Me&#x27;, Barry Took denied this, saying that most of what seemed to be ad lib was scripted), and were one of the reasons for how well the humour worked, as both Paddick and Williams were accomplished and very familiar with Polari in real life conversation. Williams, in particular, would add many lines of his own (&quot;Lau your luppers on the strillers bona&quot; &quot;(play the piano)&quot; being his most extreme use of obscure Polari).

Another catchphrase often used by both characters was &quot;That&#x27;s your actual French&quot;, although Barry Took acknowledged that Peter Cook had claimed to be the first to use &quot;your actual ...&quot; as a format phrase.

The humour acquired a real edge with jokes that were both risqué and controversial. Lines such as the following were very daring for their period:

:SANDY: Don&#x27;t mention Málaga to Julian, he got very badly stung.
:HORNE: Portuguese man o&#x27; war?
:JULIAN: Well I never saw him in uniform...

In the last episode of Series 4 in 1968 (which turned out to be the last ever episode of the show, due to Horne&#x27;s sudden death) Julian and Sandy are revealed, very incongruously, to be &quot;married&quot; to a pair of &quot;dolly palones&quot; named Julie and Sandra. Also, Julian&#x27;s full name is revealed to be Julian Mungo Lestrange.

==Other appearances of the characters==
On 30 December 1987, a special edition of &quot;Wogan&quot; called &quot;Radio Fun&quot; paid tribute to BBC radio comedy. Hugh Paddick and Kenneth Williams appeared as Julian and Sandy, with Terry Wogan doing Kenneth Horne&#x27;s lines, as Horne had died in 1969. Williams himself died shortly afterwards in April 1988.

In the stage show &quot;Round the Horne ... Revisited&quot;, which ran from 2003 to 2005 and was filmed for BBC Four, Paddick and Williams (and therefore Julian and Sandy) were played by Nigel Harrison and Robin Sebastian.

<text>Ahura Mazda (; ; ), also known as Horomazes, is the creator deity and god of the sky in the ancient Iranian religion Zoroastrianism. He is the first and most frequently invoked spirit in the &quot;Yasna&quot;. The literal meaning of the word &quot;&quot; is &quot;lord&quot;, and that of &quot;&quot; is &quot;wisdom&quot;. 

The first notable invocation of Ahura Mazda occurred during the Achaemenid period () with the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great. Until the reign of Artaxerxes II (), Ahura Mazda was worshipped and invoked alone in all extant royal inscriptions. With Artaxerxes II, Ahura Mazda was gathered in a triad with Mithra and Anahita. In the Achaemenid period, there are no known representations of Ahura Mazda at the royal court other than the custom for every emperor to have an empty chariot drawn by white horses to invite Ahura Mazda to accompany the Persian army on battles. Images of Ahura Mazda, however, were present from the 5th century BC but were stopped and replaced with stone-carved figures in the Sassanid period and later removed altogether through an iconoclastic movement supported by the Sassanid dynasty.

==Nomenclature==
The most likely etymology is from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*h₂ḿ̥suros&quot;, from &quot;*h₂ems-&quot; (&quot;to engender, beget&quot;), and therefore it is cognate with Proto-Germanic &quot;*ansuz&quot;. Finnish Indologist Asko Parpola locates a borrowing from Proto-Indo-Aryan &quot;*asera-&quot; to the Uralic languages, with the meaning &#x27;lord, prince&#x27;.

&#x27;Mazda&#x27;, or rather the Avestan stem-form &quot;Mazdā-&quot;, nominative &quot;Mazdå&quot;, reflects Proto-Iranian &quot;*mazdáH&quot; (a feminine noun). It is generally taken to be the proper name of the spirit and, like its Vedic cognate &quot;medhā́&quot;, means &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;wisdom&quot;. Both the Avestan and the Sanskrit words reflect Proto-Indo-Iranian , from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;, literally meaning &quot;placing () one&#x27;s mind ()&quot;, hence &quot;wise&quot;.

In Old Persian, during the Achaemenid era, the name was either depicted using the cuneiform logograms or (genitive ), or spelled out as (&quot;a-u-r-m-z-d-a&quot;, &quot;Auramazdā&quot;). In Parthian, the name was written as (&quot;ʾḥwrmzd&quot;, &quot;Ahurmazd&quot;), while (&quot;ʾwhrmzdy&quot;, &quot;Ōhramazdē&quot;) was the Middle Persian term used during the Sassanid era.

The name may be attested on cuneiform tablets of Assyrian Assurbanipal, in the form &quot;Assara Mazaš&quot;, but that interpretation is very controversial.

==Characteristics ==

Even though it is speculated that Ahura Mazda was a spirit in the Indo-Iranian religion, he had not yet been given the title of &quot;uncreated spirit&quot;. This title was given by Zoroaster, who proclaimed Ahura Mazda as the uncreated spirit, wholly wise, benevolent, and sound, as well as the creator and upholder of Asha.

==Zoroaster&#x27;s revelation==
According to Zoroastrian tradition, at the age of 30, Zoroaster received a revelation: while fetching water at dawn for a sacred ritual, he saw the shining figure of the Amesha Spenta, Vohu Manah, who led Zoroaster to the presence of Ahura Mazda, where he was taught the cardinal principles of the &quot;Good Religion&quot; later known as Zoroastrianism. As a result of this vision, Zoroaster felt that he was chosen to spread and preach the religion. He stated that this source of all goodness was the Ahura, worthy of the highest worship. He further stated that Ahura Mazda created spirits known as &quot;yazata&quot;s to aid him. Zoroaster proclaimed that some Iranian gods were &quot;daevas&quot; who deserved no worship. These &quot;bad&quot; deities were created by Angra Mainyu, the destructive spirit. Angra Mainyu was the source of all sin and misery in the universe. Zoroaster claimed that Ahura Mazda used the aid of humans in the cosmic struggle against Angra Mainyu. Nonetheless, Ahura Mazda is Angra Mainyu&#x27;s superior, not his equal. Angra Mainyu and his &quot;daevas&quot;, which attempt to attract humans away from the Path of Asha, would eventually be defeated.

== Plutarch ==
According to Plutarch, Zoroaster named &quot;Arimanius&quot; as one of the two rivals who were the artificers of good and evil. In terms of sense perception, Oromazes was to be compared to light, and Arimanius to darkness and ignorance; between these was Mithras the Mediator. Arimanius received offerings that pertained to warding off evil and mourning.

In describing a ritual to Arimanius, Plutarch says the god was invoked as Hades gives the identification as Pluto, the name of the Greek ruler of the underworld used most commonly in texts and inscriptions pertaining to the mystery religions, and in Greek dramatists and philosophers of Athens in the Classical period. Turcan notes that Plutarch makes of Arimanius &quot;a sort of Pluto&quot;. Plutarch, however, names the Greek god as &quot;Hades&quot;, not the name &quot;Plouton&quot; used in the Eleusinian tradition (&quot;The Hidden One&quot;) and darkness.

The Arimanius ritual required an otherwise-unknown plant that Plutarch calls &quot;&quot;omomi&quot; (Haoma or Soma), which was to be pounded in a mortar and mixed with the blood of a sacrificed wolf. The substance was then carried to a place &quot;where the sun never shines&quot;&quot; and cast therein. He adds that &quot;water-rats&quot; belong to this god, and therefore proficient rat-killers are fortunate men.

Plutarch then gives a cosmogonical myth:

Oromazes, born from the purest light, and Areimanius, born from darkness, are constantly at war with each other; and Oromazes created six gods, the first of Good Thought, the second of Truth, the third of Order, and, of the rest, one of Wisdom, one of Wealth, and one the Artificer of Pleasure in what is Honourable. But Areimanius created rivals, as it were, equal to these in number. Then Oromazes enlarged himself to thrice his former size, and removed himself as far distant from the Sun as the Sun is distant from the Earth, and adorned the heavens with stars. One star he set there before all others as a guardian and watchman, the Dog-star. Twenty-four other gods he created and placed in an egg. But those created by Areimanius, who were equal in number to the others, pierced through the egg and made their way inside; hence evils are now combined with good. But a destined time shall come when it is decreed that Areimanius, engaged in bringing on pestilence and famine, shall by these be utterly annihilated and shall disappear; and then shall the earth become a level plain, and there shall be one manner of life and one form of government for a blessed people who shall all speak one tongue. — Plutarch
Scholar Mary Boyce asserted that the passage shows a &quot;fairly accurate&quot; knowledge of basic Zoroastrianism.

In his &quot;Life of Themistocles&quot;, Plutarch has the Persian king invoke Arimanius by name, asking the god to cause the king&#x27;s enemies to behave in such a way as to drive away their own best men; de Jong (1997) doubted that a Persian king would pray to his own national religion&#x27;s god of evil, particularly in public.

According to Plutarch, the king then made a sacrifice and got drunk – essentially a running gag on Persian kings in Plutarch&#x27;s writing, and thus dubious evidence for actual behavior.

==History==
===Achaemenid Empire===

Whether the Achaemenids were Zoroastrians is a matter of much debate. However, it is known that the Achaemenids were worshipers of Ahura Mazda. The representation and invocation of Ahura Mazda can be seen on royal inscriptions written by Achaemenid kings. The most notable of all the inscriptions is the Behistun Inscription written by Darius the Great which contains many references to Ahura Mazda. An inscription written in Greek was found in a late Achaemenid temple at Persepolis, which invoked Ahura Mazda and two other deities, Mithra and Anahita. Artaxerxes III makes this invocation Ahuramazda again during his reign.

In the Elamite language Persepolis Fortification Tablets dated between 509–494 BC, offerings to Ahura Mazda are recorded in tablets #377, #338 (notably alongside Mitra), #339, and #771.

The early Achaemenid period contained no representation of Ahura Mazda. The winged symbol with a male figure formerly regarded by European scholars as Ahura Mazda has been now speculated to represent the royal &quot;khvarenah&quot;, the personification of divine power and regal glory. However, it was customary for every emperor from Cyrus until Darius III to have an empty chariot drawn by white horses as a place for Ahura Mazda to accompany the Persian army on battles. The use of images of Ahura Mazda began in the western satraps of the Achaemenid Empire in the late 5th century BC. Under Artaxerxes II, the first literary reference, as well as a statue of Ahura Mazda, was built by a Persian governor of Lydia in 365 BC.

===Parthian Empire===
It is known that the reverence for Ahura Mazda, as well as Anahita and Mithra, continued with the same traditions during this period. The worship of Ahura Mazda with symbolic images is noticed, but it stopped within the Sassanid period. Zoroastrian iconoclasm, which can be traced to the end of the Parthian period and the beginning of the Sassanid, eventually put an end to the use of all images of Ahura Mazda in worship. However, Ahura Mazda remained symbolized by a dignified male figure, standing or on horseback, which is found in Sassanian investiture.

===Sasanian Empire===

During the Sassanid Empire, a heretical and divergent form of Zoroastrianism, termed Zurvanism, emerged. It gained adherents throughout the Sasanian Empire, most notably the royal lineage of Sasanian emperors. Under the reign of Shapur I, Zurvanism spread and became a widespread cult.

Zurvanism revokes Zoroaster&#x27;s original message of Ahura Mazda as the uncreated spirit and the &quot;uncreated creator&quot; of all and reduces him to a created spirit, one of two twin sons of Zurvan, their father and the primary spirit. Zurvanism also makes Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu of equal strength and only contrasting spirits.

Besides Zurvanism, the Sassanian kings demonstrated their devotion to Ahura Mazda in different fashions. Five kings took the name Hormizd and Bahram II created the title of &quot;Ohrmazd-mowbad&quot;, which was continued after the Muslim conquest of Persia and through Islamic times.

All devotional acts in Zoroastrianism originating from the Sassanian period begin with homage to Ahura Mazda. The five &quot;Gāhs&quot; start with the declaration in Middle Persian that &quot;Ohrmazd is Lord&quot; and incorporate the Gathic verse &quot;Whom, Mazda hast thou appointed my protector&quot;. Zoroastrian prayers are to be said in the presence of light, either in the form of fire or the sun. In the Iranian languages Yidgha and Munji, the sun is still called &quot;ormozd&quot;.

===Present-day Zoroastrianism===
In 1884, Martin Haug proposed a new interpretation of &quot;Yasna&quot; 30.3 that subsequently influenced Zoroastrian doctrine significantly. According to Haug&#x27;s interpretation, the &quot;twin spirits&quot; of 30.3 were Angra Mainyu and Spenta Mainyu, the former being literally the &quot;Destructive Spirit&quot; and the latter being the &quot;Bounteous Spirit&quot; (of Ahura Mazda). Further, in Haug&#x27;s scheme, Angra Mainyu was now not Ahura Mazda&#x27;s binary opposite, but—like Spenta Mainyu—an emanation of Him. Haug also interpreted the concept of a free will of &quot;Yasna&quot; 45.9 as an accommodation to explain where Angra Mainyu came from since Ahura Mazda created only good. The free will made it possible for Angra Mainyu to &quot;choose&quot; to be evil. Although these latter conclusions were not substantiated by Zoroastrian tradition, at the time, Haug&#x27;s interpretation was gratefully accepted by the Parsis of Bombay since it provided a defense against Christian missionary rhetoric, particularly the attacks on the Zoroastrian idea of an uncreated Evil that was as uncreated as God was. Following Haug, the Bombay Parsis began to defend themselves in the English-language press. The argument was that Angra Mainyu was not Mazda&#x27;s binary opposite but his subordinate, who—as in Zurvanism also—&quot;chose&quot; to be evil. Consequently, Haug&#x27;s theories were disseminated as a Parsi interpretation in the West, where they appeared to be corroborating Haug. Reinforcing themselves, Haug&#x27;s ideas came to be iterated so often that they are today almost universally accepted as doctrine.

==In other religions==
Some scholars (Kuiper. IIJ I, 1957; Zimmer. Münchner Studien 1984:187–215) believe that Ahura Mazda originates from *vouruna-miθra, or Vedic Varuna (and Mitra). According to William W. Malandra both Varuna (in Vedic period) and Ahura Mazda (in old Iranian religion) represented same Indo-Iranian concept of a supreme &quot;wise, all-knowing lord&quot;.

In Manichaeism, the name &quot;Ohrmazd Bay&quot; (&quot;god Ahura Mazda&quot;) was used for the primal figure Nāšā Qaḏmāyā, the &quot;original man&quot; and emanation of the Father of Greatness (in Manicheism called Zurvan) through whom after he sacrificed himself to defend the world of light was consumed by the forces of darkness. Although Ormuzd is freed from the world of darkness his &quot;sons&quot;, often called his garments or weapons, remain. After a series of events, his sons, later known as the World Soul, will, for the most part, escape from matter and return to the world of light where they came from. Manicheans often identified many of Mani&#x27;s cosmological figures with Zoroastrian ones. This may partly be because Mani was born in the greatly Zoroastrian Parthian Empire.

In Sogdian Buddhism, &quot;Xwrmztʼ&quot; (Sogdian was written without a consistent representation of vowels) was the Sogdian derivation of the Avestan Ahura Mazda. Adhvagh was often used as a title for Ahura Mazda. Via contacts with Turkic peoples like the Uyghurs, this Sogdian name came to the Mongols, who still name this deity &quot;Qormusta Tengri&quot; (also &quot;Qormusta&quot; or &quot;Qormusda&quot;) is now a popular enough deity to appear in many contexts that are not explicitly Buddhist.

The pre-Christian Armenians held Aramazd as an important deity in their pantheon of gods. He is thought to be a syncretic deity, a combination of the autochthonous Armenian figures Aram and his son Ara and the Iranian Ahura Mazda. In modern-day Armenia, Aramazd is a male first name.

<text>Cognitive neuroscience is the scientific field that is concerned with the study of the biological processes and aspects that underlie cognition, with a specific focus on the neural connections in the brain which are involved in mental processes. It addresses the questions of how cognitive activities are affected or controlled by neural circuits in the brain. Cognitive neuroscience is a branch of both neuroscience and psychology, overlapping with disciplines such as behavioral neuroscience, cognitive psychology, physiological psychology and affective neuroscience. Cognitive neuroscience relies upon theories in cognitive science coupled with evidence from neurobiology, and computational modeling.

Parts of the brain play an important role in this field. Neurons play the most vital role, since the main point is to establish an understanding of cognition from a neural perspective, along with the different lobes of the cerebral cortex.

Methods employed in cognitive neuroscience include experimental procedures from psychophysics and cognitive psychology, functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, cognitive genomics, and behavioral genetics.

Studies of patients with cognitive deficits due to brain lesions constitute an important aspect of cognitive neuroscience. The damages in lesioned brains provide a comparable starting point on regards to healthy and fully functioning brains. These damages change the neural circuits in the brain and cause it to malfunction during basic cognitive processes, such as memory or learning. People have learning disabilities and such damage, can be compared with how the healthy neural circuits are functioning, and possibly draw conclusions about the basis of the affected cognitive processes. Some examples of learning disabilities in the brain include places in Wernicke&#x27;s area, the left side of the temporal lobe, and Broca&#x27;s area close to the frontal lobe.

Also, cognitive abilities based on brain development are studied and examined under the subfield of developmental cognitive neuroscience. This shows brain development over time, analyzing differences and concocting possible reasons for those differences.

Theoretical approaches include computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology.

==Historical origins==
Cognitive neuroscience is an interdisciplinary area of study that has emerged from neuroscience and psychology. There are several stages in these disciplines that have changed the way researchers approached their investigations and that led to the field becoming fully established.

Although the task of cognitive neuroscience is to describe the neural mechanisms associated with the mind, historically it has progressed by investigating how a certain area of the brain supports a given mental faculty. However, early efforts to subdivide the brain proved to be problematic. The phrenologist movement failed to supply a scientific basis for its theories and has since been rejected. The aggregate field view, meaning that all areas of the brain participated in all behavior, was also rejected as a result of brain mapping, which began with Hitzig and Fritsch&#x27;s experiments and eventually developed through methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Gestalt theory, neuropsychology, and the cognitive revolution were major turning points in the creation of cognitive neuroscience as a field, bringing together ideas and techniques that enabled researchers to make more links between behavior and its neural substrates.

While the Ancient Greeks Alcmaeon, Plato, Aristotle in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, and then the Roman physician Galen in the 2nd century AD already argued that the brain is the source of mental activity, scientific research into the connections between brain areas and cognitive functions began in the second half of the 19th century. The founding insights in the Cognitive neuroscience establishment were:

* In 1861, French neurologist Paul Broca discovered that a damaged area of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis, BA45, also known as Broca&#x27;s area) in patients caused an inability to speak. His work &quot;Localization of Speech in the Third Left Frontal Cultivation&quot; in 1865 inspired others to study brain regions linking them to sensory and motor functions.

* In 1870, German physicians Eduard Hitzig and Gustav Fritsch stimulated the cerebral cortex of a dog with electricity, causing different muscles to contract depending on the areas of the brain involved. This led to the suggestion that individual functions are localized to specific areas of the brain.

* Italian neuroanatomist professor Camillo Golgi discovered in the 1870s that nerve cells could be colored using silver nitrate allowing Golgi to argue that all the nerve cells in the nervous system are a continuous, interconnected network.

* In 1874, German neurologist and psychiatrist Carl Wernicke hypothesized an association between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables.

* In 1878, Italian professor of pharmacology and physiology Angelo Mosso associated blood flow with brain functions. He invented the first neuroimaging technique, known as &#x27;human circulation balance&#x27;. Angelo Mosso is a forerunner of more refined techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).

* In 1887, Spanish neuroanatomist professor Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852–1934) improved the Golgi&#x27;s method of visualizing nervous tissue under light microscopy by using a technique he termed &quot;double impregnation&quot;. He discovered a number of facts about the organization of the nervous system: the nerve cell as an independent cell, insights into degeneration and regeneration, and ideas on brain plasticity.

* In 1894, neurologist and psychiatrist Edward Flatau published a human brain atlas “Atlas of the Human Brain and the Course of the Nerve-Fibres” which consisted of long-exposure photographs of fresh brain sections. It contained an overview of the knowledge of the time on the fibre pathways in the central nervous system.

* In 1909, German anatomist Korbinian Brodmann published his original research on brain mapping in the monograph Vergleichende Lokalisationslehre der Großhirnrinde (Localisation in the cerebral cortex), defining 52 distinct regions of the cerebral cortex, known as Brodmann areas now, based on regional variations in structure. These Brodmann areas were associated with diverse functions including sensation, motor control, and cognition.
* In 1924, German physiologist and psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873–1941) recorded the first human electroencephalogram EEG, discovering the electrical activity of the brain (called brain waves) and, in particular, the alpha wave rhythm, which is a type of brain wave.
* A first clinical positron imaging device, a prototype of a modern Positron Emission Tomography (PET), was invented in 1953 by Dr. Brownell and Dr. Aronow. American scientists specializing in nuclear medicine David Edmund Kuhl, Luke Chapman and Roy Edwards developed this new method of tomographic imaging and constructed several tomographic instruments in the late 1950s. Ph.D. in Chemistry Michael E. Phelps was able to invent their insights into the first PET scanner in 1973. PET became a valuable research tool to study brain functioning. This technique can indirectly measure radioactivity signal that indicates increased blood flow associated with increased brain activity.
* In 1971, American chemist and physicist Paul Christian Lauterbur invented the idea of MR imaging (MRI). In 2003, he received the Nobel Prize. MRI is the investigative tool for contrasting grey and white matter, which makes MRI the choice to study many conditions of the central nervous system. This method contributed to the development of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which has been used in many studies in cognitive neuroscience since 1990s.

===Origins in philosophy===
Philosophers have always been interested in the mind: &quot;the idea that explaining a phenomenon involves understanding the mechanism responsible for it has deep roots in the History of Philosophy from atomic theories in 5th century B.C. to its rebirth in the 17th and 18th century in the works of Galileo, Descartes, and Boyle. Among others, it&#x27;s Descartes&#x27; idea that machines humans build could work as models of scientific explanation.&quot;
For example, Aristotle thought the brain was the body&#x27;s cooling system and the capacity for intelligence was located in the heart. It has been suggested that the first person to believe otherwise was the Roman physician Galen in the second century AD, who declared that the brain was the source of mental activity, although this has also been accredited to Alcmaeon. However, Galen believed that personality and emotion were not generated by the brain, but rather by other organs. Andreas Vesalius, an anatomist and physician, was the first to believe that the brain and the nervous system are the center of the mind and emotion. Psychology, a major contributing field to cognitive neuroscience, emerged from philosophical reasoning about the mind.

===19th century===

====Phrenology====
One of the predecessors to cognitive neuroscience was phrenology, a pseudoscientific approach that claimed that behavior could be determined by the shape of the scalp. In the early 19th century, Franz Joseph Gall and J. G. Spurzheim believed that the human brain was localized into approximately 35 different sections. In his book, The Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System in General, and of the Brain in Particular, Gall claimed that a larger bump in one of these areas meant that that area of the brain was used more frequently by that person. This theory gained significant public attention, leading to the publication of phrenology journals and the creation of phrenometers, which measured the bumps on a human subject&#x27;s head. While phrenology remained a fixture at fairs and carnivals, it did not enjoy wide acceptance within the scientific community. The major criticism of phrenology is that researchers were not able to test theories empirically.

====Localizationist view====
The localizationist view was concerned with mental abilities being localized to specific areas of the brain rather than on what the characteristics of the abilities were and how to measure them. Studies performed in Europe, such as those of John Hughlings Jackson, supported this view. Jackson studied patients with brain damage, particularly those with epilepsy. He discovered that the epileptic patients often made the same clonic and tonic movements of muscle during their seizures, leading Jackson to believe that they must be caused by activity in the same place in the brain every time. Jackson proposed that specific functions were localized to specific areas of the brain, which was critical to future understanding of the brain lobes.

====Aggregate field view====
According to the aggregate field view, all areas of the brain participate in every mental function.

Pierre Flourens, a French experimental psychologist, challenged the localizationist view by using animal experiments. He discovered that removing the cerebellum (brain) in rabbits and pigeons affected their sense of muscular coordination, and that all cognitive functions were disrupted in pigeons when the cerebral hemispheres were removed. From this he concluded that the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem functioned together as a whole. His approach has been criticised on the basis that the tests were not sensitive enough to notice selective deficits had they been present.

====Emergence of neuropsychology====
Perhaps the first serious attempts to localize mental functions to specific locations in the brain was by Broca and Wernicke. This was mostly achieved by studying the effects of injuries to different parts of the brain on psychological functions. In 1861, French neurologist Paul Broca came across a man with a disability who was able to understand the language but unable to speak. The man could only produce the sound &quot;tan&quot;. It was later discovered that the man had damage to an area of his left frontal lobe now known as Broca&#x27;s area. Carl Wernicke, a German neurologist, found a patient who could speak fluently but non-sensibly. The patient had been the victim of a stroke, and could not understand spoken or written language. This patient had a lesion in the area where the left parietal and temporal lobes meet, now known as Wernicke&#x27;s area. These cases, which suggested that lesions caused specific behavioral changes, strongly supported the localizationist view. Additionally, Aphasia is a learning disorder which was also discovered by Paul Broca. According to, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Aphasia is a language disorder caused by damage in a specific area of the brain that controls language expression and comprehension. This can often lead to the person speaking words with no sense known as &quot;word salad&quot; 

====Mapping the brain====
In 1870, German physicians Eduard Hitzig and Gustav Fritsch published their findings of the behavior of animals. Hitzig and Fritsch ran an electric current through the cerebral cortex of a dog, causing different muscles to contract depending on which areas of the brain were electrically stimulated. This led to the proposition that individual functions are localized to specific areas of the brain rather than the cerebrum as a whole, as the aggregate field view suggests. Brodmann was also an important figure in brain mapping; his experiments based on Franz Nissl&#x27;s tissue staining techniques divided the brain into fifty-two areas.

===20th century===

====Cognitive revolution====

At the start of the 20th century, attitudes in America were characterized by pragmatism, which led to a preference for behaviorism as the primary approach in psychology. J.B. Watson was a key figure with his stimulus-response approach. By conducting experiments on animals he was aiming to be able to predict and control behavior. Behaviorism eventually failed because it could not provide realistic psychology of human action and thought – it focused primarily on stimulus-response associations at the expense of explaining phenomena like thought and imagination. This led to what is often termed as the &quot;cognitive revolution&quot;.

====Neuron doctrine====

In the early 20th century, Santiago Ramón y Cajal and Camillo Golgi began working on the structure of the neuron. Golgi developed a silver staining method that could entirely stain several cells in a particular area, leading him to believe that neurons were directly connected with each other in one cytoplasm. Cajal challenged this view after staining areas of the brain that had less myelin and discovering that neurons were discrete cells. Cajal also discovered that cells transmit electrical signals down the neuron in one direction only. Both Golgi and Cajal were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for this work on the neuron doctrine.

===Mid-late 20th century ===
Several findings in the 20th century continued to advance the field, such as the discovery of ocular dominance columns, recording of single nerve cells in animals, and coordination of eye and head movements. Experimental psychology was also significant in the foundation of cognitive neuroscience. Some particularly important results were the demonstration that some tasks are accomplished via discrete processing stages, the study of attention, and the notion that behavioural data do not provide enough information by themselves to explain mental processes. As a result, some experimental psychologists began to investigate neural bases of behaviour. 
Wilder Penfield created maps of primary sensory and motor areas of the brain by stimulating the cortices of patients during surgery. The work of Sperry and Gazzaniga on split brain patients in the 1950s was also instrumental in the progress of the field. The term cognitive neuroscience itself was coined by Gazzaniga and cognitive psychologist George Armitage Miller while sharing a taxi in 1976.

====Brain mapping ====
New brain mapping technology, particularly fMRI and PET, allowed researchers to investigate experimental strategies of cognitive psychology by observing brain function. Although this is often thought of as a new method (most of the technology is relatively recent), the underlying principle goes back as far as 1878 when blood flow was first associated with brain function. Angelo Mosso, an Italian psychologist of the 19th century, had monitored the pulsations of the adult brain through neurosurgically created bony defects in the skulls of patients. He noted that when the subjects engaged in tasks such as mathematical calculations the pulsations of the brain increased locally. Such observations led Mosso to conclude that blood flow of the brain followed function.

Commonly the cerebrum is divided into 5 sections: the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobes, parietal lobe, and the insula. The brain is also divided into fissures and sulci. The lateral sulcus called the Sylvian Fissure separates the frontal and temporal lobes. The insula is described as being deep to this lateral fissure. The longitudinal fissure separates the lobes of the brain length-wise. Lobes are considered to be distinct in their distribution of vessels. The overall surface consists of sulci and gyri which are necessary to identify for neuroimaging purposes.

== Notable experiments ==
Throughout the history of cognitive neuroscience, many notable experiments have been conducted. For example, the mental rotation experiment conducted by Kosslyn et al., 1993, indicated that the time it takes to mentally rotate an object via imagination takes the same amount of time as actually rotating it; they found that mentally rotating an object activates parts of the brain involved in motor functioning, which may explain this similarity.

Another experiment is describes the two mechanisms of processing visual attention: bottom-up attention, and top-down attention. They define bottom-up attention is the brain visually processing salient images first, and then the surrounding information, while top-down attention involves focusing on task-relevant objects first. The researchers found that the ventral stream focuses on visual recognition, the dorsal stream is involved in the spatial information concerning the object.

As experiments in cognitive neuroscience, what these have in common is that the researchers are measuring activities or behaviors that we can see, and then determining the neural basis of the function and what part of the brain is involved.

==Emergence of a new discipline==

===Birth of cognitive science===
On September 11, 1956, a large-scale meeting of cognitivists took place at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. George A. Miller presented his &quot;The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two&quot; paper while Noam Chomsky and Newell &amp; Simon presented their findings on computer science. Ulric Neisser commented on many of the findings at this meeting in his 1967 book &quot;Cognitive Psychology&quot;. The term &quot;psychology&quot; had been waning in the 1950s and 1960s, causing the field to be referred to as &quot;cognitive science&quot;. Behaviorists such as Miller began to focus on the representation of language rather than general behavior. David Marr concluded that one should understand any cognitive process at three levels of analysis. These levels include computational, algorithmic/representational, and physical levels of analysis.

===Combining neuroscience and cognitive science===
Before the 1980s, interaction between neuroscience and cognitive science was scarce. Cognitive neuroscience began to integrate the newly laid theoretical ground in cognitive science, that emerged between the 1950s and 1960s, with approaches in experimental psychology, neuropsychology and neuroscience. (Neuroscience was not established as a unified discipline until 1971). In the late 1970s, neuroscientist Michael S. Gazzaniga and cognitive psychologist George A. Miller were said to have first coined the term &quot;cognitive neuroscience.&quot; In the very late 20th century new technologies evolved that are now the mainstay of the methodology of cognitive neuroscience, including TMS (1985) and fMRI (1991). Earlier methods used in cognitive neuroscience include EEG (human EEG 1920) and MEG (1968). Occasionally cognitive neuroscientists utilize other brain imaging methods such as PET and SPECT. An upcoming technique in neuroscience is NIRS which uses light absorption to calculate changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin in cortical areas. In some animals Single-unit recording can be used. Other methods include microneurography, facial EMG, and eye tracking. Integrative neuroscience attempts to consolidate data in databases, and form unified descriptive models from various fields and scales: biology, psychology, anatomy, and clinical practice.

Adaptive resonance theory (ART) is a cognitive neuroscience theory developed by Gail Carpenter and Stephen Grossberg in the late 1970s on aspects of how the brain processes information. It describes a number of artificial neural network models which use supervised and unsupervised learning methods, and address problems such as pattern recognition and prediction.

In 2014, Stanislas Dehaene, Giacomo Rizzolatti and Trevor Robbins, were awarded the Brain Prize &quot;for their pioneering research on higher brain mechanisms underpinning such complex human functions as literacy, numeracy, motivated behaviour and social cognition, and for their efforts to understand cognitive and behavioural disorders&quot;. Brenda Milner, Marcus Raichle and John O&#x27;Keefe received the Kavli Prize in Neuroscience &quot;for the discovery of specialized brain networks for memory and cognition&quot; and O&#x27;Keefe shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in the same year with May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser &quot;for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain&quot;.

In 2017, Wolfram Schultz, Peter Dayan and Ray Dolan were awarded the Brain Prize &quot;for their multidisciplinary analysis of brain mechanisms that link learning to reward, which has far-reaching implications for the understanding of human behaviour, including disorders of decision-making in conditions such as gambling, drug addiction, compulsive behaviour and schizophrenia&quot;.,

==Recent trends==
Recently the focus of research had expanded from the localization of brain area(s) for specific functions in the adult brain using a single technology. Studies have been diverging in several different directions: exploring the interactions between different brain areas, using multiple technologies and approaches to understand brain functions, and using computational approaches. Advances in non-invasive functional neuroimaging and associated data analysis methods have also made it possible to use highly naturalistic stimuli and tasks such as feature films depicting social interactions in cognitive neuroscience studies.

In recent years, there have been a lot of new advancements in the field of Cognitive Neuroscience. One new technique that has emerged is called shadow imaging. This method has combined different aspects of various neuroimaging techinques to create one that is more versatile. It uses standard light microscopy and melds it with fluorescence labeling of the interstitial fluid in the brain&#x27;s extracellular space. This technique can help researchers get a bigger and more detailed look at brain tissue. This can help researchers understand more on anatomy and viability for their experiments. This technique has helped to see neurons, microglia, tumor cells and blood capillaries more closely. Shadow imaging is a new approach that shows a lot of promise in the field of neuroimaging.

Another very recent trend in cognitive neuroscience is the use of optogenetics to explore circuit function and its behavioral consequences. This new technology is a combination of genetic targeting of certain neurons and using the imaging technology to see targets in living neurons. This technique allows scientists to see the neurons while they are still intact in animals and be able to trace the electrical happenings in that cell. This new technology has been used successfully in many experiments and it is helping researchers in observing brain activity and understanding its role in disease, behavior and function.

Researchers have also modified a fMRI and made it more efficient, in a technique called  direct imaging of neuronal activity or DIANA. This group of researchers changed the software to collect data every 5 milliseconds, which is 8 times faster than what the normal technique captures. After, the software can stitch together all of the images taken during the imaging and create a full slice of the brain.

=== Cognitive Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence ===

Cognitive neuroscience has played a major role in shaping artificial intelligence (AI). By studying how the human brain processes information, researchers have developed AI systems that simulate cognitive functions like learning, pattern recognition, and decision-making. A good example of this is neural networks, which are inspired by the connections between neurons in the brain. These networks form the foundation of many AI applications.

Deep learning, a subfield of AI, uses neural networks to replicate processes similar to those in the human brain. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are modeled after the visual system and have transformed tasks like image recognition and speech analysis. AI also benefits from advancements in brain imaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). These tools provide valuable insights into neural activity, which help improve AI systems designed to mimic human thought processes.

Despite the progress, replicating the complexity of human cognition remains a challenge. Researchers are now exploring hybrid models that combine neural networks with symbolic reasoning to better mimic how humans think and solve problems. This approach shows promise for addressing some of the limitations of current AI systems.

=== Cognitive Neuroscience and Neurotherapy ===

Cognitive neuroscience contributed to development of novel noninvasive neurostimulation methods and developed in parallel with Neurotherapy aimed to address symptom control and cure several conditions in medical treatment. Noninvasive neurotherapy have attracted significant attention from the scientific community since, these methods can be personalized and used in treatment independent of underlying conditions. Based on research in cognitive neuroscience, Neurostimulation techniques apply different innovations to exert an energy-based impact on the nervous system by using electrical, magnetic, and/or electromagnetic energy to treat mental and physical health disorders in patients. Since Neurotherapy aims to heal without harm and implements systemic targeted delivery of an energy stimulus to a specific neurological zone in the body to alter neuronal activity and stimulate neuroplasticity, the recent trend in the Cognitive neuroscience is the research of natural neurostimulation.

<text>In theoretical computer science, communication complexity studies the amount of communication required to solve a problem when the input to the problem is distributed among two or more parties. The study of communication complexity was first introduced by Andrew Yao in 1979, while studying the problem of computation distributed among several machines.
The problem is usually stated as follows: two parties (traditionally called Alice and Bob) each receive a (potentially different) formula_1-bit string formula_2 and formula_3. The goal is for Alice to compute the value of a certain function, formula_4, that depends on both formula_2 and formula_3, with the least amount of communication between them.

While Alice and Bob can always succeed by having Bob send his whole formula_1-bit string to Alice (who then computes the function formula_8), the idea here is to find clever ways of calculating &quot;formula_8&quot; with fewer than formula_1 bits of communication. Note that, unlike in computational complexity theory, communication complexity is not concerned with the amount of computation performed by Alice or Bob, or the size of the memory used, as we generally assume nothing about the computational power of either Alice or Bob.

This abstract problem with two parties (called two-party communication complexity), and its general form with more than two parties, is relevant in many contexts. In VLSI circuit design, for example, one seeks to minimize energy used by decreasing the amount of electric signals passed between the different components during a distributed computation. The problem is also relevant in the study of data structures and in the optimization of computer networks. For surveys of the field, see the textbooks by and .

== Formal definition ==

Let formula_11 where we assume in the typical case that formula_12 and formula_13. Alice holds an formula_1-bit string formula_15 while Bob holds an formula_1-bit string formula_17. By communicating to each other one bit at a time (adopting some &quot;communication protocol&quot; which is agreed upon in advance), Alice and Bob wish to compute the value of formula_18 such that at least one party knows the value at the end of the communication. At this point the answer can be communicated back so that at the cost of one extra bit, both parties will know the answer. The worst case communication complexity of this communication problem of computing formula_8, denoted as formula_20, is then defined to be

:formula_21 minimum number of bits exchanged between Alice and Bob in the worst case.

As observed above, for any function formula_22, we have formula_23.
Using the above definition, it is useful to think of the function formula_8 as a matrix formula_25 (called the &quot;input matrix&quot; or &quot;communication matrix&quot;) where the rows are indexed by formula_15 and columns by formula_17. The entries of the matrix are formula_28. Initially both Alice and Bob have a copy of the entire matrix formula_25 (assuming the function formula_8 is known to both parties). Then, the problem of computing the function value can be rephrased as &quot;zeroing-in&quot; on the corresponding matrix entry. This problem can be solved if either Alice or Bob knows both formula_2 and formula_3. At the start of communication, the number of choices for the value of the function on the inputs is the size of matrix, i.e. formula_33. Then, as and when each party communicates a bit to the other, the number of choices for the answer reduces as this eliminates a set of rows/columns resulting in a submatrix of formula_25.

More formally, a set formula_35 is called a &quot;(combinatorial) rectangle&quot; if whenever formula_36 and formula_37 then formula_38. Equivalently, formula_39 is a combinatorial rectangle if it can be expressed as formula_40 for some formula_41 and formula_42. Consider the case when formula_43 bits are already exchanged between the parties. Now, for a particular formula_44, let us define a matrix

:formula_45

Then, formula_46, and it is not hard to show that formula_47 is a combinatorial rectangle in formula_25.

=== Example: &quot;EQ&quot; ===

We consider the case where Alice and Bob try to determine whether or not their input strings are equal. Formally, define the &quot;Equality&quot; function, denoted formula_49, by formula_50 if formula_51. As we demonstrate below, any deterministic communication protocol solving formula_52 requires formula_1 bits of communication in the worst case. As a warm-up example, consider the simple case of formula_54. The equality function in this case can be represented by the matrix below. The rows represent all the possibilities of formula_2, the columns those of formula_3.

In this table, the function only evaluates to 1 when formula_2 equals formula_3 (i.e., on the diagonal). It is also fairly easy to see how communicating a single bit divides someone&#x27;s possibilities in half. When the first bit of formula_3 is 1, consider only half of the columns (where formula_3 can equal 100, 101, 110, or 111).

=== Theorem: &quot;D(EQ) = n&quot; ===

Proof. Assume that formula_61. This means that there exists formula_62 such that formula_63 and formula_64 have the same communication transcript formula_65. Since this transcript defines a rectangle, formula_66 must also be 1. By definition formula_62 and we know that equality is only true for formula_68 when formula_69. This yields a contradiction.

This technique of proving deterministic communication lower bounds is called the &quot;fooling set&quot; technique.

== Randomized communication complexity ==
In the above definition, we are concerned with the number of bits that must be &quot;deterministically&quot; transmitted between two parties. If both the parties are given access to a random number generator, can they determine the value of formula_8 with much less information exchanged? Yao, in his seminal paper
answers this question by defining randomized communication complexity.

A randomized protocol formula_39 for a function formula_8 has two-sided error.

:formula_73

:formula_74

A randomized protocol is a deterministic protocol that uses an extra random string in addition to its normal input. There are two models for this: a &quot;public string&quot; is a random string that is known by both parties beforehand, while a &quot;private string&quot; is generated by one party and must be communicated to the other party. A theorem presented below shows that any public string protocol can be simulated by a private string protocol that uses &quot;O(log n)&quot; additional bits compared to the original.

Note that in the probability inequalities above, the outcome of the protocol is understood to depend &quot;only&quot; on the random string; both strings &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; remain fixed. In other words, if &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) yields &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;r&quot;) when using random string &quot;r&quot;, then &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;r&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) for at least 2/3 of all choices for the string &quot;r&quot;.

The randomized complexity is simply defined as the number of bits exchanged in such a protocol.

Note that it is also possible to define a randomized protocol with one-sided error, and the complexity is defined similarly.

=== Example: EQ ===

Returning to the previous example of &quot;EQ&quot;, if certainty is not required, Alice and Bob can check for equality using only messages. Consider the following protocol: Assume that Alice and Bob both have access to the same random string formula_75. Alice computes formula_76 and sends this bit (call it &quot;b&quot;) to Bob. (The formula_77 is the dot product in GF(2).) Then Bob compares &quot;b&quot; to formula_78. If they are the same, then Bob accepts, saying &quot;x&quot; equals &quot;y&quot;. Otherwise, he rejects.

Clearly, if formula_51, then formula_80, so formula_81. If &quot;x&quot; does not equal &quot;y&quot;, it is still possible that formula_80, which would give Bob the wrong answer. How does this happen?

If &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are not equal, they must differ in some locations:

:formula_83

Where and agree, formula_84 so those terms affect the dot products equally. We can safely ignore those terms and look only at where and differ. Furthermore, we can swap the bits formula_85 and formula_86 without changing whether or not the dot products are equal. This means we can swap bits so that contains only zeros and contains only ones:

:formula_87

Note that formula_88 and formula_89. Now, the question becomes: for some random string formula_90, what is the probability that formula_91? Since each formula_92 is equally likely to be or , this probability is just formula_93. Thus, when does not equal ,
formula_94. The algorithm can be repeated many times to increase its accuracy. This fits the requirements for a randomized communication algorithm.

This shows that &quot;if Alice and Bob share a random string of length n&quot;, they can send one bit to each other to compute formula_95. In the next section, it is shown that Alice and Bob can exchange only bits that are as good as sharing a random string of length &quot;n&quot;. Once that is shown, it follows that &quot;EQ&quot; can be computed in messages.

=== Example: GH ===
For yet another example of randomized communication complexity, we turn to an example known as the &quot;gap-Hamming problem&quot; (abbreviated &quot;GH&quot;). Formally, Alice and Bob both maintain binary messages, formula_96 and would like to determine if the strings are very similar or if they are not very similar. In particular, they would like to find a communication protocol requiring the transmission of as few bits as possible to compute the following partial Boolean function, 

:formula_97 

Clearly, they must communicate all their bits if the protocol is to be deterministic (this is because, if there is a deterministic, strict subset of indices that Alice and Bob relay to one another, then imagine having a pair of strings that on that set disagree in formula_98 positions. If another disagreement occurs in any position that is not relayed, then this affects the result of formula_99, and hence would result in an incorrect procedure. 

A natural question one then asks is, if we&#x27;re permitted to err formula_100 of the time (over random instances formula_101 drawn uniformly at random from formula_102), then can we get away with a protocol with fewer bits? It turns out that the answer somewhat surprisingly is no, due to a result of Chakrabarti and Regev in 2012: they show that for random instances, any procedure which is correct at least formula_103 of the time must send formula_104 bits worth of communication, which is to say essentially all of them.

=== Public coins versus private coins ===

Creating random protocols becomes easier when both parties have access to the same random string, known as a shared string protocol. However, even in cases where the two parties do not share a random string, it is still possible to use private string protocols with only a small communication cost. Any shared string random protocol using any number of random string can be simulated by a private string protocol that uses an extra &quot;O(log n)&quot; bits.

Intuitively, we can find some set of strings that has enough randomness in it to run the random protocol with only a small increase in error. This set can be shared beforehand, and instead of drawing a random string, Alice and Bob need only agree on which string to choose from the shared set. This set is small enough that the choice can be communicated efficiently. A formal proof follows.

Consider some random protocol &quot;P&quot; with a maximum error rate of 0.1. Let formula_39 be formula_106 strings of length &quot;n&quot;, numbered formula_107. Given such an formula_39, define a new protocol formula_109 which randomly picks some formula_110 and then runs &quot;P&quot; using formula_110 as the shared random string. It takes &quot;O&quot;(log 100&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;) bits to communicate the choice of formula_110.

Let us define formula_113 and formula_114 to be the probabilities that formula_115 and formula_109 compute the correct value for the input formula_117.

For a fixed formula_117, we can use Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality to get the following equation:

:formula_119

Thus when we don&#x27;t have formula_117 fixed:

:formula_121

The last equality above holds because there are formula_33 different pairs formula_117. Since the probability does not equal 1, there is some formula_124 so that for all formula_117:

:formula_126

Since formula_115 has at most 0.1 error probability, formula_128 can have at most 0.2 error probability.

=== Collapse of Randomized Communication Complexity ===

Let&#x27;s say we additionally allow Alice and Bob to share some resource, for example a pair of entangle particles. Using that ressource, Alice and Bob can correlate their information and thus try to &#x27;collapse&#x27; (or &#x27;trivialize&#x27;) communication complexity in the following sense.

Definition. &quot;A resource formula_39 is said to be &quot;collapsing&quot; if, using that resource formula_39, only one bit of classical communication is enough for Alice to know the evaluation formula_18 in the worst case scenario for any Boolean function formula_8. &quot;

The surprising fact of a collapse of communication complexity is that the function formula_8 can have arbitrarily large entry size, but still the number of communication bit is constant to a single one.

Some resources are shown to be non-collapsing, such as quantum correlations or more generally almost-quantum correlations, whereas on the contrary some other resources are shown to collapse randomized communication complexity, such as the PR-box, or some noisy PR-boxes satisfying some conditions.

=== Distributional Complexity ===

One approach to studying randomized communication complexity is through distributional complexity.

Given a joint distribution formula_134 on the inputs of both players, the corresponding distributional complexity of a function formula_8 is the minimum cost of a &quot;deterministic&quot; protocol formula_39 such that formula_137, where the inputs are sampled according to formula_134.

Yao&#x27;s minimax principle (a special case of von Neumann&#x27;s minimax theorem) states that the randomized communication complexity of a function equals its maximum distributional complexity, where the maximum is taken over all joint distributions of the inputs (not necessarily product distributions!).

Yao&#x27;s principle can be used to prove lower bounds on the randomized communication complexity of a function: design the appropriate joint distribution, and prove a lower bound on the distributional complexity. Since distributional complexity concerns deterministic protocols, this could be easier than proving a lower bound on randomized protocols directly.

As an example, let us consider the &quot;disjointness&quot; function DISJ: each of the inputs is interpreted as a subset of formula_139, and DISJ(,)=1 if the two sets are disjoint. Razborov proved an formula_104 lower bound on the randomized communication complexity by considering the following distribution: with probability 3/4, sample two random disjoint sets of size formula_141, and with probability 1/4, sample two random sets of size formula_141 with a unique intersection.

=== Information Complexity ===

A powerful approach to the study of distributional complexity is information complexity. Initiated by Bar-Yossef, Jayram, Kumar and Sivakumar, the approach was codified in work of Barak, Braverman, Chen and Rao and by Braverman and Rao.

The (internal) information complexity of a (possibly randomized) protocol with respect to a distribution is defined as follows. Let formula_143 be random inputs sampled according to , and let be the transcript of when run on the inputs formula_144. The information complexity of the protocol is 

:formula_145

where denotes conditional mutual information.
The first summand measures the amount of information that Alice learns about Bob&#x27;s input from the transcript, and the second measures the amount of information that Bob learns about Alice&#x27;s input.

The -error information complexity of a function with respect to a distribution is the infimal information complexity of a protocol for whose error (with respect to ) is at most .

Braverman and Rao proved that information equals amortized communication. This means that the cost for solving independent copies of is roughly times the information complexity of . This is analogous to the well-known interpretation of Shannon entropy as the amortized bit-length required to transmit data from a given information source. Braverman and Rao&#x27;s proof uses a technique known as &quot;protocol compression&quot;, in which an information-efficient protocol is &quot;compressed&quot; into a communication-efficient protocol.

The techniques of information complexity enable the computation of the exact (up to first order) communication complexity of set disjointness to be formula_146.

Information complexity techniques have also been used to analyze extended formulations, proving an essentially optimal lower bound on the complexity of algorithms based on linear programming which approximately solve the maximum clique problem.

Omri Weinstein&#x27;s 2015 survey surveys the subject.

== Quantum communication complexity ==

Quantum communication complexity tries to quantify the communication reduction possible by using quantum effects during a distributed computation.

At least three quantum generalizations of communication complexity have been proposed; for a survey see the suggested text by G. Brassard.

The first one is the qubit-communication model, where the parties can use quantum communication instead of classical communication, for example by exchanging photons through an optical fiber.

In a second model the communication is still performed with classical bits, but the parties are allowed to manipulate an unlimited supply of quantum entangled states as part of their protocols. By doing measurements on their entangled states, the parties can save on classical communication during a distributed computation.

The third model involves access to previously shared entanglement in addition to qubit communication, and is the least explored of the three quantum models.

== Nondeterministic communication complexity ==

In nondeterministic communication complexity, Alice and Bob have access to an oracle. After receiving the oracle&#x27;s word, the parties communicate to deduce formula_18. The nondeterministic communication complexity is then the maximum over all pairs formula_117 over the sum of number of bits exchanged and the coding length of the oracle word.

Viewed differently, this amounts to covering all 1-entries of the 0/1-matrix by combinatorial 1-rectangles (i.e., non-contiguous, non-convex submatrices, whose entries are all one (see Kushilevitz and Nisan or Dietzfelbinger et al.)). The nondeterministic communication complexity is the binary logarithm of the &quot;rectangle covering number&quot; of the matrix: the minimum number of combinatorial 1-rectangles required to cover all 1-entries of the matrix, without covering any 0-entries.

Nondeterministic communication complexity occurs as a means to obtaining lower bounds for deterministic communication complexity (see Dietzfelbinger et al.), but also in the theory of nonnegative matrices, where it gives a lower bound on the nonnegative rank of a nonnegative matrix.

== Unbounded-error communication complexity ==

In the unbounded-error setting, Alice and Bob have access to a private coin and their own inputs formula_149. In this setting, Alice succeeds if she responds with the correct value of formula_4 with probability strictly greater than 1/2. In other words, if Alice&#x27;s responses have &quot;any&quot; non-zero correlation to the true value of formula_4, then the protocol is considered valid.

Note that the requirement that the coin is &quot;private&quot; is essential. In particular, if the number of public bits shared between Alice and Bob are not counted against the communication complexity, it is easy to argue that computing any function has formula_152 communication complexity. On the other hand, both models are equivalent if the number of public bits used by Alice and Bob is counted against the protocol&#x27;s total communication.

Though subtle, lower bounds on this model are extremely strong. More specifically, it is clear that any bound on problems of this class immediately imply equivalent bounds on problems in the deterministic model and the private and public coin models, but such bounds also hold immediately for nondeterministic communication models and quantum communication models.

Forster was the first to prove explicit lower bounds for this class, showing that computing the inner product formula_153 requires at least formula_104 bits of communication, though an earlier result of Alon, Frankl, and Rödl proved that the communication complexity for almost all Boolean functions formula_155 is formula_104.

== Lifting ==

Lifting is a general technique in complexity theory in which a lower bound on a simple measure of complexity is &quot;lifted&quot; to a lower bound on a more difficult measure.

This technique was pioneered in the context of communication complexity by Raz and McKenzie, who proved the first query-to-communication lifting theorem, and used the result to separate the monotone NC hierarchy.

Given a function formula_157 and a gadget formula_158, their composition formula_159 is defined as follows:

:formula_160

In words, formula_2 is partitioned into formula_1 blocks of length formula_163, and formula_3 is partitioned into formula_1 blocks of length formula_166. The gadget is applied formula_1 times on the blocks, and the outputs are fed into formula_8. Diagrammatically:

In this diagram, each of the inputs formula_169 is bits long, and each of the inputs formula_170 is bits long.

A decision tree of depth formula_171 for formula_8 can be translated to a communication protocol whose cost is formula_173: each time the tree queries a bit, the corresponding value of formula_174 is computed using an optimal protocol for formula_174. Raz and McKenzie showed that this is optimal up to a constant factor when formula_174 is the so-called &quot;indexing gadget&quot;, in which formula_2 has length formula_178 (for a large enough constant ), formula_3 has length formula_180, and formula_181 is the formula_2-th bit of formula_3.

The proof of the Raz–McKenzie lifting theorem uses the method of simulation, in which a protocol for the composed function formula_184 is used to generate a decision tree for formula_8. Göös, Pitassi and Watson gave an exposition of the original proof. Since then, several works have proved similar theorems with different gadgets, such as inner product. The smallest gadget which can be handled is the indexing gadget with formula_186.
Göös, Pitassi and Watson extended the Raz–McKenzie technique to randomized protocols.

A simple modification of the Raz–McKenzie lifting theorem gives a lower bound of formula_173 on the logarithm of the size of a protocol tree for computing formula_184, where formula_171 is the depth of the optimal decision tree for formula_8. Garg, Göös, Kamath and Sokolov extended this to the DAG-like setting, and used their result to obtain monotone circuit lower bounds. The same technique has also yielded applications to proof complexity.

A different type of lifting is exemplified by Sherstov&#x27;s pattern matrix method, which gives a lower bound on the quantum communication complexity of formula_184, where is a modified indexing gadget, in terms of the approximate degree of . The approximate degree of a Boolean function is the minimal degree of a polynomial which approximates the function on all Boolean points up to an additive error of 1/3.

In contrast to the Raz–McKenzie proof which uses the method of simulation, Sherstov&#x27;s proof takes a &quot;dual witness&quot; to the approximate degree of and gives a lower bound on the quantum query complexity of formula_184 using the &quot;generalized discrepancy method&quot;. The dual witness for the approximate degree of is a lower bound witness for the approximate degree obtained via LP duality. This dual witness is massaged into other objects constituting data for the generalized discrepancy method.

Another example of this approach is the work of Pitassi and Robere, in which an &quot;algebraic gap&quot; is lifted to a lower bound on Razborov&#x27;s &quot;rank measure&quot;. The result is a strongly exponential lower bound on the monotone circuit complexity of an explicit function, obtained via the Karchmer–Wigderson characterization of monotone circuit size in terms of communication complexity.

== Open problems ==

Considering a 0 or 1 input matrix formula_193, the minimum number of bits exchanged to compute formula_8 deterministically in the worst case, formula_195, is known to be bounded from below by the logarithm of the rank of the matrix formula_196. The log rank conjecture proposes that the communication complexity, formula_195, is bounded from above by a constant power of the logarithm of the rank of formula_196. Since D(f) is bounded from above and below by polynomials of log rankformula_199, we can say D(f) is polynomially related to log rankformula_199. Since the rank of a matrix is polynomial time computable in the size of the matrix, such an upper bound would allow the matrix&#x27;s communication complexity to be approximated in polynomial time. Note, however, that the size of the matrix itself is exponential in the size of the input.

For a randomized protocol, the number of bits exchanged in the worst case, R(f), was conjectured to be polynomially related to the following formula:

: formula_201

Such log rank conjectures are valuable because they reduce the question of a matrix&#x27;s communication complexity to a question of linearly independent rows (columns) of the matrix. This particular version, called the Log-Approximate-Rank Conjecture, was recently refuted by Chattopadhyay, Mande and Sherif (2019) using a surprisingly simple counter-example. This reveals that the essence of the communication complexity problem, for example in the EQ case above, is figuring out where in the matrix the inputs are, in order to find out if they&#x27;re equivalent.

== Applications ==
Lower bounds in communication complexity can be used to prove lower bounds in decision tree complexity, VLSI circuits, data structures, streaming algorithms, space–time tradeoffs for Turing machines and more.

Conitzer and Sandholm studied the communication complexity of some common voting rules, which are essential in political and non political organizations. Compilation complexity is a closely related notion, which can be seen as a single-round communication complexity.

<text>Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen (; 29 July 1841 – 12 February 1912) was a Norwegian physician, remembered for his identification of the bacterium &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; in 1873 as the causative agent of leprosy. His distinguished work was recognized at the International Leprosy Congress held at Bergen in 1909.

== Life ==
Hansen was born in Bergen, Norway, and attended the Bergen Cathedral School. He worked at Rikshospitalet in Christiania (now Oslo) and as a doctor in Lofoten. In 1868 Hansen returned to Bergen to study leprosy while working at Lungegård Hospital () with Daniel Cornelius Danielssen, a noted expert.

Leprosy was regarded as largely hereditary or otherwise miasmic in origin. Hansen concluded on the basis of epidemiological studies that leprosy was a specific disease with a specific cause. In 1870–71 Hansen travelled to Bonn and Vienna to gain the training necessary for him to prove his hypothesis. In 1873, he announced the discovery of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; in the tissues of all people with the condition, although he did not identify them as bacteria, and received little support. The discovery was made with a &quot;new and better&quot; microscope.

In 1879 Hansen gave tissue samples to Albert Neisser, who then successfully stained the bacteria and announced his findings in 1880, claiming to have discovered the disease-causing organism. There was some dispute between Neisser and Hansen, Hansen as discoverer of the bacillus and Neisser as identifier of it as the etiological agent. Neisser tried to downplay the assistance of Hansen. Hansen&#x27;s claim was weakened by his failure to produce a pure microbiological culture in an artificial medium, or to prove that the rod-shaped organisms were infectious. Further, Hansen had attempted to infect at least one female patient with the nodular form of leprosy without consent, and although no damage was caused, the case ended up in court and Hansen lost his post at the hospital. The case helped introduce informed consent for medical research in Norway.

Hansen remained medical officer for leprosy in Norway and it was through his efforts that the leprosy acts of 1877 and 1885 were passed, leading to a steady decline of the disease in Norway from 1,800 known cases in 1875 to just 575 cases in 1901.

Hansen had had syphilis since the 1860s but died of heart disease. He was an atheist.

==Women&#x27;s rights==
He was a co-founder and a board member of the Bergen chapter of the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights, led by his sister, prominent women&#x27;s rights advocate .

==Honors==
* Leprosy Museum () at St. Jørgen Hospital in Bergen has been dedicated to Hansen.
* Haukeland University Hospital has established as a research facility operated by the University of Bergen.
* In Jerusalem, a 19th-century leprosarium has borne Hansen&#x27;s name since 1950. It has been reconstructed into an art center while preserving the physician&#x27;s surname in its title.
*Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia under the ministry of Health is named after Hansen. AHRI is a biomedical research institute working in tuberculosis, HIV, malaria, leishmaniasis training, and research.

<doc id="50332" wikidata="Q776" url="?curid=50332" title="Utrecht (province)">
<text>Utrecht (), officially the Province of Utrecht (), is a province of the Netherlands. It is located in the centre of the country, bordering the Eemmeer in the north-east, the province of Gelderland in the east and south-east, the province of South Holland in the west and south-west and the province of North Holland in the north-west and north. The province of Utrecht has a population of about 1,388,000 as of January 2023. With a land area of approximately , it is the second smallest province in the country. Apart from its eponymous capital, major cities and towns in the province are Amersfoort, Houten, IJsselstein, Nieuwegein, Veenendaal and Zeist. The busiest railway station in the Netherlands, Utrecht Centraal, is located in the province of Utrecht.

== History ==
The Bishopric of Utrecht was established in 695 when Saint Willibrord was consecrated bishop of the Frisians at Rome by Pope Sergius I. With the consent of the Frankish ruler, Pippin of Herstal, he settled in an old Roman fort in Utrecht. After Willibrord&#x27;s death the diocese suffered greatly from the incursions of the Vikings. Better times appeared during the reign of the Saxon emperors, who frequently summoned the Bishops of Utrecht to attend the imperial councils and diets. In 1024 the bishops were made Princes of the Holy Roman Empire and the new Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht was formed. In 1122, with the Concordat of Worms, the Emperor&#x27;s right of investiture was annulled, and the cathedral chapter received the right to elect the bishop. It was, however, soon obligated to share this right with the four other collegiate chapters in the city. The Counts of Holland and Guelders, between whose territories the lands of the Bishops of Utrecht lay, also sought to acquire influence over the filling of the episcopal see. This often led to disputes and consequently the Holy See frequently interfered in the election. After the middle of the 14th century the popes repeatedly appointed the bishop directly without regard to the five chapters.

During the Hook and Cod Wars, Utrecht was fought over by forces of the Duke of Burgundy leading to the First Utrecht Civil War (1470–1474) and Second Utrecht Civil War (1481–1483).

In 1527, the Bishop sold his territories, and thus his secular authority, to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and the principality became an integral part of the Habsburg dominions, which already included most other Dutch provinces. The chapters transferred their right of electing the bishop to Charles V and his government, a measure to which Pope Clement VII gave his consent, under political pressure after the Sack of Rome. However, the Habsburg rule did not last long, as Utrecht joined in the Dutch Revolt against Charles&#x27; successor Philip II in 1579, becoming a part of the Dutch Republic.

In World War II, Utrecht was held by German forces until the general capitulation of the Germans in the Netherlands on May 5, 1945. It was occupied by Canadian Allied forces on May 7, 1945. The towns of Oudewater, Woerden, Vianen and Leerdam were transferred from the province of South Holland to Utrecht in 1970, 1989, 2002 and 2019 respectively. In February 2011, Utrecht, together with the provinces of North Holland and Flevoland, showed a desire to investigate the feasibility of a merger between the three provinces. This has been positively received by the Dutch cabinet, for the desire to create one Randstad province has already been mentioned in the coalition agreement. The province of South Holland, part of the Randstad urban area, visioned to be part of the Randstad province, and very much supportive of the idea of a merger into one province, is not named. With or without South Holland, if created, the new province would be the largest in the Netherlands in both area and population.

== Geography ==
In the east of Utrecht lies the Utrecht Hill Ridge (Dutch: Utrechtse Heuvelrug), a chain of hills left as lateral moraine by tongues of glacial ice after the Saline glaciation that preceded the last ice age. Because of the scarcity of nutrients in the fast-draining sandy soil, the greatest part of a landscape that was formerly heath has been planted with pine plantations. The south of the province is a river landscape. The west consists mostly of meadows. In the north are big lakes formed by the digging of peat from bogs formed after the last ice age; these lakes are now popular recreational areas for boating, fishing, and water sports.

=== Nature ===
One of the most attractive natural areas in the province is the Vechtstreek (&quot;Vecht region&quot;), situated on either side of the Vecht river.

An international nature conservation organisation that has settled the head office of its Netherlands branch in this province (at Zeist) is the WWF.

&quot;Natuur en Milieu&quot; (&quot;Nature and Environment&quot;) is a national nature protection organisation whose head office is in this province (at Utrecht city).

<text>Utrecht ( ; ; ) is the fourth-largest city of the Netherlands, as well as the capital and the most populous city of the province of Utrecht. The municipality of Utrecht is located in the eastern part of the Randstad conurbation, in the very centre of mainland Netherlands, and includes Haarzuilens, Vleuten and De Meern. It has a population of 361,699 as of .

Utrecht&#x27;s ancient city centre features many buildings and structures, several dating as far back as the High Middle Ages. It has been the religious centre of the Netherlands since the 8th century. In 1579, the Union of Utrecht was signed in the city to lay the foundations for the Dutch Republic. Utrecht was the most important city in the Netherlands until the Dutch Golden Age, when it was surpassed by Amsterdam as the country&#x27;s cultural centre and most populous city.

Utrecht is home to Utrecht University, the largest university in the Netherlands, as well as several other institutions of higher education. Due to its central position within the country, it is an important hub for both rail and road transport; it has the busiest railway station in the Netherlands, Utrecht Centraal. It has the second-highest number of cultural events in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam. In 2012, Lonely Planet included Utrecht in the top 10 of the world&#x27;s unsung places.

== History ==
===Origins (before 650 CE)===

Although there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the Stone Age (app. 2200 BCE) and settling in the Bronze Age (app. 1800–800 BCE), the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a Roman fortification (&quot;castellum&quot;), probably built in around 50 CE. A series of such fortresses were built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand further north. To consolidate the border, the Limes Germanicus defense line was constructed along the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time traversed a more northern route (now known as the Kromme Rijn) compared to today&#x27;s Rhine flow. These fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 Roman soldiers. Near the fort, settlements grew that housed artisans, traders and soldiers&#x27; wives and children.

In Roman times, the name of the Utrecht fortress was simply &quot;Traiectum&quot;, denoting its location at a possible Rhine crossing. Traiectum became Dutch Trecht; with the U from Old Dutch &quot;uut&quot; (downriver) added to distinguish U-trecht from Maas-tricht, on the river Meuse. In 11th-century official documents, it was Latinized as Ultra Traiectum. Around the year 200, the wooden walls of the fortification were replaced by sturdier tuff stone walls, remnants of which are still to be found below the buildings around Dom Square.

From the middle of the 3rd century, Germanic tribes regularly invaded the Roman territories. After around 275 the Romans could no longer maintain the northern border, and Utrecht was abandoned. Little is known about the period from 270 to 650. Utrecht is first spoken of again several centuries after the Romans left. Under the influence of the growing realms of the Franks, during Dagobert I&#x27;s reign in the 7th century, a church was built within the walls of the Roman fortress. In ongoing border conflicts with the Frisians, this first church was destroyed.

===Centre of Christianity in the Netherlands (650–1579)===

By the mid-7th century, British, English and Irish missionaries set out to convert the Frisians. Pope Sergius I appointed their leader, Saint Willibrordus, as bishop of the Frisians. The tenure of Willibrordus is generally considered to be the beginning of the Bishopric of Utrecht. In 723, the Frankish leader Charles Martel bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of the bishops. From then on Utrecht became one of the most influential seats of power for the Catholic Church in the Netherlands. The archbishops of Utrecht were based at the uneasy northern border of the Carolingian Empire. In addition, the city of Utrecht had competition from the nearby trading centre Dorestad. After the fall of Dorestad around 850, Utrecht became one of the most important cities in the Netherlands. The importance of Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the election of the Utrecht-born Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens as pope in 1522 (the last non-Italian pope before John Paul II).

====Prince-bishops====

When the Frankish rulers established the system of feudalism, the Bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops. The territory of the bishopric not only included the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, &#x27;lower Sticht&#x27;), but also extended to the northeast. The feudal conflict of the Middle Ages heavily affected Utrecht. The prince-bishopric was involved in almost continuous conflicts with the Counts of Holland and the Dukes of Guelders. The Veluwe region was seized by Guelders, but large areas in the modern province of Overijssel remained as the Oversticht.

====Religious buildings====
Several churches and monasteries were built inside, or close to, the city of Utrecht. The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire. The choir and transept were finished from 1320 and were followed then by the ambitious Dom tower. The last part to be constructed was the central nave, from 1420. By that time, however, the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished, the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned flying buttresses could be finished.
Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht: St. Salvator&#x27;s Church (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century. Saint John (Janskerk), originating in 1040; Saint Peter, building started in 1039 and Saint Mary&#x27;s church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives).
Besides these churches, the city housed St. Paul&#x27;s Abbey, the 15th-century beguinage of St. Nicholas, and a 14th-century chapter house of the Teutonic Knights.

Besides these buildings which belonged to the bishopric, an additional four parish churches were constructed in the city: the Jacobikerk (dedicated to Saint James), founded in the 11th century, with the current Gothic church dating back to the 14th century; the Buurkerk (Neighbourhood-church) of the 11th-century parish in the centre of the city; Nicolaichurch (dedicated to Saint Nicholas), from the 12th century, and the 13th-century Geertekerk (dedicated to Saint Gertrude of Nivelles).

====City of Utrecht====
Its location on the banks of the river Rhine allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands. The growing town was granted city rights by Henry V at Utrecht on 2 June 1122. When the main flow of the Rhine moved south, the old bed which still flowed through the heart of the town became ever more canalized; and the wharf system was built as an inner city harbour system. On the wharfs, storage facilities (&quot;werfkelders&quot;) were built, on top of which the main street, including houses, was constructed. The wharfs and the cellars are accessible from a platform at water level with stairs descending from the street level to form a unique structure. The relations between the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy. The bishop, for example dammed the Kromme Rijn at Wijk bij Duurstede to protect his estates from flooding. This threatened shipping for the city and led the city of Utrecht to commission a canal to ensure access to the town for shipping trade: the Vaartse Rijn, connecting Utrecht to the Hollandse IJssel at IJsselstein.

====The end of independence====
In 1528 the bishop lost secular power over both Neder- and Oversticht—which included the city of Utrecht—to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Charles V combined the Seventeen Provinces (the current Benelux and the northern parts of France) as a personal union. This ended the prince-bishopric of Utrecht, as the secular rule was now the lordship of Utrecht, with the religious power remaining with the bishop, although Charles V had gained the right to appoint new bishops. In 1559 the bishopric of Utrecht was raised to archbishopric to make it the religious centre of the Northern ecclesiastical province in the Seventeen Provinces.

The transition from independence to a relatively minor part of a larger union was not easily accepted. To quell uprisings, Charles V struggled to exert his power over the city&#x27;s citizens who had struggled to gain a certain level of independence from the bishops and were not willing to cede this to their new lord. The heavily fortified castle Vredenburg was built to house a large garrison whose main task was to maintain control over the city. The castle would last less than 50 years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the Dutch Revolt.

===Republic of the Netherlands (1579–1806)===

In 1579 the northern seven provinces signed the Union of Utrecht treaty (Dutch: Unie van Utrecht), in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic. In 1580, the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the archbishopric of Utrecht. The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic, shifting the power towards its dominant province Holland. This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht. Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic being about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more so among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.

The fortified city temporarily fell to the French invasion in 1672 (the Disaster Year, Dutch: Rampjaar). The French invasion was stopped just west of Utrecht at the Old Hollandic Waterline. In 1674, only two years after the French left, the centre of Utrecht was struck by a tornado. The halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the cathedral of St Martin church&#x27;s central section which collapsed, creating the current Dom square between the tower and choir. In 1713, Utrecht hosted one of the first international peace negotiations when the Treaty of Utrecht settled the War of the Spanish Succession. Beginning in 1723, Utrecht became the centre of the non-Roman Old Catholic Churches in the world.

===Modern history (1815–present)===

In the early 19th century, the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete. The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network. With the Industrial Revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond its medieval centre. When the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome in 1853, Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward, neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle-class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schröder House (1924), and Dudok&#x27;s construction of the city theatre (1941).
During World War II, Utrecht was held by German forces until the general German surrender of the Netherlands on 5 May 1945. British and Canadian troops that had surrounded the city entered it after that surrender, on 7 May 1945. Following the end of World War II, the city grew considerably when new neighbourhoods such as Overvecht, Kanaleneiland, and Lunetten were built. Around 2000, the Leidsche Rijn housing area was developed as an extension of the city to the west.

The area surrounding Utrecht Centraal railway station and the station itself were developed following modernist ideas of the 1960s, in a brutalist style. This development led to the construction of the shopping mall , the music centre Vredenburg (Hertzberger, 1979), and conversion of part of the ancient canal structure into a highway (Catherijnebaan). Protest against further modernisation of the city centre followed even before the last buildings were finalised. In the early 21st century, the whole area is undergoing change again. The redeveloped music centre TivoliVredenburg opened in 2014 with the original Vredenburg and Tivoli concert and rock and jazz halls brought together in a single building. 

==Geography==

===Climate===
Utrecht experiences a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to all of the Netherlands.

== Population ==
=== Demographics ===
Utrecht city had a population of 361,924 in 2022. It is a growing municipality and projections are that the population will surpass 392,000 by 2025. As of November 2019, the city of Utrecht has a population of 357,179.

Utrecht has a young population, with many inhabitants in the age category from 20 and 30 years, due to the presence of a large university. About 52% of the population is female, 48% is male. The majority of households (52.5%) in Utrecht are single-person households. About 29% of people living in Utrecht are either married, or have another legal partnership. About 3% of the population of Utrecht is divorced.

=== Inhabitants by origin ===
For 62.8% of the population of Utrecht both parents were born in the Netherlands. Approximately 12.4% of the population consists of people with a recent migration background from Western countries, while 24.8% of the population has at least one parent who is of &#x27;non-Western origin&#x27; (8.8% from Morocco, 4% Turkey, 3% Surinam and Dutch Caribbean and 9.1% of other countries). 

=== Religion ===
Utrecht has been the religious centre of the Netherlands since the 8th century. Currently it is the see of the Metropolitan Archbishop of Utrecht, the most senior Dutch Roman Catholic leader. His ecclesiastical province covers the whole kingdom.

Utrecht is also the see of the archbishop of the Old Catholic Church, titular head of the Union of Utrecht, and the location of the offices of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, the main Dutch Protestant church.

As of 2013, the largest religion is Christianity with 28% of the population being Christian, followed by Islam with 9.9% in 2016 and Hinduism with 0.8%.

===Population centres and agglomeration===
The city of Utrecht is subdivided into 10 city quarters, all of which have their own neighbourhood council and service centre for civil affairs.

# Binnenstad 
# Oost 
# Leidsche Rijn 
# West 
# Overvecht 
# Zuid 
# Noordoost 
# Zuidwest 
# Noordwest 
# Vleuten-De Meern

Utrecht is the centre of a densely populated area, a fact which makes concise definitions of its agglomeration difficult, and somewhat arbitrary. The smaller Utrecht agglomeration of continuously built-up areas counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes Nieuwegein, IJsselstein and Maarssen. It is sometimes argued that the close by municipalities De Bilt, Zeist, Houten, Vianen, Driebergen-Rijsenburg (Utrechtse Heuvelrug), and Bunnik should also be counted towards the Utrecht agglomeration, bringing the total to 640,000 inhabitants. The larger region, including slightly more remote cities such as Woerden and Amersfoort, counts up to 820,000 inhabitants.

== Cityscape ==

Utrecht&#x27;s cityscape is dominated by the Dom Tower, the tallest belfry in the Netherlands and originally part of the Cathedral of Saint Martin. An ongoing debate is over whether any building in or near the centre of town should surpass the Dom Tower in height (). Nevertheless, some tall buildings are now being constructed that will become part of the skyline of Utrecht. The second-tallest building of the city, the Rabobank-tower, was completed in 2010 and stands tall. Two antennas will increase that height to . Two other buildings were constructed around the Nieuw Galgenwaard stadium (2007). These buildings, the &#x27;Kantoortoren Galghenwert&#x27; and &#x27;Apollo Residence&#x27;, stand and high, respectively.
The former Utrecht Main Post Office, built in 1924, is still in the city centre at Neude square, but is now serving as library, see also Utrecht Post Office.

Another landmark is the old centre and the canal structure in the inner city. The Oudegracht is a curved canal, partly following the ancient main branch of the Rhine. It is lined with the unique wharf-basement structures that create a two-level street along the canals. The inner city has largely retained its medieval structure, and the moat ringing the old town is largely intact. In the 1970s part of the moat was converted into a motorway. It was then converted back into a waterway, the work being finished in 2020.

Because of the role of Utrecht as a fortified city, construction outside the medieval centre and its city walls was restricted until the 19th century. Surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late-19th- and early-20th-century neighbourhoods, with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out. The eastern part of Utrecht remains fairly open. The Dutch Water Line, moved east of the city in the early 19th century, required open lines of fire, thus prohibiting all permanent constructions until the middle of the 20th century on the east side of the city.

Due to the past importance of Utrecht as a religious centre, several monumental churches were erected, many of which have survived. Most prominent is the Dom Church. Other notable churches include the romanesque St Peter&#x27;s and St John&#x27;s churches; the gothic churches of St James and St Nicholas; and the Buurkerk, now converted into a museum for automatically playing musical instruments.

==Transport==
===Public transport===
Because of its central location, Utrecht is well connected to the rest of the Netherlands and has a well-developed public transport network.

====Heavy rail====

Utrecht Centraal is the main railway station of Utrecht and is the largest in the country. There are regular intercity services to all major Dutch cities, including direct services to Schiphol Airport. Utrecht Centraal is a station on the night service, providing an all-night service to (among others) Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, seven days a week. International InterCityExpress (ICE) services to Germany through Arnhem call at Utrecht Centraal. Regular local trains to all areas surrounding Utrecht also depart from Utrecht Centraal; and service several smaller stations: Utrecht Lunetten; Utrecht Vaartsche Rijn; Utrecht Overvecht; Utrecht Leidsche Rijn; Utrecht Terwijde; Utrecht Zuilen and Vleuten. A former station Utrecht Maliebaan closed in 1939 and has since been converted into the Dutch Railway Museum.

Utrecht is the location of the headquarters of Nederlandse Spoorwegen (English: &quot;Dutch Railways&quot;), the largest rail operator in the Netherlands, and ProRail, the state-owned company responsible for the construction and maintenance of the country&#x27;s rail infrastructure.

====Light rail====
The Utrecht sneltram is a light rail system with three routes connecting Utrecht Centraal railway station to the suburbs of IJsselstein and Nieuwegein and to the Uithof district. The sneltram began operations in 1983 and is currently operated under the U-OV brand by the private transport company Qbuzz. The system has a total length 18.3 km and 54 trainsets. It carried over 9 million riders in 2023.

Utrecht is the only city among the four largest in the Netherlands (the others being Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam) that awards a public transportation concession by tender. Qbuzz will hold that concession until December 2025 after which Transdev will take it over until 2035.

====Bus transport====
Utrecht Centraal railway station also serves local and regional buses at its west side (Centrumzijde) and at its east side (Jaarbuursplein), where both sides have connections to the Utrecht sneltram. Fifty local bus routes are operated by Qbuzz under the U-OV brand until December 2025 when Transdev will take over the concession. The local bus fleet is one of Europe&#x27;s cleanest, using only buses compliant with the Euro-VI standard as well as electric buses for inner-city transport. The plan is that all buses be zero-emmission by 2028. Regional buses from the city are operated by Arriva.

The Utrecht Centraal railway station is also served by the pan-European services of Eurolines. Furthermore, it acts as departure and arrival place of many coach companies serving holiday resorts in Spain and France—and during winter in Austria and Switzerland.

===Cycling===
Like most Dutch cities, Utrecht has an extensive network of cycle paths, making cycling safe and popular. 51% of journeys within the city are by bicycle, more than any other mode of transport. (Cars, for example, account for 30% of trips). Bicycles are used by young and old people, and by individuals and families. They are mostly traditional, upright, steel-framed bicycles, with few gears. There are also bucket bikes for carrying cargo such as groceries or small children. Thanks in part to the access provided by bicycles, 100% of the population lives in a 15-minute city and more than 90% can get to the major destination types within 10 minutes. 

In 2014, the city council decided to build the world&#x27;s largest bicycle parking station, near the Central Railway Station. This three-floor construction cost over €30 million and can hold 12,500 bicycles. The bicycle parking station was built in stages, with the first part opening in August 2017, and the final section (after some delay) being opened on 19 August 2019.

===Road transport===
Utrecht is well-connected to the Dutch road network. Two of the most important major roads serve the city of Utrecht: the A12 and A2 motorways connect Amsterdam, Arnhem, The Hague and Maastricht, as well as Belgium and Germany. Other major motorways in the area are the Almere–Breda A27 and the Utrecht–Groningen A28. Due to the increasing traffic and the ancient city plan, traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around Utrecht, causing elevated levels of air pollutants. This has led to a passionate debate in the city about the best way to improve the city&#x27;s air quality.

===Shipping===
Utrecht has an industrial port located on the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. The container terminal has a capacity of 80,000 containers a year. In 2003, the port facilitated the transport of four million tons of cargo; mostly sand, gravel, fertiliser and fodder. Additionally, some tourist boat trips are organised from various places on the Oudegracht; and the city is connected to touristic shipping routes through sluices.

==Economy==
Production industry constitutes a small part of the economy of Utrecht. The economy of Utrecht depends for a large part on the several large institutions located in the city. It is the centre of the Dutch railway network and the location of the head office of Nederlandse Spoorwegen. ProRail is headquartered in &quot;&quot; (The Inkwell), the largest brick building in the Netherlands (the &quot;UFO&quot; featured on its façade stems from an art program in 2000). Rabobank, a large bank, has its headquarters in Utrecht.

Utrecht is also informally considered the &quot;capital&quot; of the Dutch games industry. It was named by Business Finland in 2023 as one of several capitals for the European games industry as a whole. Utrecht&#x27;s influence in this field was caused by video game development courses at its universities, which were the first such courses in Europe when launched in 2002. Since 2008 Utrecht has also been home to the studio incubator program Dutch Game Garden, which has launched a number of studios in the area. By 2014 the program had created 200 jobs. Utrecht is also home to Nixxes Software (a PlayStation Studios subsidiary) as well as Sokpop Collective.

==Education==
Utrecht hosts several large institutions of higher education. The most prominent of these is Utrecht University (est. 1636), the largest university of the Netherlands with 30,449 students (). The university is partially based in the inner city as well as in the Uithof campus area, on the east side of the city. According to Shanghai Jiaotong University&#x27;s university ranking in 2014, it is the 57th-best university in the world. Utrecht also houses the much smaller University of Humanistic Studies, which houses about 400 students.

Utrecht is home of one of the locations of TIAS School for Business and Society, focused on post-experience management education and the largest management school of its kind in the Netherlands. In 2008, its executive MBA program was rated the 24th best program in the world by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

Utrecht is also home to two other large institutions of higher education: the vocational university Hogeschool Utrecht (37,000 students), with locations in the city and the Uithof campus; and the HKU Utrecht School of the Arts (3,000 students).

There are many schools for primary and secondary education, allowing parents to select from different philosophies and religions in the school as is inherent in the Dutch school system.

==Culture==


Utrecht city has an active cultural life, and in the Netherlands is second only to Amsterdam. There are several theatres and theatre companies. The 1941 main city theatre was built by Dudok. In addition to theatres, there is a large number of cinemas including three arthouse cinemas. Utrecht is host to the international Early Music Festival (Festival Oude Muziek, for music before 1800) and the Netherlands Film Festival. The city has an important classical music hall Vredenburg (1979 by Herman Hertzberger). Its acoustics are considered among the best of the 20th-century original music halls. The original Vredenburg music hall has been redeveloped as part of the larger station area redevelopment plan and in 2014 gained additional halls that allowed its merger with the rock club Tivoli and the SJU jazzpodium. There are several other venues for music throughout the city. Young musicians are educated in the conservatory, a department of the Utrecht School of the Arts. There is a specialised museum of automatically playing musical instruments.

There are many art galleries in Utrecht. There are also several foundations to support art and artists. Training of artists is done at the Utrecht School of the Arts. The Centraal Museum has many exhibitions on the arts, including a permanent exhibition on the works of Utrecht resident illustrator Dick Bruna, who is best known for creating Miffy (&quot;Nijntje&quot;, in Dutch). BAK, [Dutch: &quot;Basis voor Actuele Kunst,&quot; Basis for Contemporary Art] offers contemporary art exhibitions and public events, as well as a Fellowship program for practitioners involved in contemporary arts, theory and activisms. Although street art is illegal in Utrecht, the Utrechtse Kabouter, a picture of a gnome with a red hat, became a common sight in 2004. Utrecht also houses one of the landmarks of modern architecture, the 1924 Rietveld Schröder House, which is listed on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites.

Every Saturday, a paviour adds another letter to &quot;The Letters of Utrecht&quot;, an endless poem in the cobblestones of the Oude Gracht in Utrecht. With the &quot;Letters&quot;, Utrecht has a social sculpture as a growing monument created for the benefit of future people.

To promote culture, Utrecht city organizes cultural Sundays. During a thematic Sunday, several organisations create a program which is open to everyone without, or with a substantially reduced, admission fee. There are also initiatives for amateur artists. The city subsidises an organisation for amateur education in arts aimed at all inhabitants (Utrechts Centrum voor de Kunsten), as does the university for its staff and students. Additionally there are also several private initiatives. The city council provides coupons for discounts to inhabitants who receive welfare to be used with many of the initiatives.

In 2017, Utrecht was named as a UNESCO City of Literature. In 2025 the national literature museum will move from the Hague to Utrecht.

<text>John Charlton Polkinghorne (16 October 1930 – 9 March 2021) was an English theoretical physicist, theologian, and Anglican priest. A prominent and leading voice explaining the relationship between science and religion, he was professor of mathematical physics at the University of Cambridge from 1968 to 1979, when he resigned his chair to study for the priesthood, becoming an ordained Anglican priest in 1982. He served as the president of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, from 1988 until 1996.

Polkinghorne was the author of five books on physics and twenty-six on the relationship between science and religion; his publications include &quot;The Quantum World&quot; (1989), &quot;Quantum Physics and Theology: An Unexpected Kinship&quot; (2005), &quot;Exploring Reality: The Intertwining of Science and Religion&quot; (2007), and &quot;Questions of Truth&quot; (2009). &quot;The Polkinghorne Reader&quot; (edited by Thomas Jay Oord) provides key excerpts from Polkinghorne&#x27;s most influential books. He was knighted in 1997 and in 2002 received the £1-million Templeton Prize, awarded for exceptional contributions to affirming life&#x27;s spiritual dimension.

==Early life and education==
Polkinghorne was born in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset on 16 October 1930 to Dorothy Charlton, the daughter of a groom and George Polkinghorne, who worked for the post office. John was the couple&#x27;s third child. He had a brother, Peter, and a sister, Ann, who died when she was six, one month before John&#x27;s birth. Peter died in 1942 while flying for the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

He was educated at the local primary school in Street, Somerset, then was taught by a friend of the family at home, and later at a Quaker school. When he was 11 he went to Elmhurst Grammar School in Street, and when his father was promoted to head postmaster in Ely in 1945, Polkinghorne was transferred to The Perse School, Cambridge. Following National Service in the Royal Army Educational Corps from 1948 to 1949, he read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1952 as Senior Wrangler, then earned his PhD in physics in 1955, supervised by the Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in the group led by Paul Dirac.

==Career==
===Physics===
Polkinghorne joined the Christian Union of UCCF while at Cambridge and met his future wife, Ruth Martin, another member of the union and also a mathematics student. They married on 26 March 1955, and at the end of that year sailed from Liverpool to New York. Polkinghorne accepted a postdoctoral Harkness Fellowship with the California Institute of Technology, where he worked with Murray Gell-Mann. Toward the end of the fellowship he was offered a position as lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, which he took up in 1956.

After two years in Scotland, he returned to teach at Cambridge in 1958. He was promoted to reader in 1965, and in 1968 was offered a professorship in mathematical physics, a position he held until 1979, his students including Brian Josephson and Martin Rees. For 25 years, he worked on theories about elementary particles, played a role in the discovery of the quark, and researched the analytic and high-energy properties of Feynman integrals and the foundations of S-matrix theory. While employed by Cambridge, he also spent time at Princeton, Berkeley, Stanford, and at CERN in Geneva. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974.

===Priesthood and Queens&#x27; College===
Polkinghorne decided to train for the priesthood in 1977. He said in an interview that he felt he had done his bit for science after 25 years, and that his best mathematical work was probably behind him; Christianity had always been central to his life, so ordination offered an attractive second career. He resigned his chair in 1979 to study at Westcott House, Cambridge, an Anglican theological college, becoming an ordained priest on 6 June 1982 (Trinity Sunday). The ceremony was held at Trinity College, Cambridge, and presided over by Bishop John A. T. Robinson. He worked for five years as a curate in south Bristol, then as vicar in Blean, Kent, before returning to Cambridge in 1986 as dean of chapel at Trinity Hall. He became the president of Queens&#x27; College that year, a position he held until his retirement in 1996. He served as canon theologian of Liverpool Cathedral from 1994 to 2005. Polkinghorne died on 9 March 2021 at the age of 90.

===Awards===
In 1997 Polkinghorne was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), although as an ordained priest in the Church of England, he was not styled as &quot;Sir John Polkinghorne&quot;. He was an honorary fellow of St Chad&#x27;s College, Durham, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Durham in 1998; and in 2002 was awarded the Templeton Prize for his contributions to research at the interface between science and religion. He spoke on &quot;The Universe as Creation&quot; at the Trotter Prize ceremony in 2003.

He has been a member of the BMA Medical Ethics Committee, the General Synod of the Church of England, the Doctrine Commission, and the Human Genetics Commission. He served as chairman of the governors of The Perse School from 1972 to 1981. He was a fellow of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, and was for 10 years a canon theologian of Liverpool Cathedral. He was a founding member of the Society of Ordained Scientists and also of the International Society for Science and Religion, of which he was the first president. He was selected to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures in 1993–1994, which he later published as &quot;The Faith of a Physicist&quot;.

In 2006 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Hong Kong Baptist University as part of their 50-year celebrations. This included giving a public lecture on &quot;The Dialogue between Science and Religion and Its Significance for the Academy&quot; and an &quot;East–West Dialogue&quot; with Yang Chen-Ning, a Nobel laureate in physics. He was a member of staff of the Psychology and Religion Research Group at Cambridge University. He was an honorary fellow of St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Ideas==
Polkinghorne said in an interview that he believes his move from science to religion has given him binocular vision, though he understands that it has aroused the kind of suspicion &quot;that might follow the claim to be a vegetarian butcher.&quot; He describes his position as critical realism and believes that science and religion address aspects of the same reality. It is a consistent theme of his work that when he &quot;turned his collar around&quot; he did not stop seeking truth. He argues there are five points of comparison between the ways in which science and theology pursue truth: moments of enforced radical revision, a period of unresolved confusion, new synthesis and understanding, continued wrestling with unresolved problems, deeper implications.

He suggests that the mechanistic explanations of the world that have continued from Laplace to Richard Dawkins should be replaced by an understanding that most of nature is cloud-like rather than clock-like. He regards the mind, soul and body as different aspects of the same underlying reality — &quot;dual aspect monism&quot; — writing that &quot;there is only one stuff in the world (not two — the material and the mental), but it can occur in two contrasting states (material and mental phases, a physicist might say) which explain our perception of the difference between mind and matter.&quot; He believes that standard physical causation cannot adequately describe the manifold ways in which things and people interact, and uses the phrase &quot;active information&quot; to describe how, when several outcomes are possible, there may be higher levels of causation that choose which one occurs.

Sometimes Christianity seems to him to be just too good to be true, but when this sort of doubt arises he says to himself, &quot;All right then, deny it&quot;, and writes that he knows this is something he could never do.

===On the existence of God===
Polkinghorne considers that &quot;the question of the existence of God is the single most important question we face about the nature of reality&quot; and quotes, with approval, Sir Anthony Kenny: &quot;After all, if there is no God, then God is incalculably the greatest single creation of the human imagination.&quot; He addresses the questions of &quot;Does the concept of God make sense? If so, do we have reason for believing in such a thing?&quot; He is &quot;cautious about our powers to assess coherence&quot;, pointing out that in 1900 a &quot;competent… undergraduate could have demonstrated the &#x27;incoherence&#x27;&quot; of quantum ideas. He suggests that &quot;the nearest analogy in the physical world [to God] would be… the Quantum Vacuum.&quot;

He suggests that God is the ultimate answer to Leibniz&#x27;s great question &quot;why is there something rather than nothing?&quot; The atheist&#x27;s &quot;plain assertion of the world&#x27;s existence&quot; is a &quot;grossly impoverished view of reality… [arguing that] theism explains more than a reductionist atheism can ever address.&quot;. 

He is very doubtful of St Anselm&#x27;s Ontological Argument. Referring to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, he said: &quot;If we cannot prove the consistency of arithmetic it seems a bit much to hope that God&#x27;s existence is easier to deal with,&quot; concluding that God is &quot;ontologically necessary, but not logically necessary.&quot; He &quot;does not assert that God&#x27;s existence can be demonstrated in a logically coercive way (any more than God&#x27;s non-existence can) but that theism makes more sense of the world, and of human experience, than does atheism.&quot; He cites in particular:

* The intelligibility of the universe: One would anticipate that evolutionary selection would produce hominid minds apt for coping with everyday experience, but that these minds should also be able to understand the subatomic world and general relativity goes far beyond anything of relevance to survival fitness. The mystery deepens when one recognises the proven fruitfulness of mathematical beauty as a guide to successful theory choice.
* The anthropic fine tuning of the universe: He quotes with approval Freeman Dyson, who said &quot;the more I examine the universe and the details of its architecture, the more evidence I find that the universe in some sense must have known we were coming&quot; and suggests there is a wide consensus amongst physicists that either there are a very large number of other universes in the Multiverse or that &quot;there is just one universe which is the way it is in its anthropic fruitfulness because it is the expression of the purposive design of a Creator, who has endowed it with the finely tuned potentialty for life.&quot;
* A wider humane reality: He considers that theism offers a more persuasive account of ethical and aesthetic perceptions. He argues that it is difficult to accommodate the idea that &quot;we have real moral knowledge&quot; and that statements such as &#x27;torturing children is wrong&#x27; are more than &quot;simply social conventions of the societies within which they are uttered&quot; within an atheistic or naturalistic world view. He also believes such a world view finds it hard to explain how &quot;Something of lasting significance is glimpsed in the beauty of the natural world and the beauty of the fruits of human creativity.&quot;

===On free will===
Polkinghorne believes that 
===On creationism===
Following the resignation of Michael Reiss, the director of education at the Royal Society—who had controversially argued that school pupils who believed in creationism should be used by science teachers to start discussions, rather than be rejected &quot;per se&quot; — Polkinghorne argued in &quot;The Times&quot; that &quot;As a Christian believer I am, of course, a creationist in the proper sense of the term, for I believe that the mind and the purpose of a divine Creator lie behind the fruitful history and remarkable order of the universe which science explores. But I am certainly not a creationist in that curious North American sense, which implies interpreting Genesis 1 in a flat-footed literal way and supposing that evolution is wrong.&quot;

===Critical reception===
Nancy Frankenberry, Professor of Religion at Dartmouth College, has described Polkinghorne as the finest British theologian/scientist of our time, citing his work on the possible relationship between chaos theory and natural theology. Owen Gingerich, an astronomer and former Harvard professor, has called him a leading voice on the relationship between science and religion.

The British philosopher Simon Blackburn has criticized Polkinghorne for using primitive thinking and rhetorical devices instead of engaging in philosophy. When Polkinghorne argues that the minute adjustments of cosmological constants for life points towards an explanation beyond the scientific realm, Blackburn argues that this relies on a natural preference for explanation in terms of agency. Blackburn writes that he finished Polkinghorne&#x27;s books in &quot;despair at humanity&#x27;s capacity for self-deception.&quot; Against this, Freeman Dyson called Polkinghorne&#x27;s arguments on theology and natural science &quot;polished and logically coherent.&quot; The novelist Simon Ings, writing in the &quot;New Scientist&quot;, said Polkinghorne&#x27;s argument for the proposition that God is real is cogent and his evidence elegant.

Richard Dawkins, formerly Professor for Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, writes that the same three names of British scientists who are also sincerely religious crop up with the &quot;likable familiarity of senior partners in a firm of Dickensian lawyers&quot;: Arthur Peacocke, Russell Stannard, and John Polkinghorne, all of whom have either won the Templeton Prize or are on its board of trustees. Dawkins writes that he is not so much bewildered by their belief in a cosmic lawgiver, but by their beliefs in the minutiae of Christianity, such as the resurrection and forgiveness of sins, and that such scientists, in Britain and in the US, are the subject of bemused bafflement among their peers. Polkinghorne responded that &quot;debating with Dawkins is hopeless, because there&#x27;s no give and take. He doesn&#x27;t give you an inch. He just says no when you say yes.&quot; Nicholas Beale writes in &quot;Questions of Truth&quot;, which he co-authored with Polkinghorne, that he hopes Dawkins will be a bit less baffled once he reads it.

A. C. Grayling criticized the Royal Society for allowing its premises to be used in connection with the launch of &quot;Questions of Truth&quot;, describing it as a scandal, and suggesting that Polkinghorne had exploited his fellowship there to publicize a &quot;weak, casuistical and tendentious pamphlet.&quot; After implying that the book&#x27;s publisher, Westminster John Knox, was a self-publisher, Grayling went on to write that Polkinghorne and others were eager to see the credibility accorded to scientific research extended to religious perspectives through association.

In contrast to Grayling, science historian Edward B. Davis praises &quot;Questions of Truth&quot;, saying the book provides &quot;the kind of technical information… that scientifically trained readers will appreciate—yet they can be read profitably by anyone interested in science and Christianity.&quot; Davis concludes, &quot;It hasn&#x27;t been easy to steer a middle course between fundamentalism and modernism, particularly on issues involving science. Polkinghorne has done that very successfully for a generation, and for this he ought to be both appreciated and emulated.&quot;

==Published works==

Polkinghorne wrote 34 books, translated into 18 languages; 26 concern science and religion, often for a popular audience.

<doc id="50337" wikidata="Q122043" url="?curid=50337" title="Fructose">
<text>Fructose (), or fruit sugar, is a ketonic simple sugar found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed by the gut directly into the blood of the portal vein during digestion. The liver then converts most fructose and galactose into glucose for distribution in the bloodstream or deposition into glycogen. 

Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name &quot;fructose&quot; was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Allen Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid, and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.

Commercially, fructose is derived from sugar cane, sugar beets, and maize. High-fructose corn syrup is a mixture of glucose and fructose as monosaccharides. Sucrose is a compound with one molecule of glucose covalently linked to one molecule of fructose. All forms of fructose, including those found in fruits and juices, are commonly added to foods and drinks for palatability and taste enhancement, and for browning of some foods, such as baked goods. As of 2004, about 240,000 tonnes of crystalline fructose were being produced annually.

Excessive consumption of sugars, including fructose, (especially from sugar-sweetened beverages) may contribute to insulin resistance, obesity, elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, leading to metabolic syndrome. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated in 2011 that fructose may be preferable over sucrose and glucose in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages because of its lower effect on postprandial blood sugar levels, while also noting the potential downside that &quot;high intakes of fructose may lead to metabolic complications such as dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and increased visceral adiposity&quot;. The UK&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in 2015 disputed the claims of fructose causing metabolic disorders, stating that &quot;there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that fructose intake, at levels consumed in the normal UK diet, leads to adverse health outcomes independent of any effects related to its presence as a component of total and free sugars.&quot;

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;fructose&quot; was coined in 1857 from the Latin for &quot;fructus&quot; (fruit) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars, &quot;-ose&quot;. It is also called fruit sugar and levulose or laevulose, due to its ability to rotate plane polarised light in a laevorotary fashion (anti-clockwise/to the left) when a beam is shone through it in solution. Likewise, dextrose (an isomer of glucose) is given its name due to its ability to rotate plane polarised light in a dextrorotary fashion (clockwise/to the right).

== Chemical properties ==

Fructose is a 6-carbon polyhydroxyketone. Crystalline fructose adopts a cyclic six-membered structure, called β--fructopyranose, owing to the stability of its hemiketal and internal hydrogen-bonding. In solution, fructose exists as an equilibrium mixture of the tautomers β--fructopyranose, β--fructofuranose, α--fructofuranose, α--fructopyranose and &quot;keto&quot;--fructose (the non-cyclic form).

The distribution of -fructose tautomers in solution is related to several variables, such as solvent and temperature. -Fructopyranose and -fructofuranose distributions in water have been identified multiple times as roughly 70% fructopyranose and 22% fructofuranose.

=== Reactions ===

==== Fructose and fermentation ====
Fructose may be anaerobically fermented by yeast and bacteria. Yeast enzymes convert sugar (sucrose, glucose, and fructose, but not lactose) to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Some of the carbon dioxide produced during fermentation will remain dissolved in water, where it will reach equilibrium with carbonic acid. The dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid produce the carbonation in some fermented beverages, such as champagne.

==== Fructose and Maillard reaction ====
Fructose undergoes the Maillard reaction, non-enzymatic browning, with amino acids. Because fructose exists to a greater extent in the open-chain form than does glucose, the initial stages of the Maillard reaction occur more rapidly than with glucose. Therefore, fructose has potential to contribute to changes in food palatability, as well as other nutritional effects, such as excessive browning, volume and tenderness reduction during cake preparation, and formation of mutagenic compounds.
==== Dehydration ====
Fructose readily dehydrates to give hydroxymethylfurfural (&quot;HMF&quot;, ), which can be processed into liquid dimethylfuran ().
This process, in the future, may become part of a low-cost, carbon-neutral system to produce replacements for petrol and diesel from plants.

== Physical and functional properties ==

=== Sweetness of fructose ===

The primary reason that fructose is used commercially in foods and beverages, besides its low cost, is its high relative sweetness. It is the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates. The relative sweetness of fructose has been reported in the range of 1.2–1.8 times that of sucrose. However, it is the 6-membered ring form of fructose that is sweeter; the 5-membered ring form tastes about the same as usual table sugar. Warming fructose leads to formation of the 5-membered ring form. Therefore, the relative sweetness decreases with increasing temperature. However, it has been observed that the absolute sweetness of fructose is identical at 5 °C as 50 °C and thus the relative sweetness to sucrose is not due to anomeric distribution but a decrease in the absolute sweetness of sucrose at higher temperatures.

The sweetness of fructose is perceived earlier than that of sucrose or glucose, and the taste sensation reaches a peak (higher than that of sucrose), and diminishes more quickly than that of sucrose. Fructose can also enhance other flavors in the system.

Fructose exhibits a sweetness synergy effect when used in combination with other sweeteners. The relative sweetness of fructose blended with sucrose, aspartame, or saccharin is perceived to be greater than the sweetness calculated from individual components.

=== Fructose solubility and crystallization ===
Fructose has higher water solubility than other sugars, as well as other sugar alcohols. Fructose is, therefore, difficult to crystallize from an aqueous solution. Sugar mixes containing fructose, such as candies, are softer than those containing other sugars because of the greater solubility of fructose.

=== Fructose hygroscopicity and humectancy ===
Fructose is quicker to absorb moisture and slower to release it to the environment than sucrose, glucose, or other nutritive sweeteners. Fructose is an excellent humectant and retains moisture for a long period of time even at low relative humidity (RH). Therefore, fructose can contribute a more palatable texture, and longer shelf life to the food products in which it is used.

=== Freezing point ===
Fructose has a greater effect on freezing point depression than disaccharides or oligosaccharides, which may protect the integrity of cell walls of fruit by reducing ice crystal formation. However, this characteristic may be undesirable in soft-serve or hard-frozen dairy desserts.

=== Fructose and starch functionality in food systems ===
Fructose increases starch viscosity more rapidly and achieves a higher final viscosity than sucrose because fructose lowers the temperature required during gelatinizing of starch, causing a greater final viscosity.

Although some artificial sweeteners are not suitable for home baking, many traditional recipes use fructose.

== Food sources ==

Natural sources of fructose include fruits, vegetables (including sugar cane), and honey. Fructose is often further concentrated from these sources. The highest dietary sources of fructose, besides pure crystalline fructose, are foods containing white sugar (sucrose), high-fructose corn syrup, agave nectar, honey, molasses, maple syrup, fruit and fruit juices, as these have the highest percentages of fructose (including fructose in sucrose) per serving compared to other common foods and ingredients. Fructose exists in foods either as a free monosaccharide or bound to glucose as sucrose, a disaccharide. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose may all be present in food; however, different foods will have varying levels of each of these three sugars.

The sugar contents of common fruits and vegetables are presented in Table 1. In general, in foods that contain free fructose, the ratio of fructose to glucose is approximately 1:1; that is, foods with fructose usually contain about an equal amount of free glucose. A value that is above 1 indicates a higher proportion of fructose to glucose and below 1 a lower proportion. Some fruits have larger proportions of fructose to glucose compared to others. For example, apples and pears contain more than twice as much free fructose as glucose, while for apricots the proportion is less than half as much fructose as glucose.

Apple and pear juices are of particular interest to pediatricians because the high concentrations of free fructose in these juices can cause diarrhea in children. The cells (enterocytes) that line children&#x27;s small intestines have less affinity for fructose absorption than for glucose and sucrose. Unabsorbed fructose creates higher osmolarity in the small intestine, which draws water into the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in osmotic diarrhea. This phenomenon is discussed in greater detail in the Health Effects section.

Table 1 also shows the amount of sucrose found in common fruits and vegetables. Sugarcane and sugar beet have a high concentration of sucrose, and are used for commercial preparation of pure sucrose. Extracted cane or beet juice is clarified, removing impurities; and concentrated by removing excess water. The end product is 99.9%-pure sucrose. Sucrose-containing sugars include common white sugar and powdered sugar, as well as brown sugar.
: The carbohydrate figure is calculated in FoodData Central and does not always correspond to the sum of the sugars, the starch, and the &quot;dietary fiber&quot;.

All data with a unit of g (gram) are based on 100 g of a food item.
The fructose/glucose ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of free fructose plus half sucrose by the sum of free glucose plus half sucrose.

Fructose is also found in the manufactured sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is produced by treating corn syrup with enzymes, converting glucose into fructose. The common designations for fructose content, HFCS-42 and HFCS-55, indicate the percentage of fructose present in HFCS. HFCS-55 is commonly used as a sweetener for soft drinks, whereas HFCS-42 is used to sweeten processed foods, breakfast cereals, bakery foods, and some soft drinks.

=== Carbohydrate content of commercial sweeteners (percent on dry basis) ===

 for HFCS, and USDA for fruits and vegetables and the other refined sugars.

Cane and beet sugars have been used as the major sweetener in food manufacturing for centuries. However, with the development of HFCS, a significant shift occurred in the type of sweetener consumption in certain countries, particularly the United States. Contrary to the popular belief, however, with the increase of HFCS consumption, the total fructose intake relative to the total glucose intake has not dramatically changed. Granulated sugar is 99.9%-pure sucrose, which means that it has equal ratio of fructose to glucose. The most commonly used forms of HFCS, HFCS-42, and HFCS-55, have a roughly equal ratio of fructose to glucose, with minor differences. HFCS has simply replaced sucrose as a sweetener. Therefore, despite the changes in the sweetener consumption, the ratio of glucose to fructose intake has remained relatively constant.

===Nutritional information===
Providing 368 kcal per 100 grams of dry powder (table), fructose has 95% the caloric value of sucrose by weight. Fructose powder is 100% carbohydrates and supplies no other nutrients in significant amount (table).

== Fructose digestion and absorption in humans ==

Fructose exists in foods either as a monosaccharide (free fructose) or as a unit of a disaccharide (sucrose). Free fructose is a ketonic simple sugar and one of the three dietary monosaccharides absorbed directly by the intestine. When fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose, it is digested (broken down) and then absorbed as free fructose. As sucrose comes into contact with the membrane of the small intestine, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the cleavage of sucrose to yield one glucose unit and one fructose unit, which are then each absorbed. After absorption, it enters the hepatic portal vein and is directed toward the liver.

The mechanism of fructose absorption in the small intestine is not completely understood. Some evidence suggests active transport, because fructose uptake has been shown to occur against a concentration gradient. However, the majority of research supports the claim that fructose absorption occurs on the mucosal membrane via facilitated transport involving GLUT5 transport proteins. Since the concentration of fructose is higher in the lumen, fructose is able to flow down a concentration gradient into the enterocytes, assisted by transport proteins. Fructose may be transported out of the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane by either GLUT2 or GLUT5, although the GLUT2 transporter has a greater capacity for transporting fructose, and, therefore, the majority of fructose is transported out of the enterocyte through GLUT2.

=== Capacity and rate of absorption ===
The absorption capacity for fructose in monosaccharide form ranges from less than 5 g to 50 g (per individual serving) and adapts with changes in dietary fructose intake. Studies show the greatest absorption rate occurs when glucose and fructose are administered in equal quantities. When fructose is ingested as part of the disaccharide sucrose, absorption capacity is much higher because fructose exists in a 1:1 ratio with glucose. It appears that the GLUT5 transfer rate may be saturated at low levels, and absorption is increased through joint absorption with glucose. One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is a glucose-dependent cotransport of fructose.
In addition, fructose transfer activity increases with dietary fructose intake. The presence of fructose in the lumen causes increased mRNA transcription of GLUT5, leading to increased transport proteins. High-fructose diets (&gt;2.4 g/kg body wt) increase the transport proteins within three days of intake.

=== Malabsorption ===
Several studies have measured the intestinal absorption of fructose using the hydrogen breath test. These studies indicate that fructose is not completely absorbed in the small intestine. When fructose is not absorbed in the small intestine, it is transported into the large intestine, where it is fermented by the colonic flora. Hydrogen is produced during the fermentation process and dissolves into the blood of the portal vein. This hydrogen is transported to the lungs, where it is exchanged across the lungs and is measurable by the hydrogen breath test. The colonic flora also produces carbon dioxide, short-chain fatty acids, organic acids, and trace gases in the presence of unabsorbed fructose. The presence of gases and organic acids in the large intestine causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and gastrointestinal pain. Exercise immediately after consumption can exacerbate these symptoms by decreasing transit time in the small intestine, resulting in a greater amount of fructose emptied into the large intestine.

== Fructose metabolism ==

All three dietary monosaccharides are transported into the liver by the GLUT2 transporter. Fructose and galactose are phosphorylated in the liver by fructokinase (Km= 0.5 mM) and galactokinase (Km = 0.8 mM), respectively. By contrast, glucose tends to pass through the liver (Km of hepatic glucokinase = 10 mM) and can be metabolised anywhere in the body. Uptake of fructose by the liver is not regulated by insulin. However, insulin is capable of increasing the abundance and functional activity of GLUT5, fructose transporter, in skeletal muscle cells.

=== Fructolysis ===
The initial catabolism of fructose is sometimes referred to as fructolysis, in analogy with glycolysis, the catabolism of glucose. In fructolysis, the enzyme fructokinase initially produces fructose 1-phosphate, which is split by aldolase B to produce the trioses dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde. Unlike glycolysis, in fructolysis the triose glyceraldehyde lacks a phosphate group. A third enzyme, triokinase, is therefore required to phosphorylate glyceraldehyde, producing glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The resulting trioses are identical to those obtained in glycolysis and can enter the gluconeogenic pathway for glucose or glycogen synthesis, or be further catabolized through the lower glycolytic pathway to pyruvate.

=== Metabolism of fructose to DHAP and glyceraldehyde ===
The first step in the metabolism of fructose is the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose 1-phosphate by fructokinase, thus trapping fructose for metabolism in the liver. Fructose 1-phosphate then undergoes hydrolysis by aldolase B to form DHAP and glyceraldehydes; DHAP can either be isomerized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by triosephosphate isomerase or undergo reduction to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The glyceraldehyde produced may also be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by glyceraldehyde kinase or further converted to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The metabolism of fructose at this point yields intermediates in the gluconeogenic pathway leading to glycogen synthesis as well as fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis.

=== Synthesis of glycogen from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ===
The resultant glyceraldehyde formed by aldolase B then undergoes phosphorylation to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Increased concentrations of DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the liver drive the gluconeogenic pathway toward glucose and subsequent glycogen synthesis. It appears that fructose is a better substrate for glycogen synthesis than glucose and that glycogen replenishment takes precedence over triglyceride formation. Once liver glycogen is replenished, the intermediates of fructose metabolism are primarily directed toward triglyceride synthesis.

=== Synthesis of triglyceride from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ===
Carbons from dietary fructose are found in both the free fatty acid and glycerol moieties of plasma triglycerides. High fructose consumption can lead to excess pyruvate production, causing a buildup of Krebs cycle intermediates. Accumulated citrate can be transported from the mitochondria into the cytosol of hepatocytes, converted to acetyl CoA by citrate lyase and directed toward fatty acid synthesis. In addition, DHAP can be converted to glycerol 3-phosphate, providing the glycerol backbone for the triglyceride molecule. Triglycerides are incorporated into very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are released from the liver destined toward peripheral tissues for storage in both fat and muscle cells.

== Potential health effects ==
In 2022, the European Food Safety Authority stated that there is research evidence that fructose and other added free sugars may be associated with increased risk of several chronic diseases: the risk is moderate for obesity and dyslipidemia (more than 50%), and low for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes (from 15% to 50%) and hypertension. EFSA further stated that clinical research did &quot;not support a positive relationship between the intake of dietary sugars, in isocaloric exchange with other macronutrients, and any of the chronic metabolic diseases or pregnancy-related endpoints assessed&quot; but advised &quot;the intake of added and free sugars should be as low as possible in the context of a nutritionally adequate diet.&quot;

=== Cardiometabolic diseases ===
When fructose is consumed in excess as a sweetening agent in foods or beverages, it may be associated with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders that are part of metabolic syndrome. 

=== Compared with sucrose ===
Fructose was found to increase triglycerides in type-2 but not type-1 diabetes and moderate use of it has previously been considered acceptable as a sweetener for diabetics, possibly because it does not trigger the production of insulin by pancreatic β cells. For a 50 gram reference amount, fructose has a glycemic index of 23, compared with 100 for glucose and 60 for sucrose. Fructose is also 73% sweeter than sucrose at room temperature, allowing diabetics to use less of it per serving. Fructose consumed before a meal may reduce the glycemic response of the meal. Fructose-sweetened food and beverage products cause less of a rise in blood glucose levels than do those manufactured with either sucrose or glucose.

<text>″s-Hertogenbosch (), colloquially known as Den Bosch (), is a city and municipality in the Netherlands with a population of 160,783. It is the capital of the province of North Brabant and its fourth largest city by population. The city is south of the Maas river and near the Waal.

== History ==
The city&#x27;s official name is a contraction of the (archaic) Dutch  — . The duke in question was Henry I, Duke of Brabant, whose family had owned a large estate at nearby Orthen for at least four centuries. He founded a new town located on some forested dunes in the middle of a marsh. At age 26, he granted &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch city rights and the corresponding trade privileges in 1185. This is the traditional date given by later chroniclers; the first mention in contemporaneous sources is 1196. The original charter has been lost. His reason for founding the city was to protect his own interests against encroachment from Gelre and Holland; from its first days, he conceived of the city as a fortress. It was destroyed in 1203 in a joint expedition of Gelre and Holland, but was soon rebuilt. Some remnants of the original city walls remain.
In the late 14th century, a much larger wall was erected to protect the greatly expanded settled area. Artificial waterways were dug to serve as a city moat, through which the rivers Dommel and Aa were diverted. &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch became the birthplace and home of one of the greatest painters of the northern Renaissance period, Hieronymus Bosch.

Until 1520, the city flourished, becoming the second largest population centre in the territory of the present Netherlands, after Utrecht. The city was also a center of music, and composers, such as Jheronimus Clibano, received their training at its churches. Others held positions there: Matthaeus Pipelare was musical director at the Confraternity of Our Lady; and renowned Habsburg copyist and composer Pierre Alamire did much of his work at &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

=== Eighty Years&#x27; War ===
The wars of the Reformation changed the course of the city&#x27;s history. It became an independent bishopric. During the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the city took the side of the Habsburg (Catholic) authorities and thwarted a Calvinist coup. It was besieged several times by Prince Maurice of Orange, stadtholder of most of the Dutch Republic, who wanted to bring &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch under the rule of the rebel United Provinces. The city was successfully defended against Prince Maurice in 1601 and again in 1603, but it eventually fell in the 1629 siege led by his brother Frederick Henry.

=== Thirty Years&#x27; War ===

In the years of Truce, before the renewed fighting after 1618, the fortifications were greatly expanded. The surrounding marshes made a siege of the conventional type impossible, and the fortress, deemed impregnable, was nicknamed &quot;moerasdraak&quot;, or the Swamp Dragon. The town was nevertheless finally conquered by Frederik Hendrik of Orange in 1629 in a typically Dutch stratagem: he diverted the rivers Dommel and Aa, created a polder by constructing a forty-kilometre (25 mile) dyke and then pumped out the water by mills. After a siege of three months, the city had to surrender—an enormous blow to Habsburg geo-political strategy during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. This surrender cut the town off from the rest of the duchy and the area was treated by the Republic as an occupation zone without political liberties (see also Generality Lands).

=== Louis XIV to Bonaparte ===
After the Peace of Westphalia, the fortifications were again expanded. In 1672, the Dutch &quot;rampjaar&quot;, the city held against the army of Louis XIV of France. In 1794 French revolutionary troops under the command of Charles Pichegru attacked the city. It was only weakly defended, and fell after a short siege. Pichegru then crossed the rivers and put an end to the Dutch Republic.

Under the new Batavian Republic, established in 1795, both Catholics and &quot;Brabanders&quot; at last gained equal rights. From 1806, the city became part of the Kingdom of Holland and from 1810, it was incorporated into the First French Empire. It was captured by the Prussians in 1814.

=== Kingdom of the Netherlands ===
The next year, 1815, when the United Kingdom of the Netherlands was established, it became the capital of North Brabant. Many newer and more modern fortresses were created in the vicinity of the city. A new canal was built, the &#x27;Zuid-Willemsvaart&#x27;, which gave the city an economic impulse. Trade, manufacturing and industry grew. Until 1878, it was forbidden to build outside the ramparts. That led to overcrowding and the highest infant mortality in the kingdom.

At the end of the 19th century, the very conservative city government prevented industrial investment to avoid an increase in the number of workers and the establishment of educational institutions: students were regarded as disorderly. As a result, the relative importance of the city diminished.

===World War II and after===

One of the few official Nazi concentration camp complexes in Western Europe outside Germany and Austria was named after &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. It operated from January 1943, to September 1944 and was known to the Germans as Herzogenbusch (see List of subcamps of Herzogenbusch). About 30,000 inmates were interned in the complex during this time, of whom about 12,000 were Jews. In the Netherlands, this camp is known as &#x27;Kamp Vught&#x27;, because the concentration camp was actually located at a heath near Vught, a village a few kilometres south of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

The city was occupied by German forces during World War II from 1940 to 1944. The railway station was bombed by planes of the Royal Air Force on 16 September 1944. The city was liberated between 24 and 27 October 1944 during Operation Pheasant by British soldiers of Major-General Robert Knox Ross&#x27;s 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division following the victory of the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment, of 158th Infantry Brigade over the enemy on 23–24 October.

After the war, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch was modernized, like many other cities in the Netherlands. It was possible that it was only the geography that shielded the old town from rigorous reconstruction in those early years. Just in time, the pendulum swung back to protecting the history of the city. In 1956, the council wanted to demolish the Moriaan, the oldest brick building in the Netherlands, to give traffic better access to the market square. The permit was refused by the government and instead the building was restored, starting in 1963. Later, city councils became much more aware of the value of historic buildings and from about the turn of the millennium, the historic fortifications are also given much attention by the authorities.

== Geography ==
=== Population centres ===
The population centres in the municipality are: Bokhoven, Crevecoeur, Deuteren (former village), Dieskant, Empel, Engelen, Gewande, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Hintham, Kruisstraat, Maliskamp, Meerwijk, Orthen (former village), Oud-Empel, and Rosmalen.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
==Economy==
The city of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch has become a center of industry, education, administration and culture. It is currently the fourth city of North Brabant. It is home to many national and international businesses such as Heineken, Epic, Tyco International, SAP and many others. The Jeroen Bosch Hospital is the biggest employer in the area, with over 4,000 employees.

==Culture==

&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch is home to a variety of events such as the theatre festival &quot;Boulevard&quot;, &quot;Jazz in Duketown&quot;, and hip hop in duketown, the start of the Tour de France (1996), Tour Feminin (1997), the International Vocal Competition, November Music (a contemporary music festival) and the UNICEF Open (formerly the Ordina Open) grass court tennis tournament (in the nearby town of Rosmalen). There are also over 350 restaurants, pubs and cafés to be found in the city.

&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch is also home to the European Ceramic Work Centre. This is a juried international ceramic residency where they invite artists, designers and architects from around to the world to explore the medium of Ceramics. This program was initially started in 1991 and continues to this day.

The city has its own food speciality, the Bossche Bol — effectively a giant profiterole, somewhat larger than a tennis ball, which is filled with whipped cream and coated with chocolate.

The spoken language is (the variant spoken in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch is called &quot;Bosch&quot; which is placed among the Central North Brabantian dialects, although other classification systems also describe it as East Brabantian), which is very similar to colloquial Dutch.

De Toonzaal is a music venue for chamber music, improvised music, and experimental music. For popular music there is the venue W2 (or Willem II).

=== Museums ===

The Noordbrabants Museum is a provincial museum with an overview of works that Vincent van Gogh made in Brabant. The Design Museum Den Bosch is a modern art museum. The Jheronimus Bosch Art Center, is dedicated to the work of Hieronymus Bosch. Other museums include the Swan Brothers&#x27; House and Museum Slager. Also the National (Dutch) Carnavalsmuseum Oeteldonks gemintemuzejum is located in the city. In the near future a new museum will be opened about the fortresses of the town and in general in Europe. The house where the famous painter Hieronymus produced his paintings can be visited on the market square.

===Carnival celebrations===

&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch has a strong carnival tradition. In its current form the story and symbolism dates from 1881 to 1883. In these years some citizens created the legend of &quot;Oeteldonk&quot;, whereby the city was renamed to Oeteldonk for the three day carnival. &quot;Donk&quot; is a reference to a dry place in the marsh. The frog is widely used as a symbol during the &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch Carnival. It is also a symbol of the Oeteldonk marsh. It was also a remark aimed at Bishop Godschalk from Den Dungen, where &#x27;Van den Oetelaar&#x27; was a common family name. He had wanted to forbid the traditional festivities of Shrove Tuesday that often led to excesses.

Oeteldonk is a village and therefore every inhabitant is a farmer or a &quot; (a girl or young woman), eliminating class differences. The village is headed by the Mayor &quot;Peer vaan den Muggenheuvel tot den Bobberd&quot;. Each year the mayor of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch hands over his authority to the Mayor of Oeteldonk. On Sunday at 11:11 AM the Mayor of Oeteldonk then receives Prince Carnaval &quot;Prince Amadeiro XXVI&quot; at Oeteldonk central station. From there a parade of all carnival clubs escorts the company to the town hall.

The citizens of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch wear traditional outfits throughout these days. A so-called &quot;boerenkiel&quot; is worn and every year patches are designed according to that years theme which can then be stitched onto the outfit. The &quot;boerenkiel&quot; is often combined with a traditional farmers bandana and a long scarf in the colors of Oeteldonk. The tradition of the Boerenkiel and / or Bandana is very different from the carnival traditions in the rest of the Netherlands. Other aspects like the parade, the temporary name and the temporary flag (for Oeteldonk red, white and yellow) are very similar.

==Attractions==

&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch was founded as a fortified city and that heritage can still be seen today. After World War II, plans were made to modernise the old city, by filling in the canals, removing or modifying some ramparts and redeveloping historic neighbourhoods. Before these plans could come to effect, the central government declared the city a protected townscape. Most historic elements have been preserved. In contrast to cities like Rotterdam, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch also survived the Second World War relatively unscathed. Much of its historic heritage remains intact, and today there are always renovations going on in the city to preserve the many old buildings, fortifications, churches and statues for later generations.

=== City center ===
The city center has a cosy atmosphere because of the almost continuous ramparts that still surround it. It has been molded by the multiple rivers that convene on &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, giving the center its strange street plan so different from the usual grid plan where streets meet at right angles. The center is dominated by Saint John&#x27;s Cathedral (&quot;Sint-Janskathedraal&quot; in Dutch), which dates from c. 1220 and is best known for its Brabantine Gothic design and the many sculptures of craftsmen that are sitting on almost every arc and rim along the outside of the cathedral. In 2010 an extensive restoration was completed, undoing the damage of many years of wear-and-tear and acid rain.

On the central square is the oldest remaining brick house of the Netherlands, &#x27;de Moriaan&#x27;, which was built at the beginning of the 13th century. In the 1960s, de Moriaan was renovated to its former glory based on a famous 16th-century Dutch painting called &#x27;De Lakenmarkt van &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch&#x27; (&#x27;The fabric market of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch&#x27;). The town hall is an original 14th-century Gothic building. After the town was conquered by the Dutch Republic in 1629, it received a new facade in the style of Dutch Baroque architecture. It showcased the authority of the new masters, just like the new town hall in Maastricht would.

Hidden below the old city is a canal network called the Binnendieze, which once spanned . It started out as a regular river, the Dommel, running through the city in medieval times. Due to a lack of space in the city, people started building their houses and roads over the river. Later, the Binnendieze functioned as a sewer and fell into disrepair. In recent decades, the remaining sixth part of the old waterway system has been renovated, and it is possible to take several guided subterranean boat trips through it.

=== Fortifications ===

&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch has an extensive and almost complete fifteenth-to-seventeenth-century city fortification. It was made to profit from the city&#x27;s strong defensive position, lying on a sandy hill in the center of a large swamp fed by many rivers. This also caused the main ramparts to be preserved, because they were crucial in keeping out the water. In 2004 the city was awarded the title &quot;European Fortress City of the year&quot;. In the years that followed it restored many of the city defenses to much of their old glory.

Apart from small sections of medieval walls, the main structure of the fortification is a late-medieval (fifteenth-century) wall. The upper sections were removed when cannon became more powerful, and polygonal bastions were added, some after the conquest by the republic. Most of these have not been restored to their original height, but do maintain their brick walls. The citadel in the north west of the city does retain its original height. Around the city itself many other fortresses can still be seen.

In the north east of the old city, the hexagonal gunpowder magazine, called is located close to the citadel. It is one of only a handful that still exist in the Netherlands, and was built when the city was still part of the Spanish Netherlands. It is planned to become the museum of fortress &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. One of the bastions of the fortress now houses the mini museum Bastionder. It has been dug out in a bastion of the south side. On the inside it shows a unique wrought iron cannon, and an older bastion that was walled in by the current one.

=== Nature ===

On the south side of the city, the city center and walls still border the Bossche Broek, an old polder that could never be made dry. In 1995 the dyke of the Dommel broke and an enormous amount of water entered the polder. It also flooded and blocked the main Dutch highway A2. In order to prevent this in the future, the area was rearranged to store excess water in case of emergencies. In 2006 the area had been furnished with higher dikes and locks that allowed a controlled flooding of the polder and some adjacent areas in case of emergency.

The Bossche Broek is now a nature reserve, that stretches all the way to Vught. It is connected to the Moerputten and Vlijmens Ven, with which it forms a Natura 2000 area. Rare species in the area are the scarce large blue and the European weather loach. The Moerputten sports the Moerputten Bridge, a 600 metre (650 yard) long nineteenth century railway bridge and engineering feat. What is unique about the area is its close proximity to the city center.

=== Miscellaneous ===
The city is also the location of the &quot;Bolwoningen&quot; complex, an array of fifty experimental spherical houses designed by Dries Kreijkamp.

The Lutheran Church, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch is no longer used as a church.

==Sport==
The city has one professional football club, FC Den Bosch. It is the 1967 successor of the professional branches of BVV (Bossche Voetbal Vereniging) and Wilhelmina. Both of them still exist as amateur football clubs. As a successor of BVV FC Den Bosch can claim the national championship of 1948. This championship led to the construction of stadium De Vliert, which at one time had a capacity of 30,000. Due to the less successful years that followed, the capacity is now only 8,500 visitors. FC Den Bosch was the first club of Dutch international player Ruud van Nistelrooy.

&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch is more successful in field hockey. It is home to top club HC Den Bosch. The women&#x27;s team in particular is a dominant force in the Dutch field hockey competition. The professional basketball club New Heroes Den Bosch is also very successful. The city&#x27;s rugby club is called The Dukes and dates from 1974. It is located at a very scenic location at the foot of the city walls. Because of the limited space, the club plays on artificial turf and part of the accommodation is subterranean. The Dukes has the most junior members. It became the national rugby champion in 2008.

As regards events the city is host to the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships, a combined ATP Tour and WTA Tour grass court tennis event played two weeks before the Wimbledon Championships. The World Archery Championships and World Para Archery Championship were held here in June 2019. During these combined World Championships two separate venues were used: the Parade and the rugby fields of The Dukes. All finals took place in the arena at the Parade. The Parade is a historic square surrounded by high trees, situated at the foot of the nearly seven-hundred-year-old Saint John&#x27;s Cathedral in the attractive center of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

==Transport==
The Zuid-Willemsvaart runs from the Meuse just north of the city towards Maastricht via Helmond and Weert. In &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch it runs through the city proper, south east from where a bastion has been cut off from the citadel. Because of this route it was impossible to widen it further than for ships of CEMT class II. Therefore, the Máxima Canal of 8 km (5 miles) was dug just east of the city, creating a shortcut from the canal to the Meuse suitable for ships of CEMT class IV. On the remaining part of the Zuid-Willemsvaart west of the city is the industrial harbor of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. A marina is located in the center.

&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch is situated on the busy A2 motorway, the most important north–south connection of the Netherlands. This connection was established with the opening of the Dieze Bridge in 1942. From 1961 the Utrecht-&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch section was 2 times 2 lanes. In 1970 the A2 was rerouted to the east of the city. In 1989 it finally became a controlled-access highway. In 1996 the section between &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Eindhoven became a controlled-access highway. The situation in Maastricht was only solved in 2016, when the Koning Willem-Alexandertunnel was opened. On the east–west axis &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch is on the A59 motorway. The A65 motorway between &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Tilburg is a regional highway, but is not completely access-controlled.

&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch railway station is on the Utrecht–Boxtel part of the railway stretch between Amsterdam and the Dutch industrial/tech center near Eindhoven. As a consequence north–south trains depart every ten minutes. On the Tilburg–Nijmegen railway trains run on a more modest schedule. &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch railway station is also a major station for Arriva buslines that serve the city and most of its suburbs. Other stations within the limits of the municipality are &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch Oost railway station and Rosmalen railway station. Vught railway station is actually closer to the city center than that in Rosmalen.

&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch has attempted to adapt to the growing popularity of the bicycle in Dutch cities. A reasonable amount of bike paths has so far been constructed in the town. In 2011, the city was chosen as &quot;Fietsstad 2011&quot;—the top bike city of the Netherlands for 2011. The details of the report were less jubilant and showed that it was really a prize meant to stimulate &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch to take further action; Hugo van der Steenhoven of the Fietsersbond: &quot;In the past years Den Bosch has spent much energy, ambition, creativity and money to give cycling an enormous boost. This is a big achievement for a city where bicycle use is lower than in the rest of the Netherlands&quot; (cyclist union).

==Education==
&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch has multiple vocational universities called &quot;Hogeschool&quot; in Dutch. The HAS Hogeschool of about 3,500 students is focused on agricultural and food technology. Avans Hogeschool is located in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and two nearby cities. The AKV St. Joost is an art academy that is now part of Avans and dates back to 1812. Fontys Hogeschool also offers some education in the city. The Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS), located at the Mariënburg Campus in the center of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, and provides a number of data science programs at graduate (MSc) and post-graduate level (PhD). It is a department of the Eindhoven University of Technology and Tilburg University.

In secondary education the City Gymnasium is a gymnasium (school) that originated from the Latin school of the city. It is comparable to a grammar school and can trace its origin back 1274. The same type of education and all other types of secondary education are offered by a number of large institutes.

==Religion==
Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, with somewhat more than 40% of the population counting themselves as belonging to it. Even so, attendance at mass is significantly lower than 40%. Three churches in the city center are still in use by the Catholic church: Saint John&#x27;s Cathedral, Saint Catherine and the Monastery Church of the Franciscans nearby the railway station. Smaller churches in use by the Roman Catholic church are: Saint Anne&#x27;s Church in Hintham, Saint Landoline Church in Empel, Saint Willibrord Church in Maaspoort, Saint Lambert Church (Rosmalen), etc.

The Protestant religion has seen its share of believers in the city fall from 20% to about 4%. It is based in the Great Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church is a new church in town. It is based at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Church where Catholic worship services have been held again since 2021.

The Arrahma Mosque has been built by the Moroccan community. The Turkish community has the Orhan Gazi Mosque.

<text>Major-General Thomas Harrison (baptised 16 July 1616 - executed 13 October 1660) was a prominent member of the radical religious sect known as the Fifth Monarchists, and a soldier who fought for Parliament and the Commonwealth in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. One of those who approved the Execution of Charles I in January 1649, he was a strong supporter of Oliver Cromwell before the two fell out when The Protectorate was established in 1653. Following the 1660 Stuart Restoration, he was arrested, found guilty of treason as a regicide, and sentenced to death. He was hanged, drawn and quartered on 13 October 1660, facing his execution with a courage noted by various observers, including the diarist Samuel Pepys.

==Personal details==
Thomas Harrison was baptised 16 July 1616, second of four children and only son of Richard Harrison, four times mayor of Newcastle-under-Lyme, and his wife Mary. In 1646, he married his cousin Catherine Harrison; they had three children, all of whom died as infants.

==Career== 
Harrison was probably educated at a local Grammar school before moving to London, where he became clerk to a lawyer based in Clifford&#x27;s Inn. When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, the Earl of Essex was appointed commander of the Parliamentarian army, and Harrison enlisted in his personal troop of Lifeguards, which was recruited almost exclusively from the Inns of Court. Other members included Charles Fleetwood, Edmund Ludlow and Nathaniel Rich, all of whom played important roles in the political and religious conflicts that followed. This unit fought in two of the earliest battles of the war, Powick Bridge in September and Edgehill in October 1642. 

In summer 1643, he transferred to the army of the Eastern Association as captain of a cavalry troop in the Earl of Manchester&#x27;s regiment. He had reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel by the time it took part in the decisive Battle of Marston Moor in July 1644. 

He fought in many of the major battles of the war and joined the New Model Army in 1645. By the end of the conflict he had risen to the rank of major-general and was a noted friend and supporter of Oliver Cromwell.

He was elected to the Long Parliament for Wendover in 1646. His regiment maintained strong Leveller sympathies, mutinying in 1647.

==Second English Civil War==
When conflict resumed he was wounded at Appleby in July 1648. He had to return to London but was well enough to command the escort that brought the King to London in January 1649. Harrison sat as a commissioner (judge) at the trial and was the seventeenth of fifty-nine commissioners to sign the death warrant of King Charles I.

In 1650, Harrison was appointed to a military command in Wales where he was apparently extremely severe. He was promoted to the rank of Major-General in 1651 and commanded the army in England during Cromwell&#x27;s Scottish expedition. He fought at the battle of Knutsford in August and at Worcester in September 1651.

By the early 1650s Harrison was associated with the radical Fifth Monarchists and became one of their key speakers. He still supported Cromwell and aided in the dissolution of the Rump Parliament in April 1653. He opposed the parliament on the basis that it was blocking more stringent religious reforms – he wanted a more &quot;godly&quot; parliament. Harrison was a radical member of the Nominated Assembly (Barebones Parliament) that replaced Parliament. When the assembly was dissolved, Harrison and others refused to leave and had to be forced out by soldiers. Harrison was dismissed from the Army in December.

Like many, he was outraged by the formation of the Protectorate and the elevation of Cromwell to Lord Protector. Under the Protectorate (1653–60) Harrison was imprisoned four times.

== Arrest and trial ==

After Cromwell&#x27;s death Harrison remained quietly in his home, supporting none of the contenders for power. Following the Stuart Restoration, Harrison declined to flee and was arrested in May 1660.

He was tried on 11 October 1660. Edmond Ludlow described the trial in his memoirs, 

Harrison&#x27;s sentence was &quot;That you be led to the place from whence you came, and from thence be drawn upon a hurdle to the place of execution, and then you shall be hanged by the neck and, being alive, shall be cut down, and your privy members to be cut off, and your entrails be taken out of your body and, you living, the same to be burnt before your eyes, and your head to be cut off, your body to be divided into four-quarters, and head and quarters to be disposed of at the pleasure of the King&#x27;s majesty. And the Lord have mercy on your soul.&quot;

==Execution==
Major-General Harrison was the first of the regicides to be executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered on 13 October 1660. Harrison, after being hanged for several minutes and then cut open, was reported to have leaned across and hit his executioner—resulting in the swift removal of his head. His entrails were thrown onto a nearby fire. His head adorned the sledge that drew fellow regicide John Cook to his execution, before being displayed in Westminster Hall; his quarters were fastened to the city gates.

Samuel Pepys wrote an eyewitness account of the execution at Charing Cross, in which Major General Harrison was drily reported to be &quot;looking as cheerful as any man could do in that condition&quot;. This account is also quoted on a plaque on the wall of the Hung, Drawn and Quartered public house near Pepys Street, where the diarist lived and worked in the Navy Office. In his final moments, as he was being led up the scaffold, the hangman asked for his forgiveness. Upon hearing his request, Thomas Harrison replied, &quot;I do forgive thee with all my heart... Alas poor man, thou doith it ignorantly, the Lord grant that this sin may be not laid to thy charge.&quot; Thomas Harrison then gave all of the money that remained in his pockets to his executioner and was thereafter executed.

Edmond Ludlow also provided an account of the execution at Charing Cross: 
In his book &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot;, Steven Pinker wrote about the execution:

<text>A frontier is a political and geographical term referring to areas near or beyond a boundary.

== Australia ==

The term &quot;frontier&quot; was frequently used in colonial Australia in the meaning of country that borders the unknown or uncivilised, the boundary, border country, the borders of civilisation, or as the land that forms the furthest extent of what was frequently termed &quot;the inside&quot; or &quot;settled&quot; districts. The &quot;outside&quot; was another term frequently used in colonial Australia, this term seemingly covered not only the frontier but the districts beyond. Settlers at the frontier thus frequently referred to themselves as &quot;the outsiders&quot; or &quot;outside residents&quot; and to the area in which they lived as &quot;the outside districts&quot;. At times one might hear the &quot;frontier&quot; described as &quot;the outside borders&quot;. However the term &quot;frontier districts&quot; was seemingly used predominantly in the early Australian colonial newspapers whenever dealing with skirmishes between black and white in northern New South Wales and Queensland, and in newspaper reports from South Africa, whereas it was seemingly not so commonly used when dealing with affairs in Victoria, South Australia and southern New South Wales. The use of the word &quot;frontier&quot; was thus frequently connected to descriptions of frontier violence, as in a letter printed in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in December 1850 which described murder and carnage at the northern frontier and calling for the protection of the settlers saying: &quot;...nothing but a strong body of Native Police will restore and keep order in the frontier districts, and as the squatters are taxed for the purpose of such protection&quot;.

== South America ==

=== Argentina ===
The southern indigenous frontier of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was the southern limit into which the viceyolty could exert its rule. Beyond this lay territories &quot;de facto&quot; controlled by indigenous peoples who inhabited the Pampas and Patagonia. These group were mainly the Tehuelche, Pehuenche, Mapuche, and the Ranqueles. 

Various military campaigns and peace treaties were arranged by the Spanish in order to either stop indigenous incursions in Spanish lands or to advance the frontier into indigenous territory.

Under General Julio Argentino Roca, the Conquest of the Desert extended Argentine power into Patagonia.

===Bolivia===

For long time a frontier existed east of Tarija in southeastern Bolivia. Starting in the late 16th century the Spanish saw the tribes inhabiting the eastern jungles, and the &quot;Chiriguanos&quot; in particular, as a threat. This frontier attracted Maroons and indigenous individuals who escaped Spanish rule in the Real Audiencia of Charcas. The frontier remained remakably stable until the late 18th century when the Spanish made some advances into the Chiriguano territory. Later, in the second half of the 19th century a more definitive advance begun on the Chiriguano lands with the last resistance being crushed in the early 20th century.

===Chile===

The Destruction of the Seven Cities (1599–1604) led to the formation of a frontier called La Frontera, with the Spanish ruling north of Biobío River and Mapuche retaining independence south of the said river. Within this frontier the city of Concepción assumed the role of &quot;military capital&quot; of Spanish-ruled Chile. This informal role was given by the establishment of the Spanish Army of Arauco in the city which was financed by a payments of silver from Potosí called Real Situado. Santiago located at some distance from the war zone remained the political capital since 1578.

Following the Mapuche uprising of 1655 and abolition of Mapuche slavery in 1683 in the Spanish Empire trade across the frontier increased. Mapuche-Spanish and later Mapuche-Chilean trade increased further in the second half of the 18th century as hostilities decreased. Mapuches obtained goods from Chile and some dressed in &quot;Spanish&quot; clothing. Despite close contacts Chileans and Mapuches remained socially, politically and economically distinct. Spanish and later Chilean officials with the titles of comisario de naciones and capitán de amigos acted as intermediaries between the Mapuche and colonial and republican authorities.

During the Occupation of Araucanía the Republic of Chile advanced the frontier south from Bío Bío River to Malleco River where a well defended line of forts was established between 1861 and 1871.

Having decisively defeated Peru in the battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores in January 1881 Chilean authorities turned their attention to the southern frontier in Araucanía seeking to defend the previous advances that had been so difficult to establish. The idea was not only to defend forts and settlements but also to advance the frontier all the way from Malleco River to Cautín River.
==United States==
In the United States, the frontier was the term applied by scholars to the impact of the zone of land beyond the region of existing European occupation. That is, as pioneers moved into the frontier zone they were changed significantly by the encounter. That is what Frederick Jackson Turner called &quot;the significance of the frontier.&quot; For example, Turner argued in 1893, one change was that unlimited free land in the zone was available and thus offered the psychological sense of unlimited opportunity, which in turn had many consequences, such as optimism, future orientation, shedding of restraints caused by land scarcity, and wastefulness of natural resources.

Operating in tandem with the doctrine of &quot;manifest destiny&quot;, the &quot;frontier&quot; concept also had a massive impact on Native Americans like the declaration of &quot;terra nullius&quot; enacted by the British around 1835 to legitimize their colonization of Australia. The idea implicitly negated any recognition of legitimate pre-existing occupation and embodied a blank denial of land rights to the indigenous peoples whose territories were being annexed by European colonists.

Throughout American history, the expansion of settlement was largely from the east to the west and so the frontier is often identified with &quot;the West.&quot; On the Pacific Coast, settlement moved eastward. In New England, it moved north.

&quot;Frontier&quot; was borrowed into English from French in the 15th century with the meaning &quot;borderland,&quot; the region of a country that fronts on another country (see also marches). The use of frontier to mean &quot;a region at the edge of a settled area&quot; is a special North American development. (Compare the Australian &quot;outback&quot;.) In the Turnerian sense, &quot;frontier&quot; was a technical term that was explicated by hundreds of scholars.

===Colonial North America===

In the earliest days of European settlement of the Atlantic Coast, the frontier was essentially any part of the forested interior of the continent beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the coast and the great rivers such as the St. Lawrence, Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, Susquehanna River and James.

British, French, Spanish, and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different from one another. Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada; the habitants settled in villages along the St. Lawrence River, built communities that remained stable for long stretches, and did not leapfrog west the way that the Americans would. Although French fur traders ranged widely through the Great Lakes and Mississippi River watershed, as far as the Rocky Mountains, they did not usually settle down. Actual French settlement in those areas was limited to a few very small villages on the lower Mississippi and in the Illinois Country.

Likewise, the Dutch set up fur trading posts in the Hudson River Valley, followed by large grants of land to patroons, who brought in tenant farmers who created compact permanent villages but did not push westward.

In contrast, the British colonies generally pursued a more systematic policy of widespread settlement of the New World for cultivation and exploitation of the land, a practice that required the extension of European property rights to the new continent. The typical British settlements were quite compact and small: under a square mile. Conflict with the Native Americans arose out of political issues on who would rule. Early frontier areas east of the Appalachian Mountains included the Connecticut River Valley. The French and Indian Wars of the 1760s resulted in a complete victory for the British, who took over the French colonial territory west of the Appalachians to the Mississippi River. The Americans began moving across the Appalachians into areas such the Ohio Country and the New River Valley.

===American frontier===

After victory the American Revolutionary War and the signing Treaty of Paris in 1783, the United States gained formal, if not actual, control of the British lands west of the Appalachians. Many thousands of settlers, typified by Daniel Boone, had already reached Kentucky and Tennessee and adjacent areas. Some areas, such as the Virginia Military District and the Connecticut Western Reserve (both in Ohio), were used by the states as rewards to veterans of the war. How to formally include the new frontier areas into the nation was an important issue in the Continental Congress in the 1780s and was partly resolved by the Northwest Ordinance (1787). The Southwest Territory saw a similar pattern of settlement pressure.

For the next century, the expansion of the nation into those areas, as well as the subsequently-acquired Louisiana Purchase, Oregon Country, and Mexican Cession, attracted hundreds of thousands of settlers. The question of whether the Kansas Territory would become &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;free&quot; helped to spark the American Civil War. In general before 1860, Northern Democrats promoted easy land ownership, and Whigs and Southern Democrats resisted the Homestead Acts for supporting the growth of a free farmer population that might oppose slavery and for depoulating the East.

When the Republican Party came to power in 1860, it promoted a policy of a free land, notably the Homestead Act of 1862, coupled with railroad land grants that opened cheap (but not free) lands for settlers. In 1890, the frontier line had broken up; census maps defined the frontier line as a line beyond which the population was under 2 persons per square mile.

The impact of the frontier in popular culture was enormous, as shown in dime novels, Wild West shows, and after 1910 Western films that were set on the frontier.

The American frontier was generally the edge of settlement in the West and typically was more democratic and free-spirited in nature than the East because of the lack of social and political institutions. The idea that the frontier provided the core defining quality of the United States was elaborated by the great historian Frederick Jackson Turner, who built his Frontier Thesis in 1893 around the notion.

==Canadian frontier==
A Canadian frontier thesis was developed by the Canadian historians Harold Adams Innis and J. M. S. Careless, who emphasized the relationship between the center and periphery. Katerberg argues that &quot;in Canada the imagined West must be understood in relation to the mythic power of the North&quot; (Katerberg 2003). Innis&#x27;s 1930 work &quot;The Fur Trade in Canada&quot; expounded on what became known as the Laurentian thesis: the most creative and major developments in Canadian history occurred in the metropolitan centres of Central Canada, and the civilization of North America is the civilization of Europe. Innis considered place to be critical in the development of the Canadian West and wrote of the importance of metropolitan areas, settlements, and indigenous people in the creation of markets. Turner and Innis have continued to exert influence over the historiography of the American and Canadian Wests. The Quebec frontier showed little of the individualism or democracy that Turner ascribed to the American zone to the south. The Nova Scotia and Ontario frontiers were more democratic than the rest of Canada, but whether that was caused by the need to be self-reliant on the frontier itself or the presence of large numbers of American immigrants is debated.

The Canadian political thinker Charles Blattberg has argued that such events ought to be seen as part of a process in which Canadians advanced a &quot;border,&quot; as distinct from a &quot;frontier,&quot; from east to west. According to Blattberg, a border assumes a significantly sharper contrast between the civilized and the uncivilized since unlike a frontier process in which the civilizing force is not supposed to be shaped by what it civilizes. Blattberg criticizes both the frontier and the border &quot;civilizing&quot; processes.

===Canadian Prairies===
The pattern of settlement of the Canadian Prairies began in 1896, when the American Prairies had already achieved statehood. Pioneers then headed north to the &quot;Last Best West.&quot; 
Before the settlers began to arrive, the North West Mounted Police had been dispatched to the region. When the settlers began to arrive, a system of law and order was already in place, and the Dakotas&#x27; lawlessness that was famous for the American &quot;Wild West&quot; did not occur in Canada. The federal government had also sent teams of negotiators to meet with the indigenous peoples of the region. In a series of treaties, the basis for peaceful relations was established, and the long wars with the Natives that occurred in the United States largely did not spread to Canada.

Like their American counterparts, the Canadian Prairies supported populist and democratic movements in the early 20th century.

ISSN 1084-5453. Proposes a five-part conceptual framework for the study of environmental history in the Canadian North. The first element of the framework analyzes approaches to environmental history that are applicable to the Canadian North. The second element reviews historical forces, myths, and defining characteristics that pertain to the region. A third element of the framework tests the validity of Turner&#x27;s Frontier Thesis and Creighton&#x27;s Metropolitan Thesis when applied to northern Canada. The fourth element consists of an overview of major northern environmental trends. The final element consists of four interrelated themes that identify the environmental relationships between northern and southern Canada.

<text>Urban design is an approach to the design of buildings and the spaces between them that focuses on specific design processes and outcomes based on geographical location. In addition to designing and shaping the physical features of towns, cities, and regional spaces, urban design considers &#x27;bigger picture&#x27; issues of economic, social and environmental value and social design. The scope of a project can range from a local street or public space to an entire city and surrounding areas. Urban designers connect the fields of architecture, landscape architecture and urban planning to better organize local and community environments&#x27; dependent upon geographical location.

Some important focuses of urban design on this page include its historical impact, paradigm shifts, its interdisciplinary nature, and issues related to urban design.

==Theory==

Urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings, infrastructure, streets, and public spaces, entire neighbourhoods and districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making urban environments that are equitable, beautiful, performative, and sustainable.

Urban design is an interdisciplinary field that utilizes the procedures and the elements of architecture and other related professions, including landscape design, urban planning, civil engineering, and municipal engineering, while extenuating to the Spatial Sciences. It borrows substantive and procedural knowledge from public administration, sociology, law, urban geography, urban economics and other related disciplines from the social and behavioral sciences, as well as from the natural sciences. In more recent times different sub-subfields of urban design have emerged such as strategic urban design, landscape urbanism, water-sensitive urban design, and sustainable urbanism. Urban design demands an understanding of a wide range of subjects from physical geography to social science, and an appreciation for disciplines, such as real estate development, urban economics, political economy, and social theory.

Urban design theory deals primarily with the design and management of public space (i.e. the &#x27;public environment&#x27;, &#x27;public realm&#x27; or &#x27;public domain&#x27;), and the way public places are used and experienced. Public space includes the totality of spaces used freely on a day-to-day basis by the general public, such as streets, plazas, parks, and public infrastructure. Some aspects of privately owned spaces, such as building facades or domestic gardens, also contribute to public space and are therefore also considered by urban design theory. Important writers on urban design theory include Christopher Alexander, Peter Calthorpe, Gordon Cullen, Andrés Duany, Jane Jacobs, Jan Gehl, Allan B. Jacobs, Kevin Lynch, Aldo Rossi, Colin Rowe, Robert Venturi, William H. Whyte, Camillo Sitte, Bill Hillier (space syntax), and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk.

==History==

Although contemporary professional use of the term &#x27;urban design&#x27; dates from the mid-20th century, urban design as such has been practiced throughout history. Ancient examples of carefully planned and designed cities exist in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, and are particularly well known within Classical Chinese, Roman, and Greek cultures. Specifically, Hippodamus of Miletus was a famous ancient Greek architect and urban planner, and all around academic that is often considered to be a &quot;father of European urban planning&quot;, and the namesake of the &quot;Hippodamian plan&quot;, also known as the grid plan of a city layout.

European Medieval cities are often, and often erroneously, regarded as exemplars of undesigned or &#x27;organic&#x27; city development. There are many examples of considered urban design in the Middle Ages. In England, many of the towns listed in the 9th-century Burghal Hidage were designed on a grid, examples including Southampton, Wareham, Dorset and Wallingford, Oxfordshire, having been rapidly created to provide a defensive network against Danish invaders. 12th century western Europe brought renewed focus on urbanisation as a means of stimulating economic growth and generating revenue. The burgage system dating from that time and its associated burgage plots brought a form of self-organising design to medieval towns. 

Throughout history, the design of streets and deliberate configuration of public spaces with buildings have reflected contemporaneous social norms or philosophical and religious beliefs. Yet the link between designed urban space and the human mind appears to be . Indeed, the reverse impact of urban structure upon human behaviour and upon thought is evidenced by both observational study and historical records. There are clear indications of impact through Renaissance urban design on the thought of Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei. Already René Descartes in his &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot; had attested to the impact Renaissance planned new towns had upon his own thought, and much evidence exists that the Renaissance streetscape was also the perceptual stimulus that had led to the development of coordinate geometry.

===Early modern era===
The beginnings of modern urban design in Europe are associated with the Renaissance but, especially, with the Age of Enlightenment. Spanish colonial cities were often planned, as were some towns settled by other imperial cultures. These sometimes embodied utopian ambitions as well as aims for functionality and good governance, as with James Oglethorpe&#x27;s plan for Savannah, Georgia. In the Baroque period the design approaches developed in French formal gardens such as Versailles were extended into urban development and redevelopment. In this period, when modern professional specializations did not exist, urban design was undertaken by people with skills in areas as diverse as sculpture, architecture, garden design, surveying, astronomy, and military engineering. In the 18th and 19th centuries, urban design was perhaps most closely linked with surveyors engineers and architects. The increase in urban populations brought with it problems of epidemic disease, the response to which was a focus on public health, the rise in the UK of municipal engineering and the inclusion in British legislation of provisions such as minimum widths of street in relation to heights of buildings in order to ensure adequate light and ventilation.

Much of Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s work was concerned with urban design, and the newly formed profession of landscape architecture also began to play a significant role in the late 19th century.

===Modern urban design===

In the 19th century, cities were industrializing and expanding at a tremendous rate. Private businesses largely dictated the pace and style of this development. The expansion created many hardships for the working poor and concern for public health increased. However, the laissez-faire style of government, in fashion for most of the Victorian era, was starting to give way to a New Liberalism. This gave more power to the public. The public wanted the government to provide citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments. Around 1900, modern urban design emerged from developing theories on how to mitigate the consequences of the industrial age.

The first modern urban planning theorist was Sir Ebenezer Howard. His ideas, although utopian, were adopted around the world because they were highly practical. He initiated the garden city movement. in 1898.
His garden cities were intended to be planned, self-contained communities surrounded by parks. Howard wanted the cities to be proportional with separate areas of residences, industry, and agriculture. Inspired by the Utopian novel &quot;Looking Backward&quot; and Henry George&#x27;s work &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, Howard published his book &quot;Garden Cities of To-morrow&quot; in 1898. His work is an important reference in the history of urban planning. He envisioned the self-sufficient garden city to house 32,000 people on a site of . He planned on a concentric pattern with open spaces, public parks, and six radial boulevards, wide, extending from the center. When it reached full population, Howard wanted another garden city to be developed nearby. He envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as satellites of a central city of 50,000 people, linked by road and rail. His model for a garden city was first created at Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. Howard&#x27;s movement was extended by Sir Frederic Osborn to regional planning.

====20th century====
In the early 1900s, urban planning became professionalized. With input from utopian visionaries, civil engineers, and local councilors, new approaches to city design were developed for consideration by decision-makers such as elected officials. In 1899, the Town and Country Planning Association was founded. In 1909, the first academic course on urban planning was offered by the University of Liverpool. Urban planning was first officially embodied in the Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909 Howard&#x27;s &#x27;garden city&#x27; compelled local authorities to introduce a system where all housing construction conformed to specific building standards. In the United Kingdom following this Act, surveyor, civil engineers, architects, and lawyers began working together within local authorities. In 1910, Thomas Adams became the first Town Planning Inspector at the Local Government Board and began meeting with practitioners. In 1914, The Town Planning Institute was established. The first urban planning course in America was not established until 1924 at Harvard University. Professionals developed schemes for the development of land, transforming town planning into a new area of expertise.

In the 20th century, urban planning was changed by the automobile industry. Car-oriented design impacted the rise of &#x27;urban design&#x27;. City layouts now revolved around roadways and traffic patterns.

In June 1928, the International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM) was founded at the Chateau de la Sarraz in Switzerland, by a group of 28 European architects organized by Le Corbusier, Hélène de Mandrot, and Sigfried Giedion. The CIAM was one of many 20th century manifestos meant to advance the cause of &quot;architecture as a social art&quot;.
=====Postwar=====
Team X was a group of architects and other invited participants who assembled starting in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of the International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM) and created a schism within CIAM by challenging its doctrinaire approach to urbanism.

In 1956, the term &quot;Urban design&quot; was first used at a series of conferences hosted by Harvard University. The event provided a platform for Harvard&#x27;s Urban Design program. The program also utilized the writings of famous urban planning thinkers: Gordon Cullen, Jane Jacobs, Kevin Lynch, and Christopher Alexander.

In 1961, Gordon Cullen published &quot;The Concise Townscape&quot;. He examined the traditional artistic approach to city design of theorists including Camillo Sitte, Barry Parker, and Raymond Unwin. Cullen also created the concept of &#x27;serial vision&#x27;. It defined the urban landscape as a series of related spaces.

Also in 1961, Jane Jacobs published &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;. She critiqued the modernism of CIAM (International Congresses of Modern Architecture). Jacobs also claimed crime rates in publicly owned spaces were rising because of the Modernist approach of &#x27;city in the park&#x27;. She argued instead for an &#x27;eyes on the street&#x27; approach to town planning through the resurrection of main public space precedents (e.g. streets, squares).

In the same year, Kevin Lynch published &quot;The Image of the City&quot;. He was seminal to urban design, particularly with regards to the concept of legibility. He reduced urban design theory to five basic elements: paths, districts, edges, nodes, landmarks. He also made the use of mental maps to understand the city popular, rather than the two-dimensional physical master plans of the previous 50 years.

Other notable works:

* &quot;Architecture of the City&quot; by Aldo Rossi (1966)
* &quot;Learning from Las Vegas&quot; by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown (1972)
* &quot;Collage City&quot; by Colin Rowe (1978)
* &quot;The Next American Metropolis&quot; by Peter Calthorpe (1993)
* &quot;The Social Logic of Space&quot; by Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson (1984)

The popularity of these works resulted in terms that become everyday language in the field of urban planning. Aldo Rossi introduced &#x27;historicism&#x27; and &#x27;collective memory&#x27; to urban design. Rossi also proposed a &#x27;collage metaphor&#x27; to understand the collection of new and old forms within the same urban space. Peter Calthorpe developed a manifesto for sustainable urban living via medium-density living. He also designed a manual for building new settlements in his concept of Transit Oriented Development (TOD). Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson introduced Space Syntax to predict how movement patterns in cities would contribute to urban vitality, anti-social behaviour, and economic success. &#x27;Sustainability&#x27;, &#x27;livability&#x27;, and &#x27;high quality of urban components&#x27; also became commonplace in the field.

====Current trends====
Today, urban design seeks to create sustainable urban environments with long-lasting structures, buildings, and overall livability. Walkable urbanism is another approach to practice that is defined within the &quot;Charter of New Urbanism&quot;. It aims to reduce environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create smart cities that support sustainable transport. Compact urban neighborhoods encourage residents to drive less. These neighborhoods have significantly lower environmental impacts when compared to sprawling suburbs. To prevent urban sprawl, Circular flow land use management was introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns.

As a result of the recent New Classical Architecture movement, sustainable construction aims to develop smart growth, walkability, architectural tradition, and classical design. It contrasts with modernist and globally uniform architecture. In the 1980s, urban design began to oppose the increasing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl.
Managed Urbanisation with the view to making the urbanising process completely culturally and economically, and environmentally sustainable, and as a possible solution to the urban sprawl, Frank Reale has submitted an interesting concept of Expanding Nodular Development (E.N.D.) that integrates many urban designs and ecological principles, to design and build smaller rural hubs with high-grade connecting freeways, rather than adding more expensive infrastructure to existing big cities and the resulting congestion.

==== Paradigm shifts ====
Throughout the young existence of the Urban Design discipline, many paradigm shifts have occurred that have affected the trajectory of the field regarding theory and practice. These paradigm shifts cover multiple subject areas outside of the traditional design disciplines.

* Team 10 - The first major paradigm shift was the formation of Team 10 out of CIAM, or the Congres Internationaux d&#x27;Architecture Moderne. They believed that Urban Design should introduce ideas of &#x27;Human Association&#x27;, which pivots the design focus from the individual patron to concentrating on the collective urban population.
* The Brundtland Report and Silent Spring - Another paradigm shift was the publication of the Brundtland Report and the book Silent Spring by Rachel Carson. These writings introduced the idea that human settlements could have detrimental impacts on ecological processes, as well as human health, which spurred a new era of environmental awareness in the field. 
* The Planner&#x27;s Triangle - The Planner&#x27;s Triangle, created by Scott Cambell, emphasized three main conflicts in the planning process. This diagram exposed the complex relationships between Economic Development, Environmental Protection, and Equity and Social Justice. For the first time, the concept of Equity and Social Justice was considered as equally important as Economic Development and Environmental Protection within the design process.
* Death of Modernism (Demolition of Pruitt Igoe) - Pruitt Igoe was a spatial symbol and representation of Modernist theory regarding social housing. In its failure and demolition, these theories were put into question and many within the design field considered the era of Modernism to be dead. 
* Neoliberalism &amp; the election of Reagan - The election of President Reagan and the rise of Neoliberalism affected the Urban Design discipline because it shifted the planning process to emphasize capitalistic gains and spatial privatization. Inspired by the trickle-down approach of Reaganomics, it was believed that the benefits of a capitalist emphasis within design would positively impact everyone. Conversely, this led to exclusionary design practices and to what many consider as &quot;the death of public space&quot;.
* Right to the City - The spatial and political battle over our citizens&#x27; rights to the city has been an ongoing one. David Harvey, along with Dan Mitchell and Edward Soja, discussed rights to the city as a matter of shifting the historical thinking of how spatial matter was determined in a critical form. This change of thinking occurred in three forms: ontologically, sociologically, and the combination of this socio-spatial dialect. Together the aim shifted to be able to measure what matters in a socio-spatial context. 
* Black Lives Matter (Ferguson) - The Black Lives Matter movement challenged design thinking because it emphasized the injustices and inequities suffered by people of color in urban space, as well as emphasized their right to public space without discrimination and brutality. It claims that minority groups lack certain spatial privileges and that this deficiency can result in matters of life and death. In order to reach an equitable state of urbanism, there needs to be equal identification of socio-economic lives within our urbanscapes.

== New approaches ==
There have been many different theories and approaches applied to the practice of urban design.

New Urbanism is an approach that began in the 1980s as a place-making initiative to combat suburban sprawl. Its goal is to increase density by creating compact and complete towns and neighborhoods. The 10 principles of new urbanism are walkability, connectivity, mixed-use and diversity, mixed housing, quality architecture and urban design, traditional neighborhood structure, increased density, smart transportation, sustainability, and quality of life. New urbanism and the developments that it has created are sources of debates within the discipline, primarily with the landscape urbanist approach but also due to its reproduction of idyllic architectural tropes that do not respond to the context. Andres Duany, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, Peter Calthorpe, and Jeff Speck are all strongly associated with New Urbanism and its evolution over the years.

Landscape Urbanism is a theory that first surfaced in the 1990s, arguing that the city is constructed of interconnected and ecologically rich horizontal field conditions, rather than the arrangement of objects and buildings. Charles Waldheim, Mohsen Mostafavi, James Corner, and Richard Weller are closely associated with this theory. Landscape urbanism theorises sites, territories, ecosystems, networks, and infrastructures through landscape practice according to Corner, while applying a dynamic concept to cities as ecosystems that grow, shrink or change phases of development according to Waldheim.

Everyday Urbanism is a concept introduced by Margaret Crawford and influenced by Henry Lefebvre that describes the everyday lived experience shared by urban residents including commuting, working, relaxing, moving through city streets and sidewalks, shopping, buying, eating food, and running errands. Everyday urbanism is not concerned with aesthetic value. Instead, it introduces the idea of eliminating the distance between experts and ordinary users and forces designers and planners to contemplate a &#x27;shift of power&#x27; and address social life from a direct and ordinary perspective.

Tactical Urbanism (also known as DIY Urbanism, Planning-by-Doing, Urban Acupuncture, or Urban Prototyping) is a city, organizational, or citizen-led approach to neighborhood-building that uses short-term, low-cost, and scalable interventions and policies to catalyze long term change.

Top-up Urbanism is the theory and implementation of two techniques in urban design: top-down and bottom-up. Top-down urbanism is when the design is implemented from the top of the hierarchy - normally the government or planning department. Bottom-up or grassroots urbanism begins with the people or the bottom of the hierarchy. Top-up means that both methods are used together to make a more participatory design, so it is sure to be comprehensive and well regarded in order to be as successful as possible.

Infrastructural Urbanism is the study of how the major investments that go into making infrastructural systems can be leveraged to be more sustainable for communities. Instead of the systems being solely about efficiency in both cost and production, infrastructural urbanism strives to utilize these investments to be more equitable for social and environmental issues as well. Linda Samuels is a designer investigating how to accomplish this change in infrastructure in what she calls &quot;next-generation infrastructure&quot; which is &quot;multifunctional; public; visible; socially productive; locally specific, flexible, and adaptable; sensitive to the eco-economy; composed of design prototypes or demonstration projects; symbiotic; technologically smart; and developed collaboratively across disciplines and agencies&quot;.

Sustainable Urbanism is the study from the 1990s of how a community can be beneficial for the ecosystem, the people, and the economy for which it is associated. It is based on Scott Campbell&#x27;s planner&#x27;s triangle which tries to find the balance between economy, equity, and the environment. Its main concept is to try and make cities as self-sufficient as possible while not damaging the ecosystem around them, today with an increased focus on climate stability. A key designer working with sustainable urbanism is Douglas Farr.

Feminist Urbanism is the study and critique of how the built environment affects genders differently because of patriarchal social and political structures in society. Typically, the people at the table making design decisions are men, so their conception about public space and the built environment relates to their life perspectives and experiences, which do not reflect the same experiences of women or children. Dolores Hayden is a scholar who has researched this topic from 1980 to the present day. Hayden&#x27;s writing says, “when women, men, and children of all classes and races can identify the public domain as the place where they feel most comfortable as citizens, Americans will finally have homelike urban space.”

Educational Urbanism is an emerging discipline, at the crossroads of urban planning, educational planning, and pedagogy. An approach that tackles the notion that economic activities, the need for new skills at the workplace, and the spatial configuration of the workplace rely on the spatial reorientation in the design of educational spaces and the urban dimension of educational planning.

Black Urbanism is an approach in which black communities are active creators, innovators, and authors of the process of designing and creating the neighborhoods and spaces of the metropolitan areas they have done so much to help revive over the past half-century. The goal is not to build black cities for black people but to explore and develop the creative energy that exists in so-called black areas: that has the potential to contribute to the sustainable development of the whole city.

=== Debates in urbanism ===
Underlying the practice of urban design are the many theories about how to best design the city. Each theory makes a unique claim about how to effectively design thriving, sustainable urban environments. Debates over the efficacy of these approaches fill the urban design discourse. Landscape Urbanism and New Urbanism are commonly debated as distinct approaches to addressing suburban sprawl. While Landscape Urbanism proposes landscape as the basic building block of the city and embraces horizontality, flexibility, and adaptability, New Urbanism offers the neighborhood as the basic building block of the city and argues for increased density, mixed uses, and walkability. Opponents of Landscape Urbanism point out that most of its projects are urban parks, and as such, its application is limited. Opponents of New Urbanism claim that its preoccupation with traditional neighborhood structures is nostalgic, unimaginative, and culturally problematic. Everyday Urbanism argues for grassroots neighborhood improvements rather than master-planned, top-down interventions. Each theory elevates the roles of certain professions in the urban design process, further fueling the debate. In practice, urban designers often apply principles from many urban design theories. Emerging from the conversation is a universal acknowledgement of the importance of increased interdisciplinary collaboration in designing the modern city.

==Urban design as an integrative profession==

Urban designers work with architects, landscape architects, transportation engineers, urban planners, and industrial designers to reshape the city. Cooperation with public agencies, authorities and the interests of nearby property owners is necessary to manage public spaces. Users often compete over the spaces and negotiate across a variety of spheres. Input is frequently needed from a wide range of stakeholders. This can lead to different levels of participation as defined in Arnstein&#x27;s Ladder of Citizen Participation.

While there are some professionals who identify themselves specifically as urban designers, a majority have backgrounds in urban planning, architecture, or landscape architecture. Many collegiate programs incorporate urban design theory and design subjects into their curricula. There is an increasing number of university programs offering degrees in urban design at the post-graduate level.

Urban design considers:

*Pedestrian zones
*Incorporation of nature within a city
*Aesthetics
*&quot;Urban structure&quot; – arrangement and relation of business and people
*&quot;Urban typology, density,&quot; and sustainability - spatial types and morphologies related to the intensity of use, consumption of resources, production, and maintenance of viable communities
*&quot;Accessibility&quot; – safe and easy transportation
*&quot;Legibility and wayfinding&quot; – accessible information about travel and destinations
*&quot;Animation&quot; – Designing places to stimulate public activity
*&quot;Function and fit&quot; – places support their varied intended uses
*&quot;Complimentary mixed uses&quot; – Locating activities to allow constructive interaction between them
*&quot;Character and meaning&quot; – Recognizing differences between places
*&quot;Order and incident&quot; – Balancing consistency and variety in the urban environment
*&quot;Continuity and change&quot; – Locating people in time and place, respecting heritage and contemporary culture
*&quot;Civil society&quot; – people are free to interact as civic equals, important for building social capital
*Participation/engagement – including people in the decision-making process can be done at many different scales.

=== Relationships with other related disciplines ===
The original urban design was thought to be separated from architecture and urban planning. Urban Design has developed to a certain extent, and comes from the foundation of engineering. In Anglo-Saxon countries, it is often considered as a branch under the architecture, urban planning, and landscape architecture and limited as the construction of the urban physical environment. However Urban Design is more integrated into the social science-based, cultural, economic, political, and other aspects. Not only focus on space and architectural group, but also look at the whole city from a broader and more holistic perspective to shape a better living environment. Compared to architecture, the spatial and temporal scale of Urban Design processing is much larger. It deals with neighborhoods, communities, and even the entire city.

== The urban design education ==

The University of Liverpool&#x27;s Department of Civic Design is the first urban design school in the world founded in 1909. Following the 1956 Urban Design conference, Harvard University established the first graduate program with urban design in its title, The Master of Architecture in Urban Design, although as a subject taught in universities its history in Europe is far older. Urban design programs explore the built environment from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and points of view. The pedagogically innovative combination of interdisciplinary studios, lecture courses, seminars, and independent study creates an intimate and engaging educational atmosphere in which students thrive and learn. Soon after in 1961, Washington University in St. Louis founded their Master of Urban Design program. Today, twenty urban design programs exist in the United States:

* Andrews University, Berrien Springs, MI
* Clemson University - Charleston, SC
* Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation - New York, NY
* City College of New York - New York, NY
* Estopinal College of Architecture and Planning at Ball State University - Muncie, IN
* Georgia Institute of Technology College of Design - Atlanta, GA
* Harvard Graduate School of Design - Cambridge, MA
* Iowa State University - Ames, IA
* New York Institute of Technology - New York, NY
* Notre Dame School of Architecture - Notre Dame, IN
* Pratt Institute - Brooklyn, NY
* Sam Fox School of Design &amp; Visual Arts at Washington University in St. Louis - St. Louis, MO
* Savannah College of Art and Design - Savannah, GA
* Stuart Weitzman School of Design at University of Pennsylvania - Philadelphia, PA
* Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, MI
* University of California, Berkeley - Berkeley, CA
* University of Colorado Denver - Denver, CO
* University of Maryland - College Park, MD
* University of Miami - Miami, FL
* Stuart Weitzman School of Design at University of Pennsylvania - Philadelphia, PA
* University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture - Austin, TX
* University of North Carolina at Charlotte - Charlotte, NC

In the United Kingdom, Master&#x27;s programmes in Urban Design at University of Manchester or University of Sheffield and Cardiff University or London South Bank University and City Design at the Royal College of Art or Queen&#x27;s University Belfast are offered.

== Issues ==

The field of urban design holds enormous potential for helping us address today&#x27;s biggest challenges: an expanding population, mass urbanization, rising inequality, and climate change. In its practice as well as its theories, urban design attempts to tackle these pressing issues. As climate change progresses, urban design can mitigate the results of flooding, temperature changes, and increasingly detrimental storm impacts through a mindset of sustainability and resilience. In doing so, the urban design discipline attempts to create environments that are constructed with longevity in mind, such as zero-carbon cities. Cities today must be designed to minimize resource consumption, waste generation, and pollution while also withstanding the unprecedented impacts of climate change. To be truly resilient, our cities need to be able to not just bounce back from a catastrophic climate event but to bounce forward to an improved state.

Another issue in this field is that it is often assumed that there are no mothers of planning and urban design. However, this is not the case, many women have made proactive contributions to the field, including the work of Mary Kingsbury Simkhovitch, Florence Kelley, and Lillian Wald, to name a few of whom were prominent leaders in the City Social movement. The City Social was a movement that steamed between the commonly known City Practical and City Beautiful movements. It was a movement mainly concerning lay with the economic and social equalities regarding urban issues.

Justice is and will always be a key issue in urban design. As previously mentioned, past urban strategies have caused injustices within communities incapable of being remedied via simple means. As urban designers tackle the issue of justice, they often are required to look at the injustices of the past and must be careful not to overlook the nuances of race, place, and socioeconomic status in their design efforts. This includes ensuring reasonable access to basic services, transportation, and fighting against gentrification and the commodification of space for economic gain. Organizations such as the Divided Cities Initiatives at Washington University in St. Louis and the Just City Lab at Harvard work on promoting justice in urban design.

Until the 1970s, the design of towns and cities took little account of the needs of people with disabilities. At that time, disabled people began to form movements demanding recognition of their potential contribution if social obstacles were removed. Disabled people challenged the &#x27;medical model&#x27; of disability which saw physical and mental problems as an individual &#x27;tragedy&#x27; and people with disabilities as &#x27;brave&#x27; for enduring them. They proposed instead a &#x27;social model&#x27; which said that barriers to disabled people result from the design of the built environment and attitudes of able-bodied people. &#x27;Access Groups&#x27; were established composed of people with disabilities who audited their local areas, checked planning applications, and made representations for improvements. The new profession of &#x27;access officer&#x27; was established around that time to produce guidelines based on the recommendations of access groups and to oversee adaptations to existing buildings as well as to check on the accessibility of new proposals. Many local authorities now employ access officers who are regulated by the Access Association. A new chapter of the Building Regulations (Part M) was introduced in 1992. Although it was beneficial to have legislation on this issue the requirements were fairly minimal but continue to be improved with ongoing amendments. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 continues to raise awareness and enforce action on disability issues in the urban environment.
The issue of walkability has gained prominence in recent years, not only with the concerns of the aforementioned climate change, but also the health outcomes of residents. Car-centric urban design has an invariably negative effect on such outcomes. With proximity to internal combustion engines, residents tend to suffer from dangerous levels of air pollution which lead to cardiovascular complications ranging from the acute, in hypertension and alterations in heart rate, and the chronic, the outright development of atherosclerosis. More people die from air pollution each year than from car accidents. This issue has been used to fuel movements for alternative forms of long to mid range transportation such as trains and bicycles, with walking as the primary means of short-range travel. This would bring benefits from two simultaneous avenues. The physical activity from walking, and the lack of particulate matter (carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, etc.) has shown to alleviate and lower the risk of many maladies such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Physical activity levels from walking are closely related to the abundance of open public spaces, commercial shops, greenery, among others. These attributes also have been stated to contribute to stronger social and emotional health as the open public spaces facilitate more social interaction within communities. This issue is most prevalent in the United States, where the rise of neoliberalism directly and intentionally caused the car-centric infrastructure.

<text>The Griffin Museum of Science and Industry (MSI), formerly known as the Museum of Science and Industry, is a science museum located in Chicago, Illinois, in Jackson Park, in the Hyde Park neighborhood between Lake Michigan and The University of Chicago. It is housed in the Palace of Fine Arts from the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Initially endowed by Sears, Roebuck and Company president and philanthropist Julius Rosenwald and supported by the Commercial Club of Chicago, it opened in 1933 during the Century of Progress Exposition. It was renamed for benefactor and financier Kenneth C. Griffin on May 19, 2024.

Among the museum&#x27;s most notable exhibits are a full-size replica coal mine, submarine captured during World War II, a United Airlines Boeing 727, the &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot; (the first streamlined diesel-powered passenger train in the US); the command module of the Apollo 8 spacecraft, and a model railroad. Permanent or special exhibits cover manufacturing, environmental science, chemistry, physics, computers, the brain, mechanics of the human body, and agricultural science, among other subjects. 
==History==

The building which now houses the Museum was constructed as the Palace of Fine Arts, built for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition and designed by Charles B. Atwood for D. H. Burnham &amp; Company. During the fair, the palace displayed paintings, prints, drawing, sculpture, and metalwork from around the world. Unlike the other &quot;White City&quot; buildings, it was constructed with a brick substructure under its plaster facade.

After the World&#x27;s Fair, the palace initially housed the Columbian Museum, largely displaying collections left from the fair, which evolved into the Field Museum of Natural History. When the Field Museum moved to a new building five miles north in the Near South Side in 1920, the palace was left vacant.

School of the Art Institute of Chicago professor Lorado Taft led a public campaign to restore the building and turn it into another art museum, one devoted to sculpture. The South Park Commissioners (now part of the Chicago Park District) won approval in a referendum to sell $5 million in bonds to pay for restoration costs, hoping to turn the building into a sculpture museum, a technical trade school, and other things. However, after a few years, the building was selected as the site for a new science museum.

At this time, the Commercial Club of Chicago was interested in establishing a science museum in Chicago. Julius Rosenwald, philanthropist and Sears, Roebuck and Company president, energized his fellow club members by pledging to pay $3 million towards the cost of converting the Palace of Fine Arts (Rosenwald eventually contributed more than $5 million to the project). During its conversion into the MSI, the building&#x27;s exterior was re-cast in limestone to retain its 1893 Beaux Arts look. The interior was replaced with a new one in Art Moderne style designed by Alfred P. Shaw.

Rosenwald established the museum organization in 1926 but declined to have his name on the building. For the first two years of development, the museum was often called the Rosenwald Industrial Museum. In 1928, the name of the museum was officially changed to the Museum of Science and Industry. Rosenwald&#x27;s vision was to create a museum in the style of the Deutsches Museum in Munich, which he had visited in 1911 while in Germany with his family.

Sewell Avery, another businessman, had supported the museum within the Commercial Club and was selected as its first president of the board of directors. The museum conducted a nationwide search for the first director. MSI&#x27;s Board of Directors selected Waldemar Kaempffert, then the science editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, because he shared Rosenwald&#x27;s vision.

He assembled the museum&#x27;s curatorial staff and directed the organization and construction of the exhibits. In order to prepare the museum, Kaempffert and his staff visited the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the Science Museum in Kensington, and the Technical Museum in Vienna, all of which served as models. Kaempffert was instrumental in developing close ties with the science departments of the University of Chicago, which supplied much of the scholarship for the exhibits. Kaempffert resigned in early 1931 amid growing disputes with the second president of the board of directors; they disagreed over the objectivity and neutrality of the exhibits and Kaempffert&#x27;s management of the staff.

The new Museum of Science and Industry opened to the public in three stages between 1933 and 1940. The first opening ceremony took place during the Century of Progress Exposition. Two of the museum&#x27;s presidents, a number of curators and other staff members, and exhibits came to MSI from the Century of Progress event.

In 1992, the museum began planning a series of renovations as part of the &quot;MSI2000&quot; plan. This included an underground three-level parking deck beneath the front lawn. Construction of the underground parking deck was finished in July 1998. These renovations also eventually incorporated a new subterranean main entrance hall which visitors descend into before re-ascending into the main building, similar to the entryway beneath the Louvre Pyramid in Paris.

For the first 5 decades of its operation, general admission to the MSI was free, although certain exhibits (such as the &quot;Coal Mine&quot; and &quot;U-505&quot;) required small fees. General entrance fees were first charged in the early 1990s, with general admission rates increasing from $13 in 2008 to $18 in 2015 and $25.95 in 2024. Many &quot;free days&quot;—for Illinois residents only—are offered throughout the year.

On October 3, 2019, the museum announced that it intended to change its name to the Kenneth C. Griffin Museum of Science and Industry, after a donation of $125 million from billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin. It is the largest single gift in the museum&#x27;s history, effectively doubling its endowment. However, president and chief executive officer David Mosena said the formal name change could take some time, due to the complexity of the process. He also said part of the gift will go into funding &quot;a state-of-the-art digital gallery and performance space that will be the only experience of its kind in North America.&quot; Chevy Humphrey became president and CEO of the private, non-profit museum in January 2021. The new name was officially unveiled on May 19, 2024, alongside an updated logo.

==Exhibits==



The museum has over 2,000 exhibits, displayed in 75 major halls. Many of the major exhibits are permanent or semi-permanent. Access to the &quot;Coal Mine&quot;, &quot;U-505&quot; on-board tour, and other special exhibits requires an additional fee, while other exhibits require a free timed-entry ticket. In keeping with Rosenwald&#x27;s vision for the museum, many of the exhibits are interactive.

===Entry Hall===

==== &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot; ====
The first diesel-powered, streamlined stainless-steel passenger train, the &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot;, is on permanent display in the Entry Hall (previously the Great Hall, renamed in 2008). The train was previously displayed outdoors, before being relocated indoors during the construction of the museum&#x27;s underground parking lot in the 1990s.

==== &quot;NASCAR Next Gen 2023 Ford Mustang&quot; ====
Added to the Entry Hall to coincide with the first NASCAR Chicago Street Race, the Next Gen Ford Mustang is painted by local Chicago artists Paint The City, and showcases modern race-car engineering. It is set to remain at the museum through 2026.

===Lower Level===
====&quot;U-505&quot;====
 is one of just six German submarines captured by the Allies during World War II, and, since its arrival in 1954, the only one on display in the Western Hemisphere. The &quot;U-505&quot; exhibit was dedicated as a permanent war memorial by the museum in 1954, and the submarine was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989.

For its first 50 years at the museum, &quot;U-505&quot; was displayed outdoors. Starting in 2004, the U-boat was newly restored and moved into its current indoor exhibit, which opened as &quot;The New U-505 Experience&quot; on June 5, 2005. The submarine itself is located in a large concrete bunker at the end of the multi-floor exhibit alongside various artifacts found aboard, as well as interactive games related to the operation of a submarine. Guided tours of the submarine&#x27;s interior are offered for an additional fee.

Located outside the entrance to the exhibit, there is both a Mold-A-Rama machine and a penny flattening device with &quot;U-505&quot; designs.

====Henry Crown Space Center====
MSI&#x27;s Henry Crown Space Center is located in its own connected wing on the building&#x27;s southeast side. It opened in 1986, and was extensively renovated and reopened in 2024.

The Space Center includes the Apollo 8 command module, which flew the first human beings around the Moon; the Mercury-Atlas 7 capsule which flew the second American to orbit the Earth; a NASA lunar module trainer used to test procedures for the Apollo lunar landings, and a SpaceX Dragon 1 cargo spacecraft.

Located in the Henry Crown Space Center is the Giant Dome Theater, a domed theater which shows movies on a 5-story wrap-around screen of perforated aluminum (allowing the speakers to be mounted behind the screen and heard throughout the theater).

====&quot;FarmTech&quot;====
The &quot;FarmTech&quot; exhibit showcases modern agricultural techniques and how farmers use modern technology like GPS systems to improve work on the farm, and includes a tractor and a combine harvester from John Deere. The exhibit also showcases a greenhouse, a mock-up of a kitchen showcasing how much of the food we eat comes from soybeans, and how we use cows, from energy to what we drink.

====Other====
The west wing of the museum&#x27;s lower level includes two transportation exhibits, one displaying models of &quot;Ships Through the Ages&quot; and the other a collection of historic racing cars.

The Lower Level includes a number of single-room exhibits. &quot;Black Creativity: Architecture&quot; covers the history of Black architects, as part of the museum&#x27;s wider &quot;Black Creativity&quot; initiative. &quot;Mold-A-Rama&quot;™&quot;: Molded for the Future&quot; showcases several Mold-A-Rama machines and the history and mechanics of injection-molded plastics manufacturing. Colleen Moore&#x27;s Fairy Castle, an intricate miniature fantasy house with decorations inspired by folklore and fairy tales, is also on display, having been at the museum since 1949. &quot;90 and Beyond&quot; opened in 2023 to celebrate MSI&#x27;s 90th anniversary, and showcases objects from each of the 9 decades in the museum&#x27;s history.

There are multiple exhibits on the Lower Level aimed at younger children, including the &quot;Swiss Jollyball&quot;, a kinetic art piece built by a British man from Switzerland using nothing but salvaged junk which showcases a metal ball moving on a track (described by the museum as a &quot;pinball machine&quot;, for which it holds a Guinness World Record as the largest); the &quot;Idea Factory&quot;, a toddler water table play area; and the &quot;Eye Spy&quot; gallery, a hallway with humorous tableaus behind windows.

===First Level===

====Transportation Gallery====
The Transportation Gallery, located in the east wing of the museum on the First and Second Levels, contains several permanent exhibits.

In the middle of the wing is &quot;The Great Train Story&quot;, a HO-scale model railroad which recreates an embellished version of the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; rail line from Chicago to Seattle, with sections depicting downtown Chicago, the Chicago suburbs, the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains and the Cascades, and downtown Seattle with a cargo port.

In the main level of the gallery is NYC &amp; HRR Locomotive No. 999, known as the &quot;Empire State Express&quot;, which is alleged by some sources to have been the first steam locomotive in the world to exceed 100 miles per hour (160km/h). It was donated to the museum in 1962, and displayed outside until being moved indoors and restored in 1993.

The first level of the Transportation Gallery also includes a replica of Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket, which was the first steam locomotive to exceed 25 miles per hour; as well as several carriages and cars showcasing historic and modern road vehicles.

The second level of the Transportation Gallery consists of the &quot;Take Flight&quot; exhibit, which features the first Boeing 727 jet plane in commercial service, donated by United Airlines, with one wing removed and holes cut on the fuselage to facilitate visitor access. A formerly-working replica of the Wright Brothers&#x27; first airplane, the Wright Flyer, is also on display.

Two World War II warplanes are also exhibited, both donated by the British government: a German Ju 87 R-2/Trop. Stuka dive-bomber—one of only two fully-intact Stukas left in the world—and a British Mark 1A Supermarine Spitfire.

====&quot;Science Storms&quot;====
Opened in March 2010, &quot;Science Storms&quot; is a permanent multi-level exhibit which occupies the Allstate Court on the west side of the museum. On the First Level it features a 40-foot (12-meter) water vapor tornado vortex, a rotating sand avalanche disk, a Foucault pendulum suspended from the ceiling, a tsunami wave tank, tethered hot air balloons, a heliostat system with solar panel-powered cars, and a section about light and color; on the Second Level it features a Tesla coil mounted to the ceiling which fires approximately every 30 minutes, a Wimshurst machine built by James Wimshurst in the late 19th century, a giant Newton&#x27;s cradle, and sections on fire, chemistry, and magnetism.

====&quot;Coal Mine&quot;====
Located in and beneath the south end of the museum&#x27;s Central Pavilion, The &quot;Coal Mine&quot; re-creates a working deep-shaft bituminous coal mine, using original equipment from Old Ben #17, a mine in Johnston City, Illinois which closed in 1923. It is the museum&#x27;s oldest exhibit, opening with MSI in 1933. Visitors are led through the exhibit by one or more &quot;coal miner&quot; guides, including a ride on a genuine mine train, and learn the history of unions and the science of coal mining and other types of energy production. The experience takes around 30 minutes and requires an additional fee.

==== Griffin Studio &amp; &quot;Notes to Neurons&quot; ====
Opened in 2024, the Kenneth C. Griffin Studio (or simply Griffin Studio) is an &quot;immersive multimedia experience&quot; with projections, sound, and movement recognition, intended to rotate presentations throughout its life. Its first and current presentation is entitled &quot;Notes to Neurons&quot;, and examines how music interacts with the human mind and body.

==== &quot;Numbers in Nature: A Mirror Maze&quot; ====
&quot;Numbers in Nature: A Mirror Maze&quot; contains interactive stations to learn about patterns in nature, including the Golden Ratio, spirals, fractal branching, and Voronoi patterns. It also contains a mirror maze as a demonstration of geometric patterns. The exhibit requires a free timed entry ticket.

==== &quot;The Blue Paradox&quot; ====
&quot;The Blue Paradox&quot; is an immersive exhibit discussing the ocean plastics crisis which opened on July 1, 2023. Before being relocated to MSI, it was originally a pop-up experience in London, and is sponsored by S.C. Johnson.

====&quot;Genetics: Decoding Life&quot;====
&quot;Genetics: Decoding Life&quot; looks at how genetics affect human and animal development as well as containing a chick hatchery composed of an incubator where baby chickens hatch from their eggs and a chick pen for those that have already hatched, as well as housing genetically modified frogs, mice, and drought resistant plants.

The chick hatchery has been part of the museum since 1956. About 20 chicks are hatched a day, around 140 hatch in a week, and up to 8000 hatch in a year. A week after emerging from their shells, the chicks are sent to the Lincoln Park Zoo to be fed to various animals, including lions, crocodiles, snakes, vultures, owls and tigers. This partnership between the museum and the zoo has been operating for decades, with about 7000 chicks being sent to the zoo each year. Some of the chicks hatched are of the Java species of chicken, and these chicks are sent to a farm in La Fox, Illinois that works to preserve the rare breed. There have been numerous efforts to shut down the exhibit, as early as 1998 and as recent as 2017.

====&quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Main Street&quot;====
&quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Main Street&quot; is a mock-up of a Chicago street from the early 20th century, complete with a cobblestone roadway, old-fashioned light fixtures, fire hydrants, and several shops, including the precursors to several Chicago-based businesses. Included are:

Unlike the other shops, the Nickelodeon Cinema can be entered and is functional, and plays silent films throughout the day.

====&quot;ToyMaker 3000&quot;====
&quot;ToyMaker 3000&quot; is a working assembly line which lets visitors order a &quot;Gravitron&quot; spinning top toy and watch as it is assembled. It is often closed for maintenance.

==== Wanger Family Fab Lab ====
The Wanger Family Fab Lab (or simply &quot;Fab Lab&quot;) is a digital fabrication facility with 3D-printers, laser-cutters, and various other tools and technologies used to create &quot;almost anything you can imagine.&quot; It is visible through windows, but not accessible to the general public, and is used by museum-sponsored workshops and summer camps.

====Other====
&quot;Extreme Ice&quot; is an exhibit showcasing the effect of climate change on Earth&#x27;s polar ice caps, including climate survey equipment, interactive screens, and a large ice wall which visitors can touch.

Opened in spring 2013, &quot;The Art of the Bicycle&quot; showcases the history of bicycles, and how modern bikes continue to evolve.

&quot;Earth Revealed&quot; centers around a &quot;Science on a Sphere&quot; holographic projection globe, and has presentations about planetary science, space exploration, and movies about rising sea levels and water use.

The Whispering Gallery, which opened in 1938, is a room shaped to reflect sound.

===Second Level===
====&quot;YOU! The Experience&quot;====
&quot;YOU! The Experience&quot; is an exhibit about life science and the mechanics of the body, featuring a , interactive, 3D heart, various motion-tracking interactive screens, a human-sized hamster wheel, and plastinated human remains showcasing anatomy.
====Other====
The Regenstein Hall of Chemistry includes a giant periodic table of the elements with samples of each element as well as cases displaying food and materials science.

On display hanging above the &quot;Coal Mine&quot; exhibit is the Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship, nicknamed &quot;Texaco 13&quot;, an airplane which set many world records in flying.

Located in the rear of the &quot;Take Flight&quot; exhibit are a series of flight simulators which allow visitors to fly historic fighter aircraft, and motion simulators which simulate a journey through the sky and/or space.

===Former exhibits===
An F-104 Starfighter on loan to MSI from the US Air Force since 1978 was sent to the Mid-America Air Museum in Liberal, Kansas, in 1993. 

In March 1995, Santa Fe Steam Locomotive 2903 was moved from outside the museum to the Illinois Railway Museum. 

&quot;Telefun Town&quot;, a hall dedicated to the wonders of telephone communication, sponsored by the company then known as the Bell Telephone Company, no longer exists.

One well-known past exhibit was a walk-through model of the human heart, which was removed in 2009 for the construction of &quot;YOU! the Experience&quot;.

&quot;Fast Forward... Inventing the Future&quot;, an exhibit about &quot;cutting-edge&quot; technologies such as hydroponics, space manufacturing and telerobotics, closed in 2022 to make way for the Griffin Studio and &quot;Notes to Neurons&quot;. It was intended as a &quot;rotating gallery&quot;, with sections being changed throughout its run at the museum to reflect new technological developments.

&quot;Out of the Vault&quot;, an exhibit showcasing various objects from MSI&#x27;s collections, closed in 2022 to make way for &quot;The Blue Paradox&quot;. The Spaceport, an exhibit about the fantasy and reality of space exploration with uniforms from &quot;Star Trek&quot; and models of spacecraft on display, also closed in 2022 to make way for &quot;The Blue Paradox&quot;.

&quot;Future Energy Chicago&quot; was an exhibit showcasing alternative resources and energy production with a focus on energy use in the future. It officially closed in August 2022.
====&quot;Genetics: Decoding Life&quot;====
&quot;Genetics: Decoding Life&quot; looks at how genetics affect human and animal development as well as containing a chick hatchery composed of an incubator where baby chickens hatch from their eggs and a chick pen for those that have already hatched, as well as housing genetically modified frogs, mice, and drought resistant plants.

The chick hatchery has been part of the museum since 1956. About 20 chicks are hatched a day, around 140 hatch in a week, and up to 8000 hatch in a year.

Some of the chicks hatched are of the Java species of chicken, and these chicks are sent to a farm in La Fox, Illinois that works to preserve the rare breed. There have been numerous efforts to shut down the exhibit, as early as 1998 and as recent as 2017. The exhibit has since been closed sometime between 2023 and 2024.

<text>In probability theory and statistics, the multivariate normal distribution, multivariate Gaussian distribution, or joint normal distribution is a generalization of the one-dimensional (univariate) normal distribution to higher dimensions. One definition is that a random vector is said to be &quot;k&quot;-variate normally distributed if every linear combination of its &quot;k&quot; components has a univariate normal distribution. Its importance derives mainly from the multivariate central limit theorem. The multivariate normal distribution is often used to describe, at least approximately, any set of (possibly) correlated real-valued random variables, each of which clusters around a mean value.

== Definitions ==
=== Notation and parametrization ===
The multivariate normal distribution of a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional random vector formula_1 can be written in the following notation:
: formula_2
or to make it explicitly known that formula_3 is &quot;k&quot;-dimensional,
: formula_4
with &quot;k&quot;-dimensional mean vector
:formula_5
and formula_6 covariance matrix
:formula_7
such that formula_8 and formula_9. The inverse of the covariance matrix is called the precision matrix, denoted by formula_10.

===Standard normal random vector===
A real random vector formula_1 is called a standard normal random vector if all of its components formula_12 are independent and each is a zero-mean unit-variance normally distributed random variable, i.e. if formula_13 for all formula_14.

===Centered normal random vector===
A real random vector formula_1 is called a centered normal random vector if there exists a formula_16 matrix formula_17 such that formula_18 has the same distribution as formula_3 where formula_20 is a standard normal random vector with formula_21 components.

===Normal random vector===
A real random vector formula_1 is called a normal random vector if there exists a random formula_21-vector formula_20, which is a standard normal random vector, a formula_25-vector formula_26, and a formula_16 matrix formula_17, such that formula_29.

Formally:

Here the covariance matrix is formula_30.

In the degenerate case where the covariance matrix is singular, the corresponding distribution has no density; see the section below for details. This case arises frequently in statistics; for example, in the distribution of the vector of residuals in the ordinary least squares regression. The formula_12 are in general &quot;not&quot; independent; they can be seen as the result of applying the matrix formula_17 to a collection of independent Gaussian variables formula_20.

=== Equivalent definitions ===
The following definitions are equivalent to the definition given above. A random vector formula_34 has a multivariate normal distribution if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions.
* Every linear combination formula_35 of its components is normally distributed. That is, for any constant vector formula_36, the random variable formula_37 has a univariate normal distribution, where a univariate normal distribution with zero variance is a point mass on its mean.
* There is a &quot;k&quot;-vector formula_38 and a symmetric, positive semidefinite formula_6 matrix formula_40, such that the characteristic function of formula_3 is formula_42

The spherical normal distribution can be characterised as the unique distribution where components are independent in any orthogonal coordinate system.

===Density function===
====Non-degenerate case====
The multivariate normal distribution is said to be &quot;non-degenerate&quot; when the symmetric covariance matrix formula_40 is positive definite. In this case the distribution has density
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where formula_44 is a real &quot;k&quot;-dimensional column vector and formula_45 is the determinant of formula_40, also known as the generalized variance. The equation above reduces to that of the univariate normal distribution if formula_40 is a formula_48 matrix (i.e., a single real number).

The circularly symmetric version of the complex normal distribution has a slightly different form.

Each iso-density locus — the locus of points in &quot;k&quot;-dimensional space each of which gives the same particular value of the density — is an ellipse or its higher-dimensional generalization; hence the multivariate normal is a special case of the elliptical distributions.

The quantity formula_49 is known as the Mahalanobis distance, which represents the distance of the test point formula_44 from the mean formula_51. 
The squared Mahalanobis distance
formula_52 is decomposed into a sum of &quot;k&quot; terms, each term being a product of three meaningful components.
Note that in the case when formula_53, the distribution reduces to a univariate normal distribution and the Mahalanobis distance reduces to the absolute value of the standard score. See also Interval below.

====Bivariate case====
In the 2-dimensional nonsingular case (formula_54), the probability density function of a vector formula_55 is:
formula_56
where formula_57 is the correlation between formula_58 and formula_59 and
where formula_60 and formula_61. In this case,
: formula_62
In the bivariate case, the first equivalent condition for multivariate reconstruction of normality can be made less restrictive as it is sufficient to verify that a countably infinite set of distinct linear combinations of formula_58 and formula_59 are normal in order to conclude that the vector of formula_55 is bivariate normal.

The bivariate iso-density loci plotted in the formula_66-plane are ellipses, whose principal axes are defined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix formula_40 (the major and minor semidiameters of the ellipse equal the square-root of the ordered eigenvalues).
As the absolute value of the correlation parameter formula_57 increases, these loci are squeezed toward the following line :

: formula_69

This is because this expression, with formula_70 (where sgn is the sign function) replaced by formula_57, is the best linear unbiased prediction of formula_59 given a value of formula_58.

====Degenerate case====
If the covariance matrix formula_40 is not full rank, then the multivariate normal distribution is degenerate and does not have a density. More precisely, it does not have a density with respect to &quot;k&quot;-dimensional Lebesgue measure (which is the usual measure assumed in calculus-level probability courses). Only random vectors whose distributions are absolutely continuous with respect to a measure are said to have densities (with respect to that measure). To talk about densities but avoid dealing with measure-theoretic complications it can be simpler to restrict attention to a subset of formula_75 of the coordinates of formula_76 such that the covariance matrix for this subset is positive definite; then the other coordinates may be thought of as an affine function of these selected coordinates.

To talk about densities meaningfully in singular cases, then, we must select a different base measure. Using the disintegration theorem we can define a restriction of Lebesgue measure to the formula_75-dimensional affine subspace of formula_78 where the Gaussian distribution is supported, i.e. formula_79. With respect to this measure the distribution has the density of the following motif:

:formula_80

where formula_81 is the generalized inverse and formula_82 is the pseudo-determinant.

=== Cumulative distribution function ===
The notion of cumulative distribution function (cdf) in dimension 1 can be extended in two ways to the multidimensional case, based on rectangular and ellipsoidal regions.

The first way is to define the cdf formula_83 of a random vector formula_3 as the probability that all components of formula_3 are less than or equal to the corresponding values in the vector formula_76:

:formula_87

Though there is no closed form for formula_83, there are a number of algorithms that estimate it numerically.

Another way is to define the cdf formula_89 as the probability that a sample lies inside the ellipsoid determined by its Mahalanobis distance formula_90 from the Gaussian, a direct generalization of the standard deviation.
In order to compute the values of this function, closed analytic formula exist, as follows.

====Interval====
The interval for the multivariate normal distribution yields a region consisting of those vectors x satisfying

:formula_91

Here formula_44 is a formula_25-dimensional vector, formula_51 is the known formula_25-dimensional mean vector, formula_40 is the known covariance matrix and formula_97 is the quantile function for probability formula_98 of the chi-squared distribution with formula_25 degrees of freedom.
When formula_100 the expression defines the interior of an ellipse and the chi-squared distribution simplifies to an exponential distribution with mean equal to two (rate equal to half).

=== Complementary cumulative distribution function (tail distribution) ===
The complementary cumulative distribution function (ccdf) or the tail distribution 
is defined as formula_101. 
When formula_102, then
the ccdf can be written as a probability the maximum of dependent Gaussian variables:

:formula_103
While no simple closed formula exists for computing the ccdf, the maximum of dependent Gaussian variables can 
be estimated accurately via the Monte Carlo method.

== Properties ==
===Probability in different domains===

The probability content of the multivariate normal in a quadratic domain defined by formula_104 (where formula_105 is a matrix, formula_106 is a vector, and formula_107 is a scalar), which is relevant for Bayesian classification/decision theory using Gaussian discriminant analysis, is given by the generalized chi-squared distribution.
The probability content within any general domain defined by formula_108 (where formula_109 is a general function) can be computed using the numerical method of ray-tracing (Matlab code).

===Higher moments===

The &quot;k&quot;th-order moments of x are given by

:formula_110

where 

The &quot;k&quot;th-order central moments are as follows
where the sum is taken over all allocations of the set formula_111 into &quot;λ&quot; (unordered) pairs. That is, for a &quot;k&quot;th central moment, one sums the products of covariances (the expected value μ is taken to be 0 in the interests of parsimony):

: formula_112

This yields formula_113 terms in the sum (15 in the above case), each being the product of &quot;λ&quot; (in this case 3) covariances. For fourth order moments (four variables) there are three terms. For sixth-order moments there are terms, and for eighth-order moments there are terms.

The covariances are then determined by replacing the terms of the list formula_114 by the corresponding terms of the list consisting of &quot;r&quot;1 ones, then &quot;r&quot;2 twos, etc.. To illustrate this, examine the following 4th-order central moment case:

: formula_115

where formula_116 is the covariance of &quot;Xi&quot; and &quot;Xj&quot;. With the above method one first finds the general case for a &quot;k&quot;th moment with &quot;k&quot; different &quot;X&quot; variables, formula_117, and then one simplifies this accordingly. For example, for formula_118, one lets and one uses the fact that formula_119.

===Functions of a normal vector===
A quadratic form of a normal vector formula_120, formula_121 (where formula_105 is a matrix, formula_106 is a vector, and formula_107 is a scalar), is a generalized chi-squared variable. The direction of a normal vector follows a projected normal distribution.

If formula_109 is a general scalar-valued function of a normal vector, its probability density function, cumulative distribution function, and inverse cumulative distribution function can be computed with the numerical method of ray-tracing (Matlab code).

====Likelihood function====

If the mean and covariance matrix are known, the log likelihood of an observed vector formula_120 is simply the log of the probability density function:

:formula_127,

The circularly symmetric version of the noncentral complex case, where formula_128 is a vector of complex numbers, would be

:formula_129

i.e. with the conjugate transpose (indicated by formula_130) replacing the normal transpose (indicated by formula_131). This is slightly different than in the real case, because the circularly symmetric version of the complex normal distribution has a slightly different form for the normalization constant.

A similar notation is used for multiple linear regression.

Since the log likelihood of a normal vector is a quadratic form of the normal vector, it is distributed as a generalized chi-squared variable.

===Differential entropy===

The differential entropy of the multivariate normal distribution is

formula_132,

where the bars denote the matrix determinant, is the dimensionality of the vector space, and the result has units of nats.

===Kullback–Leibler divergence===
The Kullback–Leibler divergence from formula_133 to formula_134, for non-singular matrices Σ1 and Σ0, is:

:formula_135
where formula_136 denotes the matrix determinant, formula_137 is the trace, formula_138 is the natural logarithm and formula_25 is the dimension of the vector space.

The logarithm must be taken to base &quot;e&quot; since the two terms following the logarithm are themselves base-&quot;e&quot; logarithms of expressions that are either factors of the density function or otherwise arise naturally. The equation therefore gives a result measured in nats. Dividing the entire expression above by log&quot;e&quot; 2 yields the divergence in bits.

When formula_140,

:formula_141

===Mutual information===
The mutual information of two multivariate normal distribution is a special case of the Kullback–Leibler divergence in which formula_142 is the full formula_25 dimensional multivariate distribution and formula_144 is the product of the formula_145 and formula_146 dimensional marginal distributions formula_58 and formula_59, such that formula_149. The mutual information between formula_58 and formula_59 is given by:

:formula_152

where 

:formula_153

If formula_144 is product of formula_25 one-dimensional normal distributions, then in the notation of the Kullback–Leibler divergence section of this article, formula_156 is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal entries of formula_157, and formula_140. The resulting formula for mutual information is:

:formula_159

where formula_160 is the correlation matrix constructed from formula_161.

In the bivariate case the expression for the mutual information is:

:formula_162

===Joint normality===

====Normally distributed and independent====

If formula_58 and formula_59 are normally distributed and independent, this implies they are &quot;jointly normally distributed&quot;, i.e., the pair formula_165 must have multivariate normal distribution. However, a pair of jointly normally distributed variables need not be independent (would only be so if uncorrelated, formula_166 ).

====Two normally distributed random variables need not be jointly bivariate normal====

The fact that two random variables formula_58 and formula_59 both have a normal distribution does not imply that the pair formula_165 has a joint normal distribution. A simple example is one in which X has a normal distribution with expected value 0 and variance 1, and formula_170 if formula_171 and formula_172 if formula_173, where formula_174. There are similar counterexamples for more than two random variables. In general, they sum to a mixture model.

====Correlations and independence====

In general, random variables may be uncorrelated but statistically dependent. But if a random vector has a multivariate normal distribution then any two or more of its components that are uncorrelated are independent. This implies that any two or more of its components that are pairwise independent are independent. But, as pointed out just above, it is &quot;not&quot; true that two random variables that are (&quot;separately&quot;, marginally) normally distributed and uncorrelated are independent.

===Conditional distributions===

If &quot;N&quot;-dimensional x is partitioned as follows
:formula_175

and accordingly μ and Σ are partitioned as follows

:formula_176

:formula_177

then the distribution of x1 conditional on x2 = a is multivariate normal where

:formula_178

and covariance matrix

:formula_179

Here formula_180 is the generalized inverse of formula_181. The matrix formula_182 is the Schur complement of Σ22 in Σ. That is, the equation above is equivalent to inverting the overall covariance matrix, dropping the rows and columns corresponding to the variables being conditioned upon, and inverting back to get the conditional covariance matrix.

Note that knowing that alters the variance, though the new variance does not depend on the specific value of a; perhaps more surprisingly, the mean is shifted by formula_183; compare this with the situation of not knowing the value of a, in which case x1 would have distribution
formula_184.

An interesting fact derived in order to prove this result, is that the random vectors formula_185 and formula_186 are independent.

The matrix Σ12Σ22−1 is known as the matrix of regression coefficients.

==== Bivariate case ====
In the bivariate case where x is partitioned into formula_187 and formula_188, the conditional distribution of formula_187 given formula_188 is

: formula_191

where formula_57 is the correlation coefficient between formula_187 and formula_188.

==== Bivariate conditional expectation ====

=====In the general case=====

:formula_195

The conditional expectation of X1 given X2 is:

: formula_196

Proof: the result is obtained by taking the expectation of the conditional distribution formula_197 above.

=====In the centered case with unit variances=====

:formula_198

The conditional expectation of &quot;X&quot;1 given &quot;X&quot;2 is

: formula_199

and the conditional variance is

: formula_200

thus the conditional variance does not depend on &quot;x&quot;2.

The conditional expectation of &quot;X&quot;1 given that &quot;X&quot;2 is smaller/bigger than &quot;z&quot; is:

:formula_201

:formula_202

where the final ratio here is called the inverse Mills ratio.

Proof: the last two results are obtained using the result formula_199, so that

:formula_204 and then using the properties of the expectation of a truncated normal distribution.

===Marginal distributions===
To obtain the marginal distribution over a subset of multivariate normal random variables, one only needs to drop the irrelevant variables (the variables that one wants to marginalize out) from the mean vector and the covariance matrix. The proof for this follows from the definitions of multivariate normal distributions and linear algebra.

&quot;Example&quot;

Let be multivariate normal random variables with mean vector and covariance matrix Σ (standard parametrization for multivariate normal distributions). Then the joint distribution of is multivariate normal with mean vector and covariance matrix
formula_205.

===Affine transformation===

If is an affine transformation of formula_206 where c is an formula_207 vector of constants and B is a constant formula_208 matrix, then Y has a multivariate normal distribution with expected value and variance BΣBT i.e., formula_209. In particular, any subset of the &quot;Xi&quot; has a marginal distribution that is also multivariate normal.
To see this, consider the following example: to extract the subset (&quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;4)T, use

:formula_210

which extracts the desired elements directly.

Another corollary is that the distribution of , where b is a constant vector with the same number of elements as X and the dot indicates the dot product, is univariate Gaussian with formula_211. This result follows by using

:formula_212
Observe how the positive-definiteness of Σ implies that the variance of the dot product must be positive.

An affine transformation of X such as 2X is not the same as the sum of two independent realisations of X.

===Geometric interpretation===
The equidensity contours of a non-singular multivariate normal distribution are ellipsoids (i.e. affine transformations of hyperspheres) centered at the mean. Hence the multivariate normal distribution is an example of the class of elliptical distributions. The directions of the principal axes of the ellipsoids are given by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix formula_40. The squared relative lengths of the principal axes are given by the corresponding eigenvalues.

If is an eigendecomposition where the columns of U are unit eigenvectors and Λ is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues, then we have

::formula_214

Moreover, U can be chosen to be a rotation matrix, as inverting an axis does not have any effect on &quot;N&quot;(0, Λ), but inverting a column changes the sign of U&#x27;s determinant. The distribution &quot;N&quot;(μ, Σ) is in effect &quot;N&quot;(0, I) scaled by Λ1/2, rotated by U and translated by μ.

Conversely, any choice of μ, full rank matrix U, and positive diagonal entries Λ&quot;i&quot; yields a non-singular multivariate normal distribution. If any Λ&quot;i&quot; is zero and U is square, the resulting covariance matrix UΛUT is singular. Geometrically this means that every contour ellipsoid is infinitely thin and has zero volume in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space, as at least one of the principal axes has length of zero; this is the degenerate case.

&quot;The radius around the true mean in a bivariate normal random variable, re-written in polar coordinates (radius and angle), follows a Hoyt distribution.&quot;

In one dimension the probability of finding a sample of the normal distribution in the interval formula_215 is approximately 68.27%, but in higher dimensions the probability of finding a sample in the region of the standard deviation ellipse is lower.
==Statistical inference==
===Parameter estimation===

The derivation of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution is straightforward.

In short, the probability density function (pdf) of a multivariate normal is

:formula_216

and the ML estimator of the covariance matrix from a sample of &quot;n&quot; observations is 

:formula_217

which is simply the sample covariance matrix. This is a biased estimator whose expectation is

:formula_218

An unbiased sample covariance is

:formula_219 (matrix form; formula_220 is the formula_221 identity matrix, J is a formula_222 matrix of ones; the term in parentheses is thus the formula_222 centering matrix)

The Fisher information matrix for estimating the parameters of a multivariate normal distribution has a closed form expression. This can be used, for example, to compute the Cramér–Rao bound for parameter estimation in this setting. See Fisher information for more details.

===Bayesian inference===
In Bayesian statistics, the conjugate prior of the mean vector is another multivariate normal distribution, and the conjugate prior of the covariance matrix is an inverse-Wishart distribution formula_224 . Suppose then that &quot;n&quot; observations have been made
:formula_225
and that a conjugate prior has been assigned, where
:formula_226
where
:formula_227
and
:formula_228

Then

:formula_229
where
:formula_230

=== Multivariate normality tests ===

Multivariate normality tests check a given set of data for similarity to the multivariate normal distribution. The null hypothesis is that the data set is similar to the normal distribution, therefore a sufficiently small &quot;p&quot;-value indicates non-normal data. Multivariate normality tests include the Cox–Small test
and Smith and Jain&#x27;s adaptation of the Friedman–Rafsky test created by Larry Rafsky and Jerome Friedman.

Mardia&#x27;s test is based on multivariate extensions of skewness and kurtosis measures. For a sample {x1, ..., x&quot;n&quot;} of &quot;k&quot;-dimensional vectors we compute
: formula_231
Under the null hypothesis of multivariate normality, the statistic &quot;A&quot; will have approximately a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom, and &quot;B&quot; will be approximately standard normal &quot;N&quot;(0,1).

Mardia&#x27;s kurtosis statistic is skewed and converges very slowly to the limiting normal distribution. For medium size samples formula_232, the parameters of the asymptotic distribution of the kurtosis statistic are modified For small sample tests (formula_233) empirical critical values are used. Tables of critical values for both statistics are given by Rencher for &quot;k&quot; = 2, 3, 4.

Mardia&#x27;s tests are affine invariant but not consistent. For example, the multivariate skewness test is not consistent against
symmetric non-normal alternatives.

The BHEP test computes the norm of the difference between the empirical characteristic function and the theoretical characteristic function of the normal distribution. Calculation of the norm is performed in the L2(&quot;μ&quot;) space of square-integrable functions with respect to the Gaussian weighting function formula_234. The test statistic is
: formula_235
The limiting distribution of this test statistic is a weighted sum of chi-squared random variables.

A detailed survey of these and other test procedures is available.

===Classification into multivariate normal classes===
====Gaussian Discriminant Analysis====
Suppose that observations (which are vectors) are presumed to come from one of several multivariate normal distributions, with known means and covariances. Then any given observation can be assigned to the distribution from which it has the highest probability of arising. This classification procedure is called Gaussian discriminant analysis.
The classification performance, i.e. probabilities of the different classification outcomes, and the overall classification error, can be computed by the numerical method of ray-tracing (Matlab code).

==Computational methods==
===Drawing values from the distribution===

A widely used method for drawing (sampling) a random vector x from the &quot;N&quot;-dimensional multivariate normal distribution with mean vector μ and covariance matrix Σ works as follows:

# Find any real matrix A such that . When Σ is positive-definite, the Cholesky decomposition is typically used, and the extended form of this decomposition can always be used (as the covariance matrix may be only positive semi-definite) in both cases a suitable matrix A is obtained. An alternative is to use the matrix A = UΛ1/2 obtained from a spectral decomposition Σ = UΛU−1 of Σ. The former approach is more computationally straightforward but the matrices A change for different orderings of the elements of the random vector, while the latter approach gives matrices that are related by simple re-orderings. In theory both approaches give equally good ways of determining a suitable matrix A, but there are differences in computation time.
# Let be a vector whose components are &quot;N&quot; independent standard normal variates (which can be generated, for example, by using the Box–Muller transform).
# Let x be . This has the desired distribution due to the affine transformation property.
